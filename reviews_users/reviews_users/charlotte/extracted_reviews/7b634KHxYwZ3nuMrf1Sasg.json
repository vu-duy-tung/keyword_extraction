I haven't tried the food yet but I bet it's just as yummy.",

I've had this happen more than once to where I've stood there looking at the employees, and them knowing I'm there. However I love nothing more than waiting for someone to take my order when I'm next in line. Needless to say I was finally helped after about ten or so minutes, by someone asking me if I had ordered yet. The staff needs some work, maybe retrained idk. But something has to give with the customer service.",

    "text": "Not just for smoothies, I originally came in for tacos that looks so delicious.  A brand new place that is nice and clean, it has great menu with reasonably priced sandwiches that are quite creative. Their biggest plus in my eyes is the smoothies, I had one of their avocado smoothies that was delicious. their sandwiches are really good, they also have Panini's, flatbread, wraps and tacos. All made fresh to order, they also have combos that are very reasonably priced. Under $10 for a sandwich & a smoothie, you also get a side which I think it's a real bargain considering the freshness of the food. The sides are similar to that sub shops , much healthier however. I had to Santa Fe flat bread which was fairly tasty with chicken, sauce and lots of lettuce it came with the 20 ounce smoothie which was wonderful. My friend had the chicken and bacon sandwich on a Ciabata and a Blueberry smoothie, she asked for a cookie. Her part of the order was more expensive than mine for some reason, i specifically asked for The 1/2 sandwich and smoothie deal. Make sure you do too if that's what you want, be clear!",

I was sad to see that my favorite wrap was no longer offered but their Chipotle Chicken Club Flatbread was very good.   The staff was so genuinely nice and helpful as well so that was a definite plus.  I cannot give much advice on the smoothies since I always get the Jetty Junior - a smaller alternative to the Jetty Punch for those that cannot finish a whole regular smoothie.   I can say, however, that they use real fruit in their smoothies and not just powder. The locations back home had the prep area open for view to the public and you'd always see heaping piles of fresh fruit ready to be used.",

I have had the Turkey Bacon Sandwich and it was bomb.  I actually had ordered a half and half.  Half a sandwich with a smoothie.  It is such a good price!  It wasn't a small smoothie cup either.  It was a regular sized smoothie cup, so I definitely felt that I had received my money's worth.    The staff in there was very pleasant.  When my friends and I arrived there, we were all greeted with smiles.  There was nice friendly chit chat while waiting for our smoothies and food as well.  I feel that the size is a good size.  I didn't count the tables, but they have a good amount in there, and you can definitely look out the window and people/car watch (it's not creepy!...or is it?).  I seriously feel like I'll be stopping by this place every week for their good food and smoothies.",

They both work in the same building as this place. Soom after we realized that the man I went to see, Shane, was a regular here, and lucky me, he was on his smoothie run! Yes I tagged along and that's when it happened.  Shane just ordered 'the usual'. I love blueberries so I went with the Blue Lagoon. THE BEST SMOOTHIE EVER! Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not.

    "text": "A simple, easy and healthy fix, but a franchise nonetheless. I've tried the Sunset Sunrise and the Strawberry Basil Lemonade smoothies along with the Korean BBQ Steak Taco and Bajo Taco. I'm a huge fan of smoothie king so any smoothie I try is up to major competition. I can't say that Tropical compares but it is definitely convenient as I do frequent Metropolitan. The Bajo Taco is my favorite! SO flavorful but a tad bit pricey for the size. On the other hand, the smoothies are reasonably priced (especially the specials they usually have up front)! Will definite be back when I'm in the area and in need of a smoothie fix!",

Their prices are amazing at breakfast time, and for about five bucks I can get a breakfast big enough to share with my boyfriend. The wake up wrap is quite possibly the best version of a breakfast burrito ever made, and their green smoothies are really good.   They just added a new perfectly green smoothie, and it is fantastic. So fantastic that I want to go back tomorrow and get it again. Their smoothies only come in one size: huge, hence the sharing. I'd give it five stars but service can be a little slow.",

Just look at these ingredients: Pineapple (amazing), mango & banana (mmm banana), kale, spinach (personally I don't like anything green but this is healthy and delicious)... See? Smoothies are basically just blended salads.  - Please note that smoothies are made with turbinado. You can request Splenda instead. - Classic Smoothies: Made with non-fat yogurt /low fat. - Superfood Smoothies: Made with fresh fruits & veggies. - Supercharged Smoothies:Made with supplements additions. - Indulgent Smoothies: You name it: Peanut butter, chocolate, coconut, coffee & cappuccino. - Also, they serve food. Such as Caribbean Jerk Wrap/ bowl. In addition to wraps, sandwiches, flatbreads and more.  Four Solid Yelps.",

The restaurant seemed to be short staff due to the amount of people who were waiting for their food. There appeared to be only one woman cooking. Another woman came back from break, but seemed less than pleased to assist the customers.   I wanted a nice refreshing smoothie to use as a meal replacement. I order one with bananas, chocolate, and strawberries. It was so sweet, that I threw half of it away. It simply tasted like a strawberry tootsie roll. Besides it being sweet, it was not pleasing to my taste buds.  I was happy that it was only $6, but I would have rather gone to smoothie king and indulged in $5 Fridays instead. i may return, but not until a few more weeks.",

It's naturally sweetened with dates with a cinnamony banana flavor. It's a perfect smoothie for the morning or even lunch.   I've also had all of the different tacos, the spinach and feta wrap (discontinued unfortunately), and this new chicken and bacon joint (clearly can't remember the name), but it was so good. The King Caesar is good as well. That used to be my go to for a while when I lived in Raleigh.   I go enough to be known. I always get a greeting in the morning, \"Hi Mrs. S!\" I like that. I like that they bring your smoothie to you while you sit and wait.. or your food.   They're pretty quick with getting your food or smoothie to you. There are so many options. I mean there's no need to sell this place. The actual location and staff are cool. I'm feelin them... which is why I continue to stop at this location.   Now that they have a Rewards App makes coming here even sweeter.",

First thing, the staff is just great. Every time I've been here, a young lady (with black-rimmed glasses) has served me and she is just great. Super friendly and provides professional service.  The smoothies are great. Amazing choices and great unusual combinations you don't see often. Then I combine a smoothie with half a sandwich and their sandwiches are just great. I feel like the bread and ingredients are of better quality and fresher than other restaurants. I am always left wishing I just got a whole sandwich with my smoothie.   Finally the price, it's great! It makes the place a gem. I have tried out other places in the same block before shopping (don't go shopping on an empty stomach) and this is the best for price, exceptional food and smoothies quality, efficient service, and clean seating.  Suggestions for improvement: expand outdoor seating. Almost choose another place nearby because they have great outdoor seating on this beautiful evening, but their food just wasn't as good. So came here again and then to write this review. They have two tables, but if they could expand it, I think they will do better for themselves and make it more enjoyable for customers.  Keep it up guys, doing great. You will continue to have my business in the future.",

    "text": "Great, quick food & very cool spot. Located in the metropolitan area across from the Met condominiums/lofts/whatever ;-)  I like this place because it offers an alternative to typical smoothie places (or to typical carry out period!). Their menu opts include a decent variety of salads, sandwiches, wraps and smoothies.  I had the coconut lime chicken salad and half of a coconut curry wrap. The contents were very fresh.   Staff was super sweet and efficient, always a plus. We informed the young lady of some issues and she immediately handled them. As I was leaving one of the ladies saw me carrying my salad container in my hand and offered a bag as I headed out he door. The key is that they seemed genuinely nice and not phony nice just b/c thy work there. That is truly a rarity. I certainly hope to return soon :-)",

    "text": "Smoothies and food are fair priced and  very tasty. The owners are great people too. However their staff is another story. I went In today and the cashier walks up and just stares at me. No hello, how are you, nothing. So I tell her my smoothie and she doesn't tell me the price.. just looks at me so I ask. I hand her the money she takes it and just hands me the receipt. No thank you, it will be out soon, just stares at me and walks away. When my smoothie is ready she simply just puts on the counter and walks away. When you pay $7.00 for a smoothie. It would be nice to get a thank you at least. This is not my first interaction like this with the staff .",

    "text": "Convenient and quick. The marketing leads you to believe it's like a raw juice bar, but be careful because there is a lot of sugar in their drinks and cheese on their food. Totally not knocking the flavor or products, had a smoothie today - just order with more veggies, less fruits and added splenda. Basic menu also moves people along more quickly which is good when you're on the run for lunch. Has a good counter service vibe and really nice staff. Will definitely be back!",

Staff was very friendly and helpful. Being that I'm on a diet I went with the detox island green smoothie which is 182 calories. It comes with spinach, kale, mango, pineapple, ginger. You have to have an acquired taste to like ginger but after a few sips I got into the flavor. Pretty reasonable priced as well! I guess I came at a good time because parking was a breeze and I got a spot right in the front. The have a variety of options and I'd encourage anyone to try it",
