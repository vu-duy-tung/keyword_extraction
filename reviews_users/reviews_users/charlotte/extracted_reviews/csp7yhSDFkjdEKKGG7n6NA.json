I usually go for breakfast food but recently they stopped serving that for lunch. VERY disappointing as their breakfast was a gift from Odin himself. The rest of the menu is good so I managed to move on although now I don't visit as much. The bangers and mash is excellent as well as the Norwegian burger. They would get five stars were it not for the breakfast issue(if you work here and are reading this please bring it back for lunch) but all in all a great place to eat.",

Tucked away in Brevard Court, which might I say, is really a cool little niche of uptown, Valhalla is a nice addition.    Exposed brick interior with the majority of the interior being the bar gives this place a nice neighborhood pub feel.  Combine that with the food and you've got a pretty decent place to grab a pint and a good meal.  I enjoyed the turkey meatballs and side salad when I went but I really want to go back and try some of the other dishes, specifically some of the breakfast items.  Speaking of the breakfast items, they serve it all day long.    Parking for this place is non existent I'm pretty sure, you'll have to find street parking or a lot or a parking deck nearby.",

She brought my friend the wrong order, and when I tried to tell her she held up one finger and then left for 5 minutes. The food was awful but the service was much worse. They were out of fries (you're a pub??) and the Drunken Chicken sandwich had a piece of chicken about half the size of the bread, so not much of a sandwich there (and no honey mustard on it, as it was supposed to have). The tater tots, we picked apart, and there was NO potato in them - just breading.   Meanwhile, I asked for a box 10 minutes ago and am writing this review waiting for it instead of being on my way.   There is a nice park across from it.",

Asked bartender, Bob if we could watch the race and he changed it right away...very nice guy and very attentive. I ordered the Vafler which is a Norwegian waffle with fresh fruit and homemade whipped cream...wow!!! It was so good I didn't even need syrup. Hubby got the steak and egg burrito and said it was good too. He said it could've had a little more egg but still good.    We're native Charlotteans and walked by here many times and finally gave it a try. Been to their sister bar Hooligans many times and love it too. So glad we decided to give Valhalla a try. We'll definitely come back.",

    "text": "Recently opened by one of the owners of the popular soccer bar Courtyard Hooligans, Valhalla Pub and Eatery gives those looking for great food in a great atmosphere more options, at more times of the day, than ever in Brevard Court.  Located in the front corner of Brevard Court along Church Street, Valhalla has the feel of the great hall of Odin from Norse mythology with it's custom built, dark wood bar to the horned helmets and axes adorning the walls.  The menu takes it's queues from the Scandinavian theme with items like a meatball sandwich with house made meatballs in a Norsk brown gravy (think BIG Swedish meatballs in a less creamy gravy) and the Norsk Burger with it's beef and pork patty with Jarlsberg cheese.  If you're more local in your tastes there are standard burgers and salads as well.  But once you get inside Valhalla would you really want to upset Odin and eat the veggie burger?  No, I didn't think so.  The bar is fully stocked for mixed drinks and wine, as well as a good collection of beers on tap and bottled.  Into darts and pool?  Both will be available in the back room with it's 2 TV's to help you stay up to date in the world of sports.  Overall this is a great addition to the ever expanding options in the historic Brevard Court, and be it lunch time or night time Valhalla will be there to welcome you!",

We both had the Norwegian burger which was \"Their blend of beef & pork, gaufrette potatoes, melted Jarlsberg, red onion & Norsk sauce--topped with fried egg\" The meat was more like a frozen oval ground chuck dried out thin patty. No taste at all and about a 1/4 in thick. All their sandwiches are served on a sub roll. The potatoes mashed were excellent. The food was presented very nice. Beer selection was great as well as the service. Place has a pub atmosphere. We would go back for drinks but not for the food.",

We went on a Wednesday evening, it was fairly crowded compared to the New Orleans place across the way so we decided to stop in for some food. Service was pretty decent, place was really cute. Reminds me of a country irish pub, dark and cozy. It seems to be Norwegian themed but very few actual Norwegian dishes (which would have made it really interesting)  I had the fish and chips and my boyfriend got the wings. He said they were lukewarm and unappealing.  My fish was okay, at least not soggy. Both of us had fries which were not warm at all.  Definitely 5 star atmosphere and probably great during a game but not a restaurant by any stretch of the imagination.",

It looks like there is parking at lots and on the street.  During the week you can walk straight through the court from Tryon but they lock it up after hours and you can only access the court from Church.  You can also sit at the outside tables in the court - good for the smokers.  I had a margarita on the rocks - service was fast and friendly.  Very cozy place with a bar and high and low top tables - additionally booths in the main dining area.  I ordered the Swedish Hash - they serve breakfast all day!  Fun!  The Swedish hash was very good - eggs over hash.  I had mine with hot sauce.  Very normal breakfast experience - I would probably try the meatballs next time.  The boyfriend had those and they were AWESOME!!    Will definitely be back.  Thanks guys!",

The sandwiches and fish and chips coming out of the kitchen were huge and amazing-looking, but we were there for breakfast foods. I had the Swedish Hash, which was WAY too much to eat, but delicious with bits of meat interspersed throughout the crispy potatoes and covered with egg. The bread was particularly good too. They even made us a pot of coffee (desperately needed).  I hope to return to Charlotte one day, if for no other reason than to stop in and try some meatballs and maybe a Norsk Burger.",

The wine list is good enough to keep me happy, and the beer selection doesn't disappoint.  Their food is better than your average pub for bar snacks. Its a solid after work or pre ball game choice.",

    "text": "Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 3.25 Stars  Third time here yet my first Yelp review. I got to quit doing this! OK, focus Paul, focus....  Met a buddy who used to work at my company, so I decided to check this place out again as it has been a while. So I got the Nobleman \"Salad\" with Drunken Chicken. I'm thinking to myself, hum, I had a big breakfast, so get a light salad, right?  NOT! WRONG! DON'T GO HERE! The plate is GY-NOR-MUS (translation - Friggin HUGE) as it's filled with DEEP FRIED CHICKEN Strip-like thingys....almost looked like Fish and Chips! Upon first glance, I believe I soiled my pants thinking, how the $&*&!^@#$*! am I EVER going to eat all this? Well I didn't, and I hated to waste this, but I did.  So onto the taste. Well, it TASTED good. My issue is that it was like 70% breading and 30% chicken, or something like that. Pub Cook - you put WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too much batter on the chicken. There is NO need to do that! It can be just as tasty with a LIGHT dip of the batter. Shake it off first....do something. Too much batter makes waste, which is what happened to me here.  The \"salad\" portion was good, with spinach lettuce and egg, red onions and mushrooms, and of course....that thing that makes all \"healthy\" salads unhealthy....BACON!  Ranch dressing was good.....but you'll need more than one little cup for this monster plate. In fact, ask for THREE IF you plan on eating the whole plate.  NOTE TO YOURSELF: IF you can eat the entire plate of this drunken chicken, immediately check into the Overeaters Anonymous of Charlotte location! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!  This place is really more of a bar but their food is overall pretty good. Three stars for the over-breading of the chicken.....and somewhat slow service (they got slammed right after we walked in).  I'd still recommend this place, especially for a drink after work. Small but nicely selected beers on tap.",

Then she let me sample and I would say the same.  Then we got waffle fries fully loaded.the fries were good but the fully loaded lacked the fully part. The cheese barely covered the home top part.the ham and bacon toppings were as little skinny. But the fries stayed crispy not soggy so that was good.  I got the Philly cheeses steak no peppers.and the bread wad really good and fresh. The streak inside was fully covered with cheese. So that part was good I added mushrooms but that was a little lost inside.I had some but not enough as an add on.  Our friends had the fish tacos and fish and chips and liked then. So over all success.  I don't think I would come back to this place just yet there are lots of places to try in this area.",

It's a seat yourself establishment. It's quite small inside. If you're in a rush, best to go elsewhere. Even at its most crowded, there are never more than two staffer working the front of house here. It's slow to order, slow to receive your order, even slower to get any refills or seconds, and even slower than that to get your check and pay.  But the food, beer selection, and vibe keep it at 4 stars. The menu doesn't have a ton of selections, but it's large enough. The burgers are great. The buffalo chicken dip is a definite fav of mine. Skip the salads.  There's several TVs and all tuned to different channels, which is nice.  The staff, when you can get their attention, are very nice and friendly.  Overall, I'm definitely a fan and enjoyed my experiences here.",

Then when I went to order, he told me the item I wanted was \"the worst on the menu\" which really threw me off. I ended up getting the veggie burger and my friend got a salad. The server's switched off at one point and the new server said \"we're all the same\" but I really think the first server tapped out because he didn't like us. When he was originally taking our drink order, he was clearing a table with his back to us half the time. So it was...weird but I would still go back for those pretzel bites!",

They know the menu (food & beer) and are happy to answer questions & help you decide when you can't.  The beer menu changes, not sure how often, but is different and always has new options and seasonal beers every time we get there.  If you are not sure about something on the beer menu ask, they will give you a small taste before you commit.  The food is fantastic.  I always get the lamb burger.   It is delicious!  My husband has had numerous things off the menu and whatever he gets it is always good.  Everything is well prepared and good portions.  The only down side is they don't have desserts.  And you don't leave feeling ripped off, it is good portions for a fair price.  Can't wait for my next trip to Charlotte to get back there again.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Valhalla Pub & Eatery located on historical Brevard Court in Uptown Charlotte. Just a few blocks from Bank of America stadium and Time Warner Cable Arena, this cobblestone courtyard boasts pubs, restaurants, and retail stores in an open-air atmosphere.  Dora here. The eclectic menu, including a few Scandinavian dishes like meatballs, lured us to this intimate corner pub. That, and it was just a few blocks to walk from the Charlotte Convention Center, where we were around lunchtime. Once we got here, choosing a single menu item was tough. And check out this view from inside! :)  The Odin's Pretzel Bites were topped with melted cheese and garlic, and served with ranch dipping sauce. A variation from typical pretzels, these bites were great and reminded me of garlic knots that you would get at a pizza joint.   Dora here. Not me. I took the first bite, and...hmmm. But they grew on me. I would've preferred a jazzy mustard dipping sauce over the ranch. To me, the ranch really didn't add flavor, so I stopped dipping.  I chose the Freya's Fish 'n Chips, Guinness-battered haddock fillets served with my favorite, Tater Tots. The fish was crispy on the outside, light and tender on the inside, and full of flavor. The meal included two large fillets that I could not finish by myself.   Dora here. Some of the best fish I've ever tasted! And yes, I was more than happy to help Ernie finish. :)  I'm a sucker for sandwiches with fruit, any entree actually, especially Granny Smith apples. Add cheddar cheese, bacon, lingonberry aioli, and a heaping portion of turkey, and I was all over The Laghertha's Turkey Sandwich. Huge, so Ernie had to help me with mine. Fair's fair, right?   About the only downer for me was the lack of Sweet n Low. So, if you crave a particular brand of sweetener for your tea, bring your own. :) ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "This review is for drinks and an app in the bar area.  We stopped in before a Saturday matinee at the Knight Theatre (convenient location for doing so!)  We were brought in by Yelp reviews. TIP: There was a check-in special for 10% off food.  They were very very busy.  We found one empty high-top in the bar near the door (burrrrr every time it opened!) where we waited for quite a while before catching anyone's attention.  Understandable though, as the Bartender Gal couldn't possibly have been hustling any faster.  Loved the Bread & Butter Chardonnay I had, and Husband enjoyed a Brew.  We opted to share the Blackened Shrimp.  This enntailed six shrimp that while cooked to a perfect texture, were not in any way blackened.  There were blackening-type spices sprinkled on top AFTER cooking.  Had they been put on and blackened during the cooking process, it would have been indeed blackened shrimp.  That being said they still tasted good.    This place is apparently very popular.  They could sure use more staff as service required much patience, yet was not due to lack of trying on the part of who was working.",

To me, if they are open that late serving beer, they should also offer food.",

    "text": "Valhalla...you had me at Tater Tots.  I went here on a Saturday night to meet some friends.  They swore by this place.  \"The food is so good!\"  \"It's such a hole in the wall, yet it's such a gem!\"  They were totally right.  Here's what to expect.  When you walk in, it looks pretty divey.  It's dark, but thanks to the number of TVs and dim lights, you can read the menu.  The place is small, but not super crowded or loud (I guess if there is big game on, it could get packed pretty quickly).  I sat at the table near the window for some excellent people watching.  Perfect if you're meeting some friends for a drink and a casual night out.  The servers are really nice.  I'm still learning all about North Carolina beers, so I asked for a recommendation based on the beers I usually drink.  Her choice was spot on.  The food was really good.  I had the Viking burger with a side of tater tots.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was FAN-TAS-TIC.  Seriously, one of the most well seasoned burgers I've ever had.  And of course, you can never go wrong with a side of TATER TOTS!!!  Negatives...don't go to this place if you're in any sort of a rush.  I'm pretty sure our waitress got locked in the beer fridge, because she was gone for most of the meal.  They also don't have dessert.  Boo!  I would come back to this place just for the food.  Forget the Pub part.  The menu looked great and if it's any reflection of my first trip, I will soon be a regular.",

    "text": "BEWARE; HORRIBLE SERVICE!  My family and I went to this restaurant today based on the fact that they have good reviews on Yelp!, and the close proximity to our hotel.   When we walked in, the only person working was someone at the bar. We sat ourselves. When I was ordering a drink for my daughter, I asked for apple juice; \" We don't have apple juice.\" I said, \"Ok, how about orange juice?\" She stated, \" We only have fresh squeezed, and fresh squeezed lemonade , but it's $4.\" Thanks for telling me the price, I don't really care, just get us the juice.   She didn't even crack a smile the entire time, and it appeared that we were a bother to her.   My 3 year old daughter started playing with the salt on the table. It came out fast from the dispenser, and made a pile on a small piece of paper with drink specials on it. When the Bartender  (Never got her name, but she has many visual body tattoos and sandy brown hair) came to the table, I asked her if I could please get a plate to put the salt on, so my daughter could play with what remained. She stated, \"A plate? I'm definitely not going to do that, sorry. We need the salt. We also need these things.\" She proceeded to take the paper with the salt away from my daughter who began to cry. We should have left after that.  Who is rude to a 3 year old?   2 STARS: The food was delicious, props to the kitchen. I ordered the Cajun shrimp (not too spicy, delicious sauce and garlic mashed potatoes). My parents ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, and the Lamb Burger with side salad. My husband ordered the Cajun Shrimp Wrap with green beans. Everyone was satisfied overall with the food. Presentation of the food was nice as well. I've attached pictures.   MINUS 3 STARS: Due to the horrible attitude and service of the Bartender. Also, it appeared the most of the other staff was outside opening new patio furniture. Maybe someone else should be helping Crabby Pants McGee wait tables.",

At first glance the menu seems like they just added Norwegian/Viking names to the beginning of traditional American dishes but upon closer inspection you realize that's not the case.   I got a turkey sandwich and well I was thinking I'll be getting a regular sliced turkey sandwich with some mayo a little bacon and some cheese. I was way wrong. First off it was real turkey like at thanksgiving. Next the bacon was super thick cut and excellent. Let's not forget about the bread. Not sure how to describe it other than fresh and appeared to be house made. Mashed potatoes at Valhalla = awesome - that's all I can say.  I also went there for a happy hour and it was great as well. Excellent service and felt like we were just hanging out at a friend's house well until they brought the bill that is. Ha  So give it a try I think you'll really like it.

    "text": "I recently visited Valhalla for the first time before a Knights game uptown. Being from Minnesota, I was excited to see a Viking themed pub in the area and I really wanted to check it out. For those not wanting a long read, I'll sum my review up first, then go into detail. The food tasted great (I had a Norwegian Burger), the pub itself is fairly small with about 5 booths and maybe 7-10 tables plus bar seating, and it was VERY NOISY (I was nearly shouting just to talk across the table). All that said, I would definitely go again just based on the quality of the food and the fact that the draft beer menu is nearly all local beers.  So here's more in depth:  Food: As I said, I ordered the Norwegian Burger. I figure that if I'm going to try a new restaurant, I should order something particular to that place. And I was not disappointed. It was delicious. It consisted of a mixed pork and sausage burger on what seemed to be a sub roll, with cheese and an over-easy egg, along with dressing of some sort (I forget what exactly now). I also opted for the bacon on it as an advertised extra for $1.50. The bacon was good, but it was exactly 1 strip of bacon for $1.50. Waaayyyyyy overpriced. Aside from the added unnecessary cost of the bacon though, it was a well priced burger, and I would definitely order it again, sans bacon. It also came with tater tots, and they were perfect, nice and crispy.  Drinks: Their draft beer menu is mostly local beers, which is great. And they also have fresh squeezed juice cocktails, which we didn't get but looked good. I may actually go back to try their spiked lingenberry lemonade.  Decor: Valhalla is a small pub with random viking themed art on the walls. I personally liked the decor, pretty simple but effective.  Noise: Here's where I felt the biggest issue was with Valhalla. The noise level was pretty ridiculous, and not for what seemed to be any good reason. There wasn't a band playing, and the music piped through the speakers wasn't exceptionally loud either. I'm fairly certain it all comes down to acoustics. The magnification of all of the small talk from everyone in the pub mad it necessary to shout just to talk to my wife across the table. And I'm not some old man that can't hear, it was just crazy loud. I wondered if there was anything they could install in the ceilings to try and absorb just some of that sound. It was pretty busy in there while we were there (it was a Saturday before a Knights game), so I wasn't expecting quiet at all. I really do think it just comes down to the acoustics of the pub itself.  Again, to sum it up: Great food, great beer, just make sure to bring your earplugs ;-)",

I enjoy that area alot (Brevard Court) and always thought it's an under-appreciated affordable area in the otherwise expensive and pretentcious Uptown.  The place had a few patrons that late morning, but with only one waitress who also worked as the bartender, service was a little slow. But the most disappointing part was the food/menu in relation to the price. For over $10 I got fried eggs and a so-called hash which was nothing more than fried cut up potato with microscopically diced sausage/bacon/onion. The entire dish lacked flavor. And THAT was their signature dish for brunch (as I asked the waitress for input). I think I'll just come back to this area for a relaxing night out instead. Food is not the forte. There are too many good brunch spots in and around Uptown for that price range.",

If this is what food is like in Norway, I understand why so many Norwegians moved here.  Furthermore it explains why Vikings were pissed off all the time.  Did I give it too many stars for a meh?",

While it was a holiday, they were not extremely busy during our visit. Loved the decor and the food was great ... we both got fish and chips.  What brings my review down is that the service we got was not that great. I felt like we had a black sheet over our table and were forgotten about. Every one around us seemed to be getting good service but it was a struggle for us. When someone did come by it was really rushed and the server was practically walking away while we were still talking.",

Still the other two are quite tasty and the staff is friendly and accommodating.   I know it feels sort of too clean and corporate for some but the food, drink and service is so much better than the French Quarter across the alley that I'm not sure why you'd still go there. I guess it being divey-er is cool and all but if your food, booze, and service aren't as good is it still worth it?",

    "text": "In the last two days I've eaten three meals at Valhalla.  It's True.  I would not lie about something that puts me at a slight risk for appearing to be that creepy guy that hangs out at the bar all weekend.  No, I HAD to eat three meals there so I could write a proper review of the restaurant.  I did it all for the cause.    Prior to eating here the only Scandinavian food I'd ever eaten was at Ikea. There was also that cereal in the 80s with the Swedish Chef on the box (please tell me that you guys remember Croonchy Stars), so I guess I can count my Scandinavian experience on 2 fingers.  While the menu leans heavily toward Scandinavian food, the diversity of the owners'  backgrounds are reflected in items such as the English breakfast and an amazing curry sauce.  Let me pause for a moment to tell you that I could drink both the curry sauce and the brown gravy from a mug.  Or a horn.  Both are staples on the menu and both are family recipes that the owners were kind enough to share with the rest of us.  Try the Warrior fries with the curry.  Amazing.  And if you're wondering what a Warrior fry is, it is a waffle fry like they serve at Chick Fil-A but more badass because it is a warrior and the others are not.    Breakfast:  Northern Eggs Benedict.  Two poached eggs on toast with a good portion of smoked salmon, capers, red onion and fried potatoes.  No hollandaise sauce here, so I'll live to see another day.  A beurre blanc replaces hollandaise on the Valhalla menu and I found it perfect and not overpowering.    Lunch:  The Mighty Meatball.  Pork and beef meatballs with brown gravy and choice of a side.  I, of course, chose the Warrior fries.  Eat your heart out, Ikea.  AND you can eat these meatballs without the fear of having to go rug shopping with your wife afterward.    Dinner:  The Banger Butty.  The name alone made me go for this one.  I really like alliteration.  This sandwich is bangers (sausages) with the curry sauce on a roll that must be of Scandinavian origin because it was pale, beautiful and tasty.    Valhalla is not to be missed!  Chances are you'll find me there sooner than later and you can thank me then for my dedication this weekend so that I could bring you this top-flight review.",

I love the location and feel of the place, especially if you can get a little table outside.  I've had the wings and shrimp wrap here, both of which I really enjoyed. Shrimp wrap came with tater tots which were on point and the wrap itself was tasty with good size shrimp inside. I always order wings either naked or dry rub so I can't speak to the sauces here, but the wings are tasty and a good size. They always have a good beer selection and the prices are fair.  Just recently tried the \"Homemade\" Bloody Mary which has a really good taste, it just has A LOT of \"stuff\" in it. By stuff I don't mean the extras like olives, lemon, lime, celery, etc. I mean the seasoning, seeds, pepper bits, etc. I'm not totally sure what it all was, but my straw kept getting clogged and if I drank from the bottom it was overwhelming. You almost have to leave the last few sips in the glass unless you want to chew your bloody mary. Again, it had a great flavor, but not my favorite of \"mixes\".  Overall, this place is a great little hangout with a few friends to grab some bar food and enjoy conversation. We'll definitely be back!",

Valhalla is the official location the the Liverpool Football Club watch parties so I came in around 12:30p to watch the Liverpool match with a friend. Place was PACKED!! We ended up getting a table in the smaller back room to watch. I did not order any food, but they have a great selection of beers including some session offerings from local breweries.  Came BACK to Valhalla that evening, because I have a drinking problem. Actually I was with a group of friends and we had eaten dinner at Ink 'n' Ivy, so we walked over to Valhalla for a nightcap. Decidedly less busy, but still well populated. Had a couple drinks and then everyone bailed out.  I like this place because it is close walking distance to almost anything you want to do in uptown, and they have a really cool vibe (pumping out some 90s pop music on Saturday night). Unfortunately I've not been to Valhalla with food in mind, but will definitely return with that end.",

Rule number one for a sporting event: eat a meal before you start boozing. It sounds simple, right? Of course, it never is. We ventured here around 4pm before the Monday Night Football game. We ordered chips and salsa, the triple grilled cheese with waffle fries, hot dogs with kraut (plus mashed potatoes and gravy), and a couple of quesadillas. Now, I have no idea if they make the gravy from scratch, but I will say it's peppery and absolutely delicious. I will make sure every order I place here included something covered in gravy. The grilled cheese features brie as one of the three. Let's face it, brie makes everything better. A warning about the quesadilla: the Habenero Ranch is no joke. It's a delayed burn after the first taste. The table next to us got the fish and chips and I immediately wanted to order that, too. Huge portion for the fish. It looked really good.  This place was absolutely slammed both inside and on the patio, but the staff never seemed to miss a beat. We had fantastic service and several people waiting on us. Thanks Valhalla for being a consistent game day favorite. Oh, and GO PANTHERS!!! Rarrrrrrrrrrrr.",

Four TVs around for watching events etc. The staff was friendly and efficient.   I had the Norwegian meatballs with brown gravy, waffle fries (everyone was mentioning them in other reviews so I had to try), and toast. It comes with steamed broccoli which I didn't get as I don't eat it. The meatballs looked like little hamburgers but were flavorful and the gravy was delicious. I had a Moscow mule to drink. Complete with the copper mug and fresh squeezed lime juice in it. Mmm.

It was the size of a coffee cup and wasn't at all hot. I asked them to heat it up, which they did without issue. However, what I make at home is better. Overall unimpressed.

The server or waiter was in a state of stress or something happened with him, he was very angry. I did not understand what was happening. I live across the street and often visit this area , I recommend a Greek restaurant and a beer house Hooligans, in these places excellent service and professional staff.  Never visit this place  Vintage Lounge at Valhalla !!!!!!!!!!! p.s if you take a look at pic this place is not busy..... despite the fact that this is an evening of Friday.",

The Pretzel Bites, you only get 12 one biters and have some cheese melted on top, for sure not worth $7. The wings are reasonably priced, but overcooked. The buffalo dip was good, but again for $10 you are not getting enough. With the amount of options in the area, I will not be back.",

Whenever I don't know where my husband is I am pretty certain that he is at Valhalla  It is super cozy inside and the service is always on point. You will never find yourself waiting for a drink.

I am a huge fan of the turkey sandwich that comes on toast with cheddar and bacon and green apple slices...YUM. Also, the chicken bites to start (try them tossed in the blueberry chipotle sauce), Buffalo chicken dip and hummus are all awesome. My husband loves the Chipotle turkey wrap. They also serve tater tots...need I say more?! They own the wine bar that is connected and it's also a very cozy, intimate spot to grab a bottle of wine. The breakfast menu is also awesome and they serve a mean mimosa with fresh squeezed OJ! Definitely check this place out!",

It seems to be a very local oriented place so the service assumed we knew what we wanted to drink as soon as we sat down. We needed to look at the choices. So it took a while to get our order. We were not ready to order food but told service we just needed to figure out the menu. Service never came back. The server switched to being the bartender so I went up and told her were ready to order. I was nice about it. She didn't react well. We waited for another ten minutes and no service so we left money on the table and left. I have never written a negative review for anything ever until now. Pissed.",

    "text": "Came for drinks on gay pride parade day.  We were pretty worried that it would be crowded.  They were worried, too, and had reduced their menu significantly to prepare.  We were both wrong.    It wasn't crowded but I was disappointed at how little they were offering food-wise.  I did try the fish and chips which everyone had recommended.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The fried batter was great, truly, but it was fried batter.  The fish, on the other hand, was dry.  Not like flaky and delicate.  Like bad.  If this is their best dish, I'd strongly suggest skipping the food altogether.    The drinks were solid.  I tried multiple citrus margaritas--all were impressive.  They have this HUGE citrus press right on the counter of the bar next to a multi-tiered basket stand of citrus fruits.  They seem to do it all.  Lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, all available fresh and freshly squeezed.  The drinks aren't traditional, but with the fresh squeezed juice are undeniably good.  Come here for this.  My friends also enjoyed the variety of beers.    The service was friendly, but slow, even given that they were prepared for a crowd that hadn't yet shown.  We liked everyone we talked to and the staff were very accommodating, but more than half of our drinks needed reminding and we had to track down waters and water refills, napkins, and a bill correction.  Bathrooms were nice, though.    I'd go back, especially to watch a game, but I wouldn't do food there again.",

The wasabi dressing was the star if the dish with it not being abundantly over powering. A good size for two people.  I ordered the fish and chips and just wow. I was concerned that the fish was burnt but that was probably due to the Guinness batter. Great tarter sauce and the waffle fries were pretty good as well.   My wife ordered the grilled chicken with broccoli , delicious. The broccoli was cooked perfectly and the flavors of the sauce in the chicken were outstanding. \"Maybe we will only come here while in charlotte\"-wife   Overall just a solid easy meal with nothing that you have to think too hard about. Great flavors, incredibly fast service for drinks and food.   We will definitely make this a stop when we are in town.",

The fish and chips were amazing. The lamb burger was also fantastic, the mix of spices and toppings were a wonderful balance of a Mediterranean blend with each bite. The bar tenders were also great. Asked for a drink menu and was told everything is made fresh, so they don't really have one.

Although I've yet to partake in the nectar of the Norse  gods, I can surely attest to the hamburgers of the gods.   Viking burger or Norske burger, have at it. I personally prefer the Norske, because it's accompanied with one of my fave things, a fried egg. A massive pork/beef mixture and shaped like a sub sandwich, this burger's a winner folks. At $8, easily one of the best burgers in Charlotte. Not feelin' the hog, opt for the seafarers. Vikings ate fish too ya know.   A great addition to the uptown scene, and I can already see this being one of the hippest spots around.",

The food is very tasty, the price is very affordable and compared to other places - it is very easy to get a table for brunch.  We had our lunch at the outside tables this past weekend and between the great food and the beautiful weather we found ourselves staying longer than we expected to.  I have recommended this place to others as a great place for Sunday Brunch.  It's uptown location prevents me from visiting at other times but for Sunday brunch the parking is plentiful, the service is excellant and the food is tasty.  Highly recommend.  The only thing about Sunday brunch is they are sometimes out of the more popular selections.  There weren't any bangers this Sunday for example.  There were other wonderful selections though that more than made up for the lack - the Northern Eggs Benedict was yum!!",

The veggie burger is one of the best I've ever had... a homemade black bean patty with fresh jalapenos and an incredible homemade salsa and curry sauce.  I also really enjoyed their fish sandwich, with a Guinness breading and malt vinegar.  All in all, it's a GREAT restaurant and one I plan to go back to time and time again.

Came in to watch the World Cup semifinals and had more fun than I could've ever expected. Jody, the bartender, is top notch. She makes a mean drink and is great at chatting it up and making you feel right at home. I will definitely be back here every time I'm in Charlotte and hope that others enjoy this jewel in the Queen City as much as I do.",

The place was empty with the exception of a guy sitting at the bar with his back to us. There was no reaction such as a welcome or whatever, so I said \"Hello.\" This rude guy finally acknowledged our presence. I asked if they were open. His response? You walked in, didn't you? He didn't tell us where the main dinging area was, so we just walked until we found it. My sister and I were talking about how rude he was. He followed us to our table very aggressively and yelled at us to leave. We were floored. He then went whining like a little girl to a woman behind the bar, who I assume was a manager. She attempted to calm him down and offered to seat us again. No thanks. Too many other restaurants around where they know how to treat customers. I think the little fellow had an extreme case of the Napoleon Complex. I will spread the word and discourage others from enduring what we endured there with that weird little man.",

He rattled off the menu like an old pro.   Uptown on a rare Sunday evening landed us here after realizing we were too \"seasoned\" (aka Old) for the Ink and Ivy crowd. Glad we remembered the French Quarter area and stumbled upon this gem.   We were initially seated in the front. It was a tad tight for our taste and a friend realized there was more seating in the back area of the pub. Perfect! The four of us had that entire area to ourselves. Even though we were tucked away from the crowd, we were never forgotten.   Joe explained the drinks and I had one of the best glasses of Malbec ever; Joe suggested it and even brought the bottle for me to snap a picture. We also had a few tequila shots with very generous pours for the birthday guy we were celebrating.   I chose the Cajun shrimp wrap minus the lettuce and tomatoes and it was WONDERFUL! Joe was concerned the wrap might be too thin without the veggie trimmings but it wasn't. It has just enough heat and the shrimp were plentiful. Others at my table had wings that they also said were tasty.   Cute location in the heart of Uptown. Awesome customer service. Great food. You've got to check this spot out!",

Charlotte's version is bite size compared to other cities but it does pack a stylish punch. We were set up in the back room so we could all sit together, about 20 of us. The two bartenders/servers were on point keeping drinks full and getting food orders, once we all arrived. The kitchen seemed over-whelmed, because the food was VERY scattered. Some of us received plates, finished our food and our plates were taken before others received theirs. I don't typically like to eat until everyone has been served, but that was a long differential.  Otherwise, Valhalla was incredibly accommodating and had some delicious beverage specials. It's also stationed below the Cotton Room, which is also INCREDIBLY SMALL, quaint maybe; but is convenient for the after party.",

The place was pretty busy when we walked in and I thought \"oh boy, it's gonna be a while before we get served.\" We were luck enough to grab a table and before we could even sit, had a server handing us menus, ready to take our order. Great service.  My son ordered the Ahi tuna, which he said was great. I wanted to try, but he ate them up to fast.  My wife is celiac and there's not much to offer a person here who's gluten free. So we ordered the chips and salsa. Unfortunately she got sick from what I assume was cross contamination in the fryer oil. Put a damper on the rest of our night because she wasn't feeling well.  It was our fault though. Should have been more careful.  This is the second time we've been to Valhalla and it's a cool bar in a hopping spot Uptown.",

I like breakfast to be before 9AM and the next meal to be a hearty lunch, so when we ventured to Valhalla and received menus I was anxious that at 10AM (special early opening for the soccer game) I would have to eat eggs again. I did not need to fret because even though it was early the waiter said their full menu was on service! For that reason alone this is now a contender for all soccer matches we see in the city.   I ordered the spiked lingonberry lemonade and it was light, refreshing and unique to the offerings of the bars nearby. If you go, don't be like me and ask for a straw. They are a straw free establishment due to environmental concerns. Cue moderate embarrassment on my part, and some difficulty navigating around the ice to get the last of my drink.   For my main I had the Swedish meatballs which were covered in robust gravy. The broccoli side was well steamed and the potatoes were delicious. It was also served with a side of toast which was a good vessel for the extra gravy.   The service was attentive and the food a great base for a day of sports and drinking. Worthy of a visit!",

I got the Cuban and green beans and was nearly able to finish it all.  There was so much meat on the sandwich that I had to give up (and I hadn't eaten lunch that day)!  The ambiance is definitely that of a friendly neighborhood pub.  There were plenty of groups of friends hanging out after watching some of the World Cup.

What I can say is there were adequate televisions around, and blessedly they had the fans going to cool the crowd down.    They didn't have any beers that I wanted, and their prices were a bit inflated.  The ladies bathrooms smelled like a piss pot.    The wait staff was a bunch of snotty, blondes with funky looking shorts, wedged severely and probably painfully into their board-flat behinds, sneakers and a metric ton of trashy makeup.  In fairness they could have just had long hard days, with the huge influx of customers, but they all seemed to have resting bitch faces and attitudes to match.   There were cups, trash and plates of discarded food all over all of the tables.  Since there were kids all around someone could have gotten hurt.  I am not sure why no attempts were made to discard the dirty cups and plates.    Who knows perhaps I will go there on another day and have a different experience.

    "text": "After spending a few hours walking around Charlotte on a quiet afternoon we started eyeballing restaurants to see which one struck our fancy.  My husband suggested Valhalla as we walked by and said he'd been once before and liked it so we went in.    I walked in and realized that if I ever owned a pub, this is the kind I'd want to own.  It's small and warm (meaning it's got lots of wood everywhere which gives it a cozy feel) and the bartender immediately acknowledged us as we entered and told us to sit anywhere we wanted.  I liked the vibe here immensely.  We chose a small booth and the chalk drawing of the skull glass caught my husband's eye, he loved it.  I took a pic for you to see.  There were two tv's with football games on but they weren't loud so you could follow along or not, as you chose.  We were quickly approached for a drink order by the bartender and when he went off to make them, a friendly server came over and asked us if we'd like a drink.  They are prompt and efficient here, for sure!  Drinks came and the server came back to see if we wanted food too (it was mid-afternoon) and we asked her for some recommendations.  She suggested Gmot's Grilled Chicken, Lodbrok's Lamb Burger, and Freya's Fish and Chips.  My husband had already spied the enormous deep fried haddock on a neighboring table's plate so he took her Fish and Chips recommendation. Light and crispy, it was the ultimate comfort food of Guinness battered haddock filet served on a bed of waffle fries with house made tartar sauce (that truly tastes housemade) and slaw.  $12.  I'd decided the Rollo's Pulled Pork Tacos sounded good this afternoon and received a plate of three well stuffed pork tacos, pulled pork made in house, in flour tortillas topped with cilantro and red cabbage slaw and drizzled with a chipotle blueberry BBQ sauce, also $12.  While good, they were need just a little bit of kick, maybe minced jalapeno?  I'm not sure, I couldn't put my finger on what I'd add.  Tacos don't come with any sides so I added some tater tots which were perfectly cooked (if you read my reviews you know I'm picky about using clean fry oil for fried foods).  These were perfectly done, in my book.  The food came out quickly, we'd only had about a third of our craft beers.  Service was consistently pleasant, and we had frequent check-ins by our server/I could see her looking over at our table to make sure all was well.    If I lived in walking distance of Valhalla, I'd quickly become a frequent patron.  I just really liked the coziness and friendliness of this pub.  I wish we had someplace like this up at Lake Norman!!  Stop in and give it a shot.  Definitely will revisit when I'm back down in Charlotte.",

The waitress/bartender was so kind and efficient. We each ordered a drink - I had the Crabbie's Ginger Beer (YUM) and my husband enjoyed a Blue Blaze local brew.   I had the shrimp wrap which was delicious but maybe a bit sparse on shrimp. For under $10 with the Yelp check-in coupon, I was totally okay with this. My husband loved the fried chicken sandwich with pineapple. I tried a bite of the chicken and it was crispy and moist inside. Delicious.   We will certainly be back! Thanks for a great meal.",

    "text": "My bestie from college was in town on a layover and wanted to hang out.  I suggested that we hang out Uptown, because I immediately thought of Valhalla because I've always seen it but never had a chance to experience it.  This place is small, quaint and on a Thursday night around 8 p.m. it wasn't very busy.  I ordered the cheeseburger with tater tots.  ANY restaurant that serve tater tots is OK in my book!  The burger was well-seasoned and came with tomato, onion and lettuce.  I think there was a condiment spread on the bun, but I was too hungry to pay close attention to what it was.  My friends ordered the wings and the lamb burger.  They both agreed that it was delicious.  I sampled the buffalo wing with the wasabi ranch.  This is an awesome match!  You get the heat from the wing flavor and the kick from the wasabi.  Next, time I will try to be here for happy hour; which will probably be a little more crowded.  The service was excellent, the waitstaff was attentive and very accommodating with our questions.",

Valhalla is cool all around.  Friendly bartenders and tasty meatballs.   It's sort of an Indian/Norwegian fusion corner bar next to the few \"real\" bars in Charlotte.  I despise the touristy financial district so have been spending way too much money on cab rides exploring the south end, NoDa and Plaza Midwood.  This is much easier and is a common after work drinking hole place for the non-cheesy Charlotte workers.  I dig it.  The beer selection is a bit limited but the owners can pull from Vintage Wine Shop as well.   Never had a bad meal there....craving those meatballs with curry as I write this actually.    Not sure if this counts as ironic, but I saw an old episode of Frasier the other day where Niles is discussing the new \"hot\" restaurant in town....an Indian/Norwegian fusion place.   I was like, holy shit, that place actually exists.  Definitely worth checking out.",

The Norsk burger was a big hit (how can it not be with that thick slice of bacon and fried egg?), I LOVED my drunken chicken (I really thought I would be in need of a condiment, but that pineapple did an excellent job), the triple grilled cheese was tasty, and the bangers and mash hit home. Of course the waffle fries were awesome (who doesn't like waffle fries?) and the wings were quoted as being some of the \"best (they'd) ever had\".   Delish cider, good beers on tap, and a good amount of tvs to catch any game, I'll be back!",

I'm normally able to handle extremely spicy foods but the dressing ended up being way too much for me. The waitress did not warn me, or check to see if the food was okay. I couldn't even finish the salad because my mouth burned so much. Mind, the pub was super busy and our waitress seemed to be handling most of the tables on her own.

I only tried a few to-go Viking burgers during a brief trip to downtown Charlotte, and they were really good. Service could have been better. Even for to-go orders when the bag was right there on the counter and like no one at the bar, it took about as long as a packed dance club bartender to be noticed and rung (ringed?) up.",

We were new to the town, and had no idea what kind of place this would be. After our first visit this has quickly become one of our favorite spots in Uptown!   It's a very fun, casual environment, with awesome decor. The waitstaff is always very friendly and helpful. It's a pub, so the service isn't quick. But, if you are going to just enjoy your time, it's well worth the wait.   We got the grilled cheese sandwich and black bean burger. Both were fantastic! Delicious food, and a great beer selection. What more can you ask for?",

When I asked for silverware she loudly pointed out that it was on the other side of the table and why had i not seen it?   People at a table next to us so I didn't take them an hour to get what they ordered. Lest you think it was crazy busy it was 5 o'clock on a Saturday, not really all that busy.  There are a lot of restaurants in this area, surely one of them is better than this.",

The interior is cozy and welcoming, and it makes you feel like a True Nord.

Valhalla is the perfect lunch spot if you're looking for something heavy to coat your stomach before after work drinks, just want a wholesome warm lunch, or want a fresh salad.  I've had the lamb burger and the chicken sandwich.  My husband got the seafarer sandwich and it was amazing!  I love that they make their sauces in house, because I'm a sauce queen and they get five stars just off the strength of having great sauces.  The food is so fresh, and you know it was made to order!  The servers are attentive, and pleasant.  After eating all that heavy food, you'll need to walk it down around the perimeter of Romare Bearden which is right across the street.  If you're going to a Knights game, Panthers game, or out drinking this is the place to fill up before a big night.  I can't wait to go back and try the wings next time, and I'll take some pics.",

It doesn't disappoint.  It's like a sub roll with seasoned ground beef/chicken combination with veggies and amazing cheese.  Definitely want to grab lunch here again at some point.  I like the place.  Looks clean and has a nice lil theme to it.  Since I came in the daytime, couldn't tell what it's like at night, but the French Quarter area(?) of uptown Charlotte seems like a hip little place to hang out.  Not there there's a lot of bars or anything but seems quaint and a little low-key.  Who knows, maybe it's poppin' like the Epicentre.  Pet peeve:  finished meal wait for check, server drops off check, and disappears for ten minutes, picks up the check and disappears again for ten minutes, returns with our change.  I don't know about you but I hate the whole process and how long it takes.  I think the gap between dropping off the check and picking up the check takes way too long generally--but I can see how some people like to just eat, get the check, and sit there...I like to slip them the credit card, the minute the bill comes--kinda speeds up the process. ::Rant mode off:   They were uber-slow in that respect.  dmo out.",

We had waited forever for a refill of soda & finally got it, got up to go the the bathroom & they threw everything out, including my bottled water. I complained but they were not apologetic at all.

However, my disappointment led to delight when I saw that they had all kinds of burgers that would make a viking proud. I got one that was topped with a fried egg on top. How Scandinavian is that?! The burger was filling and delicious. It came with fries, which didn't look like they were straight from Oslo, but still pretty good.  I enjoyed the fact that they have a great location at the front of an old-timey food court and mall. There's plenty of bicycle parking out in front, along with a nice little \"parklett\" that you can take your food to go.  The interior looks like someone raided an old barn and tacked up the siding all on the walls, giving it a rustic feel.  They serve a variety of beers, including some local craft beers.  The service was good, and the place was clean.  In the restrooms, check out the sink- it looks like a mystical whiskey barrel that you can use to wash your hands.

The only thing holding my review back from 5 stars is the crowd. The staff does a great job serving everybody at crowded times in an efficient manner, but Valhalla has a magnet for the most annoying patrons in Brevard Court. Maybe it's because they are in front and provide a buffer for some of the places further down the alley that don't have annoying patrons. I'll keep going to Valhalla because the pros way outweigh the cons and will just continue to build up my resistance to terrible people who act like they are experiencing a drink for the first time or make demands like you would only see at a place that offers bottle service.",

I got a burger, it was on long French bread (different, neat idea) but the burger was flat and over cooked. The waffle fries were crunchy though, exactly how I like them. Just not super impressive.   The saving grace for this place was their ability to handle the crowd just before Fan Fest. We walked inside, and were able to get beers pretty quickly. I was probably a half hour away from the hangry zone - so we easily grabbed a table. (Plan ahead, avoid hangry! Success!) it was my first time here and I really liked the feel of the place. We were so anxious about getting food and over to the Stadiium, that I didn't look at my Yelp app. The food was ok. But the service was fast and ambiance was cool. 3 stars. I'll update after I go back and try the Norwegian burger, hopefully that will raise the rating.",

Make it a cheat day so you can have the eggs, crispy potatoes, thick cut bacon, and eggs with swiss on top. The toast is some of the best bread I've had. Waitress was cool and knowledgeable, and attentive. I have to admit, I wanted a traditional brunch in a \"nice\" place, but I'm so glad I stayed. My bf and I both agreed it was one of the best breakfasts we've ever had.",

    "text": "Big fan of this place!   We came here on Friday evening after a concert in Uptown. There really isn't an actual parking lot....though, that isn't exactly an issue for us since we live in Uptown and walk everywhere!  The bartenders are great. One of the female bartenders asked our names and for the entire night called us by name......I like that personal touch. She was making a margarita and my husband and I were talking abt how we wondered what it tasted like (it had some weird ingredient in it). The bartender overheard us and made a little extra for us to try a taste! That kind of service is what keeps customers coming back!  We ordered the loaded fries with pot roast.......yeah, I know, not that great for you.....but man, it was amazing!!! The loaded fries had ham, pot roast, cheese, corn, and jalapenos on them. If you are going to break a diet, this is the ONLY way to do it!   Will obviously be coming back for great food, amazing service, and cold beers!",

My only problem is that when we came there the next day before football game, all the tables were occupied and I needed lunch before he game. However, the bartenders did not take orders at the bar because \"they wouldn't be able to serve everyone.\" We took our drinks and took our business elsewhere. I will definitely be back but probably not on a game day.",

    "text": "If there were half stars this place would be more like a 3.5. The atmosphere and food are pretty good here. I've had the fish and chips once and wings another time. Good local beer menu as well. The things that make this place less than a 4 are the lack of menu options and that there really isn't anything unique or overly exciting about the food. The bartender that served us seemed like he hated his job. He was not personal at all and literally would drop the food off and never come back to ask how things were. Several times we were sitting with empty beers and it was not a busy night. Might stop by for a drink if I'm in the area bar hopping but not a go-to bar for me by any means. Just meh.",

Awesome spot before a game, great drink/beer selection, and really good service.  Great atmosphere and really cool shirts, if you are into the whole viking thing.  I loved it, and this is my spot when I return to Charlotte.",

I was skeptical it would be too crowded and loud to enjoy dinner and was not expecting the service to be great because of the crowd. I was pleasantly surprised! The service was excellent and the food was great. The atmosphere was loud but nothing out of control. Overall, great experience!",

    "text": "If you're looking for brunch, this is no longer your spot. They have done away with their brunch menu recently due to the fact that they could not accommodate large game day crowds. This is unfortunate, and I expect they will need to put brunch back on the menu soon because it was very popular.  However, the bartender was extremely friendly and accommodated by allowing my friend and I to order from their old brunch menu. This happened after I mentioned that their website still advertised Saturday and Sunday brunch. I ordered the Norwegian Eggs Benedict, which was fantastic. The food was good! Their Bloody Marys were decent. I think they got busy and forgot to put some of the extras in our drinks (ex pickled asparagus, even though there was a jar sitting on the bar top). Overall: A great experience, fantastic location, friendly staff, good food, decent prices. I will definitely be returning.",
