I've been three times and always enjoyed the food and had good experiences.  The service is excellent.  I've gotten the same waiter on three visits and he goes through the menu and handles all his service bilingually, which is a nice touch for my taste.  They have a nice menu, good variety, but not so many choices you are overwhelmed.  They have a good wine selection as well as traditional Italian coffee options to accompany their dessert menu.    The location is in a strip mall but they have expanded out onto the side walk for year-round outdoor seating.  Also, they make homemade gnocchi on Tuesdays - could be a gimmick, but a place that only makes a dish once a week gets my attention.  Overall this is a great place to take a date for a nice evening out.",

    "text": "I am no longer a resident of Charlotte but if I were this would be a regular stop for me. My wife and I were in town visiting my family for the holidays. My mother had mentioned going here before but it had never worked out. The restaurant is located at the intersection of Kenilworth and East Blvd. Anyway, we finally made it and boy was it delicious. We had a 1 PM reservation so it wasn't very crowded when we arrived. Parking is somewhat of a problem as there are a number of businesses in this one area. Our waiter's name was Jeff and he was very attentive. We didn't order any drinks just our meal. My wife and mom ordered the shrimp scampi and split a Caesar salad and I ordered the Bolognese pasta with the Mista salad. When ordering Jeff told us the sides of the day were green beans and polenta. My wife and mom opted to get a pasta side (a $3 surcharge) as well. The salads were brought out and were were quite nice, not too small or too large. The Caesar is large enough for 2 people to split if all they want is a small salad before a meal. The Mista is a nice before meal salad as well. The dressing were nice without being overly heavy. We were also brought house bread. The bread was okay but I felt like it was the weakest part of the meal, nothing special. Interestingly enough we were served butter instead of oil and herbs. A little later we were served our entrees. My Bolognese was outstanding, quite hearty with a what I believe to have been a pork and veal combo with tomatoes and cheese. Rich and delicious served over spaghetti. The shrimp scampi was actually butterflied shrimp stuffed with garlic, parsley and other herbs. The pasta was drizzled with scampi sauce. One thing that was odd is that they charge you a $3 surcharge for the pasta and they don't bring you the side vegetables. We asked for them and they did bring them to us. I personally believe that if you want pasta in lieu of the side vegetables there should not be an additional charge. I mean how much does a cup of pasta cost? Luckily we did ask for the side vegetables because they were delicious. We had a nice leisurely lunch and enjoyed it immensely. I will most certainly return!",

They switch it up seasonally, so if you haven't been in a while, you can always expect a surprise if you come back later. I really like the diversity, and in my opinion, the food is authentically Italian. It's as good as you'll get in the Charlotte area.",

This place is an absolute gem.  Inside is cozy and warm.  Great for dining with friends or for a romantic date.  I ordered the shrimp and spicy tomato sauce with black linguine.  The pasta is freshly made and squid ink used to dye the pasta.  It gives a nice subtle salty taste.  I also had a taste of the gnocchi dish that is carried on the menu and it was fabolous.  The texture was just right- not dry or overly chewy.  I could have eaten the whole plate.  We got the toll house pie and it was also amazing.  For two meals, dessert, one glass of wine, and a couple of beers our bill was under $50.  For the amount and quality of food, I felt it was a fantastic value. I will be back.",

My niece had purchased a Living Social promotion with a value of $50.  Our bill amounted to 58$ and some change.  When we presented it to our server he came back with it and said he could not honor it.  We asked to speak to the owner.  An older Italian woman with red hair came out and told us that because there were 4 of us at the table that we could not use the coupon.    She told us that we should read the fine print.  My niece tried to explain why we thought the coupon was valid, but the owner would not hear any of it.  She walked away yelling at us.  The real shame is that the food was good, but that owner is a nightmare.",

My server was SHOCKED and APPALLED that I was eating lunch alone, and he sat me in a narrow doorway (I banged my elbow into the wall twice because it was such a tight fit), even though there were a dozen other open tables. The mussels were overcooked. The panini had literally one see-through shaving of prosciutto (I had to pick up the bread to make sure it was there since I couldn't taste it) and it had limp lettuce pressed into the hot sandwich. Store-bought bread was brought cold to the table and was used in the panini. A huge disappointment considering all the other positive reviews.",

Dolce delivered as promised by all the other good reviews.  We all ordered specials.  Starting with the appetizer special.  I don't remember the name but it was thin layers of Italian meats, cheeses, olives etc between thin sheets of dough.  I've never had anything like it.  It delivered a great mix of flavor and adventure in every bite.    Next up, Lobster ravioli for me and and Osso Bucco for them.  Italian comfort food as they called it.  Everything was delicious.   To top it off we had espresso and  almond gelato which came as quite a generous portion and just the perfect hint of flavor to keep you reaching for another bite.    I was able to get 7:00 PM reservations at around noon of the same day but the place filled up fast after that so I do recommend reservations.",

No offer of a discount or to squeeze us into the back to make up for losing our reservation. They offered to sit us outside in the humid 95 degree weather. They were rude and should really be ashamed. I could tell the waitress looked apologetic but the owner could care less. Hope the food makes up for the horrific service but due to how we were treated and how hot it was outside we did not stick around to find out.",

Normal restaurants have 16-20 ounce fountain glasses with free refills for right around the same price.  Waiter seemed very anxious to clear our plates, although we still had 1/4 food left.

I have worked in service industry for years and never had an experience where obviously is was the businesses fault and they would not accept fault.he manager also said because we did not show the groupon when we sat down. She was such a coward that she could not even have an adult conversation with us. The food was mediocre, but because of how rude they treat their customers I will not be going back. How do they expect to create an environment where people want to become regulars by being so rude. What happened to the customer is always right?",

The person greeting us proceeded to tell us that they had just closed the patio, due to a holiday weekend so that the staff could leave early.  We were concerned about keeping people, so we were ready to leave, when she adamantly stated that we could still be served.  I specifically told her that we did not want to keep them from closing early.  She insisted, and so we were seated inside.  Halfway through our meal, which was approximately 30 minutes, servers were blowing out candles on surrounding empty tables, and a sense of urgency upon our server and assistants, to clear and move us along was extremely evident.  Our entire table consisted of restaurant management and service industry individuals, and this was extremely annoying to all of us.  We requested a manager, and he arrived at our table without an introduction.  He offered an apology, told us to stay as long as we wanted, and walked away.  Really???  Work on your attention to customer service Dolce.  You may pay an admirable amount of attention to your pasta, but you have a lot to work on when it comes to customer service.",

Our server recommended a great wine, based upon my liking and was more than happy to offer info re: the restaurant's \"Gnocchi Tuesday's\" that we'd read about online. Our server was accommodating & attentive. Now for the really good stuff - the food! The bread was served with a light tomato, olive oil, & cannelini bean salad. The caesar & spinach salads were both perfectly dressed. The pastas were fresh & the sauces were creamy & flavorful. We failed to leave room for dessert because we couldn't stop eating our pastas! We can't wait to go back for \"Gnocchi Tuesday\" & we will try dessert next time!",

    "text": "I love a great Italian restaurant, and I've been searching for a great one since I moved here to Charlotte.  I purchased a Groupon, and decided to hit this place up on a Wednesday night with my partner.  I really REALLY love food, and I really wanted to love this place.  I don't give many negative reviews, but I was so disappointed in this place.  First thing in the door, the hostess was not terribly welcoming.  Our server was a bit snobbish as well.  I realize that Dolce is a more expensive place for food, but I felt unwelcome wearing a nice pair of jeans and a nice sweater.   Also, the place was only half full, but it was really loud in there.  I could barely converse with the person sitting in front of me at our tiny table.  Our food was quite slow to arrive, and when it did, parts of it were only lukewarm.  I ordered a salmon special there, and my partner ordered the lobster ravioli special.  My fish was cooked well, but it was WAY too salty.  I had a zucchini casserole on the side, which was lukewarm.  Potato croquettes came with it, which were pretty different from others I've had, and they were pretty good.  My partner could not even taste any lobster in the ravioli, and the sauce was too salty as well.  Believe me, I LOVE salt, but it was barely palatable with so much on our dishes.  I think it might have been the sauces they used.  When dessert arrived, I ordered the tiramisu and my partner ordered the chocolate mousse thing (I can't remember the same, sadly).  The mousse was delicious and the texture was perfect.  The tiramisu was one of the best I'd ever had - a very strong coffee flavor infused throughout the whole dessert.  Dessert is the reason I don't give this place only one star.  When the bill came, our dinners were $16 for the ravioli (about 8 of them in the order, total) and $18 for the salmon, and $7 each for the desserts.  I'm so glad I had the Groupon and only had to pay half.  Another thing that really irked me was that they added an automatic 18% gratuity to our bill for using the Groupon.  I generally tip 20-25% on an order, as a general rule (I've worked in food service, so I try to be very generous).   I was pretty insulted that the restaurant assumed that I wouldn't pay a fair tip using the coupon, especially since it did not specify on the Groupon that we would be required to pay automatic gratuity.    Basically, what I have to say is that I'm glad we had the Groupon, because it would not have been worth the $60 total + tip we had to pay.  I really wanted to go back on a Tuesday to try their homemade gnocchi, but I don't think I'm willing to put up with bad service and inflated prices.  Surely there has to be a better Italian restaurant here in Charlotte.  My final word of advice: expensive does not necessarily mean quality, at least in this case.",

    "text": "I visited during Charlotte's Restaurant Week on Saturday, 1/30/2016 around 5:30 PM.   Let me tell you! The food here is DELICIOUS! I can tell it's homemade because some of it really tastes like I'm walking into some of the kitchen's of my Sicilian family members. The food is made with love.   As a starter, fresh bread is brought to the table. The bread is soft in the middle and crusty on the edges. The olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette were good. In the basket were also white beans, which I'm not a fan of.   For my appetizer, I had the Napoleon. It was a piece bruschetta style bread layered with fresh eggplant grilled to perfection, then a fresh slice of tomato underneath a hunky piece of mozzarella. It was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette reduction and goat cheese. The plate was adorned with a freshly hand-picked plump basil leaf! I devoured everything and wiped the plate clean!  Flavors were popping in my mouth! I love Napoleons and similar dishes wherever I go.. I was extremely pleased with Dolce's version and would EASILY come here again.. just for this dish! Excellent!  For my entree, I chose the Cannelloni, which is a basically a wrap type of noodle. You put the ingredients in it and roll it. This particular dish of cannelloni was filled or rather stuffed to capacity and overflowing with spinach, ricotta and mascarpone cheese. A small amount of creamy Parmigiano and a touch of tomato sauce was sprinkled on top. It was garnished with something I was unfamiliar with, but ate it anyways. This dish was delectable, however it was extremely heavy and rich. I only ate a third of it and had it boxed to go. I had another third of it later that evening and the remaining third the next morning for breakfast.   For dolce or dessert, I elected to enjoy the Limoncello Chiffon Cake! It was light and airy, yet still creamy. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. I also loved the strawberry sauce drizzled on the plate. It was the perfect ending to a hearty meal.  So why 4 stars and not 5? Service. The lady servers who brought the food and took the finished plates were great, but my server not so much. He never introduced himself after I was seated. He sulked when I asked for water and not wine/alcohol. He checked on me by asking questions when my mouth was full with my appetizer and then walked away. He didn't give me time to finish my appetizer before bringing the main dish. He didn't check on me throughout my meal after that. He didn't keep my water glass full. I had to flag him down to ask and he did a million things before telling someone else to fill my glass. I was completely parched from the deliciously, heavy cannelloni. I needed my glass filled again later, but didn't even bother and it wasn't replenished. While I was eating dessert, he apparently brought the check, which I didn't notice because I was still eating.. who brings the check when you're still eating? How did he know I didn't want anything else? The Napoleon was so good, that I had wanted to take one home, but I felt so rushed that I later forgot my intention. It was only when he randomly popped up to grab the check and payment, while I was still eating that I noticed it was placed there. At that point, I advised that I was not ready yet. I took my time with my dessert, I believe food is to be enjoyed not just scarfed down. I enjoyed every flavor in that cake. I still left him a tip that was slightly greater than 15%. Now, if the service was more on the mediocre side rather than subpar or if service had even came close to the quality, love, preparation and presentation of the food, then my experience at Dolce would have been: hands down 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.  Each restroom is only suited for one guest, either a lady or a gentleman. The ladies room was a pretty shade of a purplish pink, a nice mirror, flowered plant, and of course a working toilet and sink. The soap dispenser was full. It was clean and tidy.   It is important to note that parking in this mini-plaza can be a bit tricky. There were no spaces in the immediate parking lot and I ended up parking in the Harris Teeter parking lot, which is a very short walk away (think less than a city block.. you're still technically in the same overall parking lot).",

We got sat at a nice window table. Service was excellent through the whole night! We ordered the funghi appetizer and we were not disappointed! Mushrooms were huge and the stuffing was delicious! The sauce that was spread on the plate made even more amazing. I got the sarrento dish. It was fettuccini pasta with shrimp and spinach and sun dried tomatoes in a pink Alfredo sauce. There were large portions of shrimp. It was so good. It was my second time getting it and I will probably get it again. My fiance got the bolognese. Tasted good and fresh.  Sauce wasn't that heavy and it had just the right amount of meat. I ordered a Coke and they gave me a can with a glass of ice. We were surprised to see it was $2.50 just for that can of Coke! I thought the most would be $1.50. Other than that, we were pleased with our visit.",

Both of our dishes were $20 entrees but did not include salads, which we both found to be overpriced, and the shrimp was tiny.   The flavor for both was excellent as well as the portion sizes.  Our service was great and very attentive, including visits by the new owner to ensure our meal was up to par.  We finished our dinner with limoncello cake and two espressos, both of which were fantastic.  All in all the meal was good, a bit too pricey, and will probably stick with Portofino's going forward, but happy we tried a new restaurant.",

Honestly.. you are better off going to Carrabba's or some other chain... and will probably save at least $60.  Now I will admit.. I am a tiiiiiny bit biased after visiting Italy last summer :) However, Dolce was still anything but what I was expecting.   To start, we were greeted by a hostess who's mouth was stuffed full of food while she asked us if it was just us two... This took a minute, I could hardly understand her with the mouthful of salad she was talking through.  Dolce is a small, quaint little place - nothing fancy, but I have no complaints about the interior.   I'll jump right to the meal. I ordered the Gnocchi w/ Pesto. We came on a Tuesday because we heard this is the only night they serve fresh gnocchi. What a waste... I have made this dish at home and would prefer that over what I was served here any day. Not to mention.. after adding chicken to my entree... it was over $22. I dont think I would have paid $8 when it was all said and done. The chicken was the worst I have ever been served.. and the pesto - anything but fresh. The gnocchi itself was ok, but the meal altogether - meh.  My boyfriend ordered one of the veal options. served with a vegetable medley and some kind of rice pilaf. Usually we trade a fork-full of our meals with each other. I decided to decline to try his dish.. it looked anything but appetizing. His review was \"eh.. its alright I guess\"   We also each had one glass of wine each. Even after our $40 groupon was added, the meal cost us an additional $40 - INSANE!   This place is WAY overpriced and incredibly overrated. I would recommend any other Italian restaurant over this one. Safe to say, we won't be back.",

I keep buying LivingSocials when they have them so I can eat delicious, delicious gnocchi at a more reasonable price point. Having only ever eaten frozen gnocchi, I didn't even think I liked the stuff. After eating here, I definitely like it. A lot.   When they have it as a special, I entirely recommend the lobster gnocchi. It's pillowy gnocchi in parmesan cream sauce with nice, big lobster chunks, sun dried tomatoes, and spinach. After the bread and beans that come free (and sometimes sharing a burrata appetizer plate), I have trouble finishing the portion they serve. It makes a nice lunch the next day.   My dining companion tends to like Dolce's tomato sauce with chicken or their bolognese sauce on her gnocchi. Both have a rich complexity of flavor that makes me want to burn down a couple of chain Italian places so no one has to suffer their sweet, bland sauces ever again. So, don't make me commit arson by comparing this place to a big box, just make a reservation, swing by on a Tuesday (gnocchi!) night, and learn the truth.",

My closest Friends (everyone knows) and co-workers (even my Wife) says I'm difficult to read, thus not so easy to wait on... This Man did a Fantastic  Job!    On with the Food!  I know I'm weird!  First I order Water with no ice, seconds later Gelato as an appetizer... Here is where my Server began to show me he was paying close attention and started deciding how he would bring me what I wanted... Gelato : I could have Chocolate, Vanilla, BOTH or \"have you ever heard of Espresso Poured over a scoop of each\" (Actually my Wife ordered something similar when we were in Savannah just weeks ago) Sounds Good and it was!  Not sure if the Gelato was that good or if the Espresso Poured over it MADE it!  Glad I got it!  Great Appetizer!!!  Spaghetti Bolognese The Pasta tasted House-made (it was not) some of their Pasta is House made... The Sauce was good, not my favorite, still better than most Non Greek Italian!  Bread with (if you like)  Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar or (if you don't like) REAL Butter!  Tiramisu for Dessert (see the Photo) it was VERY Good!!!  All Service Staff were Polite, Friendly and Professional - Overheard them saying some kind words about some of the customers that had just left!",

It just has nice character in the dining room and the perfect lighting. They also have a big, enclosed patio if you'd like to sit outside.   They bring you complementary bread with white beans to start your meal. The food is always superb - you can tell it's fresh and homemade. Most recently we had the veal piccata - delicious as always.   We decided to split the house salad and a bottle of Pinot Grigio. They have a good selection of wines and you can definitely find something around $30, so not too expensive.   Sadly our server this recent trip was a major fail. Starting out with telling us their wine special \"tasted like crap\" - then joking that he wouldn't \"check on our table again\" if I made a special request for my entree. Really?! Unfortunately, he fulfilled that by not checking on us again or even bringing us water or refilling our wine. Yikes! Our food took FOR-EVER to come out, now I'm not sure if that was the waiter's fault of if the kitchen was way backed up. Either way, we were starving by the time dinner came out.   I hope this was a one-time occurrence because other than our service this time, I would still go back to Dolce for their delicious food.",

You're telling me this place isn't an elaborate prank on unsuspecting diners? Well dang. Then this might just be the single worst Italian dining experience from a local Italian restaurant I have ever had. From the service to the overpriced mediocre food to the atmosphere this place is a total and complete bust.   The server we had was completely unhelpful and literally wouldn't take our appetizer order until we ordered the entire meal because they were \"really busy and couldn't handle it.\" (Yes, really, a direct quote. Mind you that all the tables weren't even full and this was a Friday evening...so I don't even understand what would happen if you went on a less staffed night.) The food was horrible from the appetizer to the entree and we couldn't even stomach risking spending another penny on dessert because the entire meal was so blah. I don't know if it's policy or not at this restaurant but my water was brought out and never once filled again, and looking around at the other tables this was the case for them as well.   The inside is a weird combination of decorations and the outside patio sits right in the middle of a parking lot...no ambiance in either location.   I could probably go on and on and on about how horrible this place is but the bottom line is this: avoid at all costs. Hell, go buy a bottle of Ragu at the next door Harris Teeter and save yourself the money and agony of dining at this establishment. I can assure you you wouldn't notice the difference.",

Our family has been loyal. We will miss Ken. He is awesome. We adored Petra and Carlos. Your daughter is rude and sucked at waiting tables because she has NO people skills and she sucks at managing.   Since the day you opened as Dolce and not Dolce and Gelato we have ordered our children a side of pasta. Didn't know a \"kid's pasta\" existed. We have been charged $3. Last night when I was charged $7 for 25 penne noodles and a \"kid's pasta\" I said to the waitress \"I ordered 2 sides of pasta.\"   Your daughter then proceeds to come outside and tell me \"someone has been doing me favors and she is going to fix this problem and I should never have been getting $3 side pastas for the kids.\" Excuse me. Favors? For my loyalty for 10+ years you accuse me of somehow stealing from you with \"someone doing me favors.\"   Can you read your own menu that says a side of pasta with an entree is $3?  20 noodles with butter is not worth $7. Ask 300 East, a kid's pasta is larger AND cheaper.  Ken, we will miss you. Petra, if you ever head back from Raleigh with your beautiful daughter come see us.  Hayley, good luck in school!  Luisa, fire your daughter. She sucks. She always has. She just lost you a very loyal customer because in spite of \"someone doing me favors\" it was the other way around. I did you a favor by being a loyal patron and allowing your restaurant to be such an integral part of our lives.  And, I recommend your daughter go work at Chick-fil-A, like I did starting at 12. They can teach her how to treat a customer.  Luisa, wake up. Your daughter sucks at people skills. She is rude and couldn't wait a table. Put her in the kitchen so she doesn't ever have to see a patron or interact with anyone and tell her to throw in a few more noodles for $7.  And, then I will do you a favor and consider stepping foot back in your restaurant again. On second thought, no I won't.   Maybe the reason why you always have to be on living social or groupon is her and her \"management.\"  Sincerely, Your once Loyal Customer",

The Stuffed mushroom appetizer was the best I have ever put in my mouth! I could have eaten a dozen of them by myself! Then we opted for the pasta with Amatraciana sauce. The pasta was cooked perfectly and tasted like it was made in house. The sauce was heavenly! The perfect balance of creamy tomato sauce, salty pancetta, savory herbs and just the right amount of heat! I lived in Sicily for 2 years during my time in the Navy and this was without a doubt the best, most authentic Italian food I have had in the United States!

    "text": "I'd eaten at Dolce 3-4 years ago and found it mediocre.  Some friends had recently gone and enjoyed themselves and I really wanted to like the restaurant.  To some degree I was successful.  Here are some pro's and con's.  Pros: 1) The waiters were friendly and helpful.   2)  The wine list is a good size and reasonably priced.  My waiter knew the list well and could make intelligent and helpful recommendations.  3)  Even though it's in a strip mall, I enjoyed the outdoor seating; I just pretended that the parking lot was a beach on the Riveria.  4)  The beans/tomatoes that came with the bread were outstanding.  Fresh and good tomatoes along with a good prep made for an enjoyable introduction.  the olive oil in which to dip one's bread was of good quality.  5)  The mista salad had really good cherry tomatoes and, yes, tasty cucumbers.  Cons (or near cons):  1)  The greeting staff met me with a frown and the question \"What can I get you?\"  Well, maybe dinner.  How about \"Welcome to Dolce.\" etc. along with a smile.  2)  The bread was ordinary (not much flavor and not overwhelmingly fresh).    3)  My mista salad was a bit limp. The \"balsamic dressing\" consisted of a bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.    4)  My veal (saltimbucca) , well, was OK, but nothing to write home about.  It was beaten successfully into tenderness, but the proscuitto was sparse, soft, and soaked in a wine sauce. It didn't taste like parma.  The vegetable side didn't do much for me; it sorta just sat there and said \"I'm ordinary over-cooked vegetables -- but not bad.\"  5)  Some of the desserts are made in house and some are purchased.  I was full and didn't try them so no comment here.  6)  For reasons beyond me the dinner menu on their attractive website reads \"09 fall/winter.\"  It's still about the same menu as 3 years ago, but I think the web site's alternating attractiveness and huh?-ness reflects the rest of my dining experience.  As chef Rocco DiSpirito replied in his old TV show \"The Restaurant\" to someone who wasn't wild about his food: \"It's fun food, not fine food.\"   Same here.  Go with limited expectations and you'll have a delightful time.  P.S. a note to reviewer  Kathleen T (7/13/10) who went to lunch alone and felt that the servers were shocked that she was there alone and was stuck at a bad table.  I went to dinner by myself and was greeted by three staff in a row who began with \"Is it just you?\"  I did get a good table (sorry Kathleen), but wished they had started with a \"Will you be joining us for dinner tonight?  Are there more in your party?\" or something like that.  It wasn't a big thing, but it's so easy to fix.",

    "text": "Ok so I have to preface this review by saying that we didn't end up eating here.  My husband and I were looking for a place to eat and looked at Groupon to get some ideas and see if there were any deals nearby at the moment.  We saw Dolce which was a pretty close drive for us from Uptown, had never been so decided to give it a try.  We purchased the Groupon and headed to Dolce.  When we got there, they seemed a little disorganized.  After we finally got seated, we got our drinks and looked over the menu and decided our orders.  Waiter came back, and we told him our order and also mentioned that we have the Groupon.  He immediately asked if we bought it that day or a different day.  We told him we bought it today.  He said he didn't think the owner would accept it since we bought it that same day.  (this is not a Groupon rule and is not mentioned anywhere on the Groupon).  We showed him the voucher and told him there is no rule on using it the same day and he said he knew that but it was the owner who wouldn't allow it.  He went to go ask her and came back confirming we couldn't use it and was very sorry because there was no telling an old Italian lady how these things work.  That was funny.  Anyways, we decided if they weren't going to be honorable with the Groupon that we didn't want to eat there so needless to say we left and had Groupon refund the cost.  The Groupon rep confirmed that it should have been allowed to use the same day and promptly refunded.  This lady is pretty dumb though, because having a customer buy and use the same day means they truly got measurable value out of the marketing on Groupon as that was the reason we were even there vs. someone buying and keeping in their back pocket for a future date when they may need to go out to dinner on a discount.  Whatevs, if they didn't want our business that day, we won't be returning any other day either!",

The menu said it came with the starch of the day and vegetable of the day. So I got eggplant with tomato sauce and...mashed potatoes? Really? who does that? When I inquired about it I was told we are a NORTHERN Italian rsetaurant...condescending ( and, yeah, I've been to Northern Italy and know the difference). I was then told they were \"Parmesan Whipped Potatoes\" ...I tasted them.... pretty much mashed potato witout a hint of parmesan.  I was told I could get a side of spaghetti for $3. It can't cost more than 50 cents to make that.....almost $20 for that meal is not a good value. To be fair my wife had a salmon dish that was more generous and very good.",

It's not as big as Mama Ricotta's, but it's just as packed usually, so you'll have to get a reservation or eat at an early hour (especially if it's a Friday or Saturday night). There always seem to be birthday dinners going on here (usually people in their twenties or early thirties), which I think bodes well for any restaurant. Definitely popular with young professional types, but lots of families there, too--although i would hesitate to call it a family restaurant. Little too classy, little pricy for that denotation.   But like I said, it's great. Try to pasta alla vodka; definitely my favorite. And drink the wine--it's all really good.",

We were seated in the back room which overlooks Kenilworth Dr.  The decor of the room is interesting with wreaths and masks hung on the walls. I'd never expect that in an Italian place.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Bruschetta.  The topings were fresh and very tasty.   For a meal, I ordered the tilapia which was a good portion.  Each meal comes with a starch and veggie of the day.  The veggie was assorted squash and the starch was mashed potatoes.  The veggies were good and tender in a light sauce.  The tilapia came also with a white wine sauce.     The highlight of this meal was dessert.  I had the tiramisu and one of my friends had the lemon sponge cake which I was able to sample.  Both were very light and lightly sweet.  Probably some of the best tiramisu I've had.    The two flaws here were when we came in, we were asked if we had a reservation and we did not and the owner said \"Please wait until I figure out what to do with you\".  Wow.  There was no line, there were plenty of tables, especially outside and I just thought that comment was kind of rude.    The other flaw is that we had to ask for bread after our meals arrived.  This should have arrived prior to the meal but our waiter forgot.  Not a biggie.  Things like this happen sometimes.",

I only got the sorrento pasta and the clam pasta (I can't remember the name of it, but it was clams and linguini in a white wine butter sauce with parsley). Both were my favorite pasta dishes I've had in a long time. Not only is it a good price for the plate, it was more than delicious.  Save room for dessert, the tiramisu was the best thing I've ever had. I didn't like tiramisu before this one and it was the most light and fluffy and NOT BITTER AT ALL tiramisu ever. 15/10 would recommend.",

    "text": "I'm not sure how this restaurant has such high ratings. Tried it last week because of a Living Social deal. I got the ravioli with chicken; girlfriend got the spaghetti with shrimp. I couldn't finish my meal because it was so insanely salty. I went through five glasses of water trying to choke down the food, and in the end I had to just stop even though I was still hungry. I tried the spaghetti, and it was just as salty. When I told the waiter to bring extra water because the food is way too salty, he responded with, \"I knoooow,\" so I don't think this was news to him.    Some other peculiarities:   - The decor is beyond awful. It feels like you are sitting in a thrift shop with tables.   - No beer or cocktails. Just wine.   - The menu is very limited.   - Really odd: The entree list (as opposed to the pasta list) says, \"All entrees are served with the starch of the day.\" I asked about the milanese, which is a very thin, breaded piece of chicken. It doesn't come with a starch (risotto that day) because it comes with lettuce instead. So for $23, you get a thin piece of chicken and some lettuce. What the..   - Even though I was clearly trying to complain to the waiter that the food was almost inedible, there was no hint that anything was going to be done about it. He could not have cared less.    I'm sorry to dump on a restaurant this harshly, but really, the food is just garbage, and the prices they charge are obscene considering all of the terrible factors. If you want to charge $20 for a plate of noodles, you need to be much better than a Walmart atmosphere with salt standing in for flavor.",

Upon being seated, a bread basket with bean salad is presented and is the only consistently disappointing  part of the experience. For an Italian restaurant, we have expectations of fresh, warm, crusty bread and theirs is definitely the opposite in every way.  Besides the bread, everything else is always wonderful. For a small restaurant, they have a delightful Italian wine selection to compliment their dishes. The vodka sauce is the best in Charlotte--ask if they have any fresh pastas available to pair it with, typically they have something in the back. Gnocchi night is also impressive, with fluffy and delicate gnocchi accompanied by delicious sauces and proteins that are typically aligned to the seasons.   We highly recommend this spot, but wouldn't consider it the best Italian in the area for a date or special occasion--just a tasty staple that is well-priced!",

The things that disheartened me was that the seafood appetizer was inconsistently cooked with the calamari being chewy and overcooked while their was an undercooked mussel, and things that were described as \"spicy\" had no spice at all. The boar pasta tasted bland, the gnnochi was underseasoned, and the ravioli was suposed to be in a wine sauce but it was served in the same identical tomato cream sauce on the gnnochi and under the stuffed mushrooms. All three of these items spoke of different sauces! I couldn't relay any of my critiques to my server as she barely visted our table and kept trying to hurry us along. I was even frustrated that ordering regular filtered water was going to cost me 5 dollars a glass so we drank the unfiltered tap water. They tried to make tap water seem fancy by serving it in a glass bottle. Our table probably went through 5 baskets of bread before our mains came out of the kitchen and the wait staff was so annoyed every time we requested more bread. I spent 50 dollars on this queens feast meal hoping to have an amazing meal because the gentleman greeting us was so charming but was very underwelmed. Our table was so close to another table if I got up I was afraid my body would hit their food and no privacy for our conversations amongst my friends. I hate to say this but honestly I would have paid half this at olive garden and probably eaten better at this point. Also thinking back to my recent experience at Texas Roadhouse or Olive Garden they never got annoyed at us for requesting more rolls/bread when food was taking a long time in the kitchen. Literally the only thing we could say we loved was our desserts.",

    "text": "My husband and I had to try Dolce again under its new ownership.  I'm happy to say that the new owners have addressed the prior issues we had with Dolce (i.e., limited menu, high prices, terrible music) which had prevented us from coming more frequently.  Even better, the food--which was never a complaint before--is just as good.  We started with the burrata.  The new version has prosciutto, and is a larger portion than previously, at a lower price.  Yay!  I never could stomach paying $16 for the prior version.  And this new version is just delicious.    For our entrees, I had the linguini a la genovese, a light pesto sauce with shrimp.  I liked that the pasta wasn't over-sauced, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.  The portion was large enough I could bring home leftovers, too.  My husband had the scogliera, a linguini dish with shrimp, clams, mussels, and calamari.  The sauce was not really very spicy, but it was extremely flavorful, and my husband said he'd absolutely get this dish again.  Maybe only one concern was that there didn't appear to be enough wait staff.  And they were extremely busy.  Maybe that's something the new owners can address as they see a continued full house.  We returned a few months later, and my husband had their penne a la vodka with shrimp.  It was as good as their version under the previous ownership.  I again had the linguini a la genovese.  Of the two, I think the penne a la vodka is slightly better.  The sauce is just so deliciously rich and creamy.  They also had more wait staff, and service was fantastic.  When we were leaving, the owner warmly asked how we enjoyed our meal.  He told us of exciting renovations he is making to the interior, such as wood floors and ceiling.  Everything should be done by 12/6.  We can't wait to return!",

This allowed us a leisurely visit with our friends with perfectly prepared and served food.   We couldn't have asked for better food or service. The appetizer was prosciutto and burato, tasty and fun to share. Two of us split the recommended amatriciana. It had great taste and just the right amount of heat. My dessert was vanilla gelato with fresh espresso. A really neat dessert to finish off our perfect meal.",

    "text": "Had there not been a few little glitches this should get 5 stars.  Three of us dined at 7:30 on a Friday night.  We were let to our table by an owner, given no menus, and ignored for 15 minutes.  Servers rushed by and successfully avoided looking our way.  Finally a nice server came by and apologized, saying something about not having designated stations. He asked who seated us and evidently discussed it with the owner.  After that, we had attention from the server and the owner and we thought they redeemed themselves satisfactorily.  My Sorrento pasta was DELICIOUS.  The pasta was freshly made that week and the sauce was so good. One of my companions had the Gnocchi special of the night and she raved about it. The other companion had the salmon and opted for broccolini I to go with it.  They were out of broccolini so she got broccoli  instead. She said that everything was very good.  When the food was delivered by someone else, no shredded Parmesan was offered. We waited and didn't see anyone to call over.  When the owner came to check on us, I asked abut the cheese and he, in fun, yelled at our server that we was fired. The cheese came.  The menu had a Limoncello martini listed.  I asked for just a Limoncello.  They were out. Evidently, a group had shots and they didn't expect more until Monday.  The restaurant doesn't make its own.  The owner and the server treated us to a dessert to share (Limoncello cake) which was very, very good. Also, we were treated to glasses of Amaretto.  Mistakes were handled well, the food is delicious, the owners and employees are nice. I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "We decided to try this spot on the famous gnocchi Tuesday, and wow we were glad we did!  Our server was attentive, kind, and helpful. This definitely helped enhance our experience.   Good wine selection. No draft which is a tad disappointing, but expected.   The meal began with bread and a cannelloni dip. We enjoyed the bean idea, but it wasn't well executed as others have mentioned. The beans were cold, as was the bread. If this has been a common complaint for them, I am surprised they don't change to a better bread that is warm with olive oil and spices or butter.  I think they could still do the bean dip, but they definitely need better bread. Everyone wants warm bread at an Italian place!  We asked our waiter where the bread came from, and he told us it was from Nova's bakery. I like it's local, but please serve it warm.  Dinner completely turned everything around. Our dishes were excellent! We got the seafood pasta (frutti di mare) and the lobster gnocchi special. Holy cow the gnocchi. Among some of the best I've ever had. I understand now why they only do it one night a week because you can tell it is made fresh. There was a decent amount of lobster in the dish and it was in a pink, cream sauce. Both portions were huge, which made me feel better about the prices. The seafood pasta was nice as well. The seafood was cooked as it should be, and the spicy sauce was different and a nice touch.  We used a groupon, and I feel as though it was a great deal. I think now I may buy some more, so we can come back! Gnocchi Tuesday is the way to go. I think I might only go on Tuesdays haha because I have a feeling their gnocchi is the best thing on the menu.",

We were greeted by the most friendly and competent staff of servers...a couple were related to the Owner..(daughter and son ). We sat down and Joanne brought us our menu's and some bread and a white bean relish. This was my choice. I went with the Prosciutto and Burrata Appetizer, Then the Veal with Artichoke and Lemon, and then the Torta Chocolatina.

And wow what a gem! Our server was amazing! I was dd, but the bf ordered a red blend for $8.5 while we munched on the awesome, complimentary cannelloni bean and bread app. I seriously could eat this bean app by itself without anything. We ordered the Serrento a little pricey at $23 as well as the 4 cheese gnocchi dish, $18, but, it is handmade every Tuesday. The food didn't take too long and I was so glad because it was awesome. The pink Alfredo had quite the bite! The shrimp in this dish was cooked to perfection. I did notice that the 4 cheese sauce was extremely Gorgonzola heavy, I could only eat a couple of gnocchi pieces at a time. The gnocchi though. woah, so fluffy and airy. I casually mentioned this to our server, and he gave us some great tips for next time. Go with a lighter sauce like pesto or tomato, gnocchi is already decadent.   We will definitely be back for more. Everything was great!",

    "text": "This place is terrible.  Word to the wise: the reason this restaurant always has a LivingSocial deal available (literally always) is because they need to entice new diners to take a chance on eating there, because they know they won't be returning.  The meal started with bread.  Cold, dry, somewhat stale bread, accompanied by a tiny cannellini bean salad.  Bread was terrible, bean salad was okay.  Despite its inferior quality, we saved most of the bread because we had the white wine mussels appetizer coming.  Let's be real.  No one orders the white wine mussels for the mussels.  Are they tasty?  Sure.  But we all know you order the white wine mussels for the white wine sauce they come in, so you can somewhat disguise your gluttony by saturating the complimentary bread with it rather than drink the sauce straight from the vessel.  That's just how it is.  Unfortunately, the mussels came in what must have been 2-3 tablespoons of sauce.  That's it.  It was actually pretty tasty, but there was so little of it that it imparted literally zero flavor into the mussels themselves and we even had leftover bread after wiping the bowl dry of the wine sauce.  Now on to the mussels themselves: don't get these.  When removing them from the shell, I've never encountered mussels that have so consistently had a small piece of shell break off still attached to the meat.  I didn't notice on the first one and got a nice crunchy mouthful of calcium carbonate.  Almost every one after that, I had to pluck pieces of broken shell from the meat before eating.  My wife and I ordered caesar salads before our mains.  What came out had romaine lettuce, dressed in caesar dressing with parmigano of dubious quality sprinkled over it, and also...tomatoes?  And hard boiled egg quarters?  I've never seen that before on a caesar salad.  Wholly unnecessary.  Oh, by the way, when our server offered a salad to accompany our entrees, he didn't mention that they'd both be the full price of $8 each.  For an utterly mediocre salad that wasn't even very large.  Ripoff.  For our main course, I got the bolognese and she got the penne vodka.  When I think of a bolognese, I think of a meaty, rich sauce clinging to each piece of pasta.  What I got was reminiscent of watery ground beef.  It also had a bit of a sweet off-taste that neither of us were fond of.  At least her penne vodka was decent, since it's pretty hard to screw that up.  As far as the food goes...  Bread 1/5 Mussels 1/5 Salad 1/5 Main course 2/5 (simply for the penne vodka)  Service?  Service was decent.  Our server was actually quite pleasant.  The only issue there was that we may as well have had an additional appetizer and entree of cigarette smoke.  He absolutely reeked of it and that does not do wonders for the appetite.  This place is a sham.  Don't be fooled.  There is nothing of value here.",

    "text": "For me, Dolce was a mixed bag.   On the plus side, the food is REALLY goddamn good and quite authentic. I was in Italy a month ago and the food here was as good. Let me break it down for you...  Burrata and prosciutto starter ($12.50) - order this. The burrata is creamy wonderful deliciousness and the prosciutto paired perfectly. Spread it all on authentic Tuscan bread (served with a small ramekin of bean salad). You could make a light dinner of this plate if you wanted to.  My carbonara ($17.95) was damn good too - creamy and full of pecorino tastiness. My BIL loved his amitriciana bucatini pasta as well.   I also liked that the space was fresh and clean - it appears to be newly remodeled. There's a big covered patio too - smoking is allowed out there which can be a plus or minus depending on your proclivities.   Now....on to the downsides. When we visited, they were pretty dead but our service was inattentive. You could argue, probably correctly, that this is truly Italian service where they don't bother you. So plan to spend some time.   Finally - they had a food prep station at the first table inside the door. That sat, unused, with a big bowl of ravioli filling and fresh pasta sheets....for at least 2 hours, unrefrigerated and uncovered. Literally in the dining room where any random could touch or cough on it. Not okay. Especially considering during that time 1/2 the kitchen staff was sitting in the patio smoking like chimneys. Like guys, just don't let me see all this ok?   This place is authentic on many levels - you decide if it's right for you. I'd go back because the food really was awesome but I'd say hell no to the ravioli!",

    "text": "I pride myself on giving fair reviews, based on what I experience.  Because I eat out almost every day, I have a keen sense of what is good and what is not. Today was NOT good at Dolce. I was part of a large group that was seated at 11:30 a.m. At 12:15 we still didn't have drinks. In fact, we had been there for awhile and there were no menus on the tables. We had to ask for menus and the server told us they didn't have enough of them.  Then, after being there for 45 minutes without an offer of beverages, I called the restaurant from my cell phone to tell them that we needed drinks in the back room. The manager was clearly not happy and the server leaned over the counter and said, \"I am inputting your lunch orders. Would you rather me get your food to you or get your drinks?\" It was said with an enormous amount of attitude and arrogance.  My response back to her was that it is normally expected that drink orders are taken and delivered before the food arrives. Well, things only  went downhill from there. There were people who wanted coffee. The manager came out and explained that they had run out of coffee.  There was a Harris Teeter right next to this restaurant. Why did he not send someone out for coffee?  DUH!   The server explained that they had served a few people coffee and had to use their last little bit for refills for them.   WHAT????   The food orders arrived an hour and a half into our time there.  Although we had a large group, every restaurant that we go to each month is efficient and always amazes me at how they handle our large group. Today was different.   We were out of drink. We were out of bread. Some of us were without a menu.  Needless to say, it took me forever to get my check, when I alerted them to the fact that I had an appointment and had to leave.  On top of all of this, the salad with chicken on it that I ordered was very average. There was nothing special or unique about it. Sometimes outstanding food  can make up some for miserable service. Not today.  The person next to me ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce. She complained that the pasta was sticky and the sauce was way too sweet.   It was not a good experience and I would hesitate to recommend this restaurant.  By the way, our group notified this restaurant a day ahead of time of the number of people who would be coming today. They should have been prepared. They were not only not prepared, they had a sour attitude that makes me wonder how they stay in business.  Sorry, but this is what I experienced today and this is a fair review.   Very disappointed.",

    "text": "Draw a line through reviews from 2016 and back.  They don't matter anymore.  Why?  The new owners are crushing it.  From the new decor to the warm welcome we felt right at home (well, if I lived in Rome).  We began with a complimentary cannolloni bean and bread plate.  Soft and expertly seasoned, the beans enhanced the rustic bread with its crunchy crust.  Wonderful start.  The Funghi appetizer we selected are button mushrooms stuffed with spinach and cream cheese served in a cognac cream sauce.  The combination of el dente mushrooms, the slight ooze of the cream cheese, and the richness of the sauce coalesced into a memorable first course.  Lori ordered the ravioli stuffed with seafood.  Cooked perfectly it was the star entree of the evening for our party.  My plate of pappardelle with a wild boar ragu held its own, but after tasting the ravioli I regretted my decision.  Nothing was amiss . . . but, that ravioli.  Mmm.  I guess you'll have to try it for yourself.  We received excellent service but we had to request a waitress after being seated for some time.  Once we ordered, and because it was restaurant week with the kitchen focused on an abbreviated menu, we felt the plates came out too fast.    Somewhere in between these extremes lurks their fifth star.  I'll return to help them find it, too.  In the meantime, a hearty \"Give 'em a whirl\" from me.",

Generally, I steer away from Restaurant Week spots but friends convinced me that early reservations would be ok. Glad I agreed. We were even seated a few minutes ahead of our reserved time. Hint: Dolce only serves their Restaurant Week menu during this time which made the flow of dinner super fast. And it helped my pocketbook because I rarely stick to the abbreviated menu but this method made sure that I did.   We were greeted warmly and everyone was your server...a True Italian-family method.   I started with the guazzetto as my appetizer. There was an ample supply of calamari rings (I prefer the rings) and mussels were plentiful. One lone large shrimp rounded out the dish that was served in a nice white wine sauce and topped with a triangle of crostini bread.   For my entree, I chose the ravioli. Homemade, of course, the ravioli was stuffed with shrimp and crab in a Pinot Grigio aurora sauce. If you're not a fan of hearty red sauces, this is the way to go. The sauce was very creamy and rich.   For dessert, I chose the tiramisu. It was very good and has just the right hint of coffee that was not overpowering like some can be.   Everything from the food, service and ambiance were great. The only disappointment for me was the wine selection. To be an Italian restaurant, the choices seemed limited.",

We live nearby.  Food is pretty decent, certain dishes better than others (lasagna is very good!).   But it now closes so early and we've wasted so much time walking there just to find it closed for no good reason other than staff wants to get off early.  I miss the magic we had at this place and hope it either changes its hours on its website to close at 8 or 830 or stays open as advertised because it's just very disappointing.  We went to another nearby Italian restaurant instead which was full tonight.",

We were so happy when we found a really good Italian restaurant, especially with such a sweet owner like Louisa. We eat in Manhattan almost every week and I can say that Louisa's food is comparable to any of the really good restaurants in New York. We particularly like fungi as an appetizer,amatriciana with bucatini, incredible gnocchi on Tuesday, chicken franchese, and veal marsala. Deserts are very good, especially the lemon cheese cake and the gelato. We go to the Carolina's about seven times a year and always make a stop at Dolce.",

    "text": "I went in on a Tuesday night, the only night Dolce makes their gnocchi due to the \"intense labor\" they said that goes into making it.  I started with the spinach salad that only had sparse appointments of the roasted beets, bacon, goat cheese, and pistachios.  The balsamic vinaigrette was far too syrupy sweet.  Onto the highly anticipated gnocchi......expecting a culinary delight, I was greatly disappointed with the quality - too soft and over cooked.  With a variety of sauces to choose from, I chose the bolognese sauce, again with disappointing results.  Expecting a rich, hearty, slow braised meat, veal & pork and vegetable sauce, typical of a bolognese sauce, theirs was sparse with meat and lacked any resemblance of vegetables.  It was more like a vodka cream sauce.  This was the third of three gnocchi dishes I had in Charlotte over the past 10 days and by far the worst of the three.   Since I dined alone to use my soon to expire dining coupon and they would not let me take any item home, I also ordered the Solgiola, a dish described as a \"rolled filet filled with lobster, shrimp & crab meat and baked & served with a creamy cognac sauce.\"  It came out slightly overcooked with a fishy taste, again causing concerns of quality.  The creamy cognac sauce looked very similar to the bolognese sauce except that it lacked the sparse bits of meat.  The lobster, shrimp & crab meat was minced together into an unrecognizable form, far from my expectations of chunks and lumps of fresh seafood bursting from a flaky and delicate flounder filet.  Served with it was a unimaginative and flavorless medley of green & yellow squash and a dollop of bland risotto, that appeared to be placed there to fill up excess space on the plate.  At the recommendation of the server, I ordered the chocolate mousse.  The presentation was an awesome display of a fluffy tower of formed mousse, a thin, horizontal chocolate layer that created a landing zone for the whipped cream dollop and a wedge of a wafer cookie.  What it offered in presentation, it lacked in flavor.  My dining experience was quite disappointing with the flavors far underachieving their full potential.  The only saving grace was that I used a dining coupon and avoided paying full price.  The one star was given only for the presentation of the chocolate mousse.",

Since I am not local to Charlotte I did my homework through Yelp, as I always do, and found all the comments about Gnocchi Tuesdays, so i was ready. First, the overall atmosphere of Dolce is very nice, it definitely has that family restaurant feel to it, which I always enjoy. Our waiter was very patient, pleasant, and informative so another plus. I had planned to order the gnocchi as an entree, but the group wanted to try it as an appetizer, so we did that. there are four sauces choices and ours was the four cheese sauce. For the entree I chose the penne pasta in a vodka sauce. The gnocchi was wonderful - tender and very tasty. I wanted more and wished that I had went ahead and ordered my own portion. The penne was very good, but the memory of the gnocchi still was a distraction. We took out time with the meal and conversation and watched the restaurant fill up and when we left it was completely full. Another very nice evening and meal in Charlotte.",

    "text": "We were very disappointed.  We have been here 2-3 times in the past and have had good experiences.  My husband loves good gnocchi.  The first time we went here it was on a Tuesday so we could try the gnocchi because we had heard how delicious it was. We don't get to go regularly on Tuesdays because of our work schedules.  When I saw they were offering the gnocchi on their restaurant week menu, I immediately made reservations to go on a Friday night.  When we arrived we were led to the back dining area.  The main dining room was only about half filled (it was a 6:30 reservation) and there were 5-6 other tables with parties of 2 in the main dining room sitting at nice two-tops, four-tops and two women sitting at a six-top.  We were seated at a table in the back dining area, which was not a big deal until we sat down and realized it was an outside/patio table they had brought inside and put a tablecloth on.  It was extremely light so everytime you moved, put your elbow on the table or moved something on the table, the whole table moved/shifted.  The chairs were regular chairs for the dining tables so they didn't move all the way up to the table.  Plus the table was about 3 inches shorter than a regular dining table.  We felt like we were sitting at the kids table on Thanksgiving Day. We ordered our drinks and then I went to the restroom.  The ladies room was occupied so I waited 2-3 minutes and then watched as a male employee exited the ladies room.  We didn't want to order the restaurant week \"3 courses for $30\" but my husband did want gnocchi since they were offering it on a night other than Tuesday.  When we asked about ordering it and just paying the regular Tuesday night price our server told us he would have to check, that he had already been yelled at for substituting a sauce on someone elses order.  Other than that the service was okay.  We ended up ordering the shrimp scampi and the chicken rolletini dish.  Both were bland and not good.  We won't go here again.  Shouldn't the service and food be BETTER on a restaurant week night, when people are likely to try new places? Too bad.",

    "text": "I actually just left the restaurant. Me and three of my friends all went to the restaurant for the first time. It was tiny and very cramped. I actually got elbowed in the head twice by servers. It was also extremely loud! I ordered a ceasar salad. I get the bill and its 16.95 for a salad and water!!! The menu specifically says 6.95. But somehow I'm getting charged 10 dollars extra! So I bring it up and ask why I'm getting charged so much. Apparently I got served a \"DINNER\" salad even though I ordered a regular salad. I told the server this as well as an older lady, short, redish curly hair, accent, very rude that I was over charged. The server failed to ask and tell me that I was getting a dinner portion even though the menu says NOWHERE that that it what you will get no matter what. The older lady told me that its dinner time so that is what I get. I went on to tell her that that is not what I ordered and that the menu says ceasar salad 6.95. She began talking in circles saying everything over and over again. She blamed everything on the server who was nice just failed to tell me. She also told me that it was my fault because I ate the salad. Yes, really. She told me it was my fault. She said that I did not complain so it's my problem. She also said \"You know what, your right mammi. It is my fault because this is not McDonald's and that is where you should be eating.\" Yep. She actually said that to a customer. I told the waiter that it was not his fault and told her that I would never be eating there again. I never will. I ended up paying 20 dollars for a salad, and to be honest, not a very good one. I'm still fuming at the fact that someone actually said that to me. It's not about the money, it's about what I ordered and what I was sneakily being charged for and when I asked about it I got yelled at. Classy",

This place is good but there are many other Italian restaurants in Charlotte that are just as good if not better and not so pricey. In my opinion this place is WAY overpriced.  Come on folks pasta is about a buck fifty a pound so when you charge over $16 for pasta and sauce and another $3-5 to add a meat to the dish  it's just a little ridiculous.",

My shrimp and pasta entree felt more like Applebee's than an $18 plate. The taste was okay and portions were super-sized, but there was no nuance and it just wasn't that great. My partner's was equally bleh. Not terrible food, just ridiculously overpriced. And oh, goodness gracious, the Celine-Dion-esque Italian music was cheesier than the pasta sauce.",

The beans they serve to go with their bread are delicious - I eat them plain, even when the bread is gone!

However, we were a little disappointed on our last trip.  We went with another couple. We had a Living Social Deal & they had a groupon.  We asked if we could be treated as 2 separate tables since we were going to have 2 different bills and that way we could both use or vouchers.  I completely understand the reason why you would want to limit the number of vouchers used, but if we are acting/paying/ordering as 2 separate tables I don't understand why they wouldn't let us use both.  As I mentioned, Dolce is one of our favorite restaurants and we've been there many times. It would have been nice if they had been a little flexible (perhaps saying they would allow it this once and wouldn't allow it again).  But they didn't and it made me feel like they don't value loyal customers.",

The restaurant only offers this menu item on Tuesdays due to the intense labor of hand-making the pasta, and offers five sauces (one of which is a wildcard) to accompany it.  The pasta is melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious and the four-cheese sauce that I can never resist is the perfect compliment.  My wife has had the vodka sauce and meat sauce on different occasions, and was very satisfied with both.  Stepping off my ivory gnocchi tower, the restaurant scores well in other categories as well.  The service is friendly, attentive, and speedy; the location offers plenty of indoor and outdoor seating; delicious bread is served as a warm-up; the wine list is expensive; and the menu is not over-priced.  They offer a nice array of desserts if you haven't stuffed yourself too full of pasta - we ordered the tiramisu both times and loved it.  If you've never been before, go on a Tuesday and don't stray from the gnocchi - I promise you won't be dissapointed.",

Hubby and I went thanks to a groupon that I had recently purchased and after many weeks of wanting to try it out.  But they are closed on Sundays - argh!  After reading some of the helpful reviews about Tuesday's gnocchi, we decided to get our gnocchi on.   This place is full of awesome ambiance.  It's not SUPER fancy, but there were lots of people on more low key dates.  And even then, I still felt welcomed in my scrubs and without reservations.  It's definitely got a romantic atmosphere, but without being super pricey.  Maybe it was the lighting or the decor.  Whatever it was, I loved it!  Our server was basic.  Not the most amazing one ever, but appropriately attentive.  We started with the caprese app which was PERFECT!  Or maybe I've just been in mozzarella withdrawal.  Hubby and I both ended up getting the gnocchi as well, mine with the 4 cheese sauce and his with the pesto.  As others have said, the 4 cheese was a bit heavy, but that didn't stop me from finishing it!  The gnocchi was pretty damn fabulous.  Not quite as good as what I've had in Boston's North End, but the best I've had outside of it.  And the menu was extensive, so I know we'll be back to try some more.  Plus, prices were definitely reasonable.  We did get tiramisu for dessert.  It was solid, but not the most divine tiramisu I've ever had either.  All in all, I think Dolce is a fabulous neighborhood restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere and low key vibe.  The Tuesday gnocchi is definitely worth trying out, and you would be hard pressed to find a better Italian restaurant in the QC.",

    "text": "\"ahhhhhhhhhh!\" (that's the sound I assume heaven makes when it opens up its pearly gates...)  Homemade gnocchi, kids. Yes indeedy, little potato made nuggets of love can be found here on Tuesdays. Why Tuesdays only? Well, gnocchi is pretty time consuming to create, so that's the day they offer it at Dolce. And it is deeeelightful.   I've been here twice, but finally remembered to hit up Dolce on a Tuesday for some delectable gnocchi. Since it was being delivered from Foodie Call, I had to make the difficult of decision of type of sauce, all of my own. I had no waiter to guide me...do I choose pesto? Or fresh tomato? Or four cheese? How about bolognese? Or maybe butter sage?! *head explodes*  Well, I went with the four cheese because I was at home and I was already sportin' my sweatpants. But I also requested a side of fresh tomato sauce too, just to have some variety available. Holy yum. These little nuggets of joy are superbly made, cooked just a bit al dente and bathing in just enough sauce...it'll make you say mmmmmmmmm. I  enjoyed the four cheese, but it was a bit heavy for me. The fresh tomato was a really nice alternative and I'm glad I ordered it.   What else did I order on this chunkerific night in for myself? Tiramisu, of course. I had to try it - and Dolce makes it well. Tasty layers of sweet ricotta mixed in with layers of rum and espresso soaked lady fingers. Well done, Dolce. It's not the best tiramisu I've had, but it's certainly solid. Nom.   Eat on, friends.",

I have never been more satisfied with food, service and price than I have the two times I've been to Dolce with my boyfriend.  Try the mushroom appetizer, it's incredible...and if you're not trying to spend a lot or if you don't want to induce a food coma (which is fine if you do) then split an entree, more than enough for two people.  No one leaves Dolce without the feeling of simplicity, and more importantly, quality.",

I think my favorite is the eggplant rotolloni, or however they spell it, and a side of the spaghetti .  The vegetables they serve with entrees are so simple but so yummy, just roasted or sauteed in some olive oil, but so good.  The gnocchi is great but I never remember to come on a Tuesday for it.   The stuffed mushrooms and mussels are great.  Really I could just cut and paste their menu and endorse everything on it!!  Prices are very reasonable, service is good and depending on how busy they are you can be in and out in 30 minutes!!  A definite staple in my Charlotte restaurant repertoire.",

The server was inexperienced, auctioned the food, passed plates to the guests, did not provide cheese or bread until asked.  The bread was slightly stale thin sliced white bread, no glass was offered with beer.  One of the meals didn't come out. After waiting for awhile and no one touching their food I asked the waiter if he knew we were missing a meal. He responded that they had burnt the shrimp but it would be out in a minute.  He brought it over no apology, no visit from the manager or owner.  At the end of the meal I asked the waiter if the late meal could be removed from the check.  He said he would check with the owner. He returned with the full check, item not removed with no explanation no visit from the owner.  We had appetizers, bottles of wine, 9 entrees. I have waited tables, managed restaurants, and I would never return and I wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "This was our first visit to Dolce. Upon arrival, we had to wait a few minutes before we were acknowledged though not a big deal as we could see that they were extremely busy. While we were waiting at the front desk, I overheard who the lady, was sorting out someones payment, saying \"this better not be a groupon thing - grrrrr\".   Our waiter was extremely pleasant and patient while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive. He was also very knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu. The menu is quite different from other Italian restaurants we've been to - plenty of exciting dishes even for vegetarians... or so I thought until the waiter pointed out that almost all the dishes are cooked with chicken stock so VEGETARIANS BE AWARE of this. He said he'd ask the chefs to cook the pasta in water but I couldn't have the risotto as it was cooked in chicken stock. I had the Rotolini which is eggplant stuffed with ricotta and my husband had the spaghetti. The portions are generous but we found the food over salted & hence couldn't finish our food because of this. The rest in our group said their food was excellent and they thoroughly enjoyed their meal.   I think this place is over priced and over crowded; my husband and I would have enjoyed the food if it wasn't over-salted. We may try it again, this time with a groupon coupon....let's see if we have a better dining experience then.",

    "text": "One of the hardest parts of moving from New York to Charlotte was saying goodbye to good Italian restaurants. We've been to a couple down here but none could compare to what the Empire State could provide. Yet I'm never opposed to giving a place a first try, so when we saw an online deal for Dolce it was enough to entice us for a trip down to Charlotte. I'm glad we went, because we now have our go-to Italian restaurant.  Dolce is located in a strip mall-type area, which I'm always a fan of when venturing into Charlotte since it makes parking a breeze. We had a reservation and were greeted and seated upon entering the restaurant. It's a bit tight inside, and while the patio area looked a bit more comfortable the tables had all been reserved for a party later that night. The interior, while a bit cramped, was cozily decorated and really made it feel like an Italian restaurant. Our waiter was like the \"low talker\" from Seinfeld and I could barely hear a word he said, and the overall background sound of the place due to the tight quarters didn't help a bit. I had to ask him to repeat himself a couple of times and felt like a jerk for doing so, but what else can you do when your waiter can't speak up?  For an appetizer we had the special of the night, which was kind of like a deconstructed bruschetta. We got toasted bread with the tomatoes on the side, and a mozzarella SPREAD. I've never seen mozzarella prepared like this, and it was pretty dang good. There was also free bread service that was served alongside beans, which we've seen at one or two other Italian places in the area.   For dinner I ordered the Bolognese ($15.95), and it was mind-blowing. It's such a simple dish, with spaghetti served with a meat sauce made of pork, beef and veal. I've had the dish at some other places and it was either sweet or bland, but this bolognese was tastetacular! The meat chunks played very nicely with the simple tomato sauce that was not overpowered with sugar or other unnecessary flavors.   The missus had the Frutti Di Mare ($20.95) which was decent. The sauce had a bit of a kick to it with the heat, and the mussels were pretty good. The shrimp were a bit small and the scallops were non-existent, something we didn't catch until after the meal was over and she realized there hadn't been one on her plate. Just the spaghetti with a couple of mussels and small shrimp was not much of a meal for her, but the taste was solid.  For dessert we split the Tiramisu ($8) and that proved to be a great bite. It had just the right amount of espresso flavor where it wasn't ridiculously strong and bitter, but still had a bit of that bite to it. The lady finger structure was done right and had great texture. It was a dessert worthy of any Italian restaurant.  Dolce really proved to be a fantastic Italian eatery that I would be proud to take my visiting family to. They offer solid food at a reasonable price, and the staff aside from our server seemed to be on the ball. We'll definitely be back in the future, and I would really like to return on a Tuesday when they make their fresh gnocchi.",

Tables are close together and during the dinner hours it got pretty loud.  All of the food ordered was prepared very well.  All others had salads that were ample in size for the price.  I had the sausage and cheese filled mushrooms with a pink cream sauce.  It was juicy and very flavorful.  I had the night's special: panko crusted NC trout topped with crab meat and scallion cream.  Very rich, moist and full of flavors. A friend had the pasta du jour which was enough for two people.   No complaints from him.  My wife enjoyed the cheese filled eggplant roulades too.  The dessert selection is ample and homemade. The cheesecake was light; I had a slice of the lemoncelllo cake.  Light yellow cake with the freshness of lemons.  The icing was complementary and not over sweet.  The experience would have been perfect if our table wasn't in the corner by the wait/bus station.  We heard empty bottles being thrown into the garbage all night. Plus the staff kept cutting through with food. Guess it was like getting the table by the kitchen door!   I would return but it is not a destination restaurant.",

    "text": "Husband and I usually tend to be pretty budget-conscious, even when we're treating ourselves to a meal out. So, Dolce wouldn't have made it onto our usual radar without the help of a group coupon deal. I'm really glad it did!  The ambiance of the place is sweet, and I imagine might have an even more intimate feel after dark - tables are snug, with candles on all of them, but as we dined fairly early to skip the crowds, it was too light to have need of them.  Our waiter, Matt, seemed pretty knowledgeable of both the food and wine menus. I was having trouble deciding between a few dishes, but was able to narrow down based on his recommendation, plus he helped Husband find a great wine pairing for his dish (and one that he wouldn't have picked on his own). Service was always very prompt and he made sure we were taken care of from start to finish.  After we ordered, a basket of bread (white italian bread, sliced, room-temperature; nothing terribly special) and dish of marinated white beans, tomatoes, onions and herbs was set out to stave off our hunger until the mains arrived. If they could work on a better bread offering, this freebie app would be off the charts!  Surprisingly quickly after that, our entrees appeared - I went with the pasta Amatriciana (rigatoni with spicy red sauce featuring sauteed shallots and pancetta - $16.95) and added shrimp (+$3); Husband ordered the veal Marsala ($19.95), which sides of the day featured green beans and risotto.   My pasta was pretty damn delicious. No, the pasta didn't taste like it was made in house, but it *was* high quality, and cooked appropriately al dente, AND well sauced - not too much, not too little, well-coated on each noodle, *without* a big saucy puddle in the middle. I honestly wasn't expecting to be super impressed, but after my first bite, I was hooked! The shrimp was large, fresh and perfectly cooked, and the sauce super-flavorful. The portion size was appropriate for one person with possible leftovers, depending on how hungry that person was - but there certainly wasn't the overabundance you can get with some \"italian\" chains who give you a 1lb box per plate. The sauce was quite a bit richer than I expected, likely due to the pancetta, but it was worth every tasty morsel. Other diners I passed in the restaurant had some SERIOUSLY tasty-looking fettuccine dishes that I'd love to try on another visit.   Husband's dinner was similarly delicious, but larger in portion. I joked that next time we ate there, we should just order what he got and split it - but that's not really a joke! His dish included two huge flat-pounded veal filets that were positively smothered in mushrooms and big pieces of prosciutto, along with good-sized servings of green beans (I didn't catch the details of how they were prepared...it seemed like they may have been sauteed with some sort of tomato sauce + bacon?) and risotto. After he'd eaten his fill (and shared a lot of mushrooms and green beans with me) there was still a ton of food left on the plate. We couldn't even bear to think of making room for dessert.   Another Yelper mentioned that upon paying with a group coupon, the bill came back with an automatic gratuity added in. That was not the case for us, though I wouldn't necessarily have minded if it did, since I understand how businesses - and servers - are sometimes at risk of being stiffed by folks who forget to tip based on their total bill.  Our meal was definitely worth more than what we paid for it, and good enough that we'd consider returning to Dolce. For our particular wallet limits, though, it would probably have to wait for a special occasion, or for another great coupon deal to roll around. Or maybe we can just get the in-laws to spring for supper next time they visit... ;)",

Ok wine selection...my man the vino expert chose a mostly-Sangiovese blend that went well with our meal. About what you'd expert, price wise.  Of course we ordered gnocchi! Paul our waiter was helpful in suggesting what sauce to choose. I had the special style with lobster claw meat, spinach, and tomato cream sauce. VERY tasty and mondo flavorful. Lots of lobster and kinda scant on the spinach, oddly. My husband had the pesto which was classic and well done. When I make it I go crazy with the garlic so other pesto always seems a bit to tame to me :) No apps his time but the cannellini bean/tomato/garlic stuff that came with the bread was delicious.  The only slightly bad part of the evening was the faint smell of paint in the dining room - it had been painted recently (and not too well considering the drips we saw - oops!) I like this place. We'll go again. Try the gnocchi!",

We made reservations as the Groupon stated we should but honestly I don't think they would have been needed. The place was full but nothing over the top. The decor was not the worst I have seen but not exactly enjoyable/cozy. We were sat at an 'in between' sort of table and it was really uncomfortable the entire dinner and very very small. My next complaint would be about the service, pretty much everyone who worked here aside from the bus boy was not very friendly. Finally, the food was decent but very very overpriced for what you got. I had the penne with vodka sauce which was good but again nothing worth the cost. My husband had the shrimp linguine with cream sauce, he wasn't all that impressed. All in all we would not come back. Even after the Groupon (worth $40) the dinner was $60.",

I have been going to dolce for 8 years now - I love their food, but service has been going downhill and my experience tonight made me want to share a review.   First things first - the food - was very good, per usual. I got the fresca salad and the pollo al limone. My husband got the frutti di mare, a spicy seafood linguine with red sauce. His was better, nice amount of heat and excellent fresh pasta.  Now, the negative. Service was really poor tonight - the restaurant was 1/3 full when we arrived at 7pm and we were seated at a 2-top in a middle row. I asked to be moved out of the middle, as there were 5 open tables, all for 2 people right near us, not in the middle where we'd be bumped and squeezed. the hostess went to ask, and I could hear Luisa(the owner) yelling at her that we had no choice but to sit there, they were full. We did have a reservation, so it wasn't like they were squeezing us in. For the rest of our hour and 15 minute dinner, 3 of the open tables I requested remained empty.  Ok, so I didn't like my table. Not the biggest deal. But then.... The server. No water refills, no offer for wine refills, and he didn't want to recommend anything, even if asked. I had an empty salad plate and empty water glass for 10 minutes and he walked by empty handed at least 5 times and didn't pick anything up or refill my water. I used to wait tables and I understand being busy or in the weeds, but this wasn't the case. He seemed to think that picking up dishes or refilling waters wasn't his job, so he didn't do it.   But then... Still with empty tables around us, Luisa (the owner) walks by, stops next to our table and starts yelling into the kitchen about seating and wine. And I mean yelling - we had to stop our conversation because she was standing over my head.   So, food was good, my company was excellent and we made the best of it. I must recommend take out, or trying another place if you're looking for a romantic evening.",

    "text": "We went to Dolce because we had a Groupon.  I enjoyed the \"bread and beans\" - very Italian.  Our appetizer was the stuffed mushrooms - very filling and good enough to be a main entree.  I had the Amatriciana and my boyfriend had the Bolognese.  Both were great and with generous portions.  Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert.  My two minor complaints were our wait for glasses of water and the distance between tables - conversations were very close.   I would definitely go again.",

    "text": "When the $50 Groupon offer arrived in my inbox, I jumped at the opportunity, as I have had a good experience here in the past.  I made reservations for 8:00 on Friday night under my full name.  Apparently there was another \"Stephanie\" party, and we were seated at an empty table of 10.  Needless to say, everyone was confused, but the owner came by and straightened everything out.  She was very sweet and accommodating.  We ordered a bottle of wine and two appetizers: the buratta special which was extraordinary and the stuffed mushrooms which were quite tasty as well.  The timing was a bit off though. We did not get our bread or any of the appetizers for about 30 minutes after the wine came out.  I was starting to get a little dizzy. I recommend the servers bring out the bread at the same time as the drinks.   The appetizers were the highlight of the evening. For my main dish, I ordered the mugniaia- tilapia sauteed with cherry tomatoes, sweet red peppers, capers, Italian olive & Pinot Grigio sauce.  The fish was not bad, but the broccoli it came with was overcooked and honestly reminded me of cafeteria broccoli.  The food was not bad, but for the price, I expected more.    Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts in the world, so of course we had to order one of those.  I would have rather stopped by Menchie's on the way home for some $4.00 dulce de leche fro yo than eat that. I stopped after two bites.  The lady fingers were very dry and lacking in flavor.  I was pretty bummed as I was so excited to eat here (it was my idea after all).  For Italian, I much prefer Rudy's and Toscana at South Park.",

    "text": "Me and my friend went on Tuesday 6/24 sat inside next to the entrance. We were glad we made reservation and skipped the 40 mins wait. We sat down and waited about 40-50 mins when our food were ready. That's ok, I understand it's a small restaurant and a lot people and Tuesday night special....... The food was OK, and it feels like a decent restaurant.   Our check was $66.63, we had a coupon worth $50, so the rest of the bill was $16.63. The waiter brought our check, I thought my friend's coupon took care of everything then asked him for a pen. He was impatient the whole time, and told me in a really mean way:\"you didn't give me your card yet!\". Well, my bad for not knowing the situation. I was mad, and wrote $9 (14%) instead of a normal 15% or above tips. So the total was 25.63. Guess what, I happened to check my account today, it lists $30.63. Forgive me if there are other explanations such as I time traveled to the restaurant and changed my \"SIGNED\" receipt, otherwise, I really think somebody changed my receipt.   If you are not happy with 14%, go think about how to please your customers and make them happy; if you can't stand my question due to lack of information, you probably need to learn how to communicate with other people; If you need to change my SIGNED receipt, you better be careful.  My credit card company gave me $10 back which all I really need is $5, so I'm not here because I lost money, but to tell everyone to be careful of your SIGNED receipt, and don't sit on the patio or next to the entrance, because this is the area where this waiter hanging out.   I'll make sure I post this post everywhere, not for the $5, just hope nobody else goes through same experience. Of course, I'll guarantee none of my friends will go there.",

On my most recent visit, we were rudely seated at a middle table right by the entrance at 5pm on a weeknight even though the rest of the place was completely empty because as the manager explained, they had sent out an email to \"their regulars\" for some specials and were saving tables for them...an email which we received and planned to use.",

    "text": "We've driven/walked by this place a thousand times since it's only 2 blocks from us and always said we should go sometime.  But that time never came...until our old friend the Groupon showed up one magical day.  So we finally had a reason to go and after going our only regret is not discovering this place sooner.    It's a relatively small, cozy place inside (too cold for outside when we went) which I think is what you want for a more upscale italian place.  Our waiter was great and really helped explain the dishes and provide some excellent suggestions.  The wine and beer were great.  The food was fantastic.  We ordered an appetizer they had on special...don't remember the name but it was like soft mozzarella wrapped in other mozzarella...phenomenal.  For entrees we got the vodka penne with chicken and the gnocci (we unknowingly went on gnocchi night) which were both great.  But again me being a dessert traditionalist I was a little let down by the cheesecake.  They do theirs with mascarpone...so I figure well I like mascarpone and I like cheesecake...lets put those babies together.  But alas all I truly wanted was NY style cheesecake.  But really I'm nitpicking at this point.  This place is great.  We give it 4.5 dolce's out of 5",

    "text": "A big fat Meh.   Admittedly I am a huge Italian snob, I grew up eating a ton of it and really adore the cuisine. After reading so many fabulous reviews I was prepared to be blown away!  We dined outside in their patio under the awning (in a busy parking lot)  on a Tuesday night - not the most secluded nor relaxing, but it's in a strip mall of sorts and the beautiful night made it A-ok with me.   We started with the Funghi appetizer (baked mushrooms/cheese/sausage with cognac cream sauce). While the flavor was good the mushrooms were way off temperature wise and tasted barely heated through. I would have been happy with this dish if the food was hot.  I don't mind paying almost $7 for a salad if the dressing is delicious. I am shocked that they advertising their Caesar dressing as homemade because it tastes suspiciously like a pre-mix bag salad kit dressing. I did like that it had an egg on the side but it was nothing special - not even particularly good. I didn't  finish mine.  My main course was the raved about gnocchi. I went with the 4 cheese sauce and split that with a friend who had the bolognese (fyi it is $3 extra if you want extra sauce on the side). The pasta was WAY overcooked, pretty much balls of mush. The sauces were lackluster. I did get to try the other two (pesto and brown butter sage). The pesto was voted best among the group, but I really thought it was nothing special. I've had much better gnocchi...Aria for example.   Our server was a nice guy who really tried to accommodate us, though he was entirely too quiet. I could barely hear him and I was closest seated to the end.   Overall it was a bit of a let down, on to the next Italian restaurant....",
