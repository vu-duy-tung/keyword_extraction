We also ordered BBQ platters and they told us they had no BBQ sauce.  The BBQ was ok.  The sweet potato casserole and cole slaw were good. Service was friendly.  Lots of staff taking care of us.  I'll give this place some time to work out the kinks before giving it a second chance.",

    "text": "Pretty standard Greek or American diner type food for breakfast and lunch which is what I was hoping for as I watched them build the place from the ground up over the last year. They did a good job with the construction and it's beautiful inside and out, and the staff was nice and attentive and the black eyed peas and bean and corn relish or whatever you want to call it with flour tortilla chips is a nice touch. I also liked their bread which seemed baked in house, and my buddy Tom's grilled chicken was good. He said they were small but he got two and the prices are reasonable so he had no complaints. We both liked the vegetables we got too, homestyle stuff like lima beans and broccoli casserole for me and green beans and a salad for Tom. My main gripe is with the \"chicken and stuffing casserole\" I got, which was the daily special. First, I'm not sure you want your waitress describing the dish as chicken and stuffing cooked with \"Cream of Celery soup.\" While that is probably the recipe based on what I had and it evokes the homestyle cooking the restaurant to trying to push, in today's restaurant market where you're competing against chef driven places that stresses fresh and local ingredients - which The Bridge is trying to do too by mentioning farmers in their \"About us\" paragraph on their menu and website - I don't think it's good overall to have your wait staff bring up an image of a cook in the kitchen using Campbell's Cream of Celery Soup to make a dish you're selling in a restaurant. The other thing that really annoyed me was the dish itself and the portion. I guess I was expecting something like cafeteria style turkey and dressing or Boston Market's chicken pot pie, where there's at least a few big slices or chunks of chicken. What I got, and which I took pictures of, was an ice cream scoop sized ball of stuffing with maybe a table spoon of small pieces of chicken that looked like they had been picked off another dish, like maybe the cook had some leftover baked chicken or something and decided to make a daily special out of it. There were no chunks of chicken, nothing that looked like it was cut up specifically for the dish, or even anything bigger than the size of peas. And even if there were, how much chicken can you get in an ice cream scoop of \"chicken and stuffing casserole,\" which was basically stuffing. Full disclosure: I'm a chef school drop out from Johnson & Wales and I've only cooked professionally for a few months, but I did get an A in menu planning and recipe cost analysis, and the generally accepted rule for food cost is 33% of the menu price. I'd estimate the recipe cost on my \"chicken\" and stuffing casserole scoop, broccoli casserole scoop and lima beans to be around $1, and the menu price was $7.95. That just annoys me, plus just not getting any chicken when it was supposed to be my protein for the meal. Charge me another $2 if you want, but for my main non vegetable dish called a type of chicken casserole I'd like to eat at least a couple of ounces of chicken. Some chefs will use their daily specials to feature items using seasonal ingredients or ingredients they bought in small quantities or just to test out a dish before adding it to the menu. The Bridge seems to be starting in another direction with their daily specials, which is too bad, because this place is 3 minutes from my house and it has the potential to be a very good restaurant.",

What I love most about about The Bridge is that it captures the True heart of southern home cooking. Not imitation or trying to flair up old recipes, it's real southern food I grew up eating. They also listen to feedback so don't be afraid to give them your opinion. They are locally owned and have been residents of the area there whole lives, they know the people and the food they love and bring that to the table. They also feature great desserts from cheese cake to banana pudding. The first time I walked in it felt like I was walking to grandmas house for Sunday supper. Talking with the owners they want to be able to give back to the community and be a helpful part of it. If you're in the Indian trail/Hemby Bridge/Charlotte area go.",

Parking- not overly crowded. Easy to find and get to with two different entries/exits. Gravel is nice, no mud. First impression, THIS IS CUTE! Cute set up, small and quaint, nicely decorated to get the home cooking country feel. Hostess was extremely sweet and greeted us promptly.  Waitress came and greeted us in a timely fashion, was nice and went over menu with us. Drinks came in mason jars which was a cute touch! Wait staff may need a little over view of what's in the \"hemby bridge caviar\" as she wasn't sure what was in it so we were apprehensive to try. Ordered hamburger steak and Cajun chicken pasta. Hamburger steak was perfect. Cajun chicken was amazing alone but the Pasta was just ok. Cream sauce was chunky like it hadn't been mixed well and lacked a little flavor. I wouldn't order that again. But that chicken alone would make an awesome sandwich of some sort.  Opted out of desserts.  Overall was fine. Would try breakfast and lunch before going back for dinner.",

Our waitress, Megan, was lovely. The food came out in a timely manner, except for the side salad which my son would have preferred as an appetizer but came with the meal. Not a big deal. The food was delicious! My kids are picky and they were happy. There was enough grilled chicken to take home...two huge pieces came on the plate, and one of them went home with the salad for a nice dinner that night. We always rate our restaurants on a scale of 1-10 when we leave and it got a 7-9 from all three of us. Can't wait to go again!

Today, Tuesday was chicken and dumplings with one side and meatloaf with two. We had a group of six and were offered several different options of places to sit. I was thrilled with the \"cowboy caviar \" field peas corn and other things. It was excellent!! Most got the chicken and dumplings. I couldn't decide so I got a vegetable plate to take home and a chef salad to eat there. Everyone was pleased!! The service was kind, fast and very attentive. I would love to know their squash casserole recipe..... promote whoever came up with that!! I highly recommend this treasure, who pride themselves on the beliefs and traditions of their families before them!! I remember this building when it was a convenience store, even then I felt like family coming through reading their meter and stopping in to say hi and get a piece of hoop cheese and TRYING to buy a mnt dew, he never would take my money!!",

    "text": "The Bridge is a traditional diner-style spot in Hemby Bridge. You don't come to a place like this looking for Michelin starred meals; you come for simple, hearty food. On our visit, The Bridge delivered.   I have to address the parking situation that's been mentioned in several reviews before mine -- but I didn't see the issue. There's an expansive gravel lot behind the place. You really can't miss it, so I'm not sure where many people seem to be having trouble.   Our party of three was greeted and shown to our seats immediately when we arrived near 1pm on a Saturday. Our server, Terri, let us know that she was new to The Bridge and was still getting used to her touchscreen ordering system. It only seemed to take her a moment, and she was funny and pleasant in her delivery.   Our meals came out quickly. I ordered The Big K, which is a sandwich with thick cut fried bologna topped with chili and onions. I asked for gluten free bread, which I was so pleased to see on the menu. I wouldn't expect little places like this to go out of their way to make GF accommodations -- most diners and small town spots don't -- and it was nice to order something directly off the menu instead of cobbling together a vegetable plate. Even better: there's not an additional charge for GF bread and buns. Their website says, \"why should you have to pay for having an allergy you can't help?\" Preach!  My sandwich was excellent. I know bologna has a poor reputation, but it was delightful and I'm not too pretentious to order processed meat. The addition of chili and onions put it over the top. I would order this again in a heartbeat. I had slaw on the side, which was served in a very fine dice. The flavors were well balanced and it didn't leave a puddle on my plate.  We did not stay for dessert, as we were planning to go to Snoball Cabin next door, but I hear the homemade desserts at The Bridge are great.   Once our check came, we were directed to pay at the cashier by the door. The three of us left with full bellies.   The only thing I feel The Bridge is missing is an all-day breakfast menu. The Charlotte region needs more places to get bacon and eggs at 2pm, and I'm confident this spot would be killer with that option.",

    "text": "Very frustrated with this experience.  I waited to go to The Bridge because of the bad reviews on how slow service was.  Today I have it a shot and here's my feedback:  The staff all were very friendly.  We were greeted with smiling faces and quickly taken to our seats.  It's a beautiful little restaurant, nicely remodeled with awesome outdoor seating at the intersection of a one light town.  A few minutes after we were seated our waitress came and asked for our order.  I started off with our drink order, as I write this I now think she didn't recognize we didn't have drinks.  She took our order and off she went.  She brought our drinks back in a timely manner, but only half.  Several minutes later I finally saw her again to ask for our drinks.  It seemed to be able 15 minutes later before our food came.  I'm not overly upset about the delay but what is aggravates me is when the food was dropped off I heard one waitress say \"let me get you syrup.\"  We waited about five minutes before I had to get up to go to the waitress station to ask for syrup and a few other things.    The food was actually really good.  The country ham was a little small and the edges were over cooked but the rest of our meal was great.  They have the best sawmill/ sausage gravy I've ever eaten!  I don't say that lightly.  By the way, the drinks we had to follow up with as I mentioned earlier were now empty and no one to refill them.  During our visit the first third of the time we were there went off without a hitch.  A couple of the staff members stopped by to make sure we \"placed\" our order but our waitress left us high and dry.  I never got a receipt and had to chase that down, I had some food I was taking to go and had to walk out with it in my hands with no container.    I'll probably give this place one more shot because I think we just got a dud...we shall see.",

Best of all, they have a large selection of Gluten Free options available at no additional cost. This includes breads, pancakes, even GF bacon! This is hard to find in Charlotte, let alone the burbs.  The Bridge is currently open for breakfast and lunch Monday-Thursday, all day Friday- Saturday, close Sunday.

    "text": "You can't miss this happy little place conspicuously monopolizing an entire corner of the very busy intersection at Idlewild and Indian Trail-Fairview roads. Also, conspicuous is the seemingly always packed gravel parking lot out back. Being fairly new to that area, I have enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner amidst the locals who have packed the homey cabin-like dining room my every visit. It is a total and refresh departure from the Ballantyne environment that I am used to.   I really want to love it and there's a lot to love starting with the down home, friendly service from the time you enter until to pay your bill at the checkout counter (where by the way, they take prayer requests). The dining room, consisting of a beautiful wood paneled main room and an enclosed side porch, is a delightful throughback to yesteryear. The menu is diverse, and prices are very reasonable. There is also an ice cream shop attached.  Since my last lunch review here, I have had breakfast and dinner. The Big Bridge Breakfast is indeed big, and at $7.95, is also a great value. It consists of three eggs, choice of pork chops, bacon, sausage or liver mush, choice of  grits or hash browns, and two large pancakes. Overall, everything was okay, but I found the eggs to be a bit dry, and the grits and pancakes both seemed instant. My wife love her Spinach & Feta Omelet however. It was loaded with good stuff and also ran $7.95. Service, as usual, was superb.  For dinner, we started off with the made-in-house Buffalo Chicken Egg Rolls ($8), which were interesting but a little too greasy for us.  My wife and daughters all got salads topped with chicken for around $11 each, while I opted for the 8oz sirloin, huge baked potato and a side salad for $13. The salads were fresh and plentiful. My steak however, while cooked perfectly, was just way too salty (which was a problem that I also experienced at lunch). Of course, I know that, going forward, to simply ask for no added salt.  Again, for lunch, see my prior review. There's a whole lot to like about this place. I expect to return. Eventually I will figure out it's nuances. In the meantime, since Yelp does not allow me to assign 3.5 stars, I feel that, considering the whole package, I must round up to 4. Rounding the other way would be an injustice.",

    "text": "I live in the area and have passed by here many times. Had never eaten here, but decided to give it a try. My friend and I stopped by on a Friday evening. After a reasonable wait time, we were seated at a comfortable booth and were greeted by a friendly waitress. Took our drink order and quickly got our beverages. However, our experience went downhill from there.    O.K. , it was Friday night and kind of expected \"a family restaurant\", but soon realized that this place is NOISY! After placing our food order, we experienced a lengthy wait, ever for a Friday evening. Even a bustling wait staff did not prepare us for what followed.    My friend ordered a 'burger with a side of \"glazed\" carrots. I decided to try one of the advertised \"specials\", a Shrimp Dinner. When the food finally arrived, we had to ask for napkins and silverware. (No setup on the table). Her hamburger was hard and almost inedible. The \"glazed\" carrots were more like steamed and not very appealing. My Shrimp Dinner was a real disappointment. The breaded shrimp was very salty and about a third of it was little crumbly, hard pea sized breading. I did however, find the baked potato fairly decent. Had to ask for tarter sauce and drink refills.    We worked our way through the edible parts of the meal and received our check. I am generally a fair tipper, but was a little taken aback by a 3.5% credit card charge added to our bill. Who does that in a debit-card world? Added a decent tip to charge and left. This will more than likely be our first and last visit. There are too many places within 2 or 3 miles with much more enjoyable experiences.",

What makes this place special in my opinion is the kindness of the employees and patrons.  Definitely has the small town feel.  Lots of daily/regular customers who are very friendly and will strike up a conversation with you and make you feel welcomed.   The waitresses use iPads to enter their orders in to the kitchen and this provides a very efficient system for paying your bill too.!!",

    "text": "I never knew this restaurant existed until Ginny suggested that we meet there for lunch.  Hemby Bridge is a part of town that is unfamiliar to me. This restaurant was easy to find as it was only a few miles off of 485. It was a big stop in the road with an imposing brown cabin like structure.   The ambiance was alluring well before I even stepped foot inside the restaurant.   For lunch, I had the chicken tenders, tossed salad, and fried squash.  I didn't expect the chicken tenders to be fried, but they were.   With so much fried food and a roll, I asked for honey.  That made it even that much better comfort food!  The fried squash was a show stopper.  Yummy! I must add that the iced tea was fresh and very good.   It had a Cracker Barrel feel to it, but with much better food. Lots of good comfort food options!  The prices were extremely reasonable.   Very fun experience and Two thumbs up!",

Much preferred over the plethora of fast food options nearby. I did not expect anything less. The service was reasonable considering it was peak lunch rush and there were no empty tables when we arrived. Maybe it seemed to take longer than some would prefer, didn't really bother me, as I had asked for a change to my sandwich, the kitchen was slammed and only can do so much with the space available. I'll be back.",

I flag a lady down and we leave so we pretty much came to eat and couldn't even take a bite of our food because the people were more interested in getting out by 9 then making sure the guest are taken care of",

    "text": "Months have passed since my first visit so decided to stop in for breakfast on a Friday. No wait. Plenty of open tables. Light crowd. The decor is still warm and cozy. Reminiscent of a log cabin.   I did wait a bit for my order to be taken and it did take awhile to be served. Most likely due to the staff congregating behind that counter and chatting.   Not once offered a refill and had to flag the waitress a few times for additional things I needed.  As for what I had this time around- the eggs still tasted fresh. Bacon again was not crisp enough and somewhat bland. Potatoes were ok. Pancake was tasteless and gritty. Still no rich buttermilk taste or fluff. Steak is now on menu so I ordered it. It was pretty sad. Not sure of the cut but it was very tough and oddly seasoned. I took about two bites and decided I was not a fan.  Overall, my breakfast this time was disappointing. Service could use improvement. With the right cooks and cooking methods this place truly has potential. Such a great location and space that I really hope the food does get taken up quite a few notches.",

Since they are a creamery with kids toys they should have a restroom for their customers, since they don't we unfortunately will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying, \"We will go back.\"   I am giving it a 3-star rating for a few reasons, but there were some 5-star qualities.   The atmosphere was wonderful. The gravy, biscuits, bacon, eggs, grits, and fruit were delicious. The pricing was on point. The serving proportions were generous.   Lisa C. was our server, and she was extremely nice.   The lower rating is due to the following:  1) the coffee was extremely weak and watered down.   2) the pancakes were too heavy and room temperature. My mom ate 3 small bites of two of the pancakes and threw them to the side. No one even asked why she did not finish them or eat much of them. The syrup was cold, making the pancakes even colder.   3) to a minor point, there was eggshell in my food. Mistakes like this can happen, which is not a big deal.   Nevertheless, with a 3-star rating, Lisa as our server, good atmosphere, and the gravy was some of the best, we will be happy to return soon. Hopefully, we can give a better rating then. I live in Los Angeles, so my family will be returning sooner than I.",

When I arrived I found out that the restaurant charges an additional 3.5% on top of the order to take my credit card payment. Is this 2019? Unbelievable!i almost sure they charge more than the bank charges them. Most bank fees are around 2.75% for to accept credits. The meal was ok.. BBQ was way too smokey. I wouldn't order it again. The corn cassias good though.  I'm not sure if I would go back just because of the cc fee.",
