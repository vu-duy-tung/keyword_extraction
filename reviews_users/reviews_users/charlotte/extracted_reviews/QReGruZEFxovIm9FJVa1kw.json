The best part about Zio is that their food is flavorful without being overly salty and heavy. Their past dishes are outstanding. Their pizza is top notch. The grilled pizza is a special treat with a thin crust that is crispy. It is also a great place to take a family with young children.",

Last night as usual the Speedies were fast and great ,Perfect, really!  The House made Fetticunni was very good, though the Marinara was way too watery and not as rich in flavor as it is sometimes.  The service was great!    The dessert was Chocolate Cake made in house I'll rate the cake at 1.5 yelp stars to be generous!  Of course I would return because it has been so good in the past and this place has great potential to be romantic!",

    "text": "I've recently relocated from upstate ny and have been super nervous to attempt pizza in Charlotte. I've never actually left a review for a place but this experience has been less than ideal.   The first issue was that we ordered online. The confirmation email stated what time out order would be ready. Showed up within 5 mins of estimated time and they never took the order off the printer.  The only reason I didn't leave two stars is because there was a complimentary beverage for my friend for the inconvenience.   I ordered the caprese salad- this was a nightmare. I order this type if salad most places I go and this was definitely quite disgusting. The tomato (or 2/3 of a tomato) I got had definitely been refrigerated for at least a few days. It was pale orange and mushy. There were also like three tiny halved cherry tomatoes of equal refrigeration tossed in. Strange. The dressing (oil and balsamic ) was left in separate containers to add in myself. The only issue is that the balsamic was the consistency of motor oil. Not ideal.   We also ordered a plain pie. It was ok. Very very thin crust, a little undercooked on the bottom.   Overall I would say I wouldn't waste my time here for the pizza and don't even think about wasting the $7 or so bucks on that caprese salad.",

I would like to say that it would have been nice if you let me know your pasta was dry cause I would have gotten you something  different- sorry about that. Our pasta is usually really good. It was after 9 which means we had already closed. We all really care about your experience and do our best. On a side note calling my co worker Marc an ogre is completely uncalled for. He's super knowledgeable about the menu. He works his butt off and couldn't be a nicer person. He's also smart and funny. You should be aware that these reviews are often read out loud at work meetings. Keep it about what we can improve- constructive criticism. Not what server is attractive enough to serve you. :(",

If you get some crappy dry pasta at Harris Teeter, dump some store bought tomato sauce on it, you then would have the dish that we were served.  It sucked.    The service was horrific.  Our initial server appeared to have Ogre DNA.  I say that from both an aesthetic standpoint and from an intellectual point of view.  We waited and waited.  Then he asked \"Are you ready to order?\".  We enthusiastically said \"Yes!\" as we had been waiting for a while.  He then walked away and after another 10 minutes passed I asked for a different server who was very good.  It's not as though the place was busy with it being after 9PM at this point.    It's too bad.  I really liked this place a lot initially.  But now I won't be rushing back.",

First, when I walked in there was an awful smell... kind of like dirty wet dish rags and reminded me of a dive bar bathroom.  Okay, after 5-10 minutes you get used to it, and we were sat near the door so maybe its not so bad elsewhere in the restaurant.  Either way, its a bad smell and needs to be corrected.  On to the food... I read most of the reviews to figure out what best to order... started with the harvest salad (pretty good - I would recommend), then we got the angel hair pasta with meatballs (not bad, but nothing special) and then we got the grilled pizza (not my fav).  The pizza was supposed to have mozarella cheese, but it was so salty and was either not mozarella or was a very cheap one, like the kind that pizza shops use when they are cutting corners on cost.  I had high hopes, but the pizza let me down.  For now, I'll stick with Pure Pizza until I find one better.",

I recently tried the glutton free pasta and it was really good. I like how they have a fresh pasta selection as well. I have found that the vast majority of dishes do not disappoint. Zio's gets extra points for their incredible bread.   Zio's is a nice little neighborhood Italian restaurant with an old school vibe - especially the cool oversized bar area. The restaurant is sectioned off into a bar area & booth seating on the left (I like to think of it as the adult area) and a louder family friendly area on the right. I count Zio Casual Italian among the best Italian Restaurants in Charlotte for a consistently good, affordable meal. And, the bread.",

It was hovering around 60 degrees outside. Uncomfortable but we suck it out.   We were seated at a booth that was uncomfortably small for two people and entrees on the table at the same time. We proceeded to order two pizzas since we assumed they were small personal pizzas. Once I looked around at other pizzas I realized the pizzas were 14\" and there was no way two of the could fit on the table and it would be way too much for two people.   After canceling our second pizza after the debacle, we ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the goat cheese dip. The goat cheese dip came out and I was very disappointed. Goat cheese is already creamy and it came out melted looking like a clam chowder. Nothing would stick to the pita points served with it. It had decent flavor but the texture was horrible. The pizza, on the other hand, was really good and the prosciutto was nice and salty. I would definitely like to go back since I think it can be better but I don't know when that will be. I really wanted to like it.",

The restaurant is below Primo in Myers Park.  It's not a fancy place and described as casual Italian.   The decor is simple with paneled walls and a little brick.  There's a bar to the left side of the restaurant, booths along the walls of the restaurant and tables in the open spaces.  There are few tables outside on the patio.  The menu is simple with pizzas, salads, pasta selections  and a few Italian entrees.  I went with one of my favorite Italian dishes, Chicken Piccata and a side house salad.    The salad was beautiful.  Shaved parmesan cheese on top of mixed greens and a few chunks of tomato with a homemade Italian dressing.  Absolutely delicious also.  The Chicken Piccata was a breast of chicken on top of angel hair pasta in a very light lemon, caper sauce.  There were a few veggies for a garnish on the side.  This has to be the best Chicken Piccata I've ever had.  The chicken was tender and was plain.,.not covered in flour and fried like many places do.  And the sauce was so light.  They even gave you a lemon wedge if you were craving more flavor.  My mouth was singing!    For dessert, someone said we needed to try the chocolate cake.  And they were right.  This cake was wonderful.  A light frosting covered a dense and moist chocolate cake.  But I also heard the tiramisu was really good also.  Service wise, our server was fantastic.  Every order was spot on and she explained specials and had no issues with splitting the bill for 9 people.    Definitely need to come back here.  This is by far, the best casual Italian place in Charlotte.",

The cheese pizza was pretty fabulous and the grilled arugula salad I had was equally good.    No matter the food you have to figure out how to train the wait staff.  We had no less than four people visit our table which isn't the issue.  The issue is that none of them really took ownership of said table.  I went without my second drink due to just plain forgetting to get it via the waiter.  Generally slow service.  Figure that out and you've got a good gig going.",

She is old school italian and has some of the same creepy black and white photos of random Italian families hanging on her walls...And her house has the aroma of garlic 24-7.  :)  No, seriously...I was impressed with Zio.  I don't eat Italian out very often because I prefer homemade sauce and pasta.  I am an Italian food snob because I come from an italian family...sorry, just being honest.  But, Zio was pretty decent.    I liked the atmosphere...as I described earlier..I expected grandma to walk out of the kitchen at any moment.  It is a low key, casual environment...which is great.  I went with the basic angel hair and meat sauce with meatballs dish.  It was very good.  The sauce was a little tangy and maybe slightly too salty for my taste but it was good and homemade so I can't complain.  The meatball was very good as well.  It was also homemade and had a lot of flavor.  My dining partners tried the Penne Vodka and the Salmon Piccata and they were very impressed.  The vodka sauce was a little runny but it still had great flavor and a ton of fresh cut garlic so that was awesome.   The bread they serve with your meal was very good but I will say the herb infused olive oil was a bit bland.  We had to add salt and pepper so it didn't just taste like vegetable oil.  I am questioning if they ran out of olive oil and just served us something else.  Not sure...  I hear the pizza is the way to go with Zio and I will definitely be back so that will be the next thing I try.  But, overall, I think it is a good, down-home, authenticish Italian restaurant here in Charlotte.",

I love this place because it's not to expensive. I'm surprised at the people that complain about how their prices have gone up. Hello, have any of y'all been to Olive Garden the fast food of Italian? This place is a good small place with great food!  If your into chain restaurants than go to Olive Garden but if your into good food go to Zio!",

    "text": "Zio is a tiny nook of a neighborhood place that serves casual Italian pasta, pizzas, and a handful of entrees in a very family friendly atmosphere (though they do have a bar) that is well-patronized by the local Myers Park and Eastover neighborhoods.  The location of Zio can make it a bit hard to find..  as you have to head down a set of shallow stairs to access it, with another restaurant up on top.  Being on an otherwise residential street is also a bit of a challenge, and on busier nights you will likely need to park on the street as well.  Once inside, though, you'll find a comfy, warm atmosphere - plenty of tables and booths on both sides of the place.  Do note that there is an early dinner rush here as parents get off work and look to bring the crew in for dinner.  Waits are common on Friday and Saturday,  The tables themselves come with a large helping of Italian bread, complete with a dipping oil.  Glasses of drinks are quite large and there is a nice selection of beers here, both local and imports.  As to the menu, it's stocked with salads, entrees, and pizzas of both the grilled and the baked variety.  Just don't go overboard with the toppings here- they get pricey pretty quickly and this is not a place that offers combos deals like the major chains do (but this is a good thing).  You'll find a handful of appetizers too, but I recommend you check out their specials on the chalk boards,  as there are always some good finds here.  Everything here is done pretty well, and their pizzas have a nice, thin crust with plenty of chew to keep things most and not brittle.  I even enjoy their salads and there are some good combos here- especially with roasted pear and creamy be cheese.  Service is generally good, though servers can get caught up quite quickly with the rush should you happen to stop in during a busier time.  However, this is not a white tablecloth place and things are a bit more relaxed.  For casual Italian with great pizza, this is a great choice.",

We had checked out the Yelp reviews before and were pleasantly surprised when we ordered and received our food.  We started with the calamari and it was amazing. We're pretty big sticklers on calamari but this one didn't disappoint. Next, I had the goat cheese/strawberry/mandarin orange salad dinner special and it was amaaaazing. The fried goat cheese was perfect and I was so happy I had ordered it.  My two friends both got really large pizzas for $11. They were really good also and we were all stoked on the great food we received. The prices are relatively inexpensive and the waiter was very friendly and was always attentive to us. I would definitely recommend Zio to anyone looking for quick, affordable and super yummy food!",

Zio has a warm feeling when you walk in the door, I mean the whiff of garlic knocks you down, heat pouring out of the kitchen, it is very comforting.   Even if you haven't been there, you know you have found a gem.  I have been a couple of times with large groups, great for ordering a lot of food and eating family style.  I love ordering a large pizza for an appetizer. YUM cheese overcooked please.   I went for lunch once and they told me they didn't serve pizza at lunch, that was a little mind boggling.    Maybe we should have our first 2010 CLT yelpers at Zio!!!",

The sauce was so fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly and layered with super thinly sliced meatballs and ground sausage and LOTS of cheese and was very, very yummy!  He had a bolognese dish with homemade noodles that were very good!  I also sampled a beef spiedies appetizer (thanks for the name fellow yelper!)  that was very tender and cooked and seasoned perfectly!  We enjoyed a beautiful deep purple blackberry gelato served with a flaky biscuit like pastry and strawberries (minus whipped cream at our request) as our dessert and LOVED it!  The ambiance is very unassuming yet quaint and the restaurant was full on a Wednesday night - always a good sign!  Our waiter was attentive and made some great suggestions and admissions of some menu items that were better than others in his opinion!    A great first experience to Zio and I would recommend it and try it again!",

She can't wait to go back!  She had the chicken piccata and loved every bite.  We saw lots of pizzas go out the door so the must be good and a neighborhood favorite!  We did try desserts. Hubby had tiramisu. Different than usual but still tasty. Chocolate cake was dry for me but friend liked it. My only wish would be to see more Italian wines by the glass on the menu.",

Our brother and sister-in-law came to meet us for a drink at the bar while we also had a drink and waited for our to-go order. The bartender, Crystal came from the other side of the bar to talk with us. She was kind, took our drink order, to-go order, etc. the other lady named Kristen could not have been more unwelcoming or rude to us.   After enjoying a glass of wine with our family while waiting for our to-go order, after about 15 minutes or so, we were asked to leave because children are not welcomed in the bar area. Our one year old daughter was sitting on our lap not making a sound but I'm assuming Kristen didn't feel we were ordering enough and wanted our seats taken for other customers so told us we had to leave. She seemed to be frustrated after my sister-in-law who is very pregnant didn't order a drink. To say this was distasteful is an understatement. She told us we needed to leave because we were technically breaking a law, but us being there for 30 minutes prior was no big deal. Our brother and sister-in-law are both attorneys and said there is no such law that exists.  I have worked in the service industry for over 10 years, have my own business myself, and have never felt more mistreated or uncomfortable. To say Kristen made a scene was an understatement. I have always been told Zio was a family establishment, but I can promise you I will encourage my friends and family to never attend this restaurant.  We are natives of Charlotte and semi new to the neighborhood. We have been excited to try your restaurant but were extremely disappointed. We left with a terrible taste in our mouth and will never be returning.  I hope this message is passed along to the correct person so that Kristen can hopefully never make anyone feel this uncomfortable again.  Sincerely, Caroline",

    "text": "This was one of my least favorite restaurant experiences. I was excited to have some good Italian food based on friends' advice, but was disappointed to be served partially cooked chicken, breading on the chicken that fell off, and a pasta dish that lacked pasta itself. When complaints were made to our waitress about our food, the waitress was unresponsive and hardly offered to make our meal better. A few of the people in our group ordered Shirley Temples, but were served a fountain soda that had a mysterious red liquid in it which tasted terrible. The waitress rarely tended to our table, and at the end of our meal, one of us needed to use the restroom only to find the toilet clogged. We notified staff of the clogged toilet, but they blew off our concern and had poor attitude. Overall, the staff did not listen to our complaints and our food was far below standards. This evening made us not want to eat at Zio again.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I'm going to be completely honest, I'm 100% biased to it because the original restaurant is actually from my hometown, from which I grew up 2 miles from. Not only the authentic recipes are the same from this little Upstate, New York gem, but the prices are reasonable and gives me a small piece of \"home\" down south.  If you're looking for True authentic wood fired pizza, Zio's is your best bet. I love their grilled arugla salad or daily specials. True italian! The staff is friendly, but a little slow. I recommend this at 4 stars because of their low beer/wine selection and limited seating. Otherwise, bring the kids for a casual sit down or grab a pizza to go and inhale!",

Sat in a nice small booth where out lovely server greeted us with a smile and joy. Had a great bottle of Chianti. Ordered the toasted ravioli for the appetizer. It was good, but just not my thing. For my entree I ordered from the seasonal menu. Roasted garden vegetable quinoa salad with grilled salmon. Got the balsamic glaze and lemon juice on the side. Wish I took a picture of this because it was delicious!!! One of the best pieces of salmon I have had in a very long time. Was served in a bowl with mixed greens, sweet potatoes, goat cheese, pecans, peppers & the dressings on the side (didn't even need them). The salmon was flaky and just so amazing. I was craving salmon so it was a great choice. Didn't give 5 stars only cause I'm not a big fan of italian in general.",

The lasagna was huge and very cheesy. My only complaint is that I wish it had a little bit more sauce. My fiance thought it was just right.

It's a bit tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Providence road, but once you find you way in, there's a pretty good chance you will find something delicious.  I love of comforting smell of Italian goodness and the warm feeling you get when you enter.  The space is interesting with a low ceiling and configuration since the building is older, but still makes for a cool mom and pop spot(in my opinion).  Don't have the history of this place, but you can tell it was passed down from a generation and dedicated to family loved ones.  This place always is busy when I go, which is a good sign.  The waitstaff is super friendly and always on the move due to the place being busy, but you never leave hungry.  Place is very family friendly.  Definitely fun to see kids enjoy pizza and pasta as much as I do.",

    "text": "This was our first time at Zio and over the years I had only heard amazing things. My husband, son and I got there at about 6:30. We were seated immediately, however it took about 5-10 mins before anyone came to the table. Our waiter was brand new and had tables inside and out which You could tell had him a little flustered. We ordered a pizza for my son, lasagna and side salad for my husband and I ordered the meatball appetizer and side salad as my meal. The salads came out super fast and then we waited about 40 mins or so before anything else came out. In the meantime i stopped another waitress as I had not seen our waiter in quite some time and the table behind us who came about 30 minutes after us got there meatball appetizer within about five minutes of ordering. She must have grabbed the attention of our waiter as he stopped by a few minutes after and let us know he was sorry for the wait and the food would be out shortly. Finally the food came..The pizza was slightly warm and dried out, On the plus side, my husband's lasagna was a nice size and he enjoyed it. My meatball appetizer still was not brought out. Shortly after, the waiter brought over a plate of spaghetti and meatballs- not what I ordered! He took it back and about 10-15 mins later after apologizing he brought out the correct dish ..by then my husband and son were done eating. He did take the meatball off the bill and offered us a free dessert and 10% of the rest of our food. It was a nice gesture but still unfortunately a let down. To top it off a man rode his bike into the parking lot as we were leaving and asked us if he could have some of our leftover food... not the best ending to a $60 dollar meal with discounts, that's for sure:(",

My husband and I definitely enjoyed mapping out our most recent Italian vacation on the place mats they have on the tables!  Pro tip- Tuesday is 1/2 wine bottles. Our table split some Pinot Grigio and Prosecco.   Off of Yelper Tonya P's suggestion, we ordered a cheese pizza as a tizer. I honestly don't know if I would have done this if Tonya didn't encourage it. However, I now am going to recommend this to everyone! Order the cheese pizza. Not a bunch of rando toppings on it. Just cheese. It's that amazing.   I settled on a side ceasar salad and a side of meatballs. My husband got the special for the day, which was angel hair pasta with a butter/white wine sauce and loads of seafood (shrimp, scallops, etc). His pasta was fantastic!! The shrimp in it were the jumbo shrimp, not the wimpy baby ones! My meatballs were easily the highlight for me. The flavor was so perfect. Everyone around the table seemed very pleased with their dishes!   We decided to split a few desserts for the table. I tried a bite of the cannoli (excellent filling), a bite of the tiramisu, and a bite of this lemoncello cake (perfection!).   Absolutely fantastic evening that was made even better by service. Our waitress may have actually been the sweetest woman on the planet. No exaggeration. Zio will definitely become our go to Italian from here on out.",

I will be back the next time I'm in Charlotte (and most likely will have the bolognese again).",

We arrived for an early dinner, around 6:30, and got one of the last tables on the outside patio. Upon being seated we were greeted by our waiter, who was very friendly, and offered water and fresh bread, made at Nova's bakery. As we checked out the menu we observed a women working in their outside garden, where they grow herbs and vegetables, now that is fresh!  We started with the arugula salad, which was light and extremely fresh with arugula, asparagus and candied almonds. And, after seeing the other Yelp photos we decided to check out the classic cheese pie and a side of meatballs. The pizza, or pie as they call it, was amazing! The dough was cooked to perfection, with a light and fluffy crust, topped with just the right amount of cheese and herbs. As for the meatballs, OMG, they reminded me of my Italian grandmother's, served it a great marinara sauce.  The service was great, and although the restaurant is definitely old school it is a hidden gem with amazing Italian traditions. Cannot wait to get back and check out some of the entrees!",

Pizza thin crispy crust was strong on crispy but light on toppings. Sparse is the best description. Lasagna portion was ample. Sauce was watery. Layers of cheeses and meat were out of balance. Heavy on the noodles. Cheeses overpowered. Probably just an off night or at least bad night for take out.

They have gone up on their prices too which sucks. $11 for spaghetti and marinara - come on. I asked for extra sauce( because they never have ended enough, )  and they gave me a tiny side cup. Gee thanks. Totally not worth the $",

    "text": "First of all, can't believe I've never been to this cozy, little Italian restaurant in all the years I've lived in the Queen City! Thanks to being July's choice destination for Yelp's International Supper Club, I was finally able to check out this hidden gem.  This month's gathering was rather big, with maybe 15-16 members...but the restaurant had a perfect seating arrangement for us all by the wall.   We were served several big bowls and trays of Italian faves...starting with their amazing Cheese Pizza, followed by a little bit of everything! Since our host preordered various items off the menu and served up family-style, I'm not sure about the exact names...but there were 2 varieties of Pasta, Meatballs, Chicken, and Canoli. And even a bowl of Salad! All I can say is, YUM...for each and every item ordered!   And OH, I loved their \"Italian Mule\" mixed drink. Highly recommended!  I do think the restaurant could use a bit more space though. There seating area was a bit tight in the dining half of the restaurant...and it sort of has a closed-in (caved in?) feel to it.  Also, the AC could have been cranked up a bit more.  Still, the restaurant did a great job bringing out the foods so quickly and seamlessly...and big kudos to Tonya for putting this delightful feast together!   Afterwards, one of the waiters even gave our group a guided tour of their backyard garden.   Any fan of good, homestyle Italian food is sure to love Zio. It's all SO Delicioso!!",

We started off with a cheese pizza appetizer. Yes, pizza as an app and it was delicious. Nice, thin crust and flavorful sauce. Winner.  We then tried the house salad. I'm not a fan of croutons but I was told theirs were quite good. Afterwards, plates of meatballs, penne alla vodka, maria rigatoni, and chicken piccata followed. Out of all of those plates, my favorite was the chicken piccata. The lemon wasn't heavy handed and it made the chicken fresh-tasting and flavorful. Definitely would order again on my next visit.   As a bonus, we got a tour of their backyard garden to see where some of their ingredients come from. Service was great, they kept our tables clear and drink full.",

I like that I can wear either jacket and slacks, or a nice pair of shorts and sandals--both styles fit here.  Thanks!  I attended with a group of Yelper's as part of their International Supper Club.  The service was flawless for about 20 of us, as well as the food, which was served family style.  We started with pizza and ended with cannolis.  In between we gorged ourselves silly on salad, chicken picatta, meatballs, penne in a vodka sauce, and rigatoni in a cream sauce with mushrooms and spinach.  Wowzer, we ate well!  Afterwards, we had a private tour of their garden area out back.  I think Uncle Duff would be proud of the way we were treated tonight.  Ringing lots of bells on my \"give 'em a whirl meter.\"   Looking for an authentic \"gioia di verve?\"  Go here.  Molte grazie!",

I ordered the friend calamari and it was just cooked perfectly lightly breaded and not at all chewy just the way it's supposed to. I had the chicken piccata and just was so enjoyable, chicken was nice and tender and the white wine sauce was really good. Did I mention that thier pasta is homemade? If I didn't my bad because it is and your can tell by the texture there is no way on Earth it's store bought boxed crap Zios really knows how to make great food all around and just can't wait to come back for more!",

We were quickly greeted and seated our drinks were brought out promptly we were then informed that the restaurant ran out of bread. We were very surprised because it was still quite early in the evening and most Italian restaurants have bread brought to the table while you wait on your entree. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan which was okay and he ordered the salmon piccata his salmon was under cooked and had to be sent back to the kitchen which of course made for an awkward dining experience since the point of eating out is so that we can eat together. When the salmon returned it was still under cooked so instead of sending it back again my date opted to suffer through his meal and had to eat around the salmon. When we left the restaurant he ended up throwing away his food and was upset about paying for a meal that he could not enjoy. Perhaps we should have requested a refund for his entree. On a positive note our server and the staff were very friendly.",

We waited to get table bread for 10 minutes after ordering our entrees until finally we just asked our waitress who didn't even speak fluent English for bread. Otherwise who knows if the bread would have shown up before the entrees. Later, both of us asked for to go containers and she showed up with only one. Rather than wait for her to make her rounds and show up with another to go box, I just went up to the hostess and got one so we could finally get out of there. Dinner should not have taken that long.",

Don't be like me. :)   When I arrived there was already fresh bread and dips on the table. I'm a fan because they bring you two loaves of bread to start. Carbs are the way to my heart! I loved the red sauce that comes out for dipping! So good!   For dinner I ordered the toasted ravioli and a meatball. The ravioli was just okay. I missed the filling and expected them to be a little hotter fresher from the kitchen. My friend said they were normally not as skimpy so perhaps I just had a bad batch.   But the meatball was really good! I loved the flavors and the sauce. I could have just ordered these and been happy!   Overall, it's A-OK in my book. And I'd be willing to give them another try!",

I started with the fried goat cheese salad- note you can have them split it for you. The goat cheese was delicious and the perfect starter to any meal. I would definitely come back just to order the salad.   We decided to split a pizza. We did a BYO with the white pizza, but added chicken and artichokes. It was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Next time I'll definitely get a pizza down the traditional route, but the white pizza sold me.  Zio is a great place for a casual night out and the staff is super friendly. I will definitely be back in the near future.",

We had a group of nine for dinner on a Monday night. They don't really take reservations, but if you have a large group go ahead and call ahead to give them the heads up you're coming.   Yelper Tonya P has told me for years, make sure to get a plain cheese pizza as an appetizer when you go to Zio. Pretty good rule of thumb in Charlotte: listen to Tonya when it comes to food. We got two for the table and man, they were delicious. I would've never thought to order a plain cheese pizza here, let alone getting one as an app to share. Tonya for president. For my entree, I ordered the seafood pasta from the specials board. It was delicious and had a good amount of quality seafood in it. We also ordered cannolis, tiramisu, and lemoncello cake. The lemoncello cake was my favorite. I needed more than a couple bites, so I also got one to go.   On Mondays and Tuesdays, they do half price bottles of wine. Make sure to take note of the ones that qualify, look for the selections with the asterisk. Or, just clarify with your server ahead of time because not only bottles are on special.   Good food, great company and what made the evening even better- our server. Our ticket said her name was Deborah (so I hope I'm giving credit to the proper person) and she was just amazing. She took great care of us and was just fabulous to be around all evening.   Zio, I'm sorry it took me this long to come visit. I'll definitely be back. Get a cheese pizza ready for me!",

I haven't been since my last review so decided to come back for a try.  I brought my mom & my nephew and we arrived about 5:30.  We were greeted and seated right away.  Our waiter's name was Tim and he was exceptionally friendly and prompt.   I ordered the stuffed eggplant parm and a beet/fries goat cheese salad. The meal was delicious. The salad was decent although the dressing was a little on the sour side. I tasted one of my mom's meatballs and it was very good.

We had a group of 9 and they accommodated us without a problem and kept up with great service the whole time we were there.  As a Jersey girl, I judge my Italian restaurants by the quality of their cheese pizza... and man, it did not disappoint! Thin (but not Napoli thin) crust.. not hard or burnt, just crispy, and the cheese.. oh my goodness the cheese... melting right off the slice. YUM!  I then ordered the Spinach and Beans entree which was mildly healthy compared to other choices haha. It was well flavored and very fresh. Zio has a garden outside that they pick many of their ingredients from, which is very cool.   We ended our meal by splitting some cannoli's and a lemoncello cake with a raspberry drizzle. Again, very well made.  Definitely will be returning again!",

We then got our bill ($44) and included a credit card along with $30.  The server took it without listening to us and came back with change and the card.  We explained we wanted her to run $14 on the card.  She took the card back, then proceeded to take an order on the phone as well as chat with the bartender.  Once I made a comment to the owner, we finally got our bill thrown to us as she stormed off.  There are plenty of restaurants that need our business.  Obviously, this is not one of them.

We went again on a Saturday night with a slightly larger party and the service was a bit more absentee, seemed a bit more rushed, but honestly was not bad.  The prices are so reasonable, some dishes just under $10, most not over $20,  especially considering the quality of the food.  The ambiance is a bit on the casual side but really this is a superb Italian restaurant, great for a fun date or a family outing.  If you're not trying to pay extra for a dark secluded corner (not a lot of those here to be honest) then there's no reason to go anywhere else for delicious, reasonable Italian.",

    "text": "If Yelp  had 1/2 stars this would be a one and a half.  I reserve 1 stars for places that I truly dislike.  This restaurant I just kind of felt sorry for.  Nothing that the \"slick\" old family feeling that their menu invokes came through.  Maybe after all this is just a good pizza restaurant.  I had spaghetti with sea food sauce, a small salad, and club soda. No bread was forth coming.  This came to $19.50.  The only thing good about the pasta was that it was cooked  well not over or under but al dente.  The sauce which had a few sprigs of spinach , a few shrimp , a number of unidentified little balls of something that did not look like any sea food that I was familiar with and one, count 'em up folks, one piece of squid.  The marinara  sauce was bland. watery, and boring as hell.  They need to move up one shelf at the Harris Teeter.  I was shown to a table in the back room where the constant chatter of the wait staff centered on mostly last nights date, last weeks party etc. Noisy!.  I was never asked whether my food was satisfactory how I felt about world peace, or any thing for that matter.  This place in my estimation has little idea of the basics of restaurant hospitality.  When I finished my main course I was handed my check. No questions i.e. How was is it? would you care for dessert? How about some coffee? Don't get me wrong. No one was rude. A pleasant woman up by the door thanked me for coming and hoped I would be back.  I will think very seriously about that -- but at this point it doesn't look likely.",

    "text": "We had dinner last night at Zio and overall I wasn't very impressed.  We started with bread which was nice and crusty but was served with  cold sauce ...heated up would have been much tastier.   Our server took our order but wasn't very friendly - and apparently forgetful. Five minutes later another server asked us what our entrees were again. I ordered a salad with my meal ,but eventually it became clear she forgot to bring it out. When I asked her about it again, she goes \"oh you wanted it in the beginning? - it's ready now its just sitting back there.\" No, I want my caesar to sit back there sopped in dressing so the romaine becomes wilted. She then brought out my salad and meal together ...but my roommates salad was brought out shortly after. If it is a meatless salad there really isn't an excuse not to bring them out together.   My salad was good -the dressing was clearly homemade, and the lettuce luckily still crisp. My roommate also liked her salad. My pasta dish (which was a special), tasted just ok. I am picky when it comes to good italian, but I felt that the tomato cream sauce was watery and the dish seemed more like something from a chain like TGI Fridays (covered in un-melted cheese  - veggies cut very small - sparce ingriedients that didn't seem to be high quality).   The meal was big and the price was fairly inexpensive ($16 for salad and pasta dish). - 1 star for lackluster entree -1 star for poor service.",

My friend and I sit at the bar because John the bartender is stellar, cool and fun and his recommendations (wine and food) are great. The chicken parmesean was perfect..flavorful, I'm not sure which one I liked more the chicken parm or veal Marsala. The veal was succulent w the sweet Marsala sauce. The  chicken parm spot on. Zio is a great neighborhood restaurant where you'll feel welcome. Come hungry and ull leave full and you should enjoy ur dining experience as its very comfortable !",

Desserts have gone downhill - most recent cannoli was terrible.   Service has seemed really slow the past few times we've been. There isn't a reason a pizza dinner should be 2+ hrs long - it was very frustrating, this place may turn into a takeout only choice.",

But my husband got a pear gorgonzola pizza that was awesome. We both ended up eating his pizza! The pizzas are very big, so one is all you need for two people and you'll probably end up still taking some home. Which is great because it makes a delicious lunch, even cold. Good service, friendly staff. It was a little cold the night we were there, so take a sweater.",

However, last time I had it, the meatballs had slipped in quality .. would prefer one that was high quality rather than two of average quality.  The salad remains good, and house dressing is good.  Portions large enough you take home for another meal (for many of the entree's).  Very family friendly, nice enough atmosphere, although the most recent time the booth was under repair and not comfortable. I would say it was better a year ago, but that's subjective. Hope it survives and thrives, as it is a nice family alternative Italian chain operations.  They tend to separate the families with kids from the others, they have two dining spaces.  That's good.  The salad wedge is wonderful, try that if you haven't. Not cheap, however.",

Zio was good, accommidating, comfy. Our annoying questions and distracted ordering were handled with aplomb. The bruschetta puree was, I'm assuming, intentionally chilled, and I dug.   Thanks, TR, for getting us here - tucked away where it is, I'd probably have never made it here on my own. Parking looks like it could get rough but there's another lot next to the one directly in front of Zio, so I imagine you could stick your vehicle there in a pinch.",

The bartender was GREAT, there were lots of open seats, and there was a baseball game on the flatscreen in the corner.  There's bread to start with a choice of butter or red pepper pesto, which tasted like marinara to me.  We both ordered salads and pasta dishes.  My companion cleaned both his plates and said the lasagna was very good.  I ordered a avocado, tomato, and mozarella salad special which was DELICIOUS.  I also got the baked ziti, which was nicely seasoned and huge enough that I ate it for dinner the two nights afterwards too.  The food was moderately priced for the quality.  Another shout out to the bartender is well deserved.  He was attentive without being overbearing and was great to chat about baseball with.  He also deftly handled the bar customers and all the take-out orders.  I didn't catch his name, but I get the feeling he's there a lot and his long ponytail makes him pretty identifiable.  Long story short: go to Zio!  Tasty food and friendly staff.",

It is a nice little place, feels very \"homey\", and comfortable!  Menu looked great, as well as the specials that our server let us know about. For my first time here I wanted to stick with something simple so I could get a feel for the place. At our table, 1 ordered the Mahi Mahi special, we got a grilled sausage & pepper pizza, some penne with sausage, and a chicken parm. Everyone really liked their food! The pizza was great, loved the slight char from the grilling. Nice thin crust. Mahi was very good, risotto it was served on was very good as well. The food was all fantastic.  The reason I am only giving 3 stars is that the service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly, laid back, and \"chill\", saying \"dude\" and other dead surfer terms. His big downfall wasn't his lingo though believe it or not. He chose to not write down anything for a table of 6, and it showed. He came back to the table 2x to confirm who had ordered what. Then he put our pizza in wrong, and had to run to the kitchen and tell them the correct pie. THEN when it came time for the checks, he had everything mixed up, some peoples entrees on other peoples checks. He was very nice and friendly, but didn't seem to have it all together.  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, because again, the food was fantastic. Just hoping I get another server next time!",
