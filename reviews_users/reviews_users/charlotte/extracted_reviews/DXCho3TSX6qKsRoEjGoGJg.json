When I walked in the restaurant, (they have two entries, not sure which one is the \"main\" entry) one waiter was at the bar \"filtering\" with a female customer.  The waitress and a bus boy were talking by the register.  They all saw me and just decided whatever they were doing was more important than greet me and seat me at a table.  The restaurant was not busy by the way.  Finally the female waitress took an excruciating move and left the conversation and sat me.  I order two entree all by myself (I was very hungry and this Asian can eat).  I had a burrito and enchilada.  There were both ok, not bad, but not spectacular.  I could probably went to Chipotle got a good burrito with no bad service.  Definitely will not go back again, I will stick with Chipotle.",

    "text": "I really, really like this place.  I've been to Charlotte two weeks in a row for business.  On the first trip I discovered Zapata's by accident.  On the second trip I came back because I liked the first meal so much.  Situated on a small man-made lake in a modern mixed development, you can enter the upper entrance (which is more strip-mall esque) or from the patio on the water (which is a little more unique feeling).  I have eaten inside downstairs (which felt cave-like in a very cozy way) and upstairs on the deck (which was delightful).    I've ordered the Tacos Al Carbon and Tacos De Cerdo Al Horno.  Both dishes came with crumbled queso fresco on top, a simple yet clever garnish that made my food look EVEN MORE DELICIOUS.  Both dishes came with a side of a very unique pico de gallo: rather than diced vegetables, this was made from delicately thin strips of onions and peppers.  In addition to the flavor being top-notch, the presentation and mouth-feel was unique - I wish all places made their pico like this.  The top-shelf margarita, curiously always on sale, was very good.  Nothing particularly special, just a good margarita.  The Tacos Al Carbon were good, but not nearly as good as the De Cerdo Al Horno.  Amongst hundreds of meals at mexican places over my life thus far, the carnitas taco things stand out.  Way out.  And finally, with your check comes a complimentary dessert: a sweet fried tortilla topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream, drizzled in honey.  GO HERE NOW.",

I think this is due to the fact that the only other location I know of is in Ballantyne and things tend to be a bit elevated whenever you go to that end of town.  There's a decent lunch menu offered to go with the complementary chips and salsa - which was awesome.  I'm a huge cilantro fan and you can tell they make their salsa fresh (not out of the bottle).  I had a chicken taco salad and was surprised at how big the lunch portion was.  It was packed full of chicken and the sour cream and guacamole was off to the side so you can choose to make your salad \"even healthier\" if desired.  Service was great and quick.... definitely a great spot for lunch and I am assuming a good spot for dinner as well.",

I ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese. The thing was loaded with rice and lettuce, save for a few carrots, peas, and corn here and there. There was no seasoning, or none noticeable. It's wasn't all bad though, at least the ingredients were fresh and not over/under cooked.

They have huge portions and a variety of food to choose from. They are a tiny bit more pricey than other restaurants of their type but they are worth it for their quality of food.

    "text": "I should've just gone to Taco Bell or Monterrey. After hearing rave reviews from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican friends, I finally got the opportunity to eat here last night.   I arrived around 9:30pm and was sat instantly. we were the only party in the upstairs part. My friend, who is Mexican, chose to get the rice water (forgot the original name) and it was delicious! Chips and Salsa was plentiful, I didn't care for the salsa at all. Tasted bland and watered down to me. The chips were obviously out the bag, which I don't mind but some salt or some seasoning was needed.   I ordered the Street Tacos and my friend got the Shrimp Fajitas. He loved his fajitas! Now, my Street Tacos on the other hand is a completely different story. The tortillas/soft taco shells were greasy and cold. I couldn't even eat them. The items inside the taco weren't that great either. Huge strips of chicken that tasted bland, barely there pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of cheese. There was lettuce and guac on the side. I also asked for sour cream on the side to try to make it taste good. It also came with rice and beans. The beans were beans, nothing special. The rice was the best part of the meal... but it was room temperature which I didn't like much.  Service is the reason why I will never give the food another chance. Our server was Ingrid. She was pretty great at first. When a Spanish speaking couple came to sit upstairs, she began talking to them so me and my friend had to wait about 10 minutes for the check once we were done eating. Then, she assumed the checks were together and seemed to have a shocked look on her face when I asked to get them split. We had to wait about another 10 minutes for her to finish talking to her manager/co-worker. The thing that that really put the icing on the cake was seeing a charge for sour cream. I wouldn't have minded if I knew when ordering sour cream with my tacos that there would be an extra charge, but to me that is just Serving 101 to tell a customer that all add ons were extra. Paying $1.25 to attempt to make the tacos taste a little bit better was ridiculous. When asked about it she told me, \"All add ons have a charge to the ticket\". No attempt to atleast say, \"I'm sorry, but sour cream has a charge.\" I just don't like being surprised when the ticket comes. There was a man, maybe the expo manager or kitchen manager that refilled our chips, salsa, and drinks. I'm not the greatest tipper, but I always tip 25-50% on inexpensive meals so I felt obligated to leave a note telling her that I would've tipped if I knew about the charge and if I could've got the ticket faster instead of watching her chit chat literally right in front of me while waiting for my ticket One of the first times in a while that I didn't tip. I'm in the service industry and I know that if I ever treated a customer like that, I would've gotten wrote up and had to have comped their meal out of my pocket.   Super long story short: Sub-par food, worse service.",

    "text": "Some friends and I were staying at the Hilton Charlotte University Place just on the other side of the lake and walked over to Zapata's for dinner on a Saturday night, around 8 PM. The restaurant was busy, but there was an empty table right inside the back door. I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat.  Fast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.  Food-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine. That said, if I was to end up back in this area, I doubt I'd return to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Bottom line 3.5 stars.  My date and I were greeted and seated promptly. The chips and salsa were delivered but the chip person made no effort to say hi or anything as they normally do in mexican restaurants.  It took quite a while for a server to get our drinks and it also took too long for them to actually get our drinks out. After that, however, the service was much better.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and my date ordered the fish tacos.   My plate was quite good...the fried shrimp tasted amazing I was surprised. The refried beans were also tasty.  The top shelf margarita had a good balance. Strong by flavorful.  I have to point out one quick detail in hopes management sees this.   After we were done eating and drinking I was going to use the restroom but a busboy ( the same guy who delivered the chips without a smile or a hello)  was sweeping the one toilet one urinal bathroom. He saw me and just kept doing his thing.  I ended up having to drive home to use the bathroom.   I would suggest they clean the bathrooms after all or most guests are done eating or at least allow the guest to use it.   The food was good the service could use some work, but overall not a bad spot.",

    "text": "Earlier tonight I had the pleasure of eating at a gem of a restaurant in the University Area of Charlotte, NC - Zapaata's Cantina Mexican Restaurant.  I have been eating at Zapata's since 2002, and like a fine wine, the place gets better with time.   We arrived around 7pm on a rainy Thursday evening.  (If you've never been to Zapata's in University Area before, it can be kinda tricky to locate.  It is in the back left of the plaza.)  When my date and I walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman host, who gave us the option of sitting upstairs or downstairs.  Since we've seen the place before, we chose to sit upstairs.    No sooner were we seated, when warm tortilla chips, and two bowls of fresh pico were placed before us.  Tecate was on special, so I gladly order one, my date ordered a coke that didn't taste quite right. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SODAS.)  Our drinks, including ice-cold water; were brought to us within minutes.  My drink came in a can, however it was accompanied with a frosted-mug and fresh lime.    I order the fajitas-burrito, my date ordered the (grilled) shrimp tacos.  Both orders arrived promptly and smoking hot to our table.   On my plate was a giant burrito stuffed with chicken and steak (I always get the mix), beans, cheese, peppers, and onions, etc.  The outside of the massive burrito was smothered in melted cheeses including guacamole and sour-cream which were splattered across the top.  The shrimp-tacos looked just as appealing.  Both entree's were brought to our tables on extremely hot plates. and were surrounded by warm refried-beans and yellow rice - cooked to perfection.    We both loved our meals.  We both had plenty to put in a box and take home for a late-night snack or lunch tomorrow.    There is much debate amongst life-long UCBers about which is the best Mexican restaurant in the University Area; with the contestants being Monterrey, Los Arcos, or Zapata's.  My nod goes to Zapata's by a smidgen over Monterrey!  Our Bill: 1 coke, 1 Tecate, 2 waters, 1 fajitas-burrito, 1 shrimp-taco = $30.00  Service:  The service is simply amazing.  I've probably been to Zapata's over 20 times, and even though I've have had a few not so tasty meals, the SERVICE has always been top-notch.   BEWARE OF:  **If you get the shrimp tacos, I recommend them grilled.  **Watch for the pulled-chicken.  It's not so tasty compared to the chicken-breast or steak.  **$2.25 Tecate cans on Thursday nights.  **You can get a steak/chicken mix with the burritos",

Our neighbors used to go there every Friday night but recently told us the service and food were becoming unacceptable, and they were looking for a new Friday night spot. Strangely, we had just eaten \"take out\" the night before and it tasted much different and lacked the quality we were accustomed to. We had a Living Social to them so decided to give them another shot. YIKES! Worse than ever, and the girl who took our order missed one of the meals, so my husband sat for a half hour without even being offered a beverage on the house. The enchiladas were poorly made and for the most part tasteless. Anyone have any suggestions for GOOD Mexican food in the Ballantyne/Pineville area?

    "text": "My very first review could only be that of Zapatas Cantina, or \"Zaps\" as I like to refer to it as.  I frequent this dining establishment more than any other in my life. Very much at the pinnacle of decent restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, it's modestly priced, and has a fresh atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- this place is not for you. I've heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best authentic, non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete lack thereof.   Now I myself usually don't deviate from an ace menu item once I've found it, and as such I've had the same \"Southwest Quesadilla\" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First thing I've ever ordered from 'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don't. I have only recently been \"around the block\" with other various items on the menu and to no shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite as well.  Overall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic \"kids\" to a \"make-your-own\" spin off anything they have to offer really, 4) generous portion sizes, 5) full bar selection and quality margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out of 10). Can't beat it.  And for Cinco de Mayo? This is the place to be.",

We have both been getting sick since shortly after eating there and still are very sick. To start it was very hot in the section we wear sat in, were told it's because it's by the window, but don't see why they wouldn't make accommodations for that. Other ladies behind us were saying how hot it was, and they were both from Mexico,just saying. So we had to ask twice for a salsa, then we ordered ceviche to eat as an appetizer, and that was the worst decision ever. They did not offer it as an appetizer,which makes no sense to me. I still order the $25 item, to receive bland, limeless, saltless and all-around flavorless rubber and onions. Everything was severely overcooked and just plain bad in the ceviche. My main course wasn't much better. Everything was bland, dried out from sitting under a heat lamp, and the chicken looked like it came out of a wrapper. We ended up spending close to $100 altogether including tip, just to spend the next 24 hours in pain. This place has sadly become the worst Mexican food place ever,for me. We wish we had gone to McDonald's for our date night, rather than having gone there.",

The decor, music, food, everything is not like it is in Mexico, it's like you might think Mexico is like if you've only experienced Mexico from Epcot and old movies.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either...and there is A LOT of food.  So it's a great value if you're hungry and definitely edible.  They have a few items that aren't found in most such places so that's good, but I'd guess that if you wanted Mexican food it wouldn't matter if you chose this place or one of the other equivalent places around here.",

    "text": "My new coworkers invited me to go get \"cheap mexican\" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.  I won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.  I have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.  The only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \"cheap\" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks.",

I asked two different waiters questions about the coupon which were, \" What is the amount of appetizer is free?\" and Can we use 3 coupons on 3 separate checks?\" The answers were, $8.95 limit & yes to separate checks. We ordered our food and got our checks to go. They charged us for the appetizer(s) and told us that it is only a free appetizer when you purchase @ meals. The coupon read no such limitations. The manager and myself argued for 20 minutes. I told him to contact someone else because I wasn't paying because it said FREE. I asked the two waiters about me asking them questions and they said I never asked them anything. I sat there with my kids, sister and mom and waited for the police to come (which they never came.) Needless to say my meal was free and m mother paid because she didn't want to argue. The manager spoke in Spanish to the employees and would not translate what he said when I asked him too... I will NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN and DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

It took a few days to finish my leftovers in the hotel, but I was determined not to waste that.  Even cold, it was just as tastey, for me, that is the True test of how good a dish can be, if its gross cold, then you shouldn't have ordered it or cooked it in the first place.  This location is in a university type mall/plaza, hadn't been there in years and not too much has changed.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, I highly reccomend eating here for a bite when ever and where ever you may be in Charlotte.   The service was great, friendly and just smelling the food cooking, just made you want to eat everything.",

We were seated right away, and given 2 large baskets of tortilla chips for our party of 5. I really like how they give us our own bowl of salsa per person, double dipping time! The restaurant wasn't too crowded, so service was fairly good. I had just landed from SFO, so wanted to unwind with my jack and coke. Others ordered the huge frozen margaritas that were very tasty! Very addicting!  We ordered guacamole, which came in a huge molcajete, those stone looking bowls. Lots of guac but a bit bland for my taste, had to add salt to my portion.   Flipped through their book of a menu, and everything is fairly cheap! I wanted variety so went for the chicken tamale, ground pork enchilada, and chile releno with refried beans and mexican rice. All this for $10! And the plate was huge!!! The enchilada was bleh, tamale was decent, but was blown away that their chile releno was so tasty. It's really hard to find a good one, but this chile not only had a kick to it, but lots of cheese.  Coworkers also all enjoyed their dishes for the most part. The food is good, but not out of this world. Towards the end of dinner, service was...gone. I waited 10 minutes for another jack and coke, and he totally forgot so had to ask another guy. It basically came as my dessert as we were all done. They do give a mini dessert to all, fried crispers with whipped cream on top and a bunch of cinnamon.  Decent tasting food and huge portions for a very low price.",

The beans were not flavored well, but the rice was good. Portion sizes are large. Margaritas are pretty watered down (mine tasted like straight sour which sucks for $9). Our server was okay - she didn't regularly check on us and had no answer for why we didn't get guac with our tacos. The (upstairs) patio is nice, though needs some attention - it was fairly dirty. (They have three patios btw). Bathrooms were not stocked. Prices were slightly too much for what you get.",

Placed our order and we got our drinks, we took a few min after we got our drinks to order our food. We waited about 20 min to order and we had to call someone over to take our orders, the original waitress went home i guess.  The new waitress had an attitude and seemed as if we were bothering her. The soup i usually order ,tortilla soup was not the same. We get the check and the drinks are not the price that was quoted by the original waitress. To make a long story short, she refused to honor the price quoted the reason we ordered the drinks in the first place!! Service was horrible!!

She half-assed wiped it away.  She only gave us two menus when there were three of us. I got up and picked up a menu from the counter.  It was so gross on the inside.  Food was on it.  I should have left then.  No stupid me stayed.  As we waited for our food I was looking around.  I see a spider web between my booth and the one behind us.  Do they ever clean this place?  This makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. I will never go back or recommend this place.  I'm sorry I wrote this but I like its important to let others know.",

Now for the average American yea this place is ok. But I felt deeply dishonored when I ordered the quesadilla and got something that looks worst than a quesadilla from taco bell which I can buy for 1$ and yet they charged me 10$. If your looking for REAL Mexican food. Don't go here. They need a new chef or at least someone who cares.",

I had the beef fajitas and it had way too much seasoning and tasted like cinnamon more that fajita seasoning. It also took a fairly long time to get my food as well. This place has done better and can do better, so I hope they can fix the problems. I will give this restaurant another try in a few months, but for now I would say go for the drinks instead of the food.",

Manager then chased us saying that we didn't pay for the items that we'd just told him about, to create a dramatic affect.   I didn't appreciate the dramatics after he'd just brushed me off as if service wasn't important. Not to mention, the waitress then made it a point that we could just enter a tip on our bill!

The restaurant itself is nicely laid out and well maintained. We arrived after any dinner rush they may have had so we were seated immediately as there was only one other party in the restaurant at the time...it was relatively late...like 8pm.  Now the oddness that causes them to lose a few stars...the service! We were catching up and not ready to order our food immediately so the server hovered right over us even though we said we needed more time. So he just stood like two feet away and hovered. So awkward. So we ordered, we ate, and then he hovered waiting for the bill to be paid. I'd not put in my credit card and he picked up the bill twice. DUDE! We are not ready! No one else is here! CHILL!! And lastly, despite his never being more than a few feet away, hovering over us, we had to continually ask for refills. I'd come back in a pinch, but this definitely won't be making it to my list of great places to catch up with an old friend.",

We came here for lunch over the weekend craving some Mexican food. We walked in at 3:05p but our server let us order off of the lunch menu, very cool. Lunch menu items are basically half price. They also serve complimentary chips and salsa too! The chips are seasoned and crunchy. I wasn't a fan of the salsa since I like chucks spicy salsa. El torito is better in this sense.   He also let us sub Mexican rice and refried beans as sides, a second score. We ended up ordering a chicken chimichanga and spinach quesadilla which came out to $15 before tip., pretty sweet deal considering the amount of food. My boyfriend like the chimichanga though there should have been more cheese inside of it. My spinach quesadilla was good too, but not the best light option. It was a little too heavy for me as the spinach filling is pretty creamy and greasy. This would be a good drunk munchies food especially on the $4 margarita college days.   We will be back especially for lunch. They also have a punch card too! Get 10 lunches and get the next free! Hopefully they have some salad on the menu too lol",

The second time though, i went with three other people and we decided to sit at the outside tables. Only two of us were drinking from the bar menu. But we didn't want to sit at the bar because it was so packed and one of the people i was with was not 21. So, we only asked for 1 menu. The waitress seemed bothered because of that. So, she never came back and another waitress took her spot. After that, the manager/host came out to our table and directly said \"what are you doing? are you guys eating?\" He was very rude and cold. I said \"we are just ordering from the bar menu, is that ok? Is that a problem?\" He said \"no\" and walked away. Maybe they assumed that we were just there for free chips or something, but that was not the case. If so, they should have been honest and we would have understood. We made the mistake of staying there, instead of getting up and leaving after that remark he made. It made all of us feel very uncomfortable/unwelcome. we paid, left a tip and left.  The service was so unprofessional/unpleasant. You shouldn't treat people like this, and i'm never giving this place my money again.",

The building could use an update and maybe a little more care with the food to bring it up to yesteryear's standards.  The location is great, right off of Catawba, tucked away in a strip mall that has also seen better days.  The hostess who sat us and our wait staff were very friendly and helpful.  The waiters were very attentive and asked us many times if we had needs.  Thus, the 4th star!  Our meal was good.  We had shrimp tacos and beef chimichanga dinner.  My daughter thought the chimichanga wasn't crisp enough, but I loved it.  The shrimp tacos were good, not great.  The prices were reasonable and the salsa was fresh and delicious.  A good deep clean and a perk up from chef, and this place will be back up to 5 stars in no time!",

My food was a little bit bland I got tostadas and an empanada with both with chicken but my tostada supposed to have avocado, and it did not. Also our waitress paid a little to no attention to us the entire time she serves the other tables that could speak Spanish and ours could not, therefore we had to wait quite a bit to receive the service. One of my friends wanted some water, and it took the lady almost 5 minutes to see us even though she was at the table right next to us. My mom's food was FANTASTIC she had shrimp with Mexican rice, black beans and something else I can't remember. I wish I could say better things.",

She immediately said, \"no, only salad,\" and immediately asked my husband for his order. It seemed that she was in a rush, grabbed the menus and ran. I really wanted rice with my meal, but felt like I never had a chance to ask. The food was some of the best Mexican food me and my husband have had. Another girl kept our drinks and chips filled.

Paul is a big fan of chips and salsa but he did not like the salsa at Zapata's. It didn't have a lot of flavor other than tomatoes and pepper. We ordered the cheese dip, which we liked better; it was very thick and cheesy. Paul got the Burrito Texana and I got the Enchilada de la Crema. After the disappointing salsa, I'm happy to say that we both really enjoyed our entrees. The beef in Paul's burrito was very good and my Enchilada was supposed to have a sour cream sauce but it seemed more like a cheese sauce to me (which is perfectly okay!) We sat outside in the heat but service was good and our waters were kept full.",

He ordered quesadilla & I ordered the pollo fundido, the food cane out rather quickly but the taste was mediocre at best. The kitchen was extremely stingy with their salad, the rice had 0 flavor, & the beans were okay. My BFs quesadillas were slightly burned but they were edible. The chicken that came with my order tasted old, had no flavor & they literally slapped a few slices of American cheese on top.   The service here was horrible, our waiter didn't check on us once after we received our (sadly made) food. It took us about 15 minutes to flag him down so we can get our check.   Really disappointed with this place, I had higher hopes for this restaurant. You are better off going to Don Pedro's which is less then 10 minutes from this establishment.",

    "text": "Good texas-mexican food, good location near the Boardwalk Lake. But...  Bad #1: Bad Communication: Bad communication between waiters and management. We were interrupted multiple times because the waiters were lost and didn't know whose food was whose.   Examples: A waiter put two drinks and a dessert on our table without 1st asking us if it was ours. They actually belonged to the table next to us and the couple watched as it happened. The insane thing is, that we were still eating with a full plate of food. lol FAIL.  Bad #2: Restaurant Ran Out of a Vital Item Or Lying: When we got our dessert (which we were thankful for), they gave us an incomplete dessert. I asked, where is the chocolate? The lead waitress said, \"We ran out.\" and walked away. Professional restaurants should not have this problem. Hopefully she wasn't just being lazy or lying because of the rushing.  Bad #3: Customers Forgotten A. We didn't receive or weren't offered any beverage/water refills, the whole hour we had been there. That should be the standard of a waiter or restaurant. Do they a expect a mucho tip, from that?  B. We ran out of chips. We asked for some, the lady never came back. We had to ask a different person. We weren't even sure who our official waiter was actually, because of all of the confusion.  Bad #4: No care. The waiter didn't ask what type of rice we wanted. Plain or Mexican. They just gave us Mexican. No time or attention to see what we needed.  Bad #5: Bad Timing on Execution We sat down and 2 minutes later, the waitress asked if we were ready, as we were still looking at the menu. Very laughable. Their menu is huge.  Maybe I'm complaining too much about small things but I've experienced better. Advice, get new management and a better employee trainee program because they are obviously weak in the service department. Now you have a restaurant full of stubborn, possibly incompetent workers, who probably won't ever change.  Won't be going again, unless the manager apologizes to everyone on here. Well that won't be happening, because obviously \"no comprende\" communication and social media.",

We stopped in last night after a 49ers Men's soccer match (beat Elon, 1-0). My son wanted to go to Dish, but Plaza Midwood is 20 minutes away at best, and it was 9:00 PM. \"Whaddaya want, Trev?\" \"Nachos!\"   Well, he wasn't disappointed, even if he didn't get to pick the 'rant. They started us off with their usual never-see-the-bottom trays of chips and salsa. You really do have to be careful with these, because you can ruin your appetite for dinner by filling up on warm, crunchy tortilla chips and hot, complexly flavored salsas!  Restraint was worth it.  I had a wonderful Pollo Asado Burrito (very healthy chicken and veggies with a tomatillo sauce over it all). My wife had the La Union Chimichanga, which she loved. Portion sizes were HUGE, so we ate lunch off of our dinners the next day.   The boys got what they wanted. My \"all American twin\" got his usual chicken fingers and fries, and his brother got a taco, rice, and beans.  They have decent draft beer, and various daily drink specials, so if you're thirsty for relaxation, get something from the bar.  This is probably my second or third favorite Mexican restaurant in town. We go here, because it is close to us. I love Cantina 1511 on East Blvd, and Las Margarita on Independence near Sharon Amity, too.  That said, this place is flavorful, consistent, and the service is great. They also have some interesting and colorful decor. Occasionally, they'll add live entertainment, too.   Check out their online menu at:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zapatasrestaurant.com%2F&s=537e6f324b9b92c21db44cf27586cf9ef2cb903f08153b4c69addc0759e76034\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">zapatasrestaurant.com</a>",

    "text": "Was taken here for a work lunch the other day.  The food was reasonably tasty but unexciting.  When I order carnitas, I expect meat that's been cooked to extreme tenderness, not big chewy pork chunks.  Rice and beans were just OK, and normally I'll hoover up every black bean on my plate, but I felt no compulsion to finish them.  The nopales salad on the side was tasty, and the salsa that came with everything was yummy, as others have mentioned.  My companions seemed pretty happy about their fish tacos, so maybe I'll try those if I get brought back here again.    I'd say, don't go here expecting anything other than lightly spiced totally Americanized Mexican food. It's not bad for what it is, but the whole experience, food and ambiance, seems designed to be nonthreatening to middle-aged white people. If I want that kind of experience, Cantina 1511 does it way better.  And since I live a few hundred yards from some of Charlotte's real Mexican and Salvadoran holes-in-the-wall, I'd probably give Zapata's a pass if I were the one picking the restaurant.",

It was more vegetables and red sauce, which I think is just ketchup and barbecue sauce. We got a margarita pitcher, and it tasted like there was not much alcohol in it. I can't shake the feeling this restaurant cheats its customers, and I'll be looking at other Mexican restaurants in the area before considering here again.",

    "text": "Decent food, good drink specials and real fish tacos! Similar to other Spanish restaurants, they have Taco Tuesdays and Margarita Mondays I think? It might be Friday actually....I'll get back to you on that.   I normally go through two baskets of chips and three cups of salsa all by my lonesome. That's a good sign. The rice and beans are always consistently well made. Enchiladas are okay, but street tacos are a yessir.   While they offer authentic beer battered Baja style fish tacos on either flour or corn tortillas, they sometimes lack flavor. A little sprinkle of salt will solve that problem! Substitute corn over flour tortillas and you will have an epiphany. Cheers to corn tortillas!",

If you know the real deal, you don't patronize a crappy representation! I especially love the rice and beans, the cheeses (and the generous amount of cheeses!!!) and the beer. Did I mention the chicken dishes are all quite good. Have not tried the beef and fish entrees- yet.",

I smothered everything in salsa and jalapeno cheese dip, which helped, but it should be delicious enough on its own. I've had much better at the same price.",

The queso dip is really good too!. I haven't ventured far from the quesadillas so I cant tell you much about the rest of menu but I can say that they have great quesadillas with generous portions and you can't go wrong no matter what you try. The steak quesadilla is my favorite by far. I have tried a few other dishes and I haven't found something I don't like, and since Mexican isn't my favorite type of food, that's saying a lot. They also have fantastic Margaritas! I don't like overly surgary ones like the ones in super markets and this is far from it. Very fresh tasting with a good balance of flavors. Overall, great place with great food and a good atmosphere. They recently redid the entire inside of the restaurant and it was a well deserved upgrade that made this place even better than before.",

We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation.
