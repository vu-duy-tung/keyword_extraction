The tacos were just so so, nothing special. The queso for the chips was nacho cheese. If you are thinking of going here Id highly consider salsaritas heck even Taco Bell over this place. If I had to name a positive I guess Id say the soda was good and cold? What a failure this place is.",

That's fine, I get building your brand, but maybe without an attitude. I got my order to go. I asked for no beans since I'm allergic and I still got beans. I gave my food to my roommate when I got home.. At least she approved!",

Check out their daily specials! The food was delicious and plentiful portions... have I mentioned the affordable prices? All natural/very fresh ingredients too. Can't beat that! The service was outstanding. It's so refreshing to go out someplace where the staff is friendly and helpful. I love it when I go somewhere and the people I interact can put a smile on my face. This is that place! The hot sauce bar is great. Tons of choices, self service and way better than any hot sauce I've had before and I LOVE hot sauce...I eat it on everything.  Thank you for the awesome service and amazing food last night guys. You guys definitely earned repeat customers and we will be sure to spread the word!",

No flavor whatsoever  The meal came with tortilla chips.  They lacked crunch as well as flavor.  Definitely not what I expect for Tex-Mex .  There was a hot sauce bar, but it was all bottled hot sauce, no fresh choices or salsa. There were TINY paper cups that held about a teaspoon of the sauce, definitely not user friendly for dipping.  After a few bites of cold flavorless food I left and headed over to Chipolte.  For 0.10 cents more I soon was enjoying a fresh flavorful warm steak burrito. The store was very clean and the employees were all very friendly.",

The food was awful and the service began to just be \"tijuana\" flat out annoying. Place was too rushed, salsa containers were WAY too tiny to dip the chips in, 90% of the salsas were WAY too runny and just gross. I could've made a better quesadilla blindfolded, tortilla shells weren't cooked well at all and instead tasted like cardboard. \"Blackened\" meat is just spices cooked on to add to the even more salty meal that you already have. Not to mention, the chips were terrible as well, salty AF. Don't waste your time or money. And P.S. their deals aren't really deals.. they are just overpriced to begin with.",

Every time I go to clean up after them, the staff insists that they will take care of it and not to worry. This location also offer free kids meals on the weekends (Concord Mills does NOT, FYI).

I prefer Chipotle's and Qdoba's right-in-front-of-you prep but okay...  Two of us had the Throwback Thursdaze special for $5.99. The other ordered tostitos (but she thought she was ordering a quesadilla).  The TT special consisted of a Tijuana burrito, chips, and a drink.  The burritos are customizable. I had mine in a hemp tortilla. Delicious.  The table we sat at was a rectangle for four. There was enough room on the table top but I felt like I could use a bit more elbow room between me and Sister One.  I was afraid of the famed hot sauce bar. Wussy old me tried ONE very mild sauce. The more daring Sister One tried a few of of the sauces including a Very Hot one. Sister Two and I laughed like loons at Sister One as she wiped her runny eyes and nose.  The staff checked on us every so often, offering refills on drinks, removing our trash, and asking if there was anything we needed.  A nice evening out and not a lot of money spent.  I'll go back.",

The food is served in nice portions. Nice as in just the right sized portion. I like chipotle and all, but their portion sizes will leave you feeling just about half past dead. But back to Tijuana flats, they have a nice sized menu, nice little beer selection (corona, Samuel Adams, Dos Equis , Foothills brewery etc etc). Their queso and nacho combination is really good to. Just be advised that their chips come litely salted and peppered to add more flavor. One last thing, Monday's and Wednesday, they have drink specials on just about all of their drinks. Just go!

I know, I know...A little drastic right? I'm sorry Tijuana and I hope you will accept this apology letter in the form of a Yelp review :).  At the Back to School Yelp event, we were gifted a 10 dollar credit that expired on October 31. I don't really visit the university area too often so it took me a while to use my gift card. I visited on a Thursday. Before planning my visit, I took a quick peek at the menu and had a couple of menu items in mind. I definitely like that the menu offers nutritional information. When I arrived, the cashier immediately informed me of the Thursday special, a burrito, chips, and a drink for 5.99. I considered the special but still kept in mind the menu items I thought about before I arrived. The cashier was totally patient with me. I asked a lot of questions and went back and forth with my decision. Finally, I  decided to get the chicken and bean tacos on a wheat tortilla. I made myself to the sauce bar and tried out the siracha hot sauce; it was delicious with just the right amount of spice to compliment the tacos. My refried beans were a bit too smooth for me. I like texture, so I welcome a few chunks and lumps in my food :). I was satisfied with the overall flavor of my meal and would definitely go back.  P.S. Tijuana sells wine and beer which definitely sets them apart from Taco Bell :). Drink specials vary.",

I order it JOLT style; jalepeno, onions, lettuce & tomatoes. It comes with a side of queso, guacamole and sour cream. The fajitas are crispy on the outside and full of Tex-Mex deliciousness on the inside. The meat is tender and flavorful. The toppings make my tummy happy ! I was even impressed that the University location offered teachers a FREE entree during winter break...WINNING! A big fan of this place...I'll definitely be a regular!",

One element of this place I really like is their hot sauce bar. There's a hot sauce for everyone's palate, and they pair great with the tacos and burritos. I recommend their burritos! Get them wet if you order them, you'll thank me later....",

The salsa is comes with is fresh and if you order extra chips, they are seasoned and you can make a full dinner or large lunch out of $9-10. It's vegetarian friendly and the staff at this location has been extremely nice and helpful. The one of Easy that closed was similar, but with poor management.   It could be much better, though. The guacamole tastes like a frozen brand and the sauces do not really compliment the food at all. Some of them taste good, but a unique salsa bar would make much more sense.",

I asked if that was before or after the discount. It was after. Thank goodness we came on Wednesday because I couldn't imagine spending $14 on what I got.  The food here is pretty solid. The salsa was good. My quesadilla was warm and fresh. The chips were seasoned well.   Overall, great service and good food. Wouldn't return though due to price.

Servers and mangers will still check on you to make sure you are doing well and if you need anything else.   They have the largest hot sauce bar I have ever seen. Anything you like from sweet to HOT, all with very clever names.   I ordered the bean and cheese burrito served wet. Couldn't decide between red or green sauce so I got both. All orders come with chips as well. And as a vegetarian it's nice to find a place that had lard free beans and everything is made fresh to order.

The mix of counter service and table service was strange. I don't understand why a counter service place puts the soda fountain behind the counter.  3. I'm confused about why meals come with chips but nothing to dip them in. No salsa or anything. And the hot sauce bar wasn't cutting it.  4.

The staff is always friendly, and the food never disappoints.  I always go for the Beef Flautas (I can never finish this meal due to how much food they give you).  A flauta is a tortilla wrapped around a meat and cheese and then deep fried.  They give you a choice of flour or wheat tortilla - you get 6 pieces of the flautas that fill up the rim/edge of your plate (3 full flautas cut in half).  It doesn't end there - You get many fixings that you can pick/choose from (onions, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream, queso, guacamole, etc.) All of these fixings are located in the center of you plate.  If that isn't enough, you can make a meal of it and get a drink with sides of beans and rice.  This is definitely a wonderful lunch with plenty of tasty food at a great price.  Tip:  Tijuana Flats has an amazing hot sauce bar.  You can be as daring as you wish to be!",

I accidentally spilled queso coming from my chips and queso on my burrito bowl.  It was unavoidable but it improved the burrito bowl.  Eating here is a great idea - plenty of food and a simple tex-mex style.  You need to make sure whatever you are getting has queso on it.  This is the must have flavor ingredient in my opinion.  Without it the burrito bowl would have been a flop.  The flautas are a crowd favorite.  Easy to dip and plenty of comfort.  Everyone working here is nice.  Beyond just hello, but super helpful.  I am convinced they are brainwashed in some sort of service industry cult.  I wish everyone at every restaurant was abducted by this cult.  They aren't creepy helpful, they are just the right amount of helpful.  Excellent management in my opinion if the folks are so cheery.  All you can eat chips and queso, all you can eat chips and queso, and all you can eat chips and queso.  They have a bunch of hot sauces if you are a chili head go nuts.

Thank you flat heads, even you guys in the kitchen. The megaJuana's were a lot bigger in my day though, we used to stuff them up with the cheap ingredients to make them almost overflowing, which were either rice or lettuce.

Worse part was we came home started eating the chips and salsa, I went for my taco and THERE WAS A LONG PIECE OF HAIR IN MY TACO !!! DISGUSTING !!

    "text": "Well one could say that the University area now has more of a lock on the faux-Mex cuisine thanks to Qdoba, Chipotle, and now Tijuana Flats popping up all within walking distance of each other.   Thanks to a yelp event last year, I visited the now-defunct East Blvd location so I had a notion of how the place works and how the food tastes. This location seems a little smaller than the East Blvd location but definitely still has most of the attitude, and I mean that in a good way. TJ's walls are covered in graffiti art, sassy bumper stickers, and staff pictures. It's definitely a good fit for the university area.   I'd been eager to stop by ever since its opening and thanks to a severe taco craving, I made a visit. I was immediately greeted and walked up to the to-go order side. The woman taking my order informed me of the day's special- it was Tijuana Tuesdaze (which I already knew and means two tacos, chips and drink for under $6) so I put my order in for two chicken tacos and decided to go for the guac on the side (which is extra, duh!). As I waited for my order to come out, I got to see the famed hot sauce bar. Seriously, if you fancy yourself a hot sauce fan, TRY ALL THE SAUCES. There's plenty of seating inside to not make you feel like you're sitting on top of anybody else and there's also a small patio area out front.   The staff seemed really upbeat and willing to break down the explanations for any menu items. I witnessed this first hand as two people were completely confused by their chimichangas and the 'make it wet' (TWSS!) option. As for beverages, they offer the standard soda/tea options as well as margaritas, sangria, and beer.   My order came out and the guy who brought it to me made sure he read it back and confirmed my order. I opened up my container and was pleasantly surprised by how neat and delicious everything looked. Be not concerned, for the taco special they do not skimp on the taco size! Everything tasted just as good as I remembered and I will be frequenting Tijuana's on Tuesdays and any other time the taco craving hits!",

They did change the menu recently, and the black bean and chicken flautas are no longer there, which sucks but I just get a combo with black beans and the problem is slightly solved. Customer service is always great, and I am always asked if I need refills or if there is anything else I need. They have discounts for college students and faculty, I'm not sure if that would ever include regular K-12 teachers like me, but the prices are low anyway so it's not a big deal.   The only thing I don't really understand is the tipping protocol, I usually tip a couple of dollars but I don't know if they are being paid based on tips or if they are paid hourly. Also if it is your first time there, yes, they clear the tables for you, you can just leave your plates on the table.",

The rice and beans side was actually really good but the 3 bite portion was a HUGE disappointment. This will definitely not be a place I visit again, ever.",

You can tell by the median review score that the food is going to be good. Somewhere between a ho-hum family diner and the straight up counter culture atmosphere of places like The Common Market, Tijuana Flats falls comfortably in the middle.  Kind of a punk-rock vibe with harsh-neon colors everywhere. This one also has some UNCC Forty-Niner's flair to it as well which is greatly appreciated. The place is always clean and one thing I've noticed, no trash can to be found, the staff takes care of all that. They've found a comfortable hybrid between \"Order at the counter/seat yourself\" and \"Check in with the hostess/full service\" that works really well. You still order at the counter, but the peeps will be out and about making sure everything is to your liking, refilling drinks, and picking up trays for you.  Last night's visit I got the Flautas, and before we start, these AREN'T Taquitos. Flautas are the fluffy 'cousin' of taquitos, made with a burrito sized tortilla and are rolled with the whole tortilla while taquitos are rolled with a folded fortilla. Debate over, this is easily my new favorite at Tijuana. You get a nice crisp shell with all your fillings tucked tightly inside. Be sure to check out the hot sauce bar, even the whimpiest hot sauce patron should give some of the medium options a try (maybe stay away from the one's labeled like they're a death wish).  And of course, I got to mention that these guys give back often by supporting charities with fundraiser nights. Good on you guys, the fundraiser we had last night saw 20% revenue go towards SHRED for Gabe and Luke, a local CLT charity helping Families with extraordinary medical needs.  Can't wait to come back! While it looks like the Concord Mills location has lost most of it's customer service 'steam', this place is always ready and willing to please!",

I ordered the Blackened Chicken Nachos. The amount of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes on top was FOOLISH. There was half a head of lettuce on my nachos. They were cold and I barely had the equivalent of a tablespoon of guacamole. There was probably a half a cup of chicken on the nachos. A very poor food experience to say the least. Definitely wont be going back.",

    "text": "Lets just start by saying who doesn't like tacos?! But this place is beyond just a taco joint! they have the coolest local art work and the ambiance is fantastic! So you walk in and they hand you a menu and you order at front counter. Now let me give you a bit of advise on ordering all tacos come with what they call jolts that is aka for jalapenos, onions ,lettuce, tomato and sour cream this is the way I get them because I love all that but obvi you can get it plain. So first thing your gonna pick your taco hard or soft then your meat I suggest I chicken and one meat and then add the cheese or whatever u want on it. They also have a Megajuana burrito if you are really hungry basically that's just double meat, rice and beans its ridiculous prob could just share that one with a friend. They have quesadillas and taco salads as well all the usual suspects but I'm telling you go with the hard shell dos tacos! They have a great selection of Mexican beers and Sangria which was pretty good. Now here's the BEST part they have a HOT SAUCE BAR! ranging from sweet, mild, medium and to my tongues gonna fall off hot sauce. I try them all because I love a hot sauce bar. o and u must try the queso as well- forgot to mention that earlier its da bomb! Now for dessert they have the churros but Im tellin you get the quesadilla's wrapped in cookie dough and dipped in chocolate! you will thank me!!",

    "text": "So I was in the mood for tacos but I had no clue where I wanted to get them from. Originally I had settled on another place but because I'm so indecisive I decided not to go there and to keep driving and low and behold I come across Tijuana Flats. Of course I looked at the reviews beforehand to see if it was worth a shot. Most of them were positive so I came right in. First off the decor is great. There's a big pic on the wall of what probably is a mascot for the university. There's even a sauce station that has several different sauces you can try at your own risk. The staff is very accommodating and will explain to you how they operate. I decided on the menu item they had on special which was the fajita quesadilla. They had kids meals so I opted to get the little man chicken nuggets and I got churros for dessert. Mannnnn the food was great! The guacamole was fresh...actually everything was fresh. The churros were nice and warm. It was a great meal and very filling. Cost around $20 which I would say is a night well spent. Definitely will come back again!",

Who knows, maybe it truly takes that long to make flautas?   As far as the food, I have no complaints. My son loves the Philly cheesesteak flautas. I also love their queso. I will continue to come here, I just know to order ahead if I don't want a long wait.",

I got my bowl and she wanted nachos. Very filling for dinner. I got mine Powelite style, where the dairy is reduced or fat free items.
