While our server was a kind, courteous, and funny gentleman our chef was the complete opposite. My husband cannot eat mushrooms due to a medical condition (allergy like) and the chef was extremely agitated that he had to make our veggies separate.  He was not only openly agitated he didn't once smile, make any attempt at conversation, or did any sort of tricks for entertainment.  It was my son's first experience and it was awful.  My entire family felt completely offended that our chef was so unpleasant.  15% Gratuity was automatically added to my bill due to our party of 8 and I felt like it wasn't earned.  If I could have tipped only our server I would have but the experience overall did not deserve 15%!",

Overall the food was very good and I had plenty of left overs to eat the next day . Our cook was really nice and did all of the normal tricks and what not. I did expect a bigger restaurant when I walked in but I guess it's a good amount of space! It seemed like they had maybe 4 or 5 hibachi tables and then other normal dining room tables for non-hibachi patrons. The table behind us seemed to have an issue with their cook but it looked like the manager took care of that quickly. Overall I would come back it's a decent priced hibachi meal with quick service. The parking in front of the restaurant seems a bit tight not sure if there was more in the back but I can only imagine what it's like on a fri sat night!",

I would really love to see a kabutos out here! I think I might just take a flight to north Carolina to have some kabutos.  Great owners and staff. Try the shrimp sauce on your rice. The best!!",

Nothing in life is a delicious as ginger sauce, so that helps as well, and they're always accommodating for vegetarians.   I think Kabuto is a great option for a first date. You can talk to each other some, but if it's getting a little lame or if there's not chemistry, you can focus all your attention on the performance. It's also a lot of fun when my niece is visiting with the family, as she enjoys the fire and the food-tossing and all. The menu has enough variety to satisfy picky kid's appetites, and the show keeps them from getting too fussy, even as the evil bedtime witching hour approaches.",

    "text": "So in my search to create a Japanese Steakhouse list, we stopped into Kabuto last night in the University Area. Sushi bar up front and the cook-tops in the back. It was a slow night, so I was curious to see the quality of the staff. Typical menu of soup, salad, rice, veggies, noodles and choice of meat around $18 for single, and $21 for combo.   When we arrived, the soup came out just as we sat down, then the waitress took our drink order. A little odd and rushed, but I moved on and enjoyed the soup. Next was the salad which came with a choice of ginger dressing or ranch. Unfortunately, it seemed like the salad w/dressing was sitting around for pre-made with dressing on top. Ginger dressing was chunky and watery...had one bite and set it to the side.   Next came the rice and veggies. To my surprise, the chef cooked everything at once and it wasn't done with the same excitement and precision as other steakhouses I've been to. After the rice, veggies and meat came the noodles...all piled on the same plate. I prefer the rice to be in a separate bowl, but well.   Overall...just OK. The chef was OK and the food was OK...gots of leftovers as always. They also get you in and out in less than an hour...some might feel rushed, but it felt OK to me as I wasn't able to eat that much because I didn't have a break in between the cooking of other items...it was all piled on.",

    "text": "Since I live nearby and was craving sushi, I decided to give this place a shot. I ended up ordering for take out, but the first impression I got from the hostesses were that they were not friendly. They seemed rather unpleased, whether it might have been how I was dressed, or they just didn't want to be there. Regardless, I didn't seem to be welcomed.  After looking through the menu and realizing they don't have much to offer. I placed my order for a tuna, a spicy tuna roll, and a miso soup; (expecting the tuna roll to have the seaweed on the outside like how it's supposed to be, and the spicy tuna being a mixture of ground tuna and spicy sauce with the rice on the outside, and the miso soup with tofu and seaweed).  I was wrong to set my standards to the norm, and believe me when I say this.  Firstly; the tuna did not look like how it's supposed to be (a reddish color), which leaves me to believe that the fish may be of a lower quality or it's not fresh.   Secondly; All of the rolls had the rice on the outside and the tuna on the inside, with six rolls covered in spicy mayo sauce (and this is what you call spicy tuna?), placed unappetizingly in a styrofoam container.  Thirdly; The miso soup came in a styrofoam beverage cup, filled to 1/2 of the way with no tofu. Just seaweed and a salty soup base.   Overall: Don't go and waste your time/money for sushi. Definitely not worth it.",

    "text": "On my never ending quest to find the best Japanese steakhouse in Charlotte, hubs and I ventured into Kabuto on a random weekday evening.   At first blush, this particular Kabuto isn't necessarily impressive from the outside or inside. When you walk in there is a room with a decent sized bar and a smattering of tables for the sushi eaters or hibachi haters - you choose. Since I was in the mood for a show, we choose to have the whole \"experience\" of hibachi and we led in the back room with eight or so double hibachi tables.   The menu is standard Japanese hibachi, running $15-$23 for your choice of protein(s). The accompaniments support the shoveling of food: clear/green onion soup, ginger salad, shrimp appetizer (2 shrimp) fried rice, vegetables, noodles and your choice of proteins. So...where did Kabuto falter a bit? The service was pretty solid, the hibachi show was mildly entertainment, but the food...was uninspired. Don't get me wrong, it was fine. But when I see a talented hibachi chef using big pads of butter to cook all of my food, it turns me off. Thus the food tasted like bland butter, not the crispy, tasty, fresh hibachi I love (where they typically use oil).   My other minor beef is that the food came out all at once - there was little to no pacing. So, everything butter laden was dumped on my plate. Meh. I'm giving this Kabuto three stars because our server was super attentive and the food was fine, but not great. However, I don't think I'll be back considering I enjoyed the whole experience at the other Japanese steakhouse just down the road.",

My daughter who was allergic to shrimp literally cried because the chef wasnt even skilled enough to cook it carefully on grill in front. So they made it in back and it literally took the whole meal for her to get it. She is 5 years old and loves hibachi. She cried simple as that. Now the food only thing was good was the scallops only because of the product not the cooking. My steak was over cooked i wanted rare to med rare came out med well nearly well. The chef joked like I was being sarcastic but it was bull literally bull caca. He wasnt funny, no volcanoe until i asked. No egg trick No sesame seeds again until i asked. He went to other chefs cart to get ingredients. This place blows and you will blow your hard earned cash. I am a chef myself. I have also worked in a kabuto but it was not this poorly ran or any degree near this. Not all kabutos suck but this was horrible. Get better chefs. The other 3-5 star reviews I am baffled that Charlotte thinks that it is quality hibachi? Read my reviews I have eatten hibachi all over. I speak the truth hopefullu yelp posts this for recommended because its not a lie one bit.",

Every Wednesday & Thursday they offer half off all the sushi/rolls- an awesome steal, it was the only thing ever getting me through my night class! Everything is always fresh-double points for fresh sushi.  I'll explain my 5 star rating in a quick second! I live right down the road from this place and It is weekly staple for my friends and I- even though I always forget to 'check in'.I think I just don't want my yelp friends to see how much I eat here! Since Yelp prides itself on local business- the two owners alone deserve 5 stars. Every night you will find both owners socializing with guests, filling drinks and even making rolls behind the bar- talk about hands on!  I can only review on the sushi portion since I haven't made it past the sushi bar in years.  If you're an adventurous sushi eater you must order off the specialty roll menu go for the Jackpot,Carolina , Harris or Arizona rolls- they won't disappoint! If you're looking for  something simple, spicy tuna always hits the spot.  If you're going to eat on a Wednesday or Thursday service my be a little slow- any other night, the sushi bar has always been speedy.  You can't pass up a sushi meal for 10-15 bucks!  Always a satisfying, fun and easy night out. Nothing too fancy!  See you next week...",

The place is kind of dingy and run down looking around the restaurant on the inside, but hey we weren't here to look at pictures on the wall but see what one of our amazing (hopefully fingers crossed) cook can do in front of us.  So we are seated and there is another table adjacent to ours who was seated probably 5-10 minutes before we were.  With that being said, we received service from another cook and not theirs.  If we had the cook the table next to us had, I would have given this place four stars.  He had a lot of energy and was very personable with everyone at his table, something our server lacked.  He was just going through the motions, not much personality to go with him.  The volcano was the most exciting part of his \"exhibition.\"  The food was decent enough.  I got the shrimp and it tasted good, just not enough shrimp as part of the dish.  This is not a place I would regularly go to, since it is a place reserved for more special occassions or dinner dates.  So, overall not the best or the worst experience, but my takeaway from it all is whoever your cook is can make or break your experience here.",

The chef was amusing and had our food cooked to order quickly, and still put on a show. (I had ordered the filet and shrimp)  My only complaint, and this wasn't something the restaurant could have helped, was the party that was sat at the table with us.",

    "text": "Wednesday nights and Thursday nights. 50% sushi discount. Need I say more?  Going in there the vibe was busy, because people know where to go to eat sushi. Some of the tables in the sushi area is a bit small, but overall, when people leave and clear out the seats open up. I had 2 other people with me when we went. The selection of special sushi of course isn't written up, so the trick here is to ask the waiter what off menu specials there are.  There are special rolls on the back on a white board, but that could be a little bigger to attract the customer's eyes and so it can be ordered more often instead of looking at the paper where customers usually order sushi. The dragon roll my friend ordered, she enjoyed it.  Overall though, I have definitely come here more than once because of the 50% discount and I have eaten my fair share of sushi here. I recommend to try out the hibachi grill as well they have in the back.",

We sat at the bar while we waited for a table. We ended up waiting over an hour just to be seated. When we were seated, it took the server 10 minutes to finally get our drink orders and another 10-15 to bring it to our table. Mind you, it's around 9:45 Wednesday evening at this time. The chef didn't come out until 10:00ish, after the restaurant has closed. He tried his best, but it was evident he was done for the night. No one ever brought our cake out- our server simply said no one informed her it was a birthday celebration, but the chef somehow knew? As soon as he finished cleaning the grill, the server brought us all to-go boxes, as if she wanted to rush us out the door. We were so disappointed and tired, we just put the food away and left.   To make our night even worse, by the time we got home at 11, every one of us had an upset stomach from the bit of food we did eat.  Wasted 3 hours and $200. Next time, we'll stick Fuji or even US Sushi.",

    "text": "Kabutos is good for what it is:  a Benihana-type restaurant.  A group of about 8 people sit around a giant grill and are entertained by the chef as he cooks the meals right in front of them, wielding sharp knives and doing tricks with each food item he prepares.  Kids especially love it and it's also good fun for a group of friends going out on the town.  The Hibachi dinners generally come with a salad with ginger dressing (YUM!), rice and veggies, an option of a choice of meat, and dipping sauces.  The flavor of the meal is very good despite the relatively few ingredients put into each (and I normally love a lot of spices).   And I do enjoy the entertainment of watching my meal prepared in front of me.  As for the sushi, I have yet to try it since I usually reserve eating sushi for when I visit sushi houses.  When I go to a Japanese steakhouse, I typically want the Hibachi show and food.   I haven't been to other Kabuto locations, but this particular Kabuto could use some refreshment.  It's a little dark and dingy inside with no particular decor or splashes of color.  Hence, part of my reasoning for only a 3-star rating.  Why else?  Kabutos isn't someplace I'd go out of my way for, but if someone's going I might tag along.  I've dined at Benihana's in L.A. and at Mitsukoshi at Epcot so, to me, Kabutos pales in comparison.  But hey--it's cheaper than a plane ticket!",

The chef wasn't a Hibachi entertainment pro, but he got the food tasting good and that is the most important thing.  Service -- 1 star Service was mediocre. For my party, the waiting staff consistly gaffed on our orders. One colleague wanted steamed rice but didnt get it. Another colleague received a beer with a cracked bottle lip, and almost cut herself. I ordered an appetizer and never got. While the staff was apologetic about the missing appetizer, the bottle incident was handled very poorly and left a very negative feeling from my coworker.  ***HOWEVER, the night I went there was a frat pledge party so with 100+ hormonal college kids wrecking havoc, I would give the staff a pass on that. They were managed decently well, but we were left out in terms of quality service.   Atmosphere -- 2 stars Meh.",

The food- fried rice and the steak was good. He cooked it to a nice medium rare, suggested a mustard sauce that was incredible paired up with it",

The sushi was awesome and fresh, and all sushi is included in the 50% deal, no limited menus or restrictions. I've been trying to find decent, budget friendly sushi since I moved to Charlotte, and this is by far one of my top choices. They don't have too many specialty rolls, so if you're looking for extravagant sushi you won't find it here, but still a solid sushi menu and just enough specialty rolls to make it worth it. I sat in the sushi bar area which is small but I believe they have more seating in the back at hibachi stations. Over all go on a Wednesday or Thursday for a good deal!",

    "text": "We did the birthday dinner thing there with a group of people last weekend and it was a shoddy time to say the least. It took them forever to seat us which I don't particularly hold against them because I understand they like to wait for the entire party to arrive so they can flip tables better but it' always seems to drag forever. Once we got seated they took our orders and started rolling out the soups and salads. The best part was when I ordered Tempura with shrimp and the waiter asked me if that was sushi. Good stuff, Our chef guy was pretty spot on with the usual flamboyant spatula flipping and knife slicing and I'd probably say his show was the best part of the evening. The food itself was everything you would expect from hibachi style grill and the portions were generous.   After the meal they came out and sang the bday song and served up the cake just like usual so that part of the evening rolled fairly well. It just feels like the employees are going through the motions and sometimes its painful to watch them sing. Next time I'll request no less than three takes on the bday song each time telling them \"needs more cowbell\".   Time to pay the bill and get out right?....Sure, if you want to wait forever and a day. Oh yeah, and when my bill came it had my Tempura listed but that was a little bit of a thumb in the eye since the tempura never arrived to begin with. I had the guy remove it from the check which added even more time to the already lengthy process of getting the hell out.   The last \"best part\"of the evening is when the bartender from the bar area approached my buddy to pay his tab from when we were waiting for our table when we first arrived. My friend had already paid in cash though. Whoever the bartender guy was he totally missed the 20$ my friend laid on the bar for some beers and accosted him in front of everyone to pay up. The bartender eventually backed off which was a nice little concession but the insult was already there lingering in the air.   I'd give this place another try if the discounted sushi is as good as some of the reviews say. But standing on service, cost and cleanliness I'd recommend that you just shop around for a different place.",

Also the gratuity that was added in was 17 dollars which is a meal so I was highly upset about that because I didn't receive 17 dollar food and service. I would come back because the biggest issue I had was the food seasoning or lack there of and that can easily be corrected with my suggestion of adding more while they are cooking it.",

I must have been there on a bad day because the service was slow, the food was bland, and the price/portion was sad.   I ordered the vegetable hibachi with salad, no soup because it's made from shrimp-based broth and I'm vegetarian. I waited almost 25 mins before my food was ready for take out. The hostess handed me a bill ,which was about $11 and some change and I inquired if she had charged me for the soup as well even though I did not buy any. (They couldn't even replace the soup for one that was vegetable-based). She said that  they still have to charge you for it. Alright, that's fine. I look inside the takeout box to make sure my order is correct, and inside is the most pathetic portion I've ever seen: full of rice and a tiny portion of chopped up vegetables. The salad wasn't a real salad either: chunks of browned iceberg lettuce with a few shreds of carrot.   I was pretty upset about this so I told the hostess that the portion was a pretty bad size for $11 and they didn't even have enough vegetables in it. She gave me this \"ummmm\" look and stepped into the office with the cash register. I waited about a minute or two and she never came out; I left.  So the service was slow, portion was terrible for the price, and no one came out to address my issue.  Oh well, just my luck- but it gets worse: I get home and start eating my meal anyway, but it's so bland that I have to add my own soy sauce. The ginger dressing for the \"salad\" was fine and the best part was the chili sauce-  it was actually spicy and not oily. Good job Kabuto.  I might return to try their sushi, but I definitely won't be getting anything else here again, and I wouldn't recommend getting takeout from here as well.",

After eating here dozens of times in the last 2 years, we were told tonight that we can no longer order fried rice without vegetables mixed in it even though I have an allergy. When the manager was asked if an accommodation could be made we were told no, we could have the rice with vegetables or we could leave. He was incredibly rude. If you have an allergy or intolerance stay away because apparently they are doing well enough in their business that they can afford to turn customers away.",

I ordered two of their specialty rolls: dragon roll and Carolina Sunrise. Decent for the price but the dragon roll tasted a bit bland. The crab salad on top of the Carolina Sunrise had a bit of wasabi kick to it. I was expecting more of a volcano roll crab salad on top but this was a nice surprise.   My cousin got the lucky 7 and jack pot rolls. Lucky 7 really hit the spot! Most of their specialty rolls consisted of shrimp tempura.",

Actually, after he was done cooking, he told me that he had accidentally shorted me on shrimp and that they were cooking more in the back to bring out to me.  I was really impressed with his honesty, because I never would have noticed that he hadn't given me enough. The service was great, too.  My drink never got low.  My only complaint is that it's pretty expensive.  The next time my husband craves hibachi though, we'll be back.",

Our waiter was great and joked around and didn't just do his part and leave.   We had the chicken and steak hibachi and everyone's food was cooked deliciously.  The child only wanted noodles but the chef was so kind and even gave her some chicken and rice.     The rice, noodles, veggies, and meat were cooked to perfection and the other people that were sat with us were fun to be around also! The portions were amazing! So much food that I took about half of mine home!  I would recommend the hibachi to anyone who is hungry and loves to have their food cooked directly in front of them!",

The half price day maybe had something to do with the bad quality but this sushi quality would get an F from me.",

    "text": "This locally owned family restaurant has been a favorite amongst University Area residents for years now.  Located just across from the University, in the back of the Harris Teeter, Kabuto's is probably the best Japanese style Hibachi and Sushi spot in the University City Bubble.  I LOVE their sushi.  Their fresh-water eel is unmatched.  I also love their California roll (sometimes I add salmon to it).  The sushi is always made fresh to order.  The rice is always soft and the wasabi is strong just the way I like it.  Although I am partial to the sushi bar located in the front of the restaurant, I have on the rare occasion, sat in the back, and partaken of the hibachi experience their fun and entertaining chiefs put on.  The experience is always entertaining and the food is always above-par.   There's nothing not to like about this place.  The service is ALWAYS exceptional.  I have been here well over 50 times in my time in Charlotte and have never had poor service here.  There is always plenty of parking located directly in front of the restaurant.    Kabuto's is one of those rare establishments in the University Area that are worth driving to if you don't live in the University City Bubble.  Though I don't live in the UCB anymore, Kabuto's is one of the few places that I still return to dine at on a regular basis.   EAT AT KABUTO'S!",

The soup and salad came out in a timely manner and the overall flavor and taste of the food was decent, nothing to crave over though.  I was slightly disappointed in the noodles, that's all they were, just some heated up noodles on the grill, no flavor, not taste, no nothing, just noodles.    My reasoning for only two stars is that our cook was not very personable.   He did no tricks with his utensils, no volcano, no train, he didn't really interact with the group at all.  He cooked the food and that was about it.  When going to these hibachi grills, part of the reason for going is the entertainment and to have fun while the cook makes all your food.   I'll look to a different hibachi grill next time.",

I mentioned to manager that when you spending your money you should be able to order the food the way you want it.   He told me to cook at home if I want food the way I want.

He was friendly and attentive and it's always a plus when they acknowledge the little ones. Even though they don't have to, greeting the children helps them to feel welcomed as well. Out of all of our visits here, this was the first time that our food was too salty. I was surprised because it's typically spot on in terms of seasoning. I will note that the chef was having a difficult time seeing whether or not any salt was coming out of the shaker...  The food is reasonably priced and much cheaper than the dinner menu. I will say that the restaurant could use some upgrades. The carpet is sticky and reminds me of the skating rink for some odd reason. I would recommend this restaurant for lunch, but can't say the higher dinner  prices are worth the money.",

This is a LIE and is completely ridiculous (As are most excuses for prejudice and discrimination). The owner then tried to say customers don't want to see someone's underwear while eating. Since he tried to act like this was about modesty for the good of customers, we asked what his policy was on women wear extremely low cut shirts. He joked he would give them a discount.

    "text": "After a 26+ year love affair with this restaurant it is time to say goodbye.  We went in on a Saturday night to celebrate a difficult chapter in our life coming to an end.  We walk in, gave our name, received a 40 minute wait time and told to sit anywhere we like for the wait  It was packed, a party was gathering in the waiting area and bar (30 plus people).  The rest of the family goes back to the car as I sit on the bench in the waiting area right beside the office door.  I can see the hostess stand.  The hostess ladies (3 of them) walk by me multiple times going in and out of the office.  After 50 minutes my husband walks back in to sit with me and stops by the hostess stand to see how much longer it might be.  Her response \"we called your name four times and moved your name to the bottom of the list\".  This simply did not happen.  They never once called our name.  Never once looked my way to see if any name they did call was me, etc.  As we had plans afterwards we could not wait another 40 minutes.  As I walked out I told the ladies that they never called my name and I was sitting there the entire time watching and listening. They immediately had an attitude, one girl puffing her chest out and rolling her head around being rude and extremely unprofessional.  Over 26 years folks.  I've stuck with them through the highs and lows, but this was the final straw.  I've never once complained about this establishment.  I've chatted with the owner many times and while I don't know him by name he would have recognized us immediately.  I asked for him and was told he was not there.  They are also screening his calls or keeping them from him.  Either way, her aggressive body language and horrible attitude was it for me. When you make a mistake, own it.   Thanks for the memories.",

We did not know that there was a minimum person count before they use the teppanyaki grill. Since there were only two of us, the waitress informed us they would not be able to accommodate. Of course that broke my daughter's heart as this was one of the reasons she loved this place (and the food of course). She started tearing up. I felt horrible because her weekend party was cancelled due to none of her friends were able to make it (summer birthdays are the worst) The staff at Kabuto decided to do the performance with the teppanyaki grill. This was the best gift they could have given my daughter. I will be a regular customer and definitely will recommend. Btw the food was delicious.",

It is clear that there is some inconsistency and lack of communication. The issue isn't about paying its about the staff not being on one accord with policies.",

When you walk in the girl at the podium just stands there like a vegetable with a disgusted look on her face like she doesn't want to do her job.   2. The rest of the wait staff EXCEPT a girl and a guy (I can't recall their names) are horrible because they always have nasty attitudes. They need to be fired and the manager needs to hire people that are energetic, happy, and actually want to work there.   3. I have never gotten hibachi however when you're getting sushi and sit down sometimes they take forever to bring you menus and take your drink order.   TIP: ALWAYS HAVE PABLO MAKE YOUR SUSHI, NEVER THE OTHER GUY! He never cleans his station and when he made my sushi once it was absolutely disgusting. I don't know how he is still working there, Pablo always uses fresh ingredients and makes everything perfectly.  4. They NEVER give you enough shrimp sauce.  Other than those things, the sushi that Pablo makes is wonderful and is the only reason I come back to this restaurant.",

The two young men went to their cars to change but the racist and stubborn owner refused them service fully based on their color and the fact that he said \"they smelled like weed.\" I was there went it happened as I ordered a to go meal but little did I know it was run by such poor management who judged people based off of their skin color and assumptions about how they smelled. It's 2019 and I know racism isn't dead but it hurt me to see two young men be turned away when they chose to frequent this establishment. When I confronted the manager I stated that what he did was wrong and that I won't be frequenting this establishment again , he said good bye. I think he should really reevaluate his judgment because it's hurting the people of this community. I just feel bad for the two young men that had to face someone's small mindedness knowing that they are not accepted by society due to the color of their skin and what they choose to do with their life.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that this restaurant was the worst place ive ever been to in my entire life ( no BS) First of all, We had a huge party so  we made reservations for 8:30pm. Unfortunately, we had to wait until all of our guest to get there, so we didn't get seated until 9:30pm. We had three full tables in the hibachi area and neither of us were served until almost 10pm.. the first table that was served got their soups, drinks , salads, and sushi a whole 15-20 mins before the other two tables did.  HOLD UP THOUGH! thats not even the WORST part!  when we finally got our chef, he rushed our dinner because they were \"ready to close\", which caused my chicken, a couple of others, and another girls shrimp to be undercooked! He also made very sexist and racist jokes towards black women about their hair, it was disgusting!   I tried to tell the waitress about the undercooked chicken, but she had an attitude the entire time she served us. (My drink was never filled unless I asked and my friend ordered sushi and an alcoholic beverage way before we got our chef and didn't receive any of it until after our chef was done \"cooking\" the hibachi.) so I asked her for her manager and he also came with the rudest demeanor. He gave me a 10% discount but I would've still had to pay $20 for the meal. I was not doing that!! so it took me to have to threaten to call his corporate and an inspector for me to get the entire meal half price...... I only paid $10 and it didn't even deserve that much! (the rice and veggies were dope tho)  overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone! Bad service and terrible cooks!!",

I was not disappointed, at the chef picked my dishes for me based on a few questions. His selections were sp good that I asked for another roll to go.

I asked the manager if I could have friend rice with no eggs and not only did he refuse to do it he was beyond rude. So rude I decided to leave because I did not want to give my money to an establishment that told me \"sometimes it isn't about making the customer happy, it's about efficiency.\" I am not sure why it is 'Against' policy to place some rice aside from the rice cooked with egg but apparently it is. I could not believe the way I was treated. I left feeling so enraged, sad, and felt like I was not being accommodated.... pitiful.... worst experience and defiantly NOT somewhere I would recommend.... like ever ha!.",

The sushi rice is the consistency of regular rice not real sushi rice. The food is bland, which is a lot coming from someone who likes food that's non offensive. The staff is rude and based of the experiences of others it is evident that the manager targets a specific demographic in the worst way.",

And presentation was awful as well, but the service was ok. It was horrible that we had to wait until the ENTIRE party arrived, and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. Like it made no sense! I won't be going back unless it's a birthday party for someone and if it is I'll order water.   Not Pleased",

The sushi chef was great and he asked for our likes and dislikes. He altered our rolls to our liking and they were very good. He handed us, in two seperate occasions, complimentary rolls that he felt we would like. They were both very good. We would like to give this place a solid 3 - 3.5 stars but as we checked out we found that we were charged for one of the complimenary rolls by the owner. Maybe it was a misunderstanding. Maybe we should have said something. We may go again because we really enjoyed the sushi chef and the rolls. The chef said he would \"hook us up\" next time but we're worried of the spying owner that may charge us again for a complimentary roll, but it wont happen twice without a fight from us. We'll see....",

We are still new to the area and last week when we ate at Kabuto's, we noticed that our car was running out of gas. The owner gave us directions and told us to call the restaurant if we ran out of gas before we got to the gas station and that he would help us. That is wonderful customer service.",

The amount of food the chef prepares for you is enough for 2 meals! I love that I always bring home a leftover box. I'm not a vegetable fan, but the chicken and steak is always cooked how I like it. My drink is always kept filled and the managers are always walking around the restaurant making sure everyone is kept happy. Marten and his brother really make you feel welcomed and they definitely remember returning customers, which I love!! Thanks guys!",
