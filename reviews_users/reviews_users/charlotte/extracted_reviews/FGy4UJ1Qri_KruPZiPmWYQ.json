I got a churro and it was so sugary when I bit it the sugar went all over me (even after I tried to pat it off). I decided to try it tonight because I was too hungry. My friends order came out wrong, 2 of the workers did not understand what we were saying to help us correct it. When we got the food again, it was still wrong. I am very disappointed. The Waverly location is much better.",

I seems a bit more spacious than the location in Elizabeth and better suited for groups. Comparing the two, the only difference I noticed was in the green beans, which have more of a fire grilled taste of the Ballantyne location. There is parking in the front and back if it's crowded. Viva chicken is on my list of the best thing since sliced bread.",

Only giving 4 star cause my Husband got the Wow sandwich and the ciabatta roll was a bit dry. Other than that it was all great :) oh, and if your thirsty, grab the herbal lemonade too. So very tasty and refreshing.",

    "text": "GOOD LORD. So good. So so good. I was actually reluctant to go here since I wasn't in the mood to start with another cuisine, but my friend convinced me it was *that* good, so I obliged. It wasn't terribly busy when we got there around 12:45 on a Monday. I had already decided to get The Great or The Inca with steak pending what the cashier's recommendation was. Before that could even happen, my friend said we could split the two, which was good with me.  I ended up with half of The Great on ciabatta and half of The Inca on ciabatta with yucca fries. We decided to eat outside. My friend's The Great came out way faster than my The Inca, but once they both came, we dug in. Something about both of the sandwiches was just really satisfying. Maybe it was the excellent meat (chicken was probably a bit better than the steak), maybe it was the great bread, who knows. It was just really freaking good. Then I discovered the sauce. Some of the best sauces I have ever tasted. Both the yellow and green sauces were out of this world. They went great with both of my sandwiches and the yucca fries.   The service, as others have said, is phenomenal. Whether it's holding the door for you as you go outside or checking on you as you eat, they know service. Way to go.   I found myself craving Viva right after I left which I take as a great sign. I think I'll head back for lunch today. Just fantastic all around.",

Everyone seems to think so too because it was PACKED.   Think... Chipotle-ish, but like a million times better obviously.   Order your food at the counter, take a number and sit down and your food is brought to you - FAST.   The service is kind of ridiculously amazing for a sort of fast food joint - they walk around and check on you, get you refills, have smiles on their faces, work fast, and are all around just pleasant.   We ate dessert before lunch because... I just wanted to do that...now let's talk about the TRES LECHES cake that will change your life. Just take a bite into heaven and soak it all in. I can't even describe it - it is just that delicious. Forget whatever diet you're on and ORDER THIS.   Get the dark meat chicken - so moist... so flavorful... and drench it in the yellow sauce they give you. You will not be disappointed. The green one had too strong of a cilantro flavor for me.   Other winners were the green beans and sweet potato fries and don't neglect the HERBAL LEMONADE (mint, basil, and rosemary deliciousness) Sounds weird... tastes amazing.   I just cannot say enough good things about this place. I want it every day.",

Last time I got the bowl I asked them for more beans and less rice.  Depending on who is working I will get all rice stacked up and like 2 pieces of chicken.  No bueno.  I need more beans, less rice and a buttload of chicken.  I don't need all the onions that come on top either.    Anyway, overall scrumptious joint.

I explained to Jefferson (the manager) that my food was recently delivered *AND* this was my 1st time EVER eating at Viva Chicken. A little hesitant and cautious, Jefferson was listening for me to drop a bomb. I explained to him that I knew that anytime a customer calls and ask to speak directly to a manager, 99% of the time, it's something negative. This was one of the BEST chicken wraps that I've ever eaten. And it's healthy. (quick note: I am a very picky eater, especially with chicken).

My husband and I like to share the whole chicken with sides when we go and have leftovers to take home.  Our favorite sides are:  fries (my favorite, there's something addicting and SO good about them) and plantains (my husband loves them so much he won't try any other sides!).  My niece ordered the kids chicken fingers today and she loved those too (ask for a kids menu, it's not on the main menu).    What is remarkable about Viva Chicken is that no matter what time of day I go in (2pm late lunch today), the food is always fresh, hot and delicious.  The service, which I don't normally expect at a \"Fast service\" restaurant is superb.  Such wonderful and friendly people!  It makes me happy to go there.

The plantains were some of the best we've ever had, and all the sauces are delicious. Love that you can try (taste) their specialty beverages. Next time I'm getting one!",

    "text": "We visited Viva Chicken on Saturday 1/3/15.   Finding this restaurant was a great find.  The food and service were great.  Food: Great  We both ordered the 1/4 chicken with two sides. This gave us the chance to try four different sides: Canary Beans, Yucca Fries, Cilantro Infused Rice and Sweet Plantains.    The chicken had a great flavor and was very moist. It came with two sauces a mild and a medium sauce.  The mild sauce (yellow color) was my favorite.  Although it wasn't hot, it had a lot of great flavors.  The medium sauce (green color) was good, but didn't have as much flavor as the mild sauce.  The sides were good.  The Cilantro Infused Rice was our favorite side as it had just the right flavors.  I can't wait to try several more of the 11 different sides that they have available. I mentioned visiting Viva Chicken to a co-worker.  Her family is from Peru, she se mentioned that this is their favorite Peruvian restaurant.  It offers the most authentic Peruvian food that her parents have tasted since moving here.  Portion Size = Perfect The portion size of the meals was also great. I was full and still had a little food left on the plate. Service = 5 star restaurant. At first glance the restaurant seems to be a high scale fast food restaurant.  A place where you fill up your own  soft drinks and get your own napkins and utensils from a condiments table.  But the service I received was better than I've received in many upscale restaurants.  It was almost as if the waiters were reading our minds.  As we filled our cups, the waiter offered to give us straws and lids.  Once we got to the table and our food arrived, the waiter saw I had forgotten get a spoon for my soup.  So he brought a spoon over to me. When he noticed that my wife and I were tasting each other's sides, he brought over a spoon for her also.  He also offered to refill my drink.  We also had a manager stop by to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes rotisserie chicken, Peruvian food or just looking for a great new place to eat.",

This local chain(?), also with a single location in Utah., offers a quick, cheap, and filling meal that doesn't skimp on the quality.   Notes/highlights:   +The Ballantyne location is tucked into the Shops at Toringdon. Though the outside design does make it stand out from the other business in the same strip  + Request an allergen menu if you are unfamiliar with their offering. With the exclusion of a few items, there is a relatively high number of GF items as well as CF items.  ***Sadly the plantains are NOT gluten free as they are fried in a shared fryer and the risk of cross contamination is quite high. I was impressed that individual helping me at the counter was aware of this and extremely knowledgeable about their allergen menu and able to communicate the risks without me having to ask or offering this information.  + On nicer days, there is an open patio type space to enjoy your meal, or you can dine indoors, though it is a bit louder.  + Price - cheap for the quantity and quality of food provided  + Service was friendly and extremely helpful  Tips:   - Parking can be a pain, especially during the lunch time rush, so account for extra time if your leaving the office  + They offer online ordering, which will require you to setup an account. I'd recommend it during the lunch rush/",

All of the utensils, plates, bowls and cups are either biodegradable or recyclable. I don't suggest you come to this location for lunch on a weekday unless you have the time to wait. It's difficult to get in here and back to the office in under an hour unless you're close enough to walk from work. They definitely get hit hard and it can be overwhelmingly crowded.

So glad I finally got to today.You order at the counter and take a number and find a spot to sit and they serve you your food. There were about 8 people in front of us and I was surprised at how fast the line was going! Guy at the counter was really helpful and friendly. We gave him our order and he thanked us for coming here for dinner.   We each got the half chicken and two side items. Chicken was juicy and delicious!! Half chicken was so big I could only finish half of it. I got cilantro infused rice and chicken soup. Rice was good and not dry. There was little flavor to it but every now and then I would get a kick of cilantro flavor. There were small pieces of carrots and peas in it. Soup was good. I wish you could get a bigger version of it. There was pulled chicken in it. It had rice and red onions and peppers in it. Very good and flavorful. It would be perfect for a cold day or even if you were sick. I got the \"gringo killer\" sauce. It went so well with the chicken and rice.   My fiance got green beans. The beans had chopped red peppers in it. He also got the quinoa. He was surprised it was served cold and he loved it! It had cilantro, red onions and peppers in it. He wasn't sure what type of sauce was in it but he loved it. He used the green sauce for his chicken which was mint and jalapeno base.   This restaurant was super clean and so was the bathroom. The staff was really friendly. We had someone that worked there walk up to our table and asked how everything was. There was also a guy that worked there that did such an awesome job cleaning the restaurant and give excellent customer service. He was cleaning tables so fast so people can sit down and eat. He was also walking by and offering to take your empty plates. He cleaned the drink and sauce station.   I would definitely come back!!",

I wish they would branch out to CA, if you ever do-DM me! I'll be your manager. Lol! But really- their sauces are to die for. I like the yellow one (mild) and my hubby does the reddish one (hot.) half chicken and two sides is enough for us to split, but their cilantro infused rice is soooo good we get an extra order of it on the side. Trust me, give this place a try.",

It had great reviews and was only five minutes from where I was working.  When I got there it was pretty busy but the line moves right along.  I ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado, with the pulled Peruvian rotisserie chicken and the homemade limeade. They give you a number to place on your table and they bring your order to you.  There's quite a bit of seating in the restaurant.  I didn't wait long for my food at all.    All I can say is that this was the best lunch I have had in a long time.  The quinoa stuffed avocado was amazing, definitely get the pulled chicken with it.  The chicken is seasoned perfectly.  The homemade limeade is lime,basil, mint, and rosemary.  Amazing!   I liked this place so much that I came back the next day and ordered the Andina power food salad, kale romaine mix, organic quinoa, seasonal fruit, edamame, toasted almonds, red peppers, avocado, with a lime passion fruit vinaigrette and of course the rotisserie chicken on top.  The salad was great and it is a good size salad.  I would definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu.  Check this place out you won't regret it.",

    "text": "A friend had recently asked me to help him pick up a new bed arrangement at an apartment here in the same complex. Pretty tempted to say no, but against my better judgment I told him I would. After powering through that cluster, we swung in for a bite.   Another precursor. Been trying to keep up a healthy diet. After eating right throughout the day, hitting the gym for an hour, then helping my buddy out, the last thing I wanted to do was roll to a fast food joint at 8p and undo everything I did that day. So stopping in at Viva was a great choice considering. I ordered \"The Great\" wrap with some green beans as a side. The meal was pretty damn good to say the least. Definitely a healthy option without lack of flavor and satisfaction like similar dishes elsewhere.  So if you haven't figured it out already, this place mainly serves dishes with some form of chicken and \"healthier\" ingredients. From what I've noticed simply by means of food watching, I was generally impressed. Most dishes served here are very well put together and look delish.  Another item which I tried and would like to highlight is their Herbal Lemonade. Let me just rave about this a minute. Absolutely. Fantastic. Recipe. I have never had anything so refreshing. A little on the sweet side for me, but after adding a little water and ice from their fountain I was able to get what I wanted out of it. This is a must try here!  The service for this location was absolutely great- very attentive. Great modern atmosphere and decor. Not crowded- at least for 8p anyway.   Word on the street is they are planning to open a Huntersville location- close to me- can't wait!",

This is no supermarket rotisserie chicken! The sides were awesome the green beans have a soy and ginger sauce they are cooked in. Delicious!

The chicken was a little dry but not so much that it took away from the flavor of the dish. The rice was cooked perfectly and the portion size was huge! I was very hungry, and admittedly can put away a lot of food when I want, and I still left with about 1/3 of it to-go. My only complaint really is that the environment is quite loud. If you're looking for a nice quiet spot for a romantic date night, this is not the place for you. Other than that, we will definitely come back!",

My wife ordered a chicken bowl which according to her was amazing and too much food but she had leftovers for the next day (Bonus!!) She also got the plantain fries which she loved. I ordered the Quarter chicken and two sides now I wasn't a big fan of the sides but I am a picky eater. Now the Chicken was amazing cooked perfectly had a seasoning on it that was absolutely the best thing on a chicken. AMAZING!!

The placement of the drink counter makes it difficult to maneuver, especially during peak hours like weekday lunch. The atmosphere can be quite hectic and stressful if you visit during a peak time, but the food is certainly worth it.",

    "text": "I LOVE viva chicken. I feel like I've eaten at every Charlotte location, but the Ballantyne location is closest to where I work. I always get the adina power food salad, it's hands down one of my favorite meals... from anywhere... EVER. I eat at Viva probably once every other week if not once a week. I really want to give this location 5 stars because I love the food so much, but I have a problem with the employees. Every time I eat here (usually between anywhere from 2pm-4pm) it seems to me they are annoyingly overstaffed. Like all the employees don't have anything to do, so they start trying to find things to do to look busy. I've had someone come lean over my table and clean it while I was halfway through my meal. I've sat at a booth close to the kitchen and had 5-6 workers leaning all over my booth shouting and laughing at each other while I'm trying to eat. It happens almost every time I'm there. Now I just get take out because I can hardly stand to eat in their dining room anymore. Still love the food, just not a huge fan of the dining experience.",

    "text": "It was enjoyable and I'll absolutely return to try out other menu items. Husband and I shared a chicken platter with green beans and cilantro rice. The rice was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point - cilantro is one of my favorites and in my opinion, often under utilized. Greens were great. I was over the moon with the chicken, but certainly appreciate the time and detail invested in their cooking process. The Peruvian seasoning is actually put under the skin before they roast in a charcoal oven. This results in juicy, flavorful pieces and if you're not a fan on skin-on, don't fret... because it peels right off. Viva also makes three specials sauces to accompany their menu, but I don't eat spicy food at all so was unable to sample these. My husband loves it and goes often with his colleagues - he definitely feels the sauce 'makes the chicken a 5.'",

It's the only thing I've had so far because I can't not order them.  The first time I got them I didn't change them at all, but I always add chicken. I think the balsamic is a little overwhelming, so now I order it without. And it's so good! I can't even explain it. Just the right size, filling, but about $10. So it is a little pricey, but delicious.   The people are always very friendly and helpful here. It's a clear your own table kind of place, but someone always offers to take my plate for me and refills my little water cup.",

Food is just as delicious as I remember from the Elizabeth location. Quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken? I think I could eat this everyday.  My only minor complaint is really just to let the owners & staff know (and I'm sure it's because they're new and working out the kinks) when dining in, please don't have your staff check on a table once every 2-3 minutes. I'm not even exaggerating. A few times, one worker was leaving our table after asking how we were doing as another approached to ask the same question. Literally - seconds apart. I know it seems crazy to complain about too much customer service, but that's what we experienced. My dining companion said she'd experienced the same thing earlier in the week.  The service at the original location is great - attentive without being overwhelming. I'm certain the Ballantyne location will get it figured out soon too.",

It's a great looking and modern restaurant specializing in Peruvian rotisserie chicken, also known as Pollo a la Brasa. Any my oh my, is it good!  My hubby and I visited on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and while it was busy, the experience was smooth and the service was super attentive.  We shared an appetizer - the quinoa stuffed avocado - it definitely could've passed for an entree.  It was awesome - fresh and savory.  My husband had the chicken soup and it was amazing.  I had a 1/4 chicken with yucca fries and the chicken was so flavorful - the 24 hour marinate was really apparent and the yucca fries was a welcome change to the ordinary potato. We also shared the Pumpkin cheesecake - a perfect ending to an amazing lunch.    We can't wait to go back.",

I always look forward to going and trying something new because I know it will be tasty. Be sure to try their drinks as well- especially the purple corn juice (sounds weird but tastes great) and the herbal lemonade. The employees are always attentive and helpful as well.

The avocados are always the perfect consistency - never too firm or mushy, and the quinoa is the perfect pillow for the pulled chicken that's drizzled with the yummiest mayo and balsamic sauces. My only critique is that I wish they would put more of the sauces on top! It's so delicious that I often find myself craving it. Case and point: I had leftovers in the fridge at work from my visit earlier in the week and it's all I could do to make it to the appropriate lunch hour, so that I could devour it without being judged.  Service is typically good, though on my last visit my manager received her food and I had to wait for what seemed like a good bit of time before my food came out, despite ordering right behind her. Nonetheless, it was worth the wait. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Ballantyne area looking for a new lunch/dinner option.",

The food has a little kick (spice) to it, but not too much. And i'm someone who doesn't like spicy food. Everything is so flavorful. Together with a coworker, we ordered the Peruvian Chicken, Green Beans, Sweet Potato Fries and House Salad. Being it was during the lunch rush, I ordered online. It said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived a few minutes early and went to the designated pick up line and my food was bagged and ready. The place was really busy. They only serve one dressing, thats balsamic, which my coworker said was the best she's had and it tasted like it was homemade. Hands down those green beans were the best i've had from a restaurant. The Sweet potato fries were decent. Not crunchy. But I assume its because of the sealed take out boxes they were in. I still ate every last one. But the chicken!! Ohhh that chicken!! Soooo flavorful! I dont know how else to describe it. Loved the prices. The 1/4 chicken meal was 8.50 and the 1/2 was 12.50. I literally can't wait to go back. I already know what I will be trying next!!",

The green beans (which I don't eat ever, but tried them to see what they were like) were INCREDIBLE. My mom's \"The Great\" bowl and fries (oh my word, those fries) were awesome too! We also got the chocolate cake and the tres leches cake, which were to DIE for. And the herbal lemonade was surprisingly yummy (but there were no refills on it).  The yellow-y sauce that they give you is PERFECTION. My mom and I dipped everything that we got in that sauce. I took home a container, used it as dressing, and fell even more in love. My stepmom tried it and fell in love too. We've both declared it as our favorite sauce ever. I want to buy a bottle and use it on EVERYTHING.  This place was pretty great, and I only don't give it five stars because I don't think it has enough seating and the people working at the registers weren't the nicest. The food was great though. I'm definitely going again!",

We searched Yelp (of course) before ordering and went with some food suggestions (1 whole chicken, cilantro rice, plantains and a variety of sauces). The hubby went and picked up the order and was treated to samples of fresh juices that he raved about to me. Next time we will definitely go eat in the restaurant.

Viva chicken is not the type of restaurant where you have to wait 30 minutes to get your food served to your table, but more of a quick sit-where-you-want restaurant. Even though it's fast, the food is exceptional! My family likes the whole chicken with yuca, plantains, and sweet potato fries. The chicken is excellently seasoned and has an addicting crispy skin. The yuca is perfectly crispy, the plantains are sweet and delicious, and the sweet potato fries are simply perfect! My family also ADORES the sauces! There's yellow, green, and red sauces, but my personal favorite is the yellow. The drinks are thirst quenching and very good, I favor the Maracuya because it is sweet and fruity.

If you're like me, you like beans that are full of flavor, and the canaries were sauteed with some garlic and other seasoning that just worked well.  The quinoa was flavorful, but cold;  I would've preferred them served warm, but still,  very tasty. You can expect quick service and reasonable prices.  My dish was 8.95 for example.  Also, they offer specialty drinks. My favorite is a corn and cinnamon based drink (the purple one) but the passion fruit is the more popular,  but I don't think you can go wrong with either. Their fried rice with chicken, eggs, and onions is very good.  The seating is ample with and outdoors area.  This place staffs friendly workers and two separate members of  management stopped by and checked in with us. This is a must try if you're in the area for great chicken, service, and prices.",

His response was unexpected but much appreciated. I do not live near a Viva Chicken but, thanks to Mr. Garcia's email, the next time I have the opportunity to give them another try, I will. Customer service is important. And, who knows, I may adjust my review for a 3rd time ... hopefully moving up to a 5 star rating :) Fingers crosses :) ---- Okay, so first off the app doesn't work then the website doesn't work so I call the restaurant to place a to-go order. A man picks up, asks if I can hold, which I foolishly agree to. After being on hold for 5 minutes, my friend and I decide to drive there to place our order - I do not disconnect from the line. At 14 minutes on hold AND as we are walking in the door, the man returns to the line to take my order. I explain that I am walking in the door right now and will place my order inside. The girl at the counter is super-nice when she takes our order. I ask to talk to a manager. The man comes over and I explain all of the above ... and he could not give a sh*t. He does insincerely apologize and then TAKES A FREAKING PHONE CALL WHILE I AM TALKING TO HIM! And never returned to me to conclude conversation once he got off the phone. I will never return to this place.",

    "text": "I had heard great things about Viva Chicken so I was anxious to try it out. I went for lunch today and I was BLOWN AWAY!!!..:and though the food is good, that wasn't the (main) reason I was.  The reason is because this wonderful young lady named Flavia was so helpful!  She did her job, and WAY above and beyond it!! I can not recall ever having service like that at any restaurant. When I arrived, I was not sure of what I wanted and informed her that this was my 1st time here. She asked me what I was in the mood for and explained many of their offerings. You could tell she didn't just work there, but also enjoyed the food she spoke so highly of.   Flavia took my order and then brought me over to sample some of their signature juices (I purchased the Herbal Limeade). I ordered the 1/2 chicken meal  since she said I would want to take some home. My sides were the plantains and chicken soup. I also ordered the veggie Arroz Chaufa rice and the Tres Leches cake for dessert.    Flavia's assistance didn't stop there. Once I sat down, she brought me out some sauces to take home with my to go order, and grabbed me some to enjoy with my meal. She also brought me some cutlery and napkins, and checked on me throughout my meal to make sure I was good!  The food was very good...very flavorful and I loved all 3 of the sauces. They complimented the meal very well.   Flavia also brought me out a yuca fry to try, which was good.   I was full and so glad I stopped in today for lunch here. I'd visited another Peruvian restaurant and their service/attitude was nowhere near as top notch as what I experienced here. Also, and for me this is big, they are not willing to share their sauces. For your meal you *might* get 2 small cups that are half full, but any more WILL cost you!! I so appreciate having the option to enjoy all of the sauce I care for at Viva. Thank you - you have no idea what you've done by providing that option, but my guess is if others have tried that other restaurant and then come here like I did, they will stick with Viva!  I will definitely be back...again, of course for the food, but ESPECIALLY because of Flavia. You are a True gem, and I really thank you for making my first experience a really enjoyable one.",

I paid $22.00 for this delicious feast!!  The chicken was absolutely perfect!!  Very tender and juicy inside, yet perfectly roasted outside!!  The white rice was as good as white rice can get, next time I'll try their seasoned rice (can't remember what they call it).  The Yuca fries were very good and so were the maduros.  But the star of the show was their dipping sauce!!  The mild sauce was fabulous and was a big hit with us!!  Overall, I think it's a great place, well-priced and they serve delicious food.

The sauces are all so tasty and not as spicy as they claim (but I like spice). Didn't love the fruit side, but that was my fault for ordering a fruit cup! Sweet potato fries were also delicious. Very crowded during lunch but still remarkably fast and reasonably priced. I'll be there again!",

I went in several weeks ago expecting the usual tantalizing sauces, perfect flavors in bean side dish and perfect rice (I get the quarter chicken meal with cilantro rice and bean sides) - I was soo disappointed!   Trust me I know how it should taste like since I used to frequent them(this location and near uptown) on my lunch breaks. The sauces were completely off :( no tangy kick only super salty green sauce. . No creamy goodness -I couldn't even eat the yellow sauce. The chicken piece seemed more fatty , the rice had bigger pieces of carrot and seemed off in flavor as well. Beans were definitely lacking!  This was one of the biggest disappointment . I guess I will see if the Elizabeth location is still good. You don't understand how addicted I was to this plate/food/sauces. Maybe they are expanding too rapidly with many locations and aren't doing enough quality control ?? :(",

I'm going to forego too much of a description and rather give a PRESCRIPTION for eating at Viva chicken.  (Briefly, decor is Chipotle-eque and price is somewhere between cheap and moderate).  Here's what you need to do:  1.  Don't eat lunch.  You need to prepare your body for the experience.  A light breakfast is appropriate but you must cleanse yourself before the transformational experience that is Viva Chicken.  2.  Order the Arroz Chaufa with pulled chicken.  Order a side of fries.  Order a soda.  Close your mouth and step away from the counter, lest you alter from this path to glory.  3.  While waiting for your order collect some of each of their sauces, your fries will serve as little more than a delivery method for these delicious spicy ambrosias.  4.  Upon the arrival of your food turn off your cell phone, breathe deep and consume the deliciousness until sleep or exhaustion overtakes you.  Good luck traveler.  The journey you embark on shall change you to your very soul...",

It was more than enough to feed a hungry family of four, and we even had leftovers.  I did a takeout order online- and arrived early for pickup but they were able to deliver quickly! Extremely fast and friendly service- they were able to have it ready 10 minutes earlier for us.  The chicken is well spiced and not dry. The sauces are amazing, especially the green one. They aren't too spicy like hot sauce, but instead are very flavorful and have the right amount of kick.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but definitely worth it. We used to like a Peruvian place called Genaro's but it closed down and this is a great replacement for our rotisserie cravings.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch twice in one week and loved the food both times! I had the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides and the quinoa stuffed avocado. When I was ordering I thought 1/4 chicken was actually 1/4 of a chicken but when my food came it was only a thigh... which means next time I'll be getting half! Or maybe split a whole chicken if I came in a larger group. I also got the herbal lemonade which is VERY basil-y and rosemary-y so I drank some and then diluted it with some water and it was still pretty strong. I'd still recommend getting it because the flavor was so unique. Probably my favorite part of the meal was the sauces though. The Aji Amarillo is so good I would eat it by the spoonful if that were socially acceptable. None of the supposedly spicy sauces were very spicy however which was kinda surprising. For dessert, I tried the churro and the tres leches cake. The churro had filling which made it a little too sweet for my taste but it came piping hot which was nice. I like that the cake comes in a container because I took it home and devoured it when I wasn't so stuffed. SO GOOD!!! I loved the whipped frosting because there were granules of sugar mixed in that gave it a slight crunch. When I came on a Thursday around noon the place was PACKED and I had to wait maybe 5 minutes before I got a seat but I guess that's what happens when a restaurant serves addictive food. Also, maybe because the restaurant was so crowded but it was really loud inside which is my only real complaint.",

    "text": "I'm addicted to Viva Chicken.  For months, my husband has been encouraging me to have a meal here. His work caters Viva Chicken frequently and he always raves about the wraps and green sauce.  So two weeks ago, we went to the Elizabeth location. I was IMMEDIATELY hooked. I have even dreamed about the place! Since then, we've been 2 more times (Cooper Way location). The Naked Peruvian wrap is amazing, as are the quinoa avocados and ever single side I've tried (hint: they're all delicious).   I would smother that green sauce on every single thing I eat for the rest of my life, and it still wouldn't be enough. I crave it like nothing else.   Yesterday, my husband texted me and said he was headed to Viva Chicken for lunch, so I put in my order. Well, he seemed to have missed the text so he graciously offered me the other half of his Naked Peruvian wrap that he didn't get to finish. He then told me that giving up that food was one of the hardest things he's ever done in his life.  So yeah, you all have something amazing going on. If I was a millionaire, I'd buy a franchise for the end of my street.   Thank you for delicious, healthy, AMAZING food.",

    "text": "We LOVE this place! My husband and I tried this place after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. We had no idea it was an order at counter type of place and thought it was a sit-down waiter service type of restaurant. Loved it so much we have been back almost once a week and brought our children. Although it is order at counter type of establishment, the employees will come check on you and take away empty dishes. Food is great! We are not vegetarians but are trying to eat less meat so our favorite dish is the Audualian (sp?) salad. It has quinoa and avocado. Their sweet potatoe fries are crispy, fresh, hot , yummy!! Their roasted chicken is tender, seasoned well, delish! The place is always crowded and we know why. The value is great. A family don't have to break their bank to have a nice delicious meal with family. My mouth is watering as I'm writing this review. Love their drink choices too! Great job! You raised the bar for other eateries. Open more Viva Chicken, PLEASE!!",

    "text": "As the current Duchess of this Viva Chicken location (& I don't even eat chicken) I guess it's my duty to finally write a review!  I've been in here quite a bit since last April, around the time I started going to the Greenway nearby regularly. I usually start at the Piper Glen side & turn around once I get to the Johnston Rd bridge, but one time I decided to keep going ahead. After a certain point, there was a fork in the trail & I had to pick left or right? I picked left & about 5 minutes later, I knew I had made the right choice.. Because I was starving & once I went up a hill, I saw the back entrance of Viva Chicken!  Anyway enough about that.. You just want to hear about the food right? My go to for awhile was the Andina Power Food. It has everything I like in it! Kale & romaine based with avocado, edamame, red bell peppers, \"seasonal fruit\" (which is always oranges apparently), and sliced almonds. The only thing I could do without is the quinoa.. For some reason I'm not a fan & I think it's because of the heavy cilantro flavor. I prefer the balsamic dressing (the one on Quinoa Stuffed Avocados) over the passionfruit vinaigrette it normally comes with.  Another item I've been getting a lot lately is the Inca Wrap with Plantains. The wrap is so good & filling, with cilantro infused rice (I know I've been hating on cilantro but I feel like the flavor is more subtle in the rice), salsa criolla, avocado, & canary beans. After a few bites of the wrap, I take a bite of plantain so I can have a bit of that sweet & savory action going & I like to save one plantain as a \"dessert.\"  Their juices are also tasty & sometimes I get all 3 because why not. The Maracuya (passionfruit) is delicious, but compared to the other 2, it's a bit boring. The Chicha Morada has some kind of spices in it that makes it a unique drink, but the Herbal Limeade is my favorite! It's refreshing & has hints of basil & rosemary in it, which sounds weird but it's a real treat.   Sauces are all good as well. My favorite is the Aji Amarillo (yellow) sauce. Idk what's in it & it's the mildest one but it's so tasty! The Gringo Killer (peach colored) sauce is my 2nd fav & honestly I don't think it's that spicy. Huacatay (green) sauce is my least favorite because of the strong cilantro presence but I do enjoy it in small amounts.   Food comes out relatively quick & service is on point. It's a great rest stop for me before I head back to the Greenway & walk an hour to my car. Thanks Viva Chicken!",

I'm not sure if I would put this place in the fast fold category per say but I can understand if others do. It's very convenient and worth every cent. It has me interested in actually trying authentic Peruvian food. One of the things I love most about this place....THEY SERVE YUCA. I don't know if it's just me but I've had a hard time finding good yuca in Charlotte. I used to always reminisce on the ones I would eat in Miami with hopes of going back. However, I have tried a lot off of their menu from the arroz chaufa to tacu bowl to the naked Peruvian wrap...typically all with yuca as the side. They also do serve good fries and plantains just not my primary choice of a side. You cannot leave this place without also trying one of their many sauces or homemade juices. If it were up to me I would recommend the red sauce(which is the hotter of the three) and the maracuya(passion fruit drink).",

    "text": "Very modern and clean interior. Open and spacious dining area, which is definitely needed because this place is insane during lunch time!  Ordered the Peruvian Rice with Chicken and a side of Plantains. Food came out very fast and smelled great as soon as it was on the table. Rice was cooked great and a good mix of color and different crisp veggies that all worked well with the chicken and rice. The plantains were delicious! Definitely going back for more!  One thing that was a bit of a shock is the price, I thought 10+ for a Fried Rice dish a la carte was a bit much, that is until they bring it out. Take my advice, bring a friend and split an entree. Wow, normally I wouldn't be bothered by so much food but it was a TON and I wasn't really in a situation to take any to go. I'd estimate it was 1-1/2 to 2 lbs of food.  Only real complaint I'd have is that I thought their tea (half sweet/unsweet) was a bit weak in my opinion. That being said a lot of places around Charlotte over-brew their tea and you end up with a bitter taste, so I'd rather have under-brewed than over brewed. Just a nit-pit, your mileage may vary.  Make sure to give their pepper sauces a try near the soft drink machine. They have a mild, medium, and hot. The hot is nicknamed \"gringo killer\", don't let that stop you! It's not extremely spicy and gives a nice bold-tangy flavor in small quantities.  Looking forward to lunch again soon!",

One  orders at the counter and then gets a table and waits for their order brought to the table. Atmosphere comfortable.  The restaurant features chicken which is hormone free, marinated 24 hours with Peruvian spices and then cooked in a charcoal oven.  The menu not only features their chicken with several sides but also a variety of salads soups , sandwiches and wraps plus a  kids menu. Even vegetarians will find something on the menu.   A nice variety of sides which feature: green beans, canary beans,  rice ,sweet potato fries, French fries  quinoa,  plantains   yuca, chicken soup , house salad and fresh fruit.  Prices are reasonable, food is plated attractively ,comes out hot with good portion size.  We ordered the quarter chicken with 2 sides. Everything was tasty and quite delicious.  We would certainly  return and try something else from the menu.",

The chicken is tender and flavorful. Many excellent sides to choose from. We especially love the Yucca. The dipping sauces are the bomb (I know, no one says \"the bomb\" anymore but I grew up in the 90s).   We forgot to get a receipt while we were there for reimbursement through the job. I called weeks later and spoke with the the manager, Fernando, who was happy to assist with looking up our order and texting the receipt to me. I worked in restaurants for years and know that kind of call can be a bit annoying. I really appreciate the excellent, professional service.   We now live less than five minutes from this restaurant and it's one of our favorites. Keep up the good work, Viva Chicken!",

    "text": "Viva Chicken in the Ballantyne area...  same great menu as all the other locations, just different venue.  This shopping center is pretty popular across from Earthfare and also is home to the round-about that no one knows how to use properly, but there's a Midwood Smokehouse location here along with other stores of interest so its a prime location for Viva Chicken to be in.  Once you survive the parking lot, the front door has a set-up of rails like a Carowinds ride (for dine-in)... and then there's a separate register/pick up for online orders to the right near the drink machine.  Makes for a weird flow and there are two separate doors for each area...  probably makes sense when they are super busy, but I dined in and constantly saw people wandering in and not knowing where to go from the entrance.  Staff was nice and the food came out fast per usual.  The dining room has a smattering of tables and the high ceilings makes for some noise, but overall it's a great option for the folks at Ballantyne.  Looks like there's a covered outdoor seating area as well, but there weren't many people cause it was a cold day when I went.",

The servings are pretty hefty- my husband and I split the 1/2 chicken and 2 sides and were stuffed. In the past I've tried the sweet potato fries, the fried plantains and the regular fries. All excellent side choices. Today we went with a little cleaner option and did green beans and chicken soup with our half chicken. Still yummy! Their juices are soooooo good! You'd never think to put some of the flavors together the way they do, but it works.   My absolute fav thing is the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken. Holy crap. Add a little of the red sauce and that's what I call a meal. Oh speaking of sauces- literally you could not like anything on the menu and dress something up with one of their sauces and rejoice. Just excellent.   All in all, this is what I would call Peruvian comfort fast food, and they do an amazing job.",

They have a decent sized menu, which in my opinion, has something for everyone. I nanny for a family that has 3 kids and the kids jump for joy when they get Viva Chicken for a meal, it is actually used as an behavioral incentive to do well throughout the week.  I always get the rice add chicken, everything in it.  That included eggs, green onion, peppers and the added protein. Their soup and quinoa is also to die for.  My sister also enjoys eating here and she is a vegatarian so, it's always nice and convenient to find a place that has something for her that I like a lot as well. My boyfriend does not eat food like this and I made him try it one night and he literally loves it. Never an objection from anyone I know when going here!  SIDE NOTE: you must try all the sauces!! They are amazing (red=spicy,yellow=medium,green=flavorful, not hot)",

What really ruined my experiences was the climate control issues.  The first time I went, we sat inside and there was no A/C.  Mind you it was early July and about 80 degrees inside.  I could barely eat my food I was so uncomfortably hot.  A month later my husband talked me into giving them another shot. On the plus side, the have added wall mounted (close to the ceiling) A/C units.  The down side is that they are set on an oscillating mode, so every 30 seconds you find yourself in the middle of an arctic blast.  Each time, my napkin would go flying off my lap to the floor.  My husband likes their food, so I will probably return to this restaurant for him.  Otherwise, I would never chose on my own to return.",

You can always tell when a restaurant is doing a solid by the amount of clientele you see, and Viva Chicken is very popular!  A little bit crowded, but the lines to order move quickly.  I ordered \"The Great\" sandwich on ciabatta, with their Peruvian rotisserie chicken, assorted salad green lettuce, tomatoes, lime-pickled onions and what they call a \"rocoto mayo\".  On the side I got an order of French fries and their \"Aly Amarillo\" sauce.  Food quality, presentation and flavors were all TOP NOTCH, I can't recommend this sandwich enough!  My associates also got their Viva Taku Bowl and the Classic Saltado.  Very good flavors and presentation, they agreed.  Atmosphere is a modern layout with rustic tinges, from the wood-bottom chairs, metal stools and antique filament incandescent lights overhead.  Clean layout, but can be a bit loud.  They also have a covered patio they enclose in colder weather.  Would be awesome on a spring/summer day for a good lunch or after 5 meal.  Several varieties of beverages including a few regional Peruvian favorites.  A few options for beer/wine as well.  We all agreed we would be back, and recommend them highly for a quick, flavorful and healthy meal.",

I'm usually more adventurous.  But Viva can even make a chicken sandwich really wonderful, hence the name...Yucca fries were hot, crispy and not greasy.  They must keep their fryer at the right temperature - something busy lunch restaurants are often challenged with. It's a counter order place where they give you a number and deliver your order.  I'm a little weary of this service style, but whatever works.  They were busy, and it didn't take long at all for our food to be delivered.  Employees are friendly and helpful. I plan to try more of the menu soon.   Now that you've read how I can go on and on about a (anything but) simple chicken sandwich, don't you want to try Viva too? :)",

    "text": "Viva chicken is definitely good, I've been to other Peruvian restaurants the only one that is as good as here is genaros. The first time I got the 1/2 chicken with infused rice and sweet potato fries, the chicken is very moist and tastes great, the infused rice is full of flavor and the sweet potato fries are pretty good too. The have three sauces, a green, yellow, and red sauce, red being the spiciest and down in heat to yellow then green being the least spicy, they are all very good. This time I got the Arroz Chaufa, my sister got it last time and it was a little salty so all you have to do is tell them to be light on the soy sauce and it is delicious, and then you top it with some of their sauce and its even better. Oh and I can't forget the passion fruit juice! You have to get some no matter what! It is sooo good. So if you want some chicken, come to Viva Chicken!",

    "text": "What can I say about Viva Chicken? Total yummers! Every time someone in my office walks in with this for lunch, I know where they went and start craving it as well. My coworker introduced me to this restaurant and I'm hooked!   Before visiting here, I had never had Peruvian food. I have to say, it's a new favorite of mine now. Their chicken is so good, but I usually don't order the 1/4 chicken and 2 sides, unlike my friends. I'm a little bit more adventurous and it has worked out in my favor here, with the exception of the herbal lemonade (VERY herbal, just not my style and not for the light of heart). The quinoa stuffed avocados are SO yummy. I could make an entire meal off of two of these, but I never do because I can't resist the cilantro infused rice every time I go there. It's some of the best rice I've ever had. \"The Great\" is also a winner in my book! Hold the onions, please. Choose ciabatta bread or a wrap -- whatever floats your boat.    The chicken is an honorable mention, but the True star of the show at Viva is the Aji Amarillo Sauce...soooooo good, I can't even describe the flavor goodness, but I've ever had anything like it. This sauce is truly addicting!   The parking across the street is a bummer, as the lot is usually full at lunchtime. Come early -- it's worth it!",

    "text": "This place gets a 2star from me on technicality only. The food was good, the service was okay. What really ticked me off about this place was the  process and thoughtlessness. I order $50 worth of food for me and a friend. The food comes with drinks that they fill the cups with the beverage of choice up at the cash register. I put in two orders with two drinks. They served me the drinks up at the register, one with a lid and the other without (disaster waiting to happen). I also order Tre's leche cake for desert. The manager assists the lady at the counter in putting my order in and gathering it together. He gives me my drinks and cake and also a number so they can identify who ordered the food when it's being delivered to the table. I pay and head into the dining area to find a seat. 5 minutes into waiting for the food, the manager makes his way to our table to tell us that he had given us the desert (1 Tres leche cake) but the girl up front didn't ring  it up so we hadn't paid for it. He admitted that it was their mistake and asked for my credit card to charge it. At this point, I'm skeptical but I hand him my credit card so as not to make a scene. He charges the card and doesn't even bring back a receipt or anything for me to sign. I was there with a friend and didn't want to cause a scene but my mind was on that charge and how it was done. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but I think it speaks volumes. The restaurant made a mistake, that happens but have some class and don't come back and ask to charge for something that should have been done the first time, especially when we just went through a big ordeal at the counter with miscommunication. I was aggravated, to say the least, at the counter and when he came back to take my credit card, it just show incompetency. Moreover, you take my card and you don't even bring a recipe back?  On top of all these events, as the food is being delivered the $6 cup of uncovered red wine sangria is tipped over bu the server all over my friend. It was an accident and the server was helpful and did her best but there were other staff who just stood there and watched. After cleaning ourselves up, they didn't ask us for we want another drink, I had to ask for it and the server was kind enough to go and get it. The whole visit just set the wrong tone and the visit was just very unpleasant.",

Although, in retrospect I would have gotten the yucca, this place is a must visit while in Charlotte. The portion sizes are generous especially for what you're paying for ($13 for my entire meal). The place is extremely clean and the food was out in less than 10 minutes. Give this place a try!!",

I will start by saying that viva Chicken got my full trust three years ago when these two guys got together and made a difference in their first establishment by being True to their people. You could see the energy in their team. They were always moving around taking food to tables, talking to customers, ensuring the place had energy ...... etc. Last time I was in the ballantyne location I noticed there was a new manager and his energy level was not there. He stood around, walked around dragging his feet, never visited a table, and most importantly- didn't create the energy that I was used to. Luckily, I still noticed a guy wearing a shift lead shirt that was touching all points and a chef in the back of the house pushing his team. I am only writing this because I love this concept and I want you to stay True to what your beliefs were and if there is someone that doesn't carry the same energy that the founders used to carry then they should not be part of this movement.",

If you're trying to eat healthy and want the stuffed avocado order it without the sauce. Still great and I really didn't think it needed it anyway.   Get all three of the sauces and start dipping away. The hottest sauce isn't really hot at all and you'll like the change of pace with each one.

I'm that person who looks at the restaurant menu beforehand so I have an idea of what to order. I thought I was ready but I wasn't...I wanted to order everything! I settled on the arroz chaufa with chicken. Yummmm! The serving was enough for leftovers the next day. I added cilantro on top of my rice to add a little extra kick :). My only complaint is the scarce amount of chicken sprinkled throughout the rice. I ordered sweet plantains on the side; these were perfect! To drink, I chose the herbal lemonade, a heavenly mixture of fresh herbs and lemonade chilled and sweetened to perfection! The overall experience was great. The staff were very friendly and patient.

    "text": "This popular rotisserie chain is always crowded for a reason - it delivers on all counts! The food is excellent, as is the service, and the atmosphere, particularly at this new location in Waverly, is roomy and festive. Compared to its compact location in Ballantyne, the dining room here is cavernous and attractive.  You wait in a small queue, somewhat reminiscent of Disney World, and select your entree from five main categories: Rotisserie chicken (their specialtu), salads, wraps and grain howls. The rotisserie chicken is tender and delicious and has wonderful dipping sauces from mild to hot. Can't go wrong with any of the sides either.  This was our second trip in a week, both on Sundays at lunch time. We tried the Peruvian Fried Rice, the Viva Salad and the Limena Chopped Salad which consisted of Kale Romaine Mix, Solterito (Peruvian Corn, Edamame, Queso Fresco), Jalapeno Bacon, Crispy Chickpeas, Aji Amarillo Ranch Dressing and added the pulled chicken. It ran about 10 bucks. Was excellent but next time I will ask for the dressing on the side and nix the Peruvian corn.   Last trip everyone in my party chose the Tacu Bowl with pulled chicken. It included Cilantro Infused Jasmine Rice, Canary Beans, Salsa Criolla (Lime Marinated Onions and Tomatoes), Avocado, Green Onions. Everything was fresh and delicious. Quantities are substantial.  Everything is also affordable and the place is immaculate (of course, it should be, as it is spanking brand new). In a shopping center full of blase chain restaurants, this one is definitely a Gotta Try! I plan to return very soon.",

    "text": "I stopped by this restaurant this evening to order takeout. When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised that there was only one couple in line in front of me.  I just knew I would be in and out of there in no time. I was wrong!  The couple in front of me ordered and then I ordered and paid for my takeout. The lady at the register was very pleasant and offered to me to have a seat in the takeout waiting area.  10 minutes went by and then 15.  Still my order was not ready. When it got to the 20 minute mark I went back up to the register to speak with the lady I had ordered with. No one was there. There were lots of staff very few customers but no one I could wave down. I went around the corner and immediately asked to speak with the manager.  The man with the dark hair and beard said \"that's me.\"  At this point I expressed to him that I was disappointed. He reply, \"oh this is your order right here.\"  He then said meet me over on the other side.  Why was my food in a completely different area?  I went to the takeout register and the young lady brought my food out.  Again I asked to speak with the manager as I was under the impression he was going to meet me there. I asked her to bring him out immediately. He came out and I explained my concern and issue again.  The manager could have said anything at this point, or apologize.  He said none of this. He repeated himself and said \"well here is your food.\"  This whole time he looked down at the floor and would not look at me and did not say anything.  I suggested to him that this should be fixed immediately.  The other 6 people waiting for their take out we're getting agitated that it was taking so long. I also noticed the couple that had been in front of me we're already finishing up with their meal. How did this happen? I ordered 30 seconds after they did.  this place has some serious work to do!",

Viva Chicken PLEASE come to Miami!!!!!!!! We must have come at a peak hour because the restaurant was packed! The take out line and the order line were to the door. Luckily we snagged a table and I was able to order quickly. We ordered a whole chicken, fried yucca, quinoa, and sweet plantains. The food came quickly and I don't think I took a breath while I inhaled all the deliciousness. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the sides were delicious, and the quinoa is so good I wanted to ask for the recipe. They have a sauce bar that has three different levels of spice for dipping the chicken or sides in. Our service, and  food was excellent and the price can't be beat! love Viva Chicken!!!",

It's very popular so it's usually always busy, but it's totally worth the wait!! I always get the 1/4 chicken with plantains and another side, the chicken is always so moist and flavorful. The plantains are cooked to perfection and even their french fries are amazing. My husband always gets the great wrap, and he pretty much inhales it so that's a pretty good sign. I get the churro every time and it's amazinggggg. There's caramel sauce in the middle and oh my god, it's to die for. The only thing I've ever gotten here that I wasn't a fan of is the limeade, it has wayyyy too much mint for my taste. Other than that, I would highly recommend, I love eating here because it's fast, delicious, cheap and clean eating!",

I like all three but if you like some heat with your meal, go for the red/orange sauce, so good!  But the other two will not disappoint.   My favorite thing to order is the stuffed avocado with chicken.  Filling and delicious!  But of course you cannot go wrong with an order of 1/4 chicken and any of the sides.  Personally, I love the plantains and sweet potato fries.    And while you're at it, try one of the Peruvian drinks!  They are different and pretty authentic to some I've tried in Peru.",

    "text": "If anyone from Viva chicken is reading this... PLEASE!!! Bring one to NEW YORK!  it would do so incredibly well up here!    My husband and I came here for dinner last night.  All I could say is that I wish there was a spot like this in NY!   The main chicken selections are rotisserie style.  I ordered the 1/4 chicken which came with two sides.  I selected the chicken soup based on reviews and the cilantro infused rice.    The chicken was one of the best rotisserie's I've ever had.  I normally don't eat the chicken skin but this time I did, bring it was nice and crispy and packed with flavor.   After you order your meal, over on the side there's a variety of sauces you can try (I have them pictured), the Aji armadillo sauce (mild yellow Peruvian pepper) and the huacatay sauce (black Peruvian mint, fresh cilantro and jalapeno) were my favorite.  I was also a little bold and combined those two sauces together and formed a love child lol.  Seriously- try it!   I topped it over the cilantro rice.    The chicken soup was unlike anything I ever saw or had.  Packed with herbs, onions, chives, and deliciousness.  Initially when it was brought to me I honestly thought it was the wrong order but after further inspection I came to realize how uniquely beautifully this dish was.  Also- don't leave before trying the Yuka.    I hope to come back once more before we go home.",

Sure, they call it something else and it's definitely an interesting idea, combining Peruvian Pollo A La Brasa with the classic Chinese fried rice. They do a great job of it here. Very large portion, very tasty, lots of chicken. Very reasonable price of $10 for the massive platter of yumminess.  They have a soda fountain, urns of sweet and unsweet tea, plus pumps for their three different sauces that range from mild to hot to atomic. I stuck with the mild today. Delish.  My order was ready super quick and brought to my table still very hot on a neat paper plate that went into the bin when I was done. Neat, clean, tidy.",

    "text": "Welcome to Viva Chicken, welcome to one of my top ten favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Viva Chicken in the Ballantyne area is the type of place you go to for Peruvian soul food and I don't say that lightly. My family and I have been going here for over a year and one thing that I can say for certain is Viva Chicken has never once let us down, the meals have always been consistently hot, fresh, delicious and addicting. You just can't wait to come back.  I found out about this place just driving through Ballantyne and if you're familiar with Ballantyne then you know there are many restaurants to pick from. But, I was in the mood for something like a healthy alternative to burgers, pizza and Indian food, so I checked out Yelp, big shout out and found the best reviewed places in the area. Viva Chicken was one of those places and I stopped in.  The customer service is top notch, if there are any problems whatsoever, it's handled quickly and with a smile, the restaurant is always clean and neat; the condiments and utensils are always filled. When you walk in, you're instantly greeted with the aroma of slow cooked Peruvian style chicken, the decor is simple and warm, the seating could be better because depending on the time you come, you may not have a decent seat.   But let's get to the food, I usually order the half chicken with sweet potato fries and solterito. No matter how many times I've had this dish, it's always been delicious. Viva Chicken also has  salads and sandwich wraps but I've yet to venture there yet!! Regardless of what you order, you will be pleased. For the the price and quality of food, Viva Chicken is hard to beat. Check them out when in the area and you will not be disappointed!",

I always get the arroz chaufa, which is basically fried rice, scallions, red peppers and some other veggies, and I choose to add chicken for a small upcharge. It's wonderful, I order it every time and I don't think I could ever get tired of it. I've been to a few of their locations and each time it's been really busy and kind of chaotic with a long line to order at the register and everyone trying to get their own drinks and grab some sauces and napkins, etc and it can be hard to find a table at times. so I would recommend getting a to go order to avoid all the craziness, but the food wont disappoint!",

They had an attendant that checked on us regularly, even though it was a Crowded Sunday during peak lunch rush. The gal that took our order was very helpful, too since we'd never been here before. Only downside was the noise level. Oh, and the bathroom was very clean.",

Anyway found this place off of the highway and decided to try something different. The chicken was excellent. (Hormone free) There were four of us so we ordered the family meal which is a whole chicken cut in quarters and three sides. We ordered rice, salad and fries. It was fresh and other than the fries, something I felt good about feeding my family. Very reasonably priced to. I think the family meal was $23 plus drinks. Would definitely recommend and return again.",

I went on a Thursday for lunch around 11:45 and definitely beat the lunch rush. I stood in line waiting to order for about 1 min and once I sat down I would say my good was out in about 10 mins.   I got the tacu bowl that had cilantro rice, avocado, green onions, tomatoes and I had to add some rotisserie chicken into the mix. I also got plantains on the side and had their passion fruit juice to drink.   The flavors were great and the chicken was juicy. The plantains were pan fried perfectly and the drink was refreshing.   The portion sizes were huge and I had plenty of food for later. I spent around $15 on my meal in total.   It was great, hearty, healthy, and a quick food stop that I will definitely go back to again. And Oh! Don't forget to try their sauces. The yellow sauce was my fav.",

I typically wouldn't order green beans while going out, but the seasoning they add is amazing!! There wasn't much seasoning on their green beans compared to other Vivas. The chicken was a little crispier than usual, but not bad.  One of the things that makes Viva special is their sauces. I feel like they're different at every spot. I usually dip my chicken in the green and red sauce and dump the yellow sauce on my rice. The green and red sauces here were a lot less spicy than at other Vivas, with the red being the spiciest.  This wasn't the best Viva I've had but was still pretty solid! Definitely a good spot for a decent, healthy meal!",

First as a take out from this location, last time, we sat for a casual dinner here, since this place it's kinda of a more upscale fast-food joint.  It's supposed to be Peruvian food, but I'm not sure about its authenticity.  Rotisserie chicken - each time I had it, the chicken wasn't well cooked in my book, pink-ish too. Taste- rather bland.   This time I ordered the Great sandwich on ciabatta (decent) with added avocado (they charge extra). Once again, the chicken could have been better cooked. The sandwich was just OK, I don't think it was that great! I had a side of cilantro rice which is white rice with some veggies, super bland, didn't taste any cilantro. I had to keep putting the house sauces on for some flavor. My husband had the fries with his sandwiches and that was a better choice, they were decent. I can't say their salads are super fresh, nothing to rave about.  Sauces- you need them since the food is bland. The yellow one is probably the best. The green is more spicy and the red too spicy.  The best part for the meal was Sangria, pretty good. Customer service is OK.  The atmosphere (we ate outside) is pretty loud and crazy, people who work here are always around, in your way. The restrooms could be cleaner.  Like I said, locals rave about this place, I can't warm up to it. Not convinced.",

We decided to try out Viva Chicken as majority of our staff hadn't tried it yet. There's not one in Steele Creek yet, unfortunately! And, OMG! My experience from the time I called to place the order til after we had lunch was AMAZING! Seriously the BEST experience I've ever had with a large catering order!  I called and spoke with Diana who took down our order. She was super helpful from the start and made it so easy! Normally placing such a big order is like pulling teeth but Diana made it easy breezy!   When I arrived to pick up my order (early) they were super busy. So I grabbed some of the spicy sauces (mild and medium comes with the order) They ended up bringing out my order ten minutes before my pickup time. I was so grateful for this because traffic was light so I arrived 25 minutes early! They brought my order out in a little buggy and walked it all the way to my car!! She even placed everything in my car with no problems. I tried to help but she politely declined and packed it up for me! What?! This was awesome!!  I got everything back to the office and we all devoured the food. It was phenomenal. What did I find when unpacking the order? A sweet handwritten thank you card from Diana! What an AWESOME touch! No one does things like that anymore and it was so wonderful to receive. TO TOP IT OFF....a little after we finished eating I received a phone call from Diana checking in to see if we enjoyed the meal!! WOW! I was blown away. I've placed many of catering orders and NEVER have I EVER received a handwritten thank you and a call back! I was blown away and so pleased. I will refer everyone to Diana & Viva Chicken and I will be a loyal customer making the drive from Steele Creek to the Ballantyne location.   If you see this Diana, just in case no one told you lately....YOU ARE A ROCKSTAR! Your commitment and dedication to your job does not go unnoticed. You seriously made our entire staff so happy by taking a little extra time for us. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!   Viva Chicken-- don't let this gem (Diana) go ANYWHERE!",

I wish I still loved it as much as I once did, but once the company began it's expansion and opening of many new locations, the flavor suffered. I still like Viva Chicken, and I even like it enough to give it 4 stars, but it's not what it used to be. I now only frequent this restaurant about once ever 2 months, whereas I used to visit weekly. The rotisserie chicken is good, but it used to be amazing. The plantains are still delicious, the fries are just fine. The maracuya (passion fruit juice) is a favorite for the kids. The arroz chaufa with chicken is an interesting mix of Asian and Peruvian, but it's one of the dishes that has lost a lot of flavor. The yellow sauce is yummy, but it also lacks flavor compared to what it once was. The Inca wrap with chicken is my favorite these days. It's honestly still a decent restaurant with good food at great prices, but I'll always miss the amazing food that it once served.",

    "text": "Stopped in at Viva Chicken for lunch with a coworker since we were in the area.  Took multiple trips around the parking lot to find a parking space, when we arrived at 12:45.  Finally Got inside of the restaurant, even though the line to order food was to the door, it moved FAST! Ordering was seamless.    Now finding a table - #savage style!! Good luck when they're busy.  I would hope that they find a better way for seating when all tables are occupied.  A guy literally ignored that I was waiting for the table to be cleaned and proceeded to call his friends over.   Luckily, another table came available a couple of minutes later.   Although busy, our food came out SO fast and it was hot!  I ordered the Chaufa Rice and added the chicken.  Chaufa rice is Peruvian style fried rice.  Very flavorful, portions were plentiful!  My only semi complaint is that it had too many scallions on top and throughout the rice portion (which I picked off).  I ate until I was full and took more than 3/4 of my serving home for dinner.  Crazy to say - it was even better for dinner!!   Guys - the staff!! Insert heart emoji.  They are super friendly, very caring and attentive.  Tables were cleaned off fast.   Great food, food prices were fair ($6-$10 options) and our dining party was very satisfied with their food.  I feel like their menu has something for everyone from salads, rotisserie chicken, yuca fries, fries, rice infused with cilantro, all of which I've had on previous VC visits and loved! I'm always very satisfied when I visit any Viva Chicken Location.    Lost a star due to parking & table/seating situation.",

The arroz chaufa is amazing, all of the sides fantastic...our favorites are the plantains and the yuca fries but we tried them all and nothing will let you down! Wife loves the stuffed avocado and kids loves their fries! Barring the fact that the wait is usually long and the portions have consistently gotten smaller over the years this place is perfect. Decor is nice and seating is comfortable. Order at the counter and they'll bring your food out to your table. Give this place a try for sure!!",

For my very first meal at this upscaled, fast foodie restaurant (yep, you go thru the line...and no tip required), I tried the \"Arroz Chaufa de Pollo\", and YOWZA! It's freshly prepped, seasoned and cooked to perfection...and bountiful as hell! BTW, I thought this place served only chicken, but I was so wrong. Some of the beef dishes that I saw were mouth-watering! I also had to try the little cookie sandwiches that Peruvians call \"Alfajores\"...which turned out to be a pure delight!! And did I mention that they also serve up Sangria?? I went with a large group, and the place was quite bustling...and yet, the food was ready in just a few minutes! I also liked the comfy and casual decor, with a modern edge. Seriously, what's not to like here??? It's ALL so good...and at such a great value! Again, it's a no brainer...so if you haven't yet experienced Viva, GO!!! (I seriously wanna kick myself for not trying this any sooner!)",

Their chicken was moist and flavorful and IH so yummy!  Viva Chicken was good. Just not that first experience good. We got one chicken and sides. The service was good and honestly I should go back and try them again. Theses Peruvian Chicken shops are popping up everywhere.",

For lunch I ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken and picked french fries and plantains for my sides. The chicken was absolutely delicious and so were the plantains. The fries were not your average fries and when you combine them with the house sauces, it's a winning combination. I also had their herbal limeade which was lime, basil, rosemary, and mint.   For dessert I ordered their Tres Leches which is a white sponge cake soaked in three milks. Great portion size and amazing taste.   If I'm in the area, I will certainly be back!!!",

The ambience was good in rustic style of black and brown colors with dim to medium lighting. I took a chicken menu with soup and French fries.  We were given number boards and the waiter came to us with steaming hot chicken in a few minutes. God! They had the best French fries that I have ever eaten. They were so soft and crunch and freshly made. Made me realize how bad the McD fries are. They also had sauce presses and had three kinds of sauces. I didn't know what each of them were but I liked the green one becoz of its tangy flavor. All the three sauces made the chicken even better. Soup was ordinary - big chunks of boiled chicken immersed in spicy water with boiled rice in it. I decided the next time, I will not order soup and instead go for flavored rice. The only complain I would have is that the chicken was a bit too much oily and feeling soaked of oil. It's Rotisserie chicken, can't help. My advice don't order anything more than a quarter chicken if you are a normal being",

We tried again, after a friend told us how great the food was.   We were not disappointed!   The chicken was delicious, the side orders too and portions were generous.  We enjoyed the \"yucas\" (fried cassava).  Never had them so soft before; the Canary beans are somewhat  different (they were a little spicy),  the maduros were overdone but sweet.    The best part is the self-served bar with 3 different sauces. The green one (a mix of coriander, black mint and lemon with a kick), the traditional yellow sauce a tad spicier (made with yellow hot peppers, we detected cummin too) and the  hottest, a pink sauce, the hottest of the three (made from red hot peppers).  For desser we tried the \"alfajores\"; they were the best we've ever had.  Ethereal; not cheap,  they call them shortbread  cookies, highly recommend.  The best deal was the whole chicken with 3 sides  (upgrade for a few  dollars if you want all-white chicken); it is a good deal.     We like Inca Kola, a peruvian soda,  but it is an acquired taste.  Some say it tastes like bubble gum!    Enjoy!",

    "text": "(I'd give a 3.5 if possible.) One side of my family is Peruvian, so I'm very familiar with the cuisine. While Viva is not traditional Peruvian at all, they do have good food for a quick meal. My favorites are their Chicken Soup and fried yucca. There are 2 tweaks I'd suggest. At our last couple of visits,  the chicken -- while still wonderfully tender -- was really lacking the great seasonings that used to be used. Also, with shreds of chicken as large as are in this great soup, you really should provide soup spoons -- impossible to eat without dripping from a tiny spoon.......",

There is parking behind the building, I was just unfortunate enough to make my way there just as a thunderstorm was rolling in.  However, I would probably go to one again. There are so few healthy options for a take out lunch and this fit the bill.",

What a monumental, model-breaking restaurant.   SUPER friendly service, both the manager and several ppl came to check on us, despite again, not having to \"tip\" or feeling like it was owed.   90% of the ppl eating here are not white. I love that its deceptively cheap, family-friendly, yet the quality is super high. Food came almost instantly. Really authentic, juicy Peruvian rotisserie roast chicken, with my favorite sides -- super fluffy crispy yuca fries, delicious caramelised plaintains, an enormous salad with feta and honey dressing. I still can t believe my family ate for under 50 bucks AND we had booze (housemade sangria with lots of fresh fruit, and nice selection of beer).  Homemade churros sealed the deal.   Not to mention the help-yourself sauces, with the green spicy Peruvian mint one being my favorite.",

I would take friends and fam there.  I even once declared, \"I want to marry Viva Chicken\" on Yelp.  But no more. The honeymoon is definitely over. LOL!  The staff has gotten rude.  The management is argumentative, does not value loyalty, and does not appreciate its long time customers. The pricing - which has always been on the high side - for ubiquitous things like rice, beans, and chicken - has increased. The reward point value was slashed. The set up is even more awkward than it was before now that customers have to wait in line to pump their own condiments. And the kicker is that the chicken can get dry and stringy if you don't time your purchase right and you will definitely need the toothpicks they now make available. How disappointing.  Que lastima. :-(",

I heard great things before visiting and had pretty high expectations.  My experience however was underwhelming, to say the least.  The menu options were minimal.  The chicken, not \"all that\".  It was also highly overpriced.  Overall, highly overrated.  Sorry folks, I wanted to like it.. but I couldn't even finish the meal.  Upon leaving, I actually went and ate somewhere else.  Yuck.",

Mine was very very tasty and like nothing I ever had before. There was a good amount of romaine and tomatoes added so it felt like a salad. Service was good. Restrooms were clean and even though it was busy, there seems to be plenty of staff to make sure tables and the wonderful sauce bar was maintained. Definitely will be back to try some of the other things on the menu.",

In a serious lack of judgement, Viva Chicken has eliminated some of its most interesting and delicious menu items.  Gone is the spectacular Maracuya Mousse, the amazing flavor depth and complexity of the Tallarin Saltado, the surprising Chocotejas with their mixture of chocolate, caramel and pecans are soon to disappear.  And the Huancaina!  A Peruvian Specialty.  How and why would you eliminate this classic dish?  It seems like Viva Chicken has opted to go the way of mediocrity and removed many of the dishes which those of us seeking a True ethnic experience have been enjoying.  We were visiting this restaurant from SW Charlotte at least twice a week and spending a substantial amount of money each visit. I can assure you we won't be visiting often unless these amazing items return.  Very sad turn of events, indeed.  Guess I'm going back to Genaro's ...sigh.",

The location is a little bit tucked away, so it's kind of behind Midwood Smokehouse if you become a little lost in strip mall madness.   I certainly agree with the other reviewers that the quinoa stuffed avocados with added chicken is where it is at! I eat avocados pretty frequently, and had never thought to pair them with quinoa. The chicken adds some balanced protein to the meal, so it was very filling. The chicken itself was very good; nice heat and spice to it. I added the green medium sauce, but enjoyed sampling the red and yellow sauces as well. I tried the purple corn juice, but it wasn't really my thing. I wish it was served over ice to help cut how syrupy it is. My mister tried the herbal lemonade, which was more my speed and very refreshing.",

The desserts I could've left... tres leches cake was ok, very creamy but needed more flavor, alfajores cookies (shortbread with caramel/dulce de leche) were extremely crumbly.  Price point is around $10 per person. We ordered the family meal which includes a whole chicken and 3 sides. Perfect amount for 3-4 people if you order drinks or dessert.  I went during Sunday lunch and the place was so busy! Good sign. We found a table for 4 people and squeezed 5. The food came quickly considering the sheer amount of people there.

We both had a few items in common -- the sauce, rice, and chicken soup in common. We were both well before eating and hadn't eaten anything prior. It was so bad I had to get electrolyte replacement from the drug store. It was so severe we kept having to pull over on the side of the road because we were sick :(",

    "text": "Finally today I stopped in to place a take out order. I decided to try the rotisserie chicken - 1/4 white meat with plantains & green beans. I tried all 3 sauces and my favorite is the green Huacatay sauce. This stuff is so delish!  The chicken was perfectly seasoned... it tasted great on its own and with the green sauce. I love plantains and these were very good. I ended up getting green beans as my second side. That was a good choice because they were roasted with little bits of red bell pepper and had a nice seasoning...tasty!  All of this delicious food for only $8.75 (before tax) makes this a nice go-to lunch spot that offers great food at reasonable prices.  I did not try any of their beverages this time since I was getting take out...but after seeing some of the other reviews, I know I want to give some of their beverages a try in the future. (Purple Peruvian Corn and Herbal Lemonade both sound yummy!)  They also have some yummy sweet treats, which I did not try on this visit. But I love Tres Leches & Churros, so I will definitely splurge on dessert on one of my future visits.  If you are just going for takeout, you can order online before you go. However, despite my going in at a very busy lunch hour, I placed my order when I arrived and it was ready in under 10 minutes!  Also, they have a catering menu online so if you if are having an event with 15+ people, they have some nice options starting at $6.50 - $10.00 per person (depending on which package you choose.)",

    "text": "Had to fly down on Super Bowl Sunday for Monday morning meetings that start at 8 AM (who starts meetings at 8 AMs after the Super Bowl???). With a little help from Yelp and friends in the Ballantyne area, ended up going to Viva Chicken just to pick up food.  Now first let me say this, I'm an active weight lifter, so destroying a whole chicken is no problem.  I get them all the time from other latino-infused places....as well as Costco's famous $4.99 whole rotisserie chicken deal.  You may call me a rotisseries connoisseur :) .  So from an ordering perspective, went with half a chicken and two chicken soups.  The chicken was very good.  Perfectly moist, the marinade has the right spices, and of course rotisserie along with the unmistakable taste charcoal cooking provides.  Got all three sauces to try and while I was expecting a lot of flavor, I honestly wasnt blown away by them.  Still good though, but not a sauce that sticks out to me like a good spanish aioli.  Tasted the soup and it is perfect.  This might sound weird, but will be a perfect pre-workout breakfast in the morning to fuel a workout with the rice, veggies, chicken, and broth.  Many of the other sides looked good as well, so future visits will lead to future sampling.  Overall, very good and would recommend it. If I lived down here, I would certainly be a repeat customer.",

Just pull your vehicle around back and avoid the nightmare in the front parking area.  Viva's entry is a bit Showmarsesque...in that you feel a bit packed in a hallway, waiting to get on a ride. However, who doesn't like to get on the rides? The bustling atmosphere of Viva is a combination of their customers and the layout of the establishment. Everything is moving, energy is created...and you feel like you're in a place that is going to offer you something everyone wants.  Fortunately for Viva...we do want it! The food here is great! They are smart in their approach to food here. Rotisserie chicken? How do you mess up juicy rotisserie chicken? Everything they make...they make in a foolproof manner. This is impressive to me...and l enjoy eating at places that have smart people running them.  I could go on about the food...but every sentence would end in, \"perfectly done, great, fantastic, can't go wrong.\"   If you enjoy great food and energetic places...Viva is for you.

The container of beans was 3/4 liquid with about 1/4 cup of beans, if that.  There were only 8 yuca fries and they were very small. but This wasn't reasonable for 3 people, especially given that beans are dirt cheap and I'm sure the yuca isn't  too pricey either.  I've noticed this becoming a trend, and I think when you are paying these prices the portions should at least not leave you hungry.  This is not the first time that I have had to eye the food worried that everyone wouldn't even get a small serving of the sides.  Last time we had guests and had spent a lot, and we barely had enough for a first serving.",

I tried something different today and was very impressed with my order. I started with the half order chicken stuffed avocado. That thing is a pure piece of heaven. It's half an avocado topped with quinoa, shredded chicken and balsamic dressing....yummy! Like every bite was better than the last....and the previous reviews are correct this could totally be a meal! I'd definitely recommend ordering it!   I also ordered \"The Great\" sandwich with Yuca fries. The sandwich is chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, onions a spicy mayo on a ciabatta roll. Another excellent choice....the chicken is soooo good! And they are not skimpy with the amount! That sandwich could really feel two people! Oh and let's not forget those rolls.....delish!!! The fries were a nice addition but I look forward to trying some other sides next time!   Whatever you decide on will be worth every delicious bite! I'm already ready to go back....",

    "text": "After parking our car back by Pike Nurseries and riding our bikes on the McAlpine Creek Greenway, I noticed Viva Chicken in the same parking lot.  I had heard good things about the one in Elizabeth, so we decided to grab an early dinner to replenish our energy.    Knowing it was our first time (and there wasn't a line behind us), the super-friendly and knowledgeable cashier walked us through the menu and gave us tiny samples of their three homemade juices.  Since the rotisserie chicken is their most popular dish, I knew I had to try that.  I also spent the 75 cents more to get all white meat.  1/4 chicken was more than enough for me (although some hungry eaters can get 1/2 chicken).  You get two sides with your chicken meal, so I immediately gravitated toward the yucca fries because of their uniqueness and then chicken and rice soup.  I had the most difficult time deciding between the three juice drinks, though.  All of them were amazing.  I eventually went with the lemonade infused with basil, rosemary, and mint.  I think I could have drank a gallon of it; that's how deliciously refreshing (and also unique!) it was.    After ordering at the counter and picking a seat in the very clean, modern dining room, our meals were brought out to us.  The chicken was amazing.  I don't normally like chicken served on the bone, but I'll make an exception for Viva Chicken's  Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken (Pollo a la Brasa) any day.  It was so flavorful and moist.  To make it even better, we're given two dipping sauces -- a yellow Aji Amarillo sauce and a green Huacatay sauce, both of which I had never heard of or tried before.  Both tasted amazing and offered a little heat.  They were perfect for the chicken and the yucca fries (which were delicious as well).  The soup was good, too, but I could have stood another helping of yucca fries in its place.  (I tried to duplicate them at home, but no no no...)    Anyway, I can't recommend Viva Chicken enough.  It's our favorite new \"fast food\" place for a delicious healthful meal, awesome drinks, friendly staff, modern atmosphere, and a clean restaurant.",

    "text": "The Stuffed Avocado with chicken is surprisingly amazing!  The Arroz Chaufa with chicken is also Very Very Good.  The dishes are made with spices that make a basic dish full of flavor.  The garlic green sauce is also great with the rice and chicken.  Ill post pics next time, yep the food has magically disappeared.",

    "text": "Omg. I have found my heaven! I'd never had Peruvian chicken or food before. I walked in and Christian helped me to pick out infused rice, 1/4 chicken, green beans, and a slice of tres leches cake. It was amazing! The green sauce that came with the meal was awesome. The chicken was well seasoned, green beans were sauteed perfectly, and the rice was cooked to perfection. I have been to this restaurant 5 times in the past 2 weeks! Love it!!!!",
