I ordered a veggie Pizza and the crust was soaked through like mush and burnt at the same time. when I spoke to management about it she stated that the cook said it was too many veggies on it and that's how it turns out. I have had many veggie pizzas made and never had one end up like this. I asked about the free garlic knots advertised on here and everyone acted as if the were dumb. I believe that they are prejudice as they treated me and my beau like dirt. Being that we were people of color. It was horrible. I will never go back and I have never been treated this way in any place in Charlotte.",

We decided to check out the new place on a Saturday night. As always, the food did not disappoint! My husband and I split a greek salad and BBQ chicken pizza. Portions were generous and we love the honey to compliment the crust. However, I was not as impressed with the flow of the restaurant. We ordered at the counter, which was a little awkward because there was a long time but the menus were at the front of the line. Then were told someone would bring us napkins, utensils but no one ever did. We noticed that other tables were being \"waited\" on but not ours. Additionally, we were informed that there was no tap water, just bottled water for purchase. What?! As a place that composts and uses foil and not to-go boxes, I couldn't believe it. We had just walked there and were thirsty. I got over it because I liked the pizza so much! Our next time visiting, we will probably just do to-go orders.",

One of my friends is vegan, and he ordered a create your own pizza, with vegan cheese and pepperoncini. After eating some of a slice, he realized they had added ham to the pizza. He sent it back and the waitress brought out a new pizza with apologies. When he got the bill, they had charged him $2 for the ham! And when he dared to complain about being charged at all, the waitress explained that the manager in charge was not able to give him the pizza free because the replacement was satisfactory. However, they would be able to remove the charge for the ham. Oh really? How nice of you! Unbelievable! This guy is such a sweet guy, and most people probably would have started flipping tables over that comment, but he just very quietly said Ok. We all wanted to throw a fit on his behalf, but we didn't want to embarrass him further since he was already uncomfortable complaining about this, and he was very upset that he had eaten some ham. We NEVER saw a manager or anyone come out to speak to him about this. I am absolutely OUTRAGED that this happened to him and how they tried to act like they fixed the situation by taking the ham off the bill. There were 5 people sitting at our table, and not one of us had ever been to this restaurant before. And not one of us will EVER return. EVER! No doubt they will hide this review in the not recommended category too.",

I wish that I had known about the hot pepper honey sauce because I would have loved trying that. We ordered beer and wine, but needed some water.

In fact, this is one of the most warm, friendly welcomes I've received. The DJ was hip but not so cool he couldn't entertain one of the kids asking for a request. The waffles were as promised, house made, delicious and HUGE! My fav of the stop? The brussels sprouts appetizer which was over the top :) Great brunch on our whirlwind tour of Charlotte.

The pizza is delicious with lots of different craft options but the Tuck and Rolls and calzones are where it's at! The overall vibe is very chill and cozy, not like the high end new shizzz popping up recently.  The specials can NOT be beat! Monday-Thursday you need to be here if you live within 20 minutes of this secret pizza garden.  The servers are especially friendly and cool with a big shot out to Nicole who's usually there Mondays for $1 Copper draft beers!!!!!!!!!!!! If you are close to this place reading my review now and are deciding where to go, you have your decision.",

It's a very small place so dining in isn't really that convienent, so we picked up. First issue was they made it difficult to order online and modify their \"standard\" pizzas but the special instructions box said \"edits to order need to be checked above.\" It was extremely pricey to craft your own pizza, but I went ahead and did it. My husband was going to pick it up and they gave me a spot to put the name of whomever is picking up when I ordered. When he went to pick it up the woman insisted it was under my name and his name was nowhere, but when looking at the reciept it clearly  said \"pick up by...\" clear as day. Got the order and found they left off a topping that they had charged me $2 for. Surprising considering how much delivery they do. I wish I could say I enjoyed the pizza after all that, but it was one of the most tasteless pizzas I've ever had and my husband felt the same way. We didn't even eat the crust (my favorite part) because it was so dry and hard. Way over priced for what you get. If you want Neopolitan style, then Inzio's in South End is far better.",

I stopped in the nearby Harris Teeter really quick and then made my way down the street to Pure Pizza.   It's a small spot right off Central with a matching small parking lot. When I came in, I was immediately told there was a drag show going on. I'm not sure if these events are regular or not but the news took me by surprise and made me wish I could've stayed!  Given the drag show news, I expected that I would have to wait longer since the entire inside seemed to be there for the show. However, my order was ready and I was out the door. I was surprised by how cozy the inside is, much smaller than I was expecting. There's also a small outdoor patio in front with a couple of tables.  Once home, I unabashedly tore into my pizza. The chorizo, radishes, cilantro, red onion, tomato, and cheese made for a wonderfully harmonious flavor combination. I ate the entire small pizza by myself #noshame. Personally, I found the accompanying honey container to be unnecessary. The pizza was delicious without it but I did dip a piece of the crust into it for good measure.  For a small chorizo 'craft' pizza, it was $13 (which includes tax). Yes, more expensive than your regular chain pizza but, obviously, worth it.",

    "text": "INITIAL THOUGHTS: I was pretty disappointed by this place since I had visited their website and saw all the awards they had won so the expectation was pretty high. I just wanted to get the pizza as take out and wasn't staying for a table. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was about 75% full and I only saw 1 server working the whole dining room. So my first impression of the place is that no one is there to greet me or take my order. Maybe people are laid back in Plaza Midwood and don't expect much, but note to owner: HIRE MORE STAFF. The guy at the counter who was actually making pizzas acknowledged me, took my order verbally, and made my pizza. By the time the server actually rang up my order the pizza was ready. So you do the math on how long I waited to pay.   THE FOOD: I ordered the truffle knots and gluten free pizza with chicken on top. The knots were a little burnt, and smaller than your average knot, but you got 6 of them in an order. The sauce to dip them was not thick enough and turned into a runny mess down your hand. The gluten free pizza crust was one of the WORST I have had in Charlotte. It was this puffy, under cooked, looked and tasted like wheat bread. The cheese looked and tasted gross. I picked off the chicken topping and ate only that. I threw the rest of it in the trash and stopped in the Dairy Queen down the road for an ice cream to get the gross taste of the place out of my mouth.    Basicly, bad all around and won't be going back. Waste of time and waste of money. Triple unhappy face. :( :(:(  ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AFTER PURE PIZZA WORKER COMMENTED ON MY REVIEW: For the record, I LOVE pizza! I HATE crappy pizza that I spend my hard earned money on and have to throw out in the trash. My review is clear and highlights their issues so they should work on that. Also, they should be able to handle criticism of their place when there are problems. Maybe they don't care about first impressions and greeting people at the door. You have been warned!",

We have had the shorter, dark haired lady as our server most of the times that we've been here and she is laid back and always makes you feel welcome. (Hey, she puts up with my husband's jokes!)   Our favorite is The Ol Boy pizza. Eggs, chicken, bacon, red bell peppers , onions and hot sauce. After one visit where there may have been an accident with the hot sauce bottle (pizza completely covered in hot sauce) I ask for it on the side. This way the pizza isn't getting soggy also. SO GOOD!! They have THE BEST CRUST and all of the toppings are perfect together.  Be sure to ask for some honey to dip your crust in. It's not Jug O Honey that someone bought from Sams club. It's Cloister honey and after trying it here, I had to go buy a bottle of the bourbon honey.   Also, go for the mimosas. Thanks, Pure Pizza! Everything was great!",

She took forever to greet us and take our order, then didn't check with us after the food came out.  I asked another server to bring hot peppers & parm, but she never did.  I had to order a beer from someone else and waited forever to get the honey after asking for it from our main server.  We had no napkins and didn't get any until we were basically done.  It was a week night, we sat on the patio and it was not busy at all, so I don't know what happened.  The pizza I ordered was good, would've been better with hot peppers and parm cheese.  Also if I got the honey when the pizza actually came out instead of half way through.  This was my first visit to Pure Pizza and I will give them another chanced because the pizza was better than some of the others around.",

If the owners are listening: I think you should be open on Sunday.  Consider this: Super Bowl Sunday and New Year's Day (also on Sunday this coming year) are the top two days for pizza sales in the USA. And as of now, you will be CLOSED for both of them.  Also, you are next to a new apartment building, and there are more apartments being built this year next to them. These are apartments, full of people with an affinity for Sunday pizza.

The restaurant itself is a cute converted house, it's relaxed and welcoming. The music was cool and added to the laid back atmosphere. Service was outstanding!  We started with some garlic knots and a caprese salad. Caprese was impressive, perfectly ripe tomatoes with mozzarella, finished with top notch olive oil and balsamic reduction, and a hint of sea salt which gave flavor and texture.  Then moved on to a pizza with pepperoni with spicy peppers and another pizza with country ham and roasted garlic.  We took a calzone home for later. Everything was great. Definitely will be visiting regularly.",

The Smoked Salmon pizza and Chorizo pizza are both amazing and two of the most unique pies I've tasted. My wife and I always order too much of the Smoked Salmon because we love it cold the next morning. We're also obsessed with their Tuck N' Rolls and Calzones. If you want healthier, their Brussels and Caprese Salad are legit.  In the damn near hundred times we've been to Pure, I can only remember one instance when our order didn't come out perfect, and it was instantly corrected.

I came for a lunch meeting and we lingered for a couple hours, just chatting and plotting to take over the world. There wasn't a crowd, btw. We weren't total jerks, taking a table when others were waiting. In fact, when we left at 3pm, we were the only ones in the place.  From the minute you walk in the door, you're greeted by the smell of pizza crust. Can someone turn that smell into an air freshener for me? Seriously. My mouth started watering immediately! I had grand plans of getting a salad but the minute I smelled the baking dough, it was a lost cause. Pizza all the way!   I ordered the Chorizo pizza and regret nothing! It was delicious -- greasy chorizo balanced with sliced radish, red onions, fresh tomatoes, cilantro and a lime wedge that I squeezed over the entire thing. All on the sprouted ancient grain dough because that's healthy, right?! It was such a unique flavor combination and I loved every bite. In case all that wasn't enough, they also offer up Cloister Honey to dip your crust. I had the bourbon honey. It was totally gross. Trust me. You shouldn't order it. I'll just take on the burden of eating all the bourbon honey for everyone. ;)",

The phone was answered by a frazzled employee who ultimately hung up on me.  I'm still in shock at the complete lack of professionalism she exhibited.  Their pizza is good but the service just lost them a customer.",

I ordered the She-Rex pizza. I really enjoyed this 10 inch pizza with what is basically a salad on top of a pizza so you can trick yourself into thinking it's healthy haha. But underneath is the cheesy bready goodness of a pizza with onions and peppers. Very enjoyable! Plus they brought two little containers of honey to the table, which was meant for putting on your crust. One was traditional honey and the other was cinnamon sugar honey. YUM!  The atmosphere was very country and welcoming. Semi reminded me of a small town restaurant in Italy. They aren't trying to impress you with a fancy ambiance, it's all about the food. Not that the ambiance is bad, but it's not the focus.",

Anyway, unlike the 7th street station location, this is a sit down restaurant with table service. There's seating in the from to rooms to the right and it looks like a bar in the back.  The best thing to come here for is pizza although there are other things on the menu like calzones, salads and sandwiches. They feature fresh and healthy ingredients here so you cannot go wrong with anything. On the table, they even have a little card that tells the story on where their tomatoes come from.  On this visit, I went with the Geno D's pizza which was absolutely delicious. Loved the garlic flavoris and the bite size toppings. The dough is amazing here. It's the only place where I actually enjoy eating the crust of the pizza. The only fault here is that the pizza was a bit soggy but why eat pizza if you don't expect to get messy?  Good stuff Pure. It's a shame I do not live closer.",

    "text": "Pure Pizza marches to its own drum, and I mean that in the best way. I happened to be in town overnight and my BIL is currently living in Charlotte. He said PP is one of his favorites and so, we had dinner here.  First - I love the space. It's a converted 20's bungalow and I have much love for old spaces that are well used and preserved. There's a big takeout counter when you enter and a hidden (tiny) bar toward the rear - in front is a lovely patio. Apparently when it's \"nice\" (ahahaha it was like 65 out and I guess that is \"cold\" here) the patio is packed. Anyway - PP has a special every night and just my luck, Thursdays is \"kids eat free\" - hooray? Actually, it was fine because it seems like people in Charlotte actually parent, and don't let their kids run amok like at home.   Second - the food is really tasty. I ordered pizza because the place is called Pure PIZZA and not Pure Sandwich. You can get anything in a 10\" which is the right size for one person or you can go buck wild and get a big pie to share. Mine was delicious - crisp, chewy crust, fresh sauce and just a bit of spice. Apparently there is honey to dip yo' crust in? Must be a local thing but we weren't offered it and I surely did not miss it as I ate every bite of that lovely, airy crust as it was - unadorned and beautiful.   Third - service is...well, it's something. Kind and welcoming for sure. Perhaps a tad...absentminded? I mean, they want you to be happy. Everyone is nice. They're just on a different time zone? Be patient. You might have to ask for a refill more than once, but come on - where else do you have to be?   Pure Pizza is delicious for sure. Come armed with time and a sense of humor and prepare for some good eats. Also, don't be parking in the VFW lot next door - you've been warned and they have a cannon.",

Very compartmentalized, so even in the biggest of the dining areas, you're still in a small area.   The food dominates. For a legitimate meal, The Pizza Peel and Pure Pizza are neck and neck for best pizza in Plaza, if not Charlotte. My first visit was a quick pick-up and I got \"The Lulu\" which has jalapenos, bacon, ground beef, tomatoes, and pimento cheese. So good. Like a spicy pimento cheese sandwich with a ground up bacon burger on pizza crust!  This past visit we dined in. They have a lot of local beers, so I asked for a sample of one. Turns out they didn't have any clean sample glasses so our waitress (Sarah) brought out a free half pint for my fiancee (also Sarah) and myself. Sarah (the waitress) was very attentive and helpful. Sarah (the fiancee) and I both had some questions which Sarah (the waitress) answered amazingly. I decided on the \"Pepperoni Supreme\" which WAY exceeded my expectations. Delicious pepperonis, pepperoncinis, pickled red peppers, and (even though it wasn't on the menu) banana peppers.  Cannot say enough good things about Pure Pizza. If you haven't been already, you're really missing out.",

This was a pleasant delight with fresh locally grown veggies and a side order of Brussel sprouts that was so good. I give it a 2 thumbs up and can't wait to try their other pizzas on the menu.  I wanted pineapple which they don't have because it is not local to the area, as the server advised me.  She  suggested the balsamic glazed w pesto, since I wanted something sweet. I did hold off on the onions.  My friend bought the lasagna like pizza, don't know what it is called because he is a regular and didn't request it by name.

    "text": "Not to be confused with Pizza Peel just down the street, Pure Pizza is a larger location for their restaurant located inside the Seventh Street Market.  Pure Pizza is housed in Lulu's former spot, a small house off Central Avenue (with a small adjacent parking lot).   When you first walk in the door, it smells absolutely amazing.  Pure Pizza has a great vibe, with awesome rock music, and tables situated so that it has a really cozy feel.  My husband and I both ordered 10-inch pizzas, including the margarita pizza and the T-Rex.  Their pizza crust is very thin, and they cook the pizzas well so they are extremely crispy.  While not like the usual margarita pizza (with sliced whole milk mozzarella and fresh tomatoes), Pure's margarita pizza was still very good.  Mozzarella cheese covered the pie, and their tomato sauce tasted very fresh. They also topped the pizza with fresh basil.  My husband's T-Rex pizza was full of meat, and very good.  We debated whether Pure Pizza was better than Alino's in Mooresville.  I prefer Alino's, as it's more of a True New York style pizza (i.e., large and foldable) , but my husband prefers Pure Pizza because the pizza is crispier.  I'm just glad we've found another option for great pizza in Charlotte!",

We really wanted to try something different and signature for Pure, so instead of creating our own pizza we picked one from the menu.

Often when you take away the bacon the dish loses its flavor, but not in this case. Then I had a custom pizza with vegan cheese, bell pepper, and arugula. The pepper was somewhat sparse but not a huge deal. It was very good. The crust was clearly fresh. They tossed a bit of olive oil on the arugula which was a nice move.  The staff seemed quite bored and not exactly thrilled about working but alas. There was a rambunctious group in the back but nothing egregious. My only real complaint is that their music was far too loud, especially for 6pm on a Monday night. Otherwise, I recommend this spot and will definitely go back!",

The floor shook tremendously with each step the waitresses took. Overall it was okay but I don't know if I would pay the prices without the groupon deal.

I got the She-Rex which had an assortment of veggies (peppers, onion, mushrooms) with greens tossed in a lemon vinaigrette on top. The pizza itself was delicious and I especially loved the crust. The greens on top however had an overwhelming taste of vinegar. The dressing was too acidic and needed some balance. My boyfriend got the Slap Yo Mama Lasagna pizza, which may have been one of the best artisan pizzas I've ever had. Definitely ordering that next time!",

Unfortunately I forgot the (V) on the menu meant vegetarian not vegan. After taking a bite of the pizza I realized what I had done. I forgot to ask for vegan cheese. Our server was really nice about it even though it was 100% my fault and she quickly brought us out a new pizza.  The pizza was amazing. I loved the thin crust. Definitely recommend. The food is great and the customer service is amazing.",

Started with garlic knots as an appetizer courtesy of Yelp. The knots were fresh, hot, and had a perfect ratio of garlic and oil on top. Beer selection is local and the taps are rotating. Even have some cool cheap Italian beers. Got the Geno D's pizza. Perfect amount for two grown men looking to wreck some pizza. I'm not a huge crust critic but I have to say this crust was delicious. Perfect amount of chewy as well as warm and soft. Our waiter was awesome and didn't slip once. Pure pizza I'll be back, stay groovy",

It took us probably 10 minutes to figure out what we wanted to order because we were trying to decide whether we wanted to do the special which was A one topping pizza with a pitcher of beer for $33 ( fridays and I think Saturday's only) or try one of the specialty pizzas. Our waitress was very patient with us while we asked lots of questions.We ended up trying the not yo mamas lasagna pizza with pepperoni and the Lulu without jalapeno. The Lulu pizza was good, but I preferred the not yo mamas lasagna pizza. It was delicious! The crust is crispy yet fluffy and has a good bite to it. They also give you honey to dip your crust in which I thoroughly enjoyed. You can bet that will be back!",

My wife order a gluten free pizza, which she said was oks we are still trying to find a place with a good gluten free pizza. The journey continues.  My pizza was good. Not memorable, but good.  Our waitress seemed a little off. Almost like she was new to the occupation. Not very with it, but my wife and I were happy, so it was all good. I'd like to recognize Tina, an employee that came by and chatted us up. She was very friendly, and I would actually come back to hang and talk with her.  She should be lauded.  Will we come back? I doubt it. Too many choices around town to settle for an ok experience",

The chorizo is my favorite. I know it may sound like an odd pizza, but it is absolutely delicious. Pepperoni Supreme and Smoke Salmon are also two of my favs. This is one of those places that I don't think you can really go wrong with any of them. My roommie loves the Tuck N Rolls (we usually get buffalo chicken). Gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian menus are available.  Back to the honey, ask for it. You'll want to dip your crust in it. Trust me. You're welcome.   Make sure to follow them on IG and check out their events calendar. There are always great specials and/or events every day. Parents, note: kids eat free on Thursdays.",

They have a Bloody Mary bar with all the go to's!    Bummed I had to send my food back not once but twice for an raw/under cooked egg. After the 2nd time I was hoping for something new but they brought back my omelette microwaved another time. I would get pizza next time as hubby raves about it. Disappointed I boxed up the now over-cooked half-picked at omelette.   On a better note, Hubby had bacon, egg cheese pizza the \"hoofy \" he loved it!   It's a great space , locally -sourced farm to table, good beer selection and outside seating. Will be back but maybe not for brunch for a while.",

Side note they usually have great salads and always very fresh ingredients. This order was just really off.  Reply to owner: The picture shows a togo container because It was delivered. I was in the middle of moving and didn't have time to call and deal with it. It's not a negative review it's a neutral review. I spoke highly of your food and ingredients 'normally'. A negative review would have consisted of me slamming your establishment and being hateful. I posted a picture because maybe you should ask your kitchen staff \"who eats that many raw onions on anything???\"",

Both locations have their perks but this one feels more intimate than an open market. Great drink specials through the week, and the pizza is soo good. Snag an order of garlic knots (free when you check in on yelp) and get the Pepperoni Supreme. Garlicky, hot peppers, and crispy pepperoni. The crust is perfectly chewy and you can fold this pizza, without losing all your toppings. Can't go wrong!",

The marinara sauce with the knots was legit, and we made sure to keep the leftover to dip our pizza, too.  I had a side caesar after the knots and before the pizza that was pretty good as well. I think it was butter lettuce in the salad which I'm not a huge fan of, but the salad was cold, served in a cold bowl, and the dressing and croutons were good.  On to the pizza. The way the pizza is made, I'm not sure exactly how to classify the style, but I know it's what I look for in a pizza and it reminds me of what I used to eat growing up. Flavorful but not overbearing toppings/sauce with a slightly thinner than your regular hand-tossed crust that ends up being super crunchy. It's an A+ pie in my book.  I got the Slap Yo Mama Lasagna pizza that included Tomato sauce, Mozzarella, Ricotta, ground beef, onions, garlic, herbs. It was SO GOOD. Nothing too fussy but still a ton of flava in ya ear.  Going through the menu, there's also a good variety of vegetarian and gluten-free options if you're into that kind of thing. My girlfriend got the She Rex - Mozzarella, mushrooms, onion, peppers, topped with greens tossed in lemon vinaigrette, and the slices I had of that were also real good.  The next time I get pizza that is not way way too late been drinking too much pizza, it's 100% going to be Pure Pizza.",

    "text": "I really really really wanted to LOVE Pure Pizza. I love everything it stands for, with the local ingredients and the laid back vibe. I loved the servers, who were very down to earth and friendly. The only problem, we really did NOT love the pizza. :( The ground beef on my husband's pizza was very bland, even for someone of milder taste. The gluten free crust (which I know can be more difficult to make at times) was totally soggy and lacking in flavor as well.   Two things we did really love were the garlic knots (delicious! coated in real garlic and olive oil) and the salads. The salads were a good size, fresh, and full of delicious flavorful ingredients. They were basically the opposite of the pizza.   I'd consider coming here again, but only for the salads and appetizers and maybe a drink. Definitely not for the pizza.  At the end of the day, if I spend $15+ on a personal pizza, I expect it not only to have top notch ingredients, but to taste delicious too. Walking away from our meal (garlic knots, brussel spouts appetizer, two salads, two personal pizzas, and one beer each) we did not feel like what we got was worth the $90 bill.   If they work on the gluten free crust texture and the flavor of the meat, that would seriously improve things. The vibe of the place is phenomenal, as were the garlic knots and the marinara that came with the knots. The rest just paled in comparison.",

I arrived around 9pm but my pizza was already luke warm...I expected better for a $29 pizza. This might be one of those pizza joints where it's better to dine in. The pies are thin (which is how I prefer them) but those tend to cool very quickly and are much better served piping hot.   I would like to go back to give this place another shot but will be dining in. They have daily specials so be sure to check out their website for those.   TL/DR: Dine in for best quality",

I love the food here, and unlike its 7th St. Market counterpart the stand alone complex on Central Ave. is perfect for a quiet meal in a comfortable enviorment. The complementary honey burbon sauce is the perfect compliment for lonely pizza ends.  It's a self serve restaurant with friendly wait staff that ensures prompt and reliable service.

The ambiance is very casual but artsy, the servers are just really cool but attentive. On our second visit, my husband and I got the margerita pie as well as a smaller buffalo chicken pizza which was bomb! They also have a pretty impressive beer list! We are big Burial Brewing fans and they often have cans of the not so widely distributed stuff which is pretty cool. Both times I've come was on a week day and we didn't have to wait at all which was nice. Not sure what nights are the busiest though. If you are a Resident Culture fan, they deliver right to RC which is pretty cool!",

    "text": "Pure pizza is a beautiful place with high ideals and high standards. I love what they stand for and what they do, especially for patrons with food allergies.  I have gotten pizza and salad from their 7th st market location several times over the years and I've always been impressed.   When the new Central ave location opened we were freaking out to try it. We knew the restaurant would be mobbed the first couple weekends so we placed to go orders instead.   I got the gluten free Margherita. When I got home and opened it looked like heaven - soft crust, yummy looking cheese and sauce. One small problem - there was no \"GF\" sticker or other indicator so that I knew I had actually gotten the GF crust that I ordered. This is a little scary for people with allergies because you just have to hope they got it right. Which I did. I tried to call but no one picked up. Plus the pizza looked so great I really didn't want to turn around and drive all the way back to ask.   Well, it was absolutely delicious. Very flavorful, but I got pretty sick pretty quickly. The next day was tough and I blamed myself. They just opened, staff may be making more mistakes, you should've double-checked, I thought.   So I gave them another shot a weekend or two later. Again we picked up, again there was no GF sticker on my box...but this time when I opened it, it was 100% clear I got the GF crust. It looked nothing like the first pizza. The crust was very thin, small, no chew, no fluff, looked like it had been frozen maybe - it was pretty dried out. So, disappointing in a different way. Or maybe getting a non-GF crust the first time (which was amazing even though it hurt me) set me up for disappointment when I finally got the real GF deal.   I still plan to give Pure Pizza my business in the future. They work so hard and care so much about the food they make. I'm just giving this location a bit more time. I do wish they would use GF stickers or some sort of indicator as many other restaurants do to help out the people who order specially prepared food.  ***i appreciate Juli taking the time to respond, it shows a lot of care given to customer service. That said, my 3 star review was not based on getting an incorrect pizza the first time, or hopes of getting GF stickers on to go pizzas - which I did try to call them about, but got no answer. My review encompassed my experience so far with this location, but the star rating was based on the actual GF pizza I got the second time. I also don't think that 3 stars is bad, but a rating of fair. I gave their other location 5 stars based on my experiences there, and plan to update my review of this location based on my future experiences. Just trying to help others who will eat there make informed menu selections. No free pizza needed, but thank you.",

Had not eaten lunch but needed to shower and get going since I had somewhere to be for 6:30. At 8:30 we made our way back to where we were staying in the plaza Midwood area. I was a starving by this point. I was super excited to see that there was a restaurant saying they had fresh ingredients and gluten-free options. Even gluten-free garlic bread with marinara, how cool is that. So my son and I head over there... by this point it was around 9:15 and I was excited that they were going to still be open. Again we are starving and preparing to eat like kings. We order the pizza that has all the meats (i dont remember the name) on the gluten free crust as well as an order of the gluten-free garlic bread. I have to say I was shocked that it came out maybe 4 minutes after I ordered it. How do you cook a pizza and garlic bread in such a short time. Well when I took the first bite it was evident. I don't know how they cook this thing but I'm not exaggerating this was the absolute most disgusting gluten-free anything I've ever eaten. I took one bite of the garlic bread and actually spit it out into my napkin. I don't know how to even begin to describe the flavor of the crust. It just tasted like spongy something that had absorbed weird flavors that had nothing to do with a pizza or garlic bread. I turned my attention to the pizza which visually looked amazing but again it was on the same crust. It was so so so disgusting. I would say maybe it was just me but my son had the same look on his face like what is wrong with this pizza. We even tried to just scrape the toppings off of one slice and even that was just not working for us since somehow the toppings were cold.  We decided to just pay and go home hungry. I asked them to take the garlic bread off the tab since we literally didn't even eat it. They did and we paid the $16 for the gluten free pizza that we also barely ate. Maybe it's just not for us and I'm sure by other reviews that their standard pizza might be okay crust might be ok. The waitress told me I might would want to come back to try their salads, said they were delicious.",

Highly recommend trying the honey with your pizza.   I do think they should have servers instead of ordering at the door then sitting down since the line can get long and there's not much space by the register.",

I ordered a deconstructed pulled pork, a mushroom appetizer, and a side salad for my pizza. When my pizza got here it had this super bright purple coleslaw, and as a picky eater I stared at it for a good few minutes before deciding to take a tiny, dainty bite and found it was actually really good. The pizza was great! It had a nice chewy crust and excellent amount of cheese, my only complaint was the coleslaw got a bit runny and made some of the slices a little soggy (hence the 4 stars, which really I wish could be 4.5 but whatever). The mushrooms were fantastic as well, really enjoyed the cheese that came with them. Salad was okay, but only because I like to pretend like I'm healthy when I eat a salad but really cover the whole thing in dressing. If I were at the restaurant I would have asked for a lot of extra dressing, so it's not their fault that I had a dry salad with all those \"vitamins\" and \"minerals\" or whatever the kids are calling them now.",

The shop is tucked away in what looks like a little house on Central Ave. It's cozy but small. The menu featured a special where you can get a large pizza + pitcher of beer for $33. We asked our server about it and told her we'd like to do that, and ordered a large wild mushroom and small T-rex with a pitcher of beer. The wild mushroom tasted good, but the mushrooms were very unevenly spread. The slice that I pulled out only had one mushroom on it. When the check came, they had charged us $10 higher than what they should have with the special. When we asked the server, she said \"of that's only for a one topping pizza.\" We paid anyway, but then she came back and said it was her mistake and that we had talked to her about it before and she had confirmed it, so she adjusted the check. Also, when we asked for the honey/cinnamon sugar dipping sauces, they said they didn't have any but they had wildflower. I asked what was wildflower, and the response I got was \"oh it's honey.\" Then why are you confusing me by saying you're out of honey? The whole experience was just a little bit bizarre. Maybe they still need to iron out some things, but we will stick to the 7th St Market location, thank you very much.",

Our server was ok- she seemed busy but I could tell she really did intend for us to have a good experience.   The con: Went I went to use the restroom I noticed only two choices: unisex and women. I looked around and just couldn't find a men's. Now if I missed it please let me know and I'll edit this post; however, it didn't seem there was one. I can understand attempting to be inclusive of all people as the sign in the unisex restroom said, but I can't get down with being inclusive by excluding other people.

I had the she-Rex on ancient grains crust.  It is the best \"whole wheat\" crust I've ever had- not greasy or dry!  The pizza had amazing flavor, topped with the perfect amount of toppings!

    "text": "After my initial review, I decided that I erred by not airing our grievances to management \"in the  moment.\"  In my defense, there was little opportunity to do so but I should have dropped-in or phoned when the situation was not as chaotic.  Almost immediately I heard from Manager Julie who expressed a genuine interest in learning more about our experience that night as well as an eagerness to make it up to us.  I appreciate such attentiveness and will definitely patronize Pure Pizza again and soon. I will do so because of Julie's concern and willingness to make things right.  The above rating reflects solely the food from that evening which was delicious.  After my second visit, I will update my rating to reflect the entire experience.  Many thanks to Julie and even more kudos for her superlative customer service.",

The roasted Brussels Sprouts were a big hit at out table as well.. The veggies mostly come from Windcrest organic farms in Monroe.. This place is 100 % amazing..",
