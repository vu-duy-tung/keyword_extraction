    "text": "This place is somewhere between a three and a four star place but gets the \"local bonus\" for a place that is just around the corner (if you're in Mint Hill), has wonderfully friendly staff and prices that don't have an uptown Charlotte premium on them - meaning: this place is really cheap compared to city places!   The food was slightly above average quality for this kind of place and I like that it also accomodates people who prefer a somewhat more healthy choice for their meals. They have vegetarian things and a raw vegetable side (nothing fancy, but hey, at least it's there).   The restaurant/bar is nice looking, clean and fairly modern, and on most nights it's pretty busy, so people must like it! Good place for a simple, affordable weekday meal out.  TAKEOUT: I don't think I'd recommend getting take-out food from here (which they do). I was in the restaurant one time when an unhappy customer came back and returned a bag of food he had no ordered. One time I did get takeout, it was all cold ten minutes later when I got home, because the hot sandwiches are not wrapped in foil or any other way that would keep them warm, and a friend's philly cheese steak sandwich had *zero* cheese on it.",

I've had the wings as well as the fried pickles. The wings are well prepared (a little on the smallish side) and with every Thursday the wings are only 50 cents which is a pretty good value. Nothing really notable about the friend pickles. The drinks as well seem to be reasonably priced so you can go in, have a meal and a couple cocktails and still get out for under 20$.  The inside is fairly basic. Bar to the right, seating to the front and left and kitchen and bathrooms in the back. A couple big screen TV's and jukebox. Still though, it feels comfortable and welcoming.  The service I've had there is pretty much average. Same server both times and she got the orders right checked up on us as much as we needed but wasn't overly friendly or neglectful either way. The owner (or general manager?) did stop by and check to make sure everything was well which is good to see that they are paying attention to how everything is being run.",

Fries with Bacon and Cheese, the Fries tasted great, were crisp but light on cheese and bacon. I would have added more and gotten it through the Fries more not just over the top. The Wings were mild as asked, so right on with the heat, good flavor but ours were a little overdone. Moist chicken is preferable to crunchy for us. Onion petals were good but not home made, so you can't go wrong there. However....they had the absolutely most amazing burgers! My favorite was the Hills Piggy Burger, with Swiss, Tomato, Mayo. I think to have it with onion would have over powered the meat and egg flavor. They did an awesome job, juicy, nice size portion and great flavor. They weren't crowded and the noise level was fine, staff friendly and attentive. We will definitely go back again, to try a few more sandwiches to see if consistent. You can get bar type foods anywhere, but a great burger/sandwich is hard to find and nice to know where to go when you want a quick bite to eat. I think we'll try them for Lunch next time!",

It wasn't as busy on the inside as the parking lot would have you believe, because the lot was full but there were still three or four free tables, but it was a sunday night, so I imagine Friday and Saturday it would be full to capacity.  I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich and a beer and was satisfied with my meal.  The fried pickles were a good appetizer too.

The Hill is nothing fancy. It's a neighborhood pub through and through, and that's not a bad thing. Their menu consists primarily of appetizers and sandwiches, and they have a great selection. My wife had the cheesesteak sandwich, and it was great (I ate half.). I had the fried bologna sandwich, and I enjoyed that as well. I can appreciate any menu that even includes such a sandwich. There were a lot of others on the menu that I wanted to try, so that made decision making difficult.  The beer selection was decent, with the usual domestics and some local varieties from OMB. Bring in some Birdsong!  Finally, the service here was great. It took a few minutes to be seated, but that was because our hostess was also the bartender, our server, and was bussing tables. Despite having so many jobs to do, she did them well and was very friendly.   I'll be back!",

I originally ordered the zucchini burger but they came back several minutes later and told me that they were out so I ordered the veggie sub. I wasn't all that pleased with the sub but it could have been worse. I ordered the homemade chips as the side which were delicious. I would love to go back and try the burger some other time.

We have encountered neglectful service on several occasions. The staff was nice, but it seemed that every time we needed something, they were hanging out and talking at the bar. Also, we have called in to go orders a few times... once they said it would be at at least an hour...they were \"really busy\". Then another time we called to order food around 9:20 on a Saturday night and they said they couldn't take our order because they were \"just closing early\" because no one was there. Their hours are until 10:00. Either the manager/owner doesn't care or she/he needs to hire new staff. We went elsewhere, where we got good food and were satisfied_ @ Dunwellz.",

A sign was up saying to wait to be seated, and we did. In fact, we waited quite a while, and although the staff was milling about and one employee even came over to adjust the TV right beside us, no one offered to seat us or even greeted us. They were busy (they always are--there's not many options in Mint Hill), but it seemed rather egregious, so we left.  Last week we decided to give them another try. This time we went for lunch, and were greeted by a sign instructing us to seat ourselves. We did and were promptly served. The food was better than I was expecting (the fries were excellent and my turkey Cuban sandwich hit the spot), and our waitress was friendly and attentive.   The first experience was 1 star; the second was 4, so I'll give them 3 overall. The Hill is worth a try if you're in the area. Just be ready for some bumps if they're overly busy.",

Just the right blend of hot and sweet.  The Hill Burgers are a crowd favorite.  Big and juicy and fixed just the way you want them.  The Crab Cakes are delicious.  My wife is from Maryland's Eastern Shore and these are the only ones that she'll order out.  The French Dip is big and meaty.    Get there early and beat the crowd.

Our server Jayden was super awesome. The place was about halfway filled with customers. It was a nice Sunday vibe.   We started off with an order of fried pickles. YUMMY! I ordered the zucchini burger with sweet potato tots and my husband ordered the Cuban with pasta salad. The food was DELICIOUS. I have never had a zucchini burger before so I was very interested in trying it. It was beyond my expectations. My husband enjoyed his food as well!   Our order came out pretty quickly. I think we just found our new Sunday spot. Can't wait to come again.",

Soft and crispy at the same time and very flavorful- like a sweet taste. The side salad was big!

We started with their wings (Hill Flavor) and they were FANTASTIC!! Great fried wings that had a grill char to them before a sweet and spicy sauce topped it all off.  I then ordered the pepperjack steak and sandwich which was the special of the day. I don't like mayonnaise so I aksed them to keep that off the sandwich which in turn made it over all pretty dry. The meat and bread were both good quality, but then sandwich as a whole wasn't my favorite.    If you're going to get a side... get the Fried Pickles.... TRUST ME!!! They were hot and fresh and delicious and you can tell that they were actually battered in the kitchen and not frozen.   The only downfall was our drinks.. my draft beer was quite flat and my friends red bull /vodka took at least 15 minutes to make it to the table and was pretty much just the can of redbull poured into a regular ice tea glass.",

They have a nice bar as well, and the interior is decorated in such a way as to encourage you to be comfortable and enjoy yourself.     The owner really believes in customer service too, the one time I had an issue, he apologized, fixed the issue and comp'ed the entire meal for both my date and I, despite me telling him that it was not necessary.

I researched this place quite a bit and felt it would be a great choice for a night out. I was disappointed, the place from the start was empty eventhough it is a small space.

    "text": "Service was painfully slow on a Friday night. We were seated right on top of the air vent so it was blowing cold air on me. Then it took our waitress forever to bring refills. She was really sweet and apologized for the 45 min wait. The Italian sandwich was just okay. They literally put it on a smooshed hot dog bun. I didn't pay $8.95 for a hot dog bun sandwich.  Drink specials are worth it, just not the food.",
