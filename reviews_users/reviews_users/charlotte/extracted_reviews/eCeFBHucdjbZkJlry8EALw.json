    "text": "Papi Queso is definitely an adult's grilled cheese & I am proud to say, \"I am hooked!\" I can't believe it took me so long to try them out, but thankfully they were at the Southend food truck event on a cool fall Friday night.  I went for the Little Muenster & added bacon. While there was a minor mishap that took some time - a teenager took my order by mistake - an employee made up for it by not only giving me the teenager's order (a French Onion), I got my order, as well. This is customer service, folks!   First off, their truck is gorgeous; it's black & orange, which you can see from afar.  Their employees...so friendly! The branding of the sandwich boxes, which feature a mustache stamped on the corner, is absolute genius!  Now, the sandwiches...oh my! Perfect grilled bread on a flattop, with a beautiful golden brown color. The cheese...oooey, gooey, stretches- out-when-you-bite-into-it yumminess!   I am definitely more than a fan...they've become my favorite food truck!",

This is gourmet grilled cheese with difference cheeses and added  ingredients.  So far I've had the Pimiento and the Southwest.   The Pimiento gave me a new appreciation for pimiento cheese and the the Southwest had so much going on that the flavors were dancing in my mouth.  Staff is great here too.  Yeah, Papi...keep it up!!!",

I had the regular grilled cheese and added tomatoes. They had run out of bacon before I could get some on mine. It was still good, just not for $6. I had their kettle chips, which were slightly sweet and almost reminded me of Old Bay Seasoning. They were good, but once again, would have preferred more considering how much they were.",

    "text": "I guess I'm being the gluttonous American here, but for $10 ($8+tip), I guess I'm expecting something with a little more heft?    Very nice service, a mild wait, but certainly not unreasonable.  And what sounded like an incredible grilled cheese sandwich.  Local smoked mozzarella, fresh made salsa verde, sounded awesome.  So I just felt a bit letdown when I opened the box to find a standard square grilled cheese, that, from the outside looked like what I could make at home.  Basic white bread, no cheese spilling out the sides, just a square cut into two triangles.  It tasted very good, not OMG-greatest-grilled-cheese-ever, but very good.  The mozzarella was delicious.  But it literally took me about 90 seconds to eat it and I wasn't eating that fast.  I guess what I'm asking for is a massive upgrade in BREAD.  Why not some big, thick slices of sourdough?  Then you could pile on more cheese and the bread would hold up.  Or at least make that an option for a buck or two more.   Food trucks are all about getting your grub on, and in terms of portion size, this just didn't do it for me.  If that's not an issue for you, then I think you'll love this truck.  Menu very appealing and service was great.",

What I didn't realize was that it had Mac and cheese on it which was just a little bit of over kill ....for me, add the pork butt and buttery fried bread.  It was all too much.  It was tasty but just a little too much.  The wait can be extremely long too which kinda took away from the whole experience and I wasn't impressed by the basil lemonade.  It was good but not great.  The food truck bar is high these days so forgive me if I'm being super critical but standing in line for upward of 30 mins for a grilled cheese sandwich with Mac and cheese and some tasty porkbutt (see I'm fair!) and tepid lemonade is just not my idea of a good time.",

It's not worth waiting this long for a Pig Mac but it was ok for me since I was visiting from California and I'm not downgrading them based on the long wait. The sandwich was great and first time I've had this kind of clever combination of mac & cheese, pulled pork, smoked tomatoes, and grilled buttery bread. I'd expect a creation like this in a SF Bay Area food truck scene but kudos to Papi Queso for putting this out there and representing the Charlotte food truck scene.",

Jalapeno Mac - this is a featured sandwich.  It has a pepper jelly, Mac and cheese, jalapenos, sweet tomatoes and onions.  Very nice combination.  I took the onions off because Im not a fan of them.  But for those onion lovers.... Keep them on.  All of my friends love this sandwich with the onions. :)",

My only response is that you need to try their menu and get back to me. Because this is by far my favorite food truck.  I swoon at the thought of the leek and mushroom sandwich, or the one with smoked tomatoes, or the one with avocado and other green stuff. And it's not your average cheese that they're using. Their ingredients are strategically sourced to deliver an astounding flavor profile every time, with every sandwich.  There's a bit of a wait, which I count as a perfect opportunity to munch on the truffle potato chips. My only complaint about the chips is that they don't come in a 5 gallon bucket. So stinking good.  I've tried a lot of food trucks in my day, but the quality ingredients, consistent vegetarian options and finger-licking good sandwiches at Papi Queso make it my top choice in town.  And I bought a t-shirt. Long live the cheese stache.",

All stainless steel and chef's coats and proper restaurant line cooking. Also, they accept credit cards.   Cons: the flavor of the sandwiches is lacking. I wish they used some sharper or stronger cheeses. Here's what I've tried:  LITTLE GREEN MUENSTER: having learned from a previous experience that the sandwiches were a bit thin and needed more filling, I added jalapenos and mac and cheese to the muenster, spinach and avocado. What made this sandwich better than the others I've tried was the horseradish. It was creamy and flavorful. Had I not gotten the extra fillings, I feel like this would have been an extremely thin showing.   JALAPENO CHEDDAR: jalapenos, cheddar, bacon and jalapeno jelly. Too sweet, not enough spice or melty-ness. See photo for how minimal the fillings are.   FRENCH ONION: Swiss cheese, caramelized onions. No balance. All sweetness. Needed some sharp cheese or sauce to balance the flavors.",

    "text": "Papi Queso - My first food truck experience in USA. Today noon, i came out of office to buy lunch take away & this food truck was just parked at the entrance of my office. I wanted to try foods from food truck from the day i reached US, but i happened to notice just today, So i made my mind 100% to try here.  Papi Queso serves mainly the grilled sandwiches & I went with Pig Mac($8), out of the few options listed on the menu. Packing was good & the staff was friendly & took around 10 minutes to prepare. Pig Mac is nothing but Mac'N'Cheese+Carolina Pulled Pork + Bourbon Onions on grilled bread slices. I was initially little disappointed to see just 2 slices of bread, but while having, i realized that it was heavy with huge quantity of pulled pork & macaroni. I have liked every bite of the sandwich, the pork & macaroni combination was very tastier. It was top notch preparation.  I would love to check other sandwiches also, when i get next chance. I would highly recommend this others as well.",

I debated between the Big Cheesey, the leek and mushroom, and the #PIGMAC.   I went with the #PIGMAC sandwich, one of their most popular items, for only $8. It has Mac and cheese, Carolina pulled pork, and bourbon caramelized onions. I also tried the kettle chips seasoned with rosemary, Parmesan, lemon zest and truffle oil. The sandwich was delicious. All of the items compliment each other really well. The chips are also very flavorful. I'm glad we came on Saturday, I heard the line is an hour long on Fridays. After tasting the food, I understand the demand.   I also liked that you have the option to add smoked tomatoes (+$1) and/or bacon (+$2). Sounds like great toppings for the big Cheesey...I'll have to give it a try next time. They also sell a tomato soup which I'll definitely try when it gets cooler.   Great food served by friendly staff! Add this place to your list of food trucks to try.",

The Pig Mac is a combination of pulled pork and Mac n cheese in a grilled cheese sandwich.  Here's my only suggestion: I think pimento cheese would have been better than mac n cheese due to the spice factor.  The pulled pork is sweet whereas I prefer an Eastern style.  Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was excellent and I will go back for the other flavor combinations but the sandwich could've packed more flavor.  The soup was perfect.",

    "text": "You know those kinds of meals after you eat it, you're already planning when you can have it again? That's how I feel about the grilled cheese and soup from Papi Queso!  First off, this grilled cheese truck is not your run-of-the-mill cafeteria grilled cheese.  This is nice firm white bread, perfectly girdled on a flat top and holds amazing cheeses and ingredients inside.  None of that processed, cellophane wrapped junk from your elementary school days!    The other reviewers really say it all...so I'll keep this brief.    I always get myself a French onion sandwich which would be awesome with just swiss...but also has provolone and mozz and these roasted, super sweet onions.  MMMMM I want one right now as I type.  I always add roasted tomatos if they're on the menu and get a cup of their tomato soup, which is like tomato candy.  It's soothing and very creamy...definitely not Campbells or anything you had growing up as a kid.   As if that weren't enough, a dollop of creme fraiche and drizzle of olive oil make for a double rich experience. Really, this could be served in a porcelain bowl in a white-tableclothed restaurant.   PS: The bread pudding is a must...and the packaging is adorable.  I won't describe the packaging for you, so you can go see if for yourself.  Track 'em down now!",

I first heard of Papi Queso at a local elite event, but then started coming out to Food Truck Fridays and Sizzlin Saturdays and Papi Queso is usually the truck that has the most people in line.  I would gladly wait for one of their declious grilled cheese sandwiches.  The ooey, gooey, cheese melting in your mouth and the crisp grilled bread that puts it all together makes Papi Queso (I think) one of the best food trucks in Charlotte.  My favorite has got to be the Pig Mac:  Mac and Cheese, BBQ, and grilled cheese delivery form = perfection.  Load that in with a cup of truffle chips - you are in instant heaven.  I've been super impressed by the truck.  The striking black and orange color combo on the outside of the truck and their super organized inside.  They also have finishing details, like the pig stamp on the outside of your box to let you know your PIG mac is ready and willing inside the box.  I know it's probably more for the sake of the friendly and fun Papi Queso truck staff, but I like to think there is an art form to getting/eating Food Truck food.",

Their special, red wine braised short rib with cambozola, caught my attention... Oh man! The short rib was super tender with a slight sweetness from the red wine. It balanced really nicely with the salty, creaminess from the cambozola. I can't wait to try more stuff off their menu!  Just a note... They charge a credit card fee.",

My bf have the smdk flank steak, which I like much better bc it's not as cheese as the other one. The only thing I'm taking a star off for it's the greasiness of the food. It's good for a big lunch, but a big heavy for healthy dinner.   The lady taking order is also very nice, and we didn't have to wait hour for our sandwich like food truck Friday.   I will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu.",

Had the pleasure of checking these guys out at their launch and whilst getting boozy at Triple C. Brian, owner, and his staff are churning out grilled cheese like mom used to make....and some mom has never even heard of.   Gotta hand it the menu for these fellas. You can certainly venture for au originale or something a little more on the adventurous end of the culinary spectrum. Can't say there is anything better than a standard grilled cheese, but the varieties with pork, southwestern chicken, leek & mushroom, and the dessert option with nutella are certainly worth shaking a stick at.   We all know a grilled cheese is best accompanied by soup, chips, or something comparable. Brian has you covered. Rosemary and truffle chips and the tomato soup are available to turn your sammy into a dynamic duo. Pair these jokers with beer from Triple C and you're well on your way to a fine meal fit for the streets of Crown Town.  Prices can seem a little steep at first, but do yourself a favor and talk to Brian or the staff about what kinds of cheese they're utilizing. You'll be happy you did. Also, they have Square, so those of you with no cashola, fear not.   Catch these guys at a food truck roundup or chillin' at Triple C!",

It had pastromi and i swear there was a slice of green apple on it. I bet everything he makes is just amazing.  The only reason I didnt give him 5 stars is because I hear the prices are kind of steep. I think that is because people are looking at it as a grilled cheese but its really is more of a gourmet sandwhich. If I see him out and about I will definately be stopping by.",

The Pig Mac is amazing, I told like 20 people about this grilled cheese, which I call an adult grilled cheese, it was insane. Honestly, I thought I wrote a review after my 1st bite but I'm apparently slipping'.  Imagine this... some pulled pork mixed with caramelized bourbon onions paired with bacon and some good ole' mac & cheese and then more cheese. WHAT?   Just do yourself a favor, order it, then review it, then visit Sycamore Brewing on Friday night for Food Truck Friday and get yourself another one.    That damn bread is amazing too!",

They're on another level of life...   (I have to announce that they have a grilled cheese sandwich with pulled pork and macaroni and cheese... That's clearly my dinner the next time I run into this truck...)  I was initially a little wary after checking out the price board since we all know how much I love a deal... Yep, the sandwiches themselves start at $6 and go up from there... And no.  They do not come with chips... Those are an extra $3...  And since I ordered the Big Cheesy with smoked tomatoes and bacon ($1 and $2 extra, respectively), that put my order up to $12... It kinda made me cringe a little, but I sucked it up... lol  Truly, they had me at smoked tomatoes... I wasn't really sure what that meant, but the flavor of them is unlike anything I've ever had before... It's hard to explain other than just super tasty... I promise if you try them, you will not be disappointed... The bacon was perfect and stood up to the cheesiness without being over or undercooked...  When I tell you they butter the HECK out of that bread, please believe me... When I tell you that they pile that cheese and those toppings on before they grill it into golden brown deliciousness, understand that I mean what I say... And when I tell you that those rosemary truffle crisps are sprinkled with some incredible grade of parmesan, take that and run with it...   Yeah, with the tip, a sandwich and some truffle crisps cost me about $15... I'm fine with that... And as frugal as I am?  That's saying something... lol",

I ordered the Pig Mac which is pulled pork and Mac & cheese between two slices of grilled bread. The sandwich was really good. Both the Mac & Cheese and pulled pork would've been great on their own, and when compressed into a sandwich they were very good. The truck just uses plain white bread, but it gets perfectly toasted and ends up working very well because it doesn't overpower the other flavors.  While the Pig Mac was awesome, it wasn't very large for over $8, and it took almost 10 minutes to make which seemed like awhile (maybe because I was starving). The food was definitely top quality though!",

I've tried to go before but my early lunchtime stomach clock always seemed to be a bit too early for Papi Queso.  This time though both clocks were in synch!  I got the Pig Mac which is a grilled mac and cheese sandwich topped with pulled pork and bourbon onions.  The sandwich was perfectly toasted and crunchy on the outside and had a reasonable amount of filling on the inside that was melty, ooey and gooey the way a grilled cheese should be.  My only request would be more of the vinegary pork and bourbon onions to add more acid and cut through some of the richness of the mac n cheese.  All in all, this was a good sandwich served by friendly folks and I would not hesitate to stop by the next time our clocks align!",

    "text": "We tried Papi Queso for the first time a few years ago about a month after they first hit the streets.... And it has been an obsession ever since then!  It's by far our favorite food truck in Charlotte (and the favorite truck we've eaten at anywhere, really!), and you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The quality of the ingredients that they use, combined with creative combinations, and the buttery crisp perfection of the bread makes their grilled cheese the best EVER!  I know, I know; pretty big statement, right? Well, if you're questioning my authenticity, just try it for yourself and you'll be saying the same thing.  They have a general rotation of gourmet favorites including the Pig Mac and the go-to Four Cheese, but I highly recommend branching out and sampling the Green Meunster (spinach + wasabi + avocado + Meunster) or the Leek & Mushroom (this is waaaay better than the way the ingredients sound, trust me).  If you ever see the Lobstah Mac on the menu, you MUST order it! You can thank me later.  Don't forget to get yourself a nice cold Pellegrino and an order of truffle kettle chips while you wait, it rounds out the meal. Also, don't delude yourself into thinking that you'll only eat ONE grilled cheese --- save time and go ahead and order two. That way you won't have to get back in line later (or share with anyone else).  The staff and chef of this truck are so charming and talented, and you can tell that they are genuinely passionate about their customers and their food.  I can't sing their praises enough, but the best compliment in the food industry is a referral and recommendation, so go check them out!  **Tip: If you aren't into long lines, check them out at Sleepy Poet on Saturday afternoons and avoid the chaos of food truck Fridays.",

Then it happened... we passed the Papi Queso truck while it was heading down Central. It didn't even take a second for Ella and I to look at each other and know a gourmet grilled cheese was just what we needed. We looked up their facebook, followed them on twitter while we were slowly stalking them on the way towards Uptown.   Once they stopped we looked over the extensive grilled cheese menu and ordered the \"Pig Mac\", the \"French Onion\" and some Tomato & Tarragon Soup. Given the miserable weather we opted for taking our grub back home and enjoying it while watching Dexter. With sandwich bliss in hand we turned on Dexter and sank our teeth into our grilled cheese's. Both sandwiches were delicious but one sandwich stood above the other... the PIG MAC!   Its a grilled cheese sandwich with Mac & Cheese , Carolina Pulled Pork, and Bourbon Onions. Charlotte has many amazing food trucks and across the nation some of the best food is popping up everywhere except in a restaurant. If you haven't hit up a local truck lately you should give them a shot :)",

It was very rich but not as seasoned as I wanted it to be. I've also noticed the sandwiches are a little pricey but, considering some ingredients its worth it. I've ordered the green munster both times and I'm not sure how to feel about it. It's extremely creamy from the avocado which is yummy but, also messy. The last time we ordered  from Papi, the bf ordered the Neapolitan Chicken. It was unique with roasted grapes and caramelized onions but, these ingredients also made the sandwich very sweet. The basil lemonade for $3 is delicious! The basil just kicks you as soon as you take a sip.   I'd order from here again but, not too often. It can get pretty pricey for a grilled cheese. They are pretty tasty though.",

The sweetest lady took our orders. I got the tomato bisque special and the bacon jalapeno grilled cheese! The soup was amazing and perfect for the weather. My grilled cheese was good, although I will say, to my surprise, it didn't pack much heat. I know some jalapenos are hotter than others but even someone sensitive to heat could have eaten this. Over all it was delicious, just wish my sandwich had a little more heat!",

It may sound strange but it worked very well and the ingredients they use are all very high quality.  If you see these guys near you make sure you stop by and try one of their many creative options.  I'd like to go back and try a few other options when/if they are near me again.  I also like they offer Mexican Coke in the bottle.  Always a good sign.",

    "text": "Seriously what could be tastier than pulled pork BBQ, sauteed bourbon onions, creamy Mac n' Cheese all melted together in a golden brown Grilled Cheese sandwich! It truly is heaven in my mouth!  I ate what is famously known in the Charlotte area as the Pig Mac from Papi Queso at tonight's Food Truck Friday - South End. It definitely did not disappoint as it was as yummy as always! Seriously folks I go out of my way to stalk wherever they are serving whenever I get a craving and have to hold myself back from having a huge hissy fit when they are closed. It's just that good!  Anyway, the Pig Mac is definitely their signature item but they have many other types of gourmet grilled cheeses as well. My wife got the Little Green Muenster tonight which was avocado relish, a wasabi sauce with Muenster Cheese; this one wasn't her favorite as she felt that the Wasabi sauce didn't really go with the flow of the whole sandwich. However she has had their Mushroom one which she loved!  The only downfall is that they can run out of food very quickly if you don't get their early enough. Tonight they ran out of their Smoky Tomato Bisque and their Pickles. It was sad times not to worry I am still a loyal fan of Papi Quesos!!",

My favorite is Muenster, so it was a no brainer to try the Little Green Muenster. A combo of baby spinach, Muenster cheese, avocado and Wasabi Horseradish sauce. The flavors were made for each other but I could barely taste the sauce and the bread was a bit oily/greasy. For a $7 sandwich I was hoping for a more voluminous treat (aka \"make that thing bigger guys\"). All in all, I would go back and maybe try something different, like the infamous Pig Mac or the Green Chile Cheeseburger. Their drink selections are crazy good - they even make homemade basil lemonade. The house made pickles are killer - I am a sucker for anything pickled! Okay, I'll call you Papi, but just this once!",

I got the GC Cheeseburger, a bag of barbecue chips, a can of Diet Coke, and walked away $13.26 lighter. Honestly, maybe I just have a big appetite (although I ironically ordered Diet Coke), but I feel like I could very easily eat two of these sandwiches. Objectively, it would be fair to all parties if they cut their prices in half, or doubled the quantity provided at the current price point. I mean... really? They charged $2 for a 12 oz. can of Diet Coke.  Anyway, now I need to go get something with more sustenance so that I can finish the work day.",

We put in an order for the Pig Mac (duh.....mac and cheese with pulled pork grilled cheese) and the Mushroom one. Also, ordered a cup of the tomato soup cause it was freaking iceberg like temperature outside. The Pig Mac was heavenly. I mean, this thing is amazing. The mushroom one was good too and a nice balance with the heartiness of the Pig Mac. Though, if I had to just choose one, it is the Pig Mac all the way!

They had sold out of the Pic Mac so I decided on the Mac Melt. The Mac Melt is a mac and cheese grilled cheese. It was amazing. When you think about pasta and bread together it can seem to be a bit much but this was the perfect combination. You could taste the herbs and the huge flakes of salt and it was just the right amount of cheese and pasta. It complimented the sandwich very well.   I shared this sandwich with my mom but I definitely will be getting my own next time. I also hope to give the Pig Mac a try next time. Who can pass up pulled pork and Mac and cheese??

Well, the line was indeed ridiculously long (well over 30-minute wait)...but their \"Pig Mac\" was really good!  Honestly, the long wait ruined some of my enthusiasm for it. As great as the sandwich was, not sure if I'm willing to wait as long as I did for it again. If based on the sandwich alone, I'd rate it all 5 stars, but the total experience was more like a 2 (guess I don't have that much patience?). Also, must add that I was a bit surprised that the sandwich alone costed 10 bucks...and with the chips and drink, about 15. For that price, I could have actually had a nice dinner at a restaurant! So yeah, some mixed feelings on this.  All I'll say is, if you have a good dose of patience and are willing to wait over 30 minutes for a super-good, super-expensive sandwich, go for it!",

The Pig Mac is their signature grilled cheese, featured on Diner's, Drive-In's and Dives. However, the Pig Mac is not just a grilled cheese sandwich. Yes, it is a grilled cheese sandwich, but also includes shredded pork, caramelized onions and macaroni & cheese...yes, macaroni & cheese!!! The bread is grilled to perfection, with heavenly, cheesy macaroni & cheese and the pork, cooked and shredded, which makes for a perfect sandwich !  They also have a few additional menu items and typically have a special sandwich each night! All I can say is if you see Papi Queso on the streets, or at a brewery, check them out! It is worth a taste.",

    "text": "I'm not sure at what point I bookmarked Papi Queso, but I had them on my must try list.  I recently started working in uptown and saw a flyer listing them as a food truck at The Greens on Tuesday, which is only a block away.  Luckily I looked them up on their website, and it looks like they no longer do Tuesdays at all and are now uptown for lunch on Fridays, some number of blocks away.  So on a Friday afternoon we took the trek to find this truck!  Sure enough it was at the corner it was scheduled to be.  There were two that we were interested in trying, the obvious being the pig mac and the other mushroom and gruyere.  It looks like those are permanent on the menu while they rotate others (could be wrong though?)  It took about 15-18 minutes to get our sandwiches completed, with a number of people also waiting.  Luckily they cut the grilled cheese sandwiches in half so I had half of each and my husband had the other halves.  For the Pig Mac - bbq, mac and cheese, onions, and well cheese!  This was my favorite of the two, just loved it!  The Mushroom & Gruyere - mushrooms, truffle spread, and cheese.  This was also very good, cannot complain one bit about this sandwich, I just happened to love one more than the other.  I am definitely eager to go back and try other specials and just get the plain mac and cheese one.  I love a good gooey and cheesy grilled cheese and these definitely hit the spot!    My only complaint, but it is a food truck I suppose, is I just wish there was better availability/hours on weekends so that we can bring family members on by!",

I also had the delectable tomato soup, it was so creamy and warm for the cold nights that have been hitting Charlotte these past months. I also got to try a special featured bacon jalapeno grilles cheese and it was very tasty with a nice kick of spice to it and it had bacon, you can never go wrong with jalapeno and bacon.

The lobster mac (seasonal) is my hands down favorite. They're all delicious- Little Green Muenster, Mushroom & Gruyere. Pig Mac is probably the one they are best known for (pulled pork, mac n cheese, bourbon onions). I love their tomato soup. I always have to order their housemade pickles. Recently, I was lured here by the return of the French Onion. And you're damn right I dipped a soup inspired sandwich into the tomato soup.   Follow them on social media to see where they are every day and to check out the menu.   This year, they were on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri. Spoiler alert: he LOVED them.

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago I saw that they were going to be in one of the Southpark business centers so I figured I'd give them a go. The cart itself is very attractive, actually the main reason this one stuck in my head when I saw the notification. Service counter was nice and clean and the staff was very friendly.  So the food itself: I only got one item from them (because there were other food trucks as well) and it was the Big Cheesy. 3 Cheeses with herbs and sea salt. It was a pretty good grilled cheese sandwich but to me it didn't have any sort of wow factor. It appears from all the other reviews that I should have gotten something with meat to satisfy the appetite because I thought for the price, portion size was lacking. That being said this is one of the most well known food trucks in Charlotte, so yes I recognize their incentive to charge a bit of a premium. Your product is worth whatever people are willing to pay!  The only other drawback was the wait time, it took a good 15 minutes to get the simplest grilled cheese on the menu, from a cart that specializes in grilled cheese. Granted, this was an organized event of 4-5 trucks serving a very busy business center plus people stopping by just for the food.  Trying to stay optimistic because you don't know how badly I want to like this cart! Solid sandwich, just not blown away. I'll definitely revisit and report back on the Pig Mac, the Neapolitan Chicken looks good too.",

    "text": "It is literally unforgiveable that I have not reviewed Papi Queso to date. Every time I have a grilled square from them I regurgitate the story of my first experience long ago. It was on the day of our shortly after they first hit the road grillin' cheese. They parked in the Plaza Midwood lot in front of Bistro La Bon. They were handing out ink pad stamps that looked like moustaches. All the clientele were cautiously having them stamped on their hands. When they asked me where at I said the only logical place for a moustache: my upper lip. The man with the moustache stamp was psyched to have his first volunteer to keep it real. To this day they must still have a picture of my ridiculous face plastered up somewhere on their website. If you see it, know it was me.  Whether your dig is the Pig (Mac), Mushroom & Gruyere or something not always on the menu, you will certainly be blown away by how complex a simple grilled cheese can be. These aren't what your mom used to make with tomato soup for you as a kid. They compile different kinds of cheese with unconventional meat \"formats\" and a veggie or two (gotta get your greens in there!) to make a simple melted-cheese-on-bread into something arguably luxurious. My original experience was with the Pig Mac. Arguably their namesake, it features macaroni and cheese with pulled pork and onions fused together with melted cheddar. They could've just stopped here...but why?? I have zero problems with anything on their glorious menu so I won't complain.  Let's not forget that they now have a semi-permanent kitchen residence over at Sycamore Brewery. (Perhaps the only thing keeping me happy at that brewery, sorry Sycamore!) And yeah, the price on these is a lot to pay for a grilled cheese. I get it. But I eat one perhaps twice a year. It's like a treat. Worth it! They also sell a big glass bottle of \"Mexican Coke\". Meaning real cane sugar. It's the only soda I'll drink.",

The menu offers a carefully crafted selection of different sandwiches, all of which resemble the classic grill cheese. I got the \"pig Mac\" which had BBQ pork shoulder, Mac and cheese, and bourbon onions. I added bacon to mine and enjoyed a Mexican coke. The portion size was great and the service was awesome as well. I was impressed by the flavors and the innovation. Can't wait until next time!",

    "text": "Fans of grilled cheese unite! Anyone can put cheese between two slices of bread, but Papi Queso makes an art out of it. There are many cheesy sandwiches to choose from and each one is infused with a unique flavor. I've had two sandwiches from the food truck. The first is the Pig Mac, which is a customer favorite. It's pulled pork with Mac and cheese. And it is as delicious as it sounds. The pork is seasoned well and the Mac is tender and cheesy. The second sandwich I tried was the Green Chile Cheeseburger. This sandwich is divine and has a spicy kick. I like spice and the  chiles combined with seasoned beef and melted cheese provides a delicate balance of flavors. I actually enjoyed this sandwich more than the Pig Mac.   Sandwiches range from $6 -$9 and that's just for the sandwich.  I wish the truck offered combos with a side and a drink. I don't like purchasing items a la carte. It gets too expensive for me.   I go to the food truck at Stonewall and College on Tuesdays. They do post their schedule on Facebook.  If you can catch the truck at a location near you, give it a try.",

The picture will speak for itself but this is probably the best macaroni and cheese sandwich ever had, including the ones I make myself",

They have mastered the art of the grilled cheese and you're cheese game is lacking if you've yet to visit this truck!   If you like your grilled cheese simple, get the classic and it'll blow you away with the multitude of cheeses that are packed in along with it's unbelievably perfectly toasted crust! Sprinkled with salt and herbs might I add as a finishing touch.  If you're up for an adventure, get the Pig Mac -- what's a better combination than barbecue and Mac n cheese loaded in the middle of two perfectly toasted pieces of bread? I will never be the same and neither will my grilled cheese game!   You can find the truck parked around charlotte (their Facebook and Instagram will keep you updated weekly on where they're scheduled to be), but you can always find them at Sycamore Brewery on Fridays for Food Truck Friday. A nice pale age and a grilled cheese pair naturally well.   Now go on, get your cheese on!",

I can't remember the specific names of the items but mine was the one with BBQ pork, macaronni and cheese with extra cheese and it was absolutely delicious. The other one we had was a roast beef with thinly sliced cucumber and cheese and it was equally as awesome as the first. I also thew a little of their homemade hot sauce on the plate to dip the grilled cheese in and it complimented the sandwich very well. I picked up a bottled water and threw in a 15% tip so my total price came out to a little over 11$ which considering the quality of the food was a very good value. I'll definitely keep a eye out for this truck in the future and if you are a grilled cheese fan at all this one is one you won't want to miss.",

We got the Pig Mac, French Onion (I added roasted tomatoes), the 3 Cheese and the Chicken with roasted Grapes.  All very interesting new flavors, for sure!  My personal favorite was the French Onion, while the Chicken at first bite was quite unusual, but I warmed up to it after a couple of bites.  Not a fan of the Pig Mac w/Mac & Cheese & pulled pork on a Sandwich, but one in our party was.  The 3 cheese was not anything exciting to any of us.  I think I was expecting larger sandwiches and/or a side or drink for the $, so that's why a 3 star, and the wait.  We also got the Bread Pudding, which was delicious!   And the service was very pleasant.",

    "text": "Pig Mac was the best grilled cheese ever...who doesn't like pork and Mac and cheese. Love how they finished it off with a sprinkle of salt on top. My wife got something else at food truck Friday, but she kept sneaking bites of my sandwich because how delicious it was.   Tried the new meatloaf one as well, which was good, but wanted more of a meatloaf taste to it. Was hoping to try the French onion grilled cheese I read about...but it wasn't on the menu this time. Asked them about it and they said it will be back during the fall. Definitely will go back again, just make sure I get to the food truck Friday earlier, because there was a massive line.",

    "text": "I was so excited to be in Charlotte and see this food truck at Food Truck Fridays!  A big fan of anything with truffle oil, I KNEW I wanted to try the truffle kettle chips.  Unfortunately, by the time I got there they were all gone... (of course!)  Instead, I tried a grilled cheese with pear and truffle. (I don't remember the exact name)  but it was the best combination of salty and sweet that all melts in your mouth!  To keep warm, I also had their tomato + tarragon soup... the creamiest and livened up a boring grilled cheese and tomato soup I would normally make at home.  This food truck introduced me to the endless possibilities to make something like a grilled cheese \"sophisticated.\"  My only drawback is that a grilled cheese starts at $5-6?!  I know truffle oil is expensive... but I guess that's what comes with a sophisticated meal, a sophisticated price!",

    "text": "When you go to a gourmet food truck specializing in grilled cheese, you know it's going to be awesome.  I mean, even at it's most basic form, it's bread and cheese which is probably the best combination out there.    My sister raves about this truck so when I came down to visit, she told me we HAD to go.  There was no need to twist my arm about it, so we tracked them down at Triple C brewery one night.  One glance at the menu and I knew what I was getting.  Their special grilled cheese for the night was a bacon, fig, and manchego grilled cheese.  The chef inside told me they put baby arugula on it as well (I'm not sure if he was just excited about the special or warning me so I knew what to expect, but either way I knew I was going to enjoy it).    We sat down inside the brewery and they brought our sandwiches in to us.  Each box is stamped with the papi queso mustache (which is probably the cutest logo ever) and a stamp to show what sandwich you have.  I got to try a bite of everyone's sandwich at the table.  The leek and mushroom was probably my least favorite, only because I'm not a mushroom fan, but it wasn't bad at all, just not my favorite.  Third on the list was the french onion soup grilled cheese.  It had a very mellow, complex caramalized onion flavor which was really, really delicious.  I then had a bite of the sandwich they're most known for, the Pig Mac.  It's easy to see why this is a staple on their menu, pulled pork, mac and cheese, yeah, it was amazing.  But the clear winner of the night was the special.  The smokey bacon, the sweet fig, the creamy melty manchego, and the mustardy bite of the arugula all worked so perfectly together.  I may not live in Charlotte, but Papi Queso is now on my list of \"must-go\" places when I'm visiting.  And if you're reading this, add this special to your regular menu.  Seriously.",

The carmelized onions really adds a great finishing touch to this sandwich which was grilled to perfection.  I had this sandwich at Food Truck Friday.  I waited about 45 minutes in line, but this was worth to wait.  I can't wait to go back so I can try some of the other menu items.",

    "text": "You had me at queso... being a huge grilled cheese fan, this was a must for me. I've had several different delicious sammiches at this truck and of course will be back for me. The Pig Mac is stuffed with pulled pork and onions and bursting with flavor. The French Onion is by far my favorite but unfortunately haven't seen it in months... PAPI! Bring it back!   But I always love the new flavors the truck is crafting and would love to eventually try them all. Look for creative fillings to tempt your taste buds (and stomach) like leeks, mushrooms, southwestern chicken and whatever else they have in that rolling kitchen. As a lover of all things cheesy, I feel this is a must. And their looooong lines at Food Truck Fridays tell you something good is always being toasty. You better brie-lieve it : )",

    "text": "Ummm yeah, what an amazing concept for a food truck. These guys are seriously stupid good. Sliced bread, melted cheese with amazing ingredients added, puts another label on comfort food.  After looking over the menu with my friend, I wanted to try every sandwich they had. Unfortunately, that would be to much to take on that many sandwiches. So we decided to get two separate sandwiches and split them. We got the pastrami and the mac and cheese with the pulled pork. Both sandwiches were amazing. The mac and cheese and pulled pork was by far the best one but the pastrami was good on its own also. It is just tough to beat amazing mac and cheese, delicious pulled pork and then more cheese added to that.   Papi Queso is a great additional to our already wonderful food trucks in the QC. Check them out! You will be glad you did!",

Plus, the awesome owners surely don't hurt my love for this truck.   But what is a food truck without a great concept? This truck definitely has found theirs. Their carefully created gourmet grilled cheeses are nothing like those your mother made, but that's what makes them great. Until Papi Queso, I didn't think I could be in love with each and every bite of a savory sweet and cheesy sandwich.  The other great thing about this food truck is it's very visible. Often times, I have difficulty locating food trucks; however, this one tends to be out all the time and is ready to serve.",

I mostly stand against NC barbecue but when you put it on a grilled cheese.... well I kinda have to like it.   The truffle kettle chips were earthy, sophisticated, and delicious. The tomato bisque, though, was the star of the non-sandwich category. It's pretty awesome as far as soups go. Somewhere in the top 10 of my all-time fave list. So far.  Definitely going to have to catch up with them again.",

I have been waiting to try their food for a while now and I was not disappointed.  The guys in the truck were super friendly and very informative about their menu.  Fairly simple menu of different grilled cheeses/melts and a few sides like tomato soup, truffled kettle chips and pickles, which are all traditional sides for grilled cheese as far as I am concerned.  The leek and mushroom sandwich was calling my name.  Gruyere cheese and mushrooms, you had me at hello.  Chips were great with parmesan and rosemary flavors standing out prominently. I am usually not a big fan of pickles, but these were addictive.  Overall menu is pretty simple and I am not sure if they mix it up or not. Good variety of melts from 5-8$ and sides from 3-5$. They do have some extras to add to any melt, but I am not sure if you can build your own or if they have other options for bread.  Bottom line: I will definitely be visiting Papi Queso again whenever I get the chance.",

My boyfriend had the Pig Mac - out of this world.  I had a little bit of entree envy with that one.  We also tried the chips.    I'm docking a star for the cost- two sammies, one basket of chips (eh, based on that portion size, I imagine you would get 5 chips in the \"cup\"), and two drinks ran about $28 including tip.    Also, given that they were at the antique mall, there's not really anywhere to sit.  I'm not sure why they bother with that location?  It would be nice of they could set up a long bar table (no need for chairs) for folks to stand and enjoy their meal - afterall, strike while the grilled cheese is hot!!  We decided to \"tailgate\" but I think next time I'll hunt them down at one of the local breweries.  Business seems to be good, and looked like there was a good amount of repeat customers.",

The French onion is a classic as is the Pig Mac. I mean - mac and cheese, pulled pork and bourbon onions between two slices of bread and grilled??? Come on with that goodness!!! Although I'm not a fan of mushrooms I tried the leek & mushroom and loved it. Their menu rotates a lot so each time you go you can try something new. Be on the lookout for the Spanish chorizo and the chicken & grapes as some of their specials - you will not be disappointed!! Next on my list to try is their tomato soup!  I had seen that this truck was doing a launch party - a week after it happened!  I was devastated because well, I love cheese.  Recently while out at Salud, this truck was parked outside and I had some of the truffle potato chips and they haunt me.  They were unbelievably delicious.  I am most definitely going to find this truck and try more food of theirs.  In fact, I want to try ALL of it!!  Even the mushroom sandwich and I do not like mushrooms, but I have such faith that this sandwich will make my heart melt.  Can't wait to sample more of your yummies!!!!",

I got the cheese with applewood bacon sandwich, a hefty $7.00. They use a large, dense bread and there were 2 slices of cheese that were much smaller than the bread, leaving a pretty big crust on empty crust area. Their bacon is thick and I was able to adjust it so all the lacking space had bacon. I was impressed that they butter their WHOLE area of bread, just like I make mine at home. I didn't have any of the sides yet. I will return and see what I try next time. The people on the truck are quite friendly!",

I split a green monster and a mushroom and leek with a friend, and while they were both delicious (I liked the mushroom and leek best), I felt they were expensive for what we got -- small sandwiches on wonderbread-sized toast -- and we waited for quite a while before our orders came up.   With that being said, they were definitely delicious: crispy and crusty on the outside and melty and warm on the inside. There were interesting varieties and flavor combinations as well.
