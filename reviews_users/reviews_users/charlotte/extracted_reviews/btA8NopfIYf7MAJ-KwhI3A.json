We got the empanadas and I'd be extremely surprised if these things weren't frozen before they fried them. The chicken empanada was flavorless and had nasty texture. The beef ones weren't so bad. Still not very good though. Our main entree was terrible. It was a rice dish with a combination of chicken, shrimp, steak, oysters & squid. My first impression was the smell and it just smelled old. Seafood that is not fresh has a very district smell and taste and this dish did not smell or taste good at all. The rest of the night, even after we went home, we still smelt it and it makes me nauseated just thinking about it. I hope we just ordered wrong or just caught them on a bad night because I really wanted to enjoy this place.",

I ordered a churrasco which came with rice, beans, and sweet plantains. Hubby offered a shrimp in garlic sauce which came with rice, fries, and salad. The kids had tenders and burgers from the kids menu. I was SO disappointed that the churrasco I got was NOT the churrasco I was expecting. I'm not sure if that was my mistake because they're called differently down here or if that was their mistake for False advertising, but the cut of meat used was completely different. They also put what I think was the chimichurri sauce under the steak as opposed to on top of it which I've never seen done before. So not only was it the wrong cut of meat, but it also didn't taste as good as I would've liked. The rice, beans, and plantains were good so I'll give them that. Hubby said his shrimp could've been more garlicky but I enjoyed them. I didn't try the burger, but tried the tenders and fries and they were really good. I might come back, but it'd definitely be to try something else aside from the churrasco.",

Updated: after several attempts to have dinner we finally managed to come in when they were open. The hours on Google are not accurate and sometimes they close early. We were greeted with  plantain chips and pink sauce which was  amazing and such a nice change from chips and salsa.  The waitress was an absolute sweetheart.  There's nothing better than  service from a truly friendly  person!  We both ordered the paison (steak, sausage, pork skin, egg, corn cake, avocado, AND plantains. ) I was stoked to be able to sub the rice and beans for salad - the salad was beautiful to boot! I asked for the pink sauce for my salad - so good! The meal was absolutely delicious and perfect. Much better value than any of these chain restaurants and way more authentic. We will definitely be back!!!",

The empanadas de carne o pollo, churrascco, & the Bandeja Paisa are to die for. If you are in N.C., and love Colombian cuisine, then I highly recommend this place. Two thumbs up!!!",

    "text": "We decided to give this place a try, based on the prior highly rated reviews. Had a bad first impression so we will not be coming back. I came here to order takeout so I could take the food home to enjoy with my husband who was home with the kids. First, upon entering the restaurant, no one glanced up to greet me. Mind you, there is an open window into the kitchen that is visible to the front door. The kitchen staff was talking with the wait staff when I entered the door, so I gave them a few minutes, giving them the benefit of the doubt, saying to myself that they \"must be busy\". Still nothing. I went to grab a menu off of the wall (which was next to the window) to garner some attention. Nothing. Finally, I was able to grab the attention of a gentleman who came out of the kitchen--I asked if I could order takeout, and he answered yes, but he acted like I was wasting his time. I informed him that I was ready to order, and he was surprised. Sorry, Sir, I was there long enough to decide on which items to order. As I was ordering, he corrected me in my pronunciation of the names of the dishes, having me repeat the words in the correct accent. He finished taking my order and gave me the receipt to sign/pay, and just stood here. Granted, it was my prerogative whether or not to add a tip to the total. I will say that I am not known to give a tip if I order takeout. However, I felt pressured to do so, as he stood there and watched me sign the receipt. I did add a tip, and justified doing so (to myself) because this was a local restaurant (i.e. not a chain)/small business. He took the receipt without saying anything. I asked how long the wait would be; he answered \"about 15 minutes\". I then tried to start up a friendly conversation with him, he obliged and we spoke briefly for a couple of minutes. I then asked him what the breads were next to the front counter, as I intended to purchase some to try. He said something about bread with cheese, and proceeded to hand me a napkin. I was confused and asked \"you want me to try it?\" He nodded and I picked up a \"roll\" to eat and asked if these rolls were given out for patrons who dine in, and he answered yes. He then walked away, stating that he needed to \"go make some more\", leaving my itemized receipt on the counter, so I picked it up. I had ordered two empanadas (one chicken, one beef), one Arepa de Chocolo con queso, one Arepa con queso, one Milanesa de Pollo, one Entrana, and one order of Flan. All, including tip, cost under $50. As I was waiting for my order to be ready, I tried that roll. That roll was really good, crispy/crusty on the outside and was cheesy/doughy on the inside.  They had a couple of tables of patrons who were dining in. The lady who was waiting on the dine-in tables was also responsible for getting my order ready. She asked if I had the Milanesa, I answered yes. She proceeded to place a container in a bag and then set it down in front of me, implying that my food was ready to go. I asked her if everything was in there? She said \"you said you had the Milanesa\"....right, but I had some other items that I ordered as well. I grabbed the itemized receipt and showed her. She said \"you should've given this to me so I knew what you ordered.\" I'm sorry, what? How was I supposed to know you had nothing to go off of, other than the itemized receipt that the gentleman had left on the counter? She grabbed the rest of my order and I asked her if it was possible for me to grab another one of the \"rolls\" so I could take it home for my husband to try. She started to put one roll with a pair of tongs into a small paper bag and casually asked \"you paid for it already, right?\" Being honest, I said \"no, the gentleman let me try one and it was really good, so I was wondering if I could take one home for my husband to try as well.\" She hesitated, glanced through the window into the open kitchen, and I pointed out to her the gentleman who took my order. She said \"let me ask him, he's the owner\". I smirked but said okay. She walked up to the window and talked to him loudly across the kitchen, then grabbed a bowl of soup to take to a table. As she passed by me, she said \"he'll be right out\". At this point, I'm thinking 'All I'm asking for is one roll that you would have given me if I had dined in'. The lady walked back from delivering the bowl of soup,went into the kitchen and had a quiet conversation with the gentleman, who I now knew as the owner. She then came out and told me \"It'll be a dollar.\" Excuse me? I ordered two entrees plus 4 orders of appetizers and a dessert. She then put a roll into a bag without asking if I wanted one and told me to add $1 to the receipt I already signed. I was peeved. Besides the overpriced roll that they begrudgingly gave me, their food was bland. Portions were small and no sauce accompanied the Milanesa. The chimichurri was bitter as there was no acidity to it and wasn't fresh. Poor food and even worse service--don't waste your $ or time",

There also was a lunch menu with 6 different entrees for $5.99 each. My husband ordered off the regular menu and I had the rotisserie chicken, rice, & beans from the special $5.99 menu. Large portion's and was delicious.   The dress is casual and I noted they are open for breakfast too. We will try that for sure!",

    "text": "Because of its superb reviews, my wife and I had very high expectations on the Friday evening of our first visit. Let me state up front, that our expectations were easily met.  First and foremost, the service was warm and friendly. It was obvious that you as the customers, are greatly appreciated. The dining area was comfortable, clean and, by 7:30, packed. About half of the diners were hispanic, which says a lot in itself. We appreciated their 95 sanitary score and everything looked immaculate from the entrance to the rest rooms.  We started with chicken soup. It was savory. As cilantro lovers, we appreciated the fact that it was amply supplied. Normally we have to ask for extra.  The empanadas were fabulous. We tried both the chicken and the beef. Normally, I prefer chicken but their shredded beef was outstanding. The outer crust was a little different than what I am used to in that it was corned based instead of flour. Not sure which is more authentic but I loved their version.  My Carne Asada was thinly sliced, perfectly grilled and off-the-charts delicious. I will order again! Serving sizes of all entrees are huge.  My Cuban wife rated her Arroz con Pollo 7.5 stars as she has been spoiled by her mother's traditional recipe. Their's somewhat resembles fried rice but my uneducated, American taste buds enjoyed it. All of the sides - plantains, rice, beans, salad and dressing - were very good.   One small negative overall however is that nothing was piping hot as we prefer it. That will not prevent us from returning soon, however, it does prevent me from giving it 5 stars. Although not quite a Gotta Try, it is close. I highly recommend it!",

You'd think with a name like that they'd have a REAL coffee machine to make Cafe con Leche, Cafesito, Expresso which are available in EVERY Colombian bakery/restaurant, except this one. They have drip coffee which is blasphemous for a latin bakery/ restaurant!    Moving on to the complimentary platanitos (plantain chips)  which is also unusual for a Colombian restaurant as they would typically serve warm bread w/butter, except this restaurant.   As we placed our order I asked for frijoles rojos (red beans) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I then asked for lentejas(lentils) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I even asked the server if they were  sure they're a Colombian restaurant.    My Carne Asada Steak was extremely thin and lacking flavor, the rice was up to standard and the ONLY beans they offered were Pinto Beans which are typically available in Peruvian restaurants.   The Sirloin Steak wasn't bad and actually had some seasoning. The maduros were ripe and good, but you cannot be a REAL Colombian restaurant and not have RED BEANS or LENTILS!   They are definitely not AUTHENTIC COLOMBIANS!",

The customer service and friendliness is also 5 Star.    Make sure to get an empanada and an arepa de chocolo. The fried shrimp are butterflied and fried perfect, be sure to get the pink sauce to dip them in. Mmmm. The chimichuri  and aji are made fresh everyday.  Tres leeches is the best we've had. Paired with a fresh Colombian coffee, wow.",

I have a Colombian friend that told me this was the best Colombian place in the city and since I LOVE Colombian food I had to check it out! The service was outstanding! I have nothing bad to say about them, they were nice, attentive and fast! We ordered a guayaba juice for me that was pretty good and a limeade for my husband.  For appetizer we had beef empanadas and for entree we both went with the carne asada that originally comes with fried plantain but we asked them to switch it for fried yucca and they did it without additional charges.  Food came with at the same time the empanadas did. One of the waiters apologized and seriously it was not big deal the main problem was the ceiling fan, our food got cold within few minutes :( The food was good, we loved everything! The empanas were not my favorite today, they tasted good but the dough was too rough even though they were fried as per request. Both sauces that came with the empanadas were good, chimichurri and another one that I don't know the name, the second one was real spicy but good! Unfortunately they are too far away from us so I don't see us going back there any time soon.  I believe they are worth the try, great service and good food.",

Haven't had anything else of there menu but if the bandeja is good I'm sure the rest is too.  The chicharron is cooked crispy just how i like it.  The chorizo was outstanding. However The beings were a tad bit runny and over cooked, and it wouldn't kill the waiter to smile more. But no big deal. I highly recommend you try it!",

    "text": "Came here with my GF for the first time, was pleasantly surprised.  We love Mexican food so we figured Colombian food was probably similar.  It's different, but in a good way.  Most dishes seem to come with savory (not sweet) baked beans (not refried), white rice, and fried plantains...which is odd to me except the beans are amazing tasting and I seem to like fried plantains more than I thought. I had the plate that comes additionally with a corn cake, sausage link, fried egg, piece of flat steak, and piece of avocado.  Everything was tasty, we had some leftover chimichurri from the appetizer empanadas (best I've ever had btw).  The chimichurri went well on everything.  Anyhow, the staff was very nice and the food was awesome, but very filling.  Will be back for sure.  Definitely a nice change from La Unica which is in the same plaza.  I wish more people tired this place because something this unique deserves to stay in business.  Try it if you are on the fence.",

The food did not disappoint, the prices are very reasonable and to boot the portions were generous.  The \"bandeja paisa\" was tasty & would order again, the ONLY thing I would do differently is to request my egg to be cooked sunny side up, opposed to an over done yolk.  The beans were delicious ...as was their chicken soup, nice amount of chicken & veggies the broth was perfect!  I m not one for arepas but according to my picky Columbian father they were not bad. He also loved their morcilla, I am not one for blood anything so needless to say I past.   Dessert:  Las brevas (figs) were TDF they really were pretty special, not rich at all just sweet enough.  The Arequipe (dulce de leche) was phenomenal ...I suggest just a slight dab with each bite of a fig, that way it's a perfect balance of sweet.   Saved the BEST for LAST!  The Lolu is a MUST, do yourself a favor & don't MISS OUT on this beverage, you will NEVER encounter a more unique & rare wild fruit beverage again!!! It taste like a combo of kiwi, orange & maracuya (passion fruit). VERY refreshing (light) hence easy to drink!  I loved it SO MUCH I ordered a couple bottles via Amazon.   Buen provecho",
