The meat choices are fresh and deliciously prepared, in fact I would say on par with Morton's and Ruth's Chris at a slightly more palatable price point. The staff was very professional and everything was nicely done.  A good solid dining experience.",

The ambiance was great, it was packed for Valentines day so we took a high top table in the bar. They had a jazz band (if you want to call it that, a piano player and bass guitarist) I had the filet and my date had a ribeye. Both were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Big helping for side items. Desserts are standard fare but very well done. One of the best meals I've had in a while. Highly recommend this spot!",

Love the location, south end with a lot of good places to chose from to eat and drink. Right off the light rail which we took from downtown.   We wanted to watch March madness so we sat outside with perfect weather.  Started out with the wedge and also we ordered a kale salad.  Pretty standard for steakhouses  We got the ribeye and New York cooked perfectly medium rare with mushrooms and hash browns for sides.  Also a side of bernaise for both.  Mushrooms were amazing and the steaks had just the right amount of seasoning.   Good drinks, food, service, and atmosphere.  Can't wait to get up to Charlotte.",

    "text": "My husband and I like to try higher end steakhouses, especially for special occasions.  I had not tried this restaurant before. So he made a reservation for my birthday. I think they have a good menu and the food was very good, I got the bone in ribeye and he got the salmon. Both were well prepared. As an appetizer we did the calamari which was quite good.  That is why I am giving them 3 stars.  My issue is that the service was LACKING for what one would expect at a higher end restaurant. We knew we were going to have an issue the minute we were sat across from a party of 16 celebrating a 50 th birthday. It was a week night, the restaurant was not crowded but for some reason they sat a large party near the front along with several other parties bunched up around  that table, including ours. IMHO they should have seated a party that large away from others. The party was fairly tame but there were times when we could not hear each other because as with any group there is going to be a lot of conversation, and some will be louder than others. I fault management for seating several parties so close together around a large group while other tables near the back sat empty. Doesn't make sense and doesn't enhance the dining experience.  Our waitress was one of the people attending that table. Every time, regardless of whether the restaurant is high end or low end, when we have had a server attending a large party, we have felt shortchanged on service and that was the case here. Our service was delayed the entire meal- from removal of dishes, filling of water glasses,  serving of food. When we asked the server about the table, she flippantly stated oh it was just a group celebrating a 50 the birthday not 20 somethings, so it should not get out of hand. I thought that was an odd comment to make, and somewhat offensive. I am not sure why she had to go there. IMHO her answer should have been, don't worry I'll take good care of you or offered to move us.   My husband had advised that we were celebrating my birthday so she offered a free dessert from the menu- we did the warm chocolate cake which was good. He had planned to order coffee, but she left before he could even do so. Usually coffee is offered. She did not offer it. It felt like she was trying to wrap up us and get us out of there.  We paid the bill and when she returned his credit card, she thanked him by his first name!!  We felt that was unprofessional. Throughout the meal she had a very cavalier, casual attitude with us that I just didn't appreciate.  We chose not to make a scene in the dining area, but when we got to the hostess stand on the way out, we asked to speak to manager. A young manager came out to talk to us, apologized and offered his card with a promise of free drinks and appetizers at a future visit. I would try another steakhouse before coming back here. Restaurants need to remember that you only get one chance to make a first impression.",

The second time I went (last year, thinking the same way), I had my boyfriend dress up. Well, when we got there, people had on shorts & flip-flops! Ah well, I digress...  The steaks are yummy & the a la carte sides are delicious. I went with the caesar salad, filet mignon, creamy horseradish mashed potatoes & green beans. My bf got filet mignon, creamed spinach & the same mashed potatoes. So delightful!  The staff is very attentive, the restrooms & restaurant are clean. The bar out front is very relaxed & I love that they have jazz sometimes.  The patio is nice, as well.  Sullivan's is quite pricey, so I have to reserve it only for special occasions.",

Yes there wasn't any, nor was there high end decor or finishes for the prices they charge for a meal. Laminated bar? Really? Also they dining/bar was very loud because of a large group of college boys ordering shots. Our food was cooked perfectly but management needs to work on everything else.. I would not reccomend.",

It seems to me that if you are aware it will be a busy time the valet situation would be better planned out.  There was a pre-fixed menu for the evening was fine but for $89 per person the steak should be tasty.  My date ordered his steak medium well and it was so tough he was unable to cut it.  My creamed spinach was cold and my date's mashed potatoes were very stiff.  There was a lady going from table to table taking pictures, however she never stopped by to ask us if we wanted a photo.  Yes I am African American and I never use the race card but it was very strange that she never came to our table.  I've been to Sullivan's before but this will be my final visit.",

Conveniently located in Charlotte's South End neighborhood, Sullivan's appears to be a great spot to grab lunch, dinner, or a drink. We arrived on a Tuesday just before they officially opened for lunch (11:30). To my surprise, aside from us there was only one other party waiting to be seated. And, throughout our short 30 minute stay I didn't see anyone else come in the door. We weren't really hungry for lunch, but we each ordered a bloody Mary. I think we were both in the mood for a drink with a homemade mix, but they use the premixed commercial stuff that you can find in just about any food store. The drinks were a bit on the weaker side, so we then transitioned over to wine (which, btw, we should have ordered in the first place). We didn't order any food as we ended up dining at the 7th Street Market later in the day.  Lastly, one of the highlights of our time at Sullivan's was the extremely friendly and outgoing bartender who, just happened to also be from Pittsburgh. We enjoyed talking with her and hearing about her experiences in Charlotte.  If we move into the area, we'd likely give Sullivan's another go.",

I've frequented chain Steakhouses before; Morton's, Ruth Chris', Capital Grille, etc... and Sullivan's definitely ranks up there as one of my favorites (Capital Grille, not being one of them!).   Definitely start with the Crispy Shanghai Calamari and the Iceberg Lettuce Wedge Salad...both are amazing! The salad had a blue cheese dressing which I liked...and I do not generally like blue cheese! I had the Chili Crusted Ribeye...delicious. My fiance had the Pan Seared Sea Bass Hong Kong Style, which I liked, but she wasn't in love with. My in-laws went for the 3 course dinner for 2, and at $79, it was definitely a good deal!   A little on the pricey side, as Steakhouses can be, but a good meal with great service for the price tag.   PS: Order a Mojito...best I ever tasted.",

Where the rating starts to fall is the feeling of the place.  While the bar area seemed nice and warm and cozy.  The dining area with it's low booths and open area seating takes away from the experience in my opinion.  I want a little seclusion some times.  But all in all this place is a solid dinner choice.",

I got the martini with blue cheese olives and my boyfriend got the sweet chocolatey specialty cocktail. They were great! I did order some more olive juice for my martini because I like them extra dirty. We then got the Caesar salad and shrimp and lobster bisque. The soup was incredible. For our entrees we got the lobster and filet that came with 2 sides. We got the garlic mashed potatoes and the lobster Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was okay but the steak and lobster was incredible. So were the appetizers. For dessert we got the chocolate mousse and the cheesecake. The chocolate mousse was very rich and good. All in all a great experience. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the timing. We did have to wait about 30 minutes or so past when our reservation time was but it wasn't too bad. I just wish they would have been a little more clear about the timing. We got a text 15 mins after our reservation time saying that our table was ready and then when we told the hostess we didn't get seated until about 15 or so minutes after that so we aren't sure if they had forgotten about us or not. But turns out they hadn't forgotten and we got seated and all in all it was a great experience!",

They have many options of wines, but this was the only one by the glass. Starter: I am a lover of Seared Rare Ahi Tuna but the spicy mustard sauce was too much. Other than that, the tuna was a good option. Salad: Split the wedge. It was very crisp, and the blue cheese was very flavorful! Entree: I loved the Filet Duxelle Mushroom Stuffed 8oz steak! Very delicious and I highly recommend! Side Dishes: Ask for the Loaded Baked Potato FULLY loaded! They put the white cheddar cheese sauce on it that they use in their Mac and Cheese. This was along with the normal loaded options. Delicious! The Steakhouse Skillet Mushrooms were great too! I'm clearly a fan of mushrooms... Dessert: Go for the seasonal Peanut Butter Black Bottom Pie! Don't even hesitate on this one if you like peanut butter. Presentation was beautiful and I loved the salted peanuts, caramel, and chocolate shavings that topped this amazing dessert! Will be back!",

    "text": "My little brother had just turned 21, and as a Marine he didn't often get to enjoy delicious food so I wanted to treat him to a great steakhouse. After reading lots of Yelp reviews, I had decided on Sullivan's Steakhouse.  To reduce the wait, I originally made a reservation earlier in the week for 730, but when I tried to change it online it said that my reservation wasn't found. When I called, they acted like I wanted a new reservation, so to move on I just created a new one for 8 pm. We had a couple beers at Sycamore earlier in the night, so we walked over to Sullivan's and got there right at 8 pm. We were really hungry, but were told that they were running behind and it should only be about 15/20 minutes, we weren't pleased, but it was a nice night so we waited outside. At about 8:25, I went inside to check in again and they said that they were still waiting on tables.... then at 8:50, we were finally seated. I understand that sometimes the tables are running behind, but I definitely did not make a reservation to be seated almost an hour later. It would be great if they would have texted us that they were running late so that we could have stayed at Sycamore.   To counter this, the service from our waiter was spectacular. We got a free appetizer for our wait (no I didn't ask) and when we ordered the crab cakes the waiter gave us advice that with out 4 people, it might make more sense to get another appetizer. We definitely appreciated that advice!  We ordered 2 bottles of wine along with dinner, and ordered steaks along with some sides served tableside. I got the filet mignon, and it was perfectly cooked, buttery and melt in your mouth. I also got the Cajun butter, which is butter that has Cajun spices that you can put on your steak (which then melts.) I liked how they didn't automatically add it so you were able to control how much butter is on your steak. We got the mushrooms, asparagus, king crab gnocchi and garlic horseradish mashed potatoes. My favorite was definitely the king crab gnocchi- spicy and creamy, with chunks of jalapenos.  You probably only need about a side per person maximum, as they are large in conjunction with the steak. We were pretty full, but the waiter approached us and said that we could get any desert, on the house to celebrate my brother's birthday. I know that he was really excited and they even added a Happy Birthday message! He got the Peanut Butter Pie, and it was rich, fluffy, with thinly sliced chocolate pieces on top and a chocolate black bottom.  We spent about $400 for 4 people, including 2 bottles of wine. We did get the appetizer and a desert for free, but overall I think it is expensive but reasonably priced based on the quality of the food and the service. I was disappointed with how they handled the reservation, but everything other than that was incredible.",

I came on a Wednesday around 6PM and the place was already packed! They have complimentary Valet parking that work off of just tips which eases the pain of trying to find parking in this busy spot. Luckily we were seated right away by the very welcoming hostesses who actually made you feel like they wanted you to have a great experience - which is a rarity.   Come here on a Wednesday. Drinks that are normally $11-$14 are discounted at $7 which is great way to save a few bucks and still feel fancy. Confirm with hostesses on the timing for that happy hour, it may be from only 5PM-630PM.   I ordered the Filet stuffed with Mushrooms and it was like butter. The mash potatoes and mac and cheese sides were worthy of licking off the plate. I certainly left feeling satisfied on a full belly of delicious dirty martinis (with blue cheese stuffed olives -- yum!) steak, and sides. Highly recommend for a fine dining experience!",

There are tables tucked around the corners, which give you some intimacy if you can snag one.  It's hard to order a drink if you aren't sitting directly at the bar.  They should have a server come around and take orders when there are a lot of people standing in the bar area.  (can you say lost revenue?)  The event was in a private room in the back, which has another patio-type room at the other end, so longer and narrow.  They packed in an amazing amount of pretty people, music and fun for the evening.  They were serving a Knockout Cocktail, which was pineapple and delicious.  Apps were a big hit... cheesesteak egg rolls (oh, so good), bruschetta and shrimp cocktail.    The staff were a bit overwhelmed by the crowd, but stayed very focused and handled everyone pleasantly.  I would say one minus is when you come blasting out of this high-energy event you are tromping right through the middle of the dining room... I felt bad for the diners who were startled by the sudden interruption of their quiet meals. oops.  Overall, with the staff and the quality of refreshments, I'd try Sullivan's again, but this time for dinner!",

    "text": "Well after many attempts to try this well known establishment we finally made it. Not to shabby but do have some complaints. At first, service was impeccable. But then, we were left for long periods of time and I had to go without coffee a couple of times and had to resort to the ice water to wash my food down messing up the flavor ratio that I was enjoying with the coffee. Anywho, we went during restaurant week and did order from that menu. We both had the same thing which was the iceberg lettuce wedge with the homemade blue cheese dressing for what was considered the first course and then the 8 oz filet with the horseradish mashed potatoes and sauteed  green beans for the second course and finally the bananas foster bread pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream. The wedge was o.k. as the homemade blue cheese dressing wasn't any better than what I could make at home. Hence \"Homemade\" I assume. The filets we order well-done and have had disastrous results at other places but there have been a few that actually know how to cook a well-done steak and not let it become dry and disgusting. This wasn't one of those places, or at least not when we went. We found that the cook had gashed opened our filets to see if they were in fact well-done and anyone who knows anything about cooking steak will agree that the last thing one should do is cut into a freshly cooked steak as it will lose most of the juices. This is exactly what occurred here. What a shame too. The sauteed green beans where very crunchy and could have stayed in the pan a bit longer. The mashed potatoes were more than likely the best thing about the whole meal. I really cannot think of a thing wrong with them other than there could have been more of them. They were very good. And last but not least, The bread pudding. I wouldn't order this again as it came out room temp. and the first bite had me at \"a little stale\". It could, and should, have been much better. Especially for the type of place this is supposed to be. What time the waitress did spend with us, she was warm and welcoming plus very helpful in answering all our questions. We will have to come and give them another chance after all the fuss and muss of this restaurant week passes. Maybe when it is a time that they are not offering specials so we can see if there is a difference in the regular menu food and service as opposed to the price you pay for the specials. Is it one of those times when you get what you pay for?",

    "text": "This place was superb in all respects: food, presentation, service, ambiance.  It really left nothing to be desired in a five-star steakhouse experience.  And the fact that the Chicago Bears picked up the tab made it all the sweeter. ;)  Our party of eight ordered the oysters Rockefeller, seared ahi tuna tartare, fried calamari, and seafood sampler appetizers.  I tried all but the last, and all were adequate-to-amazing.  The oysters Rockefeller were goeey-cheesy, spinachy and warm, with just the slightest tinge of salty oyster flavor beneath.  The ahi tuna tartare was fresh, perfectly seared and presented beautifully.  Even the standard calamari was above-average: warm and soft, not rubbery in the slightest.  My wedge salad with diced roma tomatoes, fresh-ground black pepper and creamy bleu cheese dressing was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The lobster bisque, presented with a zig-zag of cream down the middle, was a tad salty for my tastes.  But it did boast more than the usual amount of lobster chunks.  I've had better, but this was still good.  For my entree, I enjoyed the 12-ounce filet mignon with gorgonzola butter melted over it.  My date had the jumbo scallops with spicy Thai sauce.  Both were dazzling.  My steak was lean, immensely flavorful and perfectly prepared (warm and pink throughout, with no raw parts in the middle).  Our party ordered family-style sides: creamed spinach, asparagus with Hollandaise, horseradish mashed potatoes and au gratin potatoes.  I didn't try the spinach, but the rest were terrific.  And plentiful: nobody was left wanting for any of them.  For dessert, I enjoyed the bananas Foster bread pudding.  I'm normally not a bread pudding kinda guy, but it stood out on the dessert menu, so I gave it a shot.  I was not disappointed: hot, smooth, firm, with the perfect amount of banana, real whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream.  The cappucino served with dessert was lukewarm, but the service staff came around and topped it off with fresh hot coffee.  Speaking of the service staff, they could not have been more attentive to all of the various mundane tasks that often get overlooked: refilling water glasses, whisking away finished plates, scooping up crumbs with those nifty crumb-scooper-upper thingies.  Our server's knowledge of the menu and specials was thorough, and he was beyond helpful and attentive.  I don't anticipate being in Charlotte again, but if I ever am, I will flock back to Sullivan's.  Please give it a try!",

    "text": "This is probably close to being, if not my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The decor sort of has that art deco, 1930's feel to it. I have dined here three or four times and also stopped in for dessert and a drink. Thursday night they usually have a jazz band. They also have a decent, very affordable bar/late night menu. For dinner I have had their steak, crab legs and sea bass which have all been excellent. We weren't able to get in anywhere around here (Lake Norman area) for restaurant week last year at the last minute so we made reservations for Sullivan's and drove right down. I also enjoyed their chocolate covered strawberries at the bar around Valentine's Day. As far as drinks go they make great martini's and have a decent wine selection.",

Two minor flaws kept me from giving a 5 star rating: Too much peppery seasoning on the NY Strip, which was of excellent quality and could have stood on its own - and the failure of the bartender to mention the $5 martini specials when as asked about them. (We found out during our meal from our waiter) All things considered, a great experience, and we will be back!",

We love jazz and this is the best place in Charlotte we have found to check it out, even better than Blue.  We like that we can go eat formal in the main dining area or take advantage of the happy hour and bar menu hanging out listening to jazz all night.  We have been there 6 times in 2011 and plan to go at least 1 Saturday per month moving fwd.  Considering it is close to an hour from our house, you can tell that we enjoy going to Sullivan's.  Service is great.  Jazz is great.  The food is an 8 out of 10.  Fairly pricey and you get more or less what you would expect.  We take friends with us about 50% of the time and they have all loved going and talk about it afterwards.",

We could not have been happier with how it all turned out. Natasha was such a pleasure to work with - her attention to detail, professionalism and helpfulness went above and beyond. She made sure everything was perfect for our event, right down to helping us decorate the private room (which took almost 4 hrs. but looked beautiful when finished!) and attending to our every need. Our three servers, (Spencer, Evan and Amy) were excellent and the food was delicious. All of our guests had a wonderful time and the evening was a huge success! I would highly recommend Sullivan's for your next special event and cannot say enough about their event planner Natasha Demaio and the expert care she took to help ensure our guests had a wonderful evening and our very special dinner was a perfect event!",

I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal or service experience here. Of the upscale steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Beef and Bottle, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Palm, etc), Sullivan's may not rate as the best in each category (food, service, value, atmosphere), but I would put it 2 or 3 in each one - thus giving it the title of Charlotte's best steakhouse.",

We have eaten here a dozen times and service is hit or miss.  Went in their twice and got rare cowboy steak when I asked for medium.  I know it's hard to cook, but...The second time it happened they brought it out three times. The first time it was raw with barely any marks, the second time it was medium rare, then they left it on till it was black and the manager came out with it and tried to convince me it was medium.  No apologies, no fresh steak, no free desert.  I did not eat it or send it back and no one cared.  At those prices I was fed up.  My husband an I tried to give it another shot recently after seeing a movie.  We went in to get drinks and a dessert.  The kitchen was closed a few minutes before we sat down.  We asked if we could get a cold desert, peice of bread, or a pretzel?  Nothing, just drinks.  After one with out food, we were done.  Sad to say Sullie's is comin' off the list.  :(",

I had a mushroom duxelle filet with creamed spinach and white cheddar au gratin potatoes.  My steak was cooked perfectly and it had a goat cheese butter melted over the top that was to die for.  The steak really was delicious, but that sauce could have been served over an old sneaker and made it taste good.  The side dish portions are HUGE and definitely shar-able.  The table had oysters rockefeller, crab cakes, and calamari for appetizers and there was plenty to go around for all of us (table of 9).  The calamari are some of the best I have ever eaten.  They are gigantic, not rubbery at all, and have that fresh seafood melt-in-your-mouth quality.  The piece de resistance for me, however, was their signature Knockout martini.  They infuse chunks of pineapple in orange vodka for over a week and then crush it up, put it over ice, and strain the concoction into a martini glass.  Yowza....it is awesome!  Definitely pricey, but well worth it.  Good, solid food and our service was top-notch.",

I decided to take a few friends with me this time and I was quite disappointed. I had the 12oz Filet Mignon, prepared medium rare, closer to the rare side. When it arrived I was upset when I cut into a medium cooked piece of meat. I brought it to our waitresses attention (who was very pleasant throughout our visit) and she took it back to be corrected right away. The weight wasn't long before the manager arrived with a new cut that was suppose to be prepared correctly this go around. Once again I was disappointed when I cut into another improperly prepared steak. I was too frustrated at the time to address it again, plus my company was already half way through their own meals. I enjoyed all other aspects of my meal except the steak and cheesecake. It's unfortunate that such a high quality restaurant can be so inconsistent with its food. Will give them one last shot, a best two out of three hopefully.",

The salad was drowned in dressing, but that can be prevented in the future by ordering it on the side.  The only negative thing I have to say about the steak is that they wanted me to order all kinds of crap to put on top of it.  A good, proper steak only needs to be served with a side of au jus!  The meat was properly cooked, and I ate the whole thing.  On Sunday nights, the drink menu is half price, so I had 2 froofy martinis.  They were pretty good too.  Our server was very nice as well, and did her job well.  This place is also fairly gluten-free friendly, but as with any place, you have to remind the staff over and over that no, you can't have the bread and butter that they placed in front of you, and that is a bit irritating.",

Much to my dismay, the gentleman working the counter picked up a spoon, looked at it, then used his finger and thumb to wipe it off. Then he put it into a bowl of broccoli. The next incident was even worse. This same man had been wiping the edges of the plates ready to be served.  He DROPPED the cloth on the floor, picked it up, and continued wiping.  I discussed this with the manager and he replaced that man. The new man wore gloves and everything appeared alright. But it disturbs me that it happened at all.",

I ordered the filet; it was well past the medium I requested and, to my taste, everything seemed extremely salty, including the horseradish mashed potatoes and the mushroom caps. The server was quite attentive, almost a little too much so; it was hard to carry on a conversation. But I guess that's quibbling and better than having to hunt down your server.

The steaks were great!  I got the filet, and the BF got the NY strip.  I think we both agreed that my steak was tastier, since it was so tender. I agree with the previous reviewer that they put a lot of pepper on the steaks, but I really thought it added to the flavor.  He got horseradish mashed potatoes on the side, which I thought were delicious.  I got a baked potato, which they dress for you table-side.  All the steaks are served with a wedge salad with blue cheese.  It was very tasty, although I thought it would be better with bacon -- perhaps you should ask for that on the side, if you go.  After dinner, we had Irish coffees.  Not on the dessert menu, but they were happy to oblige.  So, bottom line, how do I feel about this place?  OK, so a couple of things that I wasn't too jazzed about, and I felt like this impacted my general opinion about the restaurant service:  1) Our waitress was very nice, but scarce.  Wouldn't have been that big of a deal, except for....  2) My potato was not hot.  I know, I know, I'm being high-maintenance, right? But I don't think so.  I've decided to come here, pay for a $35 steak.  The least you can do is bring me a potato that's not ROOM TEMPERATURE.  Seriously.  I want to eat my $7 baked potato with the rest of my meal.  I had to wait a while before I could track her down.  Overall, the meal was good.  The ambiance is nice.  Steak is good.  I'd recommend going here -- just don't order the baked potato!",

I almost left as I drove round the whole parking building three times with no spot.  Ending up I had to use their valet.  Perhaps, this is to create jobs,  Tell our forecoming President.  I may be picky (you may say)  I'm half Jewish and I only do not eat pork or shell fish, besides due to my job, I see lobster and good food everyday, I did not have many choices of appetizer.  I picked steak tartar whatever but I did not like the taste as there was only meat taste.  I saw my friend order oyster that looked good.  We shared a porter house steak but he did not order any side.  (He was to pay and this was the first time eating out with him, I was observing.)  The meat was cooked to our choice - good.  For the others, wait till I go out with another friend and try again.  I see that the menu does have good items.  Good try.  The price???  Mummmm depending with where you want to compare. Feel like eating at Sheraton or Marriott Hotel.   It is pricey.  In California, you can get better price for this standard. But definitely, a place that you can show off a little bit if you are dating someone.  Haha!!  Overall, a place of class except the parking.  BTW, someone say casual dress, fortunately I always dress proper to any dinner.  Otherwise, I will be very embarrassed.  Perhaps the night I went there had lots of either company party or business people.  Sorry, am I too sarcastic???",

It was my first experience with the lettuce wedge with diced tomatoes, blue cheese dressing, and crushed black pepper - just plain awesome. Their are known for their steaks which are tremendous. Big fan of the key lime pie for dessert. The wait staff is attentive and personal. If you are visiting/living in Charlotte give it a try, you will be glad you did.",

I have to say the really do give you your $30 worth of food, unlike some other steak houses with the similar promotion.  I had the Cesar salad which was just what a Cesar salad should be. For the main course of coarse I had the fillet, that was cooked to perfection, dessert was the banana's foster bread pudding (worth going back for just that),  Our Waitress was wonderful. All the girls ordered a glass of wine and they were out of two of the options. The waitress came back with similar wines and charged the same price for the glasses. She also told them if they wanted something different to ask. This was a great move on her part, no one was without a drink the whole meal!  Overall great place, not sure about the regular prices, but $30 was perfect for me!",

We also ordered a side of sweet potato casserole. Our experience: the atmosphere was very nice and friendly even on a busy Wednesday night for restaurant week. No issues with service. Ceasar salad was good but did not care to much for the shrimp and lobster bisque. I did not like the color or care to much for the flavor. The soup was just okay but would not get it again. Our steaks were prepared and cooked to perfection! The mashed potatoes were prepared with a horse radish which none of us cared for. I finished mine but my wife and daughter did not. The big hit was the side of sweet potato casserole which pretty much could be considered a dessert because it was so sweet and delicious. Desert was chocolate mousse. We compared the mousse to Mortons downtown where we dined on Monday. Both Mortons and Sullivan's mousse were delicious but my wife and daughter preffered Sullivan's and I picked Mortons mousse as the winner. I thought Mortons was richer and had more flavor. We will definitely go back and reccomend Sullivan's.",

    "text": "After many delicious meals at Sullivan's sister restaurant Del Frisco's we were super excited to kick off restaurant week to compare the two. Sadly the experience at Sullivans was below expectations the entire night.   We showed up on time for a 7:00pm reservation and were told they overbooked and we would have to wait. We headed to the bar where I had to flag someone down for a wine list. When our table was ready (not a huge wait thankfully) we were escorted to our small table packed in the middle of two rows of booths. Being able to hear conversations quite clearly all around us did not provide the atmosphere of \"nice steak dinner\".   The Caesar salad that we both got was large, and had too much dressing for my taste, and the croutons were chewy like they weren't cooked long enough. My filet medallions were cooked as ordered but the steak lacked anything to recommend it. The horseradish potatoes had a very strong flavor that overpowered the steak. The end of the meal was the best part - my chocolate mousse was delicious but the boyfriend said his cheesecake was lackluster.    Even with the special restaurant week pricing the meal wasn't well priced enough for the quality of food we ordered. The restaurant was dimly lit and felt completely packed. I know that restaurant week, especially on the weekend, is a busy time for a restaurant but if the food and atmosphere are so uninspiring on a discount why would anyone return to pay full price?",

The service was way under par , the table was left unattended for way to long, the food came out cold, wrong orders, sent back a plate of seafood that was toxic , from start to finish it was really bad.  The understaffing on Christmas was a huge error. Definitely will not be back - this was a an embarrassment to have my guests and I experience such a disaster. Walking in we should have known when we had several open seats at the bar and waited a good 15-20 min for a \"hello may I serve you a cocktail?\" It was wayyyy different than the old Sullivans we knew and loved - we will not be back anytime soon .",

    "text": "I had booked on OpenTable and when I arrived on time, we were immediately seated to a table even though there were others waiting near the hostess stand. Awesome.  Looking over the menu, I had made my decision from the rather expensive listing of steaks and side dishes. That changed when our waiter - Matt, who was awesome - went over the evening's specials. Suddenly, the idea of a trio of small filet mignons was what I wanted and each with a different topping/sauce. Massive wine list but only a small list of beers and an even smaller list of local beers. In fact, just one. OMB Copper.   All three of us started with the wedge salads. These were good portions with plenty of blue cheese to go with the lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Not a bad deal for $4!  When they arrived, the steaks looked perfect. Three small filets, each in a different sauce. The first two, a bearnaise and an Oscar, I enjoyed thoroughly. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of sauce on top. But by the time I had cut into the third one, it was no longer quite so perfect. More overdone than I ordered and a bit of a tougher cut, especially since the first two were so good. Bummer.  For dessert, I let Matt talk me into the bread pudding. It was... fair. Just not that great with not enough taste and some of the topping was over done. I wouldn't have this again.  On the pros list, no wait for a seat when we had a reservation, excellent service from Matt, a local beer choice, great salad, and great steaks.  On the cons list, the booth was a bit too tight for the three of us to sit comfortably. Perhaps another inch or two, please? Only one choice for a local beer. Most of the steaks were great and the dessert was only fair.  Complimentary valet parking is nice, as there is not much street parking nearby.  Sullivan's is a higher-end steak joint and works hard to earn that high dollar menu.",

When he asked what brought us here, we said we were visiting from out of town and heard good things. He went completely out of his way to make the meal special for us - he brought me a rose (although he claimed my man gave it to him to give to me;)), was super friendly and checked in on us throughout the meal, and gave us a free dessert to take home with us. He was literally the best and I can see why they put new servers with him! Secondly, the food - OMG. Amazing. Steaks are the best we ever had in our life! Try the New York strip with the bourbon peppercorn sauce - it was actually my date's food but I kept stealing bites! My filet was wonderful as well. The mashed potatoes were delicious and even the bread they give you as you sit is tasty too! And you must try the calamari as an appetizer! Chris recommended it to us and it was the yummiest calamari I've ever eaten. Honestly everything at Sullivan's is the best I've ever eaten. We live four hours away but we agreed we're making special trips to Charlotte for this steakhouse. We love Sullivan's!",

I mean I love to splurge a little on having a fine dining experience accompanied with a fine steak and glass of wine. The service wasn't bad if it was Carrabas prices. We walk in and immediately are greeted by three women chilling around the hostess stand talking, one of them then helps out and gets us seated. After being seated I look at the menu and am like ok, wow this seems like a high end steakhouse. AWESOME! I get giddy seeing the different types of steaks they have. We order aps, we get their egg rolls, not bad, but not great. Then we get our salads, lol guys, I've never had a ceasar salad where they don't chop the salad for you. Maybe it's classy now to be nibbling on 8in pieces of romaine, not sure so I could be wrong on this part of what's classy now. As we were eating our aps though, the table next to us had the manager come over and were venting to him for a good 10 min on the service. I couldn't make out what was going on as it was too loud but for sure they were not happy. Anyway I order the top steak they have which was $70 wagyu- medium rare, and my wife gets the filet mignon -medium. They bring it out and me and my wife take a couple bites, look at each other and are just like, this steak sucks. It took 5 minutes to chew and was not tender at all. Cooked like we said but just terrible meat, not sure if they froze it? Or they just gave us some sams club steak they got on discount and said it was wagyu or filet mignon.  I WAS PISSED. And just wanted to get out of there asap. My whole thing is that I paid a ton of money for crappy service and worse food. From sitting down to ordering ur food, and eating everything, we were in and out of there in 30 minutes.... I've eaten at Chick-fil-A longer than that. I want the experience, the waiters to actually know their stuff and educate me in the food THEY serve, instead of me asking multiple questions about the $70 steak I'm about to order that the waiter doesn't know much about. I want to be able to sit and enjoy a nice meal with my wife instead of being interrupted every 2 minutes with the waiter asking if we decided on something or them bringing out food. I've never complained about fast service, but when you're a fine dining restaurant I feel that you have to be aware to not rush your customers. And finally, all these other issues would have melted away if I had just received a mouth watering steak that melted in my mouth. No, instead my wife and I were chewing rubber, and utterly disappointed. I had outback steak last week that tasted better than that. Again, either you drop your prices to reflect your service and food, or pick your game up. Will never go to Sullivan's again, I felt violated after being screwed over in that place.",

Great for when it is cool, but a little too warm when it is 80 out.  The service was excellent. I had the seared ahi tuna and everyone else's food at our table looked amazing (Filet Mignon, Steakhouse Salad and Chicken Kale Salad).  I have a salt sensitivity so they worked with me with limited cajun spice and the sauce on the side.  We were all so very happy that we even got dessert.  Those desserts were to die for. The sales and event planner, Nichole Daniels, even came by our table to give us all a little gift for celebrating at Sullivan's.    I have only been here one other time and it was a little disappointing. I thought I would not come back, this visit has changed my mind and I am planning on bringing my husband for a date night soon.",

The hostesses could act a little more interested.  Everything we had was excellent...  Shrimp Cocktail - excellent, huge, cocktail sauce so delish.  Caesar Salad - fresh, crisp, very tasty dressing but not overpowering.  Bread - warm, fresh, had to fight over last piece  Wine - excellent selection. I am not a connoisseur by any stretch but its a great offering.  Steak - of course, the steak... cooked to perfection and oh so amazing.  I ordered the filet.  Wow!  I skipped dessert.  Who has room after all the other stuff!  I did have a coffee.  It was well brewed, served hot.  About a week after my visit, I received a thank you card in the mail from our server and she remembered a couple of things about our conversation - like my recent visit to Switzerland.  A few days after that, I got a thank you card from one of the managers.  What a nice touch.",

There were a few other patrons in the restaurant.  The bartender was friendly enough, but not overly engaging.  But it was clear that the servers did not have their collective act together today.  Here are a few examples:  1.  Although sitting at the bar, the food always came in on the side with someone literally scaring me the first time they presented food at the table. 2.  The bartender, from approximately ten or so feet away, called at me \"do you want bread and butter?\" 3.  The phone must have rang ten times before anyone answered it even though there was someone at the door (where the phone was located) who welcomed persons in. 4.  Even though I saw a bunch of other servers and the place was not really very busy, the bartender was serving and busing other tables instead of taking care of customers at the bar.  Don't get me wrong...everyone was friendly, but the service was below what you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber, and with fairly high prices.  The food itself was good.  I had a Caesar salad, salmon and mashed potatoes.  Portions were adequate, but not overwhelming in size.  But it all tasted quite good and I felt I got my money's worth.  My \"go-to\" high caliber, high-price steakhouse in Charlotte continues to be Capital Grille.  Sullivan's could learn a lesson or two from them.",

I'm sorry I don't have the waitress' name, but she was a blonde young lady who took perfect care of us, attending to our needs, but letting us enjoy our dinner in privacy too. We all used the Sure Thing menu and had the seafood bisque (the real deal with chunks of seafood you can see and taste), filet mignon, complete with mashed potatoes, Italian bread and creamy butter, and a choice of dessert ( cheese cake, key lime pie or banana pudding). All this for $44 a person. It was outstanding! Thank you Suliivans! And thank you to the new manager from Indianapolis who was on the job one day but still greeted all the customers!",

    "text": "Previously, I have only been to Sullivan's to hang out in the cocktail area & order from the bar menu, but this review is for dinner in the dining room.    Now, generally, when I get to pick the place, my first choice would NOT be a chain restuarant, even an upscale one.  But, as it turns out, we had a gift card that could be used at either Del Frisco's or Sullivans. So, I went online to research menus ahead of time. Based on the menu (specifically the Ahi Tuna steak entree) I decided that we should go to Sullivans.      Needless to say, I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED to learn that they were out of Ahi tuna since that was the whole reason I decided to opt for Sullivans.  BUMMER!!  (I could see a smaller locally owned place running out of a popular menu item, but a huge corporate chain like Sullivans should have a better idea from their POS system about how much of certain items to keep on hand in the restarurant at any given time.)  So, I purused the menu to explore my options...sadly for those who don't eat steak (like me), the rest of the seafood or poultry options were not really exciting.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  But, as a small consolation prize, they had the Knockout martini on special for $6 (which normally is around $12)... so I started with that.  The knockout is made of clementine vodka that has fresh pineapple steeping in it for at least a week.   It was somewhat sweet, but not cloyingly so. I enjoyed it very much. 4.5 stars.   I decided to opt for one of the Sunday Prime-time specials.  For $34 a person, you can select one item from each of the following categories (however, beware, they have fairly limited options in each category):  (1.) Salad or soup,  (2.) An entree, (3.) A side dish, and  (4.) Dessert.  To go with my entree, I ordered with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  For $8, I got a fairly generous pour of an ok wine. 3 stars.   I started with the wedge salad.  3.5 stars.  The salad was huge and slathered with lots of bleu cheese dressing and a little finely chopped tomato. (At least they aren't one of those restaraurants that feels compelled to automatically throw bacon on everything.  I was glad this salad comes without.)  For my entree, I went with the salmon w/buerre blanc sauce.  The salmon was a decent size and thankfully was not overcooked. The sauce wouldn't have been my first choice if there were other options, but it tasted fine.  Overall, I would give this item 4 stars.   The side dishes on the special menu are very limited, and unfortuantely didn't include asparagus.  So, I went with the only other green option, the creamed spinach.  This dish was loaded with parmesan cheese and cream. It was ok, but I couldn't eat much of it because it was way too rich. 3 stars.   The dessert was fairly disappointing from my standpoint.  I love a good bread pudding, so I was excited about trying the Bannas Foster bread pudding.  This was made in individual ramekins and had a couple of slices of bananas in it.  It was also topped with ice cream, whip cream, and a drizzle of what looked like a carmel sauce.  Sadly, it was not very flavorful and the bread pudding had almost a rubbery texture. 2 stars.    David also got the wedge salad and chose the filet mignon for his entree.  He said the steak was over-salted.  He also chose mushrooms for his side and I tasted them - they were also a little over-salted. I couldn't eat more than a couple of these. For his dessert, he got the cheesecake to take home, since our server told us that we might want to split one dessert in house and take the other one to go (this  was a good suggestion because otherwise, it would be way too much!)  He also ordered a Highland Oatmeal Porter to go with his steak.   Our server was nice, but the service was only ok - not great. One small thing we noticed is that some tables had bread served to them and some (like ours) did not.  Since this was my first time eating in the dining room at Sullivans, I don't know if you were supposed to order the bread, or if the server just forgot to bring it.  (Not a huge deal, but it would have been a nice touch.)   Another small thing I noticed was no manager going around the dining room to greet patrons.   Overall, I was just not impressed given that our total bill came to $94 before tip.     I would come back here to meet friends for cocktails & casual bites from the bar menu, but I would not come back for a full-fledged dinner.  There are just too many other great restaurants in Charlotte to choose from at this price point.",

Great potential, some winning dishes, but overall not worth the money they demand.",

Of course, we thought it would be most befitting to have family and friends join us for his college graduation celebration dinner at our beloved Sullivan's.  We (party of 6) sat in the outside bar/patio area. Our server Marissa greeted us and introduced herself. Orders were placed, etc... the appetizers FINALLY arrived, however we did not receive any eating utensils. Upon request a few were provided, but not enough to accommodate all at the table. One of our guests had to go and ask for their own utensils, which never arrived, the table just shared what we were provided.  After over an hour wait, we inquired about the entrees, in which a different waitress was sent over, to advise us that Marissa was new, and this was not the initial incident of customers complaining, meanwhile, we consistently saw Marissa pass our table, and delightfully served the surrounding tables. We also noticed the manager speak with an adjacent table, however he failed to address our concerns, only the replacement waitress. After over an hour wait, our entrees arrived. Those of us that ordered the sure thing menu option, did not receive our soup/salads, and some entrees were incorrect all together. Sullivan's was a total disappointment and embarrassment to my boyfriend and I, as we had raved about the restaurant, and it was HIS celebratory moment that was ruined. We have frequented this location and well as the Raleigh, NC location (we' meet former Charlotte Manager, Aileen, who is currently the Raleigh, NC manager) on many occasions, and have never had to succumb to this level of poor and disappointing customer service.  Our party left dissatisfied and without most of their meals (salad, desserts).",

    "text": "My review is only for the bar area. We did not eat in the restaurant.  Went here to listen to the jazz quartet and have dessert after a day out.  Dessert (I had the cheesecake, my companion had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream) was really good.  We had coffee and water to wash our sweets down.  Our waitresses (we somehow ended up with two) were great. They both checked on us often enough and kept our drinks refilled as necessary.  We wanted to sit where we could see AND hear the musicians so we sat near the bar at a tall table, close to the patio area.  Great seats except that a slight smell of smoke wafted in continuously during our visit.   The quartet was fantastic. Great classic jazz, uptempo as well as laid back sounds.   I think they're in the wrong time slot as well as a bad location in the venue. They are set up in a back corner area of the bar area, where I assume seating was removed. It does appear the only location for them to set up comfortably.  However, because there are tv's in the bar and most of the seating in the area has patrons' backs toward the musicians, it doesn't seem likely that the quartet is getting enough visual or audio notice from the crowd.  The majority of the folk I observed in the time we were there (until 10 p.m., the same time the live music ends), seemed to be mid-30s. The folk who might enjoy the music seemed to gravitate toward the bar area around the time the group was packing up to leave.  Shame.  As a previous reviewer noted, the attire of the ladies working at the location is a bit short and tight (and the fishnets give them an air of \"Las Vegas showgirl\", in my mind) but it all fits the pseudo-upscale vibe I got from the place overall.  I don't usually frequent the south end area but if I'm in the area on a night the musicians are there, I'll drop in for dessert again.",

    "text": "Yesterday my husband and I went to Sullivan's to celebrate my birthday. He decided to take me there to try someplace we haven't been. We are regular \"steakhouse \" eaters at various known venues. What I noticed immediately is that the ambiance was wonderful and clearly it is a well visited place by many. I liked that we were seated in the back, a very private area where you could have a conversation. The service was impeccable and it was clear our waiter knew what he was talking about regarding wine pairing and preparation of a steak. My issue was the food. I was truly disappointed on many levels.  We moved to Charlotte from PA and we've noticed it is very difficult to get a Pittsburgh style medium rare steak. My husband had to send his steak back for another try. All of my food was way too salty. Whom ever ran the kitchen this evening was heavy handed with the salt to the point that I did not enjoy my dinner. My shrimp/lobster bisque, too much salt. The shaved Brussel sprouts. Too salty, The Chil encrusted rib eye, way too salty. What I enjoyed about my dinner were the mushrooms, just right and the Sullivan's reserve Cabernet.  Oh the key lime pie was tastey. The over abundance of salt not only took away the natural flavors of the food( that you missed) but would give a healthy person high blood pressure. One of the evening managers did come to the table and was sincere in his disappointment. We most likely because of this experience will not return to Sullivan's because there are other steakhouses that have consistent outcomes.",

She could not operate a wine opener and had to ask another server for help. She then forgot to order a dinner for two of us and we ate in shifts. We had to ask for hot sides for the two waiting since the other two had finished. To the credit of management they did comp a bottle of wine. I would have happily paid for it for a different experience. At the end of the day there are some of the best Steakhouse's in Charlotte. The competition of stiff. Sullivan's needs to step up their game and training program for wait staff. She wasn't ready.",

    "text": "Sullivan's has always been on my list for \"must go to\" restaurants/steak houses; they certainly didn't disappoint. its located in the South End of Charlotte and offer complimentary valet but honestly if the weather isn't bad, save yourself the wait and tight space and just park a block over, adjacent from the restaurant and simply walk over.  I took advantage of Queens Feast/ restaurant week. They were behind on reservations (the only reason why they didn't get 5 stars) I think we were seated maybe 15-20mins after our scheduled reservation.  for a starter the lovely waitress recommended the seafood sampler... which by the way was bonkers (Crab legs & claws/ Colossal shrimp/ Fresh oysters/ Lobster tails). its fairly pricey though ($60 smh)  The first course consisted of the Shrimp & Lobster bisque which was good. nothing mind blowing. For the main entree however, I go the 8oz. Hand-Cut Filet Mignon with  horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus. I can honestly say that was one of the most delectable steaks I've ever had; it was cooked EXACTLY how I asked for it (medium) and you could literally cut it with a butter knife (I know because I tried and succeeded with little to no effort). I also added the signature Cajun butter on my steak with even more so enhanced the flavor that was already there. for dessert was both the New York Style Cheesecake (amazing w/ fresh strawberries) and the best Bananas Foster Bread Pudding I've ever had with Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel sauce on the side. My date was literally trying to stab me with her fork because I kept attempting to steal a bite LOL.",

I cannot believe anyone wants to listen to that 'sound'.   And then April...oh my heavens...the WORST server on the planet. Seriously. We had a horrid experience after a positive prior experience, reported to the manager about it and from that point forward, she was a nightmare for us anytime she worked and we were there. We started doing dining room only because she made the time in the patio or bar so uncomfortable.   Natasha is an AMAZING server--always ask for her!  Mike and Mary are FABULOUS managers who rotate through the restaurant and make sure things are great...but oh that April...she's a pill and frankly, the reason we have not returned in 2016. Which saddens me because it's otherwise wonderful, but having the stink eye anytime she's there is a big negative for us.   The food---GREAT!

We weren't even offered or provided a wine menu. Overall we prefer Ruth's Chris uptown as the service is much more attentive and the environment is not as noisy.",

    "text": "Last night I went with a group of friends to Sullivan's Steakhouse for a birthday dinner. It's definitely a nice place to go to have dinner. The food was ok, I just think it's not worth the price. The Caesar salad is just a big piece of lettuce with Cesar dressing which kind of disappointed me. I ordered the salmon which was good but small, with the asparagus which was not seasoned. Now I will say that the cheesecake is amazing. Another thing was we ordered champagne and the glasses were dirty. The waitress had to go back three or four times to get clean ones. She was a nice lady, she even saved us some money by showing us a deal. After we was done eating we were ready to pay, the waitress took almost 45min to bring us our ticket and even longer to check us out. Other than that it's a nice restaurant, just over priced.",

The manager didn't come and check on anything it wasn't a good experience. The likelihood of me coming back is slim to none.",

    "text": "This is a great all around place. I love the dining room because everything is delicious but my favorite is the bar.  I like to go there since they have a great Happy Hour menu between 5-7 nightly and all night on Thursday. The menu includes sliced steak, salmon and a killer hamburger. The staff is always fantasic and friendly. I like to eat at the bar and on nights when it isn't too busy the bartender will keep me company. If you don't mind sweet girly drinks, you have to try The Knockout Martini. It's a fantastic blend of pineapple and vodka and 1 or 2 will do the trick. On Thursdays the Knockout Martinis and select red/white wine is $5. That's a great deal.  If you are looking for a good Sunday deal, eat in the bar from the Sunday Prime Time menu. You get a full meal with dessert for a reasonable price. During Queen's Feast Week they also do a great meal for $30 but that tends to get so packed you may have to wait for a later seating. I would recommend going earlier when the restaurant starts serving and eating in the bar. I've never had a problem getting dinner there on nights other than Thursday. Thursday is their specials night and tends to become more of a \"Singles Bar\" feel. Every night except Sunday there is live Jazz in the bar. I can't help but love this place!",

You might say I've never been to a steakhouse I didn't like, but that would not be True, as there are a few out there. Sullivans has a great bar area w/music and a cool outdoor patio open year round. Can't beat the specials on Thursday & Sunday nights. Sunday they do their $30 3-course meal along with $5 Knockout Martini, which is similar to the stoli-doli at Cap Grille. Same drink special on Thursday with cheap bar bites.   The menu is awesome and the wine list extensive. I always order the filet and onion rings...yep, great combo. Wine or scotch...or both?! Great for special occasions or just a late meal. Try it on a Sunday...always busy after Panthers games.",

Our server was funny, attentive and knowledgeable... I love the wine list because you can order by bin number and not have to stumble your way through an order... (I can recognize a brand and a label but I am horrible at pronouncing some of the names... lol) The Caesar salad had just the right amount of dressing... I don't normally eat shrimp, but the ones that came with this NY strip steak were phenomenal... The steak itself was also very well prepared... I ordered it medium well and that is exactly how it came to the table... Just the slightest bit of pink and a nice texture... The mashed potatoes were pretty good and the vegetables were just basic... Luckily my boyf doesn't eat desserts, so I always get to try at least two for CRW... Last night's options were a Bananas Foster bread pudding and a chocolate mousse... I couldn't really get down with the bread pudding, but my friend seemed to love it... The mousse was a great way to end the meal, though!",

    "text": "I used to go to Sullivan's several years ago when Southend was just getting going. I wanted to take my son out for a special dinner last Friday to celebrate his new summer internship. Thought it would be good to try Sullivan's again as it is pretty close to my home in Dilworth. Made the reservation on-line which was by far the best part of the experience. It went downhill from there.  First, I was annoyed they called me to make sure I would honor my reservation. What am I supposed to do, drop everything and give them a call to let them know I would be there?  Second, the place smelled like a urinal cake.  I felt like I was dining in a porta-potty. Third, the hostess felt my son and I should dine in the back private room rather than the main dining room. We were dressed appropriately and the place was not crowded. We did complain and they moved us to the main dining room. Fourth, the staff rushed us through the meal and they were flat out rude. The food was okay, but not distinguishable from other top steak houses. Wine list was overpriced compared to Bonterra Wine Room for same bottle of red. For the price, folks are better off at The Capital Grill, Flemmings, Beef'n Bottle, Ruth's Chris, or The Palm depending on your location.",

    "text": "A few friends had sworn up and down Sullivans was cheaper and better than other quality chain steakhouses we carnivores adore. As the much beloved, highly anticipated QC restaurant week is off the starting gates, Sullivans is the first stop in this possible gout inducing road trip of gluttony that would make Henry the VIII envious.   First impressions aren't much to gloat about. While calling for a reservation, I was told 8:45 was the next available spot. After having to confirm with my dinner mates, I had to wait on hold for ohhhh only a measly 7 or 8 minutes. Hmrph, lets try this again. Hung up and redialed, new person and now it's 8:30; uh okay that works, lets roll on out!   Upon arrival, complimentary valet - not too shabby. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated so, \"please enjoy yourselves at the bar and listen to the live jazz band.\" I can dig it, dirty martini time! At only $10 for house vodka, oh Sullivans you sly dog, I like you already.   Bingo! Our names were called to be seated and after you wait for the hostesses to finish gossiping amongst themselves and finally seat you, the adventure begins. The dining room is lined with booths and a nifty library looking room adds to the Chicago, Dick Tracy-esque decor. The booths though, don't really sit 4 people comfortably.   Since it's restaurant week, the $30 meal is offered along with a \"Summer of '69\" for two which has slightly different options and two sides. Apparently its offered all summer and cost $69, heh go figure.   Summer of 69 it is, with asparagus and crab fried rice as sides. While the crab fried rice is pretty tasty, the asparagus was itsy bitsy, teeny tiny. Salmon is pretty tasty and very buttery - meaning good salmon.   Now, on to my carnivorous inner caveman. The filet; I loved it, but am upset at the chef. The steak itself was way too heavily over salted. Once you cut through the Bonneville Salt Flat crust though, what a mighty fine, tender, flavorful piece of meat. The key lime pie for dessert wasn't key to the meal, but was limey.  Service was great, the waiter was on top of his game and while the overall meal wasn't top notch, Sullivans is pretty smooth. Since it's a slightly cheaper date, I hope to visit more often. I just hope next time the chef doesn't take out his pent up frustration on the salt shaker.",

    "text": "As a self-proclaimed foodie I naturally get very excited when Queens Feast arrives a couple times a year. I am one of those people who peruse the menu before the week even begins and plan out exactly where I am going several days in advance. Considering many of my friends are of the vegetarian variety I was really craving a long-overdue steak.   Sullivan's was convenient for its South end location, and we were able to get a nice reservation time to fit our schedule. I was impressed with the ambiance overall. It was cozy, very classy, and interesting. Photos of boxers align the walls and a large wine vault (mmm wine) displays their vast collection.   We were greeted right away by very friendly staff. The Malbec I ordered was delicious - but I could see the wine list being slightly intimidating for new wine drinkers as it looked more like a novel than a list. We then received our bread which was very difficult to cut (we even heard the couple next to us say the same thing) and overly flaky but overall it tasted fresh.   We decided to order the $30 Restaurant Week Menu but they had similar Summer of $69 (for two) menu that seemed to be a great deal as well. I started with just a classic Caesar salad (I have a thing for them) which tasted good but definitely wasn't anything super amazing. Next, I had the Filet with Horseradish Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans. The steak and beans were cooked wonderfully but I felt the potatoes could have used a little bit more of the Horseradish flavor. Overall the dish was excellent and definitely satisfied my hunger for a steak! Finally my date and I shared our two desserts Banana Foster Bread Pudding (WOW!) and the Chocolate Mousse. Both were very good but the Bread Pudding was a stand-out.   I want to try some other steakhouses in the area since Charlotte has a plethora of them but I would definitely recommend Sullivan's - it was very good!",

    "text": "We had an early dinner here last night before the game with my two boys and their buddy. After making reservations I read some reviews, I picked a few excellent and then read the 2 poor and 3 terrible to get an idea of what could go wrong. Usually it's either a simple mistake or a staff looked at someone which they perceived wrong and they cop the \"I'm the big paying customer attitude\" when in fact the staff probably was clueless to the perceptions and still has no idea unless they read the review! I found this to be the case with these, don't get me wrong, service is important but if you start your review off with \"The food was well-prepared and tasted good\", there could possibly be a problem in the mirror! We had two cowboy ribeyes, a filet and sea bass. All plates were well prepared, good looking, and great taste. One of the first things you notice is that there are no salt or pepper shakers on the tables. This can be interpreted two ways; you choose. I strayed a bit from my usual French onion soup and got the butternut squash soup with cream and pumpkin seed. It was delicious but a little too sweet for my taste so my 16 year old finished it off. I ordered a house salad to get some acidity to counter act the sweet and it worked out well. Steaks came perfectly cooked, and looked amazing. My wife and I recently went to Flemings and the ribeye they served didn't look half as good as this one. Matter of fact the bone in at Texas Land and Cattle looks better than the Flemings steak. My son's friend also had the cowboy ribeye and his too looked amazing. It just makes for a better meal when your first impression is \"wow; that looks good\". The other dishes were well plated also. We accompanied the entrees with creamed spinach and steakhouse prepared mushrooms, both well prepared with sharp flavors.  Service, where most people had their problems, wasn't ours at all. The service couldn't have been better. Our waitress was kind, professional, and presented herself and Sullivan's with class. She wasn't overly attentive and didn't disappear for long periods, just right. Kudos to Katelin, we appreciate her professionalism and kindness in her service. She alone pushes the final rating to excellent. Go to Sullivan's and enjoy a great meal",

They have the best Ahi Seared Tuna, Blue Cheese Wedge, Steaks and some phenomenal desserts.  We tend to get the Filets but sometime is go for the Cowboy Bone-In Ribeye.  I highly recommend the Gorgonzola Butter on top of either!  Sometimes they put too much but it's an easy topping to rake off if you prefer small amounts.  Also, the sides... I had the Cream Corn this weekend for the first time and it was crazy good.  I love the Baked Potato with some fresh chopped bacon.  You get so used to the basics with that side... but to have it done right really makes you realize what you have missed in it.  It's fantastic.  Sometimes we can get the Souffle but often get the Brownie.  It's 'souffle like' with it's baking dish and is always moist.  Just remember to save some of that red wine to have with this dessert!    To those who left 1 Star : I challenge you to actually go and experience Sullivan's for what they are known for.  It's hard to go in and judge a restaurant based on their lowest priced menu and trying to get out on $20.  Experience it for what they specialize in.  A bar menu is meant to be that... it's a bar menu.",

My omnivore husband ordered their three course special:  calamari, the wedge salad, and beef medallions, which came with two shrimp and mashed potatoes. I chose the wedge salad, which, happily, did not come with bacon, horseradish mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  First, we were greeted with a hunk of bread that could have lasted us for a week.  I ate the jalapeno slices from my husband's calamari, which were simultaneously hot and sweet.  The blue cheese dressing on the wedge was a tad sweet for my taste, but topped with yummy blue cheese and fresh tomatoes.  The freshly ground pepper cut the sweetness of the dressing.  I could taste the nutmeg in the spinach, which was topped with a scattering of Parmesan.  The mashed potatoes were creamy, and I could taste the horseradish.  Although I could sense the apprehension our waiter felt when he realized that he was dealing with a vegetarian, he recovered from his surprise quickly and delivered impeccable service.",

Another coworker complained about the steak not being cooked right. I did not try the desert because my stomach was still not happy with my entree so I couldn't tell you how the desert tasted. The table was not an even surface, but of course was draped nicely in white cloth to cover, so I had to constantly adjust my glass on the table so it wouldn't spill.

Before they recently changed the menu the Salad use to come with the steak but that is not the case any more. The Sides are good for groups so share some. Sides to try is Mac and cheese with bread crumbs on top , Creamed corn, Garlic Mashed. I usually get the Filet or the Chicken even though it's a steak house. It's very tasty. The Chocolate moose is good but it's seasonal dessert. If you aren't up to spending the money try the Pre fix menu or wait for Restaurant week since they have great dishes to try for a great price.",

They did a magnificent job of giving the filet just enough seasoning to still allow the flavor of the steak itself to shine through.  The sides and dessert were to die for.  We loved the atmosphere and decor!  What a romantic place to go for an excellent dinner.  Don't forget to leave the kids at home ;)",

    "text": "What a disappointment! My wife and I decided to take advantage of restaurant week and enjoy a steak dinner from a very reputable restaurant. This was our first time to Sullivan's and maybe things are typically different, but from start to finish things were not good. Our waitress said we would have bread delivered to our table shortly (I'll come back to that), she would arrive back to our table every 15 minutes or so long after our glasses were empty, our steaks were not top grade steak that you'd expect from a steakhouse like this, our cheesecake was room temp. And our server did nothing! At the end of the day, if your establishment is going to partake in restaurant week please give those coming out to enjoy your food an opportunity to get the real experience. Don't turn your nose up at us, don't provide us with less than the best quality of meat you serve your patrons the rest of the year. I can provide you with a 100% guarantee that I will not return to your restaurant as I was embarrassed that my date with my wife turned out so poorly. So about that bread. I know this will blow your mind, but it never came. Just like the rest of the night it was a complete joke!",

In the past few years' we've made it a tradition to visit on Christmas Eve to 'treat' ourselves to a night out before the busyness of the next day rolls around.  This year we were happy to see they were not very busy even tho we were told on the phone they wouldn't be able to serve us. It's always me, my significant other and a single friend with whom we share our holiday eve with. We sat in the bar; the service was phenomenal. We thought the bill was pricey even with a $25 gift card, but we were cool with it.   We all shared the Calamari which was wonderful. My SO and I shared the filet/lobster tail entree, both of which were not very tasty. The lobster tail was so bland and came without butter. Our friend enjoyed his ribeye. We shared two vegetable sides, mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes. The shrooms were average and the mashed potatoes were flavorless.  Coming away, we feel as if the quality/flavor of the food has really declined since our last visit and I felt a need to leave this message here.  We love our neighborhood spot and our holiday tradition, but not sure if we'll change it up next year or not.",

    "text": "Sullivan's lives up to it's name here, for the most part. The seared ahi appetizer was very flavorful, just the right amount of spice. The meat consistency was a little off, but the abundance of flavor made up for this minor detail. The deviled eggs, while as good as a deviled egg can be, I'd not worth the $9 for four halves. French onion soup is exquisite, and the wedge salad is perhaps the best I've ever had. The bleu cheese dressing is absolutely spot on and plentiful.  Peppered strip streak, medium-rare, cooked perfectly and tastes very good. The filet, also some to perfection, was hit or miss. One tasted so-so all the way through, the other had the gristle still attached and was half decent, the other half very good. All sides very good, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, shrimp cocktails. Desserts tried, key lime pie, apple crumble, and cheesecake were all excellent. However, the key lime did have mixed reviews. All in all, service was impeccable, the atmosphere is just a little loud (however the place was packed), meats overall very good, and will return if in the area again. The Kansas City Sullivan's is better steak-wise; however, the 5-star is still earned here.",

The wait time for food was extremely long but never once did she ensure us that the food was coming and checked on the table. Once we voiced our concerns she became a little apologetic by telling us she was trying to find a table that skipped their bill and how she had a $200 tab with this table. Clearly she was more concerned about that scenario than getting her manager involved and taking care of the table right in front of her helplessly looking for their waitress. On top of her horrible service, a service assistant told us to ease up on her because she is only here for 2 weeks because of a situation with her daughter. On top of that we never did anything to this poor woman other than inquiry about our dinner service, only one round of drinks orders because she wasn't present. Also no manager ever touched our table he walked passed several times never inquired about our dining experience. We were celebrating a birthday instead it was overshadowed by tara family issues and other things.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here last Thursday and I was excited to try Sullivan's because I've heard great things about it! It started off great. Our waiter was great (I want to say his name was Ken but I'm not positive). Anyway, I ordered the salmon plate (super yummy) and my husband ordered the steak that was on special that night. Everything was great until a waitress brought us our food. She asked my husband to cut open the steak to make sure it was cooked to his liking (medium rare). He cut it open and looked inside but the restaurant is SO dimly lit that he couldn't see. So he was pulling out his phone and telling her that he was going to turn the flashlight on to make sure it's cooked properly. She didn't wait for him to do that and instead bolted. Our waiter came by to check up on us as my husband was checking the steak with his phone flashlight and it was literally mooing. I mean, it was basically just seared on the outside and completely raw on the inside. Moooooooing. So our waiter took it away, they put it back on the grill to get it cooked through a bit more and returned with it a few minutes later. Ok so, three things: I ate my entire meal alone cause I'd rather not eat cold salmon by the time they returned with the cooked steak. Second: they just stuck his steak back on the grill. Not a new steak. For the prices we pay there, I expect a new steak. Third: the manager came back with the cooked steak and simply apologized for the mooing steak. I expected that we'd be comped in some way. Or a free dessert. Or just anything to make up for their terrible mistake. But no. Nothing. Nothing was done to truly correct their error. We didn't have any time to speak with anyone or fight anything cause by the time dinner was over, we had to be at a ballet in 15 minutes. It was a little disappointing that at a nice restaurant, they can't comp a meal when they made a big mistake and caused us to not even be able to eat our dinner together. That's a big deal to us because we NEVER get to go on dates (parents of two babies). And we only get to eat dinner together twice a week. So we'd like to eat together when we get to go on a raaaaare date. Anyway, needless to say, it was a disappointment. Food was good but the lack of action on their part was a little crappy. Not sure if we'll ever return.",

There are just other steakhouses that mean a whole lot to me. I hope you understand.  Sullivan's is like a good friend to me - consistent, present and convenient. The steak and sides have always been solid and the patio is perfection on a warm spring evening. The staff is typically friendly and efficient - even when things get pretty hairy on a Thursday or Sunday evening when the major specials are available. Which leads me to those specials...as Todd W mentioned - Thursday offers $5 Knockout martinis and bar bites while Sunday typically offers a $30 per person three course meal. The Knockout martini is my jam, friends. This pineapple-y, vodka with a touch of orange concoction is my personal nectar from the gods. Get one or four...and find a designated driver.   The dining room is much quieter so if you're looking for a romantic or focused business evening, make a reservation. I fully appreciate Sullivan's consistency and the South End location doesn't disappoint. Thanks, friend.",

This was probably my fourth time here and I just noticed a serious old school boxing championship belt on the wall near the hostess podium.  Pretty sweet.  Anyway, we went last Sat night and we were seated fairly quickly (with reservations).  We were celebrating a birthday and it appeared there were about 2 or 3 other birthday's going on that night as well so it was full of large groups.  Not a problem.  They were doing the restaurant week menu and everyone opted for that.  I had the \"Steak and Potatoes\" option.  Medium rare.   The steak came out nicely and they chilled a red wine for us that someone at our table had specifically asked for. Seasonings were good on the food and good char on the steak.  The dessert options were limited for Restaurant week, but the chocolate mousse was a nice finish.  The server was friendly and attentive.  Although there is one woman who is my favorite.  Cant remember her name.  She is on the top section.  The service was not too slow and they did not rush us either.  Even though we end up spending about two hours there.    I still really like Del Friscos even though it is overpriced, but I think Sullivans may have won me over.",

My wife brought me here as an early birthday celebration, and the atmosphere was very cool. They had a small talented band that provided background music which added to ambiance of the place.  The service was great from the time that we entered the door until we left. The waitress that we had was very nice, always communicated with us in regards to receiving our order, and she was incredibly helpful. Now as far as the food goes, simply amazing.  The Shrimp and lobster bisque is just sooooooo good along with the ahi tuna with the cucumber and ginger.  And ofcourse this being a steakhouse the steaks have to be on point. I had the New York strips and I must say that the steak juicy, tender, and full of flavor. My one and only complaint is the fact there was this group that was extremely loud but the fact the tables were close didn't really affect my dinning experience.  All and all, this is a great restaurant and I would recommend this to friends.",

The 3rd, 4th, and 5th was for their Sunday Prime Time special for various occasions.  First thing I have to say is AVOID RESTAURANT WEEK.  They're way over crowded, the menu is limited, and you're going to wait.  Second thing... DEFINITELY hit their Sunday Prime Time Special.  For $32, you get twice the selection as restaurant week, and the food is prepared fresh.  Third... get the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for dessert.  It's awesome.    Fourth... highly recommend Renee as a server.  She was attentive, friendly, helpful, and on top of things.    So in conclusion... 5 stars for Renee, the Sunday Prime Time Special & the bread pudding.  2 stars for restaurant week (and take any reviews written during restaurant week with a grain of salt).",

One of the hostesses skirt was so short and I mean short...just barely covering her buttocks.  My husband turned away quickly & just shook his head.  This young lady also had on hot pink 6\"-7\" pumps.... if I didn't know we were in a steakhouse I would have thought we were in a strip club!  Not a good presentation for a fine dining restaurant.    We were seated quickly in a back room which was more intimate and quiet.  We thoroughly enjoyed the light jazz which was playing.  Our server was ok.  He mumbled quite a bit, so we struggled at times to understand what he saying but other than that he was ok.  We enjoyed the Valentines menu and thought it was more reasonably priced than some of the other steakhouses  we had looked at.  The food was very good.    Upon observing some of the female servers, they don't seem to have an established dress code or uniform other than wearing black.  Some had their boobs on display, skirts extra short, decorative tights, etc.  Management should really look into this because it is really a bad reflection on the restaurant.    Overall, the food was very good.  The atmosphere was lacking only due to the fact you didn't know what you would see next with the servers.",

Mgr came out and said he will have my food redone and he will comp it. Never got my food because he thought he was just going to comp it only. So I guess he was ok with taking my charge off my bill and me not eating at all? But I get the bill and he still charges me for my meal even though I made sure that it will get taken off. I asked for creamed spinach as a substitute - the waiter comes back and said they weren't allowed to give me creamed spinach, so he CHOSE creamed corn FOR ME instead. What if I was allergic to corn? Why not come back and say that creamed spinach as a substitution wasn't allowed and what would I like instead? The only bright spot for this visit was Hugo who was on top of filling up our glasses and getting us fresh bread. Our waiter came to us every 15 mins or so. We'd ask Hugo for something and he'll be back within a minute or 2.",

We arrived about a half hour early, and the bartender Ryan mixed the best Gibson I've had in a long, long time.  After the rest of our party arrived, we were seated and our server Layla was fantastic.  She helped my brother and sister-in-law pick a nice red wine, and she helped us order and cared for us throughout the meal.  The food was EXCELLENT!  Truly EXCELLENT!  An amazing and thoroughly enjoyable evening was had by all--I don't know if we'll ever get back to Charlotte, but if we do, Sullivan's will MOST DEFINITELY be the one place we will go back to.",

Once inside, we were taken straight to our table (we had a reservation for 7pm (Saturday), and there weren't too many people when we first arrived--the place was pretty full when we left). Once we sat down, we were given our menus and our water glasses were filled immediately. The waitress came over shortly after and gave us a drink menu.  **Our waitress, Melissa, was wonderful!**  We ordered the Shrimp Cocktail for an appetizer (so good!). We each had a steak (filet mignonette and cowboy ribeye) and decided to share sides -- we chose the cheddar bacon potatoes au gratin and the broccoli. Everything was soooooooo good! (Except the broccoli--but that's a personal preference! It was just slightly steamed and didn't seem to have much salt. It was definitely fresh, but not very tasty to us!) Make sure to try the Gorgonzola Garlic!! So good with the steak!  Because we were celebrating a birthday, the restaurant payed for his dessert! We had the Key Lime Pie.  **Our waitress, Melissa, was amazing! She was funny and helpful. She wasn't overbearing, but she never kept us waiting too long!**  Absolutely recommend!",

I was actually embarrassed I had recommended this place for a work function. They had a million servers standing around bantering while tables had to ask for plates to be removed in between courses and silverware  to be provided... this is probably why the steaks were over cooked as wait staff was not paying attention! The front of the house did an excellent job at helping to organize a special surprise but the whole experience was ruined by the lack of attention by the wait staff who clearly did not want to be working!",

He also got it Oscar style and cooked med rear. This was extremely tough and had to cut even with the knife. My sisters steak was charred way to much, burnt on outside. Potato Au gratin wet undercooked and zero flavor and the lobster Mac and cheese, served told us you had, had zero lobster in it. It took approximately 30 min for server to return our bill and card after trying to pay and left us sitting with nothing on the table to drink, not even water. No manager ever visited our table! My Sea Bass was amazing, but that's not enough to bring us back! (I was looking to see if I got a response to my review and it had been deleted? So posting again, I had a picture of the Wagyu Oscar that we brought home thinking my son would eat it? Nope, to tough and gave to the dog)",

We ordered what now used to be our favorite Calamari and the dish contained very few pieces of it and the rest was jalapenos. My filet came out well done instead of medium rare. I had pre ordered my dessert, bit took over an hour for it to arrive. I had asked 2 separate servers to check but they never came back with any updates or acknowledgements.  Management was nice enough to discount our wine since the two we had ordered was out of stock. However, they failed to notify our server so of course it was not deducted from the bill so had to wait another 30 min for her to straighten it out with management. Needless to say, we will not be going back. Hope management makes some changes soon or they will lose more devoted customers.",

They came out with a 6-7oz lobster tail. I questioned it and they offered me another 7oz. This may seem trivial but the taste and quality difference between a 7oz and a 16oz is profound. The 7oz tends to be overcooked while the 16 oz is perfectly moist and succulent. I sent back the 7oz and asked them to send me what I ordered. They returned with two undercooked 7ozs and stated \"we took it off the bill but because of the time that it takes to cook the 16oz, therefore we cooked them both less so they wouldn't be tough\" not knowing how to respond I stated \"I wasn't in a rush\". Check please. I'll never go back. Not one manager came to speak to me. They left the poor bartender to apologize on her own. It wasn't her fault so I made sure her tip reflected the lobster tail still on the check. I'll spend my money elsewhere is all. At an establishment like this- just give the patron what they want. They don't mind paying for what they want. I wasn't there for a free lobster tail, I wanted an exceptional meal.",

Per the response from management on 2/2/19 here on Yelp, I clicked the link and filled out the details of the issue at their corporate site.  Now more than 6 weeks later, I have not heard not a word in response.  Based on the subsequent reviews here, most of which have been bad, it appears the pattern now is for service to be terrible, then management to leaves a cut-and-paste \"We're sorry to hear about your experience\" reply, directing guests to fill out yet another form, apparently as some kind of placebo, but then do nothing at all to remedy the situation or even make a cursory reply.  Talk is cheap.    Back when the company was owned by Del Frisco's, I had nothing but good experiences, but now that it's owned by the struggling Macroni Grill corporation (which declared Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2017 and abandoned the Ballantyne location around the same time), it's clearly circling the drain, one step behind its former neighbor The Liberty.",

We had an 8 oz. steak, potatoes, onion straws, wedge salad (daughter had Caesar salad) and dessert. My daughter had a 12 oz. steak. Complimentary bread is served before your appetizer arrives. Since we ordered our steaks well done I appreciated that our server asked us to cut into it to make sure it was done to our satisfaction. Mine was a little red on the inside so she took it back and returned a few minutes later with a perfectly done steak. It's the little things, you know?  They had a special, $39 per person, which is wonderful. But you have to ask for the special since it's not advertised. I think the price is reasonable for all you get, which was filling and delicious. I left there a happy camper. Definitely recommended.",

We grabbed cocktails at the bar, which they were excellent \"pours\", we then waited a little longer. The staff and the managers kept updating us on the wait. They finally had out table ready after 20 mins. They sat us down and the manger told our waiter \"Bob\"(who is awesome btw) to get us a appetizer on the house for waiting so long. The food was amazing, the service was excellent. I totally recommend Sullivan's as the perfect date night spot.",

We had the seafood platter and calamari to start.  Both were excellent.  Now lets get to the bulk, the steaks. I had a 12 oz filet which was a great cut of meat.  I asked for medium and they cooked it perfectly.  The perfect amount of pink on the inside. My other coworker got the 22oz cowboy cut which was just absurd.  His skinny butt somehow finished the whole thing.  Beyond this, the service was outstanding.   Pros: everything you could want  Cons: A bit pricey, but hey you get what you pay for. Plates are about $35-$55.",

I don't know what it is but I guess I just pick the worst nights to come here.   The first time they told me it would be a 45 min wait and I waited 2 hours before I was seated just to find out they were basically out of everything on the menu.  I actually banned coming back until I was invited here for a Christmas dinner this year.  I know this is a very busy time a year in the restaurant business but when you pay this much for food - I expect   1.)  Appetizers to not take 45 min to come out & be cold 2.) Waiter to not throw away our leftovers after we have asked for a box 3.) When the man at the table already seems annoyed by your service and then you persist on throwing the dessert menu in his face (let's just say not a good move on your part) *he is paying the bill  It sucks because I really like Sullivans steak and in Raleigh I have always been happy with my food and service.",

    "text": "We went during restaurant week. It annoys me when restaurants use that as an excuse, but I think it's a fair disclosure in a review.  Food was worth at least 4.5 stars -- maybe 5. Our waitress was wonderful; she provided practical advice regarding food selections, even as we tried to figure out how to navigate the menu given the option of the restaurant week prix-fixe choices. We each had the kale salad, which had wonderful ingredients, though the creamy dressing took away from the natural tastes of the kale, pecans, and dried berries. I had a 12-ounce filet, which was quite well-prepared. I like steak cooked medium-well, which earns glares from foodies and so I often get a lower-quality barrel-cut filets (as I did on this night), but it was cooked perfectly and I didn't notice the extra fat or toughness that this cut sometimes has. My wife had the 6 oz filet from the prix-fixe menu. Horseradish mashed potatoes on her plate had a \"seafood restaurant\" kind of flavor, but she ate some of my baked potato, which was enormous and yet perfectly cooked, which is often hard with the largest potatoes.  Two stars because the front-of-house management was not good and left a bad taste in our mouths for the night overall. Valet service was required, though there was ample parking right in front of the restaurant (that had been blocked off for the valet service). That wouldn't have been awful (it is free) except that when we exited, there were seven or eight cars backed up waiting to be parked and one harried valet attendant running to and fro. He paid no attention to us or the four other groups waiting for their cars, so I went over and told him to give me my key and tell me where my car was. That worked out nicely, actually, because my car was pretty close. If you're not going to let me park my car, though, you'd better have the valet process down cold.  The hostess and seating attendant were young girls who seemed to think it was their job to protect the restaurant from people they deemed insufficiently cool. I didn't feel welcomed, and they were not prepared to seat us at our reservation time (they didn't apologize, but said, \"you can wait in that corner\" and pointed to the three square foot area next to the walkway to the bar. When the seating attendant took us to our table, she started clanking around the extra glasses and silverware (the table had been set for 4 rather than 2), though she left them all cluttered up there anyway, and didn't give us enough menus.   The restaurant is too crowded -- tables are squeezed together to maximize revenue, I suppose -- and was quite loud: so much so that my wife and I had trouble understanding each other across a corner booth table (we're in our thirties -- not hard of hearing or anything).  Quite good food, but Sullivan's is a \"special event\" kind of restaurant, and there are places in town that create a special night out kind of experience, so I wouldn't go back to Sullivan's.",

Our server was nice, my finance's steak was more rare than medium so we did have to send that back and when I ordered my 2nd glass of wine the server came over and poured what was left of my old glass Into my fresh glass, which is a huge etiquette \"no,no\" especially at $15 a glass...

I requested it be cooked for medium rare. After 20 minutes I knew it would be over cooked and sure enough it was well done. So I asked them to redo it and box it up since my table had finished their meal. I had to have a few bites of my daughter's meal so I didn't starve. All they offered me was a drink but I don't drink alcohol. Worst experience ever at a restaurant. Our waitress also had a really bad attitude which didn't make the night out any better. We will never go back. There are much better restaurants that have good food and service.  When I got home I cut the meat off the bone and the meat only weighed 5.5oz. Totally not worth the $20 upgrade. There is no way the bone weighed over 8oz. Total rip-off.   -1 Star",

We went to Bonterra Restaurant and Wine Room on Wednesday night and the food was exceptional . We decided to try Sullivan's Steak House today and it doesn't even come close. First of all, I had to switch tables due to constantly having to swat a gnat away from my food. We ordered The Sure Thing which gives us a three course meal. I have honestly had better Caesar salad at Red Lobster. We both decided on the 12oz New York Strip Steak upgraded Sure Thing option. It came with their bourbon peppercorn sauce. The sauce is the only thing that saves this steak from being horrible. I have been to plenty of places that make you don't even want to dip your steak in any sauce. This steak was very chewy and not seasoned. The White Cheddar & Bacon AU GRATIN POTATOES weren't any better. Not seasoned at all. To make matters worse we were celebrating a special occasion. I seriously regret coming here. Never again.  Update. I responded to this businesses reply to go to their page and leave my review. I still haven't heard back from them as of yet. 07/25/2019",

Ordered the Sure Thing which is their 3 course price fixe. Arrived to no parking. Valet said just take handicap. So I feel uncomfortable and rushed.  I don't want to inconvenience any handicap placard or disabled person. I know the struggles.   Enter: no hostess.  I walk to bar. They redirect me to hostess stand.  I wait. She's sweet.  Gets ticket and it's double the cost. Someone didn't catch I asked for the \"Sure Thing.\"   This took several attempts to fix including a manager saying it doesn't exist. Another Manger says it does and boom... the head Mgr fixes everything then exceeded my expectations with a bonus card for an official apology.   I was standing in the restaurant writing this 3 star review when it jumped to 5 because of how everyone took some extra initiative to WOW! the customer.   I didn't get the steak I ordered yet valet and mgmt were on par.  Why 3?  * I called back to inform someone that they didn't check us in for OpenTable. *I was told it was handled. I'm sure it was just some server passing by and answered the phone.  *minutes later I get the no show email from Open Table.  * There's room for improvement and I'm sure they'll make it. This won't deter me. Just taught me to dine in, always.",

But this experience was just terrible from top to bottom. Jared our server laked any sense of serving skills. And the manager came over because our food was about an hour late. And made some lame excuse about the fact he couldn't discount restaurant week food.The other food was very good once we got it. The lack of attention and the disrespectfulness from the management staff was disgraceful.I have been to Sullivan's many times and I had the most exceptional experiences but this one failed in every sense of the word. I will contact their corporate office.",

    "text": "We came for restaurant week dinner. Our reservation was for 5 PM, we came 10 minutes early . They asked us to wait the 10 minutes till 5 PM although plenty of seating available at this time. At 5 PM we were seated. The staff friendly and able to answer our questions about the menu. My dining mate and I ordered the shrimp lobster soup. He enjoyed it but my soup tasted very salty and  had some spice in it which  burned the back of my throat. The waitress promptly gave me a wedge salad instead to replace the soup as salad was one of the choices on restaurant week menu. The salad was basic and tasty, I've had better. Wished there could have been some bacon on it. While  we were eating our soup and salad, the main courses came to our small table. The small table for 2,   now crowded. I felt rushed and would have preferred to finish my salad but put it aside to start my steak. This entree was served with green beans and mashed potatoes but for 7 $ more I ordered the sauteed mushrooms instead of the potatoes. My  NY strip was cooked to order, the bearnaise sauce tasty. The  unseasoned green beans practically raw, I didn't eat them.  My dining mates filet was tasty and cooked to order with a tasty bordelaise sauce , likewise  with crunchy undercooked green beans. Interestingly his filet had 3 deep score marks when brought to the table, we wondered if the chef was checking for cooked status. We never had a filet presented that way. The sides of mushrooms delicious. Food  came out hot and plated nicely. My dining mate enjoyed his banana foster bread pudding. I  had my skimpy piece of NY cheesecake to go. So this was a mixed experience for us. Normally the regular menu pricy. Restaurant week gives one an idea about the restaurant and the food. I rated a 4  only for good  tasty tender steaks,  not a 5 because of  our mixed experience above.  I've been to other upscale  steak house restaurants before. Not sure I'd return again.",

My stepdad's steak was almost raw and he asked for medium. My moms asparagus was cold. My aunts hamburger had way too much pepper.   That said, my meal was cooked perfectly and it was very good. My wife and cousins meals were also perfect. I had the King crab legs and an order of Mac n cheese. Both were delicious. If the orders were consistent, which I would expect for this type of restaurant, it would easily be a 5 star. The only reason I'm giving 4 is due to the manager stepping in and making it all right.",

One with a couple and one with a table of eight. I had received an email about prime rib Sundays here. When we arrived early in the evening the server said there was a miscommunication about the prime rib and had the manager come to explain. The explanation was that they only planned for eight people to order prime rib this evening. He was not very apologetic at all and what a poor excuse. He basically said no prime rib tonight and if we wanted to stay for something else well....but, he assured us there would be plenty of prime rib next Sunday. Well we stayed and had shrimp cocktails a couple of drinks and some okay steaks, but when you have a taste for prime rib well, you know there was no prime rib. We will not be returning next Sunday or anytime soon until they clean up their act.  There were three portable air conditioning units run in the dining areas and their sanitation score is in the danger zone at 90.5.               Well it's been two weeks now since I responded to the corporate website per their request and no follow up as stated.",

Our server Jarrett, a young mustached man from Hickory, was the definition of southern charm. We could literally feel the passion he had for aged whiskeys when he walked us through the beverage menu. If you order your steak anything above medium rare here, you are doing yourself a major disservice. Their medium rare NY strip will drastically increase your standards for daily living. Sullivan's is also known for its extraordinarily sensual ambiance for date night! I'd recommend this place to anyone, and make sure to ask for Jarrett!",

    "text": "We'd been wanting to try Sullivan's for a long time, and finally gave them a try during Restaurant Week.  Sadly, we don't plan to return.  We were immediately put off by the fact that we had to wait until our reservation time to be seated.  Their entry is a small space with only a couple of seats, and it was both awkward and uncomfortable to have everyone waiting until 6pm.  When they took us to our table, the dining room was mostly empty, making me wonder why they made everyone wait at this early hour.   Things got better once we were seated in the dining room.  The room is spacious and nicely appointed, with lovely big band music playing quietly in the background.  Our server was very attentive.  But sadly, the food was a disappointment.  Our starters--lobster bisque and wedge salad--were fine.  But our entrees let us down.  I don't usually eat meat, but their seafood option during Restaurant Week was just salmon.  What?!  I can get salmon anywhere, and expected something better, like halibut or grouper.  So I got the 8 oz. filet, served Oscar style (with bearnaise sauce, asparagus, and lump crabmeat, for an $11 upcharge).  My husband got the 12 oz. New York Strip with bourbon peppercorn sauce.  There was very little crab on my steak, and it wasn't worth the extra charge.  My steak was also cooked medium-rare, when I had requested medium.  I would have expected a steakhouse to be able to cook a steak properly.  The server asked how we were enjoying our meals, and I showed her how underdone my steak was near the center, and she offered to have them place it back in the grill.  Everyone knows that recooking a steak practically ruins it, so I said no thanks, and gave the remainder to my husband.  His was cooked medium-rare, as requested.   Both entrees were served with their horseradish mashed potatoes and green beans.  The beans lacked flavor, and the potatoes were no better.  I rarely eat mashed potatoes, but I expected them to be better prepared at Sullivan's.  They tasted thin and almost watery, with no detectable cream or butter.    Our desserts were good - ice cream for my husband, and bread pudding (topped with ice cream) for me.    I'm not a fan of giving my keys to anyone, and was glad we could self-park in the Steelyard parking garage.  It's a pretty small garage, however, and was almost full when we got there shortly before 6.  (It is used for both Luciano and Sullivan's.)  My husband did say their steak tasted better than what he usually has, but the accompaniments were subpar.  If you are spending this much for dinner, everything should be fantastic.  We won't return.",

I would go even if it wasn't, but it is a really good deal to get a three course meal for $35 . First I must say the ambiance was very nice there and it set the mood for a nice romantic dinner.   I highly suggest this place for a nice date, special occasion , or if you want a really good dinner. The service was the best part about this place. I felt as if the staff was going to get it wrong when we first came through the door because it was a bit chaotic.  Nevertheless, to my surprise they were on top of it.   We were asked how everything turned out and honestly I ordered a medium rare NY strip steak and got a medium steak. They mixed up our orders. I was beyond hungry at that time to wait for another steak so I ate it . It was delicious but hard not to compare to the quality of other steakhouses in the area. She got the filet mignon and that tasted better than my NY strip . Not to exclude the fact that she got the medium rare too.    Other than the mix up the place was great! The service, atmosphere, and food are all top notch.   I wish I could give this place five stars, like other restaurants on AP's famous must eat restaurants if you are in Charlotte (2018 version coming soon), but not just yet. Stay tuned!",

    "text": "Quality of restaurant has really declined in the recent year. This use to be our favorite restaurant but more recently the service and overall performance has been lacking to say the least. On Valentines Day my fiance and I booked a reservation for 8pm. We were promptly seated (not normal there is normally an additional 15-20 minute wait), upon sitting down we were given a scaled down menu that was apparently for that day. This was a surprise considering when booking we asked would there be any changes like they do for Restaurant Week etc. The hostess confirmed it would be a normal day.  It was in fact not normal at all, most and I truly mean most of the seafood selections were gone. We tried to stick it out, places the order and enjoyed the ambiance. A few moments late the waitress came back to let us know they were out of 2 of the maybe 6 side items they had that day. At this point we left and agreed to come back on a less busier day. We choose Sunday 2/17 for a redo. Upon sitting down we could tell the service was off but had high hopes for the food. The appetizers were great, my fiance order from the sure thing menu so he choose a salad and desert, once the server saw I wasn't getting either he offered to provide cheesecake \"on the house\" I declined. He then offered salad or bisque seemingly from the goodness of his heart. When we got the check we saw that we were not only charged for it but charged incorrectly. We are not the type to dispute each item on the bill so we paid and had the leftovers (almost the full entree because we had so many other things). Once we got home we noticed it seemed like we were missing items, however they weren't missing everything was just boxed together.. like literally potatoes spinach steak salmon shrimp all in one box smh. At this caliber of restaurant I just expect more. Super disappointed.",

Unfortunately, I gave up Land Meat for Lent so I could not partake in the deliciousness that is Steak and/or Lamb. I did however eat the next best thing, the \"Steak of the Sea\" if you will... Salmon. Oh, and a 1/2 lb Lobster Tail, so... you can feel my pain. Everything was upper class from the staff's handling themselves to the amazing lighting. As an electrician I notice those thing, but anywho, the dinning room was pristine with white linen table cloths to the spotless dishware. We started with the crab cake, not cakes but cake this is A la cart people don't look to leave without dropping $100.00 for 2 easy and that's with water. As I have said before dinning is an experience and not a necessity, you want an experience then you may need to spend a bit. That will last you a life time and give you a great story to tell. Anyway, I tasted no breading just Massive pieces of crab and the mini salad on top... Spot on. My wife went for the fillet mignon and she went Med/Rare and it came out Med/Rare almost fork tender good. So basic, so simple but most amazing things are. Next, and this should be your whole reason for getting up everyday at 5,6,7am and drudging yourself to an office, construction site, a retail store whatever it is that makes you the fund to enjoy life worth living for... DESSERT! They have your basic Cheesecake, Key lime Pie, I think a Bananas Forster Bread Pudding but, and you may want to sit for this one, Nutella Creme Brulee. Discuss amongst yourselves for a bit. Yes, a delicate balance of custard, melted sugar and what I'm guessing are the tears of Chuck Norris will bring you to your knees. It is... Punch a Baby Good, knock it out for all I care that thing is insane not to mention massive. It's not inexpensive but neither is the experience. Eat, Drink, Tell",

I seriously don't appreciate that - we were only trying the place BECAUSE it was Restaurant Week! Come on!  I did enjoy the food - once we got them to hand over the special menu. I was hoping their meat would be Del Frisco's quality since they are owned by them, but not quite. Would I go again? Maybe. The bar was cool and they had a good bar menu.   Please make sure you specifically ask for the Restaurant Week menu so you get the deal you came for! I really hope this isn't a new trend for restaurants during Restaurant Week, it's so tacky!",

My family decided to have thanksgiving dinner here along with two family friends. We had a dinner reservation at 6:15. We arrived promptly at 6:10 and used to complimentary valet to park the car. We waited about 30 minutes to be sat. Once sat we waited another long while for a server to come by and take our drink order. Dakota, our server, brought our drinks back and then disappeared for a while until coming back to take our order. We ordered two of the thanksgiving specials which comes with salad, two sides, turkey and dessert; we also ordered the one pound lobster tail, two crab cake appetizers and the Rockefeller salmon. The salads came out and we still had not received any bread or the appetizers. I had to ask the server if the crab cake was still coming or not. The crab cake arrived shortly there after. After finishing our salads and appetizer we still had no bread. We had to ask another server for bread to the table. Our entrees arrived soon after we got bread and were amazing. Everything was delicious absolutely no complaints of the food. However during the entrees, Dakota never came with refills and never stopped to check on everything. We then move onto boxing some entrees and getting the dessert, we waited about 15 minutes with no waiter and by the time we got to place the dessert order they had run out of the dessert we wanted. I got up to speak with a manager about the poor service and how it was unacceptable and he told me he would touch our table and speak with us directly. So we took the desserts Togo and waited for the checks. We had told Dakota at the beginning of the night we had two checks and how to split everything. The manager has still not stopped by and we are handed one check. So I asked a separate mama her from before to split the check and reiterated how bad the service was. This manager also assured me he would stop by and he would also adjust the check. Another 10 or so minutes goes by before we receive or checks. The adjustment was he took of the appetizers. After paying the bill a manager had still not stopped by. So we asked another server to bring a manager over. Once the manager got to the table all he had to say for the experience was that he agreed. He understood. It's safe to say we will not be coming back to this restaurant.",

Hell , I would write a review just off her . Now , I can't tell you her name ; not that I don't want to . I can't remember  ( something French sounding :John pi' Dom  )  She made me s few of these drinks she called nuts and berries and I was sold!  Everything was amazing! Please try the Banana Foster Bread Pudding.  Your mouth will thank you later!  But, this is a good example of how you can take a good bar and make it an outstanding bar just by having the right people behind it .",

Everyone was really pleased with how things went and no one had any complaints about their food.

Our server was sort of an odd older gentleman. He did do his best, but sort or Over pushed a bottle of wine...it was pretty funny.

When I am picking up a check for 10 people in a location that charges a rather high amount you expect great food, great service, and a great atmosphere.  Great atmosphere? 3 stars due to the lack of lighting Great Service? 5 Stars, very professional and accomidating, and very very apologetic.  Great Food? Negative 10. When I am in a dark setting (meaning low light) and I am served a \"RAW\" blood reddish pink piece of Pork then nothing else matters. When cooking with pork or thick chops one should be using a meat thermometer and serving at 170 degrees center point not room temperature. With this said, the staff and management did everything they could to make it right. A fluke, maybe but one that the manager will need to address with his kitchen staff.",

With a $50 gift card in hand, we decided to head to Sullivan's to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday.  With expectations relatively high, I have to be honest and say that we were underwhelmed (and our pockets where overwhelmed, as the high prices did not reflect the quality of our experience).  We both ordered steak, which comes with a salad. We both opted for Caesar.  It was a very large portion, but lacking in flavor.  My filet was cooked properly, and the bourbon peppercorn sauce added a nice kick.  The porterhouse did not get such gleaming reviews.    The brussels sprouts were undercooked, but I have to say that the bacon pieces were delicious. The mushrooms were good, but I agree with another reviewer who said they were quite salty. And I am that person putting salt on everything, so that says something. We ordered a half bottle of Cote du Rhone, which was probably the highlight of the meal.  We opted out of dessert.  The service started out strong, but started to dwindle by the end. I just expect more of a high-end experience when you are dishing out $200 for dinner with no appetizer and no dessert.",

Completely blown away by the dirty martinis we had as well as the steak flatbread and bleu cheese wedge we shared. Everything was amazing! Its been a few days and I cannot stop thinking about that wedge salad. Great now I have to call her and go and do this all over again..... Yes this has to happen now........ The food was outstanding and I can only imagine what their steaks and entrees are like. I will have to also return with my guy soon so he can try.... and all my other friends until I run out of friends and I have to find new excuses to come as often as I want. We came on a Thursday and it was unexpectedly relaxed which main be the norm but it was my first time and for some reason I thought it was going to be a bit more fancy and stuffy but alas they had a live band and a good crowd and everyone seemed to be having a great time! The service was outstanding we sat at the bar as always.  I love the fact that they have a bar bites menu for a sort of happy hour. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion and I cannot wait to go (like in the next hour for sure since now I cant stop thinking about it)",

The good: nice bar area, they had a great duo or trio playing a stand up bass and nice music.   The bad: we ordered from the bar menu, which had good prices and seemed like a good idea.  It was not.  I ordered the \"best burger in Charlotte\" which turned out to be a seriously salty, dry, hard burger.  I ate a few bites thinking it might get better.  It didn't.  The home-made chips were not salty at all, cold, and tasted like they were cooked in old oil.  Not pleasant.  My friend ordered a \"steak\" dish which looked completely unappetizing and she said was just about all gristle.    I won't go back and would not recommend this restaurant.",

Our server Jude was both professional and friendly.  Service was excellent.  What stood out even more about this restaurant though was seeing how everyone else was enjoying their experience!  I was sitting in the corner of the restaurant and had a great view of the dining room.  It was great to see people having fun conversations with the wait staff and enjoying themselves.

We were going to what was to be a 'party' with drink specials and bar bites. Mostly what we found was 1/2 glass or inconsistent wine pours and no bar bites. We ordered a flatbread off the bar menu that came out cold and uncooked. As it turned out, the manager returned our gift card because it took so long for our food to come out.   The people sitting next to us at the bar had a 7:30 reservation for the dining room. When they arrived, they were told to wait in the bar, that it would be 8:00. It had to be closer to 8:30 before they were seated.  We walked to a local favorite and had dinner as we left hungry. Why is this local landmark so disappointing. We meet a friend at Sullivan's every Christmas Eve for dinner, it's a tradition. This year we will meet somewhere else.",

Great wine selection, get a bottle for sure. Dessert, cookies and cream pie. I went on a date night and we got out of there for $185. Pretty reasonable considering other similar joints in Charlotte can run you $220 easy. Another bonus is valet is friendly and accommodating. Highly suggested my friends!",

Let me start by saying I came during restaurant week, but to me that's the time when a restaurant shines impress me when you are slammed and I will definitely come back.  That said I am not impressed, first of all my ceaser salad had chewy croutons, not exactly sure how you go wrong with a crouton.  Secondly my steak was very mediocre, and honestly I could have had similar at Texas road house etc, honestly if i was paying full price I would probably be a lot more annoyed.   Sorry Sullivans but you could learn a lot from your sister restaurant Del Frisco, which not only remains my favorite but also is one of the best places for restaurant week.",

The salad was large but the lettuce was wilted and the croutons were soggy. It was apparent they had prepared the salads much earlier that day, croutons and all, and placed it in the refrigerator. It may have even been prepared the day before. Before our salad plates were removed from the table our steaks were brought out with no where to place them. The four of us literally had to hold up out salad dishes while they placed our steaks on the table.The steak was cooked to order but the potatoes that were served with it had so my much horseradish in them they were inedible. The cheesecake was warm and pretty much tasted like a Sara Lee purchased from the grocery store.   Our service wasn't much better. The waiter whizzed by a couple of times and asked if everything was ok. Each time his hands were full and he never came to a complete stop.   At first I blamed restaurant week, but have been to numerous restaurants over the years and have never experienced such a disappoint. I will never return to Sullivan's and would NOT recommend it to anyone.",

Now, I like jazz as much as the next person, but the bar at Sullivan's is fairly small and compact, and the music was pretty loud.  It was good but seemed a little unnecessary.  Our drinks (a dirty martini and a Cosmopolitan) were good, but not great, and were $26 together.  Onto dinner!  Our waiter greeted us and kept mentioning how he'd heard how much we liked Shiraz.  Huh?  He said he'd even send over the sommelier to help us pick a good bottle.  Again, huh?  I finally had to tell him that I thought they'd mixed us up with other people because we had cocktails at the bar.  He showed me his notes from our visit three years ago (tracked through OpenTable?) when we bought a bottle of Shiraz.  Ha!  I appreciate the attention to detail, but it seemed like a little bit of overkill, especially since it'd been three years, and there isn't really an alcohol we don't like.    The fella decided to go with the $39, 3-course menu and got the shrimp cocktail, lettuce wedge and steak.  The shrimp cocktail was fine (it's really hard to mess that up) and there were fewer shrimp than with the full-price appetizer; the lettuce wedge was okay but would've been even better with bacon; and the steak.... well, for Sullivan's being a steakhouse, it was pretty bland.  It almost tasted like bologna to me.  Yikes.  On a better note, I opted for the cheesesteak egg roll appetizer, which was delicious, and the chicken piccata entree, which was tender, moist, and seasoned perfectly.  We each got a glass of wine - not Shiraz! - and our waiter had some good suggestions on those.  I really wanted to have a great experience at Sullivan's, but for the price, there are much better steakhouses in Charlotte.  Bummer.",

The bar looked nice and the decor in the rest of the restaurant is nice too. We both opted for the prix fixe menu, for me it was perfect since the filet is 6oz on that menu. My salad, filet, potatoes were great. My guest had a solid steak and bisque but potatoes were lacking compared to mine. Desserts were okay but nothing special...but neither of us are huge dessert fans. Overall for the price point this met my expectations with a really good steak and evening. Service was also good, wine was good and served properly, too. Will be trying the bar menu the next time I'm here. Probably not the best steakhouse I've been to in my entire life, but a solid option in South End for guests or a nice night out.",

I made reservations via Open Table on Yelp about 2 hours before we went to dinner.  Free valet service upon arrival (with tip, of course) which was kinda weird because some valet cars were parked right in front.   The place was almost full when we walked in.  Seemed like good business on a Thursday night.  The atmosphere and decor made it seem like an up-scale casual restaurant.  Service was on point for the whole night.  When I asked a worker where the restroom was, he actually walked me there across the restaurant instead of pointing or giving directions.  For appetizer, we started with raw oysters which were decently alright.  For entree, one of the specials for the night was a filet mignon trio dish in which the filets are prepared with 3 different toppings/sauces.  My bf ordered the rib-eye, medium rare.  My filets were pretty yummy, but my BF was disappointed with his rib-eye.  It was overcooked and the rib-eye that they serve here is not dry-aged.  He only ate half of his steak unfortunately.  Overall dinner was OK, but nothing too memorable.  We'll likely try another steakhouse in Charlotte next time I'm back in town for business.",

We both did the Prix Fixe.  I had shrimp cocktail, shrimp & lobster bisque, and the 6 oz filet oscar style.  Hubby had calamari, shrimp & lobster bisque, and an 8 oz filet.  I also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese for us to share.  Both of our apps were good.  The shrimp and lobster bisque had a really nice and complex flavor.  I probably enjoyed it most of all, but it could have used more seafood pieces.  Our steaks were fine, but really nothing to get too excited about.  The oscar topping flavor was too overpowering, in my opinion.  I liked the horseradish mashed potatoes.  The mac and cheese was actually shells and cheese...I don't recommend it.  It wasn't bad, but I've had better for a lot less money.  Dessert was on the house since it was my birthday.  Our server suggested the bread pudding, but I went with the s'mores cake because I wanted chocolate.  I probably should have gone with her suggestion.  The s'mores cake was more of a s'mores pie, and was rather underwhelming.  The service was okay.  There were times when my husband's sweet tea sat empty, which I don't think is okay when you're paying so much for a meal.  All in all, it was fine, but overpriced for the quality of the food and service.  Next time we want to do a high-end steakhouse, we will try a different place.",

Being an upscale steakhouse one should not have women or any shape or size wearing short mini skirts with whatever black hose/fishnets/leggings/etc that they want. It makes this place go a bit down in class for me .  Had din din here one or two times...not bad, but not the best either. Would choose quite a few other steakhouses to have an elegant din.

He was attentive without being over the top, and personable. Bradley even went so far as to get me a side of the seasoning that was used on my steak to take home. The entire meal was outstanding. All steaks at our table were cooked perfectly. My mother is a vegetarian who hates fish, she ordered the salmon Rockefeller and was beyond satisfied.

He looked like he was working hard,  but when you place a drink or food order, you don't go to other tables and take orders before you put ours in.  We waited long lengths of time for almost everything.  We were a party of 8, so you expect it to take longer with larger parties, but we were there almost 3 hours.  They seemed very under staffed.  Finally got our dinner and two of the orders were wrong.  Everyone was done eating by the time their food finally came. No manager ever came to the table to apologize and nothing was offered for the major inconvenience.  I'm sorry, any reputable establishment would have comp'd the meal, or offered something.  I don't even think I've ever been to a restaurant where a manager doesn't come and and ask how your dining experience was going.  Apparently, that isn't important at Sullivan's.  Never even saw a manager to talk to.  The food overall was only mediocre, so you can't even say it was worth it, because of the cheaper  pricing of restaurant week.  I can tolerate mediocre food but not poor management.  Needless to say, there are so many good places to eat in Charlotte, there is no reason to ever come back here.",

    "text": "I really want to give Sullivan's 4 stars but in comparing this experience to a recent visit to Longhorn, I just can't bring myself to do it.  Went here with a group from work for an \"appreciation dinner\"  Normally, Appreciation dinners end up at Chili's or Ruby Tuesday so I was completely shocked we ended up here.  Everything was great service wise.  Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.  The strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1/2 to 2/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.  The decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn't go beyond what he was expect to do.     Sorry, Sullivans but I can get better service at Longhorn and frankly I think their food is better also.   But still this is a solid or 3 1/2 star review.",

    "text": "This 4 star rating is based on service. A friend asked me out to dinner here and I already knew I wanted scallops tonight before I looked at the menu. If they had scallops, it was predetermined that's what I would be ordering. So they come out after about 25 minutes. Four bacon wrapped scallops. However, they were covered in a peach BBQ glaze What an awful idea. Scallops are one of those foods that needs a sprinkle of salt and to be served with a half of a lemon. God makes them naturally flavorful. Anything heavy will overwhelm that flavor, which was the case here. So I forced myself to eat these candied scallops. I have no one to blame, but myself, for not reading the menu in detail and ordering seafood at a steakhouse. It simply isn't a smart move. So I'm not going to dock them for having a menu item that seems like a bad idea. The Roasted Corn-Jicama Slaw was unique and tasty. Service was fine. Having been to Sullivan's several times before, I can say there is always great service and a good atmosphere, especially in the bar area where some days there's live music. The dining area is a bit stuffy. Overall recommended.",
