Do you like staff that dress in exercise clothes like they just rolled in sweaty from the YMCA to make your cafe au lait with a side of everlasting wait?  Then yes, this is your place.   Maybe Amelie's is going for that sort of novelty place where people go because the service is poor--like dick's last resort to something like that. Or...French people have a reputation for being rude, so maybe they're just extending the French theme to the staffing and customer service aspects of the restaurant.  Come on people. It was such a nice thing to see a place with at least a little bit of character and creativity open in south Charlotte--we have so little funk down here. Maybe that was why it was so much of a disappointment to have such a bad experience.  You have vast potential--your decor and environment is really cool. You have decent and different food. Your outdoor seating is nice. Why have staff that doesn't care about customers or customer service?  Be kind to your customers. Get your processes in order so customers don't wait 20 minutes for a specialty coffee. Be professional and look professional and take pride in what you do.  Do that and people may actually want to come back.",

Well, that wasn't a cup of cappuccino, more of an instant coffee with a latte-kind of foam. And I asked a barista if it was a cappuccino I ordered, she was positive. It was not cappuccino, it wasn't a good coffee at all. Very bitter, disgusting taste.  A croissant - not fresh, not crusty and just had a taste of old butter. Disappointing experience. I asked them to replace my coffee with their ice-tea - which is hard to spoil. It was good.",

My macaroon was lifeless, bland and way too cold. Hubs hazelnut tarte was also lacking in satisfaction. And then the girl at the register tells me a lot of their stuff comes in outsourced, frozen and packaged! NOOOOO!!! Sad days.  And do note, this one is only open til 9!

Walking in for the 1st time I saw a line. So naturally I stand in the line. The girls behind the case were just looking at me, didn't say a word. I see more people come in and they asked them what they'd like and the customers walked up to the case. Did they really just watch me stand in this slow line for 10 minutes and not ask to help me?? What was wrong with me that they didn't lend me their assistance? Was there a booger in my nose??? When the customers got in line behind me I asked them about the correct ordering protocol and they directed me to the case. Thanks to those ladies for their help. The Macarons weren't that great. Were kind of mushy. It was weird. They were also overly sweet. I took a bite out of each and threw them in the trash. Almost $3 each wasted. I did like how the space was big and open. I would return if I needed a spot to plug in my laptop for a bit and hang out. Other than that, they wouldn't be my 1st choice.",

I was waiting in line for the pastry case, but others wanted to order sandwiches and after waiting in the line, they were told they had to order prepared foods at the register. There should be better signage for the different ordering stations, rather than waiting in a ridiculously long line only to be told they could have skipped that and gone directly to the register.",

Kept things simple on the beverage side: 2 hot chocolates for the kids, my wife had hot tea and I had a French press coffee. We all ordered twice baked croissants and we all really enjoyed.  The service was very good and we had a question once seated for a staff member.  It was her first day and she had an awesome personality...very pleasant.  She explained she was new but she would do her best to help us (can't remember her question). As a local business owner, I would hope my employees represent my company in a similar fashion.    Most importantly, as a response to my first review, I received a note from Stefanie who expressed regret for my experience and offered to buy me a croissant and coffee.  Unexpected but the way a complaint should be handled.  Thanks Stefanie! (I responded back, but not sure you received as I was having technology issues that day!)",

We love the pistachio macarons and we seemed to have gotten an old batch (maybe it was overcooked? The normal crunchy/chewy delight was replaced by a solid, crumbly bite) for more than $2 a cookie, it HAS to be right!  - The ladies who waited on us seemed like we were a bit of a bother and they were NOT busy - the seating isn't as cozy as the Noda or Fort Mill locations, but it's a bigger space - so I can appreciate they're fine tuning. The overwhelming smell of floor varnish was a little disruptive too -but I trust this will pass as time goes on. The water station/trash can debacle mentioned by others is accurate (even on a Sunday evening when it's not jam packed).",

After dinner, we stopped by for dessert (at 7 p.m.).  We found the new Amelie's at the end of the strip mall plaza and, upon entering, loved that they recreated the look of the NoDa location and had plenty of seating.    We walked up to the counter to view the pastry cases.  They looked a little bare boned, not what we're used to at the Amelie's in NoDa.  We inquired about the chocolate croissants.  We were informed that they were out of them (as we could see in the empty case) and that the best time to get pastries is in the mornings.  Huh.  Frustrated, we just left, dessertless.  The cases at the NoDa location ALWAYS seem full of EVERY dessert whenever we've stopped by, no matter what time of day it was.  So now we have to base our dessert options on when we come?  No thanks.  I don't just want leftovers.  Fail.",

    "text": "I have to start with a confession.  I finally made time to visit Amelie's to taste their famous salted caramel brownie because they've actually shared the recipe for these decadent treats online.  So I had to try it to see what I was going to recreate.  Standing in front of what seemed to be cases of magic, I couldn't help but order a few more things.  Then I soon realized, I need to take pictures of it all so I can try something new on my next visit, and many there after.    The brownie was rich and chocolatey and the caramel gooey...okay, exactly what the name states.  It's definitely a dessert that you need to plan on savoring with a drink while relaxing and just enjoying the scenery.    The iced cinnamon pull apart bread made me nostalgic of the first fresh baked monkey bread I tasted as a child.  My drink of choice this go round was the creme brulee French soda.  What an interesting combination and pretty perfect for this hot summer day.    The moral of the story, whatever you order will probably be delicious.  Just order what makes you happy or brings back a memory and enjoy the ambiance.  Better yet, take a friend and catch up.  I saw some people \"studying\", but who are you kidding, this place is too cute to stay focused.",

I really don't care for most of the desserts at Amelie's period.  I think they are hard and lacking taste.  However, I do enjoy the seasonal drinks and sandwiches.  Lunch here is a good idea always.  The soups are always good as well.",

    "text": "The original Amelie's so near and dear to my heart, but I totally understand why they have opened other locations in the Charlotte and surrounding area.  This South Charlotte location used to be another place (near and dear to me) called Midtown Sundries, but alas...\"nothing can last forever\" right?  The great thing about the Amelie's in Pineville is the space... tons of it.  I know the original NoDa location is a bit cramped, but in a charming way.  It always feels like a small victory if you manage to get through the line and find a table to enjoy your treats at... but here in Pineville, there is no shortage of tables and chairs.  There's a faeu wall to break up the expansive space... otherwise the space would be a giant rectangle.  And it looks like they've anticipated where a line would form (if it ever got that busy) since the display cabinet is located in the back and the line forms on the left wall going through.  Same Amelie's decor everywhere... the blue stripes on the wall and a large map of Paris make the space reminiscent of their original location.  Staff and servers are just as friendly here... though they do seem a little more relaxed.  On the two occasions I have been here there haven't been that many people at the location so the servers aren't running around like crazy.  One thing to note is the outdoor patio and a couple tables off to the side... There are a couple of trees out there on the side of the shopping center, but makes for a hot place to sit since the sun beats down on the patio.",

    "text": "Went in today to try the hot chocolate after watching a travel show that highlighted how much better French hot cocoa is compared to the standard USA version. So, I ordered one and It was delicious but it was even cooler than luke warm. I asked a couple of employees at the cashier's post if my mug could be warmed up in their microwave but they refused and said that would violate health codes. They offered to add hot milk to the cold \"hot\" chocolate, which would have diluted it & changed the flavor profile as well as not doing anything to warm up the current large mug of liquid, so I begrudgingly declined the offer and returned to my table. A bit later, one of the young employees (who said she was a manager) saw me at the table & we made eye contact - she then asked if I was sure I didn't want hot milk added to my now very cool hot chocolate. I explained the dilution problem. She responded that she could have chocolate added, also, but I didn't like that idea. It would be a guessing game bc it wasn't being prepared from beginning to end with proper quantities of ingredients. She then offered to have a new one made. I was hopeful and thought it was appropriate for her to do so.  When she brought the new one over, it tasted nothing like the delicious first one that I had. The second one was very milky with very little chocolate. It tasted weak and boring. There was zero quality consistency. Also, the new supposedly hot mug was barely hot.  I just nodded and thanked her; at that point, it was useless. I won't be ordering their hot chocolate ever again, sadly. Beware, if they don't make your hot chocolate or coffee hot for that matter, you now know that you have zero recourse but to waste the first one and throw it away and/or or have a second one made. What a waste of product and money. Amelie owner/ main manager:  Train your staff to create propely heated hot drinks and food (notorious for serving cold soup) and if you refuse to serve hot food hot, then invest in a microwave for the dining area like some other eateries often do. UPDATE: Amelie management contacted me and was very gracious. Explained that what I experienced isn't customary. Also, its quiche is outstanding, as well as breakfast sandwiches, and tartines. This review and my rating was on the hot cocoa experience",

    "text": "I really want to like this location but every time I've gone it's been a bad experience. I go to the NoDa location often so was excited about it being closer to where I live. First visit to the Pineville location was opening weekend. Air conditioning didn't work. Ok, I get it, still working out the kinks. Second visit, I ordered a full order of mushroom tart. Got what looked like only a half order so I asked one of the employees. Since they don't give itemized receipts I was questioned by the employee as to whether or not I did indeed order a full. By the time they checked their records and brought the other half of the mushroom tart out, my family was already done with lunch and we were all waiting to leave. Also, the mushroom tart I got this time had cheese on it. My first half order did not have the cheese on it. Third visit, got a Napolean for the first time and it was completely frozen. Today was my fourth visit and probably my last. I invited a couple of my friends to join me for late morning coffee. We went up to the counter and waited patiently behind a customer that had a order 3 boxes of pastries. There were two employees helping with the order. Both employees saw us but never acknowledged us. Two other employees came up and talked to the two employees at the counter and didn't acknowledge us either. Another customer came in behind us and was helped by one of the employees that was just standing around completely skipping over my friend and I that had been waiting for over 10 mins for someone to help us. None of the employees apologized or anything to us. I ordered a cafe marcotter, which was never called after 15 minutes and I see the barrista standing around and chatting with other customers. I finally asked the barrista if he had an order for me. He looked on the printer and said oh yes, sorry about that and proceeded to make my drink right then. I'm not sure what's going on with this location but to come in every time and have something wrong is really disappointing. I'm not one to complain or cause a scene at the store but after 4 times I felt it needed to be addressed. I'm not sure what's going on at this store but customer service is just not up to par.",

You'll see Eclectic artworks, upside down tables and chairs and out of place chandeliers that seem to work well together.   The pastries itself offer a huge selection of options, ranging from cakes, cookies and french style tarts. Coffee is also extremely delicious here.  There are plenty of seating around and its mostly a self serve place. When I went, there seemed to not be enough seating on a Friday morning. Either way I am a huge fan of this place.

If you get a latte, it usually pairs really well with their chocolate or vanilla macarons. I would definitely reccomend trying them together!  Another great dish is the pecan pie. It's a classic southern dish, but it is executed so beautifully. The pastry is done just right and both crumbles and melts in your mouth. This continues to be a favourite in my family.",

Girl talk and a girl talk--My gal pal has never been here.   The outdoor seating is awesome. Never too busy--seatings always available. This evening I noticed there was live music! I hope it's every week. The wine selection is small but satisfying, I love the wine bar. I could sit here everyday!! I love the ambiance here. Too bad it's not dog friendly--with all this beautiful weather my pup and I would enjoy the outdoor seating.   A few of my personal favorites- let's start with the Sparkling Lavender Lemonade!! Love Love Love!! So refreshing!!! My second item of choice--The breakfast croissant topped with spinach, egg, cheese and spinach (ohhh my goodness).",

Well maybe if I hadn't experienced the Noda location this would've been an easy 5star review however knowing that the customer service, the taste of the pastries, the crowd, the hours are all better in Noda I have to take the star-rage down on this one.  The pros: Conveniently located for me and my family  Quick French Fix (pastry) Very easy on the eyes   The cons: The cost Hours  Taste  Variety at all hours   I could go on and on but I won't, I like Amelie's and will return to this one when convenient but if I had to choose and time isn't an option I will head to Noda especially since I can go any time of day or night and get a sweet fix as they are 24hr.  The people working here are nice (not as nice as Noda staff) but definitely friendly with good customer service.",

It started here, maybe not this particular location but i honestly have not noticed any distinctions between the CLT locations. The space is comfortable to sit in alone or in a group for hours on hours! I've had their breakfast sandwich and it is amazing (egg and your choice of cheese - i get asiago, greens/tomato and bacon on baguette, but you can get it in a croissant. sounds simple but it's just perfect) Salads, especially seasonal ones are good and interesting - with uncommon combinations. Dessert is a must...the salted caramel brownies, eclairs, and macaroons are all so so good, but if anything else looks good in that glass case, it definitely is, so go for it!! Coffee drinks are good and the baristas will make good suggestions with their seasonal syrups.",

Luckily the stars aligned and I was able to stop on my most recent trip. I arrived shortly before noon and casually browsed the pastries and immediately selected one Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie and a sandwich, the Croque Monsieur.  After paying I was presented with a number and took a seat, however it didn't take long before my sandwich was ready and delivered to my table. Overall the Croque Monsieur was delicious, and the croissant was wonderfully light with a flaky exterior and soft interior, however the ham was just as good. While the sandwich was on the small size it was enough to fill my appetite as I was catching a flight home just two hours later. Next up was the Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie, I simply cannot say anything more than you have to order this sweet treat, it was so good I considered taking some along with me through TSA, however if they knew what I was carrying I doubt it would have made its way through the checkpoint!  Anyways the food and service here were great and I fully intend on returning next time I am in town.",

Even though they selection of food and coffee is pretty much the same, the atmosphere in Pineville feels more like a warehouse with lots of chairs set up. The Ambiance is not as  homie, warm, or comfortable as the NoDa location. I still may visit this location on occasion, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone.",

I'm not big on their macaroons.  A bit too fluffy for me.  It's more cake like than I like my macaroons.  The cakes are pretty good.  The eclairs are delicious though.  Same with the salted caramel brownies.  And they have meringues that they do in different flavors sometimes.  Those are a deal and super yummy.    The restaurant itself is so relaxing and inviting that I could find it hard to leave when I'm relaxing with some friends or my sisters and family there.  There is always a line.  But it does move along pretty quick.  Their coffee can use some work.  Mine was pretty weak and I asked for the strongest blend they had.",

She was pretty impatient with trying to get us to pick our dessert quickly (even though there were only 2 people behind us that had just walked up) and couldn't be bothered to crack a smile.  She was clearly quite over it for the day.  Our various coffee beverages were very good many of the desserts were okay, at best.  If you like a rich, sweet treat, the chocolate mousse cup was very good.  However, the eclair, petite fours, and the macarons we ordered all tasted like they had been in the case quite a while.  The macarons were chewy, not in a sweet, decadent way, but almost stale.  The petit fours tasted more bland and gelatinous than I expected.  My father-in-law loves eclairs and said his was not great.  I know I sound picky but we came here because everyone raves about this place and I really expected desserts that would make me want to come back for years to come.  While I'll likely give it a 2nd chance at another location, none of us were thrilled.  Not the best first impression but we will certainly try again at one of their other 5 locations.",

The Pineville store is equally as charming and whimsical as the original NoDa location, the only bummer is this location is not 24 hours like the original Amelie's... Some of my favorite things are the Fruit Tart - I recommend purchasing the 8\" because it's THAT good and for $20 you get about 6 servings vs spending $6 on a single serving tart that you'll just be craving more when you're done! Also... don't ask me why, but Amelie's yogurt is phenomenal! It is homemade and there must be a secret ingredient because I've never tasted yogurt so perfect before! Last but not least - the Chicken Salad sandwich and Spinach Leek Potato Soup will make you happy dance in your seat with each bite.",

Well this is only 1 step up in taste while the prices are extreme for the product. The tart crusts tasted like they substituted margarine and shortening for the butter. The almond tart tasted like they used boxed pudding instead of almond paste. The chocolate lacked depth of flavor.  Who seriously justifies paying $2.29 for a small cookie when Costco macaroons actually have more flavor? To top it off, while 2 of the young ladies were nice, the young man with blonde tipped hair \"helping\" us acted like he was doing us a favor by being there.  He was less than helpful, patient, or engaging with my 91 year old father who was trying to describe what he wanted. I felt that the employee demonstrated no value for my dad and was irritated because he had to help us. I DO NOT reccomend this bakery!",

It really wouldn't be that hard to add soy or coconut milk as an add on. I would have paid for that, especially when everyone else around offers those options.

Their vanilla strawberry petit gateau was a tad too sweet for me with more white chocolate filling than cake. I would have preferred to have it the other way around. Their macarons were okay. My husband seemed to love his twice baked almond croissant and cinnamon pull-apart bread. He wouldn't share.  We all left happy with full bellies. Reasonable prices. A definite repeater.",

It's the best $2 bucks I've spent all weekend. There's macarons, croissants, fruit tarts, cream puffs, coffees, teas, and soup. I love the asparagus and spinach soup. This location has a nice patio but the interior decor is where you really want to snag a seat. There's boatloads of fun, French inspired decorations and a merch table near the pasty case if you can't leave without a t-shirt or reusable bag. Overall a nice place to sit alone or with a date!",

I ordered the cappuccino and there was a pitiful amount of foam. It also tasted almost sour. The macarons were beautiful and delicious though, and you can never go wrong with the eclairs either. The tuna salad sandwich was disappointing though. My friend ordered the salad with goat cheese, chicken, and strawberries, which looked really fresh and there was a large portion of it, so perhaps I'll try the salad next time.  The tables needed to be cleaned - there were empty dishes and mugs on a few of them too. The workers are friendly, and patiently explained the flavors and such for the pastries.",

We usually don't stay here for more than maybe 10 minutes so I don't have much to say about this establishment. I wouldn't call it a bakery because it sells so much more, including drinks. Consequently they close a lot later than many bakeries do. And for a bakery they have a lot more seating than would be expected. If I'd have to guess there's maybe 20 or so tables inside. The service was excellent for a takeout place. Although if I do have a bone to pick I bought two twice baked croissants to go and they unfortunately packed it for me in a paper bag one on top of the other so all the air inside the precious pastry will get deflated. I remember they used to use paper boxes for the larger items. Anyways overall good experience.",

Their pastries are so delicious! but a little pricey.. my favorites are the fruit tarts, napoleons, coconut macaroons and palmiers! I'm especially a fan of the cinnamon sugar covered palmiers. The expresso drinks also come with a free palmier on the side. It's a nice and open location. The tables are not all ideal for getting work done because of the lack of outlets on the floors. Plus some of the tables are too tiny to have a laptop, drink and food on it. However, it's very relaxing (when it's not too busy) and the atmosphere is nice for relaxing and maybe reading a book. I also like that it's open later than most cafes. It also doesn't feel as cramped as the 24/7 location in Noda. I wouldn't recommend coming in with such a large group. I saw that a group of 15-20 had come in and they used up all the larger tables and a few smaller ones. The tables aren't really made to come together like that... just my opinion!",

We moved through the line very quickly and still had plenty of time to enjoy the small handful of items we purchased. They packed the pastries up in to-go boxes, so I kindly asked for a few plates. Another \"girl\" (as I will refer to her as due to her lack of maturity) was very short with me as she simply told me no. I asked why they could not give us a few plates since I saw them sitting right on top of the counter. She said it was too much work for them to clean them since they were closing soon. Really - 4 plates? Then she began to opening talk about my family & I with a few other employees. Two ladies came in right at closing and were turned away in a rather rude manner. We had a chat with them on their way out and they were in disbelief since the door was open and it was closing time on the nose. I believe this \"girl\" may have be the manager. Owner beware - this is how your employees act when you are not present. You will continue to lose customers if not addressed.",

Perhaps I'm a glutton for punishment, or the allure of it being 10 minutes from my house is tempting compared to the 40 minute trip to Noda. Either way I have decided not to return. My first encounter was the grand opening, it was decent enough to try again. The next time it was my birthday and I placed an order for a cake two weeks in advance....when I go in to pick it up they don't have it. They were not apologetic in the least nor did they offer to fix their mistake. Simply unorganized and unprofessional. The next time I got coconut macaroons and a salted Caramel blabla coffee. Waited 15min for it yet it still tasted like straight ocean water. It's not supposed to taste like burnt salty tap water. Went again tonight, the case was practically empty, staff was rude, the dining area was filthy. Staff performing closing duties and mopping at 7:40! Not even going to touch on the lack of quality of the pastries purchased. Coffee was trash once again. The store is staffed with angst filled teenagers who are too cool to be there. Have heard employees talking smack about management/bakery staff every time I've been here. I am truly confused as to how poorly this location is being run. And frankly appalled. They need to do better. 0/10 wouldn't recommend. It's a no from from me.",

I have been several times with friends who ordered various pastries and gave them high marks.  Twice, I have had the chicken salad croissant and both times had an upset stomach after. So I am wondering if the mayo is left out too long?  I am sticking to lattes and pastry.  If you are looking for a quiet place to chat and linger over coffee, not sure this it.  It is VERY loud here and challenging to find a parking space.  I have been on Tues night and it is just as packed as Saturday morning.  It is one big room, not several unique rooms like the NoDa cafe. The decor does try to be similar and it is interesting.   You order at the register near the pastry counter, but there is a barista counter and they will call you when your order is ready.  A few others have made comments about the customer service.

She then said \"what do you want?\" So I asked when the cream puffs were made because they were clearly a day or two old and she proceeded to tell me they were made a couple hours ago. It also had a finger print in it. No thank you! A lot of the pastries were also mislabeled and there was not much left for being four hours from closing. I ordered a chocolate peanut butter petit four and had asked what was in it and she told me \"chocolate and peanut butter\". Oh thanks that clears things up!

I am so glad they open one in Pineville because I can go there after work.When I went it was busy but the service was fast. They have the best pastries but is it pricey. I got four pastries for my family and I. I got the chocolate puffs, salted carmel brownie, and chocolate cake. The chocolate puffs were so good. You got to try the chocolate puffs. Amelie, you got to open one in Vegas. Vegas is waiting for you.",

The black Forrest ham and Gruyere sandwich is to die for, and probably the only thing I'll order from them from now on. The croissants are soggy. All of them. Almond twice baked, plain, pan au chocolat. All terrible. Soggy, too sweet, and cakey. A croissant should be flakey! The macaroons are overpriced, napoleons can be soggy (depending on which Amelie's you're visiting). Coffee is hit or miss as well depending on the barista. Overall, amelies is a nice place to grab a tea and hook on to some free wifi. But, the food is mediocre, with a combination of a few stellar items and a more let-downs.",

It's a huge space when you walk in, with the counter displaying the offerings in the back.  If you've been to the NoDa location, the case and set up of the case looks exactly like the original.  There were some pleasant surprises at this location.  Over to the right of the Pastry counter in the far corner is a wine/coffee bar.  They have beer and wine for sale as well as a variety of coffee drinks.  We bought our pastry and espresso at the counter then went over to the coffee bar and waited for our drinks. We sat down at the bar and ate our pastry and drank our espresso.  It was a wonderfully relaxing time.  We most definitely will be back to sit on the outdoor patio and to get some wine at the wine bar.",

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with an ecclectic mix of tables and chairs, but the nose level inside is rather loud due to the high ceilings. You place your order at the counter, which can be a little confusing and overwhelming. We first ordered our pastries from the display case ( which is filled with delicious looking tidbits from large pies and tarts, to brownies, macroons, mousses and pastries.); However you just had to kinda find someone behind the counter to fill your order, nobody is getting you and along you what you would like. Next we proceeded to the registers to place our sandwich orders.  My friends ordered a ham and grueyre sandwich and I ordered the turkey and bacon with ham instead of turkey ( however it was delivered with turkey not ham). My sandwich was supposed to come with cheddar cheese, but they're were out of cheddar so I opted for Brie.  After ordering we went to find a table, the table felt squished together and difficult to maneuver around.  We ended up sitting at a large table meant for 6, that only had 3 chairs, right by the door ( a nice cold we breeze hit you every time someone entered).  25 minutes after placing our sandwich orders, our meals were finally delivered ( yes I know it was the lunch rush.... But 25 minutes is a boy long to wait for a deli sandwich). As I mentioned earlier, my sandwich was turkey instead of the ham I requested and the cheese on my friends sandwich was only half need and smelled like an old sneaker.         I guess the moral of this review is go for the pastries, but skip the sandwiches, they aren't worth the price or the wait.",

The cashier understood our situation and offered us a free eclairs for my hubby's birthday. My first impression with them: a definitely positive for the atmosphere and the kindness from someone I just met.",

My husband returned to wait in line to order a mimosa and then once at the front of the line he was told to go to the cafe bar to order...however there were other patrons who liked visibly irritated for the long wait and one flustered barista behind the bar. So he didn't even bother to order because he wanted to enjoy the drink while we waited and he didn't think it would be ready any time soon. I think we saw other people walk out without getting their coffee. I wanted more from this cafe!! I would love to return to see far better service to match the pastries! I hope they hire more staff and a good manager to run the place!!",

Staff is a little off putting at this location and the separate areas for pick ups are down right confusing.   The coffee is great quality, as well as the food. It just sucks that the staff pretty much ruined the experience.",

    "text": "A quick look at my profile will reveal that I'm a True Amelie's loyalist. What makes this location special for me is its two miles away from my office! Drink, ALL THE COFFEE!  You'll find the usual Amelie's offerings in a less compact seating arrangement compared to NoDa. Speaking of which, if you're nearby, this location is a great place to try the pastries because it's not nearly as busy as the NoDa spot (yet!).  They always have some sort of seasonal offering and today I tried the fall-themed S'mores Macaron. Scrumptious, vanilla, wafer-like cookie texture, with a creamy marshmallow & dark chocolate filling, yum! The Pecan tart is also great and it might give your grandma's coveted pie recipe a run for its money!  If you don't have a sweet tooth and are coming in for coffee, tea, or something from the lunch menu, feel free to bypass the crowd in the pastry line and go straight to the register. The Uptown location has solved this potentially unnecessary waiting with line dividers which makes it very clear that you don't have to wait in the line if you're not getting delicious pastries, perhaps they don't have that problem here.  Now, my only concern is my waistline. Curse you Amelie's, with your delectable treats around every corner of my day to day life. I fear I must admit defeat resisting you, but hey at least I get a delicious coffee as a consolation prize!",

I think my brownie had  also been frozen. It was crunchy and stale. My chocolate croissant was half the size it used to be years ago in NoDa. She waited until I was paying to say they were frozen. They were for my 9 year old and she was upset she couldn't eat them right away.  They didn't thaw well. I will go to Villani's from now on. They don't freeze their macarons",

The first time I came here I tried their strawberry cake-- I could not even eat half of it as most of it was icing and was too sweet/too much for me to handle. However, it is one of their favorites and a customer behind me really loves it. So it's really a personal preference. I'm usually the one to eat the cake and my sister always ate the icing, so I'm sure she would love it! I tried their eclair's for the first time too. They are good! I will stick to these-- they aren't too sweet but just enough to hit the spot.  I ordered a regular hot tea since they ran out of chai tea the first time. This time I was able to order the chai latte. Its okay. I will have to order it with extra spice next time and extra hot. I go to local coffee shops all over the world whenever I travel (I travel for a living), so yes, I can be critical.   The service is always great.",

The pastries were simply alright, macaroons were chewy and the napolean was obviously frozen because the puff pastry was chewy and soggy and the cream was on the hard side. I did order a fig, bacon and brie tartine that was pretty good and tasted fresh. Drinks were on point though so points for that.",

The coffee is excellent and the pastries are the bomb (I know, no one says \"the bomb\" anymore but I grew up in the 90s).   We forgot to get a receipt while we were there for reimbursement through the job. I called weeks later and spoke with the the manager who was happy to assist with looking up our order and texting the receipt to me. I worked in restaurants for years and know that kind of call can be a bit annoying. I really appreciate the excellent, professional service.

Could not stay to dine in, so I bought a small vanilla cake with a strawberry on top, to take home. And while it looked absolutely mouthwatering, I have to say that I was really disappointed in it. I cut it in half to share with my grandson, and the cake fell apart. Not in a good way. The cake completely separated from the frosting that was on top and in the middle. And neither had any taste to it. It was like eating cardboard. We did not even finish the half, after 2 bites each, we threw it out, plus the other half in the box. While I was not expecting it to taste like a pastry shop in Paris, I did expect alot more from a $7 cake.",

My 13yo son ordered his drink, a cafe glace, and the cashier was extremely rude to him like having a \"child\" talk to her was unacceptable. She kept looking at me instead of him. She seemed aghast that he wanted coffee and asked him at least 4 times if he \"really\" wanted an \"iced coffee\" (said very slowly). Give me a break. He is a teen standing next to his mother. Just take his order without the attitude.   My husband and I gave them another chance for a dessert and coffee date. Our French press of coffee was delicious and beautifully served. All of the stars in this review are for that coffee. Our pastries were awful. I ordered a napoleon. The pastry, which should be flaky and crunchy, was soggy and wet. The cream filling tasted off. When my husband took it up to the register to complain the cashier took it to the back. The chef in the back looked at it and said I was wrong. Uhmm, it was dripping and clearly soggy.  The cashier begrudgingly replaced it with two macarons. The original pastry cost more than the two macarons. She did not offer any sort of equivalent or refund. Not cool. My husband had a strawberry cake type pastry. It was frozen in the middle. He picked at it but it was too solid to actually eat. My replacement macarons were OK. One was good and fresh the other was freezer burnt.",

I'm a big fan of french food and pastries so this place is right up my alley.  Their almond milk latte's are fabulous, and they always have their lavender syrup on hand for their lemonade so getting a lavender latter is high on my priority list.  When I want macaroons, i go here, when i want comfort food of a crostini or croque monsuer, i go here.   But to be fair, i also go here when i need a light salad for days when i am trying to respect my diet.  :)  the setup is easy, separate coffee bar, they also serve wine/beer, but you get in line, place your order, then they bring you food.  its great for quick lunches or if you're like me and will park there for a few hours on the laptop.",

Our cashier and server Katie and her co worker ( a charming young man with dredds) were just wonderful explaining the different products offering suggestions and patiently waiting for my pal to decide on her food. Then for the moment of truth when the food arrived it more than lived up to its description. My friend had the spinach Asiago  tartine and a petite coffee creme and I had the combo-signature spinach leek soup and /2 turkey Brie baguette and for a beverage the salted caramel hot cider. While waiting for our drinks at the coffee bar those employees were knowledgeable friendly and informative.After our meal we went back to the counter and were once again wonderfully guided through the various and plentiful dessert selections. I was so happy to have introduced a friend  from out of state to Amelie's and have it show its best side ! We settled on the famous salted caramel brownie and dark chocolate gateau .I also purchased a baguette which is the best in Charlotte. Once again fabulous!Bravo!!",

The quality of the pastries just isn't like what you find at the NoDa location but they're still good.   My main concern is the staff. They are disinterested to the point of rudeness. I'm not the sort to expect servers to fall all over themselves at my expense so when I say they're bad, they are definitely bad. Please Amelie's, hire people who don't treat your customers like an inconvenience. I know you know this is a problem, I've seen your responses to other reviews.",

    "text": "Having visited the NoDa location several times I was quite excited to try their newest location. All of the food and pastries are the same, and the quality is very good.  This review is more about the customer service experience I had on the SECOND DAY OF this location was open, and the cleanliness of the establishment. Both were very, very, very, poor. It's cool that you can bring a lock to profess your love and put it on a fence, but the romance is kinda lost when you have to step over and around garbage and uneaten food that has spilled out of the overflowing trash can on the outside patio. It's real hip to have a coffee bar, but the cool factor is lost when the barista has no idea what Splenda is or even looks like. Makes me wonder if they know what espresso is, or is it all just coffee to them?     We began our visit later in the day and waited 30 minutes in line to order.   The young woman that \"helped\" us at the counter did not greet us and plated our selection in silence. The cashier was even worse, though she had to talk to us in order to let me know how much I owed. She didn't thank us or offer any good by. A blank look told me my transaction had ended and that she was finished with me. If this was my business, she would have been terminated instantly. Seriously. It was that bad.   The air conditioning was either broken that day  or they wanted us to experience what it is like to work in the bakery near the oven. The heat inside, combined with the fumes from fresh paint drove us outside to the trash strewn patio. It's lovely and the chairs are very comfortable. Sadly the dirty tables, and overflowing trash bin kinda spoiled it. One poor guy was sitting at a table near this trash bin and got a leg full of what looked like milk, frosting (could also have been whip cream) and some other brownish liquid when another patron foolishly tried to throw something away, and a big pile of trash spilled out of the bin. Thankfully there were no Yellow Jackets, but if they continue to let the trash overflow, they will attract them for sure. My family and I finished our pastries and decided to throw our trash away inside.  The first and only trash bin we encountered was full to the top. Not wanting to add to this debacle, we left our trash on a table and left.   It's going to be awhile before I return. They must get their sanitation routine down better and they need to weed through a few lousy cashiers and counter help before they are up to acceptable standards.",

The decor is cool but, not as eclectic as NoDa. The staff and barista treated me like \"just another customer\" (something I never feel at Starbucks.) The whole restaurant smelled of wet paint. I realize it just opened but, come on. When I went to the condiments station the trash can was filthy with food particles on the receptacle. Really quite disgusting. I was also shocked to see piles of dirty dishes on a trolly in the middle of the restaurant, right next to where you doctor up your coffee. Really gross. Hope they work out some of these things. I am willing to give it another try because, well, the coffee is delicious!",

Not a problem if they are out of this world. Not. The lemon meringue tasted like something which could be bought at Harris Teeter. NOT a compliment. The caramel brownies were so sweet they were inedible according both my husband and me. I have visited the NoDa location once and had a good memory of their pastries but the fruit pastries on Carmel Rd location looked not fresh. Shame on you Amelie's. All hopes for a decent bakery on the south side of town is gone.",

The young man helping us was very nice and helped explain several items to us. We selected our items and had them packaged to go.   Verdict. Macarons were the best thing we purchased - as has been the case on previous visits. The cinnamon sugar with chocolate filling is just divine. The rest of our choices were okay to bad. My husband had a chocolate cupcake/small cake that was pretty okay. My son chose a similar sized cake with white cake and strawberries. Big disappointment. First, the glazed strawberry on top was moldy!  Yup. Moldy!  There was no mold on the icing, but I cut around that part anyway. The cake flavor was very good. The buttercream is not to my liking at all!!!  I've tried it on a previous visit and thought maybe we had a bad batch. No. I completely understand that french pastries are often not as sweet as US versions, but this buttercream tastes like it has zero sugar. It basically just tastes like butter/fat. Given that the item was refrigerated, the icing is solidified and the mouth feel is identical to butter. Very off putting. Lastly, my other son's chocolate eclair was fine. Not great. Not bad either.   All in all, considering the price, I will stick with a macaron if I visit Amelie's again.",

I ordered one of the french sodas and the barista was yelling my name to pick it up while I was still trying to pay for my order.  I waved at her to acknowledge, but she grew obviously impatient.

Also, the line moved quickly and we didn't have to wait too long for our drinks either.  I went with my usual Fruit Tart, and also tried a small Coconut Pastry/Cake...both delicious! As usual, I didn't love the Iced Latte, but it was OK.   We didn't stay long (due to our movie schedule), but I thought it was a really good night here. Seemed as if the place was better managed than the few times before. As always, am so glad we have a super-cute French bakery like this in Charlotte and the surrounding areas. Merci, Amelie's!",

I really do enjoy the coffee (although the remade coffee can be Luke warm most times) but the French pressed coffee is hot and robust without being bitter. We did have slight mid-step today with the French press, which I am pretty sure was operator error, we have had this many times here and it was like my coffee had chicken pox, an unusual amount or grounds and not normal for Amelie's. My thought instead of putting the screen straight down they leaned it to put in the pot scooping up some of the grounds. Dumped it out and rest were fine. The little female server/barista tried to tell me it was normal,  don't fall for that one. All in all pull apart bread and croissant I had were great. Will be back!

From outside this store is pretty blendy (even has patio seating) looks like there's nothing really out of the ordinary going on and by and large that's the case; the thing is that at Amelie's 'ordinary' is a pretty high mark. I wouldn't dare say that this is the best cafe and bakery chain ever because bestitude is purely subjective but it is consistently well executed across the metro and the lunch options are reasonably priced. Made my way across the parking lot and into the familiar but less intense kitsch of le camp de caravanier, and cautiously approached the well attended pastry cases trying not to make eye contact with the assorted macaron. They was sitting there all tarted-up bright and colorful but my heart sings for the simple deliciousness of the palmier... Two and a half bucks later I achieve a certain special sort of calm and life goes on only better :-)",

I came in on Resurrection Sunday because I drove all the way down to go to my favorite Marshall's only to find it was closed. Since I'm usually at the NoDa location on Sundays grading work, I figured I'd stop in this location before heading back up.  It's located at the end of a strip mall and has an open floor plan. We are all in the same room. Not like the NoDa location where there are little tucked away spaces. I ordered my usual tartine and the orange rosehip soda.   If I'm ever in the area, I'll likely stop in for a treat.",

I was in disbelief. We came around 8pm on a Friday and left around 11pm and none of the tables were getting bussed. People had to just move dirty dishes off the table they wanted -- us included. There were also only 3 tables next to outlets so more of a socializing location than a working location. The staff at the counter was very friendly.. and patient. No eye rolling when I asked them to read off every single macaroon flavor and then stand there in indecision for 30 seconds :)   Side note: the one macaroon that I got that wasn't stale may be my new favorite. CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH! The inside even had that classic cookie dough grit to it. This really should be a year round flavor. Amazing.",

But I think it might have been because they sold a lot of stuff, so next time I will go earlier in the day. I ordered a peach tart. I am a southern girl so it looked like a peach pie to me. I asked if it was sweet and the associate said yes so I choose it. I wanted to get the macaroons cause they are so big but I didn't. But the next time I make a cake I will. Back to subject the tart was really not that sweet at all. It had a peachy taste to it. The middle is like a moist pound cake almost. It was a really nice not too sugary desert so I don't feel bad about eating it! Lol. The atmosphere in the restaurant was really nice as well. There was a group chatting and eating. Nice restaurant.",

I don't like that no one seems to know about, have on hand nor recall they once sold a cream cheese filled croissant. It was such a RATATOUILLE critic moment. It took me back to elementary school when I'd tag along or be forced to go with my while she grocery shopped and her treat to the kid with all the allergies was a  Cream cheese filled croissant from Brookshire's. It was our HarrisTeeter before Krogers bought some interest.   And, when I found  Strawberry cream cheese croissant as an upgrade it was...alas my sentiments and feelings run deep, huh?!?!   Either way, cute chic place. Prices still High but it's expected and the score is for someone trying to push that cheese danish on me like cream cheese filled croissants can't return. They have chocolate filled though.    Maybe it's just this location.",

The caramel brownies and macaroons are a must. Also, they have creme brulee, mousse cups, and tea cakes.   I would love if they expanded the selection of gluten free items a little more. But don't we all.  If I had a recommendation, it would be to separate the Gluten free Items in a different display case just to avoid cross contamination. I'm sure We're not the only celiacs that pause when buying, wondering if the items are contaminated.  For non celiacs, I got the baguette and that poor thing didn't make it out of the parking lot.

My dining mate ordered a latte which came with a steamed milk design  that adorned the top. He said it was delicious. We split a French maccaroon just to try one. Delicious but pricey,  as one cost about $2.50. The restaurant was packed at lunch, food looked great from the diners sitting around us. A must try for lunch. Open 7 days a week, but hours vary.

Coffee was just ok and I have no idea if refills are available because no one offered. Left a 20% tip on my tab but not sure why. Staff seemed indifferent and not terribly service oriented. Large, busy kitchen but I didn't see anyone checking on tables on the floor other than to deliver food with a grunt. Men's room was an embarrassment. Old fixtures, odor, certainly not a French \"toilette.\" Overall I wasn't impressed with the eat-in experience. Maybe this is a takeout-only destination.",

Then I was told 75 cents would be added for the cheese. So if you want fromage on your jambon et fromage sandwich you have to pay extra for the cheese of your choice. A little bait and switch as far as I am concerned.  At least add the surcharge to the menu board.",

All of their baked goods are good, their soups are amazing, and their french sodas are to die for. I would personally recommend the basil lime macroon, which is only seasonal. The staff is nice and when they mess up an order they leave it with you (if you want it of course) which is good when your paying quite a high price for it. Definitely coming back again.",

More spacious layout- it's more open than the other Amelie's in NoDa.  2. Not as crowded, easier to find a table!  3. Same lovely decor and food as the other Amelie's. 4. Outdoor seating   As for the food, I've been to Amelie's so many times to know what's good now. The salted caramel brownies are a must try- they are a bit heavy though so splitting one is a perfect amount. I love the macaroons there! The fruit tarts are cute but I don't think they are worth the price. Also, the creme brulee isn't that worth it either. I would try the other desserts that aren't as sweet like croissants!   **free wifi!",

Had the turkey and bacon sandwich which was delicious and they even switched the cheese because I asked. My friend had granola/yogurt which she enjoyed. The macaroons are divine!! I tried passion fruit and berry. The lavender is another favorite. Like the plethora of tables and my advice is go early for lunch.",

    "text": "I come here more for the atmosphere than the food. With the exception of the palmiers and the twice baked croissants, I've had better. Everything I've tried was just OK, nothing to wow over.  My most recent visit was during breakfast and I had a ham, cheese, and egg croissant that, in my opinion, could've passed for a Burger King Croissan'wich. Enjoy your breakfast with the Cafe Fouette (4 shots of espresso, vanilla bean syrup, cream) and it saves the day!  One big disappointment for me during my visits has been the macarons. Sure they look nice and pretty all lined up in the case, but when you bite into them, it's not what a macaron experience should be. For some reason I keep ordering a few every time I come in hoping that \"this batch will be better than the last\", but it never turns out that way. They're hard shelled (like biting into a rock) and not as chewy or airy as I expect. For macarons that are done right, go to Renaissance Patisserie or Cafe Monte.  I can't leave out the salted caramel brownies. They're my wife's favorite and she contributes constantly to the sold tally they have on the wall. They are pretty decent. Grab a few when you're here!",

I have seen bible study, women meeting, and girls hanging out, People with dyed hair, no hair, and wings, pre-med Student studying and groups catching up. This is an inclusive space and more importantly a safe one. I am actually a fan of their pastries although my friends would beg to differ. They love the savory soups and sandwiches. I started my Amelie affection based on the tart (hazelnut was my fav) but have shifted to their palmers, macrons and recently sticky buns. They have an eclectic variety of options made fresh daily and with that being said it can be hit or miss on the available options. Be open-minded while going as the prices are not for the faint of heart. The decor is cute and Parisian inspired which is a cute homage. Now that they have branched out I have found that there are more locations in and around charlotte and can always sneak in for a quite bite, download, coffee or chat with friends. I highly suggest you give it a try. Don't be surprised if you being to plan your next vaca to Paris. Bonjour!",

    "text": "This place is a darling of the south Charlotte scene. It does a great job churning out French- style pastries and bistro-ey small plates of all varieties. But, if you're going to double down on the Frenchness, you've got to do something else well: have decent bar service. And by \"decent,\" I have to explain it this way: bad service chases off one customer at a time.  Bad sanitation practice closes the restaurant all at once.  I seriously don't know how this place can't serve sugar or cream at the bar, and how they have can say that they don't have room for sugar service, when the bar is covered with scattered drink menus and uncollected service. I was told that the having to walk over to the central sweetener/dairy table provides a more \"communal\" feel, and that they could \"get [me] a belltop of sugar, I guess, if you really want it.\" I did, but it as apparent that they weren't anywhere near prepared to offer me such a service while my double-shot was still on the warm side.   I sugared my drink and then walked back to my seat at the bar. Maybe this inconvenience made me a little more sensitive as I watched my date's cold drink being made with dirty shakers out of the dish sink (full of  a who-knows-how-old dairy spill), after I'd watched the \"baristas\" wipe my espresso cup off with the wet counter rag sitting on the cup warmer above the coffee machine, and the dumbfounded look I got when I asked the hipster guy in the skullie to remake it with clean glassware. I'm prone to think that it speaks to an overall service laziness at this place, or at least at the coffee bar. That thought was especially amplified as I stared into two open cambros of sugar (turbinado and plain old Dixie crystals) sitting DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME.   Maybe it was an off day. The pastry side of the house always does it right (except the older, stale version of the eclair that we bought, and tossed out, once we got it home), and they've even told us the secret that they aren't ever really out of anything, you just need to insist that they go get some more from \"the back.\" This has kept us coming back. We will be back again, for pastries. But, if you want to play French, just get the basics right. Bistro tables don't make the atmosphere- good service does. A little bit of a step up in standard, and this could be a great place to eat/drink.",

Very open and the layout is more conducive to having an actual line vs how the original shop is set up. I like the fact that there's an outside patio as well.  The two things I could see them improving on is maybe adding another register if they do have a rush and adding some more areas to put your leftover plates. Besides that, I can see this place being a welcome addition to the south side of the city.",

The bar gets backed up & having to stand & wait for a tea refill is nuts!   Seating: They Need more seating & comfy chairs that are NOT hard flat bottomed chairs or garden chairs.   To have such a cute French bakery, this location needs to ADD a few more partitions/French screens/shutters/walls to separate the seating on the entrance side & the center of the restaurant.  The glare from the sun can be harsh at noon. So putting up partitions or putting up blinds would really help with this problem.",

    "text": "My family and I did not have a good experience at this Amelie's and I was all set to give a one star rating. However, the manager eventually gave us a gift card to make it right so I'll go up to a 3 star. I appreciate the gesture but they do still need to work on their customer service big time. The  food is good (same menu as the other Amelie's locations) but the service is not up to par with the NoDa location.  The trouble started when they got my mom's order wrong. In and of itself this isn't a big deal, but then they took forever to fix it. It wasn't all that crowded when we went and it shouldn't take twenty minutes to remake a roast beef sandwich especially when you've already messed up the first sandwich. My mom actually had to go up to the register after about fifteen minutes had passed to ask where her sandwich was so there's a distinct possibility that it would've taken even longer had she not made her presence known. When the manager eventually got around to getting her the sandwich, she didn't really offer an explanation as to why it took so long and she didn't even really apologize until my normally mild mannered mom started fussing. My mom pointed out that we should get some kind of discount for the inconvenience and the 'manager' just ignored her. Awkward. I understand that sometimes there are rules about giving discounts and maybe she wasn't able to but if that's the case, she should've said something like 'I'm sorry but we can't do that' instead of just ignoring a customer. We did eventually get a gift card but that was later after a second mistake. She was extremely unprofessional and didn't seem like she should be in a management role.  The trouble continued when I got a to go order of one of their spreads. Once again, they got the order wrong (I should've checked it but I didn't expect our order to be wrong TWICE). When we realized that another mistake had been made (after getting all the way back home), we called and complained. When I went to pick up my fixed order, we were given a 30 dollar gift card, a few coupons for salted caramel brownies and an extra spread. This basically meant our meal was completely comped and I do appreciate that but I still feel like I can't go higher than a 3 because it took a whole lot of fussing and multiple mistakes for them to finally make it right. Also, the manager that gave us the gift cards was not the same person as the original 'manager' we dealt with. I guess it's possible that they had two on duty but that seems odd since this location isn't that busy. I suspect that the first person may have lied about being a manager (both because of her lack of professionalism and my skepticism about the need for having two on duty).  TLDR-the lines here are much shorter than at the NoDa location but the poor service makes the experience less pleasant. Just go to the NoDa location during off peak hours!",

It's all nice, but there's nothing fancy or \"hidden gem\" about this place. This isnt the quiet study spot that i expected it to be, but maybe I'm comparing it too much to NoDa? The staff doesn't help much either. I've been here 3 or 4 times and every time I feel like I'm not hip enough - and Lord knows, it could just be me. Haha. When I order at the counter, I feel like I'm interrupting something, or not doing it right. There's not a whole lot of explanation - more \"what do you want?\". Nah mean?  So, I'll continue eating my sandwich and floating on their wifi. I'm not in love with this location like I thought I would be. I think if I didn't know what to expect, and had never heard of Amelie's, it might bring in another star - but only for the unique decorating.   It's fine, and I'll come here again for coffee... *womp womp*",

Their new Pineville location still produces quality bakery goods but the eclectic atmosphere fails to make the grade. Beat up tables, etc., OK but dark and dank with kids running around uncontrolled whilst their mothers chit chat does not a nice morning make.",

My wife and I have been to France, and while you'd be hard pressed to find the equivalent in the US, Amelie's does a fantastic job and we have no complaints.  Try the breakfast sandwiches, croissant with gruyere and bacon is my fave.  The Monkey Bread is amazing.  Wife loves the coffee and the various pastries are as good as you're going to find in NC.  Give the place a shot, you won't be disappointed.  Try off-peak hours if you're concerned about waiting for your food.  We've never had a problem, but I see some people complain about that.",

    "text": "Thee worst customer service... Okay not the worse but it was kind of up there. I had my lips tooted for a brownie. TOOTED! I just wanted a regular brownie and I don't know what I was thinking cuz I know they don't have them at the NODA location, so why would they have them here... but it's all good. I know they have the caramel brownies which my husband loves and purchased 3 of them as usual.   Okay on to the disservice. We walk in and we're the only ones at the counter. A young girl and guy are talking and don't even bother to acknowledge us. I guess once we get closer to look like we're about to order something they're standing in front of us still talking. I guess the young girl is ready to take our order as she just looks at us. No \"hi\". No \"how can I help you? No \"what do you want?, so I just start ordering. Now normally I would just leave but I could not for the life of me think of a place to buy a single brownie... Just one.   So I ordered one of the triple chocolate layered joints and a macaroon. Figured I get something cuz my dude was not deterred by the service. Nothing was going to get in the way of him and a caramel brownie.   Get to the register and the dude says nothing. Just rings up our order. I mean do these people get tips? They can't be. They're horrible. It's like they dropped off the leftovers from the NODA spot which I've never had any semblance of an issue at that location. Anywho my dude comments on the horrible service once we left. I guess he may go back because he can't part with his precious caramel brownie. I think I can convince him not to.I'm not giving my money to a place where a person can't say one simple word \"hi\" to me. We figure we'll just venture over to the other spot. It's closer to our jobs anyway.   FYI: I gots my brownie at the Fresh Market right down the street. Bonus: I got a lemon bar too. How were they? SLAMMIN!!!",

As for coffee, I'd would not recommend it; I ordered a latte and a cappuccino but they were both lattes. I don't think the person was sure as to what he was making and they both ended up lattes.",

The Vanilla Strawberry Petit Gateaux was the best item and everyone agreed it was the favorite from the dozen or so we tried as a group. Will definitely be back if we are in the area again.",
