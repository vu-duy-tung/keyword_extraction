So I gave it back and ordered pulled pork which didn't taste good at all. The bowl of chili that I had was cold in temperature. I used to love the green bean casserole here, but even that doesn't taste good anymore. The only good thing about this was that the server was really nice, and manager helpful too. It's not there fault their cook was terrible so I still left a good tip.",

    "text": "I've had two incredibly different experiences at this place. One so great that I was dying to come back and the subsequent one so shitty that I'm not sure if I'll ever return.  The first time was with a friend who was passing through Charlotte. We sat outside to enjoy the amazing weather and catch up. He had a ton of wings (they were half off) and I had the brisket sandwich. We started the meal with fried pickles and pimento cheese. Everything rocked, from the service to the meal.  The second time I brought my girl, sat outside again (in the same table even), and looked forward to another great meal. What we received instead was horrible service. Our waitress cared so little about what she was doing it felt like she was in physical pain just having to stand there and take our order. We had better service from the other waitresses handling the outside than from our own. We could only suffer through ordering a drink and then left as quickly as we could.  I'm torn. Five stars on one hand and one star on another. I know that two data points don't make a trend, but after such an uneven experience I find it difficult to convince myself to go back for a third time.",

We went in for a late lunch today and found that the menu changed two weeks ago.... The Switchback Salad was gone from the menu. It was hands- down the BEST salad in the area. I was so disappointed to see it removed. I did try the new spinach salad as a side with the beer can chicken. The flavors of the salad didn't work well together and the chicken was incredibly dry. Such a disappointment for a local favorite! It will be a while before I give it a try again.",

The ribs definitely have an intense smoke flavor to them. At first I wasn't too thrilled about the beans but when I reheated the next day they were more appealing to me. I also ordered a cup of chili and while they didn't add the jalapenos I wasn't too upset and did enjoy it. Very meaty, not sure what all was in it but I finished every bit of bit. I ordered a sweet tea but it wasn't very sweet, but hey, who comes here for the sweet tea. I want to come back for try more of their menu, but I was surprised my how small the sitting area is. They have lots of high pub style tables with the low level seating along the walls of the restaurant. If you're not a fan of pork I would suggest you ask what is in everything prior to ordering the beans, chili, collards..",

I hate consistently for a full hour without stopping, and got a little less than halfway through it. The bread is equivalent to a full loaf of bread which is a stomach stuffer, and the thing that did me in was that they drowned every level of the sandwich (if you can categorize it as a sandwich) with the hottest sauce they had. After the 5th bite, my sinuses were already out of the race. It was fun trying though. I did it at the same time as a friend. We both got to the same point and agreed they could have given us 2 hours and we still would have failed. Waitress was very cool, so were the managers who came out to hang with us while we tried. Would definitely recommend this place.",

I came here with a group from work and we were seated outside at the only complete shaded table on the side of the building. Loved the table. There were even barely moving ceiing fans above that did nothing to keep you cool in the heat.  We started with two orders of fried pickles which took forever to come out. In past visits, they usually came out immediately event when you were busy.  I also remember these as being crispy and spicy but they were soggy and most of the coating was falling off. Not a good start to this lunch.  For a meal, I ordered the beer can chicken with onion rings and mac n cheese.  The chicken was smoked well but was also quite fatty. I remember the mac n cheese being really good but what i received was cafeteria quality with overcooked pasta and flavorless cheese. The onion rings were a bit too crispy.  I'm not sure what happened Mac's. Your food just isn't as good as it used to be. The best thing about this visit was our server but even she couldn't save this from being a 2-star review.",

They even had a guy from a local brewery giving out samples of bourbon aged beer.   As for the food, the Tabasco fried pickles are about the best I've had anywhere. They've got a spicy flavor without being too heavily breaded. The pickle chips were thin and weren't greasy at all, in fact we ended up ordering a second basket. As great as the pickles were, they beef rib was even better. The beef rib took up most of my plate and was something out of the old Flintstones cartoon. This thing was tender, well cooked, and I could barely finish all of it (and I was starving.) The green bean casserole and BBQ beans were both excellent as well but I was too full to eat too much of them.The Texas toast is pretty good as well but I was too stuffed to eat much of it. The sweet tea was worthy of ordering as well.   This place is a must try in Charlotte and I'll be back here if I'm back in town.",

Usually they are just quick and efficient lacking personality. The nachos and wings are perfect starters. The hush puppies are great but they stop coming with the butter which I miss, it was a hit. I've tried just about everything and have no complaints. Make sure you get your points for beer. I typically like to order to go food while I enjoy a beer at the bar just for the experience. My to go order is always on point and they never miss a beat.",

Macaroni and cheese tasted more like overcooked butter noodles I think they forgot the cheese. Hush puppies were amazing I would highly recommend! Cocktails were weak, I like to know there alcohol in my drink especially when I'm paying $8 a glass for the tiniest mason jar basically full of ice with a splash of mixer. The coleslaw was good the portions were huge we definitely had a ridiculous amount of left overs to take home. Staff was nice but next time I'm in the area I don't think I'll be rushing back.",

Everything from the BBQ sauce, to the tiny hint of spicy in the green bean casserole, to the loaded baked potato type potato salad was incredible. My boyfriend got the beef rib and it was fall apart in your mouth delicious. He got collard greens and mac & cheese for sides and loved them too. I also got the Mac's Spiked Tea to drink. Not super strong but pretty good for a variation of a Long Island iced tea. The Tabasco fried pickles were the best fried pickles I've had also-not soggy and the breeding didn't fall off which usually happens at other restaurants. We will 100% make the 2.5 hour trip from Augusta, GA and come back to eat here again.",

Service is always friendly and prompt, food always tastes fresh and amazing, even when I order take out. The St. Louis style ribs are my personal favorite menu item. The only suggestion I'd make is if your dining in, order your appetizer first then order your meal when it comes out, because their kitchen is fast, but that's a good thing! I personally just like to enjoy my appetizer for a little bit before my meal. All in all I've never been let down. Check this place out!",

    "text": "We took my coworker here for his birthday because he'd been raving about how much he loved this place. And maybe it's another one of those \"wrong time...wrong day\" experiences but this place just didn't do it for me.  We arrived a little after 11am and the place was already starting to get busy. For me that's always a great sign!  We were seated in a booth by the outside patio and here's the first major downside...there were flies everywhere. I guess since the door kept being opened and it was so hot this was to be expected but it's nothing I hate more than eating inside and having to swat and cover my food.   Our waitress came over and greeted us and my coworkers and I are still trying to figure out if she was \"new\" or just completely \"lost\" but service was horrible. Our drinks weren't refilled, there were a couple of orders came out wrong and the process of paying was a real disaster. I won't bore you with the details just know I was not impressed at all.   But on to the food, I ordered the Lil' pig (pork BBQ sandwich) and macaroni and cheese. The BBQ was just okay. It just wasn't anything special. I did enjoy trying all the different sauces on the table. The slaw was meh. But I'm not really a slaw lover. The real downer was the mac and cheese...so bland and tasteless. My coworker said normally it doesn't taste like that so I'm thinking it was just the first batch of the day and they just were rushing and maybe missed some seasoning. Who knows?!  I'll put it like this if my coworkers suggests this place again I'd come back and give them another chance but it's definitely not high on my list.",

    "text": "I feel that Mac's is over-hyped, claiming they are the #1 BBQ joint in Charlotte. I've had better, way better. In fact, my husband and I own a smoker and are avid fans of smoking meats/BBQ, and I would pick his over Mac's any day.   My husband and I got a to-go order last night. Maybe this was the mistake! He had a small sampler platter: ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and brisket with mac-n-cheese and baked beans. I had the brisket quesadilla. I will commend the hostess staff as they grabbed a waitress to get the food from the bar for me. I couldn't leave the front door area as I was parked in a handicap spot (no to-go parking and the lot was slammed), and I was swinging through after a pedicure.   I wish I would have taken pictures of the food, especially his. It was not appetizing at all. Everything looked burnt! And when you opened the box, the strong smell and heat of smoke came flying out. I had bites of everything so I can vouch for his opinions on the food: the ribs were tough and did not fall off the bone, the pulled pork was good (as usual), the sausage was almost black and so dry it tasted like beef jerky, the brisket looked like a McRib strip, and was dry and over-smoked, and the mac-n-cheese was pretty good. *We didn't eat the baked beans.* Overall, most of his meat was dry, over-smoked, burnt, and chewy (like it had been smoked 2 days before and then re-heated on a super-hot grill or in the microwave).  Onto my dinner: mine was definitely much better than his. The brisket was juicy in mine, and came with onions, pepper jack cheese, and jalapenos. I added their signature BBQ sauce (vinegar based) for a kick. It was a good quesadilla with good flavors.  We've had much better experiences at other BBQ joints, for less cost. If we would have dined-in, we definitely would have sent the food back and informed the manager. I highly doubt we will be back.",

With the Chainsaw's BBQ sandwich you can choose from a list of toppings, it's basically like creating your own sandwich.

The outdoor dining area is right next to the smoking area so you need to watch where they sit you.    My wife ordered the brisket sandwich- Sandwich, which is open faced, arrived with 2 small slices of brisket on top of limp Texas toast with sauteed onions on the side.  Brisket was tough and chewy.  In the past the sandwich would come loaded with meat and smothered with onions and bbq sauce.   I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs.  The menu says that they are st;. Louis ribs so they should have been big and meaty. What arrived was baby back ribs.  good smoky flavor but a litlle chewy.  My sides were onion rings and slaw.  The onions ring breading was spicy which wasn't bad but there was way too much breading.  So all that you tasted was the breading.   I doubt I will be back to Macs anytime soon with so many cue options in town.",

The other item I've had a few times that I do like is the beer can chicken, which I think is pretty moist typically and has a good flavor.

Service can be hit or miss, but this is not a place that you come for \"great service\" - it's just a fun, relaxed place to go for a beer and a quick bite...and if you're into sports, its a good spot to watch a game with a lively crowd.",

Had a little pig sammy, a bud light tall boy (which I didn't drink but felt compelled to order it b/c everyone else at the restaurant had one and I'm a loser and succumbed to bandwagon peer pressure), and seriously the best hush-puppies ever! Being from SF, where there are no hush-puppies, I didn't quite get why it came with a side of whipped butter... what, you need to add more fat to deep fried cornmeal balls?!... but my local coworkers told me to shut my trap and just try them. I happily obliged and now am fatter b/c of it. (It was well worth it.) No wonder this place gets packed, especially at lunchtime. Atmosphere is kinda like a l'air du country-barn-rodeo genre; really don't get why they tout this as a biker bar, as it was neither bad-ass nor Harley-ish; nor did I even see bikes in the parking lot for that matter.   I wonder if it's on purpose that all the servers are PYT girls in their 20s... eh, who cares, pass me some h-pups, those are my eye candy!",

I had the beer can chicken with the chipotle wing sauce.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The mac and cheese is great as well.  The second time I went there I ordered the same thing, including the collard greens.  The chicken was dry and lacked flavor.  The collard greens are a bit juicy for my taste.  Seemed there was a lot of water in the bowl.  The mac and cheese was consistent.  The third time I went there I tried the wings.  These were ok.  They did not seem to have much flavor from the chipotle wing sauce.  Maybe they did not have enough sauce on them.  They were not anything to brag about.  What I can say is that this place is inconsistent with the food.  Sometimes the meal is great and sometimes it is less than good.  I visited more than twice because of co-workers wanting to eat there.  I will never make the decision to go there again.",

    "text": "It was recommended by a co-worker of mine to try this place out since I was craving BBQ for lunch. I was pleasantly impressed! Most BBQ places around here that I've been to were just Carolina style BBQ (which I'm not a huge fan of), but this place wasn't limited to just that, very nice selection.  I got there at around 12:45pm (since it was recommended not to go right at noon) and I was a little intimidated by the amount of people there. I wasn't going for a dine in kind of meal, but it was nice to see the take out menu at the hostess stand. Honestly, it took me longer to figure out what I wanted to eat than waiting on my food. I was instructed to go to the bar to order my to go meal and the time it took me to figure out a tip and sign my bill, my food was out!  Side note: because I was on my lunch break, I didn't drink but this is def. a place I want to check out for after work drinks. I liked the  bar (was the longest bar I've seen in a long time in a restaurant), it was clean (not like those sticky nasty bars that you have to take a shower if you put your arm on it), and the bar tender that was there was really nice.   The food: AWESOME!! I haven't had BBQ this good since I moved up to the Charlotte area from Orlando. I ordered the Texas Beef Brisket sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. Normally I would go for pulled pork but I saw somebody else eating the same thing and thought it was worth a try. I was expecting the beef to be tough like jerky but I didn't even have to \"saw\" through the meat when taking a bite, it just separated so nice! The flavor was fantastic, not smothered in BBQ sauce to where you couldn't taste the meat. It's been a long time since i've had BBQ like that, where you can taste the meat you ordered instead of just the BBQ sauce! The mac n cheese, DREAMY! It wasn't greasy and it had a nice blend of cheese and pepper. So great!  The only down fall is their parking lot is really small and from what I hear (not just on yelp), it stays crowded.",

Good beer selection and they always have a daily drink special. You get you food fast if you want it, some plates might need more time but what I order is usually ready asap. They just changed the menu and the new burgers are awesome. The staff works hard and remembers most of the patrons, they are tight knit here. Live bands on Saturdays outside with no cover charge. Great location in South Charlotte. The food is very consistant what you get one time is much like the next time.   Con's: Prices went up and have gone up steadily over the years, could be economic reasons not sure. The parking lot can get full very quickly but that is a sign of popularity so I deal with it.",

    "text": "I will preface this by conceding that I am a 37 year old, old fart.  I like easy parking, no ridiculously loud music (unless it's the weekend and 10 pm, then there should be loud music) and comfortable seating choices.  If you fail on any of these requirements, I will not return.  Me and a group of friends were Thursday night regulars for after work drinks for a while until biker summer started with the live bands and blocking off most of the lot parking for motorcycles.  (It's an alleged biker bar, so I get that, they get the summer, no big, plenty of places around to drink).  We could generally slip out of work early and find a parking spot actually in the lot, which was nice. There is motorcycle parking, but there are always cars parked there instead - RUDE. The other parking alternative was a street on an adjacent lot, or parking across Sandy Porter at the shopping center and crossing over multiple lanes of traffic.  The side street is now a dirt pile of construction, which leaves your only option, if you can't find a spot in the lot, as the shopping center across the street.    The service has never been bad, just inconsistent.  Some nights we would have a great waitress, other times we would be sitting with empty glasses, and it didn't seem to jive with how busy they were, just very hit and miss.  Again, no biggie, we're there to snack, drink and eat, no one was on a time schedule.    The food has generally been decent.  The fried pickles are a little on the spicy side, but pretty good and served with ranch.  The hushpuppies with a little butter smeared on them are good.  Chili Nachos are standard bar nachos, nothing special but solid.  Being with a group of southern people generally, we had to try the Pimento cheese but found it to be not very good the night we ordered it and the tortilla chips were inedible from being over-salted.  I ordered the chopper salad once, that was a mistake. The collard greens are a little too spicy for my taste, but not bad.  The mac and cheese would be delicious on one visit and dry and meh the next.  Good choices of beer and beer specials.  On vodka nights, my drinks were always mixed well.  But this is a BBQ place, so as long as the BBQ is good, that is all that matters, RIGHT?!?!  And the BBQ is quite good.  I had the pulled pork which was very good and the Beef Brisket which was absolutely delicious.  The beef brisket is so good, it almost makes the ridiculous parking and the bar stools worth the hassle.  Almost.  Last Friday the girls wanted to go for dinner and drinks.  Being a Friday, I was ready to get out of work and get on with the weekend!  I received a text when I was on my way that the parking lot was already full (&%^$), but at least I can park on the street next to it.  I arrived only to see dirt everywhere and no street so I would have to park in the shopping center across Sandy Porter.  All of the relatively close spaces were taken (double-&%^$).  So now I get to play Frogger in an ankle length skirt and slip on shoes to get across the street to Mac's (triple-&%^$).  I managed to get across the street without getting squished or losing a shoe, increasingly agitated, but looking forward to some brisket, only to find that the rest of my party had perched their tiny hineys on wooden bar stools (there are chairs and wooden booths also, but the majority of the inside seating is high bar stools, with large picnic tables as the outdoor seating options).  (I am not a small chick and me on a wooden bar stool looks like a lumpy popsicle trying to eat it's stick).  I decided then and there that my only biker experience for the night would be Sons of Anarchy on Netflix and I hopped back across Sandy Porter and got out of there.  I should have gotten a to-go brisket, but was too annoyed to think of the goodness.    They are doing something right because it seems to always be packed during peak hours, so if you are young enough to not mind parking issues and uncomfortable seating, head on over and get some yum BBQ.",

It has been a lot of little things as of late. Cold meats and sides, really dry brisket and pork, literally no cheese on the mac and cheese. The other locations have gotten worse as well but the sandy porter location has gotten the worse. The beer list is always pretty good though and the prices are great.

Pork is spotty and sometimes dry, but a little sauce can help out immensely. Ribs are always good though and blackened catfish tacos are pretty decent for un fried tacos. (Can you sense the fish taco purist in me?)   While I like different BBQ joints depending on my mood, one thing that never changes is my perpetual, unconditional love for Mac's sides. Mac and cheese is always good and the green been casserole, oh man. Thanksgiving on a Monday! Yeeeah!",

The only thing I didn't like was the live music - it was absolutely terrible. If people want live music, they'll go to a bar or concert - mainly not a restaurant/sports bar when college football is on.",

While I was set on exploring a local brewery we ended up here, and luckily they had a massive beer list with a number of local beers many of which were available on draft.  Beer selection is the real highlight of Mac's however after sitting and socializing over work for a bit, we decided it was time to grab a bite to eat. I decided to go with the Carolina Beef Brisket, which is 9 oz. of your choice of lean, fatty or both, dry rubbed & slow smoked for 12 hours & finished on the grill with our Western NC BBQ sauce, served with caramelized onions. I wasn't given the choice of what type of cut I preferred and received a lean thick cut which after being grilled again it seemed dried out and really lacked any flavor, luckily the bbq sauce helped a bit. Personally, I could have gone without the brisket being grilled and cooked again. I probably should have just went with a burger instead.  The atmosphere here is more of a dive sports bar, however, it was a pretty relaxed vibe with plenty of TVs to catch your favorite game. Prices were reasonable, and the staff was friendly however I am not sure I would return for the food.",

Two: my salad is always big, full of goodies and comes out fast. No complaints.  Three: Banana pudding was probably the worst I've ever had and I love almost anything.

I'm very particular about having the cheese well spread out and melted on all of the chips and everything was just kind of dumped in the middle. It still tasted good and I made it work by filling the empty outer chips into the middle, but I thought they could have done a better job. Nachos are easy!   The pulled pork was very good. Macs has great sauces to put on their barbecue but honestly it is very flavorful and doesn't really need it. The baked potato salad was delicious and the mac n cheese was pretty nice also.   Overall, we had quick service and decent food. I wasn't wowed, but Mac's is always a good staple.",

We planned it perfect and arrived right after the Panthers game finished.  They had some drink specials such as $1 off NC pints and $5 bloody Mary's and mimosas.  I ordered pulled pork with Mac and cheese and collards.  The sides were hot and on point!  My pork although was not hot at all.  I was not happy with that unfortunately but it was still good.

I like that they have 4-6 different sauces on the table so that you can pick whichever you like best. I usually get their pulled pork sandwich/plate or the pulled turkey plate. Both are pretty good. My favorite sides are the mac and cheese and green bean casserole. You also get free hush puppies as an appetizer, but you have to ask for them. Parking is kind of a pain. The lot is pretty small and almost always full. I've had to park across the street and risk getting a ticket",

Mac's has a large craft beer selection, both on draft and in bottles. They had a Wicked Weed Gluten free double IPA on draft that was very good. They have a full bar for those that don't like beer. The atmosphere inside is a lot like Hickory Tavern with some high top tables, and regular tables, a good many TV's with sports running. The service was fast and friendly. They have a large outdoor seating area that tends to be well used. I've not tried that yet. Overall, a great place to come have some BBQ, drink a beer, and watch a game.",

Bbq beans were tasty and the pulled pork was tender.  $4 for a 25 oz beer was a nice surprise.   Hubby really enjoyed his side of chili with all the fixings.  We would definitely come back.  Just a little noisy & lots of families with small children. Not a biker place....",

They were good but I was expecting crunchy, these had no crunch & the batter taste like it should go on chicken tenders rather than an onion. The Blue Burger over all is a good burger but if you are expecting it to be full of blue cheese flavor this is not the burger to get. Another downside to the burger is they forgot the bacon. Mac n cheese, green bean casserole, & coleslaw were all delicious! The decor is really cool & the staff is nice.",

We ordered from the Steele Creek location, but the only other time I went was to the Lake Norman location.  I can't speak for service this time as someone else ordered and picked up our food.  I ordered pork bbq, it was pretty good as was the sauce that it came with. The sides were definitely blah.  Potato Salad - some of the worst I have had, just does not have a flavor kick to it at all.  Side Salad - shredded lettuce with a bunch of bacon bits and tomatoes - blah.  Had a bite of someone else's macaroni and cheese, very bland, did not care for it.  With other much better bbq options out there, I don't see myself returning on my own dime.",

Everything is overpriced and now not worth it. It's too dark inside to read the menu and the design of the menu does not make well for the lighting. This is the first clue no one is paying attention to the details. The Fired Pickles were greasy and that meant they fell apart. For 1 order of pickles they give you a small side of ranch dressing. Should come with more. My BBQ Sam'ich looked like they had dipped it in the deep fat fryier before it came out. It was covered in grease. The theme now seems to be everything with a side of grease. I get it, it's not health food but BBQ should have some fat on it but not tons of grease. It was not edible. The sweet tea was good but that was about it.",

I had been very disappointed with the food in the last year, we decided to come have our traditional New Years fare to watch football and enjoy great beer. I'm absolutely ecstatic to say the food is back to superb. The pulled pork was the best thing I've ever put into my mouth, I'm from a big barbq town so that says a lot, the greens have been upgraded (if that's possible)and the black-eyed peas were spot on. I'm so excited that we can once again enjoy this great establishment for more than great wings and beer selection. Matty is AMAZING thank you for whatever you've done to make this our favorite place again. Yay!  Everyone needs to go now!",

He had for sides coleslaw and Brunswick stew neither of which were good. They listed Texas Toast comes with the meal but it was plain old white bread thin and smashed even thinner. My choice was a pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was flavorless. The pulled pork was cold and had inedible chunks of gristle. I had to spit it out it was so awful. The beer we had tasted like they were served in diety glasses. Just gross all around. The wait staff consists of pretty skanky chics. Not a great place and we won't be back, ever!",

    "text": "If you come on the right day, Mac's has pretty good food.  However, this location has a pretty big problem with consistency.  Some nights here the food is fresh and delicious, but other nights the food is quite bad and tastes like it's been re-heated.  It's a real shame that this is such a problem because it's close to me but I don't know if I want to go back to this location.  Their mac-n-cheese, onion rings, collar greens, and pulled pork are my favorite things on the menu.  I love that they bring you hushpuppies for the table, because when they are fresh, they are crisp on the outside, soft and middle, and not dried out.  Their brisket is pretty tasty on the right night as well.  Unfortunately, we tried to order burgers one night and they were overly charred on the outside but still medium rare on the inside.  I couldn't get over the char taste.  I'm not sure if this is normal, as this was definitely one of their bad night.  I would also skip their sweet potato fries.  They were definitely not very crispy and were very under-seasoned.    If you just want to grab a drink with friends, they have a good selection of beers and daily beer specials.  They have some regional and national microbrews on tap, with plenty of interesting and unique beers besides just IPAs, and a pretty large bottle selection.  Service is generally good, especially if you are drinking.  This place is almost always fairly crowded and the parking lot is small, so it's a bit crazy here at times.  They have loud music sometimes and the restaurant inside is small, so it's a bit off-putting if you plan to come for a quiet dinner.  The tables are crowded and when it's busy you may have to sit on an uncomfortable stool at a high-top table.    Overall, Mac's has a few quirks that makes it hard to love. But when it's a good day, Mac's has some pretty good grub.",

The ranch is definitely house made, you can taste the sour cream! I had the small sandwich with onion rings that were so good I didn't want to share them. Whoops.

Finding parking might be tricky, people sometimes resort to parking across the street. However there will be plenty of seating inside and outside!   Got the pork belly appetizer and small combo platter to share between me and my boyfriend. The pork belly was good, first smoked pork belly I've had and I really liked the flavor! I didn't get much blueberry from it, which was the flavor of the sauce, but I still liked the sauce it came with. For the combo plate we got brisket, chicken, pulled pork, and ribs. My favorites were the brisket and ribs. The pulled pork was great as well, the chicken was a little lacking in flavor. Everything was pretty tender. I wish we could have gotten a little more of the pulled pork and brisket rather than a giant leg from the chicken but the platter was pretty cheap so it's not a big deal.   They also had four special sauces, a mustard one, a vinegar one, and two bbq ones. My favorite were the two bbq ones which I mixed together on my plate.   Overall probably the cheapest bbq I've had in Charlotte. The pork belly was $8 and the platter was $20. We could have done without the pork belly, especially since the serving size was pretty small. We were full off of just the platter. Service was fast, our actual waitress didn't come around a whole lot but they had like four guys who worked the bbq I guess walking around too and we just flagged them down. They also had a great drinks menu that looked interesting!",

We again ordered some food - Big Pig with mac n cheese.  Never disappointed.  Great food here.   This place is great.  Awesome specials, don't forget $3 pints on Mondays and they have a wide variety of craft beer.  So WIN WIN! I believe, based on appearances, Wednesday is their pint takeover. Come by, buy a pint featured and most likely get a pint glass.  We are 3 for 3! White Street, Devils Backbone and Starr Hill.   Overall, wonderful atmosphere, great service, pretty good food and awesome selection of craft brews.  They have daily specials, so make sure to check them out online.    Cheers",

The wings were great and loved the NC Sauce. Chips and salsa with pimento cheese were okay, and the cheese grits were good too. Tried the Carolina Stew and that was forgettable (tasted like canned minestrone soup). The terrible brisket (3 small slices for $18) just ruined the entire meal. Shame on you, Mac's. I can't believe you would even plate it for a customer and consider it edible.",

They are open until 2am which is great when you're out late. The staff is always friendly. They have and VERY large beer menu and offer a rewards program which is nice. Their apple bread pudding is AMAZING and worth a visit just to try it.",

Even though we arrived at 11:40 a.m. our request for table seating was denied since it was just two of us.     Arghhh.  Our wings were good as was the green bean casserole (that recipe is worth stealing); however, the mac-n-cheese and onion rings were duds lacking depth of flavor and love.  Skimpy and wimpy.  I'm going to nit-pik, but I hate the aluminum serving trays and containers.  It reminds me of  feeding our dogs when I was kid--everytime.  I just cannot escape the look and feel.  As soon as my food is plopped down I want to whistle and say, \"Barney and Dutchess, time to eat.\"  3 stars for decent smoky wings, but the hard-ass stools, mediocre sides, and the dog trays whisper just loudly enough \"keep searching.\"",

Great place for late night eats, when most places were closed, Macs was open and because of that I've been here twice in one week due to convenient late night hours! I have had a few drink options as well, they do a good Moscow mule and a great version of a long island tea. A great go to that is not too expensive but tastes good. Lots of TV's to watch the games...outdoor seating available and even live music on select nights. Great atmosphere for family and groups of friends.

This hunk of meat on a bone is so soft and tender, I wonder how they get it on the plate without falling apart. And at last it hits your mouth and the taste is like frolicking thru a field of flowers on  a nice spring afternoon (lol, maybe just a bit dramatic).

So I go in and go to the bar and sit  because I was just going to get it to go and eat it in my office. I sit at the bar for a good ten minutes and watch two servers walk past me back and forth one of the young ladies is setting up glasses and just is going about her business. So pretty much I got tired of waiting to be acknowledged and got up and left. This isn't the first time this has happened within the past week. I went thursday prior to today to  grab something and ended up waiting for like 10 minutes to be acknowledged and I was just coming to grab a beer and get my to go order. Finally the young lady asks me and I tell her im here for a to go order and would like to grab a beer while I wait. She proceeds to ask if I would like a glass for my beer and I tell her yes. She then proceeds to slide me a glass and can of beer and walks away. I HAD TO POUR MY OWN FRICKING BEER. LIKE WHAT IN THE WORLD.",

The pieces served to me were about 1x1.5x4 inches, grey on the inside no moisture and definitely NO smoke ring. Complained to manager who told me that's the they served it for 10 years. So if your looking for Lockhart Texas style brisket run from this place and order online from Kruez Market.

As far as food, pretty much the same Macs you'd expect, although my lil pig pork sandwich didn't seem all that warm when it was served.   i misread one of the chalkboards thinking there was a draft special of some sort, but much to my surprise the draft beer i ordered cost nearly as much as my sandwich. Honestly, as much as i love beer, and i am a borderline alcoholic, i would never pay that much for a single beer. $7.50 for a beer? i did enjoy the beer, but that's besides the point. No beer is worth that much to me on a Tuesday night when i could get plenty of good beer at Duckworth's for $2.50.  i guess i'll just have to check the price for my beer-budget conscious self next time before ordering.

We started with the hush puppies served with some type of butter sauce and the fried pickles - both were incredible.  I had the grilled chicken BBQ sandwich - which they allow you to pick from about 20 different additions to the sandwich with no additional cost, which really impressed me.  Everyone at the table was very satisfied with the food/service and we would definitely recommend it to anyone around the Ayrsley area of Charlotte. Check out Mac's!",

We'll seasoned and absolutely delicious. ...yummy Mac & Cheese and pulled pork. The ribs were tasty and fell off the bone.  I did have a spoonful of the bake beans but they were too sweet for me but still pretty good. I would be eating here again and the price is right.",

    "text": "Somehow I have lived in Charlotte for almost 6 months and just realized that Mac's is less than 10 minutes from my house.    We visited Mac's on a Thursday evening and were intimidated by all the cars in the parking lot when we pulled in. We almost changed our minds.  I was expecting a wait, but we were seated right away and there were other empty tables.  I think the crowd on the patio accounted for a lot of the cars.  Overall, our experience was great.  Good service and the food came super quick (as it should in bbq place).  We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer.  I somehow neglected to read the part about spicy in the menu.  They aren't kidding!  They have a kick.  Don't really care for spicy food, but they were good - and I was warned after all.  Homemade ranch was tasty.  Hubs ordered the half smoked chicken and it was perfection.  So awesome.  Beans and fries were tasty sides.  I ordered a veggie plate with green bean casserole, super awesome mac n cheese and onion rings.  I found the onion rings too spicy - wondering if I missed that warning too - but hubs liked them.  Everything was just super tasty and the mac n cheese is totally craveable!  I had plenty of plate envy watching the food being delivered around me.  We will be back.  If I have to have a gripe, it would be that our waitress sat down on the booth beside me to take our order and I saw her doing this with other patrons as well.  Maybe I'm weird, but I hate it when waitpersons do this.  Maybe if I've been eating here for years - maybe - maybe - but not with someone you don't know.",

Love the beer selection, I mean, they have shit that you can't really get many other places in town. Overall, Mac's is a good choice. This one though... definitely doesn't feel like a biker bar.  On the day we went, the second we walked in we were nearly deafened by the crappy cover band they had playing inside the damned thing. I mean... the place inside just isn't built to accommodate a full blown, totally plugged in, loud as hell, local bar, cover band. We had a really hard time hearing each other and to scream over the music even though we sat as far away as possible from them. This was juts a poor booking decision.  Our server was really nice and helpful. She came around fairly often to check on us and offer more beer (always a plus). The food came out fast and hot and everything was great. Ordered the BBQ plate (with Eastern Carolina BBQ, the only way to eat BBQ) with onion rings and the green bean casserole. The green been casserole was odd, It was good, but it tasted and had a nice heat to it, like Jalapeno peppers had been used. Took some getting used to... still not sure if I liked it.  Everything else was great.",

    "text": "When I first moved to Charlotte, I just heard that Mac's Speed Shop was the place to go to BBQ and went to the one on South Blvd since that was the first one to show up on my search.  Little did I realize there was a Mac's right by where I live here in Steele Creek!  The first thing my husband and I said was, \"Oh NO!  We are going to get so fat!!\"  I absolutely LOVE Mac's and everything about it.  The food, of course, comes first and is spot on with reasonable prices, big portions and tons of flavor.  I'm a sucker for cheese & grits and theirs is awesome.  Last time I was there, my husband and I split the combo platter to get a little bit of everything and we were so happy we did.  The server also recommended we try their banana pudding, and though we were skeptical, our bowl was empty by the time the check came.  The service here is always really friendly and attentive which I can appreciate even when they are busy and have a lot of customers.  They also have drink specials every night, even on the weekends, which is another nice incentive to spend your money here than elsewhere.  This is definitely going to be our go-to spot for our BBQ cravings and so glad we found one so close to home!",

I will NOT eat anything perpared here.  I have gotten sick one too many times along with other people dining in the same group.

Also got the $3 \"mystery beer\" which was an interesting concept.  For $3, they pull off a random bottle beer.  Was happy with the result, so that was good.

Things I love are the 'pork wing' (trust me), veggie burger, brisket, and pulled pork (go ahead and go for the BIG pig sandwich if you're debating).  Their totally addictive side items are awesome. Onion rings, green bean casserole, mac n cheese, Brunswick stew...all so good.   And, the full bar including great specials and lots of local brew is great.  Goes well with the boisterous rock n roll atmosphere often well attended by the motorized biker crowd.  Be on a black leather lookout at Mac's!",

Especially with the word \" speed\" in the name Wow, was I wrong  The day was beautiful so we sat out on the patio at one of the covered picnic tables. Our server came and got our drinks very promptly. We had two dogs and they were welcomed with water ,too Real smoke and slow cooked food here. Lots of selections. Several opted for the pulled pork on a salad. Great choice! The salad was fresh , good dressing and wonderful pulled pork. There was enough for a second meal Ribs were wonderful,too. Meaty, Basted in sauce and fall off the bone tender. This also lasted two meals Wonderful experience. Casual atmosphere, good service and good food.  A real winner. Good enough to bring out of town guests",

Those happen occasionally.    Subsequent visits have me this:  Nothing at this location is consistent. One time you might get exceptionally prepared food, but crappy service. And the next time you might get average food and excellent service. You just never know. Maybe that's part of their charm?",

We ordered shrimp tacoS, but only received one. While it's an appetizer, it's not represented as a serving of one taco on the website menu. Additionally, the order was checked before it was handed to us, only for us to discover that the order was incorrect when we got home. We had to return to the restaurant to pick up the missing pork belly.  The staff was nice, but they didn't seem particularly apologetic or attempt to make amends for the fact that we had to come back for the missed item that had been paid for. It would have been nice to have them offer a coupon, discount, or complimentary item.   The food overall wasn't fantastic (pork was dry and the taco was very runny) and I probably wouldn't return to dine in or carryout.",

Usually staff is very nice, friendly etc.. this time I found the bartender to be short and not very happy that I sat at her bar. It was pretty obvious that she was more interested in the men sitting at her bar. I had to wait longer for service and could tell I was putting her out by asking for anything. I thought it may have just been me but when another female sat down 2 seats away from me, she received the same cold shoulder.  It wont stop me from eating here in the future,  I will just be sure to stay away from the bar if she is working.",

The reason for this review is the sub-par customer service I received while at this location. This is the second occurrence of poor service there, however much worse the second time around.  I sat myself at the bar because being a single person I didn't want to hold up a table during the lunch rush crowd. There was 5 people at the bar when I sat down. I waited for a long time before finally being asked what I would like. After placing my order I quickly received my drink and shortly after received my food (which was brought out from the back by a food runner I assume).   With my drink gone and my hands covered in sauce, I had nothing to wipe my hands on. Never did the bar tender come by to see if my order was correct or if I needed anything. She instead stood at the end talking to two customers at the bar. I was able to finish my meal and drink...with enough time to use the wax paper from my basket to clean my fingers enough to send a message via Facebook to the Steele Creek location.   Then all of a sudden Robert the manager appeared and asked me how my service was. I explained the issues I had and he in turn offered to buy me a beer. However, being tight on time and patience I couldn't allow myself to stay any longer.   What really bothered me was that after everything I got an apology from the manager but nothing taken off my bill and the bar tender never said a word.  With a place this popular I would have hoped for better service and better treatment.   I wouldn't waste my time going there if you plan on sitting at the bar, get a table and hopefully your experience will be better than mine.",

BBQ Brisket with cheddar grits, greens and Texas toast was delicious, onion rings were crisp and spicy, BBQ chicken was a very big portion but disappeared quickly as it was succulent and tasty. For dessert we got Banana Pudding which was amazing (not quite in my grandmas level, but close) and the Bourbon Pecan pie which also didn't last long in the table. It was a good place for kids as the outside deck is a good place to run around for a little if they get restless. Our server was attentive and very accommodating for us as well.

Not at all because of the food, because it was EXCELLENT but the restaurant/bar/whatever it is, was SO LOUD I couldn't hear my friend chatting across the table.  Maybe it's not always like that, but last night it was very noisy!    Our waitress was great - attentive and very helpful, never had an empty glass.  We ordered the fried pickle appetizer, which was okay, probably good, but I'm not a huge dill pickle fan in any case.  We both ordered the \"A Little Bit o' Stuff\" platter, which was anything but little and I barely made a dent in the food and took a whole container of food home for leftovers!  For $16 it's a great deal - choice of four meats and two sides...I had chicken, bbq, brisket and ribs with mac and cheese (all you've read about this mac and cheese is True, it was AMAZING) and a side salad.  He had the same meat choices with green bean casserole instead of salad.  Everything was tender and delicious and I loved it!  I took the 5th star simply because of the volume of noise....between the live band and the chatter - it was super distracting.  I would probably give the outside seating area a try next time...or just go for take out.    Food - Great    Service - Great ....check it out if you haven't!",

    "text": "Forget poor service, how about NO SERVICE.  It was a Friday night back in January and a friend and I happened to be in the area and found that there was a Mac's Speed Shop location in Steele Creek. We decided to go there based off the reputation of the one located on South Blvd.  Little did I know that I was in for the poorest customer experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  We get there around 9:30 PM and the hostess quickly seats us.  After about 15 minutes of sitting no server has come to our table yet so we grab one of the many servers walking around and ask for a server.  She told us that our server was busy in the back cleaning and would be out soon but in the meantime she would take our orders for drinks.  We ordered a couple of waters and Long Island Iced Teas.  She did bring the waters out quickly.  About 20-25 more minutes pass and no drinks, and no server returns to actually take our orders for food.  So at this point we've been here for a good 40+ minutes with no server.  I look around and notice that many of the girls working there were just standing around doing nothing.  Some of them even had the audacity to look towards our table but not have the initiative to provide any service or do their job.  Not sure who manages this place but it was very poorly run that night.  Some of the other patrons were actually being served too so I'm not certain if there's some familiarity thing going on or whether the staff was just outright lazy.  Whatever the case, we decided to just get up and leave rather than create a scene.  Whoever was in charge of the staff here certainly needs to either clean house on the poor staff or change his/her own management style.  I've never had such an awkward and terrible experience in a restaurant before.  It goes without saying that we won't be back and won't recommend this location to anyone else.  It's sad because based on the South Blvd location, I can say that Mac's actually does have good food.  If you want to try Mac's Speed Shop then head to the South Blvd location.  Don't waste your time in this one with the absolutely clueless staff and their total lack of professionalism.  Avoid.",

Nothin was great. The burger was burnt tasting and super greasy. The Mac and cheese is ok. The pulled pork is good but don't like any of their BBQ sauces. They don't have a normal sauce.. All vinegar or mustard based. Brunswick stew is super spicy but doesn't say that on the menu. Was so hot I couldn't eat. Fried pickles are super salty. The only good thing I have had is onion rings and a wide selection of beers. Wish they were better being I live close.. Bummer",

Glad to hear that the management at the Steele Creek location is too busy for its customers... too busy to right a wrong.",

Turning the attention to the food... the meats are very good. They are slow cooked. I usually eat the pulled pork platter with two sides. Sometimes I will eat the beef brisket. The sauces for the meats add a nice flavor. The selection of side dishes is nice. And they do run out of some of the sides each day. Such as the mac n cheese.  Mac's has the element of being a biker bar/restaurant. At the location on Sandy Porter, I've never seen bikers. The location on South Blvd. attracts the bikers. I like the loud atmosphere and look of the restaurant on the inside with lots of wood and bolts. If you are into rock music, good BBQ, and beer, Mac's is the place to visit.",

Now being a seasoned vet in the restaurant industry, apparently this location has failed to uphold the quality control and customer service that I have experienced elsewhere.

I was surprised to have hush puppies while we waited for our entrees but that was awesome!  I ordered the pulled pork with mac n cheese and green bean casserole.  I used the vinegar sauce with my BBQ and it had a nice twang acidity to it.  The pork was also juicy.  The mac n cheese was creamy, not overpowering, and the noodles were just right.  The green bean casserole was also very tasty.  It was hot, steamy, rich, and a great way to get me to eat my vegetables.  This visit saved Mac's for me as I will definitely be going back!",

I had the fish tacos, borderline cold and very average (there's a theme going here).

A very busy location just off of Tryon- this Macs has seating inside and outside & makes for a great place to go and enjoy that yummy delicious food.   The outside patio has tables and pick nick tables. For those folks who prefer indoor dinning there's plenty of inside tables.  We came and enjoyed the Hearty Beef Ribs .  This is one of the only restaurants I can find that serves Beef ribs and they did not disappoint.  When we arrived the place was packed inside and the tables outside were filling up .  Though it took a little longer than we realized the manager was walking around making sure we were all taken care of. He did mention that a large group had just ordered a big order of beef ribs and our order might be about a 20 minute wait.   Not realizing until the bill came - the Manager gave us a $20.00 credit for the wait !  Wow !  That was an unexpected bonus!  The service was first rate and the wait staff was very attentive and on point with our drinks .  As usual Macs is a great place to enjoy delicious food and the Steel Creek location rocks !!  Two thumbs way up!!!",

    "text": "Besides my Yelp app, do you know where I often get many of my BEST tips for finding good local joints when I'm traveling - at the car rental counter.  I'll usually ask the desk agent, \"hey, where's the place you like to eat?\"  Or \"Where can I find the best (insert cuisine of choice)?\"  So when I was picking up my rental, I asked, \"Since I'm in North Carolina, where's the best BBQ in Charlotte?\"  Two of the three agents working behind the counter, immediately replied \"Mac's Speed Shop\"  I typically don't eat at chains restaurants, but I'll make an exception when it comes to local eateries that specialize in regional cuisines...and it doesn't get more regional in NC and SC than BBQ.  The folks at the airport recommended the Steele Creek location in Charlotte (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacspeedshop.com%2Flocations&s=4544469c83d25739d724df30c37b60de2e28111211fc8d3c09a3d02cffe03ad5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">macspeedshop.com/locatio...</a>) because they liked the atmosphere better and there's more parking.  There is plenty of outdoor seating on the patio which also gets a nice breeze or opt to sit indoors to escape the oppressive heat + humidity of the NC summer - which is what I chose.  Try and dine during Mac's excellent Happy Hour where all draft beers are $1 off (I recommend some of the local NC brews).  I've never been much of a pulled pork fan, so I ordered the Carolina Beef Brisket platter which comes with 9 oz of lean, fatty or both types of meat (I recommend getting a \"half and half) and two sides.     The brisket is dry rubbed and slow smoked for 12 hours with local hickory wood and served with caramelized onions.  To be honest, I enjoyed the fatty pieces better since I found the lean to be a tad on the dry side, but I did like that the dry rub didn't overpower the natural flavor of the smoke.  And I ALWAYS appreciate a BBQ place that doesn't drown their meat in sauce.  There is a selection of multiple vinegar based sauces, but I recommend just the Mac's original with a close second for their mustard based.  The sauces aren't too tart with the right amount of sweetness.    Sides were also pretty tasty.  I always appreciate when Mac/Cheese is made with real ingredients and not prepared with a box mix.  But I was surprised how much I enjoyed the Brunswick stew.  If you've never had it, Brunswick Stew is a Southern staple and is essentially a tomato based soup.  There is some controversy as to whether VA and GA lay claim to its origins (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBrunswick_stew&s=c2fe49aa17de44cb06e2427e68b70c9eef4dcf26d94f06aa4cbf02c4bb171628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br...</a>).  To me, it doesn't really matter since the Mac's version was chocked full of veggies, meat, and had plenty of spice.    And thanks for providing the deep fried goodness of the complimentary hush puppies.  Not too healthy for my arteries, but then again I'm not eating this stuff everyday, so a once in a while treat is probably okay...  I can see why Mac's is a popular BBQ spot in Charlotte since the service is friendly and prompt and overall, you're getting good value for your dining dollar.    Four well deserved stars.",

I'll prefece this with I'm not a huge fan of BBQ in general, but my overall opinion here was that the BBQ was average, and not of any quality better than what could easily be made at home.   Additionally, the service was a bit lacking. Our server gave us no time to peruse the menus before asking what our order was. When we explained we needed more time she left and then literally came back 2 min later, while we were still reading the menus, and we definitely felt the rush.   All together we had a BBQ platter, BBQ nachos and a smoked chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla was satisfactory, and definitely should be ordered with the guacamole, as the included salsa and sour cream that come complimentary are just not enough(the salsa comes in a super small container, and is really only enough for one slice). I tasted the other dishes, and again they were fine, but nothing that would knock your socks off, and my parents echoed the sentiments.  This seems like a great place for happy hour or watch a football game, to grab a drink and maybe have some appetizers to acvompany, but for a full on meal, I'd go elsewhere.",

I went in dolo, so it was easy to find a seat. The wait staff was attentive, and the pricing wasn't bad. I ordered burnt ends....... and they were the most dry burnt ends i have ever tasted. Honestly, I didnt want to finish them, but hey, i paid for them. Maybe I got a bad batch..... maybe they are always like that.... I dont know. I wont know because I wont order them again. But I will most likely go back there to eat.......... something else. People have told me to try the brisket, but I am a burnt ends fan, so when I saw it on the menu, thats where I was going. I was disappointed. The search for really good burnt ends in Charlotte continues.",

More grease than ingredients, stuffed with big chunks of undercooked peppers and onions with a small serving of brisket. Total lack of seasoning, all I tasted was oil and smoke flavor. Third strike and I'm done, food is trash, but servers are nice and beers are good. (Just wish they would let you know before hand what they have run out of on draft before ordering.)",

Other meat options include beer can chicken and sausage. The brisket was very flavorful and had the perfect fattiness to it and the pulled pork had great smokiness that I loved. Ribs were good but just okay. Definitely coming back for brisket and pulled pork! Both sides were good and I liked that the slaw was not drowning in mayo. I also really enjoyed the complimentary hash puppies as well.  We came at 11 am and the place got really packed by noon so come early if you can.  Overall a great barbeque spot with generous portions and reasonable prices!",

Ordered the burnt ends for an app, they weren't burnt but the dry rub was pretty flavorful. I got the brisket for dinner with Mac and cheese and green bean casserole. Hubby ordered pulled pork with Brunswick stew and baked beans. The Mac and cheese was extremely disappointing - basically just noodles. The green bean casserole was great, actually cheesier than the Mac and cheese.   Tab was $80 before tip so seems a little excessive for two but it was good. Will be coming back.",

It's a fried giant patty of vegetables (the base is some sort of bean) and you can add all the fixin's your little (clogged) heart desires with no extra charge. Yup, you can get several diff cheeses, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, coleslaw, onion rings, and avocado to make a giant knife-and-fork veggie burger. That is avocawesome.   Add a nice local, cold brew and you've got yourself one hearty lunch..plus some.

Portions were very nice for the price.  Especially the pork and turkey.   The brisket was ok. Nothing to write home about.   The ribs were fantastic. Nice pull. Great flavor.   The 4 sauces offered were very good although it would have been nice if they offered a sweet sauce.  All in all however the good was plentiful and had a great flavor.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Her casual style fit right in with the atmosphere of this BBQ joint.

We got the combo with pork, brisket, beef sausage and ribs. We packed up half for dinner and started in on the rest.   The pork was great (hard to mess that up), but the brisket won the afternoon. It was super tender and smokey! The flavor of everything was so good that we didn't even break into the 6 sauces on the table.   My only complaint would be the amount of the sides. We got the biggest combo that comes with four sides. We could've used more mac and cheese, just saying. :)   Finally, the music is good. I used to go to a biker bar in Gastonia (off Linwood, back in the day when a high schooler could get into a bar) and the music is the same. Nostalgic.",

    "text": "Stopped here 3 times during a 2 week business trip. We had a rule that we wouldn't do repeats, but we liked it so much we broke our rule. The first time was just drinks which was fine if you like beer, which I don't.  They didn't have much to offer in the way of fruity girly drinks, but they came up with a few cherry vodka drinks for me. The 2nd time we came for lunch.  The waitress was great as she knew we had limited time, and the pulled pork sandwiches were absolutely fantastic! My friend and I both had macaroni and cheese which was really cheesy and delicious, a 3rd party had fries. The Tabasco fried pickles were excellent, very spicy and crispy. The 3rd time we came with a friend from Charlotte.  We were only planning on drinks but the waitress sold us on 1/2 price queso and tacos.  The queso was very disappointing with chips out of a bag. My shrimp taco was decent but I was disappointed that the shrimp were fried as that was not in the description.  My one friend did not like her brisket tacos at all, and I can't remember what kind of taco my other friend had, but he did eat them all! Next time I'm in Charlotte, I would definitely go back for the pulled pork and macaroni and cheese.",

Irresistible to dogs like me. Nice, clean bone about 12 inches long with a skillet of tender meat at the end. By skillet, i mean 12 inches in diameter and two inches thick! Shared with the super carnivore and we still had half of it left. Never seen this cut before and it's a good thing i haven't.... We visited mac's twice in one week, tuesday, natch. Each meal featured that excellent meat. Mac's sides don't do me like the rib, but they're good enough. Potato salad was a solid choice, i forget my other.  Service was attentive. I like the mac's vibe, motorcycle theme, with booze and meat. Very popular, good for all the age groups.",

    "text": "A review from the vegetarians eye: I was deeply worried to enter an establishment specializing in \"pulled pork\" based on all the pig pickings I was forced to attend since my time here in the south . In any sense cooked pig are 2 words enough to send any non carnivore eating folk running. Our group ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and I can say the fried pickles give the penguin a run for their money. The breading was spicy yet crispy and ranch dip was not of the hidden valley variety. Deli-sh! I was pleased to see several choices available not containing meat aka salads. There were 4 salads you could add meat or fish to if desired. I bet if requested a black bean burger could be added atop your choice mountain of greens instead of a slab of meat. I ordered the spinach salad minus the bacon with blackened tilapia and poppy seed vinaigrette. The salad was pretty good but I thought the fish was way over-seasoned for my palette. Aka so salty it was difficult to taste the fish itself. In addition to salads a selection of 3 or 4 vegetables can be chosen as a main course as well. Both the mac n cheese  (stole a bite from my friend's plate- shh don't tell) and green bean casserole were tasty ( not as good as mine in my opinion but three stars good). There was live music outside and the atmosphere was festive but probably not nearly as festive as the south boulevard location so I hear. Our server was attentive to our 10 party group and I really liked the relaxed environment. I will definitely come back again and get a black bean burger instead of fish. Another order of those spicy fried pickles will also be on the list!",

    "text": "Man, I don't know what happened to this place lately. Seems the quality of food has gone down some in the past few months. The fried pickles just don't taste as good as they use to (they changed up the seasoning/batter) and the hush puppies use to be a lot better when they were not served as a complimentary appetizer. Don't get me wrong, I like free hush puppies as much as the next guy but before they were a bit more substantial and just tasted better all around. As for the other foods I've tried there, the Chicken sandwich is pretty \"ehhh\", the burgers are fairly good and the BBQ will probably always be this places saving grace since it seems to be good consistently. Also, the beer is reasonably priced and their beer specials seem to be worth checking out from time to time. This Macs does seem to have a nicer patio than the one on South Blvd and on Wednesday nights they run a Cornhole tournament in the summertime. Another for the minus column is parking. If you show up at the wrong time you can pretty much forget parking in their lot and will have to park on a adjacent street and hoof it over to the restaurant. Also, the service here can be spotty at times. All of that being said, I'll probably still end up going there for the time being because it is convenient to my house but if I ever move I seriously doubt I'll make the trip back their way.",

Onion Rings cooked to perfection. Their baked beans has this amazing bbq sauce that is in. And their complementerary hushpuppies comes with this oh so delicious honey butter sauce. Their staff is very friendly. And I would definitely go again. You jus thave to make sure you go with a hearty appetite!",

    "text": "So, as a through-and-through SoCal gal, I can tell you that barbecue in California is not the same as NC. I was visiting family for the week and we absolutely had to try the southern bbq cuisine that was so easily within our grasp.   Their Pulled Pork BBQ from the platters section was moist and delicious! They're also not kidding about lightly tossed with their bbq sauce. The meat slightly seasoned, enough to the point where you can eat it super happily without any additional sauce, but light enough so that other sauces at the table could be used.   My two \"side cars\" included mac & cheese and regular french fries. The fries were so good, and a great salty, sharp contrast to the barbecued meat. Mac & cheese tasted like they were deliciously homemade! The creamy cheese flavor had a perfect salt balance. Sweet potato fries, while good, were a little on the soggy side.   The St. Louis Rib from the Combo Platter was (!)#$*#_ delicious!!!! The meat fell right off bone and then apart in your mouth. It was perfectly coated with Red BBQ sauce, and had a deep smokey taste.   I'd definitely recommend the St. Louis Ribs with the mac & cheese side car. With those two options, you can't go wrong. Forget the sweet potato fries as it's nothing special (though I think they charge an extra $1). It's a place that I'd go back to if I ever visited the area again!   Service was on point - fast and polite, though I did get a good chuckle out of some of the startled stares because of my Asian face. Ha...ha... Mac's has a great sports bar atmosphere, but I felt a little confused with the sports bar, plus bbq, plus...racing/motorcycling(??) theme. In any case, it seems like a great place to be to hang out with friends and family.",

    "text": "I have been here a number of times and have driven by a million times at least. They have a lot of awesome sounding live music outside. Speaking of which, their outside patio area very spacious, and really cool looking for it to be so simplified.   The inside atmosphere, to me, is more sports bar, rather than the \"biker bar\" type of places they kind of pretend to be. They do have a motorcycle body hanging from the ceiling and the flyers and decorations around the room are biker oriented, but really, it's more sporty.  They have a lot of tvs and one of the factors that make them unique, or so I'm told, is that they play every NFL game.   Another positive is the beer variety. They have a HUGE selection to choose from and if you love trying new things like I do, you are bound to find some new beers to try on this list. Decision overload!  The food is tasty. I've had their salads, their burgers (including the vespa veggie burger), a fish sandwich, and their chili, as well as fries. I've found all of it to be pleasing. The prices are right on.   Negatives.  The type of people they draw in aren't really my type of people. Lots of aggressive looking people in khakis, untucked button down shirts with the top button unbuttoned, and sandals, with well groomed hair cuts, resting asshole face with a gleam of smugness and mostly making aggressive, loud outbursts that makes their friends around them happy.... especially the empty looking women who probably at one point in their lives pretended they were one of the women from Sex in the City and deep down think that their self-worth depends on how well they can S.A.D. Basically, the types of cool guy frat boys who look really successful but also narcissistic, and the shallow, sheepish women type that everyone else in the world love (just not as much as they love themselves). I don't though. Maybe I'm the asshole. A judgmental asshole. But most of us are so F.U.   This of course is not everyone there, but lots. Every time I've come here, it's been lots. Regardless, not my atmosphere.   I've been bumped into a lot here as the inside is super crowded. Really REALLY crowded. The tables and chairs are packed in way too tightly. Even over the loud murmur of crowd noise you can somehow hear your neighbors conversations better than the person or people at your own table. I am not exaggerating this. The parking lot is worse. They should move to a larger location.   I swear that the last time I came here, that my waitress was high as hell for the second half of our little unfortunate adventure with her. For one she sucked. She was slow, and very aloof. We didn't see her very long periods at a time. I even heard people at a nearby table (like 1 foot away) mention that she sucks too and so it wasn't just me. After her disappearance, I was relieved to see her because, well, we were wondering if she was okay at this point. She was. She was more than okay, as she was clearly blazed, which explains her prolonged absence. We got our check and she brought back our receipts, but no my debit card. Her potheadedness must have rubbed off on me because I didn't realize that she didn't bring my card back until later that night.   Nothing wrong with that. I used to smoke the devil's lettuce too, back in the day, but I also believe that weed amplifies the negative aspects of one's personality and if she already was a crappy waitress then being high just made her ten times worse and she shouldn't be trusted with people's debit cards. :)  Overall, the atmosphere just isn't for me. I tried coming here a few times thinking it would be a nice go-to place for a beer and whatever, but I will pass this place up more often than decide to eat here. I give it an A-Ok, but am not a fan (3 of 5 stars).",

Haven't had too many of the options yet, but so far what I have tried has been rather delicious. Burgers and brisket nachos especially! Burger has a real fat piece of meat, just the way I like it and they have some solid variations. Still think the place is just a hair overpriced, but definitely some tasty food and options. Great beer selection too, which is a nice plus when I'm dining in. Atmosphere is another plus.",

I haven't been to an amazing BBQ place since I've been here (just a couple of chain places) but I had been told by my coworkers that Mac's is supposedly one of Charlotte's best. Yesterday, I gave it a try.  First of all, the place has great ambiance. Biker Bar themed BBQ joint that is immaculately clean, and is bigger than I expected it to be. There is a cute patio too that seems like a fun place to have some Friday night cocktails in the summer.   The service was on point. I was there for lunch on a weekday and I could see that it gets busy around that time. Our server was nice and was at our table just enough, not too much. The food also came out really fast so that was great.  Now, the food. First, you get a plate of hush puppies. Not my favorite, but they were pretty good.  I ordered the small smoked turkey plate with collard greens and mac n' cheese. Maybe it's cause I'm new but the greens were to die for! You can't get greens like that in my home state and they were so tasty. A tiny bit spicy with lots of flavor. The mac n cheese was great too. The smoked turkey was alright. Maybe I just like pulled pork better but it still good. Also, it doesn't have much sauce on it which I was happy about because I like trying the different sauces on mine.  I'd definitely come back to Macs. The cocktails look delicious (Cucumber bloody mary? Um, YES) and I think next time I'd get the pulled pork sandwich too.",

They slow smoke them, then put your favorite sauce on and grill em.   Melt in your mouth good.  They stay a little pink due to smoking, but trust me, cooked through and through without drying out.   The best item here is, unfortunately, only available on Wednesday at lunch.   The smoked then grilled meatloaf is the best.  No soggy bread filled stuff here.  It's a solid 10oz of lean, smoked ground steak.  Comes with mash potatoes and gravy - or you can sub for another side (collards are my personal favorite). Add the 30+ beers on tap and great selection in the cooler and you're set.   Last but def not least.  The nicest servers, bartenders and managers.  Always looking to make your visit great and will fix anything anytime if not to your liking.  Dang - i just read this back. Sounds like I work here... but I don't.. just a regular who finally took the time to give Macs the props it deserves.",

The parking lot is a little cramped, even for the tiny car we took.  We were greeted and seated immediately and requested to sit outside, where there are a bunch of picnic tables. Our server was quick to get us waters and take our beverage order. There are lots of good beers on the menu, and most are $5 a pint. After placing our food order, we waited. And waited. And waited.  For a BBQ place, the wait is substantial. Eventually, an Eminem lookalike who was loudly rapping delivered our food (and some terrible rhymes), and everything looked good. One person in our group ordered a salad, and the server didn't bring his dressing until she stopped by to ask if we needed boxes. She was pretty bad.  The food itself is mediocre. The mac and cheese was fine, and the pork BBQ was decent. The ribs were the best part of the meal.   Overall, I will not come back to this location. I might give the original location a try, but my expectations will be pretty low. If you want BBQ, there are much, much better places in town.",

We only had apps and desserts but they were all really good (fried pickles were amazing). But how they went way above and beyond is that the next day, I realized I had forgotten to grab a copy of the receipt. I called as soon as they opened as my flight back home was in just a few hours. The manager helped me figure out my receipt and sent me a PDF copy right away, he was just so nice! He also remembered to tell me to have a safe flight and let him know if I needed anything else.

A couple people ordered the beer can chicken and liked it and a couple of us ordered the \"brisket\". So, when you order the brisket, they ask if you want fatty, lean, or both. I picked both. When it came to my table, I was dumbfounded. Thin, long pre-sliced pieces of dried out beef jerky looking pieces of meat with bbq sauce that looked \"lean\". I told the waitress i asked for both so she got me a new plate with the same sad, thin lean pieces of jerky. That's not brisket where I come from. Anyway, it comes with two sides and I picked a side salad which was a decent size and cheddar grits that looked liked creamed corn. However,they were nice enough to take my meal off the bill. I'm giving up on bbq until someone can show me succulent ribs, thick, meaty, fatty pieces of brisket and real grits. So for now, I'm done.",

Totally different feel... there's an actual, \"proper\" parking lot, but it is definitely not the same.  Went on a work night with a couple buddies and dinner and had a good time.  Started out with brews (which they do have a nice tap selection) and then ordered food.  Seems like the portions were smaller here, but there was no shortage of friendliness with our server.  Just a well oiled machine of cranking out BBQ.  Similar setup on the inside.... large bar to the right and movable high top tables in the center.  Oh yeah, this location had booths that flanked against the windows.  I think South blvd only had a few booths.  Since it was January and cold, I didn't see much of a patio, but it was partially covered (also where people were smoking).  Not as big of a patio from the original location, but it is good to note that it has one.  I'd probably go back if I find myself in the area, but I'll stick to my go-to South Blvd location for now.",

    "text": "I am in no way a barbecue expert.  That being said, I tend to be a bit of a barbecue snob.    But I'm not one to turn down my nose at barbecue that may not be \"authentic\".  I'll eat anyone's barbecue.  But I know the difference between good and great.    Let me put it to you this way.  After one taste of the barbecue here at Mac's, I now know why True barbecue snobs turn up their nose at what they consider to be inferior barbecue.    Because you just get the sense that this is the way it is supposed to be.    So now, me being a Philadelphia area guy, I now have had a taste of True authentic Carolina barbecue.  And I don't think I'm going to be able to look at anything else the same way again.    I tasted the sampler when I was here with pulled pork, beer can chicken, brisket, and ribs.  My first bite was of the pulled pork.  No sauce because I needed to taste it as is to truly judge it.  I'm a firm believer that good barbecue doesn't need the sauce.    Man, that first bite floored me.  The smoke was intense, the juices were flowing, this was perfect!    I almost decided not to use any sauce at all.  But I did eventually sample the red, and it was wonderful as well.    Then, the brisket was next which was good.  Maybe a little tougher than I expected it to be.  But I certainly ate it.    I downed the ribs next, and loved those.  Finally, I polished off the chicken which really wowed me again.  I like to make beer can chicken at home, and this was every bit as good as homemade.    Mac and cheese made the combo perfect.  I also got the grits, which I tasted and liked, but was too full to eat.    Now, maybe I'm crowing about this barbecue because I come from an area not known for great barbecue.  But I get it now.  It really is better in the south than what we get back home.    I don't know if I'll ever get back here, but I hope I do sometime.",

We started drooling before we even sat down because of the long line of constantly rotating taps (they even do something of a themed seasonal changing of taps each month.) Then we got our food. Now just repeat that last sentence about 153 times, as we go here often and have NEVER had a bad meal. It also doesn't hurt that they have the best fried pickles in Charlotte.  I think the best way to sum this review up is that every time we have guests in town we take them to Mac's. Last time my dad was down we went to Mac's four times. In one week.",

A little slow with the check which matters with young children (they get impatient and start bouncing off the walls).  It always seems a little loud but maybe I'm a prude. Kids did like the food though which gets a lot of points from us.  Solid 4!",

I have been coming here since they opened only because it is convenient to go from my office.  Beer selection is great, but the servers know almost nothing.  Ask them what  Lagers they have on draft and most of the time they stare at you wondering what a lager is.  A major pet peeve of mine is their hush puppies. ALWAYS soggy as if they had been sitting for hours.  It seems they cook them in giant batches early in the day and let them sit.  Their beef brisket is sometimes tender, but most of the time it is hard and dry, again, evidently sat there for hours in the open.  The chilly is offensive - my friend said it felt like spackle.   Some things I've had better luck with. Their deviled eggs are always great and so is their pulled pork. I will probably continue coming h ere for the beer but I will have to be starving to keep running my chances with their food.",

The first night we just had drinks since we ate elsewhere for dinner.  Nice service and reasonable drinks. 3 of us came for lunch a few days later.   3 pulled pork sandwiches, 2with mac and cheese and 1 with fries.  All fantastic.   Might be the best pulled pork sandwich ever.   The mac and cheese was really good but then I had 2 more mac and cheeses elsewhere that blew this out of the water!  Also had fried pickles that were really good.   tabasco flavor if I recall correctly.   Waitress was great and got us in and out in a hour since we were on our lunch break.    Mac's was getting a 5 from me at this point.  Then went again for happy hour.   Didn't plan on eating but once the waitress solicited half price tacos we were sold.   My friend liked her shrimp ones but I didn't care for the beef brisket. they were a 2 in my book.  and the chips and queso were also a 2.   Salsa 3.    Final rating will be 3.

    "text": "We've been fans of Mac's for some time, but didn't go all that often because it was too far to roam.  Then, we figured out that there was a location nearer... this one! And so, I've been more than once recently. We had some food catered (pork barbecue and Mac 'n Cheese) for a summer party.  Catering was easy to use, food was prepared perfectly and on time.  This is simply one of the best solutions when you are expecting company and don't want to cook yourself! If you haven't been to Mac's,  you just need to go!  So many good choices on the menu!!  Of course they are known for the barbecue.  Their pork barbecue is hard to beat!  But then, try a sampler...  You won't be disappointed in ANY of the meats at Mac's.  The brisket, the ribs, the sausages, AND the chicken... all are really good!  Several good starters... I like the fried pickles w/ ranch!  If you don't choose the Mac 'n Cheese as one of your sides... that's okay (more for me!), but you should. It's NOT diet food, but hey, you can WALK home if you need to make up for the extra calories!  I also like the baked beans and the collard greens.  Not so crazy about their green bean casserole... but others seem to be!  My friend (from SC) ordered the Brunswick Stew and said it was really good (and a little spicy too!)!  I'll try that myself soon... I'm sure! Beverages... of course they have whatever you might want, but for me... they have COPPER!!  Beer brewed by The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery, right here in Charlotte.  There is just nothing better (for me) with this barbecue!! So, this week, I ordered dessert. I never had before, because I was too darned full!  But the friend I was with wanted something, so I followed along.  Let me tell you... the Banana Pudding was simply some of the best I've ever encountered.  Now I have a real problem - how to go back and NOT order it!  If you find yourself stuffed, order it anyway and take it home to eat later. The only downside for this place is that parking can get a little short!  But that, in itself, tells you how good it is, right? I'm sure that I'll see you there... shortly!!",
