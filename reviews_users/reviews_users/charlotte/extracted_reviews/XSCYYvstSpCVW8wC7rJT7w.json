I'm almost certain they have to have new owners.",

I wasn't sure what to expect but it was a very small establishment, about 4 tables. The waiter was really nice (the larger set guy) however, I will not go back. My step dad ordered the curry chicken and he liked it but I think he was just really hungry and didn't want to complain. I order the 14 white meat meal with bac mac and their rice with cabbage and carrots in it. One of our meals were sitting at the counter for a long time and right before brining it out it looked like they dipped more sauce over it (I think it was mine). My food was really cold, the sauce was not even room temp so I couldn't even tell if the chicken was warm initially or not. I didn't even attempt to really eat anything else. The corn bread was cold as well. My mom ordered the wings, which were hot so I am assuming the other food was sitting out waiting for her wings to get done. Overall, I didn't like anything. It all taste like too much vinegar. It was a little overbearing taste. The waiter apologized and removed my meal from our bill. Not a good first experience but hey, you won't like everything.",

They claim it's rotisserie style but why do they deep fry the wings (not sure what kind of grease...but it's definitely fried wings). There are much better Caribbean resturants in Charlotte. This establishment lacks authenticity.   It appears the owner definitely understands some marketing (or at least his local \"demographics\"). This establishment has decent ambience...Carribean flags (minus Haiti - interesting?) hanging, popular reggae songs playing in the background and the usual borderline pastel colored painted walls. Oh, let's not forget the owner shameless \"hot sauce\" plug. At least they serve good ol' redstripe.",

As you get in close proximity, and particularly inside the restaurant, you wonder how it ever went un-noticed due to the \"loudness\" of the environment, decor, and atmosphere.   The Carribean menu is also very uncommon to the area. The menu variety is such that may or may not have been compiled from homemade recipies and \"twists\" on real Carribean delicacies. I can assure you, they pull this off well. My usual here is grilled chicken w/ calypso rice and some kind of special Carribean lemonade. It is very good and the spices are right on the money!   I've been out to the restaurant about four times now, and everytime I am greeted and served extremely well. Service is very quick.  They never seem to have much of a crowd. I'm unaware of how long the business has been in operation, but I do hope they have enough of a following to stick around.  This business caters as well.",

The decor is a Caribbean Theme with a hand painted mural on the wall (see one of the attached pictures).  You come in and seat yourself and a moment or two someone brings you a menu (I've never had to wait extra long for service...even when it's packed).  The place is casual and they play Caribbean music sometimes but I have yet to hear anyone who actually works there or cooks the food have a Caribbean accent....who cares the food is excellent.  My favorites are their crab cakes.  You can get these as an appetizer and they come out over Red Leaf Lettuce with a vinegar sauce sprinkled on top.  Succulent, fresh, full of flavor and the Caribbean tarter sauce that accompanies them parallel to the flavor.  You can buy this sauce to take home also...I bought some to serve with some crabs cakes I was making for our seafood Christmas.  The last time I choose to order the Crab Cake Sandwich, with Calypso Collard Greens, and Rasta Pasta.  The Calypso Greens have sauteed garlic and onions mixed in with a mild spicy vinegar taste added.  The Rasta Pasta is noodles with cabbage and carrots added.  Everything was good (see the attached picture) and I ate everything!  They also have great Beef Patties, Wings, and Rotisserie Chicken.  You can find a coupon for them in the yearly coupon book letting you get a meal free when you purchase one.  So if you want to try them out and not fork over a lot of cash then use this coupon but I'm telling you that you will not be disappointed.  One of the best Caribbean cafes here in Charlotte!",

I don;t always go to a carribean cafe, cos most don;t do the food any justice. But this place does it right.  Its kinda hard to find, but i think its worth the trip.",

So if children are imprtant customers here, why on earth are there no baby changing tables in either bathroom? We dined there with my family this weekend, and sure enough my 1 year old grandson needed a diaper change. So in the middle of the meal, my daughter had to LEAVE THE RESTAURANT to go to the car in the cold rain to change his diaper! Not good. Grandma and I eat here, but now I might not be such an avid customer anymore. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE if you are a family friendly place.",

    "text": "First off, let me say this: their cornbread is on another level of life...    Okay, so I went to Anntony's last night for a birthday dinner... This is another one of those places I've heard about a million times, but never visited... It's in a strip mall kind of thing, so if you don't know it's there, I guess you wouldn't really know it was there... It's a small, intimate place with friendly staff and televisions that you can see from pretty much any seat in the house...   The cornbread they bring out for you before your meal could have been my whole meal... It was sweet and crumbly in all the right ways... Awesome... I decided on the crab cake sandwich with rasta pasta and the callalou greens... The rasta pasta was a little lukewarm, but still delicious... The greens had a really interesting sweet-spicy-peppery-vinegary thing going on and I was a fan... The crab cake itself was fantastic... It was crunchy, held together well and was appropriately seasoned... The remoulade was good, too, but there was so much on my sandwich bread that it made the bread a little soggy... I just can't do soggy bread (it's one of my things... lol), so I just took the crab cake off and demolished it alone...   I actually met the owner... Turns out he was one of the guys serving us which I thought was really nice... He was really sweet and told me he was glad I was pleased with my meal and to come back soon... Definitely sounds like a plan to me...",

However, the oxtails were too sweet and chewy as if it didn't cook long enough, also needed salt. I would say at $12 the pricing was great and they gave me enough oxtails for my money. The rice and beans were cooked too long and didn't have any salt AT ALL. Talk about disappointing! I also ordered cocoa bread which I found out was old. I've been here a few times and it's always hit or miss. If ordering to go, I'd say check AND taste your food before you leave.",

We were even calling the place \"Anthony's\" before we got there... man it's always nice and humbling to look up and read what you had been calling the place for the last 30minutes was really incorrect.  My stupidity aside, we walked in and the place really is decorated to the nines with the \"Caribbean theme\" and I really liked the used of the tall ceilings to display the nation's flags.  Very casual and laid back... the servers were very friendly... I think my co-workers said we had to beat the lunch crowd, so I bet this place can get pretty packed.  I chose to go with the pork sandwich with mixed vegetables and plantains.   Had to wait the longest compared to my buddies, but it was worth the wait...  The waiter even came by with a piece of cornbread for me to much on.  My plate was cleaned and I was super glad I had saved my plantains for last... :)  I definitely have plans to come back and try the chicken!",

They cooked them correctly but it was lacking taste! The Mac and Cheese is okay. Potato Salad is disgusting. Where I'm from we have a huge Caribbean population and although they have the Caribbean presentation, they don't have the Caribbean taste!! The girl with the curly hair did a great job with her service though. The food is nasty,honestly. Please do not waste your money like I did. They also have this policy posted by the register that they are not responsible for missing items so you should check your food. A little odd for a business to not hold their employees for mishaps but it more of the customers fault. Charlotte has no good oxtails, unfortunately.",

The curry goat was watery and when the nice lady told us we had to pay a dollar more for another type of rice I knew this place wasn't gonna be good. Sweet plantain was good and that because how can you mess that up.   Back to the good. The oxtails were chewy and lacked proper consistency. The greens weren't great and the cabbage tasted more southern than Jamaican. Overall I was very mislead by the 4 star reviews and sad I took my friend there. She's never had Jamaican food and I'm not sure she'd want to try it again.",

The skin was soft and dripped of the tangy yet spicy sauce all throughout. Not too much; but enough to chase the meat with. The peas and rice had an incredible heat to them! Not in temperature; but in spice. They played well with the tangyness from the sauce. The cornbread was not a hit to me. I'm accustomed to sweet moist cornbread; and this was a little more stiff without the sweetness. Overall the meal was very satisfying!! My family enjoyed it.",

The wait staff wasn't horrible but I've had better.  The food was good. I had the ribs and now I see why they are called Succulent Ribs on the menu...because they were exactly that lol. The issue we had with the menu was that we couldn't order the oxtail or the stew chicken dinners because they didn't have any more. That sucked cause we really wanted the oxtail too. You would think they would be overly stocked with food on a Friday night but apparently not.  On another note, to the owner who has all of the flags from the Caribbean hanging from the ceiling, I politely ask that you please add the Haitian flag up as well. Since I'm Haitian, it was the first thing I looked for as we were being seated and was later told that they have it but it was not up. What's up with that?!",

I ordered the curry goat and it had more of a middle eastern type of taste to it, not quite \"West Indian\" like Caribbean food should taste like.

I am a True West Indian, born and raised, so can say I know a few things about True Caribbean food...and THIS AINT IT. The flavours we're not even the slightest bit Caribbean-esque. I mean the cook don't even look like she's from the islands. I give them 2 stars because the bartender was friendly and attentive.   I won't go into details about the dishes because at this point it's just not needed.

There is a difference.) with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ flavoring.  The curry goat tasted watered down, like it was frozen and then reheated and during that process the water from the potatoes diluted the flavor of the dish.   The \"spice bread\" was undeniably boxed spice cake. I was thoroughly disappointed.  The only redemption was the price and the Ting (you can't go wrong with Ting).  Perhaps the other location has better preparation?",

Even the chef yelled from the kitchen did you tell them it would be 25 minutes. I yelled back she sure did Chef...so make it worthy of Yelp and the Gram.   Man on Man was this dish worth it.

The chicken curry and roti were delicious - our craving was definitely satisfied! Their pepper sauces were also amazing! We loved the swank lemonade and the mac and cheese and rasta pasta. We both ordered entrees and ended up realizing it was a lot of food! So we ate one dish and saved the other for the next day. Everything reheated well and still tasted amazing, if not better.

I really wanted this to be great, but, alas it was not. The beef patties seemed like they were microwaved and the meat inside was not great. The Mac and cheese was dry, though it did have a perfect amount of cheese. Maybe the batch I had just cooked to long. The jerk chicken wings were not great. There was no umph to the skin of the chicken.  The server was friendly and attentive, so that was a plus. Like I said, maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but, I was not impressed. I am willing to pull a notorious B.I.G. and give them one more chance. However, this is where we stand based on this experience.",

    "text": "There was a time when this place was my only experience with Caribbean food. Back when there was only one location and no other Caribbean joints could be found in Charlotte. During that time, I would've given this place 5 stars based on sheer ignorance of what real Caribbean food tasted like. That time has passed.   The food here is ehhh. Not the worst but not really that good either. We ordered dinner takeout and I was left feeling like my money was wasted.  Starting with the jerk chicken wings. The wings were bland and the little bit of sauce on them had an overpowering sour flavor. The meat was fall off the bone but very dry like it's been cooked and left under a heat lamp for way too long.   Onto the entree - the hubs and I both ordered chicken curry. The curry was very mild and flavor and very runny. The chicken in It was probably not stewed in the curry as It had no curry flavor itself. The potatoes in the curry was the only good thing. The sides were not good either. The hubs ordered plain rice which he said was just ok. I opted for rice and peas - It was so dry and hard! Hard bits of rice and peas got stuck on my teeth in the worst way possible. Even pouring some curry sauce on It did not improve It. The sweet plantains were huge pieces and wasn't cooked thoroughly. The middle part still had a raw taste and texture to It. Now plantains are not like bananas where It can be eaten raw so just imagine that. The greens and cornbread were good but overall, our dishes were not worth what we spent.",

One time should not make or break a place so we went.  Upon arrival we were seated and our drink order taken.  Our waitress was very pleasant and efficient.  There was music playing at a comfortable level and the establishment was clean and colorful.    Both my date and I ordered Ox Tails, Cabbage, Rice and peas and it was served with Corn Bread.  Our food arrived within minutes of being ordered.  The food was so fast, it was if they were waiting for our arrival which was a pleasant surprise and very rare in the restaurant industry.  Unfortunately, I don't like spicy food so the cabbage was not to my liking.  The ox tails although tender in consistency, they did not have a lot of flavor so I would not have known what I was eating had I closed my eyes.  The food was fine, but just not exciting even for this second visit.",

A special treat was meeting the chief cook and bottle-washer himself as Anthony personally comes to your table to check on everyone and spread some of his island charm and share some experiences...  The staff was very attentive and friendly as is the island atmosphere.  A great getaway yet so close...looking forward to trying the curried goat, chicken, oxtail and everything else on this diverse menu.  Enjoy, John Duggan",

It also came with corn bread.  Absolutely phenomenal!   This restaurant is close to where interstate 77 and Harris Blvd meet.  It is next to a Food Lion, in a very unpretentious location.  The minute you walk in, you feel a Caribbean vibe and also notice how clean it is.  We were lucky that Tony, the owner, came to our table and chatted with us for quite some time.  Who knew he is an Osteopathic Doctor?  He has a million philosophies on health and food and drink and all things spiritual.   If I was not into the food, I would come back to talk with Tony.

At any rate Anntony's on WT Harris is a solid place for some good Jamaican food.  I have been there several times ordering different things. My favorites are the baked island wings, beef patties, ox tail, curry goat and callaloo greens (the rice and peas are a given). The service is always friendly and the portions are good. You can also get delivery via UberEATS.   In all honesty, there have been days where the seasoning hasn't been quite right, usually just low on salt. Otherwise, always well cooked and tender. I have noticed these inconsistencies less and less though so maybe they have a new cook/chef. Nothing has every been to the point where I haven't wanted to return.",

They have some meat pies, but other than that I wouldn't call this place traditional other than that.  Kind of Americanized.  Still great food though.  I havn't gotten anything besides a whole chicken in quite some time, because its just cheap, easy and feeds a lot of people.  Give them a shot, there aren't too many other decent options in the area.",

The waitress came to our table to take our drink order and literally didn't come back to refill our drinks or check on us to see if we needed anything.  We tried to give it another shot and ordered take-out instead, but when we ordered the takeout, we learned they were out of oxtail.   My fiance and I thought that maybe it was just an off-night so we gave it a few more tries, and for 3 consecutive visits, they claimed they were out of something we wanted, such as the oxtails, stewed chicken, curry chicken, or cabbage.... the list goes on.  It is disappointing because this has happened on more than one occasion, and we visited early enough in the day they they should not have been out already!   It became laughable as the last time we visited, we expected them to say they were out of something, and sure enough, they were out of curry chicken, so we walked out the door and never went back.",

The place was really festively decorated...flags hanging from the ceiling, art painted on the wall, plants and candles all around - a very unique inside design.  Our service was adequate is the way I'll put it - we had our orders taken and drinks served efficiently, but there was little personal touch to any of the waitresses.  The food however, was much more than just adequate - I had the crab cakes with mixed veggies and some Caribbean rice - all of which were great - they use some very unique spices that give the food some zest and a whole lot of flavor - I was shocked how much flavor some mixed peas, corn, and green beans could have!.  The prices were very reasonable - the two of us ate for around 25 bucks and each had dinner with several sides.  Overall, it was a great experience, easy to find and get to, and I'd definitely go back!",

I had the curry chicken, black beans, calypso rice, and plantains. I had my heart set on ox tails but they were out. Everything was good but not spectacular to me. My friend had the cuban sandwich with coleslaw and raved about it. She also had the coconut cake which she raved about also. They also had someone playing live music right outside the restaurant which I thought was pretty neat (and talented since he was a one man band lol). Even though I wasn't overly excited about my meal, the portions were plentiful and the service was excellent. I would come back and sample some of the many other options they had on the menu.",

Extremely informative about the food and recipes, and also very kind. We were so impressed with our lunch we came back again today to see Rachel and I got the same exact lunch because it was so perfect!

The decor is appropriately Caribbean caricature, and the food we had was Fan-F**king-Tastic!    I ordered the combo of rotisserie chicken and cuban pork, with a side of fries (I know, I know, but I was in a fry mood!) and greens.  The pork was good, tender, and well cooked; although I was hoping for pork shoulder, it was pork tenderloin, and the menu should probably clarify that.  Still, very tasty.  The chicken totally blew it away!  It was almost shockingly juicy, very well seasoned, and sauced with a sweet, tangy, and spicy sauce that I would probably drink out of a glass if given the option.  The fries were actually knock-out, and lightly seasoned with jerk spices.  They were thin and crispy, great for sopping up the juices and sauce off the plate.  The greens were good, with a nice vinegar tang.  My friend ordered beans and rice, which he loved.      We had a few Landshark Drafts, and are going back next week to try the oxtail!",

Today my wife and i stopped in for a draft beer (they have always had landshark and at least one other beer on tap) and some food but ended up walking out.  We sat ourselves down and then were greeted.  i asked what was on tap and the waitress read the menu which I know is not correct, the beer selection on there hasn't been right in years.  So I got up and went to the bar to look myself, it was some copper beer (NOT Old Mecklenburg).  Anyway, we both ordered that, a few minutes later the waitress comes back to tell us that both taps are dry.  Ok, it takes a lot for me to walk out of a place but this was it for me.  I will probably go back and try again but be warned, it looks like this place sadly might be in trouble.",

The meat all seems to be marinated in the same tangy sweet marinade so there really aren't too many surprises no matter what you get. I feel like if you like one thing, then you will basically like everything. One thing to note is that you should definitely take the time to get to know the staff and the regulars because not everything that they offer is listed on their menu. Hint Hint Wink Wink.",
