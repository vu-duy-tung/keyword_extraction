    "text": "[Southern Accent]Feller Yelpers,  This place was conveniently located near our plant in the Charlotte Industrial Park area.  Well, not that close, about a few minutes down the road.  This seemed llike a new spot and myself and my colleagues decided to give it a go.  Upon entering I was immediately taken back by the genericism (new word?) presented in this establishment.  It was spacious and open, however it lacked a certain [/Southern Accent][French Accent] je ne sais quoi[/French Accent][Southern Accent].  The walls were empty when comparing it to the absurd amount of paraphernalia found on the most generic of decorated walls at Applebee's (blech!).  So it was neither too much nor too little, the decoration was just bland.  There were however an obscene amount of TVs in this place.  I counted around 25 big screen TVs.  I suppose the budget went all to the TVs instead of any other decorative item.  This place has a sign outside with a dress code.  It was very misleading since it lead me to believe that this would be more or less an upper scale tavern with a sports bar feel.  Boy was I wrong.  This place was trying too hard.  We were all treated extremely well by our server.  Had we decided to play our hypothetical game of drinking a shot for each time that our waitress said \"y'all\" we would have been obliterated by the time the appetizers came out.  If I had a dollar for each time someone said \"y'all\", I could have paid for my entire lunch.  I would go on, but these are getting old quick.  Anyway, onto the food.  I ordered a Smothered Chicken entree (see my photo) which came with veggies and a fruit salad.  The chicken was good, there was nothing special about it.  The vegetables were drowned in butter.  I guess everything is drowned in butter in these bars.  It kind of defeats the purpose of ordering veggies.  The fruit salad tasted bland.  Overall, a very bland meal and atmosphere.  I would reluctantly recommend Hickory Tavern as a quick lunch bite for work breaks.  Perhaps the bar area would be a good place to sit and chill during games.  Therefore, unless you enjoy generic sports bars/taverns with gratuitous amounts of \"y'all\" being thrown around, I suggest you pass this one over for another option.  Later y'all.[/Southern Accent]",

    "text": "I don't usually write reviews about places like Hickory Tavern, but hey what the hell?!  This is your typical chain sports bar situation with the big TVs, the beers, and the random pop music in the background.  It's a bit nicer and pricier than some of the other sports bars, but at the end of the day it gives you essentially the same things.  There are locations all over the Charlotte area, and I assume they are all just about the same.    My favorite thing about the joint is that I always know what to expect.  The food is always solid, the service is pretty good, and there are food/drink specials.  If we are looking to have a couple beers and watch a game, this is the place we go.  In terms of the food, the burgers are good and they also do some decent shrimp and oysters.  This place went up a notch in my book recently when it finally got on board with the local craft beer scene and started carrying NoDa and Birdsong to go along with Olde Meck.  Better late than never.  So, if you are fellow Southwest Charlottean in search of local beer, you can add this place to your list of options!   Pretty good, but not great.  That about sums it up.",

It was a little crowded but we were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately.  Someone came to take our drink order and explained that she was not our server but our server would be right with us.  Our drinks were delivered and our server, Kristen, came to take our order.  She was very pleasant, friendly and efficient.  There was a large party seated beside us and every member of the HT staff that came by our table smiled and/or spoke to us.  I had the chicken tacos and DH had the tuna.  Both were seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  It was a great dining experience and I'm sure we'll be back soon.",

Last time we went no one helped us and we sat at a bar table for over 20 minutes (it was dead) we walked out and went to City Tavern instead. Well the other night we wanted a big salad so I called it in and my husband went and picked them up..I wrote down everything we wanted on them in advance and called and the girl seemed to get the order just right ... No problem ... So my husband went to pick them up.  Well I guess he should have checked the bag (I thought you only had to do that at drive throughs) and if we were not so hungry and the weather not so bad I would have turned around and brought them back myself .. There was next to nothing in the box ... These things are huge when you eat there .. You could see the bottom of the box , half the stuff I asked for was not even in the salad it was a joke and I was pissed after spending close to $40 on 2 salads ... At least I got a \"fair \" portion of the lobster I paid for or I would have raised hell .. Get it together hickory tavern you should be embarrassed... I was pissed and your kitchen staff can't even handle a salad order, pretty sad... Pics included.. I added my own spring mix lettuce when I got home . Next time I will just ask for a box of chick peas since that's all I got ....  Oh there won't be a next time so no worries... That's what I get for expecting a little more than crappy bar food for $40",

(Several tv's can be viewed in most of the dining room.)  Yep, it's kind of bar food... but I will say they have a great house salad (complete with bacon, tiny bits of ham and a sprinkle of cheese. It's like a little chef salad!).  I usually get that as an alternate to fries, but hubby loves their fries.  Honestly, our fave is their oysters!  $1 oysters (on the half shell or steamed) during happy hour.  And they have respectable wings too.  Not sure that I've branched too much further into their menu, other than burgers. Hubby gets sandwiches, and their pizzas look good, but haven't tried it.  Just kind of a fun, busy but relaxing place to catch a game or enjoy a beer and some good eats.",

We got sat ordered our food and 30 mins later we FINALLY got it. Again, the place was NOT busy. The kitchen or the server forgot to put in my order. Did they apologize? Nope. Were just very factual that it would be coming out soon. Manager did a quick walk by and said the same thing. Oh and my food...was an appetizer. 30 mins for an appetizer.  But the thing that just was so ridiculous was that all the servers were doing their closing work at the table across from ours. Which also happened to be right next to the entrance. Why would the manager have them sit so close to the door? And as they were rolling silverware, two of them dropped on floor. One girl goes, \"you know you can't use those now\" and the other girl was responded that she knew that. But the first girl then said \"Well not everyone who works here does.\" - so that was interesting.  But because we got to sit across from them, I also got to hear all about their sex lives. Who was sleeping over at a guys house, and then someone else who decided her date wasn't getting any action.   Sit the employees in a different place, re-train them on etiquette when food is late, what's sanitary and what's appropriate to talk about in front of customers.   I will be going somewhere else next time.",

The beer selection is pretty good and the bar area is still great but I considered this one of the places to go eat a decent meal and get a good beer. I cannot see myself going back anymore due to the lack of menu.   I mean the food still is not horrible but it just is not what it used to be. But if you do need a good beer give it a shot!",

And my review is primarily on the lack of service.  On several occasions, my friends and I have witnessed food sitting on the counter under the heat lamps, in front of the pizza oven for long stretches of time.  For example, nachos topped with sour cream, sat in the window for 10-15 minutes and had several servers walk by it.  At one point, there were three servers having a conversation right in front of the nachos.  No one made an effort to deliver the food nor notify the server who needed the deliver the nachos to their table.  The last time we went, we ordered nachos and saw them sitting on the counter and by the time they were delivered, they were soggy so we sent them back to the kitchen.  On this visit, our server was sitting at a table gazing at her phone while we were trying to get her attention.  We actually had to get up and go to her table to ask her for our check.  We asked her if she was on a break and she replied, she was eating.  If you are on a break, wouldn't you let your table know that?  I would have understood if they were crowded and busy but it was mid afternoon and there were more servers than customers.",

No worries I went through it so no other Yelper will have to. Thank me later.   In short, I didn't close the deal on the oysters but at least I now know to come after 4pm. They do have OMB on tap.

Server greeted us, I ordered one of THEIR signature cocktails and they were out of the signature vodka to complete my order successfully. So I just asked for a redbull and grey goose.  We placed our orders. When my partner placed his they were out of baked potatoes, strike two.  I order filet. She comes back after putting in the order and said you had a ribeye or by strip? I said. neither, I had the filet. She said I'm know this is the third thing you've asked for we are out of but we are out of filet.  I told her to bring the check for my redbull with a splash of vodka which was $14. That tasted like nothing but redbull.  Third strike for us that night.

Price is too high for 1 cluster refills with inattentive service \"We know they get cold.\" Per the manager on duty.  Here's a tip: If your customer specifically states she wants more, i.e. 2 clusters per refill, note she is not 5 years old. Also teach your servers to pay attention to the question, \"Can I choose any side?\" Otherwise, I don't expect an up charge on my bill. Not returning.",

    "text": "We ate at this location after church today and arrived after the lunch rush thankfully.  We had a party of four and were seated and welcomed right away.  I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich which is grilled chicken breast, lettuce, pepper jack cheese, sauteed mushrooms and guacamole, and it comes with tomato, but I opted not.  It was quite good, though messy to eat.  The steak fries could've used some seasoning, but were cooked nicely.    My husband got wings in Jamaican Jerk seasoning and a bowl of chili.  He said after we left that he could taste the freezer burn on his wings, he had asked for no chives and it came with them and had to ask (after waiting for our waitress to resurface) for a spoon for his chili.  Bummer.  Our two friends that joined us had salmon, one with broccoli and one with tater tots and both added house salads which were huge!  Both said it's a go to favorite at Hickory Tavern and were very pleased.  Our waitress was Kendall and she did a good job, probably not great, but good.  She was on top of things until the glasses got empty and she took a break apparently while we were waiting on our check.  We ended up flagging down another waitress because our friends had afternoon plans and needed to get on down the road.  Other than that she was friendly, got our orders complete and was helpful without being overly so.  We would go again if asked, and might plan to go back on our own soon as well to try some of the other dishes. I would technically go 3.5 stars to give a little room for more improvement, but I'll round up to 4 because my meal was quite yummy.",

We went here last night as our power went out once we got home from work and needed something for dinner, as well as a place to hang out since the power was estimated to come back on around 9 p.m.  The inside of Hickory Tavern is nice, but I feel like there are better setups with tables and tvs at other sports bars.  I think it could be a good go to option for watching a sporting event in the bar area, not the dining area.  The food, this is why you get a star Hickory Tavern.  Plenty of food options, but why bother if it is crap?  I can't speak for it all, but I have no desire to go back because of what I had.  I tried the philly steak sandwich with peppers, onions, and cheese.  The steak was so incredibly bad.  I had a bite or two and was done.  It reminded me of the frozen shaved beef you can find at the grocery store, but with an outdated and old flavor.  It was so bad, I do not think I have had anything as bad as that sandwich.  I would rather force myself to eat brussel sprouts.  Kevin had the fish taco and buffalo chicken taco, just okay.  Would rather drive to another area of Charlotte to go to another sports bar than go back to HT.",

We were here for a trivia tournament and they were able to easily handle multiple large groups from the tournament in addition to regular patrons. The same cannot be said for some past locations of the Team Trivia regional tournaments. It's a long way for me to travel to go to a Hickory Tavern, but I'm sure it's a good dinner spot or gathering place for a sporting event for those who live in that area.",

    "text": "So we have  been here a ton of times.  Usually just for drinks but today we decided to change it up a bit. Of course, we started with a couple of draft brews. While sipping our delights, we were approached by the bartender and told every Thursday during the summer is ladies night.  I filled out a form in hopes of winning some swag that was to be given away every 30 minutes. Sweet!  We waited.  6:30 passed, no announcement.  We waited.  7:00 passed, no announcement. I questioned, were they really giving out anything? Who knows! Restaurant and bar were half full at best. If I enter something, at least let me know I lost.  This place, crickets.   Let's move on.  We decided on the food truck menu Steel City Stack. This menu has creations specialized to a specific city, state and have featured the likes of Hawaii too. We decided on the Pennsylvania turkey sandwich with tangy cole slaw, turkey, and French fries served on crispy white bread.  Sounds delicious righttttttt!   We got turkey, white bread (not toasted), dab of coleslaw, fries and two slices of tomato = no taste.  Wow, if you are featuring a city, represent properly.  Disappointed on this creation.  Also waiting 30 minutes with a less than 50% occupied place and five cooks in the kitchen, should not have taken that long.   The final verdict disappointed on multiple ends, however, got something to fill my tummy for dinner.  Will I be back, yeah, I'm walking distance away so they are the most convenient for a brew desperate urge.  Side note: I have noticed service and food are diminishing and it kills me to see the bar tap touch every new brew poured.  A HUGE NO NO!",

The kitchen must have been behind because timing all over the front of the house, was off. Apps arrived with meals, or way too far ahead. Meals didn't arrive all at one time....it was just out of sync. This was all prior to us being seated.  I was in a group of 4 adults and two kids. We expected a wait and honestly, wasn't too long considering it was a Friday. Our waitress was in the clouds though. She got my order very wrong after I watched her write it down, word for word. Something as simple as chicken tenders, baffled her. I will give her credit for owning up to it when I questioned if I another persons meal.  The kiddos spilled two cups of water and no staff member was in sight to offer towels or new water. Luckily, tables turning was slow and there were paper towels left on a neighboring table.  A variety of items were ordered and nothing really stood out. The pretzel app was actually pretty good but otherwise, less than impressed. Considering the quality and quantity of food, the price seemed a bit off, too. Will definitely choose some of the new local spots before going back to Hickory Tavern. Generally, I give chains the benefit of the doubt since there are regulations and standards involved. I have visited this location on a few occasions and honestly, will only do so if I'm out voted among friends.",

I frequently have the steak when we come here. The steak is pretty good and always more than I can eat! The steaks come with a starter salad that is almost big enough to be a meal itself and loaded with ham, thick cut bacon, eggs and tomato. I also get the loaded bake potato to split with the boyfriend as my side. It is ginormous and they stuff it full of delicious unhealthy toppings.  Last night we went for the .75 oysters and .5 shrimp. The oysters were incredibly huge and decidedly fresh. The shrimp were a little over done but for 50 cents a good deal. On Thursdays they also have half priced bottles of wine which made the meal even better.   If you are in the area and looking for a clean and friendly bar or to grab a delicious meal let me know. I am always happy to come here.",

It has seafood,  burgers, nachos, and YES! An awesome bar.     What makes this Hickory awesome is none of the above.   Yes, I love their bar. And yes, I even like their menu.  But what makes this place great is their bar team.  These guys rock.  Not only do all the bartenders know their selections like the back of their hands,  they seem to share info amongst themselves and know just what drink to offer when you need it.  I can't sing their praises enough and I enjoy having a drink,  watching TV, and munching on any number of awesome appetizers.   Now, as far as the restaurant section is concerned,  I'd advise to stay away. Nothing seems to run as smoothly as the bar area and the service is just ok.    Regardless, the kitchen staff rocks and everything I've ordered over the past 4-months had been nothing less than perfect.   Kudos to the bar area and kitchen",

What makes this a two-star review is that every single time I have been, regardless of the complexity of the order (which is never that complex, it's your standard American restaurant fare), the food takes FOREVER to arrive. I have never waited less than half an hour for food there, and once, one member of our party waited an HOUR for - wait for it - a quesadilla. I could have gone to a grocery store, bought the items for it, and cooked them on my car engine in that amount of time. The manager came out once and explained nothing, just vaguely apologized for the wait. If the restaurant had been busy, it would have been more understandable, but the restaurant was at *maybe* 1/5 capacity.

First, sanitation score: 94.5  Second, no greeting. We finally seated ourselves  Third, slow service   Fourth, greasy app plates  Fifth, nasty staff: I literally watched several different staff come out of the kitchen scratching their hair, rubbing and picking at their faces and one girl LITERALLY picked her nose at the bar while waiting for a drink order and LITERALLY rolled whatever she dug out between her fingers OVER the damn drink garnishes!!!!! WTF?!  We told our server who told the manager but came out and said because the girl was now off the clock they couldn't do anything. The manager came and apologized and said they threw away the fruit and that it's not how they are here. BS. I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES.   The food wasn't great at all. I ordered the charred wings and my partner tater tots. It literally took 45 minutes for no clear reason. The kitchen staff was cleaning and scrubbing and I guess breaking down the kitchen 4 hours before close. The tots tasted like they were cooked in old grease.   Overall I just didn't feel comfortable because I felt like the staff was unsanitary. I won't be back to this location ever.",

    "text": "So....I have been to several of HT throughout the area but this particular location is closest to me but my least favorite. For the most part the food is on par with the other locations but we always have some issue at this location.  Four of us went this past Saturday night to watch come collage football. We expected it to be packed but it wasn't probably about 50% give or take a little throughout the night.  1) Both couples ordered oysters. Took a while for them to come out but we were not in a hurry so that isn't an issue however the issues were they were brought on undersized plates so they were falling off. Still no big deal. However, we did not get crackers, lemons, cocktail sauce, horseradish OR SHUCKERS. After about 10 minutes waitress comes by and we ask for these items and I order a beer. After about another 10 minutes the items show up but by then the oysters were cold but we were hungry so we ate them. Still no beer, ask again and it finally comes after about 20 minutes.  2) When the waitress cleans off the table from the appetizers she tries to carry to much a 3 plates shatter on the ground. No biggie, it happens.  3) Order our entrees, 2 of us got crab legs. Food arrives at different times. Salads after cooked items. Ehh, just happy to have our food. The crab legs were kinda salty but more importantly we each had several legs with no crab meat. Where did it go, IDK. Disappointed.  4) Advised the waitress we'd be there watching for a while to leave our tabs open. She says of course. Next thing we know she shows up with the bills. Which we sent back as we ordered another round.  I am pretty chill and have never given a bad review before but it seems to be something every time at this location. I once slipped on the bar floor due to water being puddled up which I didn't see. Mgmt at the time which is not the current mgmt was rude about it like it was my fault.  I wish my local HT would step it up.",

She also made great suggestions to my little cousin who wasn't feeling well. She wanted to make sure she had something that would be comforting to her.  Food tasted great, and I will say they don't have a lot of vegetarian/vegan options available. This should be something the manager could look into expanding on the menu.   As we were wrapping up dinner, Jonathan the manager came out to say hello and if there was anything that we needed. I failed at the time to mention the idea of including more vegetarian/vegan options on the menu. Hopefully, this will be something they can add soon if so I would love to be your taster :-)",

We waited about a month after they reached out to me to give it a bit of time before we returned. We have since been back a handful of times, and it seems that there might have been a bit of turnover for servers, and we have not had the issues that I stated above. I had a General manager reach out to me to apologize for such poor service time and time again, which I was quite surprised at. He had asked me to introduce myself so that he could personally apologize when I came in next, which I did not do, as I wanted to get a True sense of if the service had changed or not. So far, it definitely seems like it has.",

To preface the place was not busy 3/4 of the tables were empty. First it took awhile to order drinks and when they came they were the wrong beers.  Then another 20 minutes to get 3 beers. Once we ordered food the wrong food was brought out. 3 of the 5 orders came out and at that time they said they were starting to cook the other 2 orders!  After the food arrived they never came back to check on us, refill waters, clean plates or offer more drinks. The manager casually walked by at least 3-4 times  and never once took a dish or filled a water glass. We asked to speak with out waitress and the manager referred to her as \"the big girl\" which is very inappropriate. We finally asked to speak with the manager about the poor service and were met with a blank stare. It was very obvious he did not care at all. No apology nothing.  We all have worked in the restaurant business and know this is not how you handle customer complaints. Hickory Tavern just lost 5 families business.",

But it's a great place for some apps, bar food and couple beers. Now if you're taking about good food, no I didn't say all that. It's subpar.   Restaurant: 4/5 they tried to keep up with busting tables as much at they can.. I do give them effort in trying especially when that's a game or a fight on.   Staffs: 3/5 some staffs can be a little better when it comes to customer service but I never got one that's out right rude or short. All are pleasant!   Food: 3/5 as far as bar food. Yes it's ok. I would need a beer to go with it.. I had the crab dip once. Didn't care for it.. my cheeseburger (twice) have ingredient(s) missing from it. Like the grilled onions.. I'm just too annoyed to ask for it.. Had the grilled salmon once.. Pretty dry. I guess they're trying to make sure that piece is die. Their chicken wings (bar food) is pretty good.   Hickory will be the place I'll go to if I want to watch a fight or hang with my friends for a game. But it's NOT a place I would recommend to take my friends if we want some good cook home dinner!",

    "text": "My friends and I went in really late last night (Sunday) because it was the only place around that was open until 2:00 AM.  We ordered a few beers and some food off of their late night menu. We all quickly noticed their 75 wings, since they were such a good deal!! It took a little while for our food to come out, but that's to be expected at midnight on a Sunday. (Slow periods = less staff = longer wait times) The beers came out quickly and our server Nicole was great about checking in with us!  After Nicole came to check how we liked the food, a few of us ordered more food and beer. One of my friends ordered ONE chicken wing, because he wanted to try a specific flavor. She happily obliged. Later, she came out with a COMICALLY LARGE dinner plate with a single wing in the middle. She said that the kitchen definitely plated it that way on purpose to be funny. We got a huge kick out of it, saying that it looked like it an overpriced minimalistic meal at a fancy restaurant.  Great experience. Definitely going back. Thanks again, Nicole!!",

Around $8, and worth every penny.  Expectantly, the bartender was a little green on the price of a Guinness draft, but, I mean, they are new so that's fine.  Extremely nice and attentive bartenders.  My first time coming to this location and I'm really pleased with the interior.  It features: gigantic projector screen(s), flat-panel tv's, classic sports bar arcade games (bowling, golf,) as well as skeeball!, clean bathrooms (however, on a different note, the right faucet of the men's bathroom is a little unsecured from it's base), nice tables and booths, and a great atmosphere with music at the right volume.  Can't wait to make this my personal sports bar!  As good as it gets!",

That being said, during our a meal a group of clearly over served people were being incredibly loud and rude and drawing inappropriate images in the condensation on the windows of the restaurant , a girl from this group then proceeded to shoulder bump an employee and started cursing at the employee using racial slurs and slamming her beer on table, this happened literally 2feet from our table we had to go in and search for management meanwhile being cursed and yelled at by the drunk girl who has now started to try and physically assault people  as well as her belligerent boyfriend, our meal was not discounted in any way the manager did virtually nothing to diffuse the situation we took half our meals to go , only to learn on our way out the door that the drunkard , Nicole Edwards , is actually an employee of that hickory tavern who was off duty and drinking to excess .... This was a ridiculous experience that's poor management and poor judgment on the part of the bartender who served someone to that extent. Our 4th of July was ruined and we will never be back.",

If you turn your head away you are looking at another flat screen. The only way I could not see a flat screen was by looking down at the floor or up at the ceiling.   Really cool looking place. Beautiful interior and upscale from most sports bars. It actually looked a lot like the Sports Book in a Las Vegas Casino.   I was with 4 others and we sampled many items for our massive over filling lunch.   Service was excellent, 5 stars   I ordered the Rubin Sandwich, everyone else had wings, burgers, chicken and Phili Steak.   I would rate most of the food 3 stars, except the Rubin which I rate at 4 stars. The wings were not good and I penalize them severely for being a sports bar with very average wings.

I just wish they had better beer prices, something like a domestic beer for $2 during games would be great. Also the menu prices are steap $12 for a burger is a bit over the top. The only reason my friends and I opt to go to another place instead is strictly due to price. Have a special Sunday football menu or something that would go along ways I think.",

    "text": "After many trips to Hickory Tavern over a few years, I will say I love the oysters for 69 cents on Thursdays, as well as the salads, and the veggie burger. And, we have had good service on numerous occasions. But, we have also had terrible service several times. I rarely see a manager, and at this point, I am pretty fed up.  Out here in Steele Creek, there are not many dining or pub choices, and I and my circle enjoy cold beer and oysters, so, yes, we have been to Hickory Tavern many times.  Once,  were charged 50 cents for barbecue sauce (as a substitute for mayo/ketchup/mustard on a burger), and they refused to budge when we questioned it. A small thing, but annoyingly petty, in my opinion. Another time, they suddenly changed their Thursday beer special, and although someone in our party had asked the price, and the waitress misquoted it, we were all charged a higher price for our beers. I asked the waitress about it and she said that the price had JUST changed in the computer, and asked if I wanted her to take the difference out  of her tips. No, really, she actually asked me that. On a separate trip -- we decided to go back, but just make sure we were not in that particular waitresses' section -- a friend ordered the new flat bread with kalamata olives. It arrived with no olives, and the sliced tomato on top was pink (like salmon). My friend barely tasted it, and said it was inedible. The waitress never checked on us, and so I shared my sandwich with my friend. So she could eat! When the young waitress finally came back by the table, she asked if my friend needed a box for her pizza. My friend said no, and asked her to just take it off the bill, and they did. Which I guess was one of the classier things they have done, in my experience. The final straw was when we went ANOTHER TIME (unbelievable, I know) and ordered beers at a table in the bar area, and then waited, and waited, and waited. No drinks. Finally, we just left. It was not busy.  These days, it's hard to justify spending money to drink average, domestic beer and eat bar food out. If we're going to be treated poorly, I would rather save my money, drink better beer at home, and cook. I miss the decent,, independent restaurants and sweet little dive bars in the area in which I used to live, closer to uptown. Unfortunately, I guess these kind of places are often what you get out in the burbs. It's too bad.",

BOY..was I wrong. I ordered a basic tavern burger and my friend had twelve wings. My first issue was the line cook was leaning across the bar when we walked in and this was no more than fifteen minutes after placing our to go order. Our food was already bagged up and ready which was my second issue. I'm in the food and beverage industry so I was skeptical once we received the food but the bartender provided great customer service and I was engaged in conversation so I made the mistake of not checking my food (my mistake). As I left,the same cook who  made my food was outside smoking a cigarette as if he had been working hard on preparing QUALITY FOOD. I got home and opened up the bag and realized I received seven of the twelve wings and a luke-warm burger. The worst part was the wings had been pre-dropped obviously because they were dry and flavorless.  I'm in the food and beverage industry so I would understand if it took me a long time to get the food or if I stayed far away. I live not even three minutes driving radius from this establishment.  To say the least this was the second bad experience I had here and I will not be back to spend thirty bucks on poor quality food.. I advise anybody to pick another place to eat.",
