The server was friendly, but overwhelmed. The taste of the food was on par with all other Ihops that I have dined.",

Being from SC the IHOPs there are on point with service and quality of food. But this one was horrible on a Saturday morning which is there most active time. They were understaffed causing a 20min wait, which is typical for an IHOP. Get to our seats order our beverages and meal. My hash browns were cooked to a dark brown.  My wife food had hair on both plates. I would not recommend this place. Go to midnight diner for breakfast! Enjoy!",

Well, that wasn't an issue here, and that's usually my major issue with ihops. Also the menus were not sticky, another plus. Service was friendly, smiley and prompt. I come to ihops for their distinctly buttery pancakes and their perfect hash browns, and was satisfied there. But. The men's bathroom was NASTY. Narsty. Gross. Dave came out looking traumatized and preferred to wait out the ride home than go near those funknasty toilet seats. Step it up guys. Even if it is next door to a strip club.  So bring your purell if you want to clean your hands and vacate your digestive system prior to coming, and you'll be fine.",

Our first choice was a local diner, but the crowd was unbearable, so we chose to visit Ihop. Mistake #1. The crowd was also large, but for another reason. The staff upfront let us know that the kitchen was backed up, but that is all. We weren't given a wait time or anything. After about 45 minutes, the manager of the restaurant came into the lobby and did not address any of the customers about the supposed \"kitchen backup.\" Mistake #2. After that, my friend attempted to get her attention, she ignored her and moved along. Mistake #3. So, we didn't wait around for mistake #4 because I'm almost certain it was coming. We left before our hunger got the best of us. I personally would have been fine with the wait if management would have addressed the crowd to explain the hold up, but since they did not, we left. I'm certain in saying I'll never return to an Ihop again. Especially this one!",

Meanwhile this drunk homeless guy is wandering around the front lobby where they left my food. He could have fapped all over my food for all they know.....   Finally she shows up 5min later, only to forget the utensils. Another 5min later she shows up with utensils and I finally get to leave with my meal. Walk to the hotel only to find out they forgot the pancakes that come with the meal, the eggs were cooked wrong, and one of the stuffed french toast things had ZERO filling.......NEVER going here again!

We found parking right away and there was no one waiting in the lobby. This should be a quick lunch....right?!   Wrong.   We tell the host and he says \"can you wait 10 minutes for a clean table?\"I'm sorry was there some wrong with the twenty CLEAN tables we can clearly see available?! To make matters worse three severs came and asked us if we wanted to be seated....hmmmm....so if the servers are ready to seat us.....why are we waiting again?! That's strike 1!   We finally get to our table and our waitress takes our drink orders and disappears....when she finally reappears she has our drinks and asks if we're ready to order....hmmmm....it's been 20 minutes so I'd go with YES. I ordered the Spinach and Mushroom omelette with fruit as my side. And then the waiting game begins again.....cue the jeopardy music! We waited....and waited....and you guessed it! We waited....and finally our food arrived. And after all that time it was barely warm! But I was starving and we had to get back to work so sending it back to the kitchen wasn't an option. Ugh. At least the fruit was decent. But still that's strike 2!   When everyone's done we get the check and go up front to pay and here's where the fun begins! We have to wait for the manager to count (out loud) the cashier's drawer, answer the phone and chit chat with the staff! Couldn't this wait?! To make matters worse he wasn't very happy about separating the checks. Yes! We still need separate checks! No! Asking us again and again won't change that! Do you want to get paid or not?! Strike 3!!!  Folks, that's three strikes and your OUT! I'm happy to take my business somewhere else.   But seriously.....Get it together IHOP!!!",

I'm not sure if they are understaffed, but they definitely seem to be lacking in housekeeping.   It was a little frustrating that they were out of orange juice since it is a breakfast restaurant. I had to get apple juice and it was served warm for some reason. Our food came out pretty quick and everything was good.",

We came on a Saturday morning and they were out of sugar packets....our server said the truck wouldn't be there till Monday, so she brought over a (clearly) used small ramekin of sugar to sprinkle in our coffee. We then ordered our breakfasts and after we ordered, or server came back and said she forgot to mention they were out of bananas (part of my order) and smoked sausage (part of my husband's) - stating the truck problem again. My husband switched to bacon, but I didn't get an option. Our food came out, and our eggs were great, but both our hashbrowns were brown and crispy on one side and basically frozen/cold on the other. The bacon was very rubbery, and some parts undercooked. Our server was nice, but had more table than she could fully pay attention to, so we didn't bother her with the still cold potatoes or anything.  Again, I know it's not a high end spot, but there are just some breakfast staples you need to get right.",

The waitress did come around a couple of times and say that there was a problem in the kitchen.  But two tables(with larger groups than ours) that came in after us had already gotten their food and was almost finished.

This is the first time I truly felt like the staff was demon possessed and didn't like their jobs. It was the first time I actually suspected they might have tampered with my food.   It's a chain restaurant and I expect a certain processed food quality to it all. But when I see that half the restaurant is dirty, AFTER I had to wait 10 minutes before being seated...   When the manager gets a phone call and comes to answer it while folks are waiting in the lobby, but no one is bussing tables...then goes back to the floor like they see no one in the lobby...  When you are served your coffee, then immediately after your pour your cup all the wait staff finds a reason to go past your table and ask \"are you ok?\" You start to suspect someone did something to your coffee and they are looking for a laugh when you drink it.   When you don't drink it and instead leave it and go with the rest of your meal which tastes terrible like someone spiked the pancake batter with unmentionables and they take forever to bring your check as if they're waiting on the show... there's a problem.  I already had a great experience at an IHOP in Ballantyne after church. That place was great any clean and tasty and the staff was on point and very friendly.  But THIS location, looked like the projects and trailer trash all came together to make a terrible dining experience. It smelled terrible like when you have a cockroach infestation...you know that musty oily smell that only a cockroach would love - apparently they're used to it...and one of the servers apparently put blue cheese dressing in the ranch bottle, another order wasn't cooked completely (chicken apparently) and the manager looked like she didn't have it together. Maybe bothered by here boyfriend who called her at work.   There are other IHOPs. If you aren't stuck at a nearby hotel with no car rented, or got no access to Uber, be warned this is still not a convenient place. Deal with no pancakes then.   Otherwise, drive another 5 minutes away to the one on Tryon street or something. You'll feel skeezed after this place.   I still feel dirty 2 hrs later.  Thanks for reading.",

We were seated and it took a good 10 mins to be greeted by our server. We quickly discovered they were either short staffed or this location has a terrible manager running the joint. Several tables around us weren't bussed from the time we sat to when we left. The table next to us was handled only two forks (for a table of 4) and said sorry this all we have. Our water was served in foam to go cups. When our food came out there was cheese dried on the side of my plate that didn't come on my meal and the bottom of the side plate was coated in red strawberry syrup. Did the dishwasher not show up??  We ate and got out of there to laugh at how disgusting it was. This is probably why I don't go to ihops. My mistake",

Continuously yelling about how she had worked a \"24 hour shift.\" This is the worst possible place, avoid at all costs. We also waited 45 minutes for two orders of pancakes and there were FOUR people total in the restaurant. We will never return!",

I've never gotten sick, but who wants to have to have bad service AND have to send their food back two to three times....every visit!! I was at a conference and the hotel next door and decided to grab breakfast here afterwards. BIG MISTAKE! While waiting to be greeted (a few employees walked right by me without so much as speaking), another woman was at the podium looking for her server who had apparently taken their order and disappeared. We chatted and both said we had not had good experiences here in the past...yet here we both were again...wait, did I just answer my own question? That's how they're still in business. My waitress was nice, but it was apparent that she had more tables than she could handle. Asked for over easy eggs and twice they were fried hard...not sure how that happened. Asked for pancakes cooked light, they were light on the top, but the bottom was over cooked and hard to even cut through. In addition to that it tasted burnt. I ended up just eating the bacon and hash browns and asked to be charged for just that. The manager never came to the table. I was told she knew who I was and would take care of it at the register.   Add this to your list of places NOT to eat...like ever",

I came in it was semi busy but I noticed there were many employees standing in plain view laughing and talking but no one greeted us or sat us down yet. Waiting patiently I noticed a lot of the employees bickering and cursing while speaking bout an employee who they supposedly didn't like. One of the same girls I noticed talking earlier was supposed to greet people at the from but wasn't at her post. She got menus then threw them on a table for us to sit down. After sitting down we ordered and everything was going fine until I could hear two older employees talking about some girl who didn't clean up her tables. Immediately after realizing they mistakenly cleaned her tables they started messing them up throwing stuff everywhere i honestly was shocked! I got the wrong food the wrong drink and my fiancees steak was not well done at all. As We was waiting for the check I noticed one of the older employees from earlier still complaining and backing into the farthest corner of the restaurant I saw her take Her ihop shirt off and put on a red shit with only a bra on!!! I was flabbergasted at that point it's time for me to go and never come back! I'm warning you DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! All you will get is cold nasty food lots of employee beef and an experience that you will never forget;and definitely not in a good way. As I'm typing this out they are still bickering, IHOP couldn't pay me to come back here go to the other location off of Arrowood and S. Tryon by the Walmart trust me you will thank me later! I wish I could give zero stars!!!",
