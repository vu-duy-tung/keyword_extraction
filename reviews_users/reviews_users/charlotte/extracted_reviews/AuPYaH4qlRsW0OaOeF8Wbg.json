Simply stunning sandwiches - from the Reuben to the Muffaletta to the Grilled Cheese, you will be bowled over by the owner's uncanny ability to pick just the right mix and amount of ingredients to elevate the mere sandwich to a heavenly experience.   Grab a cider from Botanist and Barrel while you're there - the Emanation or any of their sours provide a wonderful way to wash your delish sandwich down.  And that doesn't even BEGIN to say how fabulous their charcuterie boards are - such amazing choices and pairings of cheeses, meats, olives - oh my!  Friendly and passionate owners, sleek indoor digs as well as a cool patio - this place is a jewel.",

The meats in both sandwiches were some of the best we have had. The bread on the Ruben was very flavorful. The Ciabatta could have been a little less chewy, but had good flavor.  We chose the greens as our side, the dressing was amazing! We are already planning on what to order our next trip. If you need stocking stuffers for your foodie, go here for sure!

So, I really like this type of place, I will admit ahead of time, just the setup and offerings are what I am all about.  The menu consists of meat and cheese boards, sandwiches and  a few apps and salads.  They follow that with a solid wine and beer selection, all in bottles and cans, no draft but not needed.  The alcohol is a small variety but high quality and clearly the product of someone that is making an effort to have good beer and wine.  We really enjoyed the meat and cheese plate we ordered.  The offerings were eloquently explained by our waitress.  The first thing we noticed was how plentiful the  accoutrements were on the board.  Marcona almonds, honey, lusty monk mustard, dried apricots and a few others.  It was a solid selection of two meats and three cheeses, including a smoked blue cheese that was something I have never had.  We watched what appeared to be the owner making a huge catering board that looked incredible.   I grabbed a half pound salami and Benton's bacon to go as well, the wife got some UAV ricotta.  We can't wait to go back, I love this place!",

I had the chipotle turkey sandwich and a good amber ale.  Wife had the grilled cheese sandwich.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "Wow.  Totally blown away by this place.  I was on yelp to see something else and when I spotted a Hot New CHEESE SHOP in Matthews we were in the car ten minutes later and on our way over.  The shop itself is super cute, the people there are fabulous and friendly... and omg the food.  We had the cheese and charcuterie plate and to be honest, this was outside my comfort zone - cheese, meat, bread - all good.. but fruits, honey, nuts, jams and olives??  Not for me.. until today that is... that was the most unbelievable assortment of amazing food that never in a million years did I want to try and I would happily have it as my second choice for every meal for the rest of my life.  Second choice?  Doesn't sound like that high of praise but the ONLY reason it'd be my second choice is because I also shared THE most amazing grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  Gouda, cheddar (lots!) all beautifully melty on this fabulous sourdough bread with pepper berry bacon jam?  YES PLEASE.  Cannot express just how good the food was and how it made just a regular old lunch feel like we'd celebrated a special occasion of some sort, but it was THAT good.    I hate to even tell anyone because full disclosure, I'm not wanting to fight for seating in my new house of worship and I know once this place catches on it'll become crazy busy, but if I keep it entirely to myself their business won't take off and I can NOT let them not make it because well, they're great people (and oh... the food... did I say?)  Wow.  Run, don't walk.  And trust me on the grilled cheese... (I cannot WAIT to go back and try the dinner menu!).",

The interior is pristine, white subway tile and gleaming metal slicers as far as the eye can see. We sat at the bar and had friendly, attentive service. It was fun to watch the crew working behind the counter. The owner was even assembling a meat and cheese platter for a special order that was seriously a work of art. I even commented on how I wouldn't be able to eat the first piece, it was just so beautiful.   I enjoyed a glass of red wine and Ted downed a few IPAs. Alcohol selection was solid all around. It would be fun if they eventually got a few draughts! We shared the meat and cheese board. Everything was delicious and so thoughtfully paired. The blue cheese with oat cakes and goat milk caramel was my favorite pair. Not far behind was the salami and honey. We took a couple meats and a container of UAV ricotta home to enjoy later.   So looking forward to The Loyalist Market becoming a regular hang out spot for us. We loved it so much, I even told my husband, \"I could live in Matthews.\"",

The wine and beer selection is varied, both on draft and what they carry in the market, which is a nice change from the IPA heavy selection in some establishments.  And let's just go ahead and mention the Mac n' cheese special on Tuesdays. I've had several items off their menu (always pleased!) and had a small meltdown when I tasted the Mac n cheese. Great flavor, tons of gooey cheese, and you can top it with smoky meat goodness (or veggies upon request).   They are known for their beautiful meat and cheese platters, but the LM offers so much more! I'm dying to try the house made ham biscuits on Sundays. I'm sure it will not disappoint!!",

We went in with a group of 6 and sat at the large family style table they have inside, there is additional seating at smaller tables and at the bar. The space is clean and inviting, brightly lit with an open concept setup.   The customer service was amazing, everyone there was friendly and knowledgeable about their products. They gave great recommendations on beer, wine and of course--CHEESE.   We ordered the devils on horseback and they were delicious. Crispy, served hot and super flavorful. One order comes with 5, I absolutely recommend it.  We also ordered a cheese and charcuterie board. It was beautifully structured, and everything was great. The experience of not just eating cheese--but eating cheese paired with different items to truly enhance the taste was so fun. We loved that it was a conversation piece, everyone wanted to discuss the pairings and compare the flavor profiles etc.   Price is right on point for the quality of product you will receive.",

It's very clear that the severes are required to know the cheeses they serve and are able to talk about them as well as give their own personal recommendations.

We had the charcuterie and cheese board which came with 3 cheeses, 2 meats and pairings. The bacon wrapped dates with cheese are crazy good. There is also a good selection of beer and wine at fair prices. They also have some market items to go.  The service is incredible. They were informative on the charcuterie selections and the food prep was fairly quick.  Would like it more if they had a larger to go beer and wine selection.",

The chicken salad tasted so fresh and it was served with arugula normally on a croissant, but they accommodated my request for sourdough. After a week in Savannah, I wanted a soup without cream and was I in luck!  They offered a vegetable soup for a small upcharge and it was well worth it.    My husband had the chipotle turkey bacon sandwich and I know he enjoyed it because his plate was perfectly clean. We can't wait to go back and have wine and cheese one cooler evening.  My husband, who is a music lover, noted that I must add that the playlist is the best in Charlotte.  In his words, he says it's straight \"FI-YA\"!!!!",

There are several different textures and flavors from the different olives and the herb oil is great drizzle on the bread with ricotta.  The ricotta had good flavor but was not as creamy as our last visit.  The charcuterie and cheese board is on another level. Each item has a perfect pairing and each is explained in detail as is the origins of each item.  The staff here is super friendly and amazingly knowledgeable about the meats and cheeses.  Next visit I really need to try a sandwich I saw many and they all looked delicious!",

They operate as a sandwich shop during the day and they run the same menu each day. They offer a variety of local beers, ciders and wine. They also have some desserts in addition to sandwiches and they sell local goods and products as well. On Thursday evenings they will put on a class program. I came here for a cheese tasting class with the Piedmont Culinary Guild. The owner was very knowledgeable about the different types of  cheeses. All of the cheeses we tasted were from NC creameries. They are the only Matthews based triple crown sustainability company in Charlotte.",

I had seen this place popping up nonstop on my IG feed with dozens of incredible pictures of charcuterie boards.   Being a huge fan I knew I had to test to see if the food was as good as the pictures and it definitely measured up. I got a medium sized charcuterie board (two meats and three cheeses) for $24- a well priced combo. I wish I had went with the big board however!  The place has a really cool vibe and posted outdoor seating, but the weather didn't permit us to sit outside. The place is a bit tight however and I can imagine it gets pretty cramped when full, so be sure to arrive prompt if you plan to show up during peak hours. Really friendly and knowledgeable staff!",

We were immediately greeted by its passionate owner, Chris, the moment we walked thru the door, and our waitress was equally friendly and attentive throughout our meal.   The Rockin' the Beets (with goat cheese) salad  was loaded with beef chunks and was easily substantial as a meal, as was the Fig and Pig. Both were priced at $9 and were very fresh and packed with quality ingredients. The housemade dressings were also fabulous.   We split a small Charcouterie and Cheese board including two cured meats, three cheeses, gourmet mustard and preserves, Spanish almonds and dried mango, all beautifully presented. It ran $23 and was a very tasty appetizer but could serve as a meal for light eaters. It is also their specialty. I also tried a gourmet grilled cheese and chips for $8.   Like everything else it was exceptional! The atmosphere inside and out was comfortable, light and airy. Everything was immaculate. I give it out many 5-star ratings but this is one. Can't wait to return!",

It's a very cute little place with bar seating, a couple tables, and outdoor seating. I sat at the long community table. They have lots of local wines and brews from Asheville to Southern Pines as well as canned items like Mexican coke and ginger ale. I had sweet tea and it was just the right amount of sugar. Once I saw muffuletta that was it for me. Along side I wanted the mixed greens with that tomato basil dressing. It def didn't look like a typical muffuletta but the taste was BANGING! The service was just amazing also. I really felt like I was at home. What I thought would be a really good salad ended up being mouth watering with that tomato basil dressing. I finished most everything and got to go what I didn't. Later on I will be trying the lemon cream cake because I just couldn't resist leaving with out something sweet. Thank you Loyalist that was an amazing lunch!!",

I loved it so much I kept coming back.   Then, these past three visits when I've raved about The Loyalist to friends. The service was terrible. We had to ask for everything we needed or track another server down to help us a couple of times.   Tonight, I noticed a couple leave while waiting for our table. My friend and I were trying to paying our check to give them the table, but the server did not check on us. The couple left.  I'm writing this review because I want people to not leave due to poor service. I love The Loyalist...location, food, and I hope to love the service again.",

    "text": "After seeing some amazing photos of their Charcuterie Trays, I immediately bookmarked The Loyalist Market in Yelp, joined their Instagram and Facebook accounts and counted down until my visit.  A quaint shop in Matthews, The Loyalist Market provides outstanding service, unique dishes and some of the best Charcuterie I have ever had.  This market offers customers the ability to order meats and cheeses/sandwiches to go, a menu if you'd like to dine in and a bar to boot. I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon only to realize there was a ham sandwich and mimosa special. Although the ham sandwich, on a homemade biscuit, looked and sounded amazing I had to go with a Charcuterie Tray on my first visit. And, it did not disappoint.  The Tray came with two meats and three cheeses, crostini and some accompaniments. They lay the Tray out so you use each accompaniment with the appropriate cheese, perfection! I honestly can say that the way they pair things really makes you appreciate the taste of the cheese. Hats off to them.  This is a stop that I would highly recommend if you like Charcuterie, great service and a quaint location!",

    "text": "The area where the market is located has grown up quite a bit over the years - so it is quite impressive that it has gone from, well, nothing, to being a chain or two, to actually having some reasonable choices.  As to the market itself - it is a bit disjointed as you enter, but the staff is friendly and can help you out. This mostly stems from it depending on when you enter, and we came just as they were switching over. If you are there a bit earlier, you get something at the counter (the \"market\"), and then go grab a seat - or take your stuff to go.  If you come later, for more of a dinner experience perhaps, then you will sit and be waited upon, in more of a traditional experience. Though it's not quite traditional, because you aren't sitting in a restaurant or anything. It's more like you're a part of the market itself. There are a couple of tables and a larger, shared table.  Said staff mills about, so you may be helped by several people, who get your drinks and bring whatever you will order throughout your stay. The more interesting choices are likely to be the meat and cheese options - what is probably most unique is that you don't have a bunch of input other than the number. A couple next to us ordered the exact same thing, and other than some bread, I am not sure they had anything on their tray that was the same as ours. Most looked a lot different.  You may also want to stay away from the web site, specifically if you are looking for something specific on your tray. While they may carry, say, some cheese from time to time, the very nature of seasonal cheeses means it may not be there on your visit. This isn't bad, and doesn't mean what you get will be bad - just don't be surprised is all.  Other items, such as sandwiches and the like, aren't likely to change much, but be honest - the cheese and meat trays are where it's at.",

    "text": "I had brunch here on Sunday March 24th with my sister in law and two girlfriends... we had mimosas, a cheese board, and salads on the patio to celebrate a lovely Sunday morning!  We were early, so we just loitered on the patio... the second they opened, the staff came out with water and menus to ask what we'd like... They were super kind and made us feel right at home!  I'm sure, had we not had to drive, we'd have spent all afternoon day-drinking in that pretty place!!  The cheeseboard was a spectacle of delicious cheeses and meats paired with jams, honeys, dried fruits, and nuts.  We really enjoyed how knowledgeable they were about their cheese and charcuterie!  I also got the Fig & Pig salad... a delight of salty and sweet natural flavors... I can't wait to get back here!! :)",

Incredible selection of meat and cheese for the boards and the environment is awesome to just sit and eat with a group. Also, if you get a chance to try their mac n cheese on Tuesdays, just do it. So so good!",

My husband loves the Chipotle turkey sandwich. We have had charcuterie boards there and order them to go, they're always amazing. The $5 mimosas are great on Sundays. I highly recommend this establishment.",
