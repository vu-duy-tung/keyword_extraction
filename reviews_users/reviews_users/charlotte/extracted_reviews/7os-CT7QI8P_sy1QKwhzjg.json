    "text": "Dont waste your time coming here.  We have been a couple times now...Each time saying we will give it one more chance.  That in itself shouldn't be the way you approach a restaurant.  Well tonight was the last straw.  We got there at 7:15 and no one was there to greet the line of people waiting at the front door.  The place was packed.  We waited about 10 minutes to even be seated.  It took 20 minutes to get our drink orders in/acknowledge we had been seated, then probably another 20-30 minutes to even get those drinks.  Got our food order in and a few minutes after the same waitress that took our order asked us if we had ordered yet!  We had to go to the bar to order more drinks because no one came by to check on us.  We also had to check on the food to make sure that was even put in to the system.  It was 8:45 at this time and we had not even received our food yet!  When the food came everyone's order was right except for one person.  Ordered 3 tacos and only one came out.  We had to get up and ask for the bill because no one came to check on us...Again.  When the bill came it was all wrong.  They posted on NextDoor app stating Taco Tuesday with drink and food specials...That's not what was on the bill.  The one taco alone was $8!  2 hours at a mediocre place on a Tuesday is definitely not worth it.  We were even the last ones in there(not by choice) and they still had awful service.  The worst part of it all was no apology or anything.  The server, Pepe, just laughed after we told him what the night looked like.  He just pointed a finger at the original waitress that served us.  I don't recommend coming here.  There is another Mexican food restaurant, Los Arcos, next to Harris Teeter, maybe 2 miles down the road and they have been spot on every time we go.",

Our waitress was very nice and friendly.  We got a pitcher of margaritas, which were delicious--not too sweet/syrupy!  He got enchiladas and I got a taco--both were fresh and scrumptous.  I really appreciated being able to order just one taco (plus rice and beans), since most restaurants require you to get 3 or more per meal.  (NOTE: you can order three tacos as well!)  Basically: the food was fresh and tasty, the service was friendly and tasteful, the restaurant itself is clean and beautifully decorated.  We will be back!",

We started with drinks-Texas size margaritas for them, a peach margarita for the wife and I tried the homemade sangria. All drinks were good and the sangria was not to sweet as some can be. For dinner my wife  ordered a veggie quesadilla and the rest of us got Tacos De Brisket which was shredded beef brisket with a great grilled flavor served in warm flour tortillas with pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and shredded lettuce for toppings. Its was also served with rice and beans, The rice was ok, the beans were bland and needed more seasoning. Where this place lost points was the service. it seemed like we did not have a specific server, just who ever was walking by the table. We had to flag down some one several times and the busier they got, the slower the service got. We asked for take out boxes that never came, so my sister's boyfriend had to go get them. Overall, the food and drinks were good albeit higher priced than other Mexican restaurants in the area. The service, at least on the night we visited, leaves a lot to be desired. The food and drinks are worth a return visit, but at the higher prices if the service does not improve on the second visit, there will be no third.",

They weren't super warm but they got the job done for us but I could see issues popping up as they get busier.  The food though is pretty darn good for the price.  I hate qualifying opinions but I am going to do it anyways.  I grew up and lived in cali for 30 years. Yes this place wont have the seafood dishes and lighter fare but for the heavier down home cooking its a-ok.  Margaritas aren't fancy but they are the classic ones I would get for cheap in the down home spots I would go to in Tustin or Santa Ana.  If you want fancy, trendy or light food this is not the spot. If you want good down home Mexican at a fair price with good enough service give it a shot.",

    "text": "I go out to eat lunch almost 5 days a week.  I think servers and restaurant workers have a tough job and i am normally a 20% tipper.  If i think the service is lacking, i might go down to 15% - 12%.  I like the food here, that is not why i am displeased...I walked in slightly early for lunch...11:15ish.  The manager(maybe owner) walks me to a table right next to the only other people eating in the restaurant, and the floor had just been mopped with a strong smelling cleaner.  I asked to sit somewhere else where the floor was not wet.  He tells me to sit where ever i like then \"explains\" to me that the floor is always wet early and if i want a dry floor i should have come in after 12:30.  Somehow I pissed him off with my request...Ok...whatever.  I find a seat in a dryer section and wait for my friend.  chips salsa, and a tea...nothing bad.  friend arrives, we order.  server is a different guy (I think maybe another manager/owner since he was dressed business casual) I ask for a torta but i don't want fries, i would like beans instead.  (FYI I have made this substitution about 5 times prior to this particular visit with no issues).  the server tells me no substitutions \"Only Fries\".  Then tells me beans will be extra.  I say, \"OK I still want beans\".  Walks away from me speaking in Spanish to the manager.  We wait.  Chips empty, never brought more.  Then our food comes out. Friend has everything, I have just a sandwich.  So i wait to see if the beans are coming out next.  Friend ends up asking if my beans were coming out soon.  The server said \"no, it's extra\".  He then becomes combative with us about how I said \"no\" to the beans.  back and forth for a while, so i say, don't worry about the beans the torta is enough.  He then starts speaking Spanish across the restaurant to the manager as he is standing at our table and walks away.  That is all we see from him.  No checking on the food or if we wanted anything else.  The manager who was annoyed earlier comes back with checks.  Now i tip on service...I was not about to tip this guy 20% for his \"work\" and being a gracious host.  I paid the check in cash and left the guy the change that was left from my bill.  You may disagree with that, but I was unhappy with the service and that is why people tip.  The amount i left was obviously unsatisfactory to the manager because he follows me out and tells me i need the money more than him and drops it on the ground in front of me.  He then tells me that he doesn't want me to come back in anymore.    It's a shame because the options are limited on this part of town, and again, i like the food.  I wont be going back and if you want to support someone who cares about customer service, you shouldn't go to La Fiesta Grande.",

I had the Texas Burrito with grilled shrimp, steak and chicken.  The shrimp were plentiful, and tasty, not overcooked.  The steak and chicken both were well seasoned.  My wife had a veggie chimi, which we had not seen before, and some sangria.  She was very happy with both items.  Lastly, my Mother-in-Law had a grilled chicken quesadilla, which looked great, loaded full of chicken.  The service was good, but I can see that if they were super busy the wait staff could get overloaded.  I'm hoping they are a success.",

There was 1 family guy working for 5-6 tables and he was very short and never asked how things were the entire time. They first brought out the wrong plate for my son and 10min went by without him even saying a word or even an apology so we had no idea if they were correcting it or when to expect it to even come out.

    "text": "While perusing through yelp, relentlessly as if I'm going to find a new restaurant in the area, I read the reviews about this place with high hopes to eat some great Mexican not too far from my home. To my surprise, contrary to past reviews I've read about this place,there were some positive reviews about the service and management change. Poor management is why I had avoided this place in the past. Being from the west coast, I consider myself a Mexican food cone suer and only having been in Charlotte for a few years. It been a real challenge finding authentic food that lives up to my expectations and has good service. To my surprise, I was politely greeted and seated near immediately following my arrival at the hostess podium. Now the food... AMAZING (to say the least). Salsa as a starter was fresh, robust, and flavorful, and certainly beats the tomato sauce based salsa that restaurants serve, the chips were warm. I was excited because if the salsa was any indication of the food I was about to be blessed. So maybe 10 mins after sitting and enjoying my chips and salsa, my plate arrived. I order combo #1 A, 2 enchiladas (1 beef, 1 chicken) and rice . EVERYTHING WAS flavorful, fresh, and deliciously seasoned....AMAZING . I'm kicking myself from not getting here sooner! The service was great also! DO NOT WAIT TO EAT HERE, you will regret it!  and no my reviews are never this long.",

    "text": "Ok this may sound like a rambling but here we go We just arrived home from the beach and needed to go to the grocery store Instead as I was going thru the mail I read the article about giving La Fiesta Grande a second chance. We pull in and notice how nice it is on the patio. We sit down and enjoy our chips and salsa. As soon as our food is delivered it is like attack of the flies. Bees start swarming us. The waiter apologizes blaming the BP. We eat in a hurry while the busboy swats flies with a fly swatter. The waiter asks if we need to go boxes and I said no thank you, there were many flies on the food. Next thing I know, two managers come up to me and ask me whAt is wrong. I mention that I did not want to go boxes and they respond that we could of eaten inside awY from the flies. Next thing I know the managers friends  who are sitting behind me tell me I should have eaten inside that I am obviously not an outdoor person. The discussion continues and I end up in tears while wearing my be positive hat!!! Anyway I am posting to let you know that I do not recommend the Mexican restaurant next to the BP at Mountain Island. Please share with Mtn island neighbors. I really would not grant this any stars but with yelp you have to at least give one.",

Like why are you in customer service? We ordered an appetizer, beer and split a quesadilla plate. We still had a ton of chips left (because that little thing of salsa doesn't go far) and asked for an additional salsa so that we could finish our chips with and he charged us for extra. Like I can see if someone only ordered one plate and was tearing through some salsa but come on we had an app and beer and asked for ONE additional tiny salsa which probably only cost them .50. So over that they lost two regular customers. You treat your customers right and they will continue come back to you. They must be really hurting for business if they have to pinch every penny out of you.",

    "text": "Mediocre food, terrible service! I keep telling myself I won't got back but because it's convenient we some how found ourselves here 2-3 times a year in hopes it gets better. This time with only 4 booths filled in the whole restaurant at 6pm on a Saturday night and three servers, the story was no different. Waitress struggled to take our simple order, coming back to the table 4 times to ask questions about our order. She didn't know the drink specials and had to ask somebody else. The margarita was watered down so I paid and ordered an additional shot of tequila to add to it which I didn't get until our food was out and the drink was nearly gone. Had to ask for drinks and practically pre-bus our own table to clear up room. Food came out wrong which we mentioned but we just picked out the onions. They had vulgar cursing rap music blaring and I had my three young kids with me, mind you it's 6pm not 10pm.  Do yourself a favor and choose somewhere else.",

My boyfriend ordered a platter that had steak, shrimp and chicken with rice(I can't remember the name). My meal was not that great. I'm not a fan of shredded chicken there was water/liquid coming out of my quesadilla. However, my boy friends meal was delicious! Everything season to perfection, hot and it was a nice sized portion.   The second time I came, I came only to socialize and drink. I ordered chicken wings(I know it's frowned upon, lol) and to drink I offered a margarita. The margaritas were delicious and the chicken wings were tasty as well. I liked that they had a band that night and the lady singing really included the crowd. It was not only entertaining but fun!",

Went there and instead of waiting 15-20 mins for water and chips we were served immediately, dinner was good and service not bad either. Since then I have been back 3 times and the service is on point and fast, food is good and quick and the vibe is different, plus it's a good place to take the family or large groups! I definitely recommend this place now that it has new management/owners.",

    "text": "So this is my second time here and I'm sad to write a poor review, however the reason why I'm writing this instead of dining on delicious Mexican cuisine is that we literally haven't seen our waiter to tell him to bring us the check for this cheese dip in the 30 mins we've been sitting here.   My first experience was average but today is crazy. I don't know if they're short staffed or what but there's 1 bartender, 1 bus boy, and 1 waiter. There's an elderly woman who brought us chips and salsa but THE waiter has been zooming all over the restaurant. After waiting so long we basically finished the chips the waiter brought us two waters with no ice and 15 mins later comes zooming over and exclaimed \"you know what you want yet?!\"   Trying not to get annoyed we ordered the Fiesta Dip. 15 mins later he slides it onto the table and leaves before we can say a word! The dip is literally so watery it won't stay on the tortilla! Then he comes back at some point and asks if we're ready to order. As politely as I could I said \"it seems you're short staffed and unable to accommodate us so we'll just stay with the appetizer. He walks off without even acknowledging what I had just said. I thought that the cheese just needed to cool but no, it's basically water. So we wait...and wait...and wait...and wait.   Finally he comes back and I asked for the check. I showed him the dip and he literally started trying to count the shrimp. I told him that I ate 1, which I did. He then proceeds to charge 1/2 price for it. Now we're not hard up for cash just so we're clear. But the principle is why I'm annoyed. He did not care that he'd given poor service. He didn't care when I told him I was writing this. This restaurant will not get another dime from me.",

Waitress polite but just not competent in the kitchen at all. I ordered hot Yucatan shrimp which was to come with rice and beans, habeneros, onions, tomatoes, guacamole and mushrooms.   The kitchen prepared FRENCH Fries with shrimp only after an hour and a half wait?  We were the only table in the place!  Me wife ordered Guadalajara Salad which was to be served with guacamole... again what came was not even close. Carrots and cabbage salad is what came.  All orders completely off base.  Wow! I did not know what to say??  Sadly nothing has really changed here.    The Chicago Cubs curse has been transferred to this geographical locale. Vinnie's-you could not get silverware.  Biker sports bar with scantily clad waitresses. Mexican Place where the owners were rude and incompetent. The tradition of rudeness is gone but incompetence  continues.  I'd be happier with sausage prepared by Sweeney Todd at this point.   Is the restaurant built on a Native American cemetery?   Suggestion: Raise the place and start completely over.  All joking aside I feel awful for our waitress.  She was polite and trying hard.   To her credit she discounted our tab but nothing about this establishment is redeeming.  She needs to work in a place with more competent kitchen staff.   STAY AWAY!",

I feel the description was misleading and I needed some pasta. Anyhow, hubs had the asada tacos, really good taste on the meat and it comes with onions and cilantro. Please do not ask for a side of cheese, sour cream or guacamole. A small side of gauc was $5.25 as it only comes in small or large and a plastic cup of shredded cheese was a $1. Maybe there is a fee for messing with the cooks original recipe. Service was good, more than one person stopped to check on us throughout but $50 for subpar food?!? I likely won't return.",

Even the rice, which seems to have sat for the better part of the day at most Mexican restaurants was fresh. With mole not at many restaurants I quickly ordered the enchilada mole with chicken. Very good. The enchilada wasn't smothered in mole which is most always the case. My wife really liked her burrito as well. Very nice patio area where we enjoyed the warm eGood salsa.

    "text": "We have been here three times and every time the food and service has gone slightly down. The first time it was excellent. My youngest still says his enchilada kids meal is his favorite of all time, even in this third visit and after going to probably over thirty different Mexican restaurants. The fajitas texicana are really good. The burito my husband got was small and looked like an enchilada. The burito my son got was good also. The service has gone down. The server we had this time seemed bothered that we were there at first. I had to go to the bar to get more salsa and chips. After that the wait staff all pitched in and made great efforts to ensure we had what we needed. And the server did make more effort but then we felt guilty for the extra effort. If you are looking for descent food and service this is a good choice, just don't expect to be wowed.",

    "text": "This is the third time we have tried this Restarunt and I am pleased to say the food was quite good and very plentiful. We had tea to drink and there was a small problem keeping the glasses full even though our server had plenty of time to chat on her cell phone while on the floor. I'm not sure if this was her first day as she didn't pay attention until I spoke up. Which I did a couple times. The wife never did get a refill of tea so I shared my second glass with her. Also it bothered me a little when she took my glass and straw away to refill it.  Then almost dumped it on me when she returned it. Only one more thing to mention and I'm not sure if Yelp or the Restarunt will be affected. Yelp has a coupon for a free small cheese dip on the Restarunt web site. Our server had never seen this before so she took my phone to ask the manager. When she came back she asked me to show it to her again when I got the bill. No idea why she couldn't remember this.   Even though I have spent a lot of this review on service I must admit it was the best their food has ever been.  I wish them well and might try them Anson as they are very close to our home. But there are 4 Mexican Restaurants and at this time they are number 3.",
