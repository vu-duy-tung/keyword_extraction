    "text": "I've eaten at a lot of Chipotles in California and I never reviewed them because they were so common.  I'll make an exception for Charlotte :)  Chipotle is a winning concept - fresh and accessible.  It gives you a pseudo healthy feeling and options (if you really want to be healthy).  It is not at all authentic, but it is tasty.  The assembly line, Subway-esque, made-to-order line works.  The menu is simple, choose your entree (burrito, bowl, taco) and your protein, the rest is entirely up to you.  I recommend the burrito bowl with tortillas on the side (so much food and this way you can wrap what you can't eat) or the tacos (3 to an order).  Their carnitas (shredded pork) is always moist.  I'm not a fan of their chicken, which has a fake smoked flavor.  Pile on plenty of corn salsa (the best!), a bit of sour cream and lettuce and you are good to go.  Seating at Chipotles is always kind of uncomfortable, varnished plywood and steel doesn't make for comfy seating.  Get it to go and have a meal for two days if you get the burrito bowl.",

    "text": "A burrito a day kept the ramen away when I was an undergrad in California. Not only was Chipotle delicious, but also a great value.   Yet, as I keep coming to this location, I keep being underwhelmed.   Burritos, once $5ish, are now in the $6-7 range.  That $1.75 plastic cup of  guacamole, once bursting at the seams, is now filled by an air bubble (this isn't a bag of chips!!!)  The chips seem stale and not as lemony-salty as they should be.  The chicken is usually a miss, being over-seasoned and over-cooked.  My final straw was getting a part of a plastic bag along with my barbacoa o, which I discovered in my mouth. Yum.    I still love Chipotle, but this location needs to improve its quality if you expect people to pay your increasing prices. I'll be back to check, but I am not going to hold my breath.",

    "text": "Chipotle is awesome; however this is the single worst location I have ever been to, which is why the rating is so low. I eat at chipotle all the time, but will never ever go back to this location.   Food: The staff (which are quite nice at least) never manage to make a decent taco. For example, everytime I order tacos with salsa, they put a dot in the middle of the taco, and I either have to ask them to correct it, or spread it on the taco myself. They also give maybe 50% of the meat any other Chipotle does. I would think a chain wouldn't vary this much with the amount of food you receive, but obviously that assumption would be wrong.   Interior: Interior is terrible as well. All the tables are so close to each other it is impossible to not be enveloped in other peoples conversations. I often can hear the people sitting at the table next to me louder than the person across from me at my own table. Not because they are so loud, but because the tables are set up so poorly that I'm actually closer to them than the person I'm eating with!! Oh and the seating also holds like 1/10th of the people who come in on the average lunch. You might get lucky, but don't expect to be able to get a table the vast majority of the time at lunch.  Parking: Parking is absolutely terrible. The parking lot is tiny tiny tiny, spots are all small (which means very very often people park over the dividing line), and you'll often see people parking down the street in the apartment complex, or at the shopping center beside Chipotle. Horrible planning.   Staff: Can't complain about the staff. Granted, they can't make a decent taco to save their life, but they are always generally polite and nice.",

For a while they were separated as a result of my initial complaints against them, but now their Sofritas (tofu) is right next to their chicken. It needs to be next to the vegetables and away from all meats so that no chicken will get into the Vegan Sofritas containers. Us Vegans don't want to eat meat! They also need to move the guacamole away from the cheese because Vegans don't eat cheese! They've accidentally spilled cheese and chicken into vegetable product containers. This has happened at this particular Chipotle location and several others I've been To around Charlotte. They also need to stop being sloppy in their food preparation!",

It makes me feel good about not just eating delicious and a lot of it, but also from a company that is trying to be environmentally friendly. On each cup there is a story about one of their products or how they do something in the company...it's fun to read.   The staff there are very friendly! I was a bit surprised at how helpful and friendly they were as I was going down the assembly line for my burrito. It has indoor and outdoor seating to suit all types as well. You can even order online so it's ready when you get there.  Great food and great service! I'm a fan.",

But as of the last year, it seems every time I go in for a chicken salad, the chicken (and sometimes fajita veggies) is completely charred and they forget to give me the dressing that follows the salad along the assembly line. I don't know what they're doing with the dressing or if the bagger is a magician on the side but I swear they put it in and then I get back to the office and it's not in there. Ugh! I'm not going to drive back for Pete's sake so then I'm stuck with a burned, bland salad. Shame on me for not checking every. single. time. Now I do but I'm a slow learner. But I also have converted from an almost weekly customer to a once every 4 months visitor. Can we go into a time machine to 2014 when your food was always good? Of course the positive that came out of the E Coli scare is it's a lot easier to find a parking space in the precarious parking lot full of aggressive burrito zombies!",

I was, however, pleasantly surprised at how quickly the staff kept things moving.  The food has always been good - not amazing but never disappointing.  I'm also a supporter of Chipotle as a company because they put effort into purchasing meats/produce from ethical and sustainable farms.  They are also very vegetarian friendly for those of you who opt out of eating meat.    I'd give Chipotle 3.5 stars.  I'd definitely head back, but wouldn't go out of my way to get there.",

The chicken is tasty, moist and tender. I usually get the salad (sans dressing as it is caloric!) and get a side of one of their yummy salsas for dressing.   So until a real Mexican establishment finds its way to Charlotte, I will stick with you my new friend. Thank you.",

Given all the Chipotles I've visited and burritos I've eaten over the past decade, I used to be frustrated with the South Boulevard location. Some of the employees weren't nice and they hadn't really mastered the art of rolling a burrito. But things have improved greatly there.   I'm pretty loyal to the chicken burrito bol, but everything there is good. If you're trying to keep things healthier, go for a salad and avoid the sour cream and cheese.",

The server asked what ingredients I wanted, and they were just placed on top of each other. She did not know how to fold the flour tortilla, like folding paper. I also had some guacamole and it was bland. I brought it home, and added salt, pepper, cayenne, lemon juice, and chopped garlic. So much better.

Really!? When I balked at the price I was told \"avocados are expensive\" - ok, yes, they are about a dollar a piece- so I am buying the equivalent of two avocados??? I don't think so.   You do not have ground beef? Wow...what the heck so now I am paying $8 for the same burrito I get at Salsaritas for $5 and now I cannot even have the type of meat I prefer? Man. So I went with the marinaded chicken. Lets just say I am glad I went and splurged the almost two dollars for Guac because that chicken was way overly seasoned - and way too spicy.   I will say the burrito was very large - so if you don't like Guac then $5 is a rocking deal. Also, I preferred the rice to other establishments. Unfortunately due to my preference for all things Guacamole I wont be coming back.   Please Salsaritas- invest in an uptown location ...(they do not have frivolous upcharges : ) )",

Not only the love that I have for this establishment and company as a whole, but the love that is put into each and every burrito I've ever eaten from Chipotle.  I've been to this particular Chipotle about three or four times, and I have never been let down.  I would also like to mention that about once every other week, my gf brings me carryout from Chipotle. Thanks hun!!  I have never had a sub-par meal or Chipotle experience.  My go to is the grilled steak burrito.  I've been to burrito joints all over this town, from Qdoba, to Johnny Burrito to Salsaritas, and I've yet to taste steak that is on the same level as Chipotle.  Its tender, juicy and full of flavor.  I usually like to go with the black beans and all the fixins they can pile into one monster burrito.  I must mention their guacamole.  I'm always sure to add guac to my burrito.  I will say that there is a slight up charge to add guac but their guac is filled with such greeny goodness that the up charge it totally irrelevant!    Just about every time my gf and I go to Chipotle, we are sure to get an order of the chips and guac as a side item.  Not only are the chips always fresh and crisp, but you can never get to much of the guacamole from this place.  I mean do they fly the avocados in fresh daily from Mexico??    The service is always great here at Chipotle.  They are always quick and efficient.  My order has always been made exactly as I've requested.  The actual inside of the establishment is always clean and tidy.  So I guess its all a matter of what you LOVE in life?  If you LOVE good, tasty, filling, food, then there's really only one place to go, one place to fall in LOVE with - CHIPOTLE!",

Waiting on food that ran out about 10 minutes ago when there were no customers waiting on line to be served. This was stated by the team members themselves as I watched them discuss it for about 3 minutes before getting steak and fajita on the grill. Not the first time I had to sit and wait on food at this location. No sense of urgency seems to take place. Kind of sucks. The three stars also is a result of the overly seasoned fajitas I received before. It ruined my bowl completely. Way to salty. Other than that the team members always seem to have a smile on their faces and they're always very excited. They also took care of the issue. That I do appreciate.",

They even gave me a side of medium salsa without a charge.  Staff was very friendly, welcoming and accommodating! My only negative would be seating. Restaurant is small, but the tables are secured down so you had to share with others. I was by myself and got one end of a 6 top table while 2 women and a baby were at the other end.  I will definitely be back! If you are in the mood for a quick delicious Mexican meal, I highly recommend Chipotle!",

    "text": "I decided to give this place a try because its literally a half block from my salon and the people at Mr.K start to remember my order since I eat there so much in one week. I absolutely regretted it. I remember Chipotle burrito was alway so massive which make me over eat due to not wanting to waste food. But I swore there's an option for regular size or small size burrito. Well I was wrong. I ordered the steak burrito. The guy behind the counter suggested adding cheese to it since the steaks are a little spicy. Umm I don't do spicy so I listen to him and add cheese.  What got me soo perturbed was that he was so busy flirting with me by asking me a ton of non related burrito questions that I feel like he man handle my food. He slap more than enough black beans on my burrito, throw very little cheese in, didn't distribute the ingredients evenly so when he tried to roll it, it tore apart. After he rolled it, saw the disgusted look on my face, ask if I refer a tortilla to be wrap OVER THE original burrito, meanwhile trying to tuck all the over flowing ingredients under the roll so I don't see it. Really??!!  Another employee saw my face, he tried to save the situation but its beyond saving.  The burrito was ok. It is spicy and the little cheese that was in there didn't help. I will definitely try Chipotle again. However, I will not go back to this location. I truly believe food should look pretty. We eat with our eyes first. But this didn't happen here.",

Top that sucker with some beans, cheese and sour cream and I am all set. The place is very clean, modern and staff is quick to make a burrito and always so sweet. Another plus, they were playing The Killers when I went in this past time. Burrito and Brandon Flowers?? Bring it!

As a lifelong salesperson, I eat on the road often, well a lot, so I can pretty much tell you the nutrition facts of most chains, which led me here in the first place-4 stars!  Also, when I'm working from home, sometimes I just need to get out for a meal to see some other living, breathing people and this is where I go.  First, it's super quick, you can be in and out if here in no time! Second, it's healthy. All the food is made fresh, right behind the counter, and they are one of the few chains who use hormone/antibiotic free meat and organic produce when possible...hard to find today when everyone is trying to save a dime. Lastly, the staff always greets you with a smile, asks you about your day and says hello and goodbye (one thing this Philly girl never takes for granted).   So if you're looking for a quick and healthy meal, this is the place.  My two favs are the chicken burrito bowl and the crunchy tacos.",

Their menu and ingredients are simple and not too complex.  Sure, you may not get a variety, but at least they know what they are doing as far as what they do provide.    My usual go to is a chicken bowl, white rice, pinto beans, chicken, medium salsa, corn, guacamole, and lettuce.  When they are out of guac, I usually go the cheese route... but you can't go wrong.  Depending on if there is a line, (usually there is) you can get your food and be eating within 5min which is great.  This location has parking in the back - off of a busy South Blvd, I'm sure they are not hurting for business with all the other shops around this location.  Just be careful when you pull out of the parking lot due to the Chipotle food comma you WILL receive (it's just a matter of time).",

Great staff. The girl who put the toppings on my burrito was super happy and really excited. I know that some of her enthusiasm rubbed off on me and improved what was already a good mood.

You might catch them on a good day...you might catch them on a bad day.   I came here the other week and I was quite impressed. I went with my usual burrito, except this time I was extremely hungry and  felt like I was up for a challenge. I loaded up on pretty much every add on they offered - the helpings were generous. I also went with double chicken. Make sure they scoop you're first serving of chicken before you ask for double meat. Don't let them compromise the size of each protein serving by speaking too soon.   I was prepared for a challenge and I was ready to take that burrito down. However, I was concerned that who ever had to wrap my burrito wouldn't be prepared for a challenge of their own...resulting in my burrito quickly become a burrito bowl.  Boy was I surprised...the young lady's burrito wrapping skills were exceptional..!! This woman had the hands of an angel. It took a few extra pieces of aluminum foil, but she got the job done! I wish I could shake her fathers hand and say, \"well done sir\"!  I can't promise that you guys will run into the same angel next time you guys stop in for a burrito at this particular location.

Food taste - I hardly had any complaints with respect to food quality or taste at chipotle, other than that one time when the rice was not fully cooked and the infamous E.Coli virus incident.   The portion size is just as you wish or just when you say 'stop' or '1 scoop is enough' or 'skip fajitas please' or something like that.  food tastes fresh, we usually get burrito bowls with either chicken or tofu. Chicken is awesome tasty and so is the hot salsa.  we usually don't buy chips and not sure about the chips.  overall the food is good, sumptuous, tasty and hopefully organic, non-GMO, non-MSG as they say in their website.",

There is no soy, not even oil, in anything except for the tofu and even that is organic.  While most other assembly line burrito places have cut back on the nickel and diming, Chipotle still does it and it can get expensive quick.  They charge almost $2 for guacamole on a burrito and you only have the option of cheese or sour cream (you have to pay extra if you want both).  Add a drink onto that and you're looking at $13 dollars for a burrito, chips, and a drink.  The cheese is also mozzarella which just doesn't go well with burritos.  The rest of the add-ons are limited compared to other similar style places  The chicken is grilled fresh; however, the charred taste is too much and leaves it with a burnt flavor.  The place also needs a makeover.  While the sanitation grade is good, the soda fountain are a was a little messy and the floors were dirty and cracked.  The place could use a refresh to make it a little brighter.    I appreciate the non-GMO component of Chipotle, however I think the flavor of the food and the lack of fillings misses the mark slightly.",

I stopped in last night, the store was pretty empty which was a bonus for me, first class service. I got my usual, chicken bowl, add one spoonful of steak with all the fixings...seriously add all the toppings you have salsa, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream and lettuce and then add guacamole. Please and Thanks!  It was fast, the service was great and as usual my food tasted great.   Mmmm....Chipotle!",

Something is wrong with the management.  The past two visits, something hasn't been ready or they've been out of an ingredient. The first trip, they were out of Pico and the second trip they were out of all tortillas...How can a burrito place be out of tortillas??? I don't get it?

About three times out of four there's something not correct: out of a key ingredient (rice, beans, chicken, cheese... something basic) or something weird going on with the staff or management (unprofessional or just weird interactions). It wouldn't take much to make this location a great experience 99% of the time, instead of only 25% of the time.  **Since originally posting a two star review I have stopped eating Chipotle. And this deeply pains me. I can see why they were in the news for food born illnesses. Hygiene is just not a top priority. The foil lids were bring restocked up front, the worker took so many that the top one was braced with her face. Her face was touching the lid. I kept waiting for her to throw away the $.003 lid that was touching her face. I walked out of line when I saw it being used on a customer's order.",

There were four people in line when we walked in, and it took close to 15 minutes for us to get to the front. It appeared as though one of the employees was training, right in the middle of the dinner rush. By the time we placed our order, we looked behind us and the line was out the door - nearly 15+ people were there and there was absolutely no urgency from the employees. They were messing around with each other and laughing, while their neglected patrons stood in line, patiently. I'm not saying a work environment has to be extremely strict, however, make sure your customers are taken care of first. Once we finally made it out of Chipotle and ate at home - our chicken was on fire - SO spicy. As I have said before, we come here often, and know how the chicken should taste (my tongue is still burning). Tonight we had a poor experience with the customer service AND the food. It would be nice if the management could take this matter into their hands and train their employees on the importance of urgency (especially during lunch/dinner rushes), etiquette, respect, attention to detail, work ethic, and communication. Until then, we'll be heading to a different location.",

Maybe when Chipotle did the mass hiring they got a wave of fresh energy? Maybe it is because I now sneak out of the office to take this thing called a \"lunch break\" and the afternoon crew is more chipper? Either way Chipotle - shut up and take my money.  Two major improvements have occurred in the last few months. First - they are no longer out of items. Perhaps my last review was the last of the supply chain issues because the delicious option bar has been well stocked since. Except for carnitas, but the news says no one in NC is servicing carnitas right now so they get a pass.  The second improvement is much more important to me - they strain the ingredients before packing up my burrito. That means NO MORE SOGGY BURRITOS. That's really all I ever want in life - a delicious fresh burrito without any liquid morphing the tortilla.   The thing I truly love about Chipotle and why I will take them above all other burrito joints (and I have branched out and tried a few!) is that they season their ingredients. Something so simple yet so few places do it. I swear the competition boils the chicken and rice and stuffs it in a burrito. That cilantro lime rice is the best and I normally pass on rice. The chicken retains the fresh grilled taste. And when you put this and many other things in a soft tortilla it is absolute perfection.",

Having worked in customer service for 10 years and currently in sales management, I know a thing or two. One thing I know for certain is that the customer service at this location SUCKS!   -Two of the crew members were having an inappropriate conversation (something about lesbians) -The young lady that prepared my order did not greet me, just asked for my order...yes, uh hello to you too! -There was absolutely NO ORDER, crew members walking to and from the register with customers waiting and not saying anything.  -The icing on the cake was when I went up to the counter to ask for lids to put on my bowls. She tosses one on the counter \"There's one.\" She goes to get the second one and I'm holding my hand out at this point because had she tossed that second one...I had to catch myself, you ALWAYS hand the customer what they asked for.   I'll never visit this location again, EVER. I liked coming here because I enjoy eating outside, but I won't spend my money where I can't even get decent service. Today totally turned me off ;(",

I was so upset but I still got to chipotle because I was like well maybe I can eat this without corn but to me it's like eating a potato without butter just can't do it. I called another Chipotle with 10 minutes to spare before I got there and I I asked if they had any corn and the lady answered the phone with so much grace and enthusiasm and she say yes we have some corn! She said I'm going to put two sides of corn to the side for you. As I was speeding down the highway to make it to the Chipotle before they close I ran it with four minutes to spare and she handed me my corn and I tried to give her some money she said no just write a good review on yelp all (hope that did get her in trouble) but you know. Here I am keeping my word. Thank you for the corn and I appreciate it.",

    "text": "The worst Chipotle location I have ever been to, hands down. The service is eh, the food is never ready & requires some kind of wait, & the line is always long (hmmm I wonder if this has to do with waiting for food....).   I stopped in around dinner time on a Thursday. First off, they were \"out\" of white rice. Last time I checked, being out of something means you don't have it at all. Staff then tells me it'll be 10 minutes, so I opt for brown rice. I'm going down the line & everything is all dandy until they tell me once again that they are \"out\" of guacamole. I think to myself hmm they don't have any guacamole in the entire building. I'm a little pissed at this point because I order a veggie bowl for the guacamole. I'm contemplating about leaving my food, but my husband has already paid. The staff member all of a sudden states that the guacamole will be done in 10 minutes, oh wait it's actually 6 minutes, but 6 minutes go by with no guacamole. I know, I'm a little confused too. Is it 10 minutes or 6 minutes? 10 minutes go by with no guacamole. Another 5 minutes & no guacamole. I end up walking out.   This place is a joke. I honestly can't believe they are still in business. Worst customer service & worst experience I've ever had at a Chipotle. I know it's a chain, but c'mon. This is just embarrassing. I will NEVER be back to this location.",

They're trying really hard but it's not up to par.  Everything needs a lighter touch.  Chips are severely overcooked, rice has too much water, burritos are beat to death in the wrapping process, tortillas are pressed too hard and come out stiff. There's an over abundance of oil on everything.  I think they'll be fine but they need to hit every step in the process with a tuning fork to get in proper shape.",

It was more of a burrito bowl then a salad. Then my boyfriends burrito was so wet on the inside it was dripping out. Severely disappointing.   Our previous order my boyfriends burrito was half the size and my salad the lettuce was soggy.   Will never visit this chipotle again.",

The Sofritas bowl with brown rice, black beans, corn, mild salsa and lettuce! Winning all the way around and the chipotle on South Blvd gives great portions and they are very caring and generous to their customers.  While I was there tonight I noticed a gentleman had lost his money so he was unable to pay for his and his girlfriends dinner. So he purchased hers and gave his back, as I was going to pay for it to help him out the manager said to the gentleman this ones on us. Shortly after another guy forgot to purchase his drink with his meal and the manager told him it was on the house. Highly recommend chipotle south Blvd for your lunch, dinner and even family.",

This was incredibly disappointing and  the employees had no interest in remedying the situation or even attempting to refill any of the toppings.

I ordered two bowls and needed condiments for both and she had the audacity to look at me and roll her eyes. I will NEVER order, purchase, even recommend this location to anyone.

It's so bad, in fact, that is has pretty much turned me anti-Chipotle and I neverrrrrr want to go to (here, or any other location). I know, GASP, the horror. Seriously, it's that bad here.  e.v.e.r.y. time I say, F*** it, I'll give it another show, I'm quickly reminded why I need to listen to my gut. The other night was no different. I show up and halfheartedly wait in line. Tell the first nice line worker my order, and he starts to plate up. It seems like they give you less and less protein with each visit. Either that, or this guy just wasn't feeling it that day. Not even that, I got the skimpiest amount of fajita veggies imaginable. I digress ... and keep moving down the line. My wife and I try to finalize our bowl but topping it with lettuce, they guy tells us they're \"out of lettuce\". I had to have heard correctly and said, \"you're out of lettuce. Are you serious? Just go open another bag...\". He replied \"yes, out of lettuce, it'll be about 10 minutes on that\". ARE YOU *^$#*$^# KIDDING ME? 10 minutes on lettuce that is probably already pre-bagged and ready to go? Whatever, bro. Move on down to the cashier and go to pay and ask for our chips + queso. My already annoyed face was met with \"Oh, we're actually out of chips right now. It'll be at least 15 more minutes. And we're out of queso\". Once again, ARE YOU *^$#*$^# KIDDING ME?  Chipotle has probably the easiest menu of any 'fast food/casual' restaurant. They've got only but a few options, and most of which come ready to go for them. I literally watched one of the cooks pour the black beans from a giant plastic bag out of the refrigerator into a pan on the stove to heat up. My point with this ramble is that with so few items to cook/prepare, how do you run out of g*d damn chips. The ONE and ONLY side 'dish' on the menu. And should could have cared less for the 'inconvenience'. You have one job, Chipotle. And you fail at it e.v.e.r.y single time. They're always out of something. This location seriously needs new management who knows how to properly train it's staff into how to maintain the food prep line.  TL;DR. They're ALWAYS out of something. Call it the ice cream from McDonald's, because the Chipotle machine is always down for repair.",

By the way they were telling customers it seemed like they had been out for quite a while. Customers could only get a bowl or a taco but who knows how many taco sized tortillas they had. To make matters worse with the bowl, they were also out of forks and only had spoons. I've never seen spoons at a chipotle before but based on the workers' responses this seemed normal, even though the silverware containers were labeled as forks and not spoons. Lastly, our order of chips did not look, nor taste like chips from chipotle should. They were much smaller and extremely stale and I'm pretty sure they were actually from Taco Bell, in which case I could've walked down the road and gotten myself the same amount of chips for half the price. I can't believe management has allowed this quality of food and service to be served at this location.",

    "text": "Chipotle just opened several locations near where I live, so I decided to give them a try.  I'm glad I did because they are really good.  Very fresh ingredients, the tortillas were soft and chewy, the lettuce was crisp, the salsa was hot, but not too hot, and the meat was savory, tender, with a unique and pleasant texture.  I threw some guac on top to make my tacos complete, and I was a happy camper.  For about the same price as a Moe's or Qdoba, Chipotle offers a much higher quality meal.  I was very impressed and will definitely be going back.  I had the tacos with shredded beef, and also tried a couple of bites of my girlfriends chicken burrito...she got the hot salsa on hers, and baby ...it was hot!  But still good, fresh tortillas, great ingredients.  If you're in the mood for Mexican, give Chipotle a try.",

    "text": "I really like the burritos at Chipotle. The barbacoa is an excellent combination of both tender and spicy. I like that I can order online and pick up my food at the register. I hate standing in line, and the line at Chipotle can get really long at peak times. The guacamole is also excellent, unless it's browning (more on that below).   Lately, however, I've been annoyed with the service. I always order a burrito and chips with guacamole online, but when I pick it up at the register, they just hand me a burrito. I hate having to look through my bag and hand it back to them. Also, the guacamole I've been getting has turned brown! In my mind, that means it's not fresh. If I'm paying $3 for guacamole, I want to be able to eat it without scraping brown chunks out of it. For these two reasons, I'm giving Chipotle 3 stars.",

    "text": "Chipotle oh Chipotle. What can I say? I love, love, love LOVE Chipotle. No matter what state you're in, you can always rely on Chipotle. Many restaurants (many, not all) offer organic meats and veggies.   One downside that isn't really a downside: Picking up multiple orders is a chore, because it's cafeteria style ordering/burrito making. Best bet is to fax or complete your order online. Have I mentioned that I love Chipotle?  They have a signature cilantro lime rice that is quite tasty. All of the meats are fabulous. For meats: Carne (steak), barbacoa (shredded beef), Chicken (chicken) and Carnitas (roasted pork). Pinto (whole not refried) and Black Beans are also tasty.  Phat Burrito is pretty good too, but Chipotle takes the cake for me. I'll take Chipotle over Moes, Qdoba or Salsaritas ANY day. It always taste much fresher than any other burrito place. For those of you who are hesitant to try Chipotle, you won't be disappointed.   Suggestion: Chicken Burrito w/rice, Black beans, Corn salsa, pico de gallo and hot salsa. Bam! That's the winner right there.  BTW have I mentioned that I love Chipotle?",

    "text": "Wisconsin Ave in DC was the first place/ time I ate at a Chipotle.  Primarily because it was a perfect place for lunch, located near a project I was working on and served healthy food, if you order correctly.  I ate there 3 times a week, so I must like it.    Anyway, I am happy to see that Charlotte finally has one in the area.  The place is fast food, which I normally avoid.  McDonald's formerly owned Chipotle with a majority investment in the chain, but do not let that discourage you as based on the quality at every other fast food Mexican place (e.g. Taco-Hell, Salsa-really-not, and even Moe's--which is not that bad) -- Chipotle is the Champ (Flaming Amy's in Raleigh bests it as that place is just cool).  They grill everything fresh and have an option for you health nuts called the Burrito Bowl, basically burrito ingredients sans the flour tortilla.    The location on South Blvd fit what I excepted, as do most chains.  You order what you want on your burrito/ burrito bowl from beans, to meat (chicken, steak - lean steak, pork), to fresh vegetable toppings.  This is done ala Subway order line.  So, by the time you reach the end your food is ready to go.  I recommend getting a side of salsa and chips.  The chips can feed two and they are seasoned with Sea salt (I think) and Lime.  It is a great fast food place.  Likes - . Lean steak . Fresh ingredients . Salt & Lime Chips . Healthy eating . Burrito Bowl  Dislikes- . Chain  . None near Cornelius",

Without the accent mark, it's just Chi po tull...not Chi pote lay...if that at all makes any sense. So until they add the appropriate accent to their logo, I'll continue to say it how it should be said...not how the company inappropriately wants it to be called. Anyways, I'm not a huge fan of this quick tex mex burrito joint. To me, there are several other places in Charlotte that are much better for getting the same thing.  The taste of their burritos just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's in the onions or spice flavor of their chicken, but I just wasn't a huge fan of their burrito or their sauces. To me, it seemed like a lesser tasting burrito than many other places such as Qdoba, Moe's, or Phat Burrito.  Chipotle isn't one of my favorites & I'd rather go to several other places to get a tasty burrito.",

Many of my friends have started driving to the further locations just because the service is terrible. 75% of the time I go, the meat is not ready and they tell me it'll be a 10 minute wait most of the time. Today, I spent 30 minutes in the location - that is far from \"fast\" food. They never apologize like most companies do if there is a wait and they tend to get frustrated with the customer over the situation. The location near the Target shopping center is a much better location, but it's also further. I wish that this location had the management and customer service that most other Chipotles have in the area. A simple \"I apologize for the wait\" would do wonders. Other locations often offer a free drink to people that are waiting and while I don't even find that necessary, it is very nice and makes the wait less frustrating when they are friendly about it. People may suggest to order ahead to avoid the issue and I did that for a long time, but every single time I would arrive at pick up time and they would tell me it's going to be a minute, which actually turns into 10-20 minutes. Just a very frustrating location.",
