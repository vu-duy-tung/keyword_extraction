From the many times I have gone there, either with friends of family, the food has been great. However, the delivery service is mediocre. One night when working late we ordered food for eight people, and food for seven showed up with one being wrong and one left off the delivery but we were charged for all eight. When we complained, the problem was resolved BUT the final one of the sub's came on burnt bread. Was that retaliation? I recommend you Dine in!",

It came a little cold, but nothing that a blast in the toaster  oven couldn't fix, made the crust crispy too! The salad was big and full of tomatoes, green olives, shredded carrots, red onion. Could've used more dressing for such a big salad, so I had to make my own. Which, btw is better than any pre-made. Garlic knots were ok, could've been baked longer. Otherwise, I'm happy with everything and will definitely order again.",

    "text": "If you are what you eat......then I am a LARGE Pizza Pie!  I had to give these guys a try, so in order to do this right I stopped by, looked around and placed a take-out order,  A slice of cheese, and a slice of pepperoni.   Now, let's get this straight, Tony's is hands down (IMO) the best pizza in Ballantyne, and having read good reviews from fellow Yelper's Libretto's Pizzeria was bound to get my attention.    The building is unique in its present design layout, and why I mention this is that you cannot use the back door as an entrance.  I had to walk all the way around the building, to enter the establishment.  This has a nice outdoor patio, but very few seating arrangements in the bar / front dining area.  The back area, ie the main dining area is nice in that it is a little more formal, located behind the wine racks with white linens on the tables.  After getting home, I tried the pizza, it was good, the crust was edible and not dried out like stale bread, and this warrants the opportunity of ordering a fresh large pizza, so that I may share with others.  Based on the reviews of other Yelper's,  I may just stick with the pizza, but as I see it, I eat enough pizza to to keep Libretto's and Tony's Pizza in business.  NCFoodGuy",

I've ordered the calzones several times and on more than one occasion the dough wasn't cooked thoroughly, so I ended up eating the filling and throwing out the breading. Another time, I ordered a side of pasta and a side of broccoli and the portion was excellent and made a meal of it. A second time, I ordered the same 2 sides since I was so pleased the first time and received really small portions and not the greatest quality the 2nd time around. Whenever my co-workers order from here, i'm a little bit weary and usually pass on their offer. I refuse to pay good, hard earned money for something that may or may not satisfy my appetite.",

A quick call on the way home from work will ensure it is ready for you when you arrive to take home. The staff is very friendly and quick to respond to any need you may have.   Try the penne palermo.

    "text": "Extra napkins?!? Libretto's has been on our regular restaurant rotation for 3 years, but after last night we're taking them off our line up. The only reason I gave 2 stars was the food was OK. My husband and I went to the Libretto's after the movies last at night. We arrived before 8:00 which I think is still relatively early for a Saturday night and noticed the parking lot was almost empty and wondered if they were opened. They were not busy; only 4 tables of people, but we had to wait before anyone acknowledged our presence to seat us. The place looked dirty--table tops that hadn't been cleared, trash on the floor and servers that looked like when they weren't taking an order they were standing over the dishwasher.  Not too long ago, I remember that Libretto's had tablecloths and butcher paper on the tables and a staff of professional servers. What happened? Are they going out of business? Once we were seated, we waited so long for anyone to take our drink order we were literally getting up from the table to leave...but then the server approached and we stayed. The screw ups continued. We ordered a house salad, garden salad and split an order of raviolis. The raviolis came out first, we had to ask about our salads, when those came out he brought two of the same salad. It was a joke. The manager came over, apologized and offered us extra napkins. What?!? Who in the restaurant business thinks that extra napkins makes up for completely missing the service mark? He went on to say that 4 people called in sick, he was firing someone else, something about a food truck and they were busy. Hello, it's restaurant week. Get it together, man! The food was good, but with the lousy service and lack ambiance we've experienced the past few visits we won't be back. Our server ended up crediting $10 off our bill, but they screwed that up, too. He brought two bills--one for the full price and one less the $10--and ran the full price bill through the credit card machine. My husband noticed it and the manager fixed it. Good luck, Libretto's.",

The hostess seemed new, in that she looked a little lost and kept assuring us that a table was getting ready for us.  There were at least 3 times where she came up to us and we thought the table was ready so we had a stand-up/sit down session going on.  At least we burned some extra calories before the meal doing that.  Once we got seated, our server greeted us warmly and we ordered drinks.  I split a roasted red beet salad with my mom and we all shared a 18\" Large New Yorker - mostly meats and cheeses with onions and colored peppers.  Everything was delicious.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their pasta.",

Next time, I will go with a slice and a salad.  I also stopped in last night around 9 or 9:30  to have a few beverages with friends on the patio.  The live music, laid-back atmosphere and friendly folks make it a great place to socialize.  I went inside once or twice, and the pizza smelled amazing.  I'll be back soon to have some!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that my co-worker and I went in last week and had a different server.   Young kid, probably out of college and although he was a little slow getting started, he made up for it and provided good service.   With a little more time and training, he could be excellent.  We did notice that the dining area consisted of me, my co-worker and another patron sitting at another table yet we sat next to a dirty table for over half our meal.  It took four people and numerous trips to clear a four person table.  Not the most horrible thing in the world but still, not very professional.   Then there was today.   Fail.  Royally.   We went back today.  How was our meal?   I wouldn't know since it was over before it began.  Last week and again this week, no hostess to greet you at the door so you're standing around looking like you're waiting for the 3:45pm bus to Nowheresville.  She finally shows up like she just came back from cheerleading practice   and seats us in the dining room.  There is no one else in there and there are two tables outside being served (total of 4 people outside).  A gentleman joins the dining area about 5-7 minutes after we arrive and he tells the hostess that he would like some ice water and she runs and fetches it for him.  Ummmm, it's hot outside. ....I sure would like a drink of something....Where's our waiter?  Then she winds up taking his order.  Hello?  Ma'am?  Bueller?  Bueller?  Anyone?!?!?!?  So he's got a beverage and his order placed and we don't have anything??!?  Two more minutes of waiting and it was over.  We left and I looked right in the face of the guy at the register who said absolutely nothing as we passed.  I wonder how long it took for anyone to even realize that we were gone.  My friend and I walked right over to Dickey's next door who must have overheard our conversation about your place because guess she gave us our beverages on the house.  Dickey's = 1 Libretto's = 0 Fail. #slackers",

    "text": "Soon after arriving in Charlotte I dined at Libretto's Pizzeria & Italian Kitchen for lunch with a family friend who works in a similar field. There are two area Libretto's: this one is in Ballantyne and the second one is uptown at the EpiCentre. Additionally, there is a NYC location and a fourth location in Jacksonville, Florida.  Libretto's serves a full Italian menu with specialty pizzas, salads, soups, traditional entrees and pastas as well as heros, wings, calzones and desserts. For lunch there are some great specials including the eggplant parm special that I tried. To start, we shared some of the delicious, buttery, garlic knots served with tomato sauce for dipping. These are truly worth the carbs and were great with the salad that comes with the lunch special (salad not pictured). The eggplant parmesan includes choice of pasta with sauce and it's a huge portion! I took half home for later. The dish itself was quite pleasing, with a well-balanced tomato sauce, lots of cheese and plenty of eggplant goodness. The pasta was also tasty with that same great tomato sauce.  I had one odd thing happen when I went to the restroom - I won't go into great detail but let's just say that the restroom needed some real attention! I mention this mainly because as soon as I told our waiter about the problem we noticed that the staff shut down the restroom for cleaning - a good sign that they actually checked out the issue when I brought it to their attention. Service was actually quite good overall, which is always welcome.  I really enjoyed my visit to Libretto's and I look forward to trying them out again soon for another lunch or for dinner. They are also prepared for folks who want takeout also as you can order pizza near the door and take it to-go. I will be back!",

I am frequent customer at their Park Road location and although the servers may be on the slow side they are above and beyond the Ballantyne staff, including the Manager. I arrived shortly after 12:00 and looking forward to the house salad, something I crave on a weekly basis and a good slice of pepperoni & mushroom pizza. Unlike the Park Road location you order at the counter here and they deliver your food to you. Upon placing my order I said I would be sitting outside. I waited over 20 minutes and walked inside and my slide was sitting there. Needless to say it was cold once delivered. I had a drink that sat empty for over 10 minutes so I, needless to say, walked inside to ask for a refill and was ignored by the server and the manager for over 10 minutes. By the time I got back outside the pizza was cold and I was very disappointed with the entire visit. I walked inside asked for a to go cup, which the Manager wasn't very thrilled about doing, and left. Needless to say, Libretto's does not have the greatest pizza, but I do enjoy the salads, but I will NOT be back to this location. So disappointing.",

My husband is a NYC native and while in the EpicCenter we were so hungry we went into the Liberto's there and grabbed a slice. I wasn't impressed, my daughter wasn't either (we are both Chicago Natives). My husband insisted that it was because the pizza had to be heated and if we sat down in the restaurant and ordered pizza that it probably would taste better.  We were staying in Camden Ballantyne in corporate housing while our home was being built and once evening when I refused to cook my husband said let's walk over to Libretto's as he was adamant on making sure we TRULY taste the pizza there because it's made NY style and he wanted to feel like he was back home in NY.. I must admit the pizza was tasty to be so THIN, being from Chicago I need some type of thickness to my pizza however the flavors were all there so I won't deny this place that fact. I say it's OK because I can eat it without complaining to much because of the flavor. I would recommend people to definitely give them a try. If you like thin crust, NY style pizza you are in for a treat. However if you like Chicago style pizza you will be disappointed however if you just like FLAVORFUL pizza then you are going to the right place.  I say this according to our ingredients we get on our pizza: Spinach, Garlic, Onion, Mushrooms  Other Tasty items we tried using our coupon book: Garlic knots, Shrimp Scampi (a tad bit bland but it will do with a coupon ;-)  Where they lack: SERVICE, they have some very unattentative staff and rude staff as well. I don't LOVE this place so I don't give them business often however the couple times I have I didn't have a great service related experience.",

Delivery is incredibly slow and will come warm if you're lucky with evidence of being thrown in the car. Anything fried is WAY too greasy. Meatballs and sausage are tasty but overall Librettos is inconsistent. It's sad, The two real non chain options in Ballantyne are mediocre at best. Seems this small business is struggling and the minimal portion control overpricing tactics are in full swing.",

Too often the crust is burnt so we started ordering our pizza \"undercooked\" which is still hit or miss on what you receive. The pizza always seems to look like it has a rough ride to our house. Tonight we ordered 1/2 sausage and received a full sausage pie after about a 75 minute wait (added photo of pie and order in the photos). My husband hates sausage. Disappointed.... Again.",

    "text": "This would be a 3 or maybe 4 star review but we continue to have issues with Librettos take out.  It seems everytime we take out an order, something goes wrong.  Either it takes an hour (this has happened) or they give us someone else's order (this has happened), everytime we take out, we are disappointed.  I really wish this place would get their act together when it comes to taking out food,  as we would be much more inclined to go and recommend.  When they got our order wrong, I should mention they did credit a little money back to us, but we still had to drive all the way back to the restaurant to get the correct order.     The food itself is solid.  Basic NYC pizza that you will find at numerous places in the south Charlotte area.  Nothing special about it, its solid.  The rest of the menu is just ok. Good beer options, the atmosphere is just ok, service is good (when dining in).  There are many options of NYC pizza in Ballantyne (thanks to the thousands and thousands of New Yorkers who have migrated here), and at this point I would probably go to any of them, sans Librettos.  I just can't promote or give business to an establishment that is constantly screwing up our orders.",

I will say that while we were sitting close to the bar, and ordered a \"specials\" drink from the sign behind it.  Midway through our dining experience, the bartender took down the \"specials\" and wiped it clean.  When the check came, she said that \"the sign was from yesterday\", and didn't bother to grant HER mistake since it was hours past opening, although she was probably too busy chatting it up with her friends that were seated at the bar to care.  Spoke to the manager after we left and he granted us a discount on our next visit.  So I would agree with everyone here, service is really bad.  That bartender should not work there - her handbag is up behind the bar, and she was putting on makeup during shift... isn't that unsanitary?  So besides her, everything else is great here.",

The food was good. I would like shine kind of sauce on the pasta. We ordered Chicken Marsala. And the sauce of the marsala. was good but the pasta could use a dressing. I would definitely go back and try the other items on the menu. The garlic knots write absolutely delicious. What a difference from having fresh garlic used to powder or seasoning as some other restaurants do.   I walked I to pick up our order and the place was smaller and not what I expected. Its relaxed and there's a bar that's nice for drink with friends or a date. I didn't find the bar area to be too loud as mentioned in another review. I would return.

    "text": "My husband and I went to Libretto's for a Yelp event last summer.  It was pretty good, so we wanted to go back for a full meal.  I kept this on my list for some time, but we rarely venture out that way.  When a Deal Saver coupon popped up ($20 for a $40 value), we decided it was time to go.  We went at 6:30 on a Sunday night.  There were a few people sitting in the bar area (including staff) and only one table of diners in the front dining room.  They brought us to the back dining room where there wasn't another person in there.  Then...we waiting 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  I finally caught the eye of a waitress...she rolled her eyes and came over.  She took our drinks orders with a scowl on her face.  Lovely.  I ordered water 'without' lemon and my husband ordered a beer.  Another 10 minutes later our drinks arrived....mine was a water WITH lemon...and not just any lemon....a brown, nasty lemon!!  We should have ran for the hills right then and there, but we decided to ride it out.   30 minutes into our experience, we were finally placing our food order.  We asked the waitress for recommendations and instead of telling us what was good, we got a rundown of what NOT to order.  (Say what?!?)  Again...we should have ran, but we didn't.   So...Chicken Parm with pasta and meatballs for my husband and Chicken Parm with fettuccini alfredo for me.  We also ordered a side of garlic bread.    Our food arrived 20 minutes later...minus the garlic bread.   At this point, we thought we were being \"Punk'd\"...we were waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out at any minute!   Alas...no such luck.     My husband's chicken parm was scorching hot on top, but the chicken was barely warm and the sauce on the side of pasta was a runny mess.  The meatball was HUGE...and so was the piece of cartilage/bone that my husband bit into.  GROSS!!!   He was done at that point.    The chicken parm on my plate was much like my husbands, except my piece was paper thin and the illusion of \"thickness\" was made up by a mound of luke warm sauce and a thick pile of cheese.  Nice try, folks!   The Fettuccine alfredo was the grossest thing that I have ever seen on a plate.  The alfredo sauce was breaking down so it was a gelatinous mess in some spots and watery in others. We both send our meals back, but we didn't want anything else....except the garlic bread!  (My husband was an angry bear at this point and needed to choke something down to stave off the anger...I mean hunger).    By this time, another waitress (one that actually smiled) delivered the garlic bread. We each had one piece...placed our certificate on the table...and got the heck out of there.  On our way out, the waitress asked if we wanted to take the certificate since the meal was being comp'd, but we told her that wasn't necessary since we wouldn't be back.    I don't know what happened between the summer and now, but it was like we stepped into the Twilight Zone!  We left disgusted, disappointed, and STARVING!   Maybe it was just a bad night??  Who knows.  Doesn't really matter because we will never step foot in there again!",

I love pizza. Dang, I've even dreamed of pizza. Granted, that was while I was pregnant but still. Pizza!!!!   Librettos has good pizza. They know what's up and have perfected their pie making skills. Their pies are a perfect marriage of crispness, cheesiness, chewiness, sweetness and tanginess all rolled into one.   It's one of the most perfect foods ever made! There. I said it.  Pizza is awesome.   There are a lot of places in NC that claim to have NY style pizza, but most of these places are houses of lies and are not even close. We order takeout at least once a week and I've had lunch a couple times in their restaurant.   Their lunch specials are great! What other place in Ballantyne can you get great service, a slice, salad and a drink for $5.95?   My favorite is the Monday special - cheese pie and garlic knots for $10.95. Good deal for a quick dinner when you don't feel like cooking for your family...mostly because you don't want to wash dishes or unload the dishwasher.   So, go here. Order pizza. Experience deliciousness. Repeat.   You're welcome.",

One evening the Chicken Francese is gourmet delicious and a couple weeks later it's barely edible. They do a very nice sauteed spinach as well. Best of all, they DELIVER! Very friendly delivery people, many from up north like we are. If we had any complaint it would be that we ALWAYS STRESS al dente pasta, and like the Chicken Francese (which comes with pasta - we ask for the penne, I think they they replaced that with Rigatoni) is sometimes overcooked. All in all our experiences with Libretto's food and staff on the phone and delivery people have always been good!",

I incorrectly assumed it would be a thin foldable crust.  If it was good pizza, I wouldn't care if it was NY style.  I was open and hungry.

When I asked him to show us he pointed to some small crumbs that I mistook for bread crumbs, and walked away.  We laughed - ate a \"floppy\" slice - and left with the rest in a box.  We stopped at Harris Teeter, bought some precooked sausage, took it home, and tried to revive it.  Not worth the effort...we should have just gotten Harris Teeter's instead.

The people are nice, the pizzas are fast, and the pies are tasty and generously sized. I'm a fan and I'm hoping to soon be unshackled from my desk and actually sit down in the restaurant and try some beers! Until then, the to-go service continures to rock Pizza Friday.",

There have been multiple times I've been there and there are plenty of other places to choose for pizza or Italian specialties.  My advice people go elsewhere!",

I def reccommend just ordering slices and having them heat them up there to eat because it ends up tasting better than when you do it yourself at home.   They also have some really great salads that are perfect for sharing, and even better they split them up for you and the portion sizes are big.  The service can be hit or miss depending on when you come in, but for really great NY style pizza I will overlook that in order to indulge myself!",

Upon paying he walked off without giving us a receipt, in which we had to signal to the pizza makers for help. They called the guy back, who then printed out the receipt, placed it on the box and walked off.  C'mon, even Pizza Hut knows better than this.

That being said, I have always gotten exceptional service at Libretto's.  My delivery driver (Mark) was super polite, and was even earlier than anticipated. The food is ALWAYS fresh and at the proper temperature, and they have NEVER botched my order.  I called and spoke with Jessica to update some of my account information, and she was so kind and accommodating! My expectations are always exceeded. My personal favorites are the lasagna, any of their pizzas, and of course, the cannoli. When I meet someone who has just moved to the area? I always recommend Libretto's- everyone needs their go-to neighborhood pizzeria! Keep up the great work everyone-  you've got a good thing going!",

When I walked in I did like the huge variety of available slices...they had cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and Chicken Parmesan just to name a few...   I opted for a slice of the Margherita and it was topped with fresh basil...which was super yummy...Now I was not disappointed with the toppings the fresh mozzarella and crushed tomatoes were delicious...However, in my opinion, the crust is the best part of NY style pizza...and to me this crust just turned out ok...it was not as thin and crispy as I usually like...or maybe I just had a bad batch...who knows!   But since they do have daily specials and lunch specials which seemed very reasonable, a good variety on the menu and a nice atmosphere with some tvs, bar stools ... I am sure I will be back...I have to give it one more try!",

Pizza, pastas, salads, calzones, etc.  And the portions are huge.  Wife had pizza there with a friend so we decided to do a lunch experiment.  Lots of take-out and not just pizza, plus on a Sunday, there were a number of people eating in and at the bar.  Went for somewhat of a sampler so split a salad, and glad we did because the portion was more than enough for two people.  Was good.  Calzone had the best dough or as my wife says, crust, ever.  And cooked perfectly.  Just ask to go light on the ricotta cheese as it is pretty dominant.  Ours was really cheezy and could have use more spinach.  Pizza slice was very good.  They can do thin crust and even have three thick varieties.  And they have prepared about a dozen pies that you can buy by the slice.  Very convenient for the business lunch crowd.  Service excellent.  And everything is made to order, so be prepared to wait, but the wait will be worth it.",

The food is good, well made, fresh, filling, and yummy.  My husband and I generally get take out on Friday nights, but last Friday (10/3/2014) I decided to tidy up well enough after my evening workout for him to actually take me out... (I know, sometimes it's more of a stretch that you'd guess after a long week)... the point is... we wanted to go somewhere tasty, and close to home... So we chose Libretto's (as we have done MANY times before)...  This time, we ordered the El Diablo pizza, and I had a spinach salad with salmon... The salmon was a TAD overcooked, but no matter... no one actually asked me HOW I wanted it cooked... The salad was crisp and fresh, and the pizza was delicious... I decided to really splurge and order a glass of the house white... it was a Pinot Grigio... cool, crisp, refreshing, and really took the bite out of the super spicy El Diablo.  Our waitress was prompt, courteous, very kind... the hostess who seated us was happy and chipper... the food was yummy, as always.  I have also had the meatballs, the lasagna, the antipasto, and many other dishes here... if you like garden-variety home-made Italian food, this is the place to go.  If you're looking for wait-staff in tuxedos and uber-fancy service... go elsewhere... people bring their families here... there's always some loud dudes at the bar, someone's always laughing too loudly... it's great!

The calamari was very soggy and the breading was seriously falling off of the calamari. It was not good. When we told the server, he must of told the manager and the manager came up to us and made a comment about how calamari isn't for everyone because they don't know it's squid. I had to let him know that I've tried calamari plenty of times and that I know it's squid and it wasn't the reason why we returned it, it was because it was soggy and the breading was wet. I've been back before ordering their pizzas to go and they are really good. Pizza sauce is so good. I highly recommend their pizzas!",

In one two week period I ordered delivery from them at least 3 times. My normal order is a medium pizza that's half cheese/half pepperoni. I also get a side order of fries. I've checked every pizza place in Ballantyne, and Libretto's is the only one with fries on the menu. (That delivers)   I've been to Italy, and my good friends are Italian and own a pizza shop, so I think I'm a decent judge of good pizza. This pizza is delicious! I'm really shocked at the reviews on here. I have lived in Ballantyne over 5 years, and I've eaten Libretto's many, MANY times and I've never been disappointed. We've only dined in there once, but I believe we got pasta. The cannoli is also fabulous, and even when getting them through delivery they arrive displayed so nicely!    Great menu! Great food! I'll definitely continue to eat my body weight's worth of their pizza!",

Then other times the pizza is cold or isn't cooked enough or just meh. It's really expensive pizza ($2.50 per topping with bacon costing the same as tomato?) so it's hard to justify the gamble. The pasta dishes are on par with Olive Garden. Ravioli tastes like froZen kind from grocery. Don't get to go slices- always cold and dried out toppings",

    "text": "On the coldest night of the year in Charlotte, Librettos didn't have the heat on. The dining area, for families and couples, has always been noisy beyond belief because there's no way to keep the noise from the bar out. The waitress told us that the entire restaurant at this location will be turned into a sports bar so the whole place will be noisy. Tonight's meal was our last at Librettos. I've lived in Charlotte over 27 years and seen some great restaurants fold up their tents and leave town. How you treat regular customers says a lot about the management. Food's still great, but it's a shame that the bar and sports crowd wins at this location. Thank you.",

    "text": "This was our 4th visit, all within the last 2 months.  The first 3 were good, but not this visit.  Overall, this is a good choice for good food at an affordable price.  The staff is good and hard working.  Our opinion changed during our last visit Friday night.  My wife and I arrived Friday around 6:30 and were told there was a wait, which was to be expected.  The hostess informed us that there was a table being held for a reservation and if they did not show-up we could have their table in 15 mins., if they did show-up it would then be about 40 mins.  We decided to wait.  Within 10 minutes the reservation party arrived, the hostess informed us and then said we were next.  Over the next 25 minutes we saw 3 different parties seated, finally when the 4th party was being shown their table we asked about us.  The hostess told me that we were a party of 2 and that the other parties were larger and were being seated at tables of 4.    To make matters worse, there was a group in the bar area celebrating a birthday, difficult to estimate but we thought there was 12 or so.  They were given 3 tables that seated 4 each as well as the 2 larger tables ( seating for 8 or 10 each ? ).  As you could imagine, most of the time these people were up and mingling.  In fact the 2 larger tables were being used for the food, with no one even sitting at them.  Considering all the other options available, I cannot imagine ever going back.  Mike, thank you for your quick reply.  Yes, perhaps I should have made an earlier review regarding our past visits, as I mentioned in this post they were all good experiences.  However, we were told by your hostess that after the party with the reservation came in, we would be next.  It was she who set the expectation, not us.  This party that came in was for 2, yet they were seated at a table for 4.  The other parties that were seated ahead of us did NOT have reservations, again, as per your hostess.  And finally, when my wife inquired as to why, your staff was rude, and one turned her back to my wife.",

    "text": "Another pizza joint that I wanted to love and another meh.  I have upgraded from a Meh to an A-OK out of charity.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was WOW either.  On my continued quest to find a white pizza that I love, I decided to try Libretto's after attending a Yelp Elite event that I didn't eat at because I arrived late, after already eating.  Everyone there had nothing but good things to say about the food, so I put Libretto's on my list.    While running errands today, I ended up on this side of town.  In Ballantyne shopping center, at the corner of Johnston/521 and Ballantyne Commons Pkwy, there is plenty of parking at the end that Libretto's is located at.  Arriving around 4:00 pm, there were a couple of people at the bar, but other than that, the place was empty.  A few folks came in and out retrieving takeout orders.  There is outdoor seating, indoor seating at bar-looking wooden tables and chairs and then a back area with tables cloths and a more formal setting.  There are 4 TV's in the bar area and they were tuned to golf on my visit.  The hostess, who was also my waitress, was pleasant.  I could have done without the singing/yelling from the kitchen area.  It's a mostly open floor plan so noise carries.  Even with practically no one in the restaurant (off hours on Father's Day), there was a hum to the place that made it rather loud.  I ordered a Diet Coke and a 10\" Pizza Bianca (white pizza) which totaled just under $13.  The crust was thin and crisp (too hard for my liking, but that is a personal preference) but didn't have much flavor, it also had a burned taste to me, though it was only black in a couple of places.  This may be exactly how it is meant to be, as some folks may like it, but I didn't care for it.  The ricotta for the white pizza was in blobs on the pizza.  While the ricotta was smooth instead of curds, the pizza was zzzzzzzzzz.  White pizza has to have an extra effort put into it since there is no sauce and I didn't care for this.  I shall continue my hunt for a delicious white pizza in Charlotte - so far, Hawthorne's holds the crown for the best to me.",

I've always though their food was good.  It's the service that usually lacks as was the case today.    I was craving pizza for lunch and Italian pie was my goal.  This was actually the 2nd place I went to.  The first place which was nearby was just a circus and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space.  So it was op to Plan B, Librettos.    Judging by Brian's review, I expected the place to be closed but it was open and the front was quite busy.  The back had a large group and 2 other tables occupied.  I was seated back there.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and a slice of sausage pizza and an order of garlic knots.  The knots came out right away and they were chewy with a great marinara sauce.   The slices took a while to come out.  How hard is it to heat up 2 slices?  Anyway, finally they arrived.  Both were large slices, not as large as other places but still respectable.  The pepperoni was crisp but all the slice was quite greasy.  And it lacked sauce.   The dough was quite good but I was left to dip it in the leftover sauce from the knots.  The sausage slice was less greasy and the sausage was thick and tasty but this slice also lacked sauce.   Is there a shortage on pizza sauce these days?  Anyway, it still satisfied my craving but I'd love to find a locally owned place that is generous on sauce on their pies.  Man cannot live on dough alone!",

    "text": "DO NOT EAT HERE!! THEY SERVED RAW CHICKEN THEN DENIED IT ONCE THEY TOOK IT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!   Nothing like sitting down for a nice lunch on my day off and getting 1/3 way into my chicken dish only to notice that the meat is raw!!! NOT WHITE. Pink to dark pink in color. So just had to run to the restroom as the thought of just eating raw chicken made me lose what I already ate of the lunch. I thought it was overcooked when I first bit into it cause of the consistency. Boy was I on the wrong end of the spectrum. SO disgusted right now. Stomach is flipping around.   It's a medium sized pan grilled chicken fish. How the heck do u serve that raw?!?!?!  It's been 15 mins now since I notified my server. He's been very apologetic. Said the manager would be right out and he's still not here. I'm sitting here nauseated, unhappy and they're making wait now?!?!?!   Waiter just told me he's testing the chicken before coming to see me?!?! Seriously?!?!?!  I cannot be more upset right now. The manager, Aaron, came out, immediately had an attitude asking me \"So what's you're problem with the food?\" He's now denying that the chicken was raw. He's saying it was completely white, lying to my face!! Even the server verified it was raw when he took it!!!!!! If it was clearly white like he claims, why the 20 min wait so they could test their cooking times and the chicken?????  This is how you run a business?!?! This is how you deal with making a mistake?!?! Tell me I'm lying so you can cover yourselves?!?! Cause I have so much to gain by a partially eaten meal and vomiting in the bathroom?!?!   Do yourselves a favor and do not eat here!!  Update: The icing on the cake. Apparently when u post a bad review on yelp the employees or friends of the employees for this establishment take it upon themselves to send you nasty private messages via yelp using newly created fake accounts.   While I appreciate the owner Mike returning my phone call and offering us a free dinner, until they get new in-store management we won't ever be back.",

Hadn't been a big fan of the pizza \"restaurants\" because typically they are really only good at pizza and not the other dishes.  I was in for a pleasant surprise at Libretto's Pizzeria.   Decor/Atmosphere: It reminds me of a pseudo bar in a pizzeria.  Traditional dining area is in a side room so I didn't have to have my kids around alot of people at the bar.  It was nice enough for the four of us to sit and have a meal and talk. Food:  There is where the surprise comes in.  I been to other types of restaurants like this and usually the dishes are overlooked because the place concentrates more on the pizza.  The family and I started off with simple mozz sticks.  The marinara sauce is outstanding.  For dinner I had the chicken marsala.  Typically not my dish, but it WAS GREAT!  Chicken was tender, marsala sauce was really good.  Even the presentation of a simple side salad was better than I usually get at other restaurants. Cost:  VERY good price for the portion sizes.Fed family of 4 under $40, even with appetizer.  If you want or need somewhere to be with your family or even for a simple date night with the Mrs or Mr., go to Libretto's for really good time and good food.",

The pepperoni wasn't that good and reminded me of kid's pepperoni- small, thick and curled up edges. The sausage side was much better. The crust was good, enough cheese but not enough sauce (for my husband).

The only flat wing was tiny, soggy, and had broken bones inside. My first bite of it consisted of a little bit of meat, soggy skin, and bone fragments. While the drums were sturdier (no broken bones), they were still soggy and not very good.   My ranch that came with the wings was only filled halfway.

    "text": "I've been in NC for 15 years and this was some of the worst pizza I have ever had. Everything from the crust to the sauce was not what you'd expect for a pizza. Huge disappointment. Spend the extra money to have quality italian food not overpriced ketchup on bread.  As a follow up and only because someone can't take constructive criticism....I am not affiliated with any of the places I rated. I work for a fortune 500 company in CLT and am a foodie plain & simple. I had a free evening and just decided to rate all the places I've eaten in the last few months including yours. I believe in rating the places I dine at no matter how good or bad. If you've done your research on my profile as you've indicated then you'll notice I gave more than one negative review and more than one review in the same day. I can't help it if the 5 star pizza place is the best in Charlotte.  You should try the pistachio pesto pizza. It'll make you want to close up shop, go to Italy and learn how real pizza is made. Boo-ya !!!",

I usually order delivery and On a few occasions, (not many) my order was incorrect (something not delivered or wrong). But what sets them apart from many other places is their management. They always make it right, he takes ownership and fix the issues. I am a consumer that can love something but if I am not treated right my business and money will go elsewhere. So with good food and service I will always be a customer. This is what you call getting right! If you are looking for good New York style pizza, this is definitely the spot.",

Unfortunately, neither of us cared for the mozzarella sticks. They were cooked to long so the cheese became hard and chewy. The salad tasted okay but it was the price that I can't agree with. It was $9 for the spinach salad and the entire entree barely filled up half of the container. The bacon pieces were all clumped to one side and seriously stuck together.  I think the concept is there: convenient locations, good menu, fresh food, but there needs to be better quality control.",

I ordered lunch from them for delivery on 2/4/19 and requested grilled shrimp be added for a surcharge which made the price nearly double the normal cost of the salad. The manager called to inform me that the additional menu item was not available and assured me I'd be refunded the surcharged amount. The next day I had to call off work for food poisoning (probably contaminated lettuce). I called the restaurant on 2/6/19 because no refund had been made to my account, and the manager said to allow 3-5 days for the credit. It is now 2/11/19, and I have not received anything from this restaurant except a $15 basic caesar salad (not even worth its regular price) with a side of food poisoning and horrible customer service.  UPDATE: @Mike, You blame the bank for your lack of responsibility and accuse your overcharged paying customers of lying. No apology or accountability for my inconvenience whatsoever....

Placed a takeout order on the way home as their location is about 15 minutes away with traffic.  Among other items ordered 2 orders of wings and asked for extra blue cheese.  Did not check the order before leaving, which I suppose is my mistake.    When I got home and unpackaged my order they did not include any blue cheese, which pretty much makes wings pointless.  I called the restaurant and advised them of their mistake.  They offered for me to drive back to get the blue cheese.  Since this would mean eating at least 45-minute old wings, I declined.  They seem to be confused as to why I was frustrated.  The manager then said they work refund 50% of the wings back to our card for the troubles.  I accepted and gave the manager my receipt number.    5 days later they still had yet to issue the refund so I called and asked to speak to a manager.  He advised that they would 1) go back and take care of the issue that day and 2) call me back to confirm.  No refund was issued and no call back happened.    I have worked in the in industry and mistakes do happen.  It's how you respond to those mistakes is what matters.  Libretto's was given 2 strikes to fix this simple issue and they didn't.  They have lost my business due to apathy.  All over some blue cheese.",

We ordered through Ubereats....Baked Rigatoni, Garlic Bread w/ Cheese and Pinwheels with pepperoni and extra cheese. What a waste of $35. I took before and after pics...first impression and after we actually dug in.   First of all, there was nothing baked about the rigatoni. The sauce was watery and the cheese was just melted on top. The \"garlic bread\" was basically a sub roll with cheese melted on top, and I'm pretty sure there was no garlic anywhere near it. The pinwheels would have been decent if the cheese used wasn't so salty and if the bread had been cooked through...literally raw dough inside. We ended up throwing eve. Please see the pics...you can't make this stuff up. Needless to say, I will never be ordering from here again.   **Response to Mike: Thanks for responding. The mere fact that you said \"you don't know what other baking could be done\" to the Rigatoni is odd to me. Maybe you're right about the missing ricotta b/c there definitely wasn't any in there, but even if it had been, the sauce was so loose and watery that I fear it would have produced the same or at least a similar result. The \"garlic sub roll\" could have at least had garlic on it! The Pinwheels literally had uncooked dough inside....forget a/b the fact that they were salty. I said in my review that the saltiness was from the type of cheese used. I still stand by everything said in my review, and I, too, wish I had a better experience with Libretto's. Unfortunately, I did not. Thanks again for responding though.",

I could not find them anywhere ...a couple of brown small pieces of what looked like fake meat but no grilled chicken. I also ordered a 18 inch  Il Diavolo , well I received a 10 inch with 5 pieces of Pepperoni and a couple small pieces of what I think was sausage. Once again, I liked the crust, but the pizza was so lacking in toppings it was ridiculous on top of being 8 inches too small!  They did refund me 10.00 but I dont know if I would ever chance ordering Pizza again from them.  Now for the positive. I also ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms which were probably the best I have ever had! The cream sauce over the top was so delicious I could have drank it as soup!! My thoughts are so confused on this place. Not sure what to do?",

I ordered the New Yorker pizza, and it was fine... Pretty basic yet scarce toppings. They go very light on the sauce which is fine... But the pizza was so bland and flavorless I couldn't tell if it had any seasonings or salt at all. Then I moved on to the Buffalo wings. I could tell by looking at them they could possibly be fried soft., and I was right. Sadly again, unimpressed with my selection. If I was in the kitchen I would have left the wings in longer... Who wants to chew squishy buffalo skin? Gross. Will be trying other pizza parlors around the city in search of something better, which shouldn't be too difficult.",

    "text": "I have spent a lot of money in the uptown location and the Ballantyne location.  We would often have several people go to the one uptown and get pizzas and beer before a game.  When they opened the Ballantyne location, I began patronizing that one as well.  They had a good deal on Mondays for a large cheese pizza and garlic knots that we often ordered.  I called to order it this week with toppings added as usual and they told me the special was just for cheese; if I wanted any additional toppings I would have to pay full price for the pizza.  I explained to them that we ordered this often, and they said the owner changed it to this.  Besides the fact that any other pizza place lets you add toppings to a special for the price of the toppings, I do not want to support a business that is that cheap.  It makes me wonder where else they may be trying to cut corners, and based on previous reviews of poor customer service, they may not be doing too well.  Sorry, Libretto's.  You lost a loyal customer who turned many others onto your pizza.  I'd rather support a franchise than this business now.  My pizza dollars will be spent elsewhere.",

I don't think I've ever had this happen. Someone reheated the white pizza from the case! It was stale, burnt, brown on top, quite disgusting. I informed our server who \"tasted it for himself\" to see if he agreed. We had to wait for another pie to be prepared fresh. No adjustment made in our bill. No apology from a manager. Too many other places to get pizza in Charlotte. Oh and how do we know the pizza came from the case? It was full when we came in; one pie was missing when we left.  Won't be back at Libretto's.",

NFL playoffs is the perfect excuse for pizza delivery, and whenever my husband and I give into our pizza craving it doesn't take long before we call Libretto's.  It is by far the best pizza in Charlotte and we were thrilled when we found their Ballantyne location.  We have eaten Libretto's pizza many times and we are never disappointed!  That being said,  I have to rate the restaurant itself a 4/5 is because while the pizza is unbeatable, the rest of the menu doesn't offer anything to write home about. My husband and I were both disappointed after testing out a few pasta dishes and salads. So make Libretto's your go-to pizza place, but don't assume it can meet all your Italian dish needs.",

    "text": "If I could split this review in two, I would give the food a 3 and the delivery a sub ZERO.    The food...we appreciate the fresh ingredients.  Delivery Order 1# The garlic knots are great...if you get them.  Ordered a Tuscan Salad with grilled chicken and garlic knots along with a pizza.  The Tuscan salad has bacon, ditalini pasta and blue cheese crumbles for $8.95.  Chicken is an additional charge.  For $8.95 it would have been nice to visually SEE the blue cheese instead of having to hunt if it's even there.  The salad was mostly lettuce.  Even the ditalini pasta?  Come on, it's pasta, it's cheap, it's an Italian restaurant!  I could probably count 10 little noodles in the salad.  This salad had the potential of being great but the chintzy portions of the featured ingredients makes it waay over priced.  People make meals of these salads, make it worth a meal!  The chicken was nicely packaged separately and tasted great, but again, we paid extra for that.  As for the garlic knots, they never came with the order.  I called the restaurant and they offered to send the delivery person back out, but seriously?  I was starving and didn't want to feel guilty not tipping someone a second time for $2 worth of garlic knots so I asked for refund (fyi, plz refund your customers the tax they paid with the order, not just the item).  Pizza for hubby was delish and waaay over priced.  Charging $2.50 per topping is excessive and not being able to make a minor swap on a specialty pizza is uncommon.  So when you start with a cheese pizza and add 5 toppings you end up with a $28 large pizza!  Unfortunately it arrived bone cold because it took an hour and half to get our order!  SO you're not only upset about waiting for so long, you still have to turn on your oven and wait to reheat a fresh pizza!  Delivery Order #2  This time, a pretty simple calzone, 6 wings and a large pizza (yes, the same ridiculously expensive pizza).  The calzone was disappointing in the portions of ingredients.  I had pepperoni in the calzone and couldn't even taste it.  In general it was \"meh\" and I was just hungry so I ate it.  Will I reorder it again?  No.  We tried the chicken wings and those were actually quite tasty...best part of the order.  Hubby's pizza had those fresh ingredients again, but guess what?  It took an hour and half to get the order again and it's not a busy night!  It's Monday!  Pizza was soggy even after reheating and the whole meal was a general disappointment.  Total price of the order with delivery?  $46.13  In both cases we had to call the restaurant and ask where our order was.  We kinda felt sorry for the delivery guy who had some story about a previous \"serious order issue\" that caused the delay.  He told us we could call the store and contact the manager.  Frankly, that's not our job.  Great customer service would have had that manager calling the people who have been waiting a ridiculous amount of time and personally apologizing.  It's not hard to look up a phone number on a take-out order.  All in all, there are too many other pizza places locally to deal with these issues.  It's just not worth the aggravation dealing with this place, especially after you've worked a long day and just want to have a nice meal before 9pm!",

The crust is thin and crispy (excluding their deep dish pizza which I have not tried yet.) and it does not get soggy.   There is a nice variety of different pizzas to choose from (my favorite is the BBQ Chicken) or you can create your own. Slices are offered during lunch and are priced very reasonably.   If you are looking for a slightly more upscale experience, Libretto's can help with a very nice dinning room that is separated from the more noisy bar area.   So why only three stars?   Well, service tends to be somewhat on the slow and spotty side (refills are key to keeping me happy).   And then there is the other half of the offerings at Libretto's - the pasta dishes.   The Chicken Marsala we ordered was a chicken breast with a couple of mushrooms and an extremely watery and runny sauce added to our choice of noodles.  The side salad was mainly lettuce with a small slice of tomato hiding at the bottom and dome flakes of cheese.   I expect more from a restaurant that advertises Italian \"cuisine\".   Stick to the pizza and you shouldn't be disappointed.",

Unfortunately, things have changed.   The past three deliveries have been pretty badly burned. Not just a little over cooked, but burned.   And to make it worse, for the last three deliveries (at least, we didn't check before), they have doubled charged the tip amount. I put $5 in the online order, and they've billed me $10 each time. It's a $15 pizza, a 66% tip is a bit ridiculous.   I have really liked Libretto's in the past, and for that reason I will give them at least one more try (they have an option to order your pizza slightly undercooked, maybe I need to do that from now on).

On our first trip 2 days ago I ordered a Brooklyn Pizza as an appetizer along with eggplant rollatini.  The pizza was very good, similar to pizza we have eaten in NY. I would have liked the crust a little crunchier but nothing that another couple of minutes in the oven couldn't fix. The eggplant rollatini appetizer was very tasty, i just didn't care for the skin on it.  For a main course I ordered fettucine alfredo with a side of meatballs and my wife ordered linguine in clam sauce. All I can say is both dishes were off the chart delicious. The fettucine cooked perfectly with the alfredo sauce had wonderful flavor and wasn't as heavy as some I've had before. The meatballs, big and tasty, were very close to the ones I make myself from my mothers recipe. As for my wifes meal she said the clams were fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  We will certainly be back to try more items on the menu.",

The music was a bit loud and too rocking for a lunch crowd. C'mon can't you play some Sinatra?   The staff here was quick, courteous and friendly. I made it before the lunch rush and was in a hurry to make it back to work for an afternoon conference call.   The food here is pretty standard: pizzas, pasta and salads. The lunch specials were reasonably priced and included a side salad and soft drink. I choose the lunch special of Penne Vodka, Garden Salad & Coke.  The salad was very basic consisting of baby field greens, tomato and light dressing. I was kinda puzzled that no bread was served before or during the meal.  Italians are known for their bread. I was a bit disappointed in this omission. Penne Vodka was great. The pasta was cooked al dente and the vodka sauce was savory.   If you are in the area let Libretto's bring NYC Italian to you.",

When I get in late from work I just call in an order for a Tuscan salad with grilled chicken...it's awesome.",

I live literally 1 minute from the pizza shop and it was delivered cold. Delivery person was nice and went back to get another pizza (this time made right) but not worth the hassle or money (was very expensive, over $30 for a large pizza and 2 drinks...and the pizza didn't even taste that great)  Defonitely will not be a return customer.",

    "text": "The good:  Location is very good for Ballantyne and the restaurant itself is clean and well decorated.  The staff was friendly and service was prompt.  I would give this part of the visit 4 stars, but I came for the pizza.  The bad:  I consider myself a pretty decent pizza connoisseur, but I'm not a pizza snob.  I'll eat what's available and won't generally complain.  While our meal may have been worth $25, it was not worth the $55 we spent on 2 sodas, a small salad and 2 pizzas.  Maybe their pasta dishes are really good, but the pizza just wasn't.  We ordered a plain cheese that was definitely plain; bland and without flavor, but it was also too doughy and way undercooked.   We also had their 'New Yorker' that really looked great to the eye.  They didn't skimp out on the toppings at all, but it was also without flavor despite the onions, roasted peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms.  While it was more cooked than the first pizza, the crust was nothing special.  Flags always get raised in my mind when the wait staff bring Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes all to the table when a pizza is ordered.  If customers ask for those regularly, it supports that the pizza has no flavor.  I give the pizza 2 stars and so a 3 star score overall.  Will you die if you eat this pizza?  Probably not, but for pizza there are other local places MUCH better. (See Zio or Riccio's for example)",

Yes, I know that there are Christmas Parties all over the place so when we wen to Libretto's we found that we had to sit in the bar (which is fine) because the dining area was being used for a party. But when you eat in the bar the food comes as if you were eating in the bar. No bread with dinner, appetizers coming out with the for (yes, these are not a big deal, but they are really nice for dinner.) It was just a very odd experience. The calamari wasn't done, the soup was wrong, the grilled shrimp added to the pasta was not added and then brought later at full price. I am so sorry but these simple things do add up.",

    "text": "We visited Libretto's Pizzeria in Ballantyne last night, after a torrential downpour. It was relatively empty even though it was a Saturday night, due to the weather.  The restaurant is smaller than it looked like it would be from the outside. It has faux brick walls and rustic wrought iron accents. There are at least 5 large televisions in the relatively small bar area. We opted to sit at the bar, as the hostess informed us the back dining room was a little loud.  Service was unimpressive. After 5-10 minutes of waiting, we caught a waiter's eye. He came over and asked us if we'd been helped. When we said no, he seemed taken aback, but decided to take our food and drink orders anyway, and he was our waiter for the night. When I ordered Miller Lite, assuming I'd get draft since it was clearly on the tap, I was surprised to receive it in a bottle. He explained that it was on special in the bottle, which was great. Just wish he'd mentioned that earlier.  When my husband needed a drink refill, our waiter was either nowhere to be found or actively ignoring us. (He had perfected the \"ignore everything but what's directly in my line of sight\" walk throughout the restaurant.) Someone who appeared to be a manager paced all around us, but his eyes were so glued to the Panther's game on the television that there was no way to get his attention without shouting at him or physically going up to him. After waiting so long for a refill that he had almost finished his meal, my husband finally decided to go directly to the bar for his refill. When the bartender informed our waiter, he didn't seem terribly pleased with us, but it was a relatively empty restaurant, and trying to flag down someone - anyone - for ten minutes for a refill was unacceptable.  The pizza (San Gennaro) was good, but didn't stand out. We ordered a Medium which was ample sized for 2. The Bruschetta \"3 ways\"? Not so good. The classic tomatoes/onions bruschetta topping had pale tomatoes. Not a sin in December, but it's August. The olive tapenade was good, but the bean puree was underseasoned and bland.   We had a nice evening out at Libretto's, but the food was pretty forgettable and the service was sub-par. I'm pretty sure we won't be back. There are too many other good pizza options in this area of Charlotte.",

This has NO tomatoes but it had about five places where tomato sauce has been poured in a puddle. Basil?  Approximately 1 tablespoon on the entire pizza. Price? $18.95. As far as I'm concerned it's the worst pizza I've had in 20 years including freezer pizza.  Be warned.",

I love the fact you can just get a slice anyway you want it. My personal favorite is the Chicken Parm pizza slice.  It's good thin crust.   The garlic bread is okay, needs more garlic.   Service is good, not great, but it's a pizza joint.  I know it's in the middle of Ballantyne and the residents near there are used to a more posh type experience, but hey like I said it's a pizza joint. If you want great service go to Ruth's Chris.   Great location, good selection of beers.   If going to have pizza, this place is on the short list.",
