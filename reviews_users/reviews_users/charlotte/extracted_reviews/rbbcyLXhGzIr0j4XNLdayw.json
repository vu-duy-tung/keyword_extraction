I was a little frustrated from my day when I came through the drive-through and when lady behind me honked her horn I definitely lost my temper. To say the least it's been a stressful day. The man who took my order outside was beyond nice, even when I didn't deserve it. When I got to the window Chick-fil-A through a \"random act of kindness\" (also known as you're clearly having a bad day let us do something nice for you)  gave me my meal for free. Even in a moment where I let my temper get the best of me these wonderful people managed to do something so extremely nice that it completely blew my mind. To the man who took my order, I am so sorry and I am embarrassed for my actions. You are a truly wonderful person! To the entire staff at this Chick-fil-A you guys deserve a medal for your kindness. I paid for the ladies meal behind me as a cheap \"I'm sorry\". I guess I'm saying all this the staff can know how far their kindness really went. I will definitely remember this. Thank you..",

The last time the woman at the register gave my son a stuffed cow and then later a balloon - that made his day!!!  They have great family-themed events (Pirate & Princess night, Mom's Morning Out, etc., Mommy & Son Date Night to name a few) and we really just love going there.   They bring your food to your table, which is great when you have your hands full with a little one!!  The bathrooms are always clean and the food is of course delicious!  The only complaint I would have is that a lot of older kids seem to end up in the play area.  We went a few weeks ago and there were kids in there (unsupervised) that were at least 9 or 10 that were climbing up the slide, on top of the slide, running around and just being really rambunctious.  Granted, kids are kids and they were just having fun, but a little girl was coming down the slide when one of the boys was climbing up and she ran right into him.  We ended up leaving because my son started trying to copy the little boys and it was just getting a little too rough.  Not sure what the solution could be. Perhaps they could be a bit better about patrolling who goes in to play? This has only been the case a few times and has not deterred us from returning.   Overall, the best Chick-Fil-A in our area!!",

You get a number, and they bring your food to you.  The first thing I noticed was the play area. It was really nice, but then we noticed a sign that only 3 and under could be in there, and we didn't get that. My kid is 5, and is still in that age to play, but whatever...  I like this Chick-Fil-A because it wasn't crowded. And this is the main reason for my review. It wasn't like the other Chick-Fil-A's that are the mecca for stay at home moms which they turn into stay at home mom HELL.  If you want to avoid that crowd (like the Mooresville location), and if it's possible, come to this one.",

Luckily for me, I had a craving this week and didn't ignore it.  This location is the closest to me and every time I have been the service is friendly and the food is always great. Although I have tried a variety of items I am an 8 piece chicken nugget meal gal!  This most recent visit the nuggets were fresh and warm, the fries cooked to perfection.  I always ask for a side of pickles, because that is something I miss from the chicken sandwich.  So, yes, this may sound strange, but I put a pickle on the nugget and dip in the barbeque sauce, heaven. Another treat, their Cole Slaw. Add a side of cole slaw to your next meal, you will not be disappointed. A side order is actually pretty large that I always have left-overs, which I love.  Overall, I know why the drive thru is always packed, and the lines at the Chick-fil-A food courts are always the busiest. Chick-fil-A doesn't disappoint and the food can meet the needs for all, offering grilled chicken, fried chicken, soups, salads, desserts and more.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE CFA, dislike this location A LOT!! I was so excited when they built this location, as it's close to where I live.  Excitement has been short-lived and although I've given them additional chances, issues continue.  Fast food experiences should not be this complicated.    Getting in and out of this parking lot is a nightmare.  There's one way in and one out.  Traffic backs up to South Blvd during most hours of the day, from the drive thru lane and customers. Having someone in the parking lot taking orders does not speed up this drive thru window.  The Drive-thru line is so SUPER slow!   If you think you're being smart by going inside, it too is a madhouse! This location just isn't prepared to handle the volume of customers that it attracts.    Parking lot is another roller coast that one should be prepared to deal with.  As my visit today will show you, multiple people have created their own parking spots since the parking lot was full.  Another KIND customer parked directly behind my car, keeping me from leaving because they had blocked me in!!   TIP!! Double check your order before you leave.  I've often gotten home and been missing portions of my order- only to have to drive back and deal with said obstacles above, again!   SECOND TIP!! Do yourself a favor, if you're really craving CFA, drive to the Woodlawn Location.  Your CFA experience will be much better there.   Three stars because their quality of food is ...well, CFA good but even their condiment station needed help today.  It was dirty with spilled creamer, sugar and empty napkins holders.  I can expect that at McD but not CFA!  Good luck getting attention from an employee, they're all busy trying to fill orders!",

I don't eat a ton of fast food, but Chick-Fil-A is in my rotation when I do. This location is kind of tricky. It's always busy. If you're trying to turn left onto South Blvd when leaving here, good luck. It probably will not happen. Traffic seems to always be non-stop crazy on South Blvd.   They have an actual person walk up to your window to take your order while you wait in the drive-thru line (allegedly speeds up the process). Personally, it makes me uncomfortable to look at the menu and debate just how many nuggets I need while a person hovers over me. Watching. Judging. Oh well.  Also, Chick Fil A sauce is superior to all other sauces here. Shout out to Sarah C for teaching me that very valuable piece of info. Can't believe I've been wasting all these years on Polynesian sauce.",

    "text": "Wow, I can see why this location ranks so much lower than the chain's average. The owner must be proud.  For 20 minutes I periodically kept trying to phone their office, getting a busy signal. They'd mistakenly put pepperjack cheese on a sandwich - that's all - and I simply wanted to call ahead in advance of my next visit, rather than handling it at the counter - to avoid holding up the line and having to explain it all twice. Once the phone line cleared though, it rang for 10 more minutes before being answered, suggesting the previous caller was also just someone trying to get through.  After clearly mentioning that I still had my receipt, I was greeted w/ this sole sentence from the disinterested manager who answered: \"Okay, just bring back your receipt and we'll replace that.\"  Oh thanks - you're actually gonna go and do the **absolute minimum** you can - which is provide me that which I've already paid for in full, after I journey all the way back over there **due entirely to your error**, but it doesn't dawn on you in that scenario to say something like \"sorry about that\"?  When I asked if she'd take down my name, she declined, and despite my having specified twice that I had my receipt, she again reinforced that no product would be replaced w/o it. It's always nice when a company you **oh so frequently patronize** screws up, has you waste more time and money to correct it, offers zero apology - only to then make the matter considerably worse by hinting that customer could be lying over a $3 food item. If that was a serious concern, why didn't she just ask for the transaction # off the receipt at the top the call? Or btw if she'd take a look at my phone and last month's debit action, she'd see I WAS probably one of their more regular customers - dropping in about every 3 days.   So thanks for wasting my good will, my $$ and a lot of my time - including time just trying to get someone on the phone - only to be rudely dismissed as practically a nuisance.  When I'm back on that side of town, I'll absolutely drop off that receipt to the GM and politely decline anything offered - explaining that this woman's performance has undone my appetite for the brand. Especially at any of this franchisee's locations.",

After ordering my milk shake I waited a longer amount of time than usual ~5-8 minutes, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Turns out that someone that works there was making themselves a milkshake before leaving their shift, which caused the hold up. The cashier brought my friend and I our milkshakes without whipped cream and a cherry even though that was what was ordered. We had several people behind the counter staring at us wondering what we were waiting on, who never approached us to ask until the last minute. They were somewhat rude when they asked what we were waiting for to which I answered two milkshakes that we had to send back to get additional toppings on. This took another 2-3 minutes. Overall professionalism of the workers was not up to par for Chick-fil-a. It felt like I was in a McDonalds or Burger King, customer service wise. Also once we got our milk shakes they were not thick at all, way too liquidity, and sloppily put together (whipped cream and cherry).",

Granted not every establishment offers a discount for military or veterans but to be told that you have to be in uniform to receive a privileged discount that they offer is unsettling. No matter the fact you have some portion of you life to serve your country and that you was one of the lucky ones to make it back only to be told no because you're not in uniform. Keep in mind that any service men or women have to have documentation showing they served to receive a veterans ID. I believe chick-fil-a needs to review their policies all together.

When we pulled up to the women the cashier gave us the sauces we requested but proceeded to talk to her co-workers that were all huddled around and attempting to clean the restaurant.

Before I could respond she handed us our food without a thank you or anything.  When we came home, our food was prepared sloppy. I did not have cheese like I asked and even the box had with cheese. My boyfriend's cheese on his sandwich was only on a 1/4 of the chicken and the rest was off the sandwich.  We were utterly disappointed. I see why this store has such a low rating.

The customer service was on point as usual. And there was no one online inside. But the drive-thru line was insane. Got our salads in 5 minutes or less brought over to our table.   This particular location has a children's play area outside,  but it was so cold inside that we sat out there.  Wish there were tables for non-children-having-people outside.  Got the Southwest salad with chicken. The salad came with seeds in a package on the side,  tortilla chips on the side and dressing on the side,  all in little packages. The container was good to save the salad in case you don't finish it.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, this Chick-fil-A has been hit or miss. Had a good experience the first few times and then it turned sour. I go to Chick-fil-A, always expecting the best customer service because they always provide the best customer service. This location has been a little different. You don't always get smiling faces. You may also not get your whole order, as I was missing my hash browns and wasn't pleased with the error. The associate didn't apologize when I went back either, which was even more surprising. I always order a hash brown scramble bowl with sausage and no cheese. They had to remake it one time and I'm assuming they took the sausage out of the cheese bowl and put it in the new bowl without cheese. Skimping me on my sausage which wasn't the greatest either. I'll still visit this location because it's right by my job so it's convenient. Hopefully they'll become a little more consistent. They're very deserving of these 3 stars and I hope I'm able to update my review with a higher rating soon.  Updated Reciew on 12/1: I came here for breakfast on 11/30. I ordered the same thing I always get. Hash brown scramble bowl with sausage and no cheese, hash browns as the side and a sprite with light ice. I HAD NO HASHBROWNS IN MY HASHBROWN SCRAMBLE BOWL! Nor did I have hashbrowns on the side. I can't win with this location :(. I called the same morning and no one answered. I had to work so I couldn't keep calling. Waste of $6!!!",

I called this morning at 10:30am when one of the powers that be in my office decided that we needed to feed 66 or so people lunch today in my office.  Too late for catering delivery orders, ezcater was NOT to the rescue, nor was DoorDash... so it was down to me.    I called Anya and asked if she could swing 2 large platters of nuggets, a large platter of strips, 40 classic CFA sandwiches, 2 platters each of fruit and cookies, tons of chips, etc... She said it would be ready at noon.  I got there supremely early at 11:30... they had us out the door with all of our food in easily carry-able bags by 11:45.  I was at my office and feeding hungry folks by noon.  Anya (and team) - I cannot thank you all enough!  Thanks further for helping us carry it out to my car.  You all are THE BEST!!!",

She somehow gives great service with a smile??? Kris is awesome. She takes orders with a line full of customers while a thousand employees are inside. I hope chick filet appreciates this young lady as much as i do",

Then we got to the window our bag was handed  to us  by a man (i assume he was a manager...dont have a name he was african american gentlemen...who was NOT a gentleman)and the window door slammed shut.  We had to drive around and my supervisor had to walk into the building in order to obtain a receipt for our car order.  Of course my chicken was luke warm and the biscuit was dry...even found bits of paper in my drink. I'm not sure what's going on at this location but this is the worst Chick-fil-A I have ever been to In My Life! If you want to get what you expect from Chik-fil-a do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY FROM THIS NEGATIVE HOLE. Seems like the employees just run their own agenda there",

Looking to turn left into the restaurant is a pain as is. Now imagine trying to turn left onto South Blvd. Well good luck on that. Hope you have patience that day..   Food: 5/5 they serve their food hot and freshly made. Which I appreciate!   Staffs: 4/5 most places I went too. They're customer service is top notch for a fast food joint. But yesterday they had their bad day apparently. Some staffs went beyond. I opted for a dine in so the food was brought to me.   Cleanliness: 4/5 they tried their best to keep the place clean. But during lunch hour. That's when it get chaotic so it's hard to keep up   Overall: I know there's a lot of locations I can pick from but when my craving kicks in and it's close to where I work. I would try to dodge peak times! And just starve til then",
