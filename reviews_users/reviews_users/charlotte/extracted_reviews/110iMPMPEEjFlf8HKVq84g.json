    "text": "On my last visit to Charlotte I was only there for 3 nights. Two of those three my husband and I had dinner at 131 Main...  My first visit early on a Wednesday evening. My husband prefers to eat at the bar because he likes to watch sports on the televisions and he has obviously been there often based on the fact that his name was called (much like Norm's on Cheers) when we entered the bar.  It is a very pretty, upscale restaurant with very friendly staff... Erin and Cindy were behind the bar when we arrived and Lauren took over for Cindy during our visit. These ladies are all friendly, funny and unflappable!  Even when we threatened to kidnap Erin and force her to live in our basement and make us her delicious margaritas, her only concern was if she would get to share them with us! LOL!  I had the filet with smashed red potatoes and the filet was awesome and cooked to the temperature that I ordered. I fell in love with the buttery, delectable potatoes! And although I hate to admit it, when I saw the generous serving of potatoes, I was sure that I would not be able eat them all, BUT I DID!!! (Needless to say, I was miserable after - but it was worth it).  My husband had soup (which I did not try, but he said it was delicious) and cornbread. Now I noticed that one Yelper mentioned that he could get cornbread free at a local diner and why would he order it here... It tells me that he obviously has not tried the cornbread here... It comes piping hot and delicious in it's own little skillet and I have NEVER had cornbread that is so delicious! If he knows of a local diner that is giving this stuff away for free, I would DEFINITELY be their best customer!  The friendly and attentive bar staff combined with great food and drinks won me over and we ended up spending the following evening back at 131 Main. There was a new lady behind the bar and it was almost 9:00pm on a Thursday, so there was no one else at the bar, which I would have credited for the excellent service if we had not had the exact same type of service the evening before when things were crowded.  This time we ordered the Danish ribs to share and I am pretty sure someone was playing a harp in the background every time I took a bite! They were tender and scrumptious! I ordered more of the smashed red potatoes, rather than the fries because I figured if I was going to have to wear pants with rubber in the waist for the rest of the week anyway, I might as well enjoy some more of their buttery goodness!  I have no doubt that this will be one of the places we visit when I make my final move to join my husband in Charlotte.",

He asked my fiance and I to come back in and give them another try after he addressed the issues. I was very impressed with the customer service. My review was handled quickly and we spoke immediately to try and get our concerns resolved. Last night, I made a reservation for my fiance and I to come in and have a dinner to celebrate his birthday. Upon arrival, there was a Happy Birthday balloon waiting for us at the table. Very nice touch! The manager that was on duty introduced himself and also apologized for the previous poor experiences. Our waiter, Justin, was awesome! We never had an empty drink, his timing was always perfect, and the candle he put in the brownie dessert was also a very nice touch! The steaks were also cooked perfectly this first try this time! Overall, we were extremely satisfied with our most recent experience and will return to enjoy another meal at 131. Thank you Billy!",

Cedar plank salmon was some of the best I've had anywhere.   Crab cake salad was awesome as well.  QF selection desserts were excellent - and ginormous!   Overall great dinner at a great value.",

    "text": "Tonight was our 3rd experience here at 131 Main Blakeney and I must say that each experience gets better and better.   Upon arriving tonight the bartender, Andrea, remembered our drink order and promptly made it. Granted it's only been 2 days, but still remembering our drinks with the volume they do is pretty remarkable. So, as we enjoyed our cocktails, Andrea and Jordan scoped us out a seat at the bar so we could join them for dinner.  We returned tonight because of our amazing experience Wednesday evening. On that trip we sat in the main dining room after having drinks at the bar. In the dining room, Ben was our server. He was top notch. He had great recommendations and delivered the menu beautifully. I could see why he was training a young lady that evening. On that evening, we enjoyed a fresh fish feature in which Ben described phenomenally. The chef really outdid himself with this feature. It was very tasty.   Also throughout our experience Wednesday and this evening we witnessed \"team service\" at its best. Between the two of us we have close to 40 years of experience in the industry, so I believe we have the expertise to acknowledge when a place/staff is doing it right and when it's off... I do have to say that this place is spot on.   So, back to this evening. We decided to go into 131 Main because we were in the area running errands and wanted a drink/quick bite. We decided to eat at the bar because we felt a bit underdressed for their dining room on a Friday night. Upon walking in, again, we were instantly welcomed by Andrea, who also remembered our drinks. Upon sitting at the end of the bar, we had a wonderful seared artichoke app. I highly recommend. For entrees my wife had the smoke salmon app and I had a red snapper (blackened upon Andreas recommendation) and grits which was out of this world. This was another chef feature. (I recommend asking the features upon any visit.) After enjoying our dinners, we were interested in after dinner/dessert drinks. This is where Jordan came in and stole the show. Now we aren't too big on sweet/dessert drinks, but on an a rare occasion they can be nice. Tonight my wife wanted a dessert martini and man did Jordan deliver. He made a signature cookies and cream martini which blew her socks off. It was tasty. Hell she had 2. That's the biggest complement.   Again this evening we experienced the \"team service\" atmosphere. That makes any establishment run smoother and makes any guest have a better experience. This place does it well. The service manager, Nick, has this staff working well.   With a great front of the house staff paired with a well executed menu this place is the tops. They've got lifelong regulars with us now. We'll see you there...",

I ordered the Thai Steak Salad and imagined a bed of greens with light noodles, steak, and cabbage.  It was the complete opposite from what I expected and it couldn't have been better!  Noodles made up the base of the dish along with cabbage, steak (cooked to your preference - medium rare for me), and a nice portion of avocado and mango, all on top.  The hostess was very personable and jotted down the names of two friends who had not arrived when we got there, so she was able to show them exactly where we were seated.  Despite the uncertainty of knowing where the front door was, which seemed to be on the opposite side of the main parking, it was a great lunch spot that I'd like to try this place for dinner sometime soon.",

Almost identical menu, decor, and service pattern.  Eating at 131 Main was like a trip back home.    Being a recent Charlotte transplant I have been looking for that consistent contemporary American restaurant that the wife and I can always fall back on for those on the whim date nights.  Houston's and Hillstone was that for us back home, so let's see if 131 Main can fill that void we having been looking for in Charlotte.    For this first visit we went in for an early dinner, 5:30 or so.   Service started off slow, I could see the servers in pre-shift with only the bartender as our server.  But once there was help, we were able to get our drinks refilled and apps ordered.  +2.    From there on it seemed like a typical Houston's experience.  Apps, salads, and entrees tasted great, but not quite as much attention to detail as Houston's.  +1  But it was well spaced and paced; not as rushed as Houston's, where your entrees can come out half way into your salad.  +2  All said, 3 cocktails, two apps, two salads, ribs, filet, and dessert to take home all for around $125.  A lot cheaper than Houston's in Calufornia. +3  I think we might have found our next regular spot.  Will update again in a couple months.",

Here's what I liked:    - The ambience    - The wait staff - very attentive and friendly    - Grilled Flounder was cooked and seasoned perfectly    - The accompanying Aioli with the Trout was fantastic    - The Meatloaf was unique tasting with a nice crispy crust and tasty center    - Cornbread appetizer was very large and was pretty good    - Homemade Creamy Garlic salad dressing was outstanding!   Here's what I didn't like:    - Appetizers were few (need more variety and offerings)    - Double Dip appetizer - Pimento Cheese was not mixed thoroughly as every bite seemed different - either overly flavorful or just bland!     - Tortilla Chips just didn't seem a good pairing with the Pimento Cheese. Chips were good with Guacamole, but think a pita chip or some type cracker would of been better.     - In the side salad the red cabbage was so bitter that it over powered every bite I took and made the salad almost inedible - dressing was great     - I ordered Trout and it just came out on the plate, with no side or anything accompanying it.  When I asked, the waitress was like oh yeah, it should come with rice or broccoli.  Shouldn't someone of noticed just a piece of fish alone on the plate before it was sent out?     - The person that ordered Meatloaf asked for Fries (not mashed potatoes) and his plate arrived with the Mashed.  Informed waitress and  he eventually got a side order of fries.    ++ that's 2 orders out of 4 that came out wrong!  At a restaurant like this that shouldn't happen.      Yes I would go back at some point, but there are many places I want to try before I give them another chance.",

Our reservation was for 7:30 and it was already packed. The bar area was insane. We were quickly seated and greeted by a great, animated waiter who gave us a great run down of the menu and drinks. I ordered a cocktail with deep Eddy's and firefly and hubby got a beer. My cocktail was excellent. For appetizers we ordered deviled eggs and guac. The portion sizes for this whole restaurant week meal were HUGE. Both appetizers were delicious, and I did a terrible job pacing myself. For entrees I ordered the salmon and husband got the ribs. The ribs were amazing! The salmon I ordered was also delectable, with a great mustard sauce and rice salad on the side. I was not able to finish much of it but hubby killed the ribs. For dessert we ordered the brownie with ice cream and the peanut butter pie. Both were amazing! We ate the ice cream brownie at the restaurant and took the peanut butter pie to go, it was great the next day! I love the ambiance in there and the waiter and waitress team were perfect. The manager even came by and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit, we will definitely be back soon! After this amazing meal, we passed out on the floor at 9:30. A Friday night to remember!",

The Cobb salad is very very good- excellent blend of chicken avocado bacon croutons..and sometimes in salads I just leave the croutons but these are so good and have a unique shape and flavor that screams home made.  The cornbread is thick and textured but tastes light...very decadent with the honey, it is dessert like.  My friend had a crab cake which she said was excellent.",

    "text": "Sad to say I was racially discriminated here. It kind of felt like I was on the wrong side of town. We walked in the restaurant quietly and sat down. The waiter rudely didn't even mention her name and just went on to ask us what we wanted to drink. She didn't even want to make eye contact with me as I was giving her my order. She would either look over my head or in some other direction my way but not directly at me. This type of body movement and behavior was being noticed so it was pretty bad.We had been sitting there so long with the menu that we already knew what we wanted to order so we did. We placed our order. My friend off the back told me that the waiter did not want to serve us and that she had an attitude. I didn't catch it at first but I let her continue On. When the waiter came back she said, \"if you didn't put your order in already I would have told you the specials\" (in her snappy voice as if i did something wrong for knowing my order after they took 15 minutes getting to my table).  She clearly overheard our conversation And realized she had messed up and was trying to make up. We listened to the specials and said thank you. I asked for some complementary bread because we were starving and I had a feeling it was going to be a wait. Boom! Server gone! Another server came around and introduced herself and said she will be taking over her table. It was just about 9 o'clock on the dot and we thought the other server had gone home and tried not to jump to conclusions. We also paid attention to the other waitresses who were waiting around us and the rotation of their tables. Our new server was very pleasant and handled all of our needs and requests.  At the end of our meal as we were receiving our checks, I asked our new waiter why did we receive a new waiter. This chick had the nerve to tell me some BS and say that they rotate waitresses as if that's even possible. She was saying one person will get the drinks, and one person will take the food order. This was totally BS and no way possible all this could work in restaurant because it's too damn confusing!! You'll be yelling around the room hey Ashley did you get my drinks hey Sam did you get the cheese sticks?? After that dumbass answer I was completely over the restaurant and really figured that we were in the wrong side of town. Ha! What's funny is, our original waitress with helping another table across from us! I know I'm black, but I'm not ghetto. I know why am black, but we were going to tip you. I know why am black, but I deserve good service too.",

The service is always stellar and the food hasn't disappointed at all on a normal outing with my family or with my girlfriends.  The only reason I must provide 3 stars is because there is no 3.5 star option. I had my birthday dinner here last year and made the reservations about 3 months in advance and after arriving it took forever to get our orders taken as we sat for 35 minutes before ordering, another hour to get the food and another 45-1hour to get the cake brought it which had everyone extremely tired from the long drawn out dinner and not interested in going out afterwards per the agenda. Plus our several was having a OFF night lets just leave that there as I don't like to put people out there if I had another experience with them and it was better and this is the case with the server in question. My go to meal has always been the Shrimp and Grits minus the pork. The husband and I have also done the dinner for two which is 3 courses and wine which was a great deal while out on date night. Unfortunately I haven't been able to experience the firepit as its ALWAYS taken when I arrive especially on Half Price wine Wednesday (I think it's Wednesday). Once I experience that I may update my review with better info and it may sway my STARrage .",

Waitress was nice,  professional  , and great service. Got the ribeye, cooked perfect med well. French fries for the side, which are tiny shoestring fries, come on give me a baked potato that they do not offer. I do not think I would go back. To many other restaurants with better food.",

    "text": "We decided to have dinner one random Monday and I was neither over nor under wowed. Before going I called to make reservations, and first was told they didn't have anything available until and hour and 30 minutes after the time I requested. When I told them I didn't want to wait that late, I would find something else they made reservations for the time I requested. Once we arrived we were seated immediately, I noticed the restaurant was kind of empty so I was confused by the person taking reservations. After we were seated and placed our drink order, we were asked to move to another table because they reserved that table for a bigger party. It was 5 of us, we moved across the restaurant which was not only an inconvenience it was uncomfortable, with the other patrons watching. As for the food, we started with appetizers the queso cheese and guacamole was good, everyone enjoyed. My cocktail was good not too weak, and had a smooth taste. I took the waiters recommendation and ordered the catch of the day \"wild fish\" and 2 sides. Based on the price $36 the portions size for the  fish was ridiculous, there was only one filet. Being I didn't like the sides I ordered, I finished my fish really quick and was still hungry. My son ordered a kids meal cheeseburger, the burger was huge. It was fit for an adult he barely touched it. Now my companion order slow roasted chicken and enjoyed it along with the fries. I won't say this experience made it a definite no go, but 131 Main wouldn't be my 1st, 2nd nor 3rd choice. I'm not hard to please, however Based on the reviews, I expected a better experience.",

I mean people who can put that much love into fast food, must be able to do wonders at a \"real\" restaurant right?  Thank god I was not disappointed.  We chose 131 Main for our Easter lunch.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and clearly well trained.  We ordered a half order of the double dip for an appetizer. It is a plate of tortilla chips served with fresh guacamole, salsa and pimento cheese.  The pimento cheese was incredible, guac was great and the salsa just okay.  The half was the perfect size for two.   Hubs had meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  Both were awesome.  I ordered the crab cake salad.  OMG - yummy!  Full of crab with no visible filler at all.  Not sure how they even get the crab cake to keep it's shape.  It's served with a mustard sauce that looks like it will be overpowering, but it is perfect.  Cornbread croutons are a nice touch.  Oddly enough, the highlight of the meal was probably the cheeseburger from my sons kids' meal.  Crazy I know!!!  It was a large burger so hubs and I tried it and it was incredible.  The flavor of the beef was awesome.  I never order a cheese burger at a restaurant and I could actually see myself ordering a cheeseburger there.  Fries were fresh cut and great.  Why doesn't every place just make fresh fries.  Really!!  They taste so, so, so much better.  The kids meals were topped finished off with Eskimo Pies.  My kids want to eat there every day.  I saw many people ordering the brunch specials which were french toast or eggs benedict with a crab cake.  Both looked incredible.    From the outside, the building is beautiful and if you didn't know the food was quite reasonably priced, you might think you were in a super fancy place.  Might intimidate some.  The interior is gorgeous as well.  Would be a great date location or place to impress clients.",

    "text": "I had the fried flounder the other night and it was really good.  Nice texture on the fish, and the breading seems related to the cornbread that pops up in many places on the menu.  Although they serve it with a nice, home-made tartar sauce, it covered up the tasty fish and seemed unnecessary.  My wife loves the Roast Beef Sandwich here.  I had the \"Main\" salad and felt there was way too much red cabbage in it, but that is a personal thing and it is large enough that eating just what I wanted was plenty.  On previous trips I have tried the deviled egg appetizer and wasn't a fan, even though I really wanted to be.  I never have room for dessert, and I am sure that I am missing out.  Nice atmosphere and waitstaff.  On my first trip here the waitress performed my favorite restaurant trick.  She asked for our drink orders and then proceeded to tell us about the specials and answer questions.  While doing this, the drinks were magically delivered by another waiter to us.  How the heck did they do this?  Not that magical really, but a nice touch--she wrote them down, held the card behind her back as she explained things.  The next waiter by grabbed the card and filled the order.  They do this so seemlessly that it seems like magic.  I hope that I didn't ruin it for anyone.  :)  My least favorite restaurant trick?  Where the waiter \"remembers\" the orders.  Hey Kreskin, I am here for dinner, not a kid's birthday party.  If it works I am not impressed, and if it doesn't I am pissed.  At 131 Main they write it down.",

He never introduced himself as the waiter and just brought water to our table and asked is there any thing else you want to drink , then disappeared for 20 mins . Then came back and asked \"you ready \" ?  I was seriously puzzled I've never seen a waiter like this at 131. With it being restaurant week maybe he just didn't care.  I started to request for management but my date did not want me to make a scene .  The food was amazing as always but this waiters service hit a sour note.  In addition I'm handicapped  and only have one hand , and while I witnessed others dinners being boxed up Nate simply placed the boxes on the razor and kept walking .   This really ruined a place I loved to dine at . I ordered the ribeye and red cabbage it was cooked perfectly .  Food 5 stars this waiter one star hence the 3 star review",

    "text": "So, my boyfriend and I have been here 3 times now. The first time I got the crab cakes which were excellent. The second and third times here, I got the shrimp and grits. It is a little pricey at $19 but it was excellent on our second visit. The third visit however was quite a mess. When they brought our food, mine was poorly played with very little Creole sauce and a very haphazard looking plate. When the waitress came by,I asked her if it was supposed to look like this and she took it back to the kitchen. They obviously had to cook another dish entirely as it took at least 15 minutes for the new plating. It was better when they brought out the new entree; however, my boyfriend was already finished with his fish tacos so our experience of dining together was ruined. So once again, MANAGERS, if you diner experiences a screw up, attempt to offer them something to make up for YOUR lack of oversight. The dish was replaced satisfactorily so no need to come the entree but at the very least, you could have offered us dessert on the house, with a sincere apology. I saw managers viewing the food going out of the kitchen. I suppose they missed my entree. Do not know if we will return considering the overall lack of concern with inconsistent and poor playing.",

    "text": "My lady and I decided to jump in to restaurant week head first with a much anticipated visit to 131 Main in the Blakeney area off Rea Rd. Not necessarily an easy find off the main road as it's a standalone building right beside a rather large shopping complex, but it is a good looking location nonetheless with spacious seating both indoors and out. We already had reservations for 5:30pm on a Sunday evening (right in the middle of conference championship Sunday in the NFL, talk about sacrifice LoL) so we got in at a great time as it was much lighter volume of folks when we got there than when we left. The mood was intimate, adult atmosphere one suitable for a date. We started off with one lady waitress who took our drink order and broke down the menu but then she vanished and we magically got a male waitress for the remainder of our experience which a little odd but not off putting as they both were very attentive to our needs.  I've participated in restaurant week in Charlotte many times over the years because it can be a great way to eat fancy while maximizing your wallet. My only fear is that some establishments seem to use it as an excuse to offer scaled back, sub-par portions and\\or quality for their offerings on special. Saying that, I'm pleased to report that 131 main did not fall into this trap. Their special for the week included a glass of wine (red or white) so we both got white which turned out to be a semi sweet pinot grigio which paired very well with the entrees on the list. For appetizers we elected to grab the double dip chips (guacamole\\cheese dip combo with a side of salsa and fresh tortilla chips) and deviled eggs. Those two items along nearly spoiled my appetite splitting up 4 jumbo eggs and hearty basket of chips that we cleaned out which is the official seal of approval. For our main entree she went with salmon (came with a kale salad side) and I went with prime rib (mashed potatoes on the side) Everything was very fresh and tasty. Meat fell right of the bone. The kale salad (which we admittedly both had our doubts about) turned out to be quite a hit. They gave me a cup of gravy to go with my mashed potatoes which I used to slightly dilute a thick serving. My plate also came with a creamy, horseradish type of sauce that we both avoid like the plague as it was much too strong for our taste buds. For desert she got a brownie and I got the key lime pie and by this time we were already running out of room in our bellys. To my chagrin, they bring out the most gut busting slice of key lime I've ever seen topped with mountains of whipped cream and graham cracker crumbles. The brownie was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, peanuts and drizzled in blend of chocolate\\caramel. All in all, we both left feeling very satisfied with our experience.  Certainly deserving of its reputation and a place I'd be willing to visit again for a fine dining experience.",

It is in a shopping center area on Rea Rd but the building has some nice architectural details and effort put into the look and feel.  The inside is very comfortable and calming and matches well with the exterior.  The service was also very responsive and polished.  I guess their cuisine would be considered new American.  Dishes were simple staples with some minor surprises, and everything I had was well executed.  I had the house salad, which was excellent, and grilled salmon on a cedar plan with a wild rice salad.  Everything tasted very fresh and was refined with a little twist.  The banana creme pie was phenomenal and I would highly recommend.",

I recognize the faster tables are turned over the more money the establishment makes but I should not be rushed when me and my guest are spending about  $150 for a meal and drinks.   In no way did we feel welcome to linger over the meal.  We didn't have our entree for 5 minutes before being asked whether we wanted dessert.  The checking in by the wait staff made it very clear they wanted us too wrap up our meal including no offers for a new drink.  Again the food is great but the rush job was incredibly frustrating.

    "text": "Walking into this restaurant will catch you off guard, I was not expecting such a great layout when I walked in.  The bar was hopping and business was very steady even on a weeknight.  The food was fabulous!  I had the meatloaf and it was definitely something to die for.  If you have never had cucumber salad, you have to try it at 131 Main!  Service was excellent, the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and the daily specials.  The only thing I don't like about the place is that it is really hard to have a conversation.  The layout seems to have a hole in the air sucking out your voice, I felt as though I had to repeat myself over and over just to make a conversation.  Overall my satisfaction with 131 Main is over-the-top.  131 Main would get a 5-star rating if I would have been able to carry on a conversation without being drowned out by the noise.  I will be back!",

I order it with extra avocado.  Also highly recommend the scallop appetizer. Yummy!!!  And Tuesday's are half priced bottles - as in any of the bottles. GREAT deal.

For my meal I got the prime rib sandwich since they don't serve regular prime rib during the week. Another disappointment if that's your special item. Got to be honest the sandwich was terrible, so much bread and the prime rib didn't have much flavor which the cheese really have it all the taste. Super underwhelmed by it. Horsy sauce was also bland, wish it had a little spice to you. After two tries I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.",

My husband and I looked over the restaurant week menus and chose 131 Main for the ribs.  When I went to order the ribs, they were sold out!  I will say that I was disappointed, but didn't let it ruin my experience at the fantastic restaurant.    We had: Caesar Salad & Deviled Eggs Appetizers Ribeye and French Fries Entree  Strawberry Shortcake and Brownie Desserts  *Everything was excellent.  Pre-warning, if you like sweet desserts, the strawberry shortcake is on a biscuit which is very salty, not a typical strawberry shortcake dessert.  The Brownie was AMAZING and enough for 2 or 3 people to share.    The atmosphere inside the restaurant is so cozy, warm and inviting.  It's really a perfect spot for a date night, celebration dinner or get together with friends.  I enjoyed it immensely.  The service was fantastic, friendly and prompt.  The management team was visible, helpful and friendly.  I will definitely be back to try the ribs another time!",

Took one star off for food and drinks - they weren't bad but not as good as I had expected. Hubby seemed happy with his crab cakes and grits, but my dirty Tito martini was almost all olive juice  - I order martinis for the vodka people, and got not even a twinge of a buzz (although I love me those blue cheese olives..should've just ordered a bowl of those and skipped the drink!). Also my salad was tasty but overdressed and a little soggy. But again, nothing was bad, and the portions were very large. Would most definitely return.",

We love the smoked salmon appetizer, as a meal, and the roast beef sandwich is truly awesome, ask for some raw horseradish to kick up the mayo (get both on the side and mix em up!) Not a fan of shoestring fries, so I usually sub them out for their garlicky kale salad. Truth be told, I have done take out before of 3 orders of just the side of kale salad for a full meal! I do wish they would change up their menu soon, while we love the staples we always get, nothing has changed on the menu in quite some time. Their salads are also good, and I think their pricing pretty fair. The only con I have to say is that if you are a small party, and maybe it's just me, but I feel like they really rush you through your meal to turn the table. We prefer to sit at the bar or the booths beside the bar to avoid this rushed feeling.",

The best part of the meal was the smashed potatoes.  The appetiizer cornbread started off looking good but after about 3 bites my taste buds were puzzled wondering if this was cake, bread, or a sorry attempt at making a fruit cake.  We both got P:rime Rib and my jaw muscles began to cramp up and I ended up having to spit out some of the meat because I just couldn't chew it!  The meat was absolutely some of the toughest beef I have ever tried to eat including steaks purchased from Food Lion in the reduced price section.  I got the caeser salad and the dressing was bland and lacked taste.  Very disappointing meal and I wont be wasting my money on this 131 joint anymore,  If you are planning to go for Goodness sake don't get any beef unless you are a gum chewing champion.  If you want a steak go across the street East Blvd, and go to Outback.  Pretty sad food for sure.",

It is so noisy we couldn't even hear each other. I couldn't' wait to get back outside!!  We prefer going out to dine - not just going out to get something to eat. The clientele has changed - it is more of a bar atmosphere.  The wait was much longer than we expected and the management missed the opportunity to recognize the many people that came in, but left immediately because of the long wait!  Management needs to recognize the people that made an effort to come to their restaurant even though they couldn't offer them a seat.",

This is brilliant for this area, you can only eat at the restaurants in blakeny so many times before you tire of them.  131 keeps you coming back to see what they have changed!

    "text": "My experience actually spurred me to finally register for Yelp after years of surfing it for reviews here in CLT and everywhere we have gone in our travels.  Full disclosure...we did not make it past water.  My mother's birthday is this weekend.  My folks like to have a late lunch when having a big meal (its restaurant week)...around 2PM.  My mom also loves her some Prime Rib; its her staple.  Not many upscale places serve it for lunch.  Browsed the restaurant week listings and there we go - 131 Main has Prime Rib on the docket.  We live north on Rea by 485, so this is close and we have always wanted to give the place a try ever since we moved here just under two years ago.  Called over a week in advance.  Spoke to a nice young lady who placed me on hold and confirmed we would be good at 2 for restaurant week menu and noted it in our reservation.  Cool!  Called today at 11:50 to confirm reservation and restaurant week menu.  Yepper, we have you down and restaurant week menu will be available if requested for lunch and see you have it noted so you should be good sir.  Anyone have a guess where this is heading?  Buehler?  We get there on time for our reservation and were told sorry sir we are not prepared yet for restaurant week.  I request a manager to discuss.  Tell him what is happening and what I did to make sure this very thing did not happen to us on my mother's birthday.  He asks if there anything else on the menu he can provide us...I know the guy was trying but you are an upscale place.  Recognize that you screwed this event up for us and pull me aside.  Tell me this kind of thing does not happen and ask to give them another chance to make it right. Tell me to ask for him when we come back and he will make sure we have a great experience.  I know we will come back to 131 Main eventually to give it another shot; too many good reviews and its so close to Piper.  But I have to express my absolute disappointment in this situation and the way we were handled.",

I'll be honest, previous to this I hadn't been too excited to try them because their menu didn't look that appealing to me. I'd saw a lot of reviews about the cornbread so I brought that up when we discussed appetizers. The cornbread was pretty good. It was definitely not your mommas! Very different, but still decent. They have honey on the table to eat with it which enhanced the flavor in my opinion. I doubt i'd order it again. I ordered the potato soup & the Big Island Ribeye and both MORE THAN made up for what was lacking in the cornbread. That was probably the best Potato Soup and Ribeye that i'd ever tasted. The potato soup was enhanced from your typical potato soup. I wanted more! And with the ribeye the marinade was not too think. And you could taste the marinade through the steak. It was tender and just excited my palate. I literally can not wait to return and order it again. Service was also awesome. Our server was friendly, quick and attentive. The ambience was nice and relaxed. Walking in was a bit weird. I didn't know which was the main door but I figured it out. This definitely wasn't the type of place that i'd be comfortable walking in with Jeans and a T-Shirt on. It was a bit stiff. But all that really matter is the food and that will be the reason why I return.",

The wait was not wasted, as we were able to relax at the bar for a while. The Chocolate Noir Martini is to die for!! Once we received the text message alerting us that our table was ready, we crossed the beautifully lit dining room. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We decided on the Cornbread and the Double Dip for our appetizers. Both were delicious. The salads were great as well, especially the Caesar salad. It was the best around!! For dinner, I chose the Prime Rib, which was outstanding!!  My husband went with the special, which was Mahi Mahi fresh from the coast of Brazil which was another perfect choice. We were very excited and impressed to learn that everything cooked and prepared at 131 Main is 100% fresh, never frozen. Our waitress was wonderful from the moment she approached, until the moment we left for the evening. All in all, our evening was wonderful, start to finish. 131 Main was the perfect location to celebrate the end of one happy, healthy year, and welcome another!",

    "text": "My husband and I went to 131 Main on Saturday night for our Anniversary Dinner, we'd been a  few times before but never for dinner, only lunch. I started with the Pearfection martini- it was delicious, so good I had another with dinner. Our starter was the double-dip. It's a trio of pimento cheese, guacamole and salsa with corn chips. It was also really good, the pimento especially so. Where things started going south were with our main courses. My husband got the \"Big Island' Ribeye and asked for it to be cooked medium. When it arrived, it was cold and red inside and seared to a crisp on the outside. Extremely rare. He tried to eat it, but a few bites in, had to send it back. Meanwhile, my cedar planked salmon seemed to be going great. Well seasoned, the wild rice salad that came with it was great. However, when I cut into the middle of my salmon, I was bummed to see that it was also extremely under-cooked. I can eat a medium salmon, but this was fleshy and cold - ick. I ended up having to send it back too. What surprised me the most, was when my husbands steak came back.... it was the same steak! They put it in the oven and cooked it until it was well done. I couldn't believe my eyes, I've never seen someone not re-fire a fresh steak. There's no way a steak can retain it's moisture after being cooked once, rested, cut into, and then 10-15 minutes later thrown back into an oven! The same with my salmon. They took my salmon and put it back in the oven to cook further. Which resulted in it being extremely dry, especially on the outside portions. Our waitress was great when we first arrived, but then seemed to deflate as the night went on. I kept trying to reiterate to her that we didn't blame her but she just seemed detached and like she couldn't wait for us to leave. I hate when people blame the wait staff on their food not being well so I made a point to reassure her, but she didn't seem to care. She had the manager comp our dinners which was very kind, but I honestly would've rather paid the $104 for a well prepared anniversary dinner, than the $40 something we spent on drinks and apps.   Unfortunately, we won't be going back.",

The quality of the food is very consistent, & any modifications or changes to a menu item are always happily entertained. Most times, a manager is circulating & stops at each table to ask how everything is & if there is anything they can do to make our meal even better. I always appreciate that personal touch. The only negative thing I'd say is to agree with some other reviewers that the cedar plank salmon tends to be undercooked. Since it is my favorite item on the menu, I simply now ask for it to be cooked \"medium well\" & that takes care of the (usually) raw center. Other than that, 131 Main is dining perfection!",

My advice to anyone would be to NEVER have crab cakes outside of Maryland. Seriously, NEVER.  One note is beware of any thing not on the menu, the cost can be a bit more than the range on the menu. For example, the hostess told us the specials and one was a good $20 higher than what was on the menu! Having said that, being from NY, I know for a fact our bill would have been twice as high even with what we had.  Take the ride and stop in, you won't regret it.",

A better steak then the Capital Grill and half the price.  My date has severe medical dietary restrictions, so I called ahead to ask about their menu and the receptionist said the server would have information available when we arrived.  I made an appointment the evening before for 6:45 and then I changed it to 8 with no problem. (The Masserati parked out front with a dealer decal on the door is tacky, but the rest isn't snooty or haughty at all.)  We arrived at 8:05 and were seated immediately.  There were only two people waiting in the lobby and the dining room was not full, and this was Saturday night. We were seated at a table for two across from each other and it would have been nice to be side by side.  Also, the noise level is a bit much; it wouldn't hurt if they put up some drapes to reduce the din.  The server delivered menus quickly and returned to take our order quite soon.  I had the steak with pinapple glaze which was epic, and I've lived in Kansas so I know a good steak and I've lived in Hawaii so I know pineapples too.  I like my steak done, not mooing, and ordered it medium-well and that is just what I got not some burnt outside raw inside piece of charcoal from a cook too full of himself.  But enough about me.  My date explained her restrictions to our server and he explained what the kitchen could do to accommodate her and even checked with the kitchen and returned quickly with an answer.  My date completely enjoyed her meal as well by the look of her plate when done.  If you are looking for a nice restaurant in Ballantyne, look no further.  I originally looked up 131 Main based on a recommendation from a hotel clerk, and she deserves my thanks for the suggestion.  (If you're wondering, celiac and lactose intolerant. No digestion distress following dinner.)",

My server was Ben and I must say his hospitality and service was impeccable! He made my birthday even happier not to mention the unexpected gift shared with me from the establishment. I highly recommend 131 Main-Blakeney and please request Ben you will not be disappointed! A Birthday well Celebrated! Thank you 131 Main for making me even happier on my day.",

Our server came over within five minutes and we placed an order for our drinks. It took 30 minutes for three cocktails to arrive! In the meantime, we had ordered food, drank our water, and were just sitting there waiting. The first round of cocktails arrived completely incorrect, and it took another 15 minutes for the next round to come. I find this restaurant to be completely overrated and overpriced. We won't be coming back.",

Both the restaurant week menu and regular menu we're available to order from.  I chose to order from the restaurant week menu. I started my meal with the house salad with their housemadd creamy garlic dressing. The salad was fresh and the dressing had good flavor. For my main course I chose the Maryland Crab Cakes with a side of fries. The crab cakes were decent but not a great, they were a little fishy tasting for my liking. The fries were delicious, shoestring fries with a great seasoning mix on them. For dessert, I had the brownie with ice cream; the brownie was almost like eating fudge, it was topped with an assortment of nuts. I found it to be very rich and could only eat a little, taking the rest home. I also tried a friend's peanut butter pie.....if you like peanut butter, this was wonderful.  Service was decent but not exceptional.       131 Main does allow you to bring your own bottle of wine with no corkage fee, this is always a plus in my book!",

The waitress left 2 glasses on the counter, and opened the bottle.  She walked away, and didn't pour the water.  A couple of minutes later, she packed up and left for the night.  I guess there was no need to pour the water because she wouldn't be around to get the tip.  At 9:30pm, the lights in the restaurant turned off.  Seriously?  We were still eating dinner at the bar, and may have liked a glass of wine.  There was no-one behind the bar.  The message was obvious....., we're closing...., time to finish up!  My husband and I have been going regularly to 131 Main for the last 11 years.  To this day, not a single worker; waitress, bar tender, or manager knows my name or that of my husband's.

The grilled artichokes are amazing and while some would discount the cornbread appetizer I implore you to try it. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with bits of cheese and corn and it's served with warm honey! The Filet is cooked to order and each member of the party ordered different and all  can exactly as we wanted.

I really wanted to like this place, but there were too many mistakes with my meal.  For appetizers, the devil's eggs were very good. The cornbread was too dry and burnt on the top.   Although there were some misses with the cornbread, I did enjoy the house salad very much. It was refreshing, had great texture, and the greens were very fresh.  For dinner, i ordered the Maryland crab cakes. The crab cakes were very fresh and was made of real lump crab meat. However, it was very salty and the pool of horseradish tasting sauce cheapened and ruined the taste and quality of the crabcakes. For the side order, i substituted the fries for the wild rice salad. PLEASE do not get the wild rice!! It is wayyyy undercooked even though it had great potential especially with the cuurants, cherries, and curry flavor in it. 3 people at my table ordered it and we all didn't eat it! The rice was too hard to chew down.  For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake and that was truly amazing. I liked the sweetness of the strawberries paired with the breadier shortcake.  Overall, i give 131 main 2 stars for its service and dessert. I guess I was there at an off night, but I will get something else next time and give it another try.",

    "text": "Our eternal search for stand-out gluten-free dining brought us to 131 Main and while there were some bumps in the road, it was a pretty solid experience.  Fair warning, though, on a Saturday evening it is LOUD.  I'm talking order a glass of ice water or you will walk out with a raspy voice LOUD.    Salad: the ginger dressing had a nice little kick (gluten-free) and the creamy garlic was stellar (not gluten-free)  Mains: the ribs were fall-off-the-bone good, although a little too saucy (gluten-free), the prime rib was the winner of the table (not gluten-free) with the cedar plank salmon coming in a close second (gluten-free).  The crab cakes were good at first bite but proved to be too salty to finish (not gluten-free).  Sides: Shoestring french fries were classic (gluten-free), the coleslaw was fine (gluten-free), the smashed potatoes were solid but too much when accompanied by prime rib (not gluten-free) and the seasonal vegetable - asparagus - was very well prepared although we couldn't figure out why they felt it necessary to add breadcrumbs (also rendering them not-gluten-free).  The 'team' approach to service was a little frustrating with meals arriving at different times, the wrong items going to the wrong people (not to beat a dead breadcrumb, but that is problematic when dealing with dietary allergies) and a glass of wine arriving after the check was presented.  Overall, worth going back to, but maybe at a less hectic hour...",

By 7:50 they told us that the previous diners were still at the table and they couldn't give us a time.  By 8:15 (still not seated) two of us had to leave because we had to work and there was no way would would be seated and eat by 9 - all in all, very very very poor management.  I will never go back here and would be hesitant if you make a reservation with them - what is the point of a reservation if you have to wait an hour?",

One is deviled eggs (is it Thanksgiving dinner at my Aunt's house??). Then there's cornbread (no, I want an appetizer not something I get for free at the local diner...). Smoked salmon and seared tuna?? Hmmmm, no really where are the real appetizers?! They do have a mean cheese dip (you can keep the green snot....guoc!) but really that's pitiful! I am still looking for that great entree...had a filet here once and it was decent but not worth $30. The smashed reds were terrible. Zero flavor! Like, add some milk and butter possibly some salt and pepper....anything??? Incredible ambience (view) but could not be louder- bad acoustics... I can't hang my hat on mean cheese dip...please get better 131 Main Lastly....they have a roast beef sandwich some people rave about....I would rave about it as well if it included CHEESE! Seriously, what roast beef sandwich that you dip in \"Ju\" has no cheese??? It's not American and quite frankly embarrassing....",

    "text": "Went for lunch on the suggestion of someone in a local accessories store who gave me a \"free appetizer\" card. She suggested the smoked salmon app and it was delicious!!! It was moist and tender and smoky and glistening with that salmony richness. It came with toast points and a really nice aioli. Yummo!! Big piece, too!  I actually could've had that for lunch with a couple glasses of wine and would've been perfect. But I just didn't want to order that since it was free.  I didnt wanna look like a cheap ass. So I would've the crabcakes that came on top of greens with a creamy mustard sauce and that was delicious too!! The crabcake was big and full of lumps of delicious white crabmeat in the mix green salad was a nice size and had a delicious vinaigrette on it. I got roped into desert by the waitress and I was a little disappointed with that. It was a banana cream pie but it didn't taste like it was real banana cream it tasted like that custard sweet stuff and the whip cream was definitely not real whip cream. It might've been a mixture of whip cream and something else just to hold it so it doesn't dissolve and fall and lose all the air. There was however a very loud customer that was sitting with other people and she was never told to shut her giant hyena laughing ass up. It was very distracting and annoying and I can't even believe that the restaurant tolerated that without going over to her and telling her to tone that shit down. If it had been dinner and this was not addressed I would've gone over to the manager and told him how disappointed I was. Overall however I definitely would go back again and try what's on the dinner menu. Next time I'll be hoping the hyena doesn't show up again",

I had the prime rib sandwich with their coleslaw...which has an Asian influence and was very good.  The prime rib sandwich was hands down the best prime rib sandwich I've ever had.  Their dip and creamy horseradish sauce put it over the top.  A little messy to eat so maybe not best choice for a first date....my my fiance did not seem to mind as she was too busy enjoying her food.   We will be back!",

    "text": "I hate to give this place 2 stars, since the food was really delicious, but I must do so for a couple of reasons:  1.  No bread or water was given right away.  This is a huge no-no in restaurant etiquette.  The waitress asked me if I wanted water after I ordered my alcoholic beverage, which I found odd.  One star deduction.  2.  I ordered the grilled asparagus and crab cake salad.  The asparagus was too salty, and the crab cake salad was very tasty, but the portion size was awful.  You get ONE crab cake (two would have been preferable), and the salad portion was severely lacking in size.  My mother got a Cobb salad, which had a significantly larger salad portion.  In addition, I only got ONE crouton.   One crouton, one crab cake, and scanty salad?  Two-star mega deduction right there.  3.  For the final one-star deduction, I was curious as to what town the restaurant was located in (being from New York and all).  Would you believe that the waitress had no clue??  She had to go ask someone else!  Now if you're from North Carolina and you also work there, I would imagine that you should know exactly where you are.  This waitress was clueless.  If it's any consolation to the restaurant, definitely order the banana cream pie.  Another reviewer commented on how great it is, and it's True.  It's sumptuous.  P.S.  Another odd thing:  we were served by different people for each aspect of our meal.  One person took our drink order, another person brought the drinks, a different person took our meal order, another person brought out the plates, and (finally) a different person brought out our desserts.  Very, very strange.",

When the plate cost starts to exceed 300% of ingredients (Assumption of top notch crab, beef, etc), understanding overhead costs are a factor,  you have to ask yourself if other factors make up for taxation of folks who either can't cook or don't mind paying extra taxes. Having said that, crab cakes VERY Good (I know maryland..this is a pleasantly a different style, i plan on emulating for a fraction of the cost :) ....Smashed red potatoes, very good!.  beef (Filet and prime rib) mediocre esp. at $30/plate (Run up on valentines day).  All said, the service was the tipping (ha )as thats usually the 'insult to injury', but in 131's case, leans a fiscally conservative person like me going back on special occasions.",

Whenever I have a hard time choosing between 2 or 3 entrees, I love getting server input since they typically know the dishes pretty well and Tara did not steer me wrong.  The food was phenomenal.  I had a seafood special that melted in my mouth. When my son needed a plain piece of bread for his hot dog, instead of focaccia that it is served on, she quickly requested some toasted bread from the kitchen.  It was delivered and my son shared the bread with his sister that was eating a pulled pork dish.  She used the toast to turn her dish into mini sliders.  Tara laughed at her creativity and called her a \"future chef\", which is my daughter's dream.  Upon hearing this, Tara got her a tour of the kitchen - which my 10 yr old daughter just loved.  We had been to 131 Main numerous times before, and always had a great experience, but this one was just over the top awesome and we had such an incredible night. It's great to have a really nice local restaurant that is family friendly too.  We will return - often.",

I have the filet and crab cake special with red mashed potatoes.   The filet was cooked perfect at med rare but the outside was seared to perfection.   The crab cake was also done perfectly with huge lumps of crab meat and little filler. Lastly, the mashed potatoes were thick and very flavorful.   You know your dinner was great when the mashed potatoes are the worst thing on the plate !",

    "text": "We went this past Wednesday for our company's annual Christmas Dinner - Third year in a row we had chosen 131 Main but probably the last.  Partly due to location, partly due to wanting to do something different and partly due to service and quality of food for price offered.  Our waitress was exceptionally pleasant with a terrific personality.  But, she was also quite forgetful.  We had a party of 7 and my wife and I arrived about 20 minutes after the rest of the group due to traffic issues. Water had already been served to the other 5 folks.  When we ordered our drinks, we also requested water.  The water never came.  When I ordered a 2nd beer, the waitress forgot and I had to remind her.  When the entrees arrived, my order omitted the mashed potatoes so I had to ask her to bring.  Another member of our party requested bread for the table when the entrees were served.  The bread never came.  After we were done with dessert, I requested a box from another employee for the balance of our key lime pie.  (Very big piece by the way).  When our waitress came back, I told her I was waiting for a box.  She said \"I'm sure its on the way.\"  About 5-10 minutes later, she came back and I asked again for the box. This time, it came.  As to the food, most of our party was satisfied with their entrees.  One person ordered the ribeye and they commented - nothing special.  They actually said \"Outback has a better ribeye.\"  My wife had the shrimp and grits and loved it.  The apps ordered were cornbread and deviled eggs.  Both excellent.  Key Lime pie we shared was also very good and more than enough for two.  Our 16 year old got to enjoy the rest when we got home.  No manager stopped by the table to ask us about dinner/service.  In a restaurant like this, I am accustomed to a manager doing that.  If 131 reads this, I suggest you make that standard practice - especially for groups of our size.  As we left, the hosts at the front said nothing to us - no \"thanks for coming in\", no \"have a happy holiday\"...",

No system or routine - just making drinks as they come and disappearing for extended periods of time.  Except for iced tea (which takes 10 minutes).  2 stars because the food is good.  2 stars because the service pisses me off to the point of not wanting the good food.  And oh, when I've had a menu in front of my face for any period of time and there are two people working the bar, I shouldn't have to flag anyone down and ask to order - not at a restaurant of this caliber or any restaurant for that matter.",

I am completely obsessed with it now and will judge every other banana cream pie in my life to the one served here at 131 main. The graham crust has a cinnamon  and the bananas a pie are topped with a wonderful caramel sauce. Tons of whip cream to balance the sweetness. What can I just survive eating this the rest of my life?   My night did not start off with dessert as it may appear, I did come into this restaurant with the intention to be healthy and ordered the cob salad. The salad was so delicious. They topped it with grilled chicken, onion, tomato, avocado and the blue cheese vinaigrette. I also ordered a side of their garlic cream sauce to pair with my healthy side order of string cut french fries. As you can tell the diet isn't work out well.   Everything I had here was delicious and the service was spectacular. Our waiter was very attentive and had a great humor. Can't wait to come back when i'm not on a diet ;)  Order the jalapeno cornbread appetizer and drizzle with honey...YUMMM... Gosh I am out of control!",

We had reserved a table so we did not have to wait. The restaurant was packed and somewhat noisy.  The menu, special for Mother's Day, featured their most popular and requested cuisine choices. Everything fresh and nothing frozen.  Some fish we were told flown in over night.  Our orders consisted of rainbow trout with kale salad, I substituted a Caesar  salad instead with a extra surcharge. House salad or Caesar salad $6 extra as a side salad with an entree. Also ordered were rib eye steak with homemade mashed  red potatoes, seared scallops with cheesy grits, wild mushroom artichoke soup, desserts of strawberry short cake and  a signature dessert of banana cream pie.  Everything was delicious, plated attractively, good portions, came out hot and moderately priced. Soup was creamy and tasty, steak cooked to order,  trout tender, scallops just slightly peppery for one of the diners, grits and potatoes yummy. The salads great with plenty of  delicious dressing. The desserts large enough for two people to share. Ice cream over cake over strawberries and a pile of whipped cream with chocolate and caramel drizzles,  over the pie, oh yum! Coffee and sweet tea very good.  Our waitress was very attentive which made for a pleasant dining experience. All in all, a great meal. We will be back again",

We went today after church so Sunday around 12:30 for you heathens.  Restaurant is clean, well decorated and there was a decent crowd.  Sweetie and I sat down and saw that it seems like they've raised their prices.  $22 for a Prime Rib Sandwich & Fries is a bit high imo.  I decided on the grouper sandwich ($22) with fries and Sweetie ordered the catch of the day which was Swordfish tacos ($16).  We drank water as to stop the bleeding.    Food arrived and it was AMAZING as always.  The grouper seemed fresh, and the whole dish was memorable.  Fries were hand cut and right out of the fryer served perfectly.  Sweetie enjoyed her tacos along with fresh guacamole and salsa.  The service was also amazing, they do a great job of training the waiters and waitresses to be attentive and not bothersome.  Wonderful!  All said, the meal and experience were great!  I'll keep going.  Although the prices are high all in for 2 lunch entrees and 2 waters it was like $42 which, for lunch is a bit much.  But as always, the food and service were excellent so there's that.",

I've given them at least half a dozen shots but each time I leave feeling like I'm never returning. Today, I sat at the fire fit to enjoy the beautiful weather around 4:15 on a Saturday. The hostess said the bar would serve us and to seat ourselves. Waited a good 10 minutes before finally walking inside to the bar to order drinks. Melissa said she would bring them out and sorry she didn't see us. Ok.   Ordered appetizers when she brought the drinks. A server/runner brought them  15-30 mins later and joked about how my glass had a hole in it since it was empty. We asked him to tell Melissa that we needed another round and a bottle of Pellegrino. 20 minutes goes by, we finish our food without so much as a drop of water and nobody stopping by to check.   When I went inside to pay the bill, Melissa said the server didn't tell her about the drink order and offered to comp the appetizers plus a round on the house if we wanted. I was ready to leave after such a long wait so didn't take her up on the offer for free drinks, but wondering why with only 4 people at the bar and 2 bartenders shooting the shit with the customers that someone couldn't have stuck their head out the door to see if we needed anything. Completely subpar, IMO.   Sitting on the patio at The Porter's House now. Excellent service so far, can't beat the atmosphere, free valet parking, and from past experience the food is top notch. Somebody pls smack me if I try to step foot into 131 Main again!",

    "text": "I didn't know what to expect but was kind of let down overall by this dining experience. I looked at a lunch menu online before coming in just before 2pm on Sunday, but learned that they don't serve lunch on Sunday- just dinner all day. I guess that's not that big of a deal, but I really wasn't in the mood for dinner, so my husband and I shared some appetizers and the soup of the day (which I think they called a creole something or another...beans, andouille, etc).  Deviled eggs- when they set them down, they were a mess. The filling was just slopped on there, and all around, an off putting presentation. They did taste good though- not spectacular- but good enough that I was less irritated by the look of them.  Smoked salmon- this was my favorite thing. The fish had a great smokey flavor and was a larger than expected portion for an appetizer. It's served with toast points and an \"herb aioli\" (mayonnaise with stuff in it, but mostly just mayo) and I liked it well enough.  Grilled artichokes- total let down. I love artichokes and prepare them all the time at home, but these just weren't good. They were really tough and other than the grill flavor, didn't seem to be independently seasoned. They were served with a tub of mayonnaise that didn't seem much different than the tub of mayo served with the salmon they called \"aioli\" but they were slightly different colors, only the salmon's mayonnaise had a touch more flavor.  Soup- tasty enough, but not creole, and not spicy as the server said it would be. Thank the gods for Crystal hot sauce and the fact that it was on the table. It was the best part of the dish.  Back to presentation- all of the dishes just thrown onto whatever it was served on. And I don't necessarily need to be cruise line wowed by all plates set in front of me, but at this price point ($20 and up for entrees, $22 sandwich, $50 for appetizers and no booze lunch) a little effort is appreciated.  Service- service was fine. I am super confused by the uniforms though. Everyone was wearing a long sleeve black shirt that looked more athletic than fine dining. Couldn't tell if it was a UPF shirt and they were planning a deep sea fishing excursion, or a just rocking the base layer from under a ski jacket. I'm assuming it was supposed to be a warm weather friendly long sleeve option, but I felt so bad for them having to wear that. Not a flattering look on anyone and didn't match the decor.  The place looks so fancy and gives a fine dining vibe, and asks a price of an upscale restaurant, but lacks in many of the things that nicer dining establishments deliver. I guess I just love a good dining experience and appreciate all the little details that make a place great, and all of the little details at 131 Main just made it all very strange. I just didn't get it.",

It is seasoned from the grill and comes with a remoulade sauce. The herb roasted chicken is tender, flavorful and with the mashed potatoes it felt like home. My friend had the fresh tuna special with the Asian slaw and loved it. For dessert it was the banana cream pie and there wasn't a bite left. The service: Our server, Tara, had the perfect suggestions for everything we ate as well as for wine pairings. Please see her when you visit- she made our night fantastic! We were so well taken care of by her and the other staff members that we will be back soon. Thank you for an evening that left nothing for want- this is the 131 Main we know and love!",

First of all, the service was IMPECCABLE, which is the biggest reason for 5 stars, which I rarely give. The food was very good; my husband got a filet, which was cooked to perfection and had a smoky,grilled flavor. I had the Top Chop salad. OMG! So yummy! It is HUGE with ingredients like quinoa, Craisins, artichoke hearts, chicken and goat cheese. Party in my mouth! Then dessert... We shared a piece of peanut butter pie, which was seriously large enough for 3 people. Just WOW! We dropped $100, but it was worth it for our special occasion! The only negative is that they could include some bread before the meal- a pan of cornbread, perhaps? I will say that our food came out fairly quickly, so we wouldn't have had a lot of time to eat bread.  We went on Sunday night around 5:30 and there were plenty of tables with no reservation. We will be returning to 131 Main!",

    "text": "Glad I did not have to think about running into Al here (second reason for giving this place another look)!  I had eaten the Ribs before when they first opened and remember them begin tasty and better than most other places.  Since then I have eaten a lot of Ribs, I'm back here to eat them a YES they are Very Good!  The Gazpacho is chunkier than most versions, in my estimation it is highly Americanized, still Yummy Yum I would eat this on a boat or with a goat and it is a RED (not green) Gazpacho!  Not a hint of olive oil, nor fennel, nor vinegar (every culture has a different take on it (so I heard). Garnished with a Lime Infused (I guess) Sour Cream.  It gets 5 yelp stars!  The Fries are Impressive and make it on my \"Lonely Fries\" list because they are that good!  Almost as good as \"Brick Tops\"  Close to five yelp stars!  The Bar!  Bars are usually not where I want to eat, nor drink, though I will if no other seats are available and I LOVE Crowds!  Usually Bars, as \"furniture\" have little appeal unless they are really cool!  131 Main Blakeney has a Bar that reminds me of that  _____     _______, Jack Nicholson \"Bar\" scene in \"The Shinning\", so I think that is pretty cool, 5 yelp stars for the Bar!  Prime Rib ordered and prepared VERY RARE, completely perfect!  Three way tie with \"Epic Chop House\" and \"Brick Tops\"... 5 yelp stars!  Babyback Pork Ribs (maybe babyback ribs are always Pork, I'm guessing)... Lean and flavorful!  A VERY close Tie with \"Brick Tops\"!  5 yelp stars!  BBQ Sauce...This is a good one, better than most, probably in my top picks for a BBQ sauce of this kind.  Close to five stars!  The Cornbread is an appetizer served in a Cast Iron Skillet (see my photos).  This is a good Cornbread, soft non-grainy texture with Jalapenos, Butter on Top and Broiled until it is almost burned!  This is a preparation I have never seen before.  The flavor was good enough for 3.88 yelp stars which means I'm glad I checked it out though would not order it again!   I told my server that I would compare the Burger here to a \"Cow Fish\" Burger, ooops!  Cow Fish wins by almost two stars... 131 Main 3.2 Stars for the Burger!  P&G Slaw... Hated it... Not really and even after we found out it was a Mayonnaise Based Slaw I forgot to tell them to omit it from my order, so I got, I ate it and though I do not like Mayonnaise it was a good Slaw for a Mayonnaise based Slaw!  The place looks really great (beats \"Brick Tops\" for Looks) they have a cool patio and the Service beats almost everyone!  All staff is very personable and one of the Managers made a comment about my photo of the Very Rare Prime Rib making people jealous... Maybe if they like VERY Rare Beef!

With 3 kids, its hard for the wife and I to get out, so when we do, we want something special. We have found our new spot. The quality of the food for the price was excellent.

We really like the food and have gone at least once a month, taking many visitors here over the past year and a half.  It's funny, because I used Yelp to look up the phone number and thought \"Why only 4 stars?\".  I thought it was a fluke when we tried to make reservations on Saturday and got turned away.  So I called today to make reservations for my birthday two weeks out, and they told me that they do not take reservations for parties of more than 4! \"Okay, so what is the process?\" I asked, after hearing they no longer have a call ahead list either.  Basically they told me I would have to come 1.5hrs prior to when I HOPE to be seated. So get a group of my friends to sit and wait around, hoping we will be seated in 1.5hrs (or more?!?!) and then risk our plans afterward?  No, thank you! Even Michelin Star restaurants are more accommodating.  I have no idea what they think they're running there, though I'm astounded by the nerve!  I guess we will have to take this restaurant off of our list due to the lack of respect for their patrons.",

    "text": "At a girlfriend's suggestion of \"the kids have a sitter, let's go eat!\", I met her for lunch on a Saturday at 131 Main in Blakeney.   After a call to her of \"where in the hell is this place?\", I found the standalone building towards the back corner of the shopping center.  It's a beautiful building with lots of parking, with both indoor and outdoor seating.    We arrived around 11:30 and were seated immediately and quickly greeted by our waiter.  He had suggestions and was able to answer our questions about dishes easily.  It's nice to have wait-staff who can tell you what their recommendation for best dishes are instead of \"well, I like everything...\".  And if you like ambiance (ambiance = darkness), this is the place for you!  We sat at a comfy booth and had plenty of room for food and drinks without shuffling items around throughout the meal.    My lunch date ordered Gazpacho ($5) as an appetizer and it looked delicious.  A large bowl of tomato-ey goodness with a drizzle of sour cream (?) through it.    For our entrees, she ordered the Awesome Roast Beef Sandwich ($16), which is served with au jus and shoestring fries.  She said the sandwich really was awesome.  I ordered the Corned Beef Sandwich ($13) with fries.  The waiter volunteered to me that the \"zesty slaw\" served on the corned beef sandwich was indeed zesty, and when I made a face he offered to have that put on the side.  It was zesty, although not overpowering, but I am glad that I got it on the side so it didn't sog my sandwich down. My sandwich was absolutely delicious!  The corned beef was not stringy or tough at all, and the sauce, cheese and slaw (which I added small amount of to the actual sandwich) complimented it so well.  Best corned beef sandwich I have had in ages and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The fries were good as well.  For dessert we split a piece of Banana Creme Pie ($7), which was HUGE and served with banana slices and drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce (I think?).  I had not had banana creme pie in ages, and it was yummy.  Our server said that the desserts are made on-site and the pie definitely tasted fresh.    It was a little more expensive than I typically pay for a lunch with a girlfriend, but the ingredients did indeed taste fresh, the wait staff was attentive and informative without being overbearing and everything that I had was delicious.  This is a great place for a special treat.",

The seafood was fresh and the crab cakes had huge lumps of crab meat in them. The loaded mashed potatoes are AMAZING and will bring me back again.  My daughter had a hotdog off of the kids menu (you have to ask the server what is on the kids menu since it is not published). The hot dog was huge and on a onion bun. She loved her entire meal.",

On my last visit, I tried the Ahi Tuna Salad (with mixed greens, fresh mango, avocado, & ginger vinaigrette) for $15.   This is a great place for date night or for meeting friends on the patio for appetizers and drinks!",

The steak was rare, the prime rib sandwich was cold and the shrimp and grits were room temperature. The manager came to the table to bring back the steak and did not even acknowledge the issues we reported to our waitress.  There are too many restaurants in the area to waste my money on bad food. I am so disappointed.",

I enjoy the ambience of 131 main as well. It is a great atmosphere for dinner. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door. I was surprised that was not a wait to be seated. I told the ladies that my husband was parking the car and they assured me that they would bring him to the table - and they did. Great customer service from the start.   During this visit our waiter was pleasant knowledgeable about the daily specials. He was attentive and often checked for refills and to ensure that we were pleased.   We will definitely return as we have not been disappointed since coming to the Ballantyne location.",

That seemed to be a good idea because even though it was a weekday people were waiting.   I did put on the reservation I was celebrating my birthday and at least 4 of the employees told me Happy Birthday throughout the night including a manager who made it her point to come to my table and tell me. They also put a candle in my dessert. My waiter ( I wish I remembered his name) was great and very personable. We shared a couple of laughs.   Now let's get to the food. I had a pineapple-esque drink as well as my bf had a blueberry mule which were both delicious. We got the cast iron cornbread for an appetizer. Definitely would recommend it was so soft and had a nice crispness on the crust of it from the skillet oh and it comes with honey.   Me and my bf got the same thing for our meal. Filter mignon, mashed potatoes, and we added greens and the curried corn on the side.   The steak was cooked great. I loved the mashed potatoes you could tell they were from scratch. The curried corn (please order this side) the sweet and then spice from the curry is such a delicious combination. Green beans had a nice snap to them as well.   Brownie a la mode for dessert. Delicious! The vanilla ice cream tasted like it was freshly churned that day.   Everything was just fresh and even the small details of like writing on my to-go box the date and what was in it caught my attention. Or that the bags they used for the to-go boxes were made from recyclable paper. I noticed the small things.   Definitely recommended especially for any type of celebration. Can't wait to go back one day.",

This restaurant was pretty packed on a Tuesday evening, and there was a 45 minute to 1 hour and 20 minute wait which was a good sign upon arrival.  Luckily, there was some space at the bar to squeeze in and grab a wonderful meal with a colleague.  The bartenders and food runners were on point.  I would definitely come back here to try other things on the menu.  Check them out!",

I believe we were seated a few minutes before that so that was great because it's a school night and I had my 13 year old with us. Let me just say that our server ANGIE was spectdamntacular!!!!!! She knew the entire menu word for word, said all of the specials of the day including drinks without reading....off the top of her head. We had to give her some kudos for that. She gave us her opinion of what was great and delicious to order since we haven't been here in years and my brother was a virgin to the place. All of her suggestions were on point. And no one had to get a to go box!!! Not even my middle daughter(22) whose eyes are normally bigger than her stomach. Everyone's plate was scraped clean. Good job 131 and Angie!!",

They were good, but nothing special. I had the prime rib sandwich which was great. The meat just melted in my mouth! My companion had the veggi burger. I tried a bite and it was very good; almost meat like. She ate the entire sandwich and enjoyed it. Unfortunately, she had severe stomach issues for the next two days. We cannot positively ID the vegi burger, but based on what we ate and shared that weekend, we also can't rule it out.   I'm sure we'll be back to explore more of the menu, from the dining room.",

They were kind enough to seat the first two members of our party to arrive without the other two, which is seemingly becoming an increasingly rare occurrence.  To start, we started with the smoked salmon--I'd say it's a good starter for four people, although hungrier parties might want to order to starters to begin their meal. The dish came highly recommended and, while it's not the most memorable thing in the world, it was a good choice nonetheless.  I ordered the Big Island Ribeye as my main. Nothing memorable when it comes to the fries, but the ribeye actually pretty good. I found it to be an enjoyable, well-marbled cut (which is to be expected, considering it's a ribeye), but what really set this dish apart was pineapple soy sauce--wow! I'm not a fan of pineapples under most circumstances, and the taste was present across the entire steak, but I was blown away by how well it accentuated the juicy marbling. It's this glaze that sets this dish apart from your usual non-steakhouse steaks.  As for the service, I found the waiter to be both knowledgeable, open to questions, and willing to give honest opinions, which always makes for a pleasant experience.",

Moving into the grilled artichokes.  Probably my favorite appetizer they offer.  A little messy but we were provided hot moist towels for our pre-dinner clean up.  I was a tad disappointed in the fact that they ran out of Ribeye but went with my other choice of Shrimp & Grits which was totally satisfying.  A bit of a twist on the traditional being served with a gently spicy creamy corn salsa.  The hubby went with the always delicious rack of ribs.  We were wavering over whether or not to push on with a dessert and ended up choosing to share the Key Lime pie.  Usually one of my man's favorite desserts.  Unfortunately this one left us a bit empty.  The fresh whipped cream was over whipped and the cinnamon graham cracker crust was just too cinnamony for us.  We didn't even finish.  Go for the appetizers and main courses but do yourself a favor and skip dessert.",

We were greeted and taken to a quiet booth where we could chat. I'm currently doing the Whole 30 program so I'm pretty limited on what I can eat. The only really compliant item on the menu is the salmon with asparagus. I explained to the waiter about my current dietary limitations and he was very obliging. I'm honestly thankful for whole 30 because if I wasn't doing it, I wouldn't have ordered the salmon because I almost never do when I'm out. Goodness gracious, I swear to god it was the most perfect piece of salmon I have ever eaten. It was lightly seasoned and perfectly grilled. I'm still dreaming of it. I'm excited to go back after whole 30 and try some other items but honestly if I go back, I'll probably be getting the salmon because it's that good! Highly recommend!   I also really find it fascinating that all their food is brought in fresh daily. They literally don't even have freezers in the restaurant. I love that.",

And when it did finally come at an edible temperature the meat itself was not pleasantly edible bc it was so tough and dry! I think they need to up their game in the quality of meat they're buying! Thankfully, the staff was excellent.....hence 3 as opposed to 1.",

    "text": "Food: we had the cornbread for an appetizer. They serve it with honey that you can drizzle over the bread and it is delicious. Prepared in a cast iron which puts a good crust on it. Fish tacos were the entree served with guacamole and chips. The tacos were delicious. Slightly spicy.   Service: very polite, but they forgot our cornbread. We had t remind them and it didn't make it out until after our entrees were served.  Atmosphere: very comfortable. Casual yet professional. Ideal for business lunch or a dinner out.  Miscellaneous: This place only uses its freezers for their ice cream so you're eating fresh and it's priced right. I'd definitely go back. I just hope the servers bring their A game next time.",

The crab cake salad a favorite of mines, and I always end up having the same waitress when I come. We have a catch-up time and still give each other a warming greeting. Half off wine is must have!! It's dark inside but dead heart-centered I'm Ballantyne. I would say this a family location and nice out for couples/parents.   I heard the lamb chop meal is delicious, so I'm going to check that out next time. My two-year-old daughter had a kids meal, but she only seems to like fries at this point in life. Lol!",

We arrived on a Wednesday night at 6:55, without reservations, but luckily got one of the last tables in the dining room. Needless to say by 7:30 the entire restaurant was full and remained that way until we left, and I know why...the food is delicious!  I was told to try the grilled artichoke appetizer, OMG, amazing. The grilled flavor was too die for and the mayo dipping sauce is an added bonus. After the appetizer, we decided to share two entrees so we ordered the filet and crab cake special and the cedar planked salmon. The filet, cooked medium, was amazing! One of the best filets I have had in a long time. The crab cake was good, but I have another restaurant favorite so it didn't meet that one, but still good. The salmon was cooked to perfection, however, I did find one bone... I know it happens so I didn't worry and enjoyed it! The sides, mashed potatoes & broccoli all cooked perfectly. As for the dessert, we were full but the waitress expressed the fact it was my birthday and we had to enjoy something so we went with the warm brownie with ice cream. What can I say, another to die for item on the menu, a warm brownie, topped with peanuts, caramel, hot fudge and ice cream....a True dessert treat!  I cannot wait to get back, because the baby back ribs looked and smelled delicious, my next visit I will order!",

I've dined at this location a few times in the past and was informed by a number of servers that several of the menu options were gluten free or could be prepared gluten free. During my most recent visit, when I asked the server which gluten free options were available, she informed me (quite snidely I may add) that they \"were not doctors and couldn't say which options were gluten free because people might still have a reaction.\" Quite concerning as I'd been ensured that items such as the veggie burger were prepared gluten free in the past. Anyway, long story short, we ended up paying for our drinks and heading elsewhere. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location.",

So satisfied with our service. I would say ask for Chris, but the service is consistently high with any of their well trained wait staff. We were off to a good start when hot towels came out after the appetizer. I personally enjoy being able to customize a dish, and it come out as expected. For example, I asked that the steak in the Thai Steak salad be replaced with Ahi Tuna, and that a side of kale be mixed in. Our order was perfect, as expected after years of patronage. Thank you for another perfect evening 131 Main.",

The Hostess staff was unfriendly and it took 10 min of my husband standing there before anyone acknowledged him. He made a reservation for 7:30pm and we arrived a little early so we expected to wait but not to be ignored before being greeted. The job of a hostess is to set the stage and be inviting; which they were not. The young lady who sat us seemed unhappy and should not have been working due to her poor attitude. Our waitress was Kristen and she was very nice. Our drinks from the bar were excellent. You could taste the alcohol and it was not watered down. We had the blueberry mule and peachy daly. Food was great. You could tell everything was fresh. Got the soup of the day and crab cakes. I ordered the scallops originally but they ran out so crab cakes were the second choice and it did not disappoint. Desert was good as well we had the brownie and it was good. It did come with nuts which I liked and it was like warm which didn't melt the ice cream too much which I loved. This is a nice place and I will be back especially for the drinks and food.  I am giving them a 4 bc of the horrible hostess service.",

    "text": "I believe my lunch at 131 Main can be summed up with one dish...the \"Awesome Roast Beef\" sandwich.   Atmosphere - Upscale, modern, brown, business meeting appropriate vibe, noisy, dimly lit, watch out for that first step into the dining area (accident waiting to happen)   Service - Attentive, informative, black linens for black pants...I like!     Food - After some prompting, I opted for the menu titled \"Awesome Roast Beef\" sandwich, which comes with a side of shoestring fries.  Forgoing the fries as my side (see my JJ's Red Hots review) I opted for an order of the grilled asparagus instead.    My entree, the Awesome Roast Beef Sandwich, arrived with a minimal wait.  It was presented with an au jus and my substitution of grill asparagus.    Um, this sandwich was truly awesome.  The fancy cut, baguette style, bread was decent and held the sandwich together during repeated dunks into the salty au jus.  To be honest, I thought sandwich tasted fine without the au jus.  Maybe this was due to the smear of mayonnaise, which I normally avoid but did not mind in this instance.  In the sandwich was red, lean, juicy, and very tender roast beef.  While at $16 this was a pricy lunch, it was the best French Dip style sandwich that I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  The side of grilled asparagus was good and contained a nice smoky flavor validating the authenticity of its grilled marks.  Overall - While I cannot see (i.e. afford) going here every week, 131 Main is a nice place to take coworkers or that special someone for your scheduled fancy meal.    Enjoy!",

I have enjoyed meals there many times, but less and less over the last 2 years- because the service has gone down and the quality of the food--- while prices have skyrocketed.  An example is our dinner last night.  My son and I had ordered the prime rib sandwich with au jus and horse radish sauce.  This sandwich used to be a 10+ for flavor and value 2 years or so ago.  Now- I could have gotten a much better SANDWICH AT SUBWAY at a 4th of the price !!!!   What used to be sliced/shaved prime rib, the meat? was chopped up in to little pieces and balls and would fall out of the sandwich when I attempted to dip the sandwich in either of the sauces ???  Totally contrary to what the sandwich implies with dipping sauces available.  The taste was so-so at best.  FLIES - flying around the table the entire meal???-  The table had 4-7 flies that kept flying around our heads, our food and the walls or glass dividers at our booth.  I saw several other tables fighting flies as well throughout meals.  When I mentioned this to the waiter _as we are watching flies around his head- , he said this is a problem they are aware of and had sprayed the restaurant the day before to eliminate the problem... obviously, this is not working...  SERVICE ??? After an appetizer, the waiter took away the dishes and the used silverware to \"refresh\" with clean silverware for the yet to be delivered entree' for our table.  Ten (10) minutes or so our entree' was delivered to the table without silverware.  After waiting 5 or so more minutes, I stopped another waiter to help get our silverware so we could enjoy our meal--  this other waiter was kind and responsive.    Encouraging all to always provide your perspective/feedback to restaurants that need to hear from you in an open and honest way !",

I really like the fact that they offer both Pepsi and Coke because it pleases everyone at the table.   We ordered the cornbread in a cast iron skillet with honey. It is wonderful! I don't even eat cornbread, but I will take down half of more of this cornbread because it is that good.   My husband ordered the wedge salad which, during this visit, he told me is the best salad he had ever had.   I ordered the corned beef and swiss sandwich with hand cut fries, and he ordered the chicken sandwich. Now, I'm not a corned beef expert, so I wasn't aware that the cooking time was medium rare. The meat had a really good taste to it, it's just cold meat is not my thing. I asked Cassie if she could just throw it in the microwave, really no big deal at all. But she was very apologetic, like they did something, which they did not, I'm just particular (picky *gasp*). After about 5 minutes the manager came over and apologized as well, really it was not a big deal, just not my thing. When I did get my new hot sandwich out, they also gave me brand new fries. It was excellent! Two thumbs, and eight fingers up, it was great.   Cassie was very attentive, as well as the rest of the wait staff. I may drink water like a camel, so I run out really often. I never ran out of water.  At the end of our meal the check came, and my meal was comped. Blew my mind. What turned into something that I felt I should have actually read the menu for, was a great gesture on their part. A little thing like that and we will be patrons over and over again.   I really applaud this establishment, and we will be back for many more brithdays to come.",

It's pricey so bring your wallet. I spent just under $80 for myself with the meal and two drinks. The ambiance is fun and lively, but the acoustics do make it difficult to hear other people speaking.

    "text": "Ok so my shrimp and grits really deserve 5 stars, they were that delicious. As a Louisiana native, I know my shrimp and grits and 131 Main's execution of this dish was fantastic. The restaurant is really more of a 3-4 star place though. The menu is boring. There's just no other way around it. If I hadn't ordered the shrimp and grits, there wasn't anything else I wanted on the menu. Now that's sad because I love food! Porkchps, ribeye, meatloaf? I make perfect versions of that at home. This menu is so Houston's in 1995...was there even a Houston's in Charlotte? Frankly, the atmosphere is so Houston's circa 1995 as well. Heavy, dark dining too with an aloof staff and loud kitchen...no thanks. Judging by the depth and layers of flavor in my dish, the chef here is more than capable of putting out some wow dishes. The menu is desperately in need of some creativity and revamping. Especially the sides. The side menu is sad. So sad. The apps too. We got the double dip and again it was great for what it was...yummy guacamole and pimento cheese with tortilla chips. BUT, this is so boring. Delicious but boring. Guac and tortilla chips, really? Did I mention that their soup of the day was loaded potato soup? I'm surprised loaded potato skins weren't on the boring, outdated app menu. 1995 called, they want their menu back.",

Last night I called ahead asking if there would be availability for a party of 6 and was told there was \"NO WAIT\" and to \"come on in\".  We immediately went there(5 minutes later) and  as soon as the hostess saw we had children we were told there would be a 45 minute wait, with empty tables everywhere. The same thing happened to my sister multiple times in the last few years.  I live in CT and have NEVER been discouraged from bringing my well behaved children ANYWHERE, including the TOP restaurants in Manhattan any night of the week, much less a SUNDAY as it was last night.  Shame on 131 for not welcoming everyone. They will never get my business and be warned if you have children--DO NOT GO THERE!",

Lots of space for waiting, especially cool was the outdoor fireplace on the patio where you could bring a drink and wait for your table. Long wait (over an hour) on a Saturday night.  This is definitely a date restaurant at night - dark, romantic, cozy booths and strong drinks. Menu is New American, lots of proteins with veggie sides. We started with a queso/guac combo dip - it was unusual in that the queso was more of a pimento dip with shredded cheese but very tasty. Our entree's were both very good, double-stuffed porkchop and the crab cake salad. Generous portions, perfectly cooked, fresh ingredients.  Service was very good, helpful and playful waiter who paced the meal well and understood we didn't want to be rushed.   A good place that deserves repeat business, especially in this age of chains!",

    "text": "Where to start?  First, the restaurant was not what I was expecting.  My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner.  I had heard about this place on the radio many times and was thinking it was somewhat upscale and would make for a romantic dinner.  We went on a Saturday night and did not make reservations.  We were expecting a wait and there was one, about an hour.  We really wanted to try the place, so we waited in the bar and had some drinks.  The bartenders were nice enough.  They took a little while to refill drinks, but they were busy and that is understood.  I thought it was odd that there were TV's in the bar area.  I felt they took away from the ambiance.  They were distracting and the only ones who seemed to be watching them were staff members as they walked by.  If I were management I would remove them or at least turn them off at dinner time.  Once we were finally seated we ordered the cornbread skillet.  While the top was very yummy, the bottom was covered in flour, chunks of flour.  It was gross, but we don't like sending things back, so we scraped the bottom and ate it.  Our waitress did the right thing and saw the mess at the bottom of our pan and comped the appetizer.  This is why they got 3 stars.  Between the 2 of us we ordered a soup, salad, steak and fish tacos.  They were all delicious.  The server was very sweet.  I don't know if I would go back though.  It is very pricy for a casual night out ($15 hamburgers) and I don't think has the right atmosphere for a nice romantic dinner.  They're kind of somewhere in between the two.",

Kudos first: friendly waitstaff, and my martini was way above average. After that, it all was substandard. I ordered the pork chop which the waiter recommended. It was a surprise, but not a good surprise. It was as the chef didn't know what to do with it. It was a gorgeous chop--2 inch thick, but no seasoning, or really, any flavor to it. They asked how I wanted it done (med well)  and proceed to cook it medium rare anyway (which is how they do it if you don't have a preference.) Besides being a thick piece of pork, there wasn't anything else redeeming about it.  The wines by the glass were underwhelming. The first glass of pinot noir they served tasted as if it had been corked overnight--flat. The second one was not notable. There are so many good pinots out there--why serve the mediocre? The gals in my spin class raved about Tuesday night 1/2 priced wine and appetizers.  Perhaps that is 131 Main's forte and we just missed out, as I thought the meal was not worth returning for and a tad overpriced (and we are used to paying more for nice meals where we came from.)",

My husband said his dish was good but wish the fish wasn't so soaked in butter (may not be a bad thing). Service was excellent, my half/half ice-tea filled glass was never empty.

    "text": "This place is great for special occasions or on dates. Also, this restaurant is good for picky eater. I took my parents to eat there. We truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food there. Nothing can go wrong with its food. If you go you have to get the cast iron cornbread. Its cornbread is to die for and it comes with honey in the jar that you can put it on your cornbread. 131 makes the perfect cornbread. My dad had the fish taco ,and it comes with torilla chips and guacamole and salsa. The fish taco comes with two fish tacos and if you want the dinner portion is three fish tacos. The lunch portion is huge! Mom had the fish sandwich and it is not the ordinary fish sandwich you get at the regular chain restaurants. Its fish sandwich is grilled and the fish is thick like the steak. The only suggestion I will give is don't get the veggie burger because it wasn't that great. The veggie burger is made with red bean so it doesn't taste great. Also, 131 makes the best slaw and it is very unique than the other slaw you get from other restaurants. I also ordered two drinks for my parents. I ordered the 131 Mainiac and Mr. Tea. Both drinks were excellent. Service was great! We were too full to get dessert. Next time I will get the banana cream pie. If you go to dinner, the lightning is dark. You can call it romantic or you don't really want to see what your dates look like. I wish I can give ten stars to this restaurant. The bill wasn't bad. It came less than 100 dollars. In Vegas, this place would cost more.",

The atmosphere is upscale American, can be a bit loud in the dining room, the bar is lively and the outdoor area with the fire pit makes for a great place to enjoy a pleasant evening. Now the bad and I mean bad, the bar service. I have never experienced this kind of consistently bad service in a bar. In general the staff is uncoordinated, more interested in talking with each other and just non-attentive to the clientele. On more that one occasion i have had to hunt down a bartender or server multiple times on the same visit. The staff seems young and generally uninterested, unprofessional and unprepared. I have spoken at length with the general manager and was very specific about what was happening in the bar but I have seen no change in behavior. This is a real shame because, despite all the good things about the place if the bar situation does not improve I may not go back.",

We were tired of the same old stuff and gave it a try about a month ago and have been back twice since. Their menu is nothing frilly, just good solid choices ranging from lamb chops to a plentiful amount of seafood options.   They have a double dip appetizer with housemade guacamole, salsa and a \"cold queso\" that looks like pimento cheese but tastes like a well seasoned queso. Their salads are fresh and have tasty dressings, the Caesar is scrumptious.   We have tried multiple entrees from the lamb chops, Maryland style crab cakes and more. None of them have disappointed. My husband has settled on the fish tacos as his go to.   Tonight I had the special which was fresh swordfish overnighted from California (our waiter even told me the name of the boat it was caught on). It was covered in lump crab meat and lemon butter sauce. It was one of the best pieces of swordfish I have ever had and cooked to absolute perfection.   On Tuesdays their wine is half price which is always a win in my book. Although not the cheapest it is worth the price for a great meal and attentive service.",

It was disgusting. When we told the waitress, she was adamant that it was normal. The manager then came out and apologized, but they didn't take it off of the bill. Seriously? That's not how you get me to come back.  My roast beef sandwich was very average--not hot, bread not crispy, just average. I could make a similar sandwich at my house for half the price.   This place has really gone down in my books. I probably won't be back. Oh well.",

    "text": "Ok. 4 stars for a solid meal. The menu has a little bit of everything, it's a nice setting, the service is top-notch, the beer selection is decent, the desserts are slammin', and that cornbread app is freaking awesome. I enjoyed the grouper and several New Belgium Rangers, but I don't want to spend my time on the food. It's great, so know that. You'll be happy with most everything under this roof. However, I want to spend my time on HOW DARK IT IS INSIDE. I needed my friends to wear bells so we could locate where their table was.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not mad at all. I rather enjoyed the setting. I found it so comically dark, though, at our table that I actually used my phone as an added light source for my friend to read the menu, the bill, and even the cards in my wallet. My eyes didn't want to adjust hardly at all throughout the meal. I think all of us commented on how low the lighting was. It was so cozy that I wanted to ask for a few more napkins, kick back at a booth, and take a nap. It really closes you in, too. You feel like you're in your own dining room with nothing but candle light. A nice touch, but you have to be ready for it. With some of the bar staff opening the door to the setting sun, you may feel like a hibernating mammal being rudely awakened. Sunlight, kindly stay out of the dining room.   Immensely enjoyed my first visit with 131 and only wish that I had done so sooner.",

We felt it was a little overpriced since there are other restaurants in the area with food we like more but similar items to what we ordered for about half the price. I will give 131 Main a thumbs up for having food that isn't run of the mill though. The coleslaw, for example, is made with ginger & peanut butter as the base. I didn't love the first bite, but it was so fresh & different that it kind of grew on me. I had a full rack of ribs with the slaw, a salad, and asparagus. The asparagus was the best thing on the plate. We enjoyed the cast iron corn bread appetizer. For a rare evening without our small children at a place close by the house in case our sitter needed us, this was a good choice. The service was fantastic & for the occasion, the atmosphere was lovely. They even treated us to dessert for our anniversary. We would return.",

    "text": "Don't got to this restaurant if you have a party bigger than 4. So to start reservations were made for seven and we were NOT told at the time we would have to sit at separate tables. This was for a birthday, who would be ok with that?   So we get there and we sit down confused at how they expect us to enjoy our full party of people when some will have to sit elsewhere. You may ask why not just move some tables together? The tables are stuck to the floor.   So we make it work and the birthday girl and her husband end up having to sit at separate tables. So while we wait for the food we have the idea well just come sit at the table with us and we can talk and socialize while we wait but since the table is not made for this many to eat we will use the other table to eat dinner. Well they just cleared the other table and sat people down there to eat without asking us if we were still going to use that table.   Like really? They basically handed her, her gifts that was sitting there on our other table as they just sit someone down. This was totally unacceptable. So we had to cram all of our plates. Ribs, steaks, shrimp and grits, etc. all on a little 4 side square table. We felt like grandmas house at thanksgiving.   The food was good yes it was but I was overtaken by the service that was received. I could barely enjoy my food as we all had to turn our plates ever which way to fit them on the table.   The thing that topped the cake was we had a new waitress. I know that we all start somewhere new but her excuse for everything she did not know, which was a lot I may add was \"I just started 2 days ago\". To me that means one thing you should have been trained better or longer before they let you by yourself. Don't use an excuse. Just plainly say \"Let me find that out.\" Just hearing that all night made me want to just go ask myself.   I am sorry if this was long but this was my first and probably last time coming to this location. I was just sideswiped by the service as a whole. The people were nice, food was good but important birthday experience ruined.",

The ambiance was awesome, the music was nice and it felt so warm and cozy in there. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because somehow, someone dropped the ball and didn't acknowledge it was our anniversary. My husband put it on the reservation and no one from the host to the server to management said anything. I was pretty upset but didn't make a big deal and moved on with my night.

They will take reservations for up to four people but six is out of the question. This is a completely backwards policy. It makes more sense to take larger reservations and not small ones so you can anticipate the crowd. She told me I could just show up maybe at 8 (we wanted a 7pm reservation) and see what happens. Really great experience guys...one star for customer service and another one for the good food (albeit the pricing on the 'awesome roast beef sandwich' increased by 5 dollars when they changed the name to 'prime rib sandwich' without doing anything to the recipe)",

    "text": "Tonight we ordered two ahi tuna salads to go--$45 after tipping the girl who was supposed to check the contents. The soy sauce containers weren't closed and had emptied into the lettuce, the mango wasn't ripe (very hard and added no flavor), and on one of the salads, the tuna was totally inedible (total gristle). We tried to call the restaurant, but could never reach a manager. We will never do take out again, which is sad, because this is one of our family favorites.   Update: Upon receipt of my email, the manager promptly contacted me (2-3 times) and was insistent (kindly) that he make things right. He did not want that experience to color our long-standing positive view of 131 Main. He made a generous offer to make us whole and gave me his personal cell, should there be any problems in the future. He is everything a manager should be. I really appreciated his kindness and thoughtfulness in handling the mess up.",

Skillet cornbread not bad, has cheese and some corn inside. Fish tacos were swordfish, pretty good. Tortilla was toasted but a bit chewy. Queso dip was great, like pimento dip nice and has a kick. Double cut pork chop so huge and tasty. Loaded baked potatoe was great! They have Guinness !!! Dirty titi with blue cheese stuffed olives YUM made it my desert! WILL come back!!",

The black skillet cornbread is another great choice. It is served warm with butter and a honey bear.   The only thing I can't recommend is the ribeye. I have tried it several times and I am always disappointed.  It is a thin cut and not great quality. 131 is a great restaurant, but it is no steakhouse. If you are craving beef, go with the prime rib. You will not be disappointed.   All the seafood dishes are outstanding. The grilled fish is always fresh and cooked to perfection. My all time favorite is the shrimp and grits.  There is no better shrimp and grits on the planet!!!!  For dessert, the banana pie is the bomb. No matter how full you are....make room for this pie.",

Even if it was the hostesses fault, and she didn't assign a server to me, every single server ignored me sitting there looking around like \"Hello??\" And even when I did get a server, some 20 minutes after I had sat down, she was terrible.

    "text": "Have visited both the Blakeney and Huntersville locations, and they are comparable. The biggest difference in the sound level, which is more muted in Huntersville. The restaurant designer subscribes to the theory that more ambient noise creates a sense of excitement, but I think they confuse \"excitement\" with \"anxiety\" and \"exhaustion\", as a simple conversation can become a struggle.  As for the food, yeah, it's pretty good. The roast beef sandwich has been enjoyed on more than one occasion. The service has been all over the map, but never so bad that we vowed never to return.  Wine list is pretty good, and the bars in both locations are hopping. Count on spending some time there, even if you have a reservation, and don't even bother trying to go on a peak time without a reservation.   [Tip: Smartphone users, download Open Table and use it in a situation like this. You can browse local restaurants to find one with capacity for you without calling each of them and being placed on hold until the hostess can find the time to take the call.]",

We experienced a decline in the level of service over the last couple of years, however we gave it another try tonight and it was by far the best experience we have had in any restaurant here in Charlotte! Everything was spot on from the time we entered and were greeted, to service, quality of food, and ambiance. Ben was our server. He was very knowledgable and helped us in selecting the perfect bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary . Nick the service manager was also very friendly and attentive and ensured we had the perfect experience. Timing of food delivery was perfection. Never rushed nor felt like we were waiting for a long period of time. We started with the cornbread appetizer accompanied with honey.  Not an item for calorie counters, but totally worth every pound gained! My husband had the wedge salad. He thoroughly enjoyed! I ordered the Main side salad. Perfectly dressed with an herb vinaigrette and topped with bacon and cornbread crumbles. For entrees my husband ordered the filet. Seriously the best piece of meat I have ever tasted!! Super tender and melt in your mouth delicious flavors! I ordered the trout and grits. No one does trout or grits like 131 Main! Delicious!! As full as we were we couldn't pass up dessert. We went for the only dessert we had yet to try here...the brownie a la mode. No words! Do yourself a favor and order! There is nothing ordinary about this brownie!  We have eaten at many restaurants throughout Charlotte including some of the best restaurants uptown. Still 131 Main remains our favorite. Thanks 131Main for an epic dinner experience! We can't wait to come back!",
