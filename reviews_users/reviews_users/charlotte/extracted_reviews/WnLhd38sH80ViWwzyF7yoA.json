We had the sushi burrito and Bangkok curry noodles, both of which were delicious. The prices were reasonable but be aware that the portions aren't huge as they are at many Thai restaurants. The portions were appropriate and filling but not two full meals like many places. We will be back to try more, especially lunch specials!",

The decorations are nice and has a romantic feel.   We ordered lettuce wrap and chicken skewers as appetizer. The lettuce wrap was plain and could've been better. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. Was not worth $8 though. The chicken skewers only came in 2s and was $6, and although the sauces were good, the chicken tasted like rubber.   For entrees, we had Bangkok Curry Noodle and Lao Sausages with sticky rice. BCN, which I am very familiar with and I was surprised this place served it, was not as great as I hoped it was. There was way too much coconut in the soup, I didn't like the carrots, and the portions were uneven, my friend had less soup than I did. The noodles were cut too small. As for the Loa sausages, I don't want to be rude, but it looks like store bought sausages that you can get at the asian store. Even with the rice, the portion is so small, how can they charge $12? After-all, thai and korean food are always more high-priced.",

It wasn't crowded, and the service started out a little slow. However, the service picked up and the food was quite good. I had the cashew shrimp which I liked. My wife had the lettuce wrap appetizer and loved it. My wife wants to go back, which for her for Asian food (which I love, her not as much) is a high complement!",

My daughter ordered the papaya salad and I ordered the green chicken curry. My daughter did not like the papaya salad and it was returned to the kitchen with no questions asked. She then ordered the shrimp pad Thai and loved it. The shrimp was cooked very well, they were tender and soft. The noodles were homemade. I think it was the best pad Thai I had ever tried. My curry, which I never had before was earthy and sweet and I loved the basil in it.",

There were few waitress running around but no one was taking care of the front table. The waitress handling the bar had to come down the long around way to come to me waiting at the door. Not so good to make your customers waiting. I was too tired that day to eat at the restaurant so I ordered by phone and the person on he other said my order would be ready in 20 mins. I reached the restaurant after 25 minutes and ended up waiting 25 more minutes till they cooked up my batch. No one offered me a table or chair to sit while I wait, so I invited myself over to an empty table and sat down.  The food finally came and I took home the red curry and fried rice. It wasn't so great - the fried rice seemed like brown rice but what I actually wanted was White rice. The Red curry was okay but not the best. After all my experience with Hibiscus didn't go well.  May be the dine in customers would hold a different opinion owing to the incredible star rating it has now!",

The wait staff knew right away who I was and handed me my order, no wait or delay! I wasn't able to really check out the restaurant as I was grabbing and going, but it looked like a nice place. There were some folks at the bar that were enjoying themselves.   The food was great! If you've ever gotten take out noodles you want everything separated... they did that!!! I opened the bag and was so grateful to see all the add ons in one container and the chicken curry in another container! Overall the curry was good, just what I was looking for, lots of pieces of chicken. I also got the spring rolls, not great. They used what seemed like bag lettuce in them instead of fresh cabbage or lettuce.   If i'm in the area again I will definitely stop in and enjoy my meal in the restaurant!",

We ordered a ton of things like the Bibimbap, the Sushiritto, Green Curry, Seafood Pancake, and for dessert the Purple Rice with Vanilla Ice Cream. I was not disappointed with a single dish. The service was amazing, the seasoning of the food was impeccable, the the theme and decor of the place is so cute.

    "text": "This is my response to the owner, no I'm not confused. My total for the teas was $6, $3 each for 2 like I mentioned. Then your waitress herself came back and explained to me that the $3 on top of that was tip for the bartender and that doesn't go to her. I'm absolutely certain.  Was excited in more options for Asian cuisine but,  larb was tasteless & stick to Thai house for pad Thai.  My grandmother & I requested hot sauce to save the dishes. They give you 3 that you have to scrape for so in her words, \"they are so stingy.\" It was good hot sauce though.  We order the hibiscus & green tea.  Hibiscus is pretty,  comes in clear coffee press type glass with pretty herbs in it. The green tea has to be assembled yourself & comes with a timer.  But in the end they charge me a bartenders fee on the tab,  no mention of this prior. I was confused,  the server told me it's a bartenders tip. So these are my problems with that:  1. They require you to pay gratuity,  it's not even an option. What place doesn't just tip out like normal? Whether it's for bartenders,  hostess, busboys etc... 2. The required rate seems to be 50% bc they charged me $3 extra for $6 worth of tea.  I'm not overly upset about a few bucks but if you spend $50, $40 on drinks,  then the automatic extra charge on that is $25, $20 etc.?? 3. Who told them it requires a bartender to pour tea? 4. You made me pay tip, but made us do half the work by steeping half of it ourselves with a oddly shaped teabag.   How does any of this add up?   I looked forward to this place for awhile & finally had the chance to stop in after a shopping trip closeby & a way for us to wait  on 5 o clock traffic to die down, but we left very unimpressed.  A star for nice service but that's it. Oh wait, the mango rice was good. We had 2 apps but they were just ok.",

I ordered the Bangkok curry noodle soup and the flavor was incredible! Peanuty, a little spice, and delicious. My only issue was the noodles were definitely overlooked and mushy. They were also egg noodles and I feel like with the dish rice rifles would have been nice.   My husband ordered the bibimbap and it was very good but basically your typical bibimbap.

The food is great. The chicken lettuce wraps is what got us the most!!! We shared it as an appetizer and it was literally us fighting for the last bite.",

For drinks, I got the House Concoction (not completely sure what was in it but it was delish) and my hubby got a beer. They also had a decent Sake list if that's your thing.   We started with some edamame as an app. Nice portion and perfectly salted. For our meal, we got the red curry chicken and the crunchy dragon roll. The red curry was perfectly flavored. The sushi roll was my absolute favorite though. I thought the fish tasted real fresh. Easily one of the best rolls I have had in a while!  So excited that Hibiscus is now a part of this Montford food and drink scene!",

    "text": "SOLID 4.5 My husband surprised me for our anniversary and brought me here. I love Thai food and being from Hawaii I miss good Asian food.  So many times when enjoyed on the mainland, many places add fillers like baby corn, bell peppers and peas.   We sat in a comfy booth which is a nice change from the bar-our usual real estate. They have bar seating as well. I asked a few questions of our server and discovered they serve local craft brews, able to customize orders and they have STICKY rice for $2, What?!!!???! So at this point I am freakin' excited.  I high fived my husband and began dancing in my seat. Of course, the awesome club music playing assisted with my elation.   We started off with a couple craft beers and fried dumplings. DELICIOUS! Our entrees consisted of green curry sans peas and bibimpap. And don't forget the sticky rice! Food arrived! Everything looked great. I was a bit confused when the waiter did not mix the bibimpap. He mentioned something about presentation, which I understand; however, I am accustomed to it being served in a hearty stone bowl with rice and all the fixings.  It comes to the table unmixed (hence presentation) the server asks how hot you want it and adds the appropriate red sauce, mixes it, pushes the concoction against the sides of the hot stone bowl.  Wait a little and the result is crispy goodness.  Here there is no rice and the type of bowl doesn't allow for crispy-ness.  Don't get me wrong, it was tasty just not what I thought I was getting.  Everything tasted great and I was able to exercise my mad chopstick skills.   We decided to take egg rolls to go.  Now we got yummy leftovers.  I love this place. I will adjust being on the mainland and all, but this place definitely deserves a visit for those \"traditional\" Asian food lovers.  You know, those who have not experienced the food in the Pacific Rim.",

Weary hostess approached me after I entered and told me that she couldn't seat me until she cleaned up some tables. After I was seated (about 10 minutes later), I saw several more empty tables had dirty plates, cups, etc. on them for at least 30 minutes. I had to wait about 15 minutes to order from the server who was helping both patrons inside and outside the restaurant and was spread too thin. Everyone I met seemed really nice, knowledgable, and customer-service oriented -- just seemed like they had too much work and not enough people on duty.  Food was good overall but inconsistent. Had some delicious soup (that was a surprisingly large portion) and the fresh spring rolls, and they were both things I would order again. The red curry dish was less successful and lacked flavor.   My server was very good -- just seemed like he had too many tables. But he did his best to take good care of me.   The restaurant decor is very tasteful and relaxing with a plum/purple color scheme.",

The last time I ate there with my boyfriend, we ordered sashimi and it was served completely frozen through. I understand the concept that sushi is frozen and then thawed, but this was barely thawed on the outside and crunchy and frozen in the middle. I decided to give it one more shot tonight and ordered a sushi roll with some soup through Uber eats, but when I ate a piece of the sushi (the fish in it was yellow tail), I almost gagged. The yellowtail was absolutely rancid and brown. It smelled and tasted terrible. The manager wasn't interested in me returning the sushi and insisted that my only recourse was to go through the delivery service (although it's not their fault), but that's a shame because he just lost two customers that have been fans of hibiscus for years. I'm a huge sushi fan and love frequenting Charlotte's numerous delicious sushi restaurants, but I will not be visiting this one again.",

Bc it's is such a great fusion Japanese-Thai-Lao flavor dishes with an upscale edge making the dining experience feel more upscale compared to other asian restaurants that offer decent Thai and Lao flavors. Their Laos sausage combo with sticky rice and the spicy dipping sauce is simply just ADDICTING TO EAT! And when it's cold out I always use post mates or eats24 app to get their soups to stay warm indoors, I can't spell the name so I'm not gonna attempt to sound stupid but the soup is made fresh and noodles a hand made hand cut fresh noodles, you don't get FRESH HAND CUT NOODLE soup hardly anywhere  around Charlotte .... actually at the top of my head I can't think of a place that does, even noodle house don't do that. Men let me tell you something. If u ever get into that argument with your lady and can't decide where to eat? We ALL HAVE BEEN THERE there are so many you tube videos of this never ending argument! hibiscus is the answer to your problem, this asian fusion restaurant gives her the choices of her indecisiveness  trust me, she will find something she likes sushi, Thai, soups, great appetizers, great curry , and if she don't? Which I'm sure she will, Grab a custom drink at their bar. I do, just to drown out the noise of the old lady.",

Our drinks from the bar arrived after our dinner came out! Not sure if the bartender was hunting down the ingredients or what. Not a huge deal, but would have been nice to sip on while waiting for dinner. I ordered the pad thai at a level 4--- usually overconfident in my spice tolerance. It was delicious with both chicken and shrimp and very spicy! Make your nose water spicy! I enjoyed it but would probably go for a 3 next time. Huge portion, I ended up taking over half home. Boyfriend got the bibimbap and it was good too! Great place if you are looking for a more upscale Asian dinner. Looks like they have some pretty good lunch specials too!",

We went for an early dinner and it wasn't crowded. The fried dumplings were okay, but the Thai and sushi just didn't taste fresh or have good flavor. Will not go back.",

Hmmm, no one is in your restaurant! The bartender understood but he is leaving to Cali. (Smart guy and great bartender) Sad that no one else cares to listen to the people that has first hand experience of the situation. Good luck!",

I am thrilled to find this new place with Korean bibimbap--authentic sides too!!  The beef bibimbap tasted amazing with traditional sides like pickled cucumbers and kimchee--yippee!! They tasted delicious. Bibimbap has beef, vegetables, rice, spicy sauce and an egg. The nice service even included more sides and special gochujang sauce! Worth the $16 because you have leftovers.  I also tried the steamed dumplings app and found them flavorful but there were only four in the order. So being a dumplings fan, I would have trouble sharing:). The ginger tea was the special tea forte kind I love! I'm going back again soon to try the sushi and the thai. (Parking is in the lot above near jason's deli.)",

I am only giving it 4 Stars because unfortunately they were not serving any of their sushi since the sushi chef is alway until 11/16/16.   I went in on a Thursday night w a friend, the place wasn't busy at all and we sat at the bar. I was glad to see that they were getting numerous pick up orders.    Started off w the Papaya Salad which was really good...their level 3 of spicy is True. Make sure to ask for extra peanuts if you are a fan since the serving was light on them.  The vegetable spring rolls were very fresh.   They have a full bar and some specialty cocktails which were excellent. Try the Leechy martini!  Last but not least, if you are a pho or soup fan, I would recommend the Vientiane Noodle Kow Piek Sen. The restaurant makes their own noodles and they are great!   can't wait to be back.   Thank you Yelpers!!",

Then you go ahead and order those same dishes thinking, \"Oh yea, this is going to be IT!\" Come to find out it wasn't all THAT great.   BUT! I'm going to give this place another chance (food wise). I ain't knocking it, but based on some of the dishes I had I'm not yet a fan. I hate to be that one going in a completely different direction than other Yelpers on the food, but maybe I just need to try other dishes (sushi perhaps)?  My curry was pretty good. The flavor was the usual coconuty green curry with chicken and veggies and fluffy rice. I didn't like the huge pieces of eggplant that were a bit tough to eat.   My Moscow Mule was good... kind of hard to mess that up.   I didn't get to try my dude's dish but he said it tasted burnt and he didn't really enjoy it. I had a lot of curry left so he polished off my dish in 2.5 seconds.   I did enjoy the appetizers. I wouldn't suggest ordering the dumplings. Although tasty, you only get 4 small pieces for the price. The lettuce wrap was really good. I'd order that again.   Service was good and I was afraid based on the popularity of the place, reservations were needed, but there were plenty of tables available on the Friday night we went.   I'll reserve my True waiting for this place after we go again.",

OK, we are already here, so we'll pay full price.  At 8:00 pm on a Friday night no wait and not even half full.  We were promptly seated and ordered some cocktails.  Waited 10 minutes, finally the server brought drinks, but not what we had ordered.  We waited another 5 minutes, no drinks, so decided to leave.  As we were walking out we met the server who had our drinks, but too late.    Again, the restaurant was not even 1/2 full on a Friday night prime time.  Doesn't speak well for the longevity.  Will try to take advantage of our Groupon soon.",

The atmosphere was quaint and different--albeit a bit dark.   The price was a bit high, but this place is in a fancy little shopping center, so I imagine the rent is higher than normal (excuse me, but I'm from a small town -- probably not all that fancy).   I'll just say they had the best kimchi I've had in a long time. My wife even enjoyed the food and she normally scoffs when I say I want to have Korean food. The only time I get to have it is when we go out of town, though, because there isn't a Korean joint within 3 hours of our hometown.   All of the food was delicious, but even months later I remember that kimchi. I believe I had bulgogi from there too and it was outstanding if I recall. I definitely recommend this place.",

The Asian bartender that looks kind of like the korean actor lee min ho is funny and witty, he made the experience memorable. Very knowledgeable in his alcohol, sat and talked with him for hours and didn't even realize it. Their papaya salad is the best I've ever had. I'd come back just to eat that and talk for hours with Mr lee min ho",

Decor is super cool and I absolutely recommend this place for a date if you want to look like you know all the best hidden gems in down.  Dark walls and cool frames on the wall are a nice, chic touch.  There's no better way to start out your experience here than with a cocktail.  I recommend the  Fall Fashion and the Apple Pen.  BTW-this drink was inspired by the Apple Pen video that went viral about a year or two ago...Google it and you'll totally get the name.  Apps come out pretty quick.  I've personally had the edamame, vegetable spring rolls and the dumplings (my top recommendation).  But don't fill up too much, because you HAVE to save room for a great dinner.  The Pad See Yew, Pad Thai and fried rice are all fantastic.  If you're feeling a little adventurous, go with the Bibimbap.  It's great.  I'm totally on board with this restaurant.  Although it's tucked away and you could completely miss it if you blinked while driving by, it's worth the search.",

We were promptly seated by the nicest guy in the world and waited on by the nicest waitress in the world... but neither was fake - they genuinely seemed like they were glad we were there.  For dinner, the fella got the pad thai, and I got the bulgogi. The bulgogi was sizzling when they brought it out, and the flavor was great. The onions gave it just enough spice, and the sides gave it a little kick and broke up the savory flavor. The fella loved his pad thai and was impressed at how much chicken was in there. I tried a bite, and it leaned to the sweet side, which I really liked.  Wine - glasses and bottles - was half off, so we each got a fancy glass. Those two glasses plus our entrees and tip ran us $50, which seemed perfect for what we got. I'm a fan!",

You'll find beautiful and flavorful dishes that are Thai, Japanese, and Korean (and probably more that I don't know of because of slight subtleties) and they fill you up without breaking the bank.   Located in the bottom level across from Shake Shack, Hibiscus is kind of a hidden gem. The Lady and I ordered an appetizer of their Fresh Vegetable Rolls, which are the rice paper rolls with basil leaves. Did not disappoint, especially for a vegetarian appetizer. When it came to dinner, I was actually feeling something on the lighter side, so I ordered one Tuna Tataki (lightly seared and marinated tuna slices, 4), and one bowl of Tom Kha Gai (sweet&sour coconut/chicken/mushroom soup). Both of my dishes were extremely flavorful with great texture, but the winner goes to the soup. Although an appetizer portion, I didn't want it to end.   The Lady got the crunchy dragon roll, which turned out to be more creamy than crunchy, but still, the flavors were on point and the portion sizing was great. Highly recommend!",

They have half price appetizers during the week from 4-6, so we started with the chicken skewers. They were so good. The chicken was cooked really well. It was moist and had a lot of flavor. It came with a delicious peanut sauce.   For our entrees, we got the fresh ginger an the cashew nut from the wok. They were both really good, but we both liked the cashew nut one more. The sauce had more favor and was really good. We got level 3 of spice and it had a good amount of heat to it.   We got our food really fast which could just be because there was no one there. Our waiter was attentive at first, but then my water sat empty for a while and we had to wait a while when we were done to ask for the check.   I also really liked the decor. It was dimly lit and had really cool light fixtures.   This makes the list of best Thai restaurants in Charlotte. I would come here again and recommend others to as well!",

It is no real fault of Hibiscus other than their food is mediocre, which generally speaking so are most gastronomical experiences in Charlotte.  The pad Thai and curry did their job on a lazy Saturday for take out for people with low expectations based off of the reviews of people who seem to actually know good Thai cuisine. But what was truly surprising was the fried rice. I get it, this isn't a Chinese restaurant but honestly, how hard is it to make fried rice? I had to re-fry it once we got it home because the rice was almost white with no seasoning and no egg. In fact, we had to add two scrambled eggs! So I fried it up and added soy sauce because if there was any on there already, it was undetectable. And sadly this wasn't just a one-off as we had two separate orders of two different types of fried rice and both were as bland as can be.  If you aren't going to do something well, don't put it on your menu.  So yeah, two stars for merely meeting low standards. Sadly, this spot will be far from memorable.",

We came one night with friends for a double date. Our server was so kind and very helpful in explaining the menu.  My husband and I recently travelled to Thailand, so we have been in search of similar flavors. We started with the papaya salad. This is a staple in Thailand and we were excited to try it. It was excellent, but way too spicy. We only ordered a level III spice, but the papaya must've absorbed more than other dishes.  My husband ordered the pad Thai and he was very happy with this. I ordered green curry at a level four spice, and it was delicious. I even had some to take home with me. This, surprisingly, was not as spicy as I expected.  I was able to finish the meal with mango sticky rice, which I was so excited about. I believe the serving on this was small for the price.  We did have an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert, but I did feel like things were a bit expensive. Drinks were good as well and I was pretty happy with my cocktails.  If anything, I will be back for the curry and the nice service. Price for the curry seems to be consistent with other restaurants in town.",

Both were absolutely more than we expected taste-wise. The next day we got the bibimbap and the bulgogi, two more solid dishes.   This is a great spot to take a date. The decor inside is very swanky yet soothing (make sure to check out the bathroom, it's like a spa). Also they have outdoor seating by the fountain. This will be a place we go on the regular.

My son loves Thai and I love Korean food so thought this would be the perfect place for us. The interior decor is nice and the staff equally so, but the food just did not pass muster for us.   My son got the fried rice which came with shrimp and chicken, a nice touch. But he said the taste was bland. I got the tom kha soup and bibimbap. The soup was OK, but too salty for my taste (and I like salty). The salt muted the brightness you expect from Thai soups. The bibimbap lacked flavor. The meat was ground rather than sliced, and it didn't have that delicious Korean bbq flavor you hope for in this style of cuisine. I had to keep putting gojuchang sauce on it to add flavor, but then soon enough it was just like eating rice and sauce.  Service was good. Water kept filled. And I was offered a refill of my kimchee and pickled daikon sides, which was good because they were the best tasting part of the whole meal.  This reminded me to avoid places that serve \"this AND that\" cuisine, especially if sushi also creeps in the on menu as it does here.",

Portions are always a good size and I love that I can get me some Thai food while my girlfriend gets Korean. Their Bi Bim Bap is good and I like the way they make their pad Thai and the heat isn't too subdued like a lot of other Thai places around CLT. Also Roger behind the bar is awesome and will take great care of you!",

    "text": "This was the latest stop for my dinner group. We were drawn to the place by the reviews on Yelp as well as the pictures. But unfortunately, things didn't turn out so well for our group.  I got there early and sat at the bar for a drink before the rest of the group. I enjoyed their mostly local beer tap selection and enjoyed talking with the bartender on beer.  When the group was seated that's when things took a turn downhill. There was one server for the entire restaurant and it was quite busy. He tried to keep up but the service just suffered.  We started with appetizers. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. While they were good, I felt there was something missing like a sauce?   For an entree I ordered Grandma's Bibimbap which I heard was good here and I had never had Korean food (other than kimchi) before. While it came out presented well, my egg was over fried and not as pretty and the ones in the pictures on Yelp. The flavors were good but the chili paste which I thought was going to add some heat to the dish was quite disappointing. I didn't have the guts to ask for a bottle of siraccha. The kimchi that came with it was good as well as the pickled daikon but I really didn't care for the fish cake.  The good things about this restaurant are:  1. Friendly staff 2. Fresh ingredients and they try to support local as much as possible. 3. Food and cocktail items are beautifully presented.  The bad things:    1. Service issues:  Drink orders were never placed, were extremely slow coming out and when they did come out, they were for wrong drink. 2. Didn't even ask if we wanted dessert, just brought the checks out. I ended up next door at Ben & Jerry's for my ice cream.  I'd really like to try this place again. Perhaps, I will try their Thai options. I was eyeing my table mate's Fresh ginger meal which looked amazing.",

The orders took about 25 minutes longer than that. Ouch. So keep that in mind if you're getting some takeout.  The dinners were excellent. The curry with chicken was tasty and nicely flavorful. Lots of vegetables and lots of chicken. Just really, really good. Caramelized Pork Stew was also very good with nice pieces of pork and crispy vegetables.  I enjoyed the meals and they went over quite well. Just be patient with the timing.",

The restaurant is very up to date and stylish inside.  It's clean and the decor is great.  I was greeted by a very friendly hostess and the service was good.  My server had only been there for three days, so wasn't overly familiar with the menu, but that was ok.  The Tom Kha Gai soup was not my favorite.  I think the flavor of lemongrass is what kind of threw me off.  The coconut tasted good, though.  I ordered Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) and was disappointed with the lack of noodles.  The flavor was pretty tasty, but I would've loved to have enough noodles.  I also had a side of kimchi, which was good.  Their hot sauce and chili sauce was disappointing.  They were not hot/spicy at all compared to what I'm used to.  The flavor was kind of weird as well.  I asked for my noodles to be a 4 (from 1-5 spicy level) and it was NOT at all.  No hint of spice.    The place is a good idea..the mango sticky rice was awesome....the decor is beautiful...people are friendly.  I think I'm just used to maybe more authentic, spicy food? I don't know.  But a lot of people like it here and I'm not knocking it, just not my personal favorite.",

I sat at the bar with a friend and can tell you that the cocktails are handmade, with each piece of fresh fruit being sliced on the spot (not pre-sliced) and muddled with care. This is a very difficult location for a restaurant to thrive, as countless other owners can attest to. However, I think Hibiscus' service, quality, and decor upgrades give it a great shot.",

Located on the lower level of the shopping complex off Wendover and Park Road in Charlotte, its ambience setting provides a warm vibe. But let's get to the point as to why we came here. The food. It is so hard to please my husband when we go out to eat because he feels my home cooked meals are always best. Which is True, but since it was our 18th year anniversary we decided to try this Southeast Asian restaurant. His verdict - He LOVED everything. This is a great restaurant for groups when everyone wants a variety. They have Korean, Laotian, Vietnamese, and Japanese. Here are the pictures of our dishes. By the way, service was superb and our dishes came out in perfect timing. We spent a full hour in the restaurant from sit down to leaving completely satisfied. Please go support this local restaurant, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "OK...I have very mixed feelings about this restaurant.  On a positive note, I like the intimate, lounge ambiance. It's very small (and tight), but quite stylish...with beautiful detailing. I also loved the perfectly complementary overhead music (cool, metro lounge?). Also, nice bathroom lol!   I've only been here twice, and they've changed their menu from my last visit...with more focus on Laotian cuisine. Anyway, I decided to try Nam Khao, a Laotian dish that was suggested by the waiter. It was good, but to be frank, the dish looked better than it actually tasted. I wish I ordered Bulgogi or Red Curry instead...those dishes looked really Dee-Lish. Also, the Sticky Rice Ice Cream dessert was a disappointment. I remember that on my last visit here, this dessert looked much more attractive, with Purple Sticky Rice (not the plain White Rice), and also topped with a beautiful flower. This time, it looked quite basic...maybe just bad? I actually recommended this once beautiful dessert to friends around the table...and well, quite disappointing.  Overall, tonight's dining experience was just awkward at best. Namely, the service was really off. There was only 1 waiter for the entire restaurant (just like last time we were there). Despite the fact the restaurant is small, there should have been at least 2 waiters/waitresses. The sole waiter struggled to serve our table of 8, as well as other diners in the restaurant...think maybe up to 6 occupied tables during our stay?   Anyway, the service was slow...sluggish even! Near the end, the waiter was more preoccupied with giving us doggy bags before even taking our dessert order (??). Our wait for the desserts also took so long that we were about to cancel our orders. Then the bills...again, took way too long, in a scattered, disorganized fashion. Also, despite the automatic 20% tip on our bills, the waiter didn't even stop by our table (at least my side of the table) even once to ask if I needed anything.   Still, I have to say that it wasn't entirely the waiter's fault. Like I said, the restaurant should have had at least 2 waiters. The kitchen staff might have been understaffed as well.   So there it is! I like the restaurant, its lounge ambiance and its diverse Asian fusion menu...but both times I've been there, the service has been less than stellar. Truly, I'd love to give this place better ratings, but I just can't. Both times, I left feeling that the service was really bad. I'm just hoping this will improve in the future.",

Food - I tried the Sukiyaki Noodle Soup, and OH MY GOSH. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did! It had celery, broccoli, mushroom, carrots, shrimp and chicken, and the broth was intense but mild at the same time. Bursting with flavors! I finished the entire bowl and was full.  Service - The host was a little snippy when I asked for a sushi menu. He said that they don't offer it anymore, and that they posted the new change on all their social media platforms.  I apologized and said that I had never been here before, that I just typed in \"sushi\" on my gps and it lead me to this restaurant.  Anyways, my actual server was very nice and prompt. Will absolutely return for that amazing soup!",

It was my first time having iced Thai tea and it was good! Really creamy and not too sweet.   The server asked me on a scale of 1-5 how spicy do I like my food and I told her a 3...and then said no 4. She went for 3. Honestly, if you like spicy food I'd do a 4. It was not spicy for me at a 3. Flavorful by far but not spicy . The staff was so freaking friendly. It's been a long time since I've had such awesome waitstaff.   I've never had chicken dumplings before so I ordered some of those fried and it was good!  The food was filling and I will definitely be back again.",

He stated that many people in the past has down that and never showed up...but ain't this the same as order for pickup/to go?!   Atmosphere: quite, dark, cute and elegant.   Food: Papaya was too salty/too fishy. Maybe too much msg/shrimp paste/fish sauce? Portion is very small for $10.00. Papaya did not seem fresh (not as crunchy) Prob would not order again.   Beef pad see yew and chicken pad Thai were very good. Defiantly would order again.  Thai tea: they put it in a cute mug and tasted pretty good.   Service: fast, friendly service.   Overall: Defiantly good place to stop and check out. They are a fusion of different things. They offer Thai, Korean, Laotian food. Good variety of things on the menu. Defiantly gotta go back and try out the other things in the menu.",

I had the tempura shrimp and it was perfectly crunchy. Also inside was crab salad (probably imitation but still tasty), lettuce, asparagus and cucumber. They even included a perfect cup of spicy mayo and eel sauce for dipping! It wasn't the biggest burrito I've ever seen but it was delicious and held together well.   The fresh veggie roll appetizer was tasty and very fresh. Lots of sliced veggies with a good crunch. They included 2 different dipping sauces - I liked both!   I'd definitely go in person or order deliver again!",

My husband called in pad Thai, crunchy dragon roll, and steamed dumplings.  We were driving back from my grandmothers so we were about 25 minutes away.    We got to hibiscus and I had the car running and my husband was in there for 20 minutes and still didn't have any food.  I walked in and it was a big ordeal to get a refund (by now it had been an hour since we called it in).  The person just said sorry about that and we got a refund about 10 minutes later.  There was no offering to give us an appetizer to wait a little longer or explanation as to why we had to wait so long.  We would have understood when calling in if we were told it's going to be an hour and a half for to go orders.  We left without food....   I love the food here so it makes me sad that I can't rely on them for big parties or to go orders.  We have decided we will just go when it's not as likely to be crowded.",

I could honestly make a meal just on those alone. We all ordered something different & split them - Pad Thai, Basil Kai Dao & Lao Sausage. My favorite was the Basil Kai Dao, 3 spicy (could have done 4, but think it would have detracted from the flavor of the food, which was great!

The Skewers had two sauces which were great. Fried Spring Rolls mild in flavor crispy outside it was the best.

I was unimpressed by the sushi burrito but my husband enjoys the edamame appetizer and I usually get the summer rolls. I absolutely LOVE the teas \"Tea Forte\" that Hibiscus serves and while they are $3 and I find this ridiculous, I've looked into purchasing tea bags from Tea Forte and they are quite expensive. The lemongrass ginger is my all time favorite and I often order this instead of a cocktail. For anyone who reads my reviews, you know this is rare!

They also told us how many servings were in an order so we would have enough to share amongst ourselves. I got the Pad See Yew and it was SUPER delicious and they did not completely drench the noodles with overwhelming sauce like Thai House at University did so you could still enjoy the dish without having to eat rice or vegetables every other bite to balance the strong taste out. If it wasn't so far away from my house, I would come back and eat here more often! Customer service was great as they attended to our needs speedily and were generous enough to bring us an extra bowl of rice for our Bulgogi, which was also delicious.

We ordered the curry soup with chicken, noodles, carrots, potatoes, etc. and they split it in two bowls for us. There was a ton of it and it was absolutely delicious! I'm not a big soup fan, but this was outstanding. We also had the dish in the big pot that crisps up the rice and has an egg, like in other reviewers photos. It was great! I had no spice so it is up to you to add to it. There is a red sauce that looks like ketchup that we enjoyed. I can't handle much spice, but I liked it mixed in my rice. The soup isn't too spicy either, but they give you things to spice it up with. The vegetable rolls were also great. I liked the sweet sauce with peanuts that came with rolls and she brought me more to mix with my rice and the spicy red sauce. We each had a cocktail and the total bill was $57. We didn't think that was bad at all for two entrees, app, and two cocktails. Def a hidden gem!",

I bet it has been there 25 years, tried and True, few surprises and few disappointments. What if it blasted into the current century and picked up a whole lot of the cool trendy influences of the last 20 years, like sushi and Vietnamese food and some things you're not real sure of where they are from but they taste good. This place is run by the same family as Thai Taste, their kids I understand and these kids have certainly been paying attention the restaurant trends over the years. The food offers great selection, reasonable prices (especially the wine list) . Atmosphere is slick and staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I wasn't real sure what I was ordering but I would go back in a heartbeat. It's different and that is harder and harder to find.",

Although the flavor was good it is not Korean Bulgogi as they advertise it.  Bulgogi is all meat, and this that you see her is a noodle dish which by the way is served with rice, so double the carbs lol. The korean side dishes were watered down for some reason watered down.

For our entrees, we went with the chef's recommendation of Grandma's bulgogi (seriously, it was the secret recipe of our waitress's grandma) and phad thai.  So good!    The staff was very kind and accommodating to our children.  I'd love to go back on date night and try out their extensive cocktail menu.  They have an amazing patio that we would have loved to enjoy if it wasn't 100 degrees that day.  Totally recommend Hibiscus.",

We had to add the red chili sauce to the curry that came with the lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were gooey and also bland.  The steak salad was in fact spicy and I asked for dressing on the side, but the dressing was already on the salad.  The steak was tough.  There's nothing \"Thai\" about this place.  I love Thai food and have been to numerous Thai restaurants and this was by far the worst Thai restaurant I've tried. Very disappointing.",

I had the crispy hibiscus sushi with tuna. Worth it! I got the fried spring rolls and Pad See Yew with chicken.  You can taste the freshness in the ingredients. They let you choose your spicy level. Well worth it. The staff is knowlegable and freindly. Ill be back again",

    "text": "Best. Food. Ever !!! The name- Hibiscus is what drawn me to this place at first. (luv at first sight??) I cannot expressed how much I love this place, the vibe & location it's in, the food, decor, service just everthang! I came here with my mom, and cousin and we were seated right away. ( they weren't super busy ) The place was on the smaller side, but it had that cozy restaurant feeling maybe because of the cute decors?? Our server was also so kind, she was really attentive, she didn't mind when we asked for substitutions & also checked on us regularly(: We literally ordered half of the menu lol! (We shared the food of course) We ordered the green curry, grandmas bimbibap, shrimp tempura burrito, seafood pancake and the purple sticky rice w/ vanilla icecream. Let me just start off telling ya the food did not fail to disappoint. I think my fav would be the seafood pancake- it came out hot and crispy! The curry, I'm legit so picky about my curry like a girl KNOWS her curry. The green curry was PERFECT; it had all the right flavors and the coconut was on point! And the PURPLE STICKY RICE?? When I saw purple & sticky rice, I was like I have to order that! Haha 2 of my fav things combined, the sticky rice had coconut milk on it and it came out warm combined with the cold vanilla ice cream it was so bomb. Don't worry about it being too sweet, I'm not an intense sweet person so this was perfect! I could just go on and on raving about this place, but if you like quality, legit tasty food- be sure check them out!!",

It was a bit on the sweet side especially since I order level 5 spicy.... unfortunately it seemed more like level 2.  Overall, I think I would try something different and maybe get takeout next time.

I had the fried spring rolls as an appetizer and the Pad See Yew for dinner. Very yummy. Cocktails were good. The only thing weird was our waiter seemed pretty out of it. Mules were on special, so I ordered one and asked that it be made with Titos (1. A pretty common vodka mules are made with 2. Titos was used in several of their cocktails) and the waiter looked really confused and said, \"I don't know if we can do that.\" I was confused and asked \"Why not?\" And he was really frazzled and confused. I had to tell him Titos is a common vodka used for mules and that I know they have it. Seemed like something he should know. It was just a really strange interaction.",

I agreed, but not sure why they charge an extra dollar to serve it in a way they believe is better??  But it was great.   Dumplings are very good, nice thin skin and not too chewy.  Pad Thai also good, not going to blow your hair back but is one of the better preparations in the Queen City.  Love that they have Wooden Robot beer on tap. Good Morning Vietnam is awesome and the rest of the taps are good as well.  Prices are fair given the neighborhood. Wonder how they are going to do when the Korean fried chicken joint opens next door.",

I had actually avoided trying out Hibiscus because it seemed like yet another Asian restaurant in Charlotte trying to boil the ocean (er, continent) with Korean, Thai, and sushi. Amazingly, they seemed to do it all well, though we didn't order the sushi on this trip.   We had the bibimbap and the ginger stir fry. Both were flavorful, came out quickly, and the kimchi side was perfect. The staff was friendly, attentive, and did a great job with the table side presentation -- several tables near us ordered the flaming sushi dish. Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!",
