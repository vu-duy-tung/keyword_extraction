    "text": "IDENTITY CRISIS???? So let me be clear. The burger was ok on its way to being good.  The service was what it is at a place like this. Young man politely took order and later brought to my table.  So where is the reason I gave them three stars??? I thought maybe it should of been 2 star.   So I am not one to typically order a $9-12 dollar burger for lunch, but I did today.  Here is my beef with this place and why I honestly do not think they will be in business long.  We agree it's a pricey lunch burger. With that burger come a few good things such as unusual toppings, but what is important is what you don't get. 1. I ordered burger fries and water.  For 14$ I get a cup for water that is the size of a specimen cup.  If I'm paying 14$ for a burger, I'm not here to rip off 5 extra ounces of Diet Coke. 2.  If you want salt/pepper, get ready to go get a hand full of those packs that have a miniscule amount of product in them. 3. Napkins- what can I say? They are the kind that if you touch them, they disintegrate.  Cheap cheap 4. Condiments-  if you want them you have to go to front station and fill those miserable little souffle cups. So the lesson is thus. I think if you pay twice the going rate or more for a burger, some things like a ketchup bottle, salt and pepper shaker and a napkin that stays together are warranted.  If you are cutting corners that drastically on the front of the store, i shutter to think how and witg what you are cutting in the back of the store.  Good luck, I feel you will need it.",

The burger did have great flavor, but again it was practically cold. Three different waiters came to get our drink order. It is to my understanding that the table service is a new concept here, and I would really recommend to this business to go back to ordering at the counter. The manager was walking around seemingly oblivious to the fact that anything was wrong, but it was clear that all the tables around us were unhappy as well. We were very excited to try Blacow but hate to say we won't be back unless there are some major changes.",

Really high quality meat served on a very good Brioche bun. The fries are crispy, both the standard and the sweet potato fries. I tried the Brussels sprouts, and they were excellent. Not inexpensive, but well worth what you pay for the quality. They have recently changed from ordering and paying at the counter to a full service restaurant. This is OK, but hopefully the service will be better once it catches on. I highly recommend Blacow for a good burger and fries!",

    "text": "We tried out this place for the first time based on positive Yelp reviews but unfortunately did not have the same experience as the 4 and 5 star reviewers. We were there around 4:30 on a Sunday. We ordered The Hangover with mac & cheese and The Swiss Fun-Ghi with poutine. Simply put, we were completely underwhelmed and everything was mediocre at best. Nothing special about anything we tried. I think The Hangover could use one less layer so that it can be picked up and eaten without using a fork and knife. I started to order a draft beer but was told there was no alcohol sales on Sunday. I asked if that was a SC law or county law, and the waitress said no, it was due to \"lack of documentation.\" I'm not sure what that meant but just said ok and ordered water. Speaking of the waitress, she was a very sweet girl, but she was sweating profusely, to the point that sweat was pouring down her cheeks. Honestly, it turned my stomach and made me lose my appetite a bit because I kept thinking it was going to drip into my drink or food. And last but not least, the restaurant itself looked grimy and dirty. They weren't busy at all yet most of the tables weren't clean when we arrived (in fact, the waitress had to wipe down our table after we sat down), and the floors and windows were filthy. Also, I would suggest playing some music. To not be crowded, the restaurant was very loud due to several small children, and I think some background music would help drown out some of the noise. Based on this visit, I don't think we'll be going back.",

Once you are seated you are often served by some kid who has no idea how to wait a table. Half the time I have to go refill my own glass.

Our waiter was a nice young man, but still...why the change??  The interior is still set up for counter service, so it just feels odd (and I hate to say it, but maybe a bit desperate?) that it isn't. It was peak lunch time and there were only two other tables, so I'm wondering if others feel the same.   A big positive is that I will say the food seemed better than I remembered. I had a fried chicken sandwich that was really, really good. My son's hamburger was great.   Please bring back counter service - at least at lunch!",

Hoping this is just an experiment to compete with recently opened Smashburger, and fingers crossed Blacow returns to the original fast casual format.  With the old format, as a family of 6 we could enjoy a great meal in 30 minutes.  The new format (albeit with early kinks) is 2-3x slower.  Blacow, please bring back fast causal!  We  Blacow.  Great meal, very family friendly format with \"fast casual\" (think Pei Wei, Panera, etc).  Located in the space formerly occupied by Jumpin Java, this is a welcome addition to the Baxter area of Fort Mill.  Some of my favorites: any burger with the Wagyu beef, the brussel sprouts with balsamic (def beats fries), and the salted caramel milkshakes.  The kids like the macaroni and cheese, or the cut fruit, as sides, and of course any of the milkshakes.  Atmosphere is relaxed and clean.  Service is fast and low key.",

    "text": "I'd like to preface the 3 stars with, this place probably makes the BEST burgers in Fort Mill. I'm a big fan of getting my burgers medium-rare and trust few places to get it right. Tonight we had the Caballero and the Gangnam, specialty burgers with a more SoCal and Korean flavors that I'd rate 4.5. Mac and Cheese has perfectly balanced pepper with the cheese. Fries are consistent, crunchy and fresh.  Understanding that this is a small business, sometimes it's difficult to monitor order accuracy and keeping pricing consistent. In this case it was the Poutine which didn't have the gravy, and the younger staff probably didn't understand that I was testing the service by calling and telling them of the issue to see their response outside of an apology, which we at least got the apology.  Also pricing between the website and the menu for the two burgers were a $1 difference between online and the in store menu, easily reconciled by updating the website to $10 per burger.  That being said, if none of these things bother you, I'd recommend hitting this place up if you've never been there. Food came out in the 15 minutes promised and the staff is friendly.",

My only wish item is for better wine choices.   My husband and I plan to bring all our out-of-town guests to visit and have recommended this place to our neighbors who now love it too.   Great for either lunch or dinner. Service has been very friendly and it is kept clean.   Enjoy!",

There was a bit of confusion at the register when we ordered but once everything was settled we got our plasticware and took a seat. Our original table was wobbly so we decided to move. My chocolate shake came out first and it was delicious. Our food followed which was two hangover burgers one truffle oil fries and one poutine fries. We may have been in pain from the drinks the night before and over ordered in hopes of alleviating the consequences of those choices. The hamburgers may not have had large patties but with everything they put in the hangover burger it sure was huge! Each fry side we got was more than enough for two people. My truffle fries were amazing they tasted as if they had been hanging out in a truffle oil pool just moments before coming it me. But in a good way I promise! My boyfriend's vanilla shake came out when we were about half way done with our food.   There were a few kinks that were expected as a new place but our meal was delicious. I will have to return to try another one of their burgers. While I enjoyed my hamburger there were so many items other than hamburger I can't quite attest to the quality of their meat.",

    "text": "Blacow's menu looked pretty unique among area burger joints and the food more than made good on that promise.  I traveled from Charlotte to eat with my parents and we ordered poutine, onion rings, mac and cheese, and three burgers.  Mine was the Nutty Goat (which I had heard won the Moo & Brew burger competition) and I ordered it rare with an upgrade to a wagyu patty. Unlike some other people who have complained about the service they received, our teenage waiter was an attentive and courteous kid.    The burger was fantastic.  They are way more filling than they appear and the amount of tastes and textures combining on the Nutty Goat is like a symphony in your mouth!  The sweetness and crunch of the balsamic onions mixed with the smoothness of the goat cheese blended well with the texture of the pecans and pickles, which lended helpful acidity to the whole mixture.  The patty was cooked right to temp and was bloody and delicious.  The bun did get a bit soggy but when you order rare, you best be prepared for that!  This was hands down one of the best burgers I've eaten in the Charlotte area and competes with Hops in Greensboro for best in state.    The mac and cheese was pedestrian and the poutine, although a novelty in these parts, was underwhelming. But the the onion rings saved the day in the sides department!  They were perfectly battered, super tasty even without the sauce that accompanied them.  Don't leave without eating some.  Plus there is a coupon in the GoPlaySave book for a free burger here to lighten the bill!  I strongly recommend if you're a burger hunter you seek this place out.",

The next 2 are the caballa and this month's special with like 3 types of bacon. Everyone enjoyed theirs and was a pleasant surprise. The fries were nice too.  Sweet tea was not overly sweet which is the way I like it.  It would have gotten 5 stars except for wait to be seated. They weren't overly crowded but needing to be seated as a little bit pointless. Would be better to leave the menu on the tables and just keep an eye on who's coming in.  Definitely will be coming back again. So many options that need to be tried out",

I can't believe a manger that can't stand up for a paying guest chose a waitress that was really, rude, wrong, and nasty as a person. I took video and sent it to all the news stations.

The burger was ok, a little overcooked. It was also a little under seasoned. The cheese was good and spicy. Not crazy spicy but it definitely had a kick to it. I didn't care for the jalapeno chips. It was very bready (is that even a word?). I also got the onion rings, they were pretty good.   My coworker got the funghi burger and she said there were only 3 mushrooms on it. She said it was just ok. My other coworker got the chicken cali burger-it came with the grilled chicken, avocado and chipotle ranch and bacon. She said the chicken was a little dry. They also got fries with their order and thought they were average. One asked for a side of chipotle ranch and was told that they didn't have chipotle ranch which was strange since it came with the cali burger. Someone got the onion straws and thought they were good and spicy.   Overall, this place has potential. It's worth a try. It is al la carte though!",

I walked in, was immediately greeted by a very nice waitress (I shoulda got her name, apologies). I told her it was my first time, and was tryna see what they were all about. She was very knowledgeable in the menu and was very kind and attentive to me, big plus. I had the \"caballero\" burger, and French fries. The fries were delicious, but the burger was so-so :/. I expected more flavor from what I got, but it wasn't really there. Just tasted like a regular burger no big deal, so perhaps next time I'll go with something a bit different I guess. Restaurant was clean, and dishes, cups, cutlery were as well.   Only downside in my opinion:  *flavor. Again it could just be my choice of burger.  *they played Michael Jackson music in the kitchen, instead of the actual restaurant. And I like MJs music, so please play it on the sound system. Eh, that's more of a plus I guess lol.",

We received the fries about 10 minutes before our burgers came out which was annoying, but seemed common amongst the other customers. When we tried to get Ketchup, they were out of Heinz in the pump and gave us some fancy ketchup packets. Being originally from south of Pittsburgh, this was a terrible substitute. The Hand Cut fries however were fried well and tasted fresh. The Sweet Potato fries needed salt.   After finally receiving the burgers with now cold fries in hand, the Gobble patty was pre packaged, not fresh ground turkey and didn't have sprouts because they were out.  They have been open for a week and are out of sprouts and Ketchup. Get with the program. The Classic had too much bread to meat ratio, the sauce had a strong vinegar taste and the bottom bun was stale.   Analysis: Two trips in one. 1st and last.  Spend your money at American Burger Co. they have it figured out better there.",

I had the blacow burger which has tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze with some other things. It's fantastic. The meat is fresh and a combo and top quality meat - Wagyu, short rib etc.  Took our friends today and they got the big willie - has pork belly bacon on the burger - they said was he best burger they've ever had.  I must admit - if not the best, it's top 3... The onion rings are the best I've had for sure. Not overly greasy and the sauce is great!   I read people complaining about price - As I did about Wahlbugers in Myrtle Beach.. But the prices here are not bad at all based on the type of meat used and the creations with the Asian fusion. You will pay $10-$12 for your burger entree but that also include your side. This isn't McDonalds so stop thinking that should be the price you pay. I'm telling you, the food here is incredible.   The fries could have been warmer - but didn't change my opinion. We love this place and will be back often.    My next choice will be the flaming cow that should pack a lot of heat. Ghost pepper jack, jalapeno coins, surracha etc.    Anyway, hope you try it and enjoy as much as we did.",

There's a sign that reads \"Please wait to be seated\".  Do we wait at the front or walk to the counter in the back to order?  Well, we walked to the counter to order (like we always had in the past) and then when we said we would be dining in they sat us at a table and took our order there.  You can't be fast casual and table service, it's just awkward.  But, the burgers are still fantastic!  So that's worth 3 stars.  P.S.  bus your tables and sweep your floors throughout dinner service, it's gross  P.S.S.  stop closing off tables by flipping chairs up onto them while people are still in the restaurant, you're either open or closed, not both. And it was only 8:30 on a Friday.",

    "text": "Of course, my eye was drawn to the expensive burgers on the menu and so I enjoyed their Hangover Burger even though I was not hung over. Big beef patty, bacon, cheese, a fried egg and a french fries/poutine thing on the burger. When delivered to my table, the thing was seven inches tall. Do people try and bite into this monster?  I took much of the burger apart and ate some with knife and fork until it was down to a manageable size. Tasty beef and the egg was nice. Bacon was very bacony.  For my side dish, I chose the mac & cheese which was okay not great. A big portion but needed sriracha for some kick.  Great service and a neat spot that's right off the highway and easy access. Yum!",

The Parmesan truffle fries used to be my favorite, but they are different now and not as good. Maybe not fresh cut anymore? Not sure but the last 2 times we went they weren't like they used to be. We like their beer selection, though the drafts were not very cold last time.  The service has always been great, every burger we've had has been phenomenal, the Mac and cheese (if it's still the same)  and Brussels sprouts are delicious too.  All that said, Blacow is still really good and we love that they use coupons, so we will definitely be going back. I miss those fries though!",

With all the fresh ingredients they show on the menus the execution of the sides are beyond sub par.  The Mac and cheese was ok. Noodles were over cooked.  Service was lacking with it only being six tables equaling 9 people.  Management and ownership needs to revise there menus and help.",

They have truffle fries too! Our $17 meal consisted of the blacow burger, parmasean truffle fries, and a soda. It filled both of us up and we still have a little bite of the burger and some fries leftover. You order ur food and they bring it to your table -  like mcallisters. I'm very satisfied with our food. I would definitely recommend! I personally loved the fried tofu on our burger but my boyfriend said he would've like fresh avocado instead. The burger has a nice teriyaki type sauce that compliments the avocado well.   I recommend eating your truffle fries with ketchup as it really enhances the ketchup for me and made it taste like umami burgers house made ketchup.",

The onion rings are excellent and they give you a savory sauce that goes well.  Ordered the truffle fries once and was not impressed-almost a shoestring fry, with minimal truffle flavor, would not spend the extra money again.  Local craft beers on tap is a bonus. Service is upbeat and curteous-order at the counter, they bring you your food to the table and always follow up to see how the food is and to clean empties.  My only complaint, (and this is slight), is that we always ask for medium rare burgers and they are usually cooked medium, the reason we eat the burger instead of sending it back is that it is still flavorful and juicy, but we will continue to work on that medium rare request next time.  As a burger connoisseur, I would recommend.",

Nothing special, but nothing terrible either.   Service-only 1 girl working that I saw. She was very nice and greeted me with a smile, which surprisingly doesn't happen everywhere. She was also the person serving food to tables. Over all, she was very pleasant  Food-let's start off with burger. It was presented well and looked very good, but that was not the case. It lacked flavor and meat had pieces of fat or something that I could've chew. Fries were bland and Mac n Cheese was just ok.   Tip-it was almost completely empty, only 1 person in entire place. Guess, that should've told me something.",

My friend had hot dogs with onion rings, while I had a burger with fries.  The problem was, our food sat up at the counter for too long.  I saw it up there and tried to get attention of the only server that seemed to be working (not ours), who had tables on the other side of restaurant.    Our server didn't attend to us at all, less when we finally got our food.  She didn't check in on us or bring refills.  We had to flag down someone else to bring our checks.  I considered sending my food back but after waiting 20 min for a burger, I didn't want to wait while they fixed another one.   What made it worse was they weren't busy at all.  We were one of 3 tables in entire place.    It likely would have been good if we could have gotten food timely and serviced.  I just don't know that I will be back to get the same experience, not for a burger.",

Burgers are generally pretty safe, so I opted to stop at Blacow while I kept an eye on the weather.  I got the slightly-unfortunately-named F.R.O.G. burger, but it makes more sense when you learn it has a fig, raspberry, orange, and ginger reduction. This reduction also holds together the arugula, bacon and a very thick slice of basil goat cheese.  The verdict? Not bad. The fries were awesome. The burger was cooked medium-well, when I prefer medium (and I wasn't asked how I liked my burger, either), a mistake that seems to compound when using short ribs as meat, as the meat part of it was drier than it should have been. The taste was unaffected, fortunately.  As for the other components, they tasted good individually but overall it didn't quite get to \"top burger\" status. It's probably more of a quibble than anything else, as overall I'd still rate it a very good burger. After all, that reduction was delicious.  Worth stopping by!",

When we arrived the tables weren't cleaned or wiped down, as we looked around we also noticed how the floors appeared to not have been swept what looked like in days. The bathroom wasn't the cleanest either. Being that it was all of probably two customers in here sitting down when we arrived im just a little confused to why it wouldn't be a little more tidy ?

I got the Flaming Cow burger and the brussel sprouts. The burger was excellent-  spicy while still maintaining good flavor. The real gem was the brussel sprouts though. They are fried and then tossed in a balsamic glaze. Highly recommend. Service was excellent and I was in and out in 20 mins. Will definitely seek this place out next time I'm in Fort Mill!",

The waitress came right away with the menu and explained everything to us, including the special of the day and that every Wednesday they have wings 50 cent a piece. My husband and I both decided to go with the special of the day. A hamburger with triple bacon, candied, jalapeno and apple smoked, I have Parmesan truffle fries and my husband the onion rings as side.  They menu is very interesting with good options and they price is regular.  I fell in love with my French fries and the onion rings were pretty good too. We didn't like the ranch dressing, however they had a dressing of their own that was good! I enjoyed my burger very much, it wasn't the best I've ever had but was good and most importantly, cooked the way I ordered it - medium rare. I really enjoyed the service and how fast the food was done.  I can't wait to go back and try their wings!",

I ordered the sweet potato fries with it and they were the perfect complement; string sized, were pleasantly crispy with a nice complement of saltiness. The presentation of the fries was inviting to the palate. The wife enjoyed her 'Cabellero' burger with avacado, crisp string onion rings, and bacon. Certainly Blacow beckons me to come back and try my most favorite salad, the Lettuce Wedge Salad.",

But to be fair theres not much you really can do to a burger that can change the game.  Reason why i gave it 3 star is because I do think its a bit pricey to pay $13/&17 (Me: Burger, truffle fries, and water Friend: Waygu, reg fries, tea) for lunch.  They should at least have lunch specials to keep cost down.  Staff was friendly with good service.  I would go back if i'm craving for a burger.  Good Luck!!!",

While pregnant with my 2 daughters, that's all I craved and all that I ate. I've eaten everything from the $20 fancy burgers to the $1 fast food burgers so I know the difference in the quality of the burger.  With that said, I order the flaming cow burger with an order of cheese fries and a coffee shake. You could tell the fries were fresh, not like McDonald's fries and the coffee shake was good, not too sweet. The burger was definitely the best part of the meal though. The meat was cooked perfectly and you could taste that it was a good quality beef patty. Instead of tasting like rubber, it actually tasted like meat. The ghost pepper jack cheese added a nice kick to the burger along with the sriracha mayo.   The staff was very friendly and the overall we had a wonderful experience. I would definitely come back here and would recommend Blacow to anyone who's looking for good quality food.",

Prices and menu are chef quality but all else is at a minimum budget. Menu doesn't match fast food quality condiments and accessories. I don't know when it became acceptable to pay restaurant prices and have everything else at minimum effort and budget.

They keep changing up how they do business sometimes it's walk up, order and pY then wait for it. Other times it wait to be seated and waited on. The food is good but a little on the expensive side.",

    "text": "The burgers supposedly use Japanese Black cow beef, but that is not accurate. The burgers were no better than any chain restaurant and very overpriced. The one good thing about our order today is that they offer more side items than just French fries. My husband ordered their Signature burger (The Blacow) with sweet potato fries. My burger was so dry I could not even eat it. I ordered a cheeseburger and fruit from the kid's menu since I am currently undergoing chemotherapy and cannot eat much. They were very reluctant to allow me to do that, and yes, I understand that technically I am not a child; however I have never had a problem in any other restaurant given my circumstance.  Overall, we feel that it was False advertisement because, again, we highly doubt the meat was Japanese Black cow beef.",

The tempera fried avocado really brought the burger together. My side of mac and cheese was good. My boyfriend got a side of it too and ate all of it. He enjoyed his ghost pepper burger. His mom got the steam bun burger she didn't really like it (she ended up eating half of his dad's Hawaiian burger) but she loved love loved the home cut fries. Overall we had a good experience I would come back. The price wasn't too expensive and the other burgers intrigued me (it also helps that I live close by).",

I got the Korean Pork BBQ burger, my Mom got the Hawaiian burger, and my stepdad got the Hangover Burger. For sides me and my stepdad got fries and my Mom got their Brussel sprouts.    They had some really cool combinations that are creative and will take you out of your comfort zone if you want.   The food I didn't come out super quickly I would say maybe 15 minutes but the service was nice.   I think that the burger was great, cooked well, juicy, my Korean Pork burger had a little spice to it. The fries were fresh they reminded me of Five Guys fries without all of the grease. My Mom's brussels were so good with a hint of balsamic vinegar. I didn't like Brussel sprouts before.   I think my expectations were super high and the burgers weren't life changing hence no 5-stars, but I would definitely go back anytime for a good quality burger.",

I had the burger of the month, which was a pimento cheese burger with fried pickles.  It was really nicely-flavored patty that was cooked as ordered to a medium-rare.  As a side, I got the roasted brussels sprouts, which were amazing!  The were crispy and nice, and topped with a delicious balsamic glaze.  My wife got the chili cheese burger, which she enjoyed.  To me, the chili overpowered the flavor of the burger, but that's a personal taste.  They had many, many interesting burget options on the menu that I'd be intetested in trying.  My only criticism would be that the burgers could be a bit thicker, at least as an option.  I definatley recommend Blacow, it was an excellent burger!",

My turkey burger was awful , burgers are normally juicy and fresh. This turkey burger tasted frozen to me not juicy nor did it have a grill taste.  The cheese fries were fries with that melted cheese like Taco Bell uses :( The onion rings were okay nothing special just onion rings with no flavor. My friend said her burger tasted like a frozen burger very disappointing.  This burger place was not for me for a what tasted frozen burger to me I paid 30 for our burgers. I feel like I should have just went on down to HOBOs.",

I tried the wings for the first time yesterday.  Two words to you TRY THEM!!!  They hit all the marks.  Big, meaty wings, fried to perfection and coated with an amazing, tasty sauce or finish.  I tried the Korean BBQ and Garlic Parmesan yesterday.  The Korean BBQ was a smash hit.  Tangy and spicy and quite possibly my favorite wing of all time (so far).  Garlic Parmesan was tasty as well.  As an added bonus a mix up at the kitchen gave me an added 6 buffalo style and I tasted one.  Good buffalo flavor!!!  Blacow is one of my favorites in the area and I suggest you go.  Next time, the poutine is on my list!!",

It used to be fast casual with more Korean inspired burgers, but now it's a sit down and most of the Korean inspiration seems to be gone.   The menu is still awesome. I decided to go with the nutty goat burger this time. The goat cheese was awesome. I also tried some of my friends hangover burger which was pretty good, but a lot going on. We tried the Parmesan truffle fries, the cheesy bacon ranch fries, and the poutine. My favorite was definitely the cheesy bacon ranch. I've had the Brussels sprouts and they are awesome.   I didn't have room for dessert this time, but I definitely want to try a shake sometime.   Now that it's a sit down restaurant, the service seems to be a little slow, but the food makes up for it.   I definitely recommend trying out this place for some great burgers!",

My companion requested no tomato and poutine as the side but didn't get those requests.  I asked for no chipotle ranch on my sandwich but received it anyway.

I told the waiter when I sat down that we were sort of in a hurry, and they did their part with extra attentive service. My burger was fantastic. Excellent taste. You can also get different sides here other than just fries. My wife got fries which were very good. I got the Brussel sprouts, which were also yummy. Unfortunately, they had some issue with their alcohol license and were not serving beer (not sure how that happens, but a big miss). However, the burger was excellent, one of the best I've ever had.

Usually you just walk up to the front, place your order and find a seat...fast food style. They have changed their service where it is now dine in...restauramt style where they seat you and take your order. All I could say is that I am very disappointed. Poor customer service. After we got seated another couple walked in and was seated. They waited about 5-10 minutes to have someone to take their order. 5-10 minutes may seem short but they were not busy at all. The waiter who seated them didnt even bother coming back to take their order. Another girl came and  took their drink order...took another 10 minutes for them to get their drink so they got up and left. We finally got our food and my husband had ordered chilli cheese fries. Of course they didnt provide him with a fork or anything so he ended up eating the chilli cheese fries with his hands. Im disappointed and sad to see what have become of this place. They need to change back. The food is great but we will no longer be coming back to Blacow.",

The bun was freshly made and nice and warm.  The patty was amazing....melted in your mouth.  My wife who barely eats meat and doesn't like burgers even loved it and commented that that's one burger she could eat regularly.  Too bad theres nothing like this here in Seattle.  We'll be back some day to try others.",

    "text": "This is truly a gourmet burger with an Asian twist. This place was recommended by our friends so we decided to give it a try. We were well pleased to say the least! The service was great and the staff was friendly. You order up front and take a number, once the food is ready they serve it to you at your table. They even clear your table after. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so they were kind enough to cut our burgers in half so we could all share between the two couples. My favorite burger is the blacow it was well seasoned. Moist with a touch of sweetness but not too much where it was overpowering. The poutine fries was to die for! It's a huge portion that could be shared by the whole table.  Parmesan fries and onion rings where good as well. I loved the fact that the fries stayed crispy even though there was a gravy like sauce drizzled on top. The hangover had everything but the kitchen sink on it! It was my next favorite burger. To me it was a perfect combination of ingredients therefore it didn't even need ketchup or anything else added. The best part is that the burgers are made to order just the way you like it. We like ours medium rare, most places won't cook it that way and if they do they always screw it up but here ours burgers came out perfectly. They use high quality beef and ingredients and apparently the buns are made from scratch! That's why you can definitely tell the deference between a gourmet burger versus a McDonalds or five guys burger, they just don't even compare to here! It may be pricey than other burgers because it's not your regular burger.... Its well worth the price for the type and quality you get. Wish we had one where I live because I would definitely be coming back!",

Try the parmesan garlic fries on the side. Nice beer selection for a burger place. But I especially want to commend the service. The guy at the counter explained the menu and helped us narrow down our choices. The food was brought out to the table very promptly. Everyone was quite courteous. The dining area is spacious and there are various sizes of booths and tables to accommodate different size groups.  Multiple TV 's throughout but the volume is kept low so it's not a sports bar atmosphere. Great experience and will be back.",

    "text": "This place is in a good location, halfway between downtown Fort Mill and Tega Cay.  Although it is located in a small strip mall, the interior is really pretty and every chair is padded (unlike some of the area's newer burger spots).    You order at the counter, but food is delivered to your table.  I ordered The Nutty Goat, the weekly special, which was a burger with garlic herb goat cheese, pecans, pickles, pickled onions, and chipotle aioli.  I asked for it without pickle but it came with.  I ended up removing the pickled onions - they were tasty, but there were a lot of them and since they were cold, I felt like they were detracting from the burger.    The burger was DELICIOUS; one of the better burgers I've had, and the best in Fort Mill by a considerable margin.  I ordered onion straws as my side and they were equally good - perfectly crisp with a subtle spice to the breading.  The salted caramel milkshake did not taste like either salt or caramel to me but I have no complaints, because it was really good - perfectly thick and creamy with excellent flavor.  Quibbles:  the price - my meal, which included a bottle of water, was close to $20.00 with tax, which is kind of a lot for a Saturday burger lunch - and the pacing.  My bottle of water was delivered 4 minutes after I ordered; within 15 minutes of the order I had my food.  My shake, however, did not appear until almost 25 minutes after the order, and only after I had returned to the counter to ask about it (I had forgotten initially that I'd ordered it; the person dropping off my food did not mention it at all.)  Regarding pricing:  I saw some reference in reviews to a $7 burger. All burgers today were between $9-$12; the weekly special was $11.00.  All sides are listed as \"Starters\" on the menu at $4 in price; the menu indicates burgers come with hand-cut fries.  I asked if I could have something else, and was told I could select from any of their sides.  Two thumbs up on those onion straws:  MUCH better than the other local joint.  Oh, and the bottle of water was $1.50 - I was happily surprised with that price.",

The dining room was pretty filled with it and the bathroom was even worse. Could definitely smell it in my clothes afterwards. The fries were good if not a little greasy and desperately under seasoned. Not a big issue as that is what salt and pepper is for table side. Had the Wagyu burger which was again underseasoned and a tad over cooked. Again, not a huge issue as I can address that next time by ordering it medium rare to rare. The bun was, I fear, a tad stale or maybe just of the firmer variety. Nine if these issues were a huge deal and the 4 stars is because it has huge potential - I would definitely recommend it as I am sure they will get better over time",

The other sandwich was the opposite. However both were a little bit dry on the meat part. Other than that, it was delicious. The cilantro, carrots and all the other additions to the sandwich made it very flavorful. The rice bun with nice and soft and fluffy and the sauce they used was delicious.

    "text": "In terms of creativity this place gets a 6/5. Very creative concoctions and that means a lot to me. Probably the most creative in the area. And the only place I know of that sells a Wagyu burger.   The burgers (that I've had) have been good...which I just checked to see the name of one and it seems to be removed from their menu online. The blacow is also good.   So why a 3? Inconsistency. I feel like the business is having somewhat a crisis of identity with a fairly recent push to have servers vs ordering and having it delivered (not sure if this is so the customers now shoulder more of the responsibility of paying for the runners', now servers', paycheck?). It also feels weird to walk into a place not designed to have a \"wait to be seated\" section, and then wait. I saw a couple people walk in and want to order and stand there confused as to why they now needed to wait.   Speaking of, The wait has always been long, and now it's been longer the last two times I went and there's been servers taking orders since now I have to wait to be seated. Decide. Wait for the server to take my drink order. Get my drinks. Then food order. Then wait for it to come out. Then wait for the check, wait for them to run my card, and wait for my card to be returned. The old way of order, pay, food delivered, & eat was much better. Regardless of if I've been one of two tables or there's been a normal amount of people, the wait has always been long every time. Not a place you can come to if you're on a lunch break at work.   The price was a tad high before having servers (to a degree rightfully so), now it's even higher since you have to tip.   I want to end on a high note - the ambiance is great with industrial details and low lit mood lighting and the staff is always nice.   Overall, I'd still recommend it if you want a new burger or comfort food experience. Avoid it on kids night or during rush hours. I'd return a lot more frequently if they went back to self order, looked into the delays, and brought back the Frog (I think that was its name) burger.",

For side we had Garlic Parmesan Truffle Fries as well as Mac and Cheese.  Again, both were pretty darn good.  My hold negative about this spot is they don't seem to be able to handle burger temps well.  I asked for my burger medium and it definitely came out well done.  It was a wagyu beef burger and in my opinion it is a crime to cook that well done.  All in all it had fantastic flavor though.  The Tempura avocado on the Blacow burger brought a lot of flavor and great texture to that burger.  I really enjoyed the authentic flavor of the Korean pulled pork at well.  Cant wait to get back there and try some other menu items.  The chicken wings sound great and so does the poutine.   I didn't make it to a shake, but they looked tasty.  The staff was super friendly and super helpful with explanations of the menu.  Great spot to check out with family or with friends.",

Lots of unique menu items.   I got the Blacow Burger, Kim got the Hangover and Michael got the Flaming Cow.  Thumbs up across the board.  They went traditional with fries and I picked balsamic vinegar baked brussel sprouts.  Darn fine choice.   Service could have been faster, but it was worth the wait.",

My burger, the Blacow, which was the 2nd one, was super well done. It was so well done that the char on the outside was nothing but completely burnt meat. The other burger was cook medium well but she said it had almost no flavor.  Overall way too pricey for burnt, flavorless burgers.   1st and last vist.",

Our little boy ordered macaroni and cheese which tasted rancid- he wouldn't eat it at all, and I didn't blame him after tasting it myself.

A bit on the pricey side for what it was, but very tasty and a great blend of flavors.  The service was pretty slow considering how empty the restaurant was. Our food sat ready at the counter for almost 10 minutes while the food runner/cashier bussed tables. I thought this was weird since the restaurant was almost completely empty and there was no shortage of clean tables for anyone who might have come in. We gave the benefit of the doubt - thought maybe fries were still cooking and that was why our food wasn't being brought over, but when we finally got our food, the fries were barely lukewarm and not great. I threw most of them out.  The customer service was also not superb. I got the feeling the guy who rang us up and brought our food may have been new. He seemed like he didn't want to be taking our order or something and I felt a bit uncomfortable. Although, the guy who took our trays before we left was very nice!  That said, the burger was yummy enough that I'd probably give them another chance. Hopefully this review will help them improve!",

No one was in a hurry to greet or seat us and when we sat down the friendly server  offered us beverages.  We had planned on going and trying the wings solely for the great deal because Empire has incredible wings around the corner for the same regular price but we wanted to take advantage of the deal to test out these wings. The server informed us they stopped the wing deal about 2 weeks ago. We excused ourselves and ate elsewhere.  This place does have a yummy burger and I would recommend that and the fries. It is a little pricey when you add the drink and a side but the burger and sides were yummy in the past. I was really turned off by the chairs being flipped over with 20 minutes left until close. I'd probably go at lunch but will likely not plan to try again for dinner knowing how eager they are to close.",

The classic is what I ordered and it tasted like a Whopper from Burger King (don't get me wrong I loved the whopper from BK, but I hadn't had one since I was little and don't eat much fast food). However, the Classic came with the Blacow sauce. The blacow sauce is thousand island. I also ordered a strawberry vanilla shake and it was really good!!!! The customer service was good as well!

I need to talk about the guacamole by itself for a second. Usually I'm dissapointed with the guac that comes on a burger. Its like they dont try to add flavor, might as well just be mashed avocado.   NOT THIS PLACE! I would eat that guac in a bowl with a spoon. So good. I kind of want another one even though I'm full up.

Once he realized that we were separating the meals to different people, he took the initiative to bag the meals individually, labeled each one, and added napkins, condiments, and silverware to each. I was really blown away because this made the lunch drop off 100x easier.  I didn't personally try the food but everyone raved about how great it is :)",

An interesting menu that definitely peaks curiosity with items like the Gangnam Burger, southern chicken club, bacon ranch cheese fries.... balsamic glazed brussel sprouts.... yup.... I'm right at home!  I opted for the Gangnam burger with grilled  chicken instead of the short rib burger. And it was definitely good!  Juicy with a great umami flavor that I think of when eating most Asian themed food.  My son had a cheese burger which he also enjoyed. Instead of fries I opted for the brussel sprouts and was so glad I did!  Delicious!  These are not you grandma's Brussels.... these were fried beyond .... well they were still recognizable.... but amazingly good with a tangy sweet balsamic reduction.  I did steal one(or five) of my son's fries which were perfectly done.   The food was awesome  The service was great too!  I would not have tried the Gangnam with chicken if it weren't for the friendly young lady who took our order and recommended it.  I think it's really cool that they have a drive-thru too although the inside of the restaurant is great to dine.  The outside is unassuming but thin inside is nice with giant TV'a if you are interested in watching a game or something  Needless to say I would totally come back with the rest of the fam and friends whether visiting my son or in need of a tasty creative burger!",

I have never had poutine before and I really am disappointed that I have missed out on such deliciousness for so long. I have also read reviews about the macaroni and cheese so I can't wait to go back so I can try that!",

I arrived 10 minutes after the email said it would be ready and I am sitting here 20 minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready still waiting. There is no one at the counter ordering. Employees are talking with one another. No one is even looking my way. Not the way to do business.",

That's Fine and all, but that really means about a 15% price increase and the decor and layout do not suite a server type restaurant.",

I got the chili cheeseburger with brussel sprouts and my husband got the Swiss Fun-Ghi. Y'all, this may be one of the best burgers I've ever had - juicy and flavorful. And the sprouts were to die for. We'll be making the 1 hour, 20 minute drive when we want a delicious burger.",
