Would have given it 5 stars but felt like they could have given more lasagna (one layer) for the price ($13.13 not worth the money), and I got two plates with one fork smh. Not good when you and your people on the go, but mistakes happen  I will be returning back, therefore I do recommend all to come and give it a try if you don't mind paying adult prices for a kids plate.",

The drumsticks were amazing, perfectly crunchy with a great seasoning. These drumsticks are a game-changer, great for vegans and carnivores! Staff had a delightful energy and super friendly.

I ended up ordering Chik'n & Waffles with a side of Spinach. Other than baby spinach on a salad or sauteed, I don't order cooked spinach at restaurants but based on all of the positive reviews, I decided to go for it and not disappointed. Although I had read all the rave reviews about the drumsticks, I was still hesitant about eating the chik'n. I bit into it and it was actually good! The only downside to the meal is that the drumstick was waaaaay over cooked, however, I will definitely make a return visit to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "Being someone that tries to have a plant based diet as much as possible is really hard where I live in HP. However, I just happened to be in Charlotte on an errand and was starving thus prompting the Yelp search for food. Lo and behold, Veltree was .1 miles away. Walking in was an absolutely fantastic experience! I was greeted kindly, and when I told them it was my first time, the entire staff (cooks included) welcomed me with cheers. What a welcome, indeed! The energy alone would have made up for average tasting food, but the lack of indoor seating really drives home the sign outside; \"vegetarian take out.\" Out of the options of the day and after being given a free sample of cheesecake (order a piece, just do it), I went with chick'n and waffles, black eyed peas, mac and cheese, and a red velvet cupcake. After the time I spent waiting for my order, I literally was wanting to put in an application myself to work with such gracious presences. But, on to the food.  Hands down, I cannot tell you any place that I have ever eaten at that had better black eyed peas. The best are there. Order them. The red velvet cucpake was not over the top with sweetness, but was a perfect light hint of red velvet that did not feel heavy at all. That mac and cheese? Heavenly. Chick'n and waffles? Honestly, I ended up eating them separately because the waffle had its own great flavor. I am so happy to see something like this just an hour away, and will be going back.",

Loved that it was a different base than I am use to. Could have eaten like 50 nuggets  Thank you so much ladies you made my day! Loved the yams! My love got the curry stew and also enjoyed it!

First the items on the menu is broken up in days, I feel like all side items should be a daily not I have to come back in a week to try different sides. Second, every side has its own price, I know somethings are obvious to price different like if you want a extra side, but one side or two should come with each meal automatically(this would help with pricing). Lastly, Price. I paid $10.00 for chic n waffles, my waffle was huge and I receive 3 smaller than a chicken nugget size chickens. I did ask is that how many come in the order and they said \"Yes\". So I was disappointed in that. I feel if your going to serve it like that you should have a nugget for each waffle angle to even enjoy it. I only ate half of my waffle because I saw no point in eating it without chicken.  I'll come back and try another day or I'll just come back for the chicken and make everything else at home cause it's just not worth the price for each side. They didn't have nothing fresh or cleansing like fruit or cold salad, or fresh drinks.  Overall it was a nice place, great people.  May need a better prepping system so they serve more sides daily. And really, atleast 2 more chicn with waffles or cut the waffle in half and mark down the price because the ratio is off.",

It was a bit of a wait for our food, but the customer service was excellent and the food was well worth the wait. We both got the cheeseburger; I got mac & cheese for my side and my husband got the fries (I *might* have snuck a few). Absolutely delicious, and really really good vegan food. I am really excited about this place, and look forward to coming back again to try the drumsticks or the chick'n and waffles!!! A perfect new addition to the food scene in Charlotte!",

I couldn't wait to eat! We backed out of the parking space and backed up into another one so we could devour our food. The aroma was soooo relaxing. It reminds me of comfort food of course vegan comfort food there is just no other way. We will definitely be returning to Veltree this month! Thank you for the warm welcome.",

Most vegetarian food/restaurant  was either blah or blah from the frozen food section. Well! This spot, this spot right here no no this spot...this spot has flavor ! It makes no sense. I think it's some spell they cast over you. Goodness the food is good...good portions too. Listen, I'm from the North and I've always said that this region is sort of a culinary desert. Veltree is turning that idea around...with no meat mind you! I'm not kidding, you've GOT to try this food its hasnt disappointed.",

The food was amazing, I'm speechless! Delicious! The cheeseburger tasted like nothing I've ever eaten before, the flavor had me wanting more. My husband ordered the drumsticks and to his surprise they were \"very good\" the creativity & thought process they've put into making this vegan food taste so good will have you coming back for sure! I have to let you know it's take out only. They do have a dine in area but it is by reservations only from what I was told by the nice lady at the counter. Pricing is reasonable our meal was about $27 including drinks for two. I do hope they plan to expand & some point have a dine-in area. My final note & the reason I didn't give them a five. Parking wasn't ideal, we had a little trouble finding the restaurant and no place to sit and enjoy your meal. However, after experiencing the atmosphere & the food at Veltree, we'll definitely be back!!",

They run a limited menu (2-3 entrees/2-3 sides) a day so check out their website first to see what they are serving.    I had the salmon patties and they were so good....flavored so well. In fact as good as any salmon patties i have had....but not as fishy....imagine that?  My daughters both had the jerk chicken and it was also very tasty.  We all had the mac and cheese (daughter did a double order) and was equally great.  The ladies who run it are extemely friendly and offered samples before we ordered.  This is a \"to go\" place but they do have a room a few doors down in the building they are in where you can dine.",

The collards are good, but the wings were overcooked and the \"meat\" was mushy. The Mac and cheese did not have much flavor and is not better than what I can make at home.  The kicker is that I had a full night of diarrhea. Lovely. Obviously will not be back.",

Very good people. I order the cheeseburger (soy free), yams and cinnamon bun. The cheeseburger tasted just like the beyond meat burger that I get from Publix out of the freezer section. Nothing special there. The yams were pretty good. The cinnamon bun was not what I expected. I expected this warm, moist, gooey dessert. Instead I got a hard, cold, dry piece of bread with icing on top. Not very tasty. Maybe I need to try to chicken since that's what I hear most people raving about because I was not impressed with what I got. Oh and my bill was $16.00. Totally not worth it. I will give this place another try but maybe I will try something different.",

The seasoned french fries however were the worst fries I have ever eaten in my life. They were dehydrated from sitting too long and tasted like eating wood chips!! I have no idea if they served bad food just to us, because people who ordered even before us were still waiting and we got ours in less than 10 mins. Anyways, overall absolutely horrified and ideally I should have been reimbursed for my meal but I had no energy left to go back there again, just picked up fast food after throwing this whole thing out!!!! Never stepping my foot here again, these people should shamed of serving this kind of food at an overpriced rate!",

While there are a few restaurants in and near Harrisburg that offer a few vegan options, it seems that the majority of the vegan restaurants in Charlotte are southern protion of the city. So, I was pleasantly surprised to see a new vegan option that I could go to for lunch.  While the place is new to me, the location is not as I used to go to ZiZi's Vegan to Go when it occupied the space where Veltree is located.  I ordered the Chic'n n Waffles and Sweet Potato Cheezecake and because my wait was a bit long, I was offered a free cupcake (chose the red velvet).  The food was heavenly. The Chic'n had the perfect amount of seasoning. The waffle was light and fluffy. And the syrup was the best syrup I've ever had. The cheezecake was to die for. Haven't eaten the red velvet cupcake, yet as I decided to save it for dinner.  The staff at Veltree are great. They are very friendly and make you feel at home as do the fellow customers.   If you are a vegan and even if you are a non-vegan, you should definitely give Veltree a try.  As for me, I will definitely be back to Veltree!",

Lol  So, as I was reading about this spot found out they're a restaurant that changes their entrees per day. So, this day they didn't have the mac.  (lowkey: I was mad lol) But it's all good, their Kale Ginger Lemon made up for it!! That shit was sooooooo good!!!   So my manager and I get their and because we're first timers they make this warm welcome announcement that we are. It was cute, ain't come with nothing, but it was cute. Lol I chose the crab cakes, greens and sweet potatoes. All was soooo good. The crabcakes were flavorful but the consistency was different than what I'm used too. But neither here nor there, it was good! My manager got the ribs with the same sides, now those ribs were poppin!!! Next time, I will get that!!  But definitely favoriting this spot!  The service there is quick and warm. Like I say, that always makes the food better   I would add pictures to this but I was hungry and didnt even think about taking pictures till I was finished.  Blame my stomach y'all, blame my stomach lol",

    "text": "Fairly new black-owned vegan restaurant in the heart of the university area...The most perfect equation I could ask for.  Pros :  The environment is consistently welcoming & I am always given a very friendly greeting   The customer service is always superb & the staff always has a positive attitude  Restaurant is close to my home which is convenient for me   The Fried Chikn is the absolute best vegan fried chikn in Charlotte ! great with hot sauce or bbq   Cons :  Pricing. The prices are extremely to expensive. I am all for spending whatever money necessary on good vegan food, but I am always still hungry after I eat veltree. The pricing to portion ratio is off.  Portions. Sometimes they give a generous side serving amount , and other times they provide you with a serving so small you would think it was a kids portion. The portions are inconsistent.  Menu. Extremely too limited. I know they are still fairly new, but the menu needs some serious revisions and additions.  Restaurant is very warm in temperature. I wanted to cry it was so scorching hot while I waited on my food one afternoon. I was sweating bullets.  Fries. As pictured, these shriveled up, bottom of the bag, sitting under a hot lamp all day, unseasoned pieces of potato I was given, is the dealbreaker for me. I couldn't believe that the cook thought this was appropriate to serve. I can't believe the cashier checked that food and thought it was appropriate to serve. I just can't. I couldn't even walk back in to complain because it was just that terrible. I ate the Chikn and threw those fries out to the nearest dumpster I could find. That was my first time ever trying the French fries. It is also the last time that I will be at VelTree, for a while.   So the fries are what led to this review. I've wanted to review VelTree for a while now, but I wanted to give it my honest opinion. I also wanted to keep in mind that they are still a new restaurant and just them putting in the effort to provide something like this for the community is amazing! I will not give up on them, but I want them to really focus on the growth of the establishment as it seems they've gotten comfortable with how things are being ran. I am going to give them a break for a while. have really really tried to love VelTree, but the inconsistency is to common for me to continue to risk my money. I hope this insight is helpful. I will give them time to improve. I wish VelTree the best.",

Today, it was really hot as I waited for my food. It was a little busy. There's a small waiting area but no where to eat.   I ended up ordering the crab cakes sandwich as that was menu for today along with spaghetti. I also got a side of collards. I thought the cakes were actually good, good flavor but of course a different texture , as expected . The kale and collard mix was really bland. I had high expectations for those . The meal also came with two pieces of corn bread.   I really wanted to love it but it just didn't hit the mark for me. Maybe I'll come back and give something else a try .",

The Chik'n was new to me, but it wasn't bad. It came on a stick and did not lack flavor.  The yams were also good, not cooked to death.   This is restaurant is take-out only, and located in a shopping center off of North Tryon .  I highly recommend this Vegan spot .",

After today's visit, I've had to eat those words(pun intended). As i walked in i saw several people waiting for their food and was promptly greeted by the staff. They were so friendly and welcoming. After telling the cashier it was my first visit, she yelled to the other staff \"we have a first timer!\" She was able to tell me about the menu and how each day has a special, as well as the everyday specials.  I chose the two Chick'N legs,  mac and cheeze, and yams. After a short wait i got my food and headed home. That first bite of the Chick'N blew me away. This isn't meat?! It was flavored to perfection, and had a satisfying crunch to the breading. I was an instant fan. Maybe i could do this vegan thing.  The mac and cheeze and yams were delicious as well. Overall, i was very pleased with my visit and hope to be back very soon. Thank you guys for changing my views and providing excellent cuisine.",

    "text": "I'm NOT a vegan or vegetarian, but I restrict meat from my diet at times and do a Daniel's Fast a couple of times a year.  As a result, I used to come to ZiZi's or eat at Bean Vegan or even Chipotle to grab some clean, fresh meals.  I wasn't aware Zizi's was no longer until a friend of mine told me they were closed permanently.  So I hopped on Yelp and discovered Veltree!  I went to their IG and FB pages to take a look at their offerings and I was pretty impressed.  I read some great things about them and decided to give them a try as I'm currently on a Daniel Fast and I'm tired of veggie bowls from Chipotle lol.  Their menu isn't the same daily, but it isn't a bad thing- don't let it deter you from coming here.  When I arrived, I was immediately greeted by the employees with a warm welcome.  They were very patient and friendly to answer any questions I had and I placed my order with ease. I ordered the Salisbury Steak over rice, Spinach, Cornbread, and 2 Chic'n Drumsticks (peep the pics).  OMG!!!! It was all so delicious and not lacking in any flavor at all!  Even my sister had to have a few bites of it!! The Chic'N really does tastes like fried chicken!!! The spinach was fresh, not from a can and the cornbread wasn't dry at all.  The gravy and \"Salisbury steak\" was so savory and delicious, that's all I can think about right now! LOL  When I was there, there was a gentleman that ordered a little while before me and he waited a while for his order and without him even mentioning it or saying anything, the staff noticed it and immediately apologized, offering him a free dessert.  I thought that was a very nice gesture and it shows they are very attentive to their guests. Just off of that alone, I will be returning along with the delicious food I thoroughly enjoyed.  They have Sunday brunch and are closed on Mondays, but they accept ApplePay and are live on DoorDash and UberEats :)  Again, I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, but I'll definitely be back very very soon!",

I called and spoke with Tre who advised me that they were closing between 3-5 however she would take care of me really quickly. I was ecstatic and took all of her suggestions when she said jerk chicken and kale greens, I was sold.  They are tucked away in a small plaza across from the Wiki Car wash and \"if you get to Walmart you went too far. \"  The ambience of the restaurant was very nice and relaxed and made you want to pull up a seat, talk and eat (since they were closed I ate in the car, smell was too good to wait). The food is soo flavorful, not too grainy and filling. You guys have won over a long time customer.   Thanks again Tre for taking my order.  P.S. THIS COOKIE!!!!!",

    "text": "Veltree is a vegan soul food take-out restaurant over in the University area.  Let me start with a full disclaimer::: I am not a vegan in any sense of the word.  I am fully carnivorous and I think that makes this review even more significant.  My girlfriend had been wanting to try this spot so I reluctantly accompanied her, (she issued a couple threats and then dragged me there kicking and screaming).   The first thing that really caught my attention is the design.  As soon as I stepped into this spot, I immediately felt at home.  The colors are warm and inviting.  The art work is super dope.  There are pictures of the Chef with different celebrities.  I felt like I was in a comfortable living, not like I was about to get counter service.  Did I mention the super dope art work?  It's worth mentioning again.  The young man working the counter was remarkably pleasant.  He pointed out that it was obviously my first time in and he took the time to walk me through the menu.  Apparently the menu changes daily.  He then asked what types of foods I liked to eat and he made personalized recommendations.  I chose to go for the Vegan Cheese Burger and I elected to add chili and bacon to the sandwich.  Figured I may as well go all the way.  I also took the liberty of ordering Vegan Chicken and Waffles.  The concept of vegan chicken was a little beyond me.  I consider myself a bit of a chicken and waffle connoisseur, so I had to try it.  I also had a side of the most delicious yams.  I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was well cooked, well seasoned and really packed a lot of flavor.  I had absolutely no faith, but I was actually impressed.  The texture of the burger was a little different, but the flavors were on point.  The chili and bacon was a great addition.  I loved the fries as well.  I washed it all down with a delicious organic soda.  All in all it was a very enjoyable meal and my significant other will not have to drag me there the next time.  I am actually looking forward to a return visit.",

Now that lemonade, created a whole new meaning of delicious. I enjoyed the first, second and third flavor that erupted simultaneously across the curves of my tongue.

And the food, oh my! Honestly, it looked so good on my plate I couldn't even wait to get home to eat it. I ate it in my car!! I ordered the curry vegetables and rice. I also had a kale lemonade (not sure if that is the correct name). Ya'll I almost went back inside and ordered more. This is definitely a place I will visit more often. Welcome to the community Veltree. Continue to be awesome at what you do!",

They gave my son a complimentary cupcake when they found out it was his birthday!  We ordered the chic'n n waffles which we all agreed was amazing!  They are to-go only, so we took ours to the park.  If you're vegan, this place is a MUST!  If you're not vegan, give them a try!  They might just turn you!!!",

    "text": "My husband stopped eating meat several months ago so we're always looking for vegetarian options for restaurants. This place was recommended by a coworker. We popped in on a Saturday afternoon. Here's what you need to know: -food is take out -menu is traditional soul food but all plant based options, nice twist! -menu changes daily and apparently during the day, they ran out of macaroni and cheese after we ordered but we were offered another side -follow them on Instagram to keep up with the daily menu -there was about a 15 minute wait for food and the space is small but everything was hot and fresh -service was great  They asked for patience as they're still new. Definitely going back and anticipating an upgrade to 5 stars. Everything we had was good except I wasn't a fan of the cornbread. Personal choice, I need my sugar in my cornbread.",
