(the owner)....anyone who knows KC knows that he was more than likely just blustering some bullsh-t and acting like the big bad loud guy and the employees were all in on the joke, theres no one who works there who wouls yell for real in front of diners. I don't think the last poster got the joke......its really mellow there",

We sat in the tiki bar, an extra outdoor seating area (there are two). My handsome boyfriend had the Neptune Platter, which had a lightly breaded assortment of fried fish AND vegetables. I had the marinated ribeye fajitas. They were amazing! The meat was incredibly tender. The black beans were juicy and the rice well cooked. They even grilled the tortillas. I'm going back for more, but next time I'm getting the fish tacos.",

    "text": "I've been here 3 times now. The first time I ordered off the menu and got tempura shrimp tacos. They were delicious! As my side, I got the potato salad. It wasn't your ordinary potato salad; it's more of a cold german potato salad (with vinegar) - which I liked. The second time I went I ordered the lunch special, a sandwich called \"Beefona\". It was a pork tenderloin sandwich with lettuce, mayo and the awesomely delicious pickled cucumbers. Although the service that day was way too slow, once my meal came out and I got a few bites in, the sandwich helped that the service was slow. The pork was also a bit overcooked, but you know when you're hungry it sometimes just doesn't matter. Besides, it all tasted good anyway! I took the fam last night, dined al fresco and once again decided to try the special on the board. It was a noodle bowl with mushrooms and gravy. It also had carrots and celery. Even though a veggie dish (which I usually don't order), this tasted very good. I suggested that adding red pepper and green onion would have been a good addition to the dish. KC was out of red pepper that day but said it would have been in if he had it.  All in all, my experience has been a 3 for 3 on the food and a 2 for 3 on the service. (BTW, our waitress last night was so friendly and made the dinner enjoyable.)",

Our waiter forgot our appetizer, our salads (that came with our meals), brought me chicken,shrimp and tofu when I asked for just chicken, and also forgot to bring the rice that came with my meal... wow. Even with the terrible service- the food shone through. I had the red curry and it was velvety, spicy, perfection. My husband had the shrimp and grits and enjoyed it- although he said it was a little too spicy (he likes spicy foods) especially with the jalepeno cornbread on the side. Regardless of this first experience- we will be giving it another try- looking forward to some tacos next go round....",

    "text": "I was really excited about trying this place & I was using this as a night to break my diet... I should have stayed home & ate a salad. I ordered the Neptune's platter which was SUPPOSED to be fried fish, calamari & scallops. I got my plate & it had fish (which was fried in small pieces, I thought I would be getting a single piece...), calamari and shrimp... Shrimp? That wasn't even in the description. I asked our waitress where the scallops were. She asked the cook & replied, \"Oh we're out of scallops\". If I had known that I would not have ordered the dish at all, I was really looking forward to scallops! (one of my favorite foods) That is just bad business not to tell a customer they're out of something and try to replace it with something else. It's kind of like ordering a steak and getting chicken - unacceptable. Besides this mistake the food was overly fried & not very good. The dish had deep fried vegetables (frozen) as a side (deep fried broccoli?) and dry cornbread (not good) The highlight of the meal was probably the ceviche appetizer. My friend got the blackened tuna & was not impressed either (left over half of it at the restaurant) The waitress was friendly & discounted the meal but she should have been aware if they were out of something. A 2 star rating is generous... I won't be rushing back after this experience. There are too many other good restaurants in Charlotte.",

The restaurant was obviously understaffed- for example- we ordered a couple bottles of wine, the waitress brought them out after about 5 minutes, but then we had to wait another 15  minutes for her to bring glasses and open the bottles! The glasses she brought were filthy, we ended up drinking wine out of pint glasses. That would have been fine if the food had been good, but everyone food was terrible. Tofu was dry and tough, chicken was overcooked, tacos were so greasy they left a puddle on your plate. Not sure I'll be coming back here again- so disappointed.",

Our food seemed to take quite a while to get out, but at least we felt confident in its freshness. The quesadilla had a lot of meat in it. My salmon taco was very delish. I'm still amused by the combination of Chinese/Korean/Mexican. The cactus salad needed seasoning to me. My brother wasn't too impressed with the decor/cleanliness, and I have to admit, I think they put too much into decorating it and don't pay enough attention to simple sanitation. Their sanitation rating was hidden (I LOOKED for it), our silverware was filmy and overall, it really seemed to be a dive. I don't mind dives, but the concept is to APPEAR grungy, not BE grungy. I think whatever the customer comes into contact with should be CLEAN. I looked up the rating and it's a 95.5 if you're wondering.",

    "text": "I had a long debate with myself about whether I should round up or down from my TRUE rating, which is a 3.5.  There were many factors that led to the 4 stars: it's locally owned, amazing concept, and, well, the food was spectacular.    So I got the tempura shrimp tacos, and they were amazing.  I actually turned into a grandma when I bit into them and said to myself, \"Oh my, is THAT GOOD!\"  But it was!  The shells are chewy and golden, stuffed with crispy fried shrimp, amazingly flavorful coleslaw, and \"pink gold\" sauce which is very aptly named.    I ordered the squash casserole as a side, but was given the Mac and Cheese, which was totally fine; the waiter brought out the casserole too so I got both but I didn't care for it at all...the mac and cheese, however, was PHENOMENAL.  Slightly spicy, super creamy, it was like something out of a mac and cheese filled dream.  (the best kind of dream)    My only qualm was with the service.  It wasn't bad, not at all.  Our waiter was super attentive and came over many times to check on/chat with us.  Maybe...a little TOO many times.  He was a really sweet dude but it was honestly one of the most awkward experiences I've ever had in a restaurant.  Right after we got our food he walked over, stared at the table, and walked away again without saying a word, and later came over to ask us if we wanted to try the flavored water...after we had already finished our meal.  He also told us a few non-sequitur stories and then recommended a BBQ restaurant in Ballantyne without actually telling us it's name.  He was so sweet, though, so I feel kind of like a monster for saying anything, but I get extremely uncomfortable when strangers talk to me like, in the middle of the day, when I haven't been drinking.  I stammer and can't make eye contact and start to get red-faced and sweaty and it's just not a good look.  But other than that, my Krazy Fish experience was great, and I'll be back for sure.    And you should go.  They're really nice there.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to to Krazy Fish in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. We arrived a little before noon on Good Friday and waited a few minutes to be greeted and seated. The first thing we noticed was the eclectic interior combined with junk art throughout the restaurant, and the musty smell was a turn off. At the waiter's suggestion, we shared the Neptune Platter which included fried fish, shrimp, calamari, scallops, and vegetables and also served with Krazy slaw, Mac n Cheese (our choice) and cornbread. Nuoc Cham (at least, that's what we think it was?) and wasabi tartar dipping sauces were provided.  I don't believe there is any way one person could have eaten this entire meal. It was huge. The fish was tender, the calamari crispy, and the fried vegetables were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of bite, the highlight of the dish. The two negatives of this dish were the Krazy slaw and the cornbread. The slaw had an unidentifiable spice and a \"pickled\" flavor which made it almost uneatable and the cornbread was very dry. Dora here. I'm not a huge fan of seafood in general, so it takes a lot to win me over. For me, the fish was a bit too fishy, and nothing on the plate really stood out or invited me to come back. Maybe I might've liked the grilled platter more.  I would rate this establishment 3 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving good",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying the Ceviche Hard Tacos that I ordered weren't half bad. Though I'm a firm believer that hard taco shells should be reserved for late night trips to Taco Bell or for taco night at home with the kids, I applaud Krazy Fish's decision to serve its Ceviche Taco in a hard shell, since ceviche is normally eaten with tortilla chips. The taco is a good idea, but could be executed better.  The shell wasn't made fresh and might even have been store bought and reheated.  It tasted a little too done, just shy of burnt.  The civeche was basically lime marinaded white fish; good, but nothing special. It was served with a creamy avacado/cilantro-based sauce which was quite nice..but I would have preferred some fresh avocado and cilantro in the taco.   The plate cost just under $9 and came with two tacos and one side. I ordered Corn Maque Chou, which I often make at home during the summer when fresh corn is plentiful.  What I got seemed more like canned corn with some chopped green bell pepper thrown in.    I would have loved to try another taco, but I was told they don't mix and match.  The server told me I could order individual tacos for a little bit more, but considering each taco plate cost between $8 and $10, I figured $5 was too much to pay for a taco without knowing whether it was going to be any good or not.   Overall, the food was good enough that I would be willing to return and try one of the other tacos on the menu.  The Szechuan Salmon Tacos sounded interesting.    My biggest beef was with the servers.  I dropped in early on a Friday night, before the crowd arrived.  I'm pretty sure I was one of maybe 5 customers in the entire restaurant.  So all the servers were killing time before the rush.  But they were having loud conversations about drinking and being hung over and throwing up...and these weren't college kids, but adults. (I would assume by appearance, each was hovering around the late 30's or 40's) Now, Krazy Fish isn't fine dining by any stretch, but I expect employees to act professional..even in a dive.  If you are craving a fish taco in Charlotte, do yourself a favor and hit up the vastly superior Cabo Fish Taco in NoDa.",

(: Called in before ahead for a group of 7, and right when we walked in they already got our table ready! I actually love all the KRAZY decor lol! Started off with the hibiscus drink, it was slightly sweet/salty to my liking. I ordered the blackened mahi tacos & the jalapeno grits(because of all the rave), the mahi was a bit dry and the taco was wayy too overloaded. I tried the salmon taco & it was too salty & over sauced. I also had a bit of the shrimp & grits, it was good everything on it looked really fresh. Buuuut the GRITS though, LOVE! The consistency, flavor, and texture was all perfect. Our server was amazing as well! Service was phenomenal, he was attentive to all our needs & genuine. Overall I feel like whenever I'm in the mood for tacos, Cabo would be the place to hit but I will come back for the banging grits & awesome service !",

    "text": "Tried this gem tonight after long debate whether I wanted sushi or fish. Boy am I glad I chose fish! The location was decent, on Central Avenue right before it gets \"questionable\". It was Halloween night and not busy at all..which was fine with me!   When I first saw the building, I noticed the eclectic art surrounding the patio. This art continued as I entered, and was filled throughout the restaurant. It was interesting, because the art looked like it was made up of reclaimed items. Some of which included a mermaid, flamingo, and sailfish. This style wouldn't normally work in any space, but for some reason looked great here and was very inviting!  As I entered, I was greeted right away and then seated. I was given water and asked what else I would be drinking. Unfortunately, I declined since I would be drinking later since it was Halloween! I noticed the menu had a lot of great options, but nothing relatively healthy like I wanted. I was okay with this since it is a Southern style restaurant and \"heathy\" is sometimes hard to come by. I ended up getting the Southern Fried Shrimp Roti with a side of roasted potatoes. I chose this entree because I am in love with shrimp and the Jamaican curry sauce sounded amazing (yellow curry with peppers, onions, and pumpkin)!   When I received my food, I realized that my eyes were bigger than my stomach. It was so much food and didn't think I could even make a dent in it. While enjoying my meal, the waiter filled my water several times and was very attentive. I thought he did a great job at making me feel comfortable, without coming around too often. As for the food, it was absolutely amazing! it was definitely Southern style and seasoned well done. Great, but not somewhere I could eat all the time, just when I need some comfort food..which is actually far too often. I ended up eating half of my food, and got a box for the rest (I love when this happens).  As I was leaving, I saw a poster with Guy Fryer's face on it. I absolutely love his show and couldn't believe he also tried this restaurant! I wondered what he ate, and I got the idea to google it later when I got home. Story of my life!",

The potato pancakes where really unique and tasty.",

    "text": "I love me some Krazy Fish. It's on my list of places I recommend when friends want to grab a bite or folks are visiting from out of town. It's also one of my go to's for margaritas and happy hour.  I love happy hour here. Half off tacos from 4-6pm M-F = $5 for two tacos and a side!  Tacos are definitely my go to entree here with the Southern Fried Fish option at the top of my list (I usually ask for it blackened instead of fried, unless I'm feeling Southern). I've tried all the other tacos that have seafood in it and am also a fan of the Szechuan Salmon. I'm not a huge fan of the sweet sauces on some of the other tacos (chutney or fruit salsas) because I'm partial to fish tacos being as close to Baja authentic as possible, but that's a personal preference thing.   I've also tried the roti here which is tasty, but not what I was expecting. If you're thinking Indian roti or roti Canai, which I was, it's not that. It's more of a wrap/burrito with a lot of rice and curry (if you choose that). Too starchy for me.   The seafood creole is also tasty and they don't skimp on the seafood either! Fried fish, shrimp, calamari, and scallop over rice in a cajun-style marinara. With a giant chunk of cornbread plopped on the side. And a side. This one is too rich for my blood, but if you've got a hearty appetite, have at it!  In appetizer land, the shrimp curry is my fave - potato cakes and fried shrimp paired with curry is so delicious.  They have a full bar which is real nice because that's where they make their yummy margaritas. After my last class for the last degree I'm ever getting (maybe), my classmates and I went straight to Krazy Fish and drank margaritas. Lots of margaritas. It was a glorious moment. The waitress just kept bringing them!  The wait staff is always so friendly - and knowledgeable about their vast menu. Water cups are always filled, other beverages are always inquired upon, and they're always so quick to bring me sriracha (v. important).  The decor is eclectic and it's located on a random part of Central Ave, so be on the look out when you're headed there. And you should head there, because who doesn't like a flavor blast in their mouth?",

Chuckled as we pulled into the artfishly decorated parking lot and knew it was going to be a fun spot from the start.  They easily accommodated our group of 8 and the staff were so helpful and friendly, even making us feel comfortable about the new grandbaby that was with us.  So on to the food, we tried the coconut shrimp and shrimp curry appetizers, and both were tasty, though the curry was sweet as opposed to the spicy I was expecting. I got the bulgogi roti with red curry sauce and cactus salad (it was so fresh and delicious, definitely try this).  I would love to come back to try their other unique menu items.  Definitely get the bananas foster cheesecake too!  I don't even like bananas, but it was so good.  Tasted like eating banana pudding!",

I actually ate most of my husband's when he wasn't looking! The salmon tacos were crazy flavorful and the blueberry sauce for the BBQ tacos was amazing!

    "text": "I've been driving by this place for a while now, but I just haven't had the chance to try it out. So I came here with a friend and looked up their menu online and decided to give them a chance. First thing that comes to mind when I came here and saw their menu was that it was absolutely Krazy.  Krazy Fish is a Southwestern Asian Fusion restaurant, at least that's how I would describe it. What surprised me was that even the menu had Pho, which is absolutely nuts to me. I ordered their bulgogi sandwich, excited to see when it was brought out that it was hearty and full.   Sadly, even though the decorations were pretty and it was very creative inside, the food was a little bit of a let down. However, there was a nice twist on the mac and cheese as a side (I'll give you the details, it wasn't cheddar cheese they used instead it was a nice pepper jack cheese which actually gave the normal mac n cheese a punch!)   The bulgogi sandwich was a little let down I must say though. The bulgogi didn't really have that bulgogi taste I was so used to at korean restaurants, however if they did marinate it right and had that kick and sauce pouring from that sandwich it would be awesome! I think I give them a thumbs up on knowing the path to take to make that sandwich awesome, however they missed it on the flavor. The beef tasted like just beef that was cooked, no where near bulgogi flavored beef.   The Chipotle beef taco was supposed to be their version of the bulgogi taco (at least that's what they said) and it was yet again a let down. My friend and I also got the side item cactus salad, which was I don't know a little wild. It had a slimy texture and well it tasted a little exotic nonetheless. But, back to the topic of the taco. It was just beef with  chipotle sauce on top. This place is definitely a place to eat and have tacos as a side item, so I guess coming in here for lunch was a little off.  Overall, I thought it wasn't too bad. They're almost there though, with that bulgogi sandwich. I'll definitely come back here and see if they change anything before I say anything. Without a doubt I think this place is a great place to drink though, and if I don't come back for lunch at least I'll come back for tacos and drinks!",

I ended up with the fried calamari roti (burrito) with whichever was the lightest spiced curry.  I forgot to mention the cilantro thing at first and so after we ordered I remembered and got our servers attention.  He took care of it right away and my food did come out cilantro free, phew!  I also had the squash casserole and side salad because I was told the mac-n-cheese was even spicy, made with a queso sauce.  Sides were okay, I did try my sistersmac and while yes it did have a kick, I found it pretty tolerable and very yummy!  Brownie in an orange was weird and the orange flavor on everything was a bit much for me.  But it wasn't bad.

    "text": "My birthday is in September. September 6th, to be exact. I've been hunting around for a great place to have it, and so far, this is at the top of my list. In fact, Krazy Fish is at the top of my list in North Carolina for:  1.) Best Tacos I've Ever Had 2.) Most Unique Atmosphere 3.) Most Friendly/Laid-Back Staff 4.) Best Food Fo'Yo'Moneh   FOOD: I'm serious about the tacos, dude. Had them tempura-calamari-wise, and tempura-shrimp-wise. Seriously deliciouso. Not just good seafood, but the tacos come with their krazy slaw, and while I'm not sure exactly what's in it, I assure you it is tangy and delicious. Also, you get you choice of unique sauces to top your tacos. So far, everything I've tried is amazing, though my favorite is the Pink Gold sauce. One of the best things is actually the taco shell... soft, flour or corn tortillas that are fried until they're all puffy and crispy and flavorful and delicious... the entire thing truly is a symphony in your mouth.  SERVICE: Seriously great. Very laid back, and when I leave, I feel like I've made friends. KC is loud and hilarious, sitting down with you and telling you about future plans for the restaurant, and future concoctions. I can't wait to go back to try his shrimp cocktail gazpacho.   ATMOSPHERE: Krazy. No seriously, I have no idea how they made the little decorations for that place or why, but somehow it works. Apparently there are also plans for the patio out front, and it's still under construction. If they put in some corn hole/ping pong/whatever, they'd complete a gold mine. Hopefully those plans are already in the works.  PRICE: One'o my favorite things about this place... seriously great pricing. Two culinary exquisite and heaping tacos with a generous side for under $8? Sick, dude.   I highly recommend this place. Catch me there in the future for my tentative yelpy birthday, unless I find someplace better (but I really doubt I will!)",

    "text": "Krazy Fish is a very interesting place.  When you drive up the outside kind of looks like a dive bar, with an outdoor patio and the krazy fish sign prompting you to get \"krazy.\"  It kind of looks like a strange garage sale inside.  Then the menu comes and you are astounded by the unique mish mash of items that are just as strange as the place.  Basically, Krazy Fish lives up to its name - everything from the locale, the building, interior, menu and staff is kind of crazy.  The fun part about crazy is it isn't boring, and the food here was the most exciting I have had in awhile.  Most items on the menu have strange fruity/spicy sauce concoctions.  Scanning through the offerings I noticed a lot of seafood options, vegetarian, asian, BBQ.  All over the place!  They were offering a restaurant week special the night we were there.  4 courses for 2 PEOPLE for $30.  Given the amount of food we got that was a phenomenal deal.  Started with the ceviche with tortilla chips.  It was amazing and I was full after that.  BUT there was more.  Amazing Korean BBQ tacos with a side of beans.  Very tender huge plate of ribs with a blueberry habanero (I think) sauce, potato salad and some flavorful green beans.  Finished off the meal with a bananas foster that was surrounded by Nilla Wafers.  Wow.  I could not get any more satiated.  The owner or manager came by a couple of times and was very friendly - you could tell both he and the waiter were excited to see us and enthusiastic about their food.  It was a Monday night and was pretty sparse in terms of patrons, so we got some nice personalized service and two handshakes on the way out.  A place the adventurous, or moderately adventurous should definitely try!",

My wife got the fish fry and with four of us at the table none of us thought the broccoli casserole they brought as a side even was identifiable as such.  Her mac & cheese side tasted like it came straight out of a Kraft box (Kraft is better).  Our queso appetizer was unimpressive as well as my shrimp & grits.  We could not complain about the service thou.  We had a cute & bubbly teenage waitress who very friendly and stopped by often to ask if everything was OK.  The food quality just was not there.",

We decided not to go that route and ordered crab cakes as an app, shrimp and grits as an entree and szechuan salmon tacos for entree.  All good as usual. Service was great and friendly.  Krazy Fish is a hidden gem- great food, great prices and an interesting environment that is definitely not too sterile or bland!",

I am a big fan of the fried chicken tacos with pink gold sauce (if they even have that variety anymore). I've had their chicken bolillos but that could've quite possibly been pulled from the menu and if so I won't be missing it. The beans are great and I always get that as a side. This place has a great atmosphere and the people are very friendly. There decor is sort of kitchy meets junkyard and this is one place where it's easy to strike up a conversation at the bar. The half priced taco deal is not bad from 4-6. The drinks are pretty good.",

No one greeted us when we walked in, even though there were two employees right in front of on the computer both looking down. Then they both walked away and another person came up and told us it is going to be a 15-20 minute wait, then walked away. We were seated outside, no one asked us if we wanted to be seated inside or outside,but we sat down. NO ONE ever came to our table. We were seated in a corner then the table next to us was seated about 15 minutes after we were. A server came to their table and got them waters. Then another server came and started taking their order. Still no one has come to even greet us. I went inside to ask why no one has come to talk to us and I was told he was coming. It was busy in there but there were at least 8 servers for a restaurant that is by no means large. It was not more than servers who know how to do their jobs could handle. No one came to talk to us, so we left. The food on the menu looked good but we will NEVER return to check it out.",

A lot of people forget about good old Krazy Fish and when I drag them over there we always get the same reaction, \"I always forget about this place\"! Also don't think they just have fish they have one of the largest selections of tacos out there from tofu, to BBQ, and of course some great seafood ones. One of the last reasonable price places in this area which is an extra bonus. We went to their brunch for the first time and have to say they have a solid selection of choices we got the huevos rancheros and the biscuits and gravy which were both good and they have $4 mimosas, bellinis, and bloody Mary's on Sunday's which if you are there after noon you should totally get.",

Ambiance is extremely casual (I'm talking t-shirt and shorts) with fish themed figurines hanging from the ceiling with wooden booths for seating.  Happy hour is not an option on the weekend, but the prices are still cheap at $4 a taco that it's not a necessity. You can mix and match as well if you're not feeling two of the same. We enjoyed the salmon, southern fish, popcorn shrimp, and the blackened mahi pictured below. Would reorder the shrimp and the salmon, the fish and mahi was average and didn't \"wow\" us.   Calamari was a served in a generous portion as well paired with a more mild yet tasty marinara sauce. We accompanied our meal with the house margaritas at only $6, which makes it an easy decision.  Overall, would be back for a casual, cheap yummy dinner with some fresh tacos, chill vibe, and affordable drinks.",

I ordered the seafood creole, a rather large portion which I am not complaning about.  However, it saddens me that this dish disappointed me.   I was super excited to try it, again, due to the pictures online.   Definitely better then the Shrimp and grits, but even still lacking True flavor.

We ordered a couple of bottles instead.   We ordered the mussels and potato cakes for an appetizer, both were awesome. We also ordered the southern fried fish tacos and the Buffalo shrimp tacos. The buffalo shrimp was flavorful but the shrimp were slimy. The southern fried fish tacos had very little flavor. We requested a sauce to go with it--the lime tartar sauce and that really helped. Lastly, we ordered the fried cheesecake which was good.  Overall, the food was good with the exception of the tacos. Between feeling slimy and having no taste we were pretty disappointed.

As for mine, fried pallack &mac n cheese, I was very unimpressed.  The fish was  greasy and \"airy\" so it fell apart, necessitating me to use my fingers.  The cornbread should have been called \"dirty bread\" as it had extra seasoning (breadcrumbs or poppy seeds) sprinkled on top.  The mac n cheese tasted like it was smoked. Im a very simple eater and went with what I would consider a safe basic choice.  I probably wont go back, but my husband enjoyed his meal(s)!",

    "text": "Confession - watching the episode of Diners Drive-Ins and Dives that features Krazy Fish has been on my to do list since our first visit. Also trying their tacos but I just haven't gotten around to either yet.   Why do I love it here?   First - it is so kitschy and I adore it. I naturally find my eyes wander to take everything in when we visit. I feel like every time there is a new surprise based on a different seat. Floating mermaid? Blowfish? Check. Of all the places I have visited in Charlotte I would safely say this has the most unique decor.   Second - the service. We have always had the most friendly wait staff. Last time I was eagerly and hungrily watching as our waiter went by with everyone else's food. He eventually stopped off to let me know our food was next (in a joking good humored way) and took the opportunity to see if we wanted more drinks. Even though we don't go often since it is on the other side of town it just has this amazing neighborhood feel to it.  Third - maybe the most important. The food. Is. Amazing. Everything we have tried has been delicious. If you order one of their entrees it will quite possibly be more food than you can eat in one sitting. I can attest to never actually finishing a meal there, which means leftovers and I can enjoy it twice! Except the one time we were going out afterward and I had to leave behind such delicious food and my heart broke a little.   Fourth - the price. It can be super affordable if you go for a roti with a side which comes to $8 on average. My favorite dish, the seafood diablo, is pricy at $17 BUT comes with more seafood than you would expect. Sure there is a good portion of generic white fish in it but it is also chock full of lobster and mini scallops. Oh and it comes with a ginormous salad to start. So as far as getting a bang for your buck I would say even the entrees are a good deal.  Honorable mentions - the Thai green curry mussels are a must try if that's your thing. Huge appetizer portion with tons of bread! The cheesy jalapeno girts - my boyfriend doesn't like grits but went with the waiter's recommendation to get them as a side. He now absolutely gushes about the grits there.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have eaten at Krazy Fish before.  Our first time to eat there was okay - not great, but it also wasn't bad.  For our second trip, we went after the first two places we were wanting to eat at had long lines.  The waitress dropped us off at our table, and then waited a few minutes to take our drink order (not exactly great).  When she came back over, we ordered the salsa trio and queso for an appetizer.  My boyfriend ordered the fried shrimp po' boy, and I ordered a fried chicken roti with the Indian curry sauce.  We both ordered macaroni and cheese as our sides.  The salsa trio was good - the verde and more \"regular\" salsa (can't remember the name) were great, the pineapple one was pretty good, but the queso was a little too sweet for my liking.    When we received our entrees, my boyfriend immediately removed the tomato from the sandwich.  Tomatoes are out of season, and more often than not, they don't taste great at this time of the year.  My roti was good - however, there was too much rice.  So, I ended up picking the chicken out of the wrap.    Unfortunately, the macaroni and cheese was something you would find in the deli section of a cheap grocery store - the grease was separating from the sauce.  That is not something I want to see when eating.  Near the end of my boyfriend's po' boy, the breading had separated from one of the shrimp, and he realized that they didn't de-vein the shrimp.  So, he immediately stopped eating and placed the napkin on the plate.  He also mentioned that he could not taste the remoulade sauce at all.  The waitress did not stop by once to ask how our meal was, and she never came to bring us our check.  I waited ten minutes (mind you, it was FREEZING inside the restaurant) before I got up to walk back to where she was (back by the kitchen/bar area) to hand her the card and ask for the check.  She told me to \"hold on one minute.\" I went back to the table, where we waited for a couple of minutes for her to return.  She never checked on the couple who were eating beside us, either.  Furthermore, she had come back to the table behind ours not once but TWICE and still didn't check on us.",

Who says you have to wait until Thursday night to start your weekend?  The thing about Taco Tuesday, is well, they have half priced bottles of wine.  Every day is taco day, as the tacos are 1/2 priced 4-6 p.m.    We split the potato cakes as an appetizer.  Delish.  I loved the Jamaican yellow curry sauce it came with.  I ordered the tuna tacos with pineapple salsa and devoured every last bite.  The tuna tasted so fresh and was really complemented by the pineapple.  Oh and the best part? The flash fried taco shell.  Totally worth it. Minus one star for the swarm of flies we somehow attracted to the outdoor patio. Shower much?  Next time, I will be trying the pulled pork tacos with blueberry tamarind chutney.  Love the creativity of the menu! Great service, funky-fresh atmosphere, oh yeah, and two bottles of wine, an appetizer, and a meal for $13.  I've spent more than that at a Chick fil A!",

Server was quick to tend to our drinks and was very knowledgeable of the menu and was even able to talk us into the shrimp pimento cheese app.  The appetizer arrived in no lie about 60 seconds later and it was awesome! It arrived in a family size lasagna tray and the flavor was out of this world, one of the best pimento cheeses I have ever had.   For dinner the wife got the fried shrimp platter which she said was pretty good I tasted a few and thought they were pretty good as well.  When I ordered I was torn between the roti or the tacos, server talked me into tacos so I got the bulgogi tacos which were as well sooooo good.  The flavor was great and portion size was good for price.  For my side I took the multiple suggestions and went for the cheddar jalapeno grits.  Now I don't even particularly like grits but these were off the charts good.   All in all everything was so good and service was great, and even though food was delivered so quickly it might seem to have been microwave cooked it tasted way to good and noticeably fresh.  I have no complaints and there were many other items on the menu I need to venture back to try so I will be seeing you again soon Krazy Fish!",

But my girlfriend did some snooping while I was here in Charlotte for my business trip.  I have crazy greedy eyes so my mind told me to get 2 tacos. My stomach told me to stop after one plate, cause I was already full. Mind over body, and thus, of course, I had another taco.   Got their Tuna Taco priced at $9.95 and the fried shrimp one at $7.95 (then you divide that by 2). The food here is good. Yes, get the Tuna Taco, but NOT the Fried Shrimp (highly disappointed). But the highlight are the sauces; they are what makes the tacos in my opinion.   I had three of their different salsas: Salsa De Arbol, Pink Gold Salsa and Blueberry Tamarind Chutney. Pink Gold Salsa is a MUST! Ask your server to change it from anything that you would have with that. You won't be disappointed.  For 2 orders of tacos and a bottle of beer, meal came out to $14 with tip and tax. CHEAP!",

Then we ordered the mahi fish tacos and the pulled pork tacos, both were great and right on point. The service was wonderful. No matter what our experience the staff is always great. I really applaud them for the changes they have made and we will for sure be back. Thank you Krazy Fish!",

    "text": "I should start by mentioning that I choose my friends based on a mutual love of food. Don't judge me - you know you do it too. My high school friend and her husband take me to Krazy Fish every time I'm in town and for good reason. The food is consistently delicious! It must always be summer when I visit because we always sit on the patio and enjoy a few drinks with our tacos. This past weekend my friend and I shared the grilled shrimp roti (an off-menu item! my waitstaff probably hate it but I love ordering off-menu) with a side of mac and cheese and the Szechuan salmon tacos with a side of jalapeno cheddar grits souffle. I actually think I blacked out from happiness because the next thing I knew my plate was empty and my stomach hurt from being so stuffed. Maybe that was the margarita, but since I'm not sure I'll just have to go back for more. Whatever needs to be done for a well-informed Yelp review!",

My favorite is the grits, best grits in town as far as I am concerned.  The atmosphere is really cool as well.  It's so laid back and chill.  Great place to have a beer eat some great food and just relax.    I think the servers are great too.  Both times I have been to Krazy Fish I have had the same server and he was quick and gave great service.",

There's random stuff everywhere on the patio. It's like Cracker Barrel and a high school welding class had a love child and painted it with bright colors.   Food is delicious, though. I finally was able to try the lemongrass tofu tacos, which had been previously recommended...but on my first visit were sold out. So good. A little on the chewier side than I'm used to when it comes to tofu, but the lemongrass flavor paired really well with the blueberry salsa/sauce.  And the jalapeno cheese grits were, while not necessarily the most perfect complement, a True force to be reckoned with. So, so good. They put most other cheese grits to shame. the jalapeno kick is a swell addition.  Siracha on the table, which makes the Mr happy. He indulged in the buffalo shrimp tacos, which hit the spot. I sampled a taste of the buffalo sauce and was pleased with the flavor.  Overall, a solid choice. I'll definitely come back...and bring some friends who need to see the Krazy side of the QC!",

    "text": "Krazy Fish is krazy awesome!  Sorry, I've been dying to say that for DAYS.  Anyway, the first thing you notice as you pull up outside is the tacky decor on the outside.  It kind of looks like someone nabbed a ton of metal lawn decorations and decided to display them proudly outside.  The moment I walked inside, it was even more prominent.  The hanging plastic mermaid was definitely foreshadowed that I would love this krazy place.  The first night, I ordered the krazy grill with chicken, the cactus salad, and the jalapeno grits souffle.  My partner ordered the seafood creole.  Both of them were SUPER fantastic!!  The seafood tasted pretty fresh, and it was very reasonably priced for the quality of the food.  The sauces on both were mild-to-medium spicy, definitely a great balance.  The only thing that was just ok was the cornbread, which may have been because it was later on a Sunday night.  My second visit I ordered the calamari tacos, which came with a mango salsa on top.  Again I had the amazing grits souffle (even better on the second visit!).  OMG, this was also quite delicious.  My friend had the regular fried fish, which wasn't as good as we'd hoped it would be (but still pretty good).    This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  I can't wait to try everything on their menu!  If you like seafood and you want to try foods with Asian and Hispanic flair, I highly recommend this place.",

That being said, anything and everything I've gotten on the menu has been out of this world.  It's imaginative and fun. Very well-thought out and insanely delicious. I always get the grill mix which includes the smoked meat and chicken (though you can pick your own meat combos).   One of the best things though is the price. That's right. It's cheap. Less than you'd spend on a manufactured and plastic tasting meal at Applebees and the like. There are always great specials AND if that weren't enough; at the bottom of your receipts are discounts that you can collect to take off the price of your next meal.   An all around win great for family time, friend time or date time. Even with the obscure fish sculptures staring at you.",

First thing I'd like to point out is the service - which was outstanding! Our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to ordering since we told her it was our first time there. We started off with the Szechuan Salt & Pepper Jumbo Wings and these were our favorite part of the meal and set really high standards.  I ordered the fish fry with a side of jalapeno cheddar cheese grits souffle, cornbread,  and mac-n-cheese. My wife got the Krazy burger. In the fish fry plate flavors were hit and miss - the fish was well cooked and seasoned although I was expecting a little more crunch. The Krazy slaw didn't do anything for me, I tasted a lot of cumin and it didn't provide that refreshing and sometimes even creamy feel I expected. The grits were creamy and were spot-on with the flavor. The Mac and cheese was a complete miss for me - I barely touched it. It lacked the flavor and \"homey\" goodness I was expecting. The cornbread as ok, a little too dry to be honest.  I will definitely come back and give other menu items a try. Future reviews will follow.",

If I'm sick off only fried food, I cant imagine how their fish would settle. I'm honestly just giving them two stars so my review will be taken seriously and not make it seem like I'm disgruntled.

On Sunday August 9, 2015, my companion and I went to have dinner at Krazy Fish. We initially ordered drinks and an appetizer. I began ordering an entree and my companion asked the waiter if he could order 2 different tacos instead of 2 of the same all listed under the daily specials, as he had done numerous times in the past. The waiter explained he would have to ask the kitchen manager because he was unsure about it. While waiting, my companion saw the acting assistant manager, Bonnie, come into the dining room, and asked her to come over to the table. From across the dining room, with other customers present, Bonnie rudely yelled, \"No, don't even bother asking! I'm not doing it. If we start doing that for everybody it would be a fuc***g headache for the kitchen, so we're not doing it for you.\" The owner, Giorgio, was not present, nor was the manager Venus. Venus, unlike Bonnie, was always polite, professional, and quite accommodating whenever possible. If there was something the staff or kitchen could not accommodate concerning our order, Venus professionally came to the table and explained why and sometimes offered alternatives when available .   After Bonnie's very unprofessional and rude antics of yelling across the dining room, terrible customer service, and use of profanity, we canceled our appetizer order, paid for our drinks, and left without any objection or retort. We went to Cabo Fish Taco in NODA. There was a short wait but we were promptly texted when our table was ready. The place had a big crowd. Service was prompt, professional and courteous, and the food was great.",

So here's the thing, I took a bite literally it tasted like the dish prepared in was not properly cleaned and reused. And it tasted like it was cooked in used material. I paid $44 for some food I never ate. DO NOT WASTE your time especially NOT YOUR MONEY! I am sad to say that a local decent spot has let fame got to their heads and forgot how to treat a customer. I will not be returning and lost money over terrible food. Bad Policy. Bad SERVICE! The waiter I must say tried. It was management that didn't see the value in a customer just in money.",

The kids enjoyed their dishes, which is always a plus They even given military discounts #Winning  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because it took a little long before we received service while other tables that came in after us were getting service ahead of us. Secondly, I ordered the blackened catfish, which was just a little salty for my taste; however, I don't cook w/ salt, so it might've been fine for someone else. I didn't return my food or anything. I got a doggy bag and will try it again for lunch tomorrow. Other then that, I'll definitely return and try other things on the menu like the fish tacos.",

The mimosa was may really well.  Like I stated before I've been coming here for years but something was all the atmosphere has changed I did not feel as though our waiter was that friendly or or attentive to us I was eager to Harry up and eat and leave because I just did not feel welcomed.  I just did not get a good vibe.  This stretch of central Avenue has tons of restaurants to choose from so I'm going to put this one back on the back burner and try some other places in this area",

She was super friendly and clearly skilled at her job. God knows I couldn't serve 8 tables at a time including one with more than 6 people. However, as a customer I don't want to have to flag down staff or wait forever to be waited on. Again, she was fabulous the problem was just the ratio of tables to staff.   I've eaten here several times and typically love the food, but this past time the tacos were definitely too oily. There was liquid all over the plate which made the tacos soggy and unappetizing. I will definitely be back based on previous positive experiences, but maybe management should rethink the staffing for lunch time.",

    "text": "I thought this place would be a lot better. I knew it would be kitschy, but I thought the menu looked good, and I figured it was more upscale than the trashy mediocre diner food that it actually was.   If you read the reviews, there's a common theme that the service is usually bad. This was True. It wasn't AWFUL service because our waitress was reasonably pleasant and friendly, but she was inattentive and forgetful. My wife's ceviche tacos didn't have guacamole like they were supposed to, she wasn't asked which type of salsa she wanted, and she never got the gumbo she ordered. Ever. And the waitress was so hit and miss with service, my wife didn't really have a chance to ask for the gumbo again.   The food itself was bland and forgettable. We started with the salsa/queso trio. The chips were a little stale, and the salsas weren't flavorful. The queso was decent (although if you're looking for True Texas-style queso, walk on). Then I ordered the beef bulgogi roti. Why are rotis being served at a seafood fusion place? Who cares! Why not? The beef was more like meat loaf than bulgogi, the rice was NOT SALTED AT ALL, and the habanero apple butter sauce wasn't even spicy. I ate half, which was more than enough. No flavor whatsoever. I got mac and cheese as my side. It tasted like sadness, and it had a lovely clump of burned cheese on top to really class the dish up. It also came with a tiny little salad...which was spring mix and tomatoes. No dressing of any kind.   The drinks can be all over the place. The jalapeno margarita was a hit, the sweet tea vodka was mediocre, and the berry thing (it's like vodka and agua fresca) was saccharine sweet and not drinkable.   Skip this one. If you want GOOD diner food with better service, go for The Diamond. If you want good seafood, go literally anywhere else.",

Oh, well.  I was handed off to someone else to pay the tab, and then magically my waiter reappeared, all happy to see me.  He wasn't so giggly, however, with the 10% tip which he barely earned.  Not even a wave goodbye, either.  The menu is interesting and eclectic which sometimes suggest flavors muddle.  My blackened tuna was cooked to order, but it didn't keep inviting my taste buds back to the party.  I cleaned the plate only because I was famished.  I would've ordered more . . . well,  you know the story.  I'm tempted to try KF again but with Cabo a short trip to NoDa, not sure I'll make the effort.",

I loved the heat in these... if you can't take spicy food, you might want to skip these.  I LOVE spicy food and these were perfect.  Next I got the szechwan salmon tacos with a side of veggies.  The sesame and flavors inside were perfect. A large quantity of salmon was inside the tacos... which are in a bread a bit thicker than a tortilla.  My boyfriend got the pulled pork roti with a side of roasted potatoes.  It reminded me of a pot pie inside a wrap.  It was huge and very good.  All the food was soooo good.  I must have told my boyfriend 3x later that night how good that meal was and how much I enjoyed it. I will definately be back.  Bring a sweater though, the place tends to be cold... even in summer.",

The manager came over to address our concerns, well actually to tell us that they do not absorb any customer dissatisfaction with their food. She took the entire plate and walked away without even an apology. We paid the bill and left quietly. The  MENU does state that the establishment does not replace meals if the patron is not satisfied. So basically the patron has to be responsible for any shortcomings that come out of their kitchen. I personally don't think this is fair but this policy is disclosed on  their laminated menu's. Our server was great.",

The decor is super eclectic and you may wonder if some crazy person or a 5 year old designed it but it's character, unique character if you ask me. I've only been here for brunch and it kind of serves as my go to quick and safe brunch spot when I'm in CLT. The foods always on point, they have some cool varieties. Best part though, every brunch menu item comes with a free coffee or mimosa! The steak and eggs are my go to item because the steak has a nice flavoring to it and cooked to a nice tenderness. I'd also recommend their Chilaquiles with some extra hot sauce. If you're in the Plaza Midwood area I'd definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking to try something off the beaten path.",

    "text": "So I've been patronizing Krazy Fish since they opened. I love this place and the food makes me so happy. The food gets 5 stars. The last two times I stepped into the building, I had, by far, the worst service I've ever gotten. It was lunch, during the week both times and I believe there was only one server working. The first time, I brought a couple of friends with me. one who had been there before and one who hadn't. The server rolled his eyes and sucked his teeth so many times, I asked my friends if they just wanted to go somewhere else. I had to apologize for this establishment's treatment of her. Let that settle. He then transferred our table with no notice, but that was ok given the attitude we'd received. The story there is longer but, y'all get the idea. The second time was actually this past Thursday. I again joined a friend for lunch. The server walked to the door, saw us getting out of the car and rolled his eyes once again. He then motioned for us to sit wherever, or maybe he spoke really low. He then put water on the table as he passed by to attend to another table, mumbling something else under his breath. My friend then said \"I had him the last time I was here and he was super nasty to me. Do you want to just go to the Diamond?\" And that's exactly what we did.  I LOVE Krazy Fish, but I'm not going to patronize a place that treats me like crap every time I walk through the door. I hope something changes.",

I'm not sure what I expected but I think it was greatness based on the pictures submitted by other reviewers and the eclectic exterior of the restaurant.   When we arrived we were kinda greeted by some guy and through a combination of body language, nonverbal cues, and common sense we arrived at a table. Our waiter was nice but very uninformed about the menu offerings and though we explained it was our first time here an needed a moment to review the menu, he proceeded to read almost the entirety of it to us. Ver. Batim.   We ordered the seafood dip with toast points as it was one of the specials and we both ordered the Cuban Chicken Roti one with the Jamaican Curry Sauce and the other with Indian Curry Sauce. The sides we selected were the Broccoli medley and some kind of Corn concoction with a fancy name.   The dip came out quickly but I was surprised that it was cold. I would've liked to have known that was how it's intended but it was decent for cold seafood dip. There was some long piece of white meat or something that could've been squid or???? The point is that when we asked what was in the dip before ordering he definitely didn't indicate something that should look like that.   The Roti was flavorful except both tasted exactly the same. When we inquired about this the waiter, after \"going to inform the cooks about it,\" literally said \"um the Jamaican Curry is Indian Curry with curry in it.\"  IM SORRY WHAT???? The Broccoli, cabbage, and carrot situation was way overcooked as in almost brownish-grey and very peppery. The Corn was good.   Overall it was just \"ok\" and a strong maybe on returning but I just wasn't that impressed.",

    "text": "Gawdammit. Having worked in endless kitchens, I know how things can get all mis-sorted. The strangest thing I ever found in my food were STAPLES at a curry place my friends and I have religiously eaten at in Brick Lane, London. Anyway. It's happened to us all before: HAIR IN YOUR FOOD.  My friend had one of these Living Social coupons to this \"eclectic\", kitsy restaurant in Plaza Midwood, Krazy Fish. Place looked cozy, run by young, hip twentysomethingyrolds. Glanced in the kitchen, couldn't help notice the very earthy chef vibe, bit like at Common Market. Fair enough. Ordered a glass of white wine, and a special on the menu, Blackened Tuna tacos. I was actually pretty excited, until I got my food.  Lo and behold, a hair! Tucked just on the side of a taco-- it looked flung from a greasy dread, or something. My friend noticed it, but since it was on her bill, I didn't want to make a fuss. I know it's the price you pay at these southern, homey places-- but it pretty much ruined my entire experience and I doubt I'll ever go back.  Reminded me of an Applebee's I stopped over at in Richmond, and found a pubic-looking wrangle of a strand in my Carbonara. Trying not to vomit, I complained and all they offered me was 50% off and to remake my food. I was livid!! Why would I want to eat the same thing from your kitchen when my appetite's already been spoiled.  Blecch.  Rankings      # of times dined here: 1st     Cost of Bill incl.

Although the place was quite quiet during lunch yesterday, a few friends and I enjoyed a tasty meal.   Our server was most excellent - a mash up of tattoos & Southern charm - with many honeys, sweeties, and dolls thrown about. I fully appreciate when the server gives solid suggestions, too! We started out by splitting an order of the ceviche - a magnanimous portion of fresh, lime laden fish with plenty of onion, tomato and cilantro to amp up the flavor. The portion was generous and the taste was right on. Plus, our fab server brought out a bottle of guacamole so we could douse to our liking.   For my meal, I chose the blackened tuna tacos with pineapple salsa/slaw and a side of jalapeno cheddar grits. Two large tacos arrived with plenty of tuna and mounds of tasty pineapple slaw stuffed into fried soft shell tortillas. Let me tell you - I love me a fried tortilla. Taste-ay. The combo of the pineapple and tuna was bright and the grits, albeit a bit heavy, had great flavor and texture. I would have been totally game if they were a bit spicier, too.   I like this kinda crazy, Krazy Fish.",

And having foodie friends, we tend to share, and the pork roti didn't disappoint either.

    "text": "Before anyone starts snapping his/her fingers, twisting his/her neck and saying 'oh NO she didn't!!\", hear me out on my reasoning behind my 3-stars.  This is a prime example how expectation can ruin just about anything.  After seeing all the rave reviews, I dragged my fellow Yelper friend to try out Krazy Fish for dinner on Friday, waiting for my socks to get knocked off.  Instead I was left slightly disappointed.  Stepped through the door of this dumpy looking structure and we found ourselves in some sort of Alice in Wonderland-ville.  The eclectic decor is cute.  The place was busy, so we waited a little for the hostess.  By the door was a big blackboard with their specials on it, so my friend already knew what she wanted for dinner before we even got our table. We got seated at one of those tiny 2-top (why such small tables even exist in any restaurant? After salt & pepper there's barely room for water let alone my plate).  i was pleased to find out about the $2 domestic (Icehouse) special, SCORE!    The menu was simple enough and just as expected.  I decided on the Cuban Chickent Roti (aka burrito) with Jamaican Curry sauce and squash casserole as my side. My friend ordered the Thai Red Curry with Fried Fish special.  Here comes the \"fun\" part.  The waiter guy (he looked 12, I didn't think child labor is allowed) came back 3 times trying to get her order right.  Somehow \"the curry special\" as we were pointing to the blackboard only warranted a lost/deer-in-the-headlights look from him.  He had to walk to the blackboard and stare at it in order to know there are specials in the restaurant he's working at.  Yike!  My burrito looked good when arrived.  I like that they pressed it on the grill so it's a little brown & crispy on the outside.  My friend's Thai Curry Fish, on the other hand, looked odd, nothing like curry or fish.  Oh wait, I know why!  Because it indeed WASN'T Thai Curry Fish, it was shrimp gazpacho, the only other special listed on the board.  Now, how on the freaking earth after 3 repeated clarifications, curry fish became shrimp gazpacho will forever remain a mystery to me.    I nibbled on my side salad as they scrambled to fix her order.  I have to say, it was some good berry salad dressing, not tart like most vinaigrette, very summer friendly.  Then I started to poke at my squash casserole, which wasn't too heavy or cheesy, another good one.  Finally her food arrived and I dived into my burrito.  Lots of rice, not enough chicken or sauce.  It became kinda bland.  Honestly I couldn't even taste the \"cuban,\" for all I know my chicken could be Costa Rican.  I ended up spooning my friend's curry sauce, which was deliciously coconut-ty, over my burrito. I would have lick her plate clean if I could.    The food overall was fine but nothing too memorable. But the service was just mind-boggling.  I know the place is new, but the waiter doesn't know his daily specials? Now that is KRAZY (pun intended). And oh, he forgot her side salad too.  So, 3-stars for now, and I will return and try the Tempura Shrimp Tacos and see if it can earn an extra star.",

Chef salad had so many ingredients, every bite was an adventure.  Our waiter made suggestions and offered up the specials in such a way no one at our table could make a decision!  That's a good thing!  Pros: Awesome variety of food Love da music Wait staff was johnnie on the spot  Cons Room temperature glasses for beer Room temperature red wine  Several items on menu not available - one being Dijon vinaigrette - hello - how much effort does it take to whip that up - also out of scallops but that is understandable  Would definitely come back and partake of the deck and another cold one - just hope they have chilled mugs next time",

Despite some of the mixed reviews and seeing pictures of the crazy decor, I talked my party of 4 into making the trek to Krazy Fish. And it was SO worth it. (at least that's what 3 of us thought...the guy who only eats at chain restaurants wasn't all that impressed)   I had the \"special\" pineapple margarita to wet my whistle. It was pretty good, but a little sweet for my liking. The tabled ordered the potato cakes and cheese and salsa to share. I can't put into words how good the potato cakes were. We had to fight over them and every drop of sauce on the plate. I was expecting typical fried southern potatoes but these had an Asian zing. The pineapple salsa was really quite amazing, too.   I have a big appetite so I started off with a salad, too. I'd never had a salad with black eyed peas and jalapenos, but it was really, really good.   For my meal I got the lemongrass tofu tacos. I consider myself to be a bit of a vegetarian taco aficionado since I eat vegetarian tacos any time I can find them and these were SO good! But even better were the jalapeno grits that came as my side. I'd never had grits before because, well, they seemed gritty and boring (or have meat in them) but these grits were nothing short of incredible. 3 of us got them, and we could have licked our bowls.   I heard from my coworkers that she she-crab soup was really good and the Salmon tacos one of them had are still being talked about days later.   If you're not put off by crazy decor and eating food items that seem like they might not go together (but actually do!) give this place a shot!",

While the interior decor looks a bit like a performance art version of the mind of an unbalanced person with an aquatic fixation, the food is delicious. Get the tacos. Let me say that again good and slow so you wont miss it.  GET. THE. TACOS.  I've tried both the tempura shrimp and cuban chicken versions and both were delicious (though I'm partial to the shrimp, with a touch of the pepper oil that is on the tables). Neither was particularly spicy but the flavors were full and bright. I love that their slaw (which tops your protein) is not a mayo-y mess and the tortillas are fresh and fluffy. Tacos come with one side (all this for under $8). I am in love with their jalapeno cheddar grits souffle, to a ridiculous degree, but Jake's mac and cheese put up a strong argument and I look forward to measuring their squash casserole against Dish's.  Yes, they serve other things besides tacos. There is shrimp and grits that is certainly on my to do list. There is pad thai. There is curry lemongrass tofu for the veggie crowd. They will even serve you up a quarter chicken, and I look forward to trying any or all of these dishes. But in the mean time (and who am I kidding, it will only be a matter of days before I stroll back) I am glad to have Krazy Fish as my new neighbor.",

    "text": "Had to make an account special for this review.   *Brunch Review*  The below experiences are True for me as well as the people I've dined with.   I only get one dish for brunch. The French Toast Platter. Twice I've received cold, wet, egg saturated pieces of bread.   Egg dishes are supposed to come with a biscuit. Can't tell you how those taste because I never seem to get one.   The bacon, oh the bacon. The bacon on more than one occasion has looked like gnarled pieces of flash fried beef jerky. I don't know what the deal with that is. But hey, sometimes they do you a favor and forget to give you bacon altogether.   Waited an hour for food most recently and 2 hours the trip before. I thought that was a fluke as the manager or someone explained they were short staffed.  Methinks not.   I guess my recommendation is to come within an hour of opening for brunch or you may be in for a long wait for subpar dishes with missing items.   1 Star for Jalapeno Cheddar Grits and the Roasted Potatoes because they are they only enjoyably edible parts of my brunch 99% of the time.",

If you want an appetizer, the pineapple salsa in the trio sampler is awesome! They have a great selection to choose from and always have great specials going on. $1 mystery beers make it worth while (if you don't mind that you may or may not end up with a PBR). Plenty of outdoor patio space make this place a must see.  So far, this place has never been overly crowded --- that may change once its episode of Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives airs, so check it out now!",

I don't think the chips and salsa were worth the five bucks, though.Chips were run of the mill. Having said that I am a fan of thin chips that are seasoned. I only liked one of the 3 sauces.I believe it was chipotle. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful with the menu, as it can seem overwhelming at first. Large menu and hard to choose.Nice beer selection and full bar. The place is funky with Guy Fieri's face painted on the outside of the building. If you're hitting the clubs in that area definitely give it a try.",

My husband ordered Neptune's platter, which is a giant plate of deep fried fish and vegetables.  I of course sampled everything and it was wonderful.

I'm not kidding when I say it was like eating a thick soup.  Bleh.  I knew in one bite, I had made a mistake.  The gal next to me got the fried fish chips and she literally ate like 4 pieces and left the rest. She was too polite to say anything. The waitress didn't even ask why she didn't eat her plateful of food.  The place was soooo cold.  Definitely bring a jacket if you eat here, but personally I don't care to return.",

We had a Bloody Mary, salsa sampler, fried grouper tacos with Mac and cheese and salmons tacos with cheddar grits. All 3 salsas were great. The tacos were STUFFED full of fresh, tasty fish and salsa/slaw. I gotta say...these are the best, biggest tacos I've had in Charlotte. Cabo Fish Taco doesn't have anything on Krazy Fish...these were way better. Everything was a great value too. The drinks are good and cheap.

First, parking is on premise and close by so it's easy like I like it! I have heard and read about bad service experiences here, but this visit, like my others, the server was engaged and fun, and very effecient. We are leisurely diners, and never felt rushed. She gave good recommendations and answered lots of menu questions. They have a full bar. We got mussels to share to start. They were delicious, prepared in curry. This is a spicy dish, so if you dont care for that, be aware!The portion was very large and easily could be a full meal themselves. There are lots of fried dishes on the menu, but we still had plenty of options.   I got Red Curry w shrimp and tofu for my entree, and my friend got the blackened tuna. His face was so sad after he tasted mine that I switched plates with him for a while so he could have some of it. (The tuna was okay, but the Red Curry was just outstanding.) I had a hard time getting my plate back! Generous portion of protein w a variety of vegetables, served with their Krazy Rice, which by the way was cooked perfectly- just enough stick to hold the grains together. The place filled up, and it was noisy with happy people, families, etc. But, it's a funky little place that was even better because of it.",

We went on a Sunday afternoon and it just us and like a couple of other tables so they were not busy at all and the service was so incredibly slow and bad. Our appetizer and the kids meal we ordered came out pretty fast but then we literally waited for like 30 minutes for our food which we learned later was just sitting under the heat lamps for like 15 minutes. There were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there. And our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there. Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good. Aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down. The kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it. This was a bummer because this was a place we were excited to visit and we left not even enjoying or completing our meal.",

The Fried Shrimp w Sweet potato curry over potato cakes was Awesome.     Chips and Salsa, I had the gringo, pinapple and the roasted poblano I think, and couldnt have asked for any better.   I honestly cant remember the 3rd course name.   Something to the effect of seafood curry, with fried seafood on top, rice in the middle.   FREAKIN FANTASTIC!   fourth course was a mojito and some $1 beer.   Fifth course,  Bananas Foster Creme Brulee,   not eggy creme brulee,  more creme,   very very good.  and for the final course bc I just was not finished....   Yes  6th course!    The ribs, they were a special offering and lets just say I hope I didnt ruin my craving for smoked ribs that I was planning on doing this weekend.    KC does it again.   Even the smoked half rack was excellent!     If you remember Fat City, and you remember the food, you will want to go to Crazy Fish.    The mac and cheese is there, the squash casserole is there,  the corn bread,  and several other old recipes were on the menu.     Enough about the food.    The service was top notch as well.    Nobody was slacking there.    If I could remember the girls name I would give her commendations.   Young, Blond,  knows her menu quite well.     All in all.

I grabbed some lunch with my mom and when we walked in the door we immediately noticed the funky interior.  Knowing this use to be a Pizza Hut, then a few bars; this place has changed for the better.    Sat down and reviewed the menu, lots of good choices, especially different style tacos.  I went with the Krazy Pad Thai.  This dish was oozing with flavor, especially the slaw.  I mixed everything together, added some Sriracha, and the meal was magnificent.  Next time I order this I'll ask them to spice it up in the kitchen, great flavor, just not spicy enough for me.  My mom chose the red snapper taco's with a side of mac and cheese, interesting pairing but hey I've done Krazier so who am I to talk.  Anyway, the fish came out lightly breaded and perfectly fried.  The sauce that was drizzled over the tacos was exceptional; Sweet, spicy, a little tangy, it worked.  The mac and cheese, as mom put it, was not as good as hers and I wasn't going to argue, but I liked it.  The top was loaded with Cheddar Cheese and I feel like they also mixed some cream cheese in the body of the dish; this gave it a rich taste which I enjoyed.  The only negative about this experience was the time it took to get our food.  The place wasn't crowded at all and it took over 20 minutes to get our food, not cool.",

My pad thai was so greasy and the shrimp in it smelled shellfishy. Honestly, the smell of the pad thai reminded me of my wet dog and made me sick to my stomach. My partner who is usually not a picky eater couldn't even finish his second taco. Overall this place is overrated and I will not be a return customer.

Also worth trying is the cuban and pulled pork. Oh,oh . . . and for your sides, I recommend the jalepeno grits.",

    "text": "OUCH....this describes my experience here.  3 star concept....3 star funky fishy decor.....1 star execution.  I can forgive a place for being a bit frantic on a Friday night but ummmmm your restaurant was just half-full.  Hmmmm.  So my fellow yelpette and I were here last Friday and immediately you notice the energy of the staff.  Frantic really doesnt seem to describe it.  Terrified seems to fit better (I know we are gorgeous and thus intimidating but please really guys.....har har...)    Yes loved the $2 IceHouse but things went downhill quickly from there. The special on the chalkboard by the hostess stand was winking at me as soon as I walked in the door.  $13.95 for Red Curry Fish with rice and a side salad.  When I ordered the special from the waiter I had said I would like the curry more on the mild side and he said 'yes yes' and appeared to write that down.  So yes I was very surprised when I got a shrimp appetizer instead of what I ordered (yes it was another special listed on the board).  It wasnt as though it was supposed to be sent to another table, our waiter literally had no idea what the specials were and just decided to pick one for me?!  Thus ensued more frantic behavior from the staff.  When I did get my dinner (while my lovely dinner partner just picked politely at her plate so as to not be rude)  the dish was fine (not great) but the side salad was lost in Never Never Land....  So when he brought the check and had charged me the full amount, I politely pointed out that either he adjust the bill or bring me a side salad to go.  He did the latter.  This place is a non-repeat for me.....there are just too many other options that are fab and consistent less than a mile in any direction.  Bad Fishy!",

    "text": "We first went here with friends for half price tacos.  I had shrimp tacos and grits.  I had never had a shrimp taco before and it was just divine!  There were two tacos, dressed with cabbage and a spicy pineapple salsa.  I do not eat grits, but thought I'd give these a try because of the cheese and jalapeno in them.  These grits are to die for!  They are creamy, cheesy and have just enough kick to be a little hello in your mouth.  The service our first visit was a bit show, even though we were the only guests there.  We were all out of beverages so I walked up to the bar to request refills and reorders.  The owner was standing there and completely flipped his lid, screaming and yelling at staff who were out back smoking.  LoL. The service for way better, even though I was mortified!  Since then, we visited almost weekly for a variety of foods and great drink specials.  The good is always fresh, the flavors and good are consistent and enjoyable, and the service had been well above average.  If you're looking for a really casual place with an outdoor eating area and a separate outdoor bar.  This is the place!  They have great food, great prices and specials, and a variety of foods made well and they are very consistent with good service.",

If you want to have the same experience I had  I suggest grabbing a seat on the patio - asking for Susan to wait on you - order a couple of mojitos and some tacos.  What kind of tacos?  Well the one thing I can say about Krazy Fish is you will have plenty of options to choose from  and there is a lot more than just  tacos on the menu,  Ceviche, steak, curry's, tofu, etc. etc.  On the recommendation of some great yelp reviews I went with the tacos.  I was so happy with my meal the pulled pork taco was my favorite and Danielle G. right on with the Pink Gold sauce it truly was a amazing.  Put this place on the top of your list to try and save room for the berry cobbler a completely unexpected delicious surprise.  Oh and before I forget the prices rock.",

I have periodically frequented Krazy Fish since then and after each visit in the recent months I must say my opinion has changed dramatically. Although the atmosphere lately is anything but fun and upbeat and downright uncomfortable at times, I find myself returning for the simple fact that the food is always delicious. As for the drinks, I have to say it's hit or miss, most of the time it seems the person behind the bar is basically \"winging it\". They have a decent wine and beer selection and always have beer specials so I would recommend going that route considering it's hard to screw that up. The service has never been over the top great which I have to sum up to poor management and lots of yelling going on (even with a full dining room) and at times looks to be down right nasty. I have personally witnessed servers on the verge of tears which would explain new faces just about every time I have dined here. Such a shame that this place has so much potential but who wants to dine at a place where it seems that there is always some sort of turmoil brewing behind the scenes? I would definitely recommend the food, however, let me suggest you call in your order and eat it in the comfort of your own home so that you can fully enjoy your meal. The Salmon Tacos are the best and will not disappoint.",

Their tacos is the same texture when it comes to their taco shell slightly fried like Cabo Fish Taco.  Their menu and style is interesting as they have food items and flavors of Asian, Jamaican, Mexican, and Soul southern.  You cannot go wrong with any of their tacos. Make sure when you walk in and look at the chalkboard for their specials. That's what we did when it comes to their grouper and sea bass tacos and I tell you what, they were AMAZING and do not skimp on the fish!

As expected, he loved it as much as I did.  It's truly a \"Krazy\" looking place, somewhat of a dive with lotsa funky decorations floating about...and the menu is quite eclectic, featuring everything from Southern American and Cajun, to Thai and Indian!  There were so many mouth-watering options, it was quite hard to choose...but I went with one of their fancy house specialty,\"Seafood Creole\".  Although it was a bit too heavy on the sauce,  the spicy flavor lived up to my expectations.  As expected, I also enjoyed the fried varieties of seafood in this massive dish (huge portion)!  My husband went with one of their customized \"Rotis\", and he enjoyed every bite of it.  Did I mention that they also have amazing Gumbo soups??  It's too bad that we live so far away from this restaurant, but with such Krazy good food at a value (and great service too!), we WILL return!",

The waiter replaced the grits but I was too grossed out to eat them  When the check came there was no compensation for my gross food! I spoke with the manager who kept insisting that since they gave me a fresh dish they would not comp it. I told him there was no way I could eat it - kept thinking about the dead fly I almost ate! The manager then talked to the owner in back, he said, but the owner couldn't be bothered to come out to talk to me. He gave his manager the message that there was nothing he could do. Bottom line - check the Food for bugs before you eat it and if you find one, they obviously don't care. Not even an apology.",

Veggies should have been fresh?? Come on guys!  Well, I guess the distinctive part of the menu was the gallery of different ethnicity because it had Cajun to Asian (yes, theres pho on the menu).

Yum. The salmon was nicely cooked and the toppings and sauce really complimented the fish. This dish is on the sweeter side. For the side, the jalapeno cheese grits were excellent. Super rich and creamy but I didn't get any jalapeno heat or flavor. I'd get them again. I really appreciated that the flour tortillas were lightly fried, which gave them a nice texture.   - Blackened Tuna Entree... Small portion of \"blackened\" tuna. The fish was taco quality, not super high-grade. It came out overcooked and flavorless. Served with canned green beans, flavorless rice topped chicken gumbo. The best part of the meal was the starter salad. For $19, I was pretty disappointed at the plate that came out. They really should take this off their menu. I guess it serves me right for ordering something other than tacos at a fish taco place.   I'll definitely be back for the tacos.",

You'll find \"Krazy\" interpretations of fish hanging from the walls and ceiling! They've converted an old Pizza Hut to house their yummy tacos and Southern sides.   The service was friendly and the food came out quickly, yet freshly made to order. My first visit I ordered a special Schezwan salmon taco. It was very flavorful! The next time I had the Ceviche tacos. Unless you like a lot of tang from limes, you may want to pick another one. I didn't care for all the zest...it actually made my tongue feel raw.

It is really hard to anticipate what to expect with this restaurant based on the reviews, but the place has it's very own personality - a unique one at that.  The weather was nice so we decided to sit outside on the patio.  It did eventually get pretty cool, but nothing that a margarita couldn't fix.  I tried the \"Ghetto Surfer\" which was pretty good.  The other drinks on the drink menu sounded super unique and worthy of at least one try.  The menu is a bit overwhelming since in the first 30 seconds I was reading about tacos, then right next to it is korean inspired fair... or if you weren't starting to get dizzy reading the descriptions, there is thai, southern style food, and other food types.  Great if you were feeling adventurous, but I would not recommend it if you were expecting a certain (one) genre of food.  Our server was nice and told us about the specials.  I went with the special:  Szechuan Salmon Tacos with a side.  I chose jalapeno cheddar grits.....  DELICIOUS!  My plate was clean in a matter of seconds.  Overall a CRAZY.... but good crazy... experience.  Can't wait to come back to try the ribs [in blueberry sauce??!!??].",

And the menu is great. A nice mix of meat and vegetarian options, and some exotic variations on tacos.   But, as with all restaurants, all of this is precariously balanced on top of the food.   The bad:  My wife got the blackened tuna tacos. They gave a *generous* portion of blackened tuna. And therin lies the problem. It was mostly just fish, slightly fishy fish and tons of it, juicing out and making the taco soggy. I got the potato tacos, which were indian spiced with a blueberry chutney. They tasted similar, but not quite as vibrant as samosas you'd get at an Indian restaurant. They were fairly dry, and again, it was just two large lumps of potato really. The blueberry chutney was very good though. Both of our dishes could have easily been kicked up a few notches to really round out a great experience.   We will be back to give it another shot. The mixed bag of reviews this place has makes me think they have a few different cooks who aren't all on the same level. Seems to be a lottery whether you'll get amazing food or mediocrity. I find it to be that way at many Charlotte restaurants, and you know what? That's a real shame. Pick it up Charlotte.",

It's got a funky, fun, hippie atmosphere and it's laid back ambiance is really contagious, this is especially True for some of the people who work there. The staff is fantastic but make sure you go there with some patience, order 1 more drink than you typically would, and enjoy the experience.   Their tacos are creatively delicious works of art. I've tried all of them and have yet to be disappointed. Same goes for their sides. My all time favorites are their beets, side salad and squash casserole. Those side choices might make me sound like an 80 year old man, but I just can't help it. They are too good.   Little secret, if you love their Seafood Diablo (a heavenly mixture of Asian seasonings/curry with all the best seafood you can think of) and it's not a nightly special, ask your waiter if the kitchen would be willing to make it. They always have every time we've gone and asked.   Krazy Fish always has some krazy specials, those paired with their menu have yet to disappoint me in the 30+ times I've been there. What ever the chefs were inhaling when they were creating their culinary masterpieces has me coming back for more and singing their praises.",

    "text": "Seriously strange, this place. From the Mad Scientist Acid Trip Under the Sea decor to the banana salsa to the...just...huge, newspaper sized menu, there are some really outta-the-norm things going on at Krazy Fish.  And I gotta say, I likey.  Things are messy - ya, there's brownie-filled orange cups for dessert for cheap, but they're overfilled, spilling out a bit. A salsa brought to the table in an icy squeeze bottle. A cold, intestinal coil of cheese grits solidifying while your sandwich is steaming hot. Water all over the bathroom floor. Corners, art to run into. Cilantro in everything, all hail the cheapest herb, garnish, chopped, springs tucked into your taco, sandwich, salsa, everywhere.  It's almost, kind of a foodie joint, because anything, anywhere, on the menu, can be put in any burrito, any sammich, any taco. There are near-infinite combinations of flavor happening and not a lot of steering going on - a gruff rec by a waitress, that's about it - so it's easy to choose and end up with something freaky-not-good. OR (like moi) you could get jittery with excitement, anticipating what lemongrassy tofu, pickled jalapenos, and coconut curry could possibly taste like, and WHOA it kinda worked, even if it was a little sweet. Things are, here. Sugary. Riding that edge of too much. Not taking the plunge.  Other options for veg's - tempura vegetables, potato cake. You can have a potato cake taco. Dare ya.  House slaw is riskily weird, but good - toasted cumin, a little bitter, Indian flavors.  There are like, 10 salsas. I even enjoyed the banana, sort of.  It's beautiful that no one worried about foodie trendy BS when designing this space or menu. It's just all really Krazy, in an homage-to-East-Charlotte-ethnicity kinda way. Tacos, bolillos, banh mi, burritos (er, roti), viet, mex, thai, indo, chinese, whoa.",

I think that 'something' might be a little bit the food and a little bit the atmosphere.The menu looks so interesting when you're reading through it.. it's one of those menus that gets you all confused because you want to try everything - the tacos, the roti (essentially a burrito), the pad thai, the potato pancakes - there's so much variety! The food didn't live up to my expectation though. There was nothing bad about the food, but it wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting it to be. I didn't leave the restaurant thinking \"oh that was a soul satisfying meal\"  The ambiance - it's super casual, colorful, and friendly. It was a little annoying to have two completely different TV channels playing in the background + music.. it made for a noisy (not in a good way) atmosphere. I'm all for loud places, but usually there's some sort of harmony between all the noises in a restaurant, and that was not the case here. I'd say it's worth checking out if you're looking for a local, casual hang out with decent food and good daily drink specials.",

I so wanted it to be our new neighborhood spot, but was really disappointed. We started off with chips and salsa which were somewhere around $8.00 and was nothing but a small bowl of bottled salsa with Real Lime added and chips straight from the bag. I then chose the Cuban tacos.  The worst food I have ever had.  The tortillas were rained. The smelled like moth balls.  My husband had some sort of fried fish that tasted and looked like it had been under a heat lamp all day and you guessed it....straight from frozen box to fryer.  All this for around $45 including one cocktail and a beer. If you are looking for good inexpensive eats in Plaza Midwood I would suggest the Diamond, Thomas Street Tavern or Whiskey Warehouse.  For nicer dinner, but still reasonable Lulu or Soul would be my pick.",

I have to say we were very impressed with Krazy Fish.  The decor is wild but the food can't be beat.  We ordered the chips and salsa sampler using the suggestions from our wonderful waitress Tonya.  All the salsas were fresh and tasty.  We ordered the tuna tacos and they do not skimp on taco fillings!  There was so much tuna in the taco that it kept falling out!  It was perfectly prepared and the salsa complimented the other flavors.  Although the choice of sides are a little strange (cheese grits and mac n cheese with tacos?) it was all so delicious that we didn't care!  We also were fortunate enough to be there between 4-6 pm so our tacos were half price!  Even the regular price of tacos is well worth the money because of the generous portions of taco fillings and sides.  Tonya was attentive, helpful and completely on point with drinks, appetizers and entrees.  Most would think by the looks of the place that service would be lacking but that is not the case at all.  We will definitely be back and will share with our friends the great experience we had at Krazy Fish.",

    "text": "* A preamble rant:  I have a rule - never go to a restaurant that is less than 2 months old.  too many bad experiences, and there are so many kinks to work out.  and every time i break this rule, i remind myself that i really need to obey my rules more.  having just opened a month ago, Krazy Fish is still experiencing some growing pains.  Today, they were still in the process of installing computers/registers, our itemized receipts were handwritten on blank receipt paper.  The server we had, while very nice and friendly, was brand new and it showed - drink mix ups, had to reconfirm order a couple times.  no serious detriments in time or service, but small annoyances that are specific to new restaurants.  thats why i have rules.  All that aside... the food is fantastic, a blend of mexican, asian, and seafood fusion.  they have tacos and bolillos, pho and pad thai, among many other choices, and most come with choice of chicken, pork, or various seafoods.  the menu is dominated with taco, roti, and bolillo possibilities, but there are many other entree options, and it took a fair amount of time to parse through the data and come to a final decision.  also their food is fairly cheap, everything we got was less than $10 per item.  the chef and management are really on to something.   -Roti - w/ cuban chicken, Jamaican curry, small salad + 1 side.  the \"roti\", or flour tortilla, is very good, and this is basically a GIANT burrito with rice, choice of meat, and choice of curry inside.  while the chicken was a bit dry and the burrito overall was dry and could have used more curry (which was delicious),  it was still very good, very filling.  my side was squash casserole, which was super cheesy but good. -Rotisserie chicken - w/ habanero apple butter, cornbread + side.  it was really good and the habanero apple butter really set it off.  side was seasoned green beans, also very good.   -Tacos - tempura chicken and shrimp, +1 side.  both chicken and shrimp were good.  you can mix n match your meats and your salsas.  fresh made flour tortilla was tasty.  roasted potatoes as side were really good.    inside decor is definitely plaza midwood-y, very artsy, sometimes frightening, sometimes confusing.  custom made tables and benches, and strange mobiles decorating the ceiling.  very unique in the style that we all know and love about that small strip of Central Ave.    bottom line:  in a month, after they have gone through puberty and worked out all the operational kinks, this place will be 5 star worthy.  i will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "I saw this new place pop up, and it looked interesting. After all the reviews I read, I figured it would be a cool place to try out with my girlfriend. When we first walked in, the decor and look of the place felt \"cool\". It seemed pretty eclectic, and definitely a fun atmosphere. The layout of this restaurant is open so that you can see all the other tables and the bar. We were greeted right away, and told of a number of great specials. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable and seemed to have good suggestions for drinks and food. The menu was very different and almost difficult to choose because so many things looked soooo good. The one main problem I did have with this restaurant is that when we were there, the man behind the bar seemed to be a manager of some type. He obviously was not having a very god day because he felt the need to yell very loudly at his staff, telling them that \"if they did not do a good job they would be fired\" and proceeded to go on and on about how every little mistake that a server made \"could cost them their job\". Now I am all for a manager making sure that his staff is following company policy, As I have worked in the food service industry for over 10 years, but it was very very disturbing and very uncomfortable for me and my girlfriend and I'm sure the rest of the guests to have to sit and listen to a manager go off on his staff for things like \"not having enough pens\" while trying to have dinner. I was very pleased by the job our server did. The food was amazing, the service was great, the manager behind the bar is what made me and my girlfriend not want to come back. These conversations, and tirades should have NOT occurred out in the dining room, and the manager should know better. That type of attitude from a manager/bar tender on a power trip is not impressive, and does not encourage me to come back. My suggestion is either order togo because the food is SOOO good, or go on a night when that guy isnt working.",

Shrimp in the taco was not overcooked, a plus, but they were served in an \"Old Elpaso\" shell straight off the supermarket shelf. There was another protein substance in the taco that the server was told was chopped clam, but was really chicken. ???  There was also one long cilantro stem in the shell. That's it.   Not at all what was described in the menu and Truely awful.  Margarita was sub-par and the squash casserole was watery with large globs of stringy cheese. After I asked questions about what I was served and it was clear that I was unhappy (yet pleasant) our table was avoided by the server and manager. They made no effort to rectify their errors or make me happy.  I am not one to be critical, but this place is to be avoided.  Too many other people out there who know what they're doing and deserve your patronage.  If you have an open kitchen the folks preparing the food need to be aware and keep their hands off their faces and out of their hair.",

Over the past year I've gone back a few times and none of that was even\"sort of\" delivered. Seems like the place is going downhill since its beginning days. Tacos were meh, I remember I ordered the chilly willy po boy, the shrimp wasnt so good, looked like that frozen popcorn shrimp out of a bag, however jalapeno and cilantro on top made me like it. My buddy got \"cuban chicken\" - not good. Some dry grilled chicken topped with a tomato sauce...  The side dishes are quite the variety.

Krazy Fish has its own parking lot, which is nice in Plaza Midwood, and we were greeted as soon as we walked in.  The decor is fun and funky, and our waiter, Duncan, was friendly and helpful with menu suggestions since it was our first time there.  We tried the Krazy Grill with chicken, pork, jalapeno grits and squash casserole and the Cuban Chicken tacos with green beans.  It was all delicious!  I don't even like grits, but I couldn't stop eating these.  Everything had just the right amout of spice, and you can't beat the price considering how much food you get.  It almost felt like a Cuban Midwood Smokehouse, which is a compliment to both restaurants!",

As a frequent diner the food is consistent! Delicious every time. Never fails. We usually get the tacos and I've ordered another dish that came with two sides, and it was just as great. Their salsas are unique and fresh. The service is better than the food, and the food is pretty damn good. The people really make this place for sure.",

The chips are not the best I have had, but they aren't the worse.  The salsa is what make the appetizer.  They give you 3 types of salsa, and my favorite is the pineapple based one.  I also usually get one of their delicious adult beverages whether it's a margarita, mixed drink, or sangria.  I always, always get 2 fish tacos with the grits.  First off, the grits are AMAZING!  They are a must get side unless you absolutely hate grits.  When it comes to the fish tacos, all of them are good.  I always get one of them as tuna and usually go for a taco special for the other one.  They are awesome and let you choose any 2 for only a little bit extra charge.  The staff is always nice and helpful, too!  Krazy Fish was featured on Triple D which is pretty cool!  The only downside of Krazy Fish is that I always crave it on Monday...the one day they are not open :(  My friends have also said brunch is amazing, so I hope to try it soon!",

    "text": "I'll preface this review by saying I have only been here once and with their extensive menu options it is quite possible there are 4 and 5 star items to be had.  First of all, from the outside, this place looks \"crazy\"...it reminded me of a trailer park or actually of my neighbor down the street that puts everything they can find that is tin in their yard and calls it good landscaping.  This place was like a junk yard with a fish theme but it was cool and certainly down to earth.  The inside decor remained consistent with the exterior.  Our waitress seemed really happy to be there and even sat down at our table to describe the specials and featured items on the menu.  I got the \"act\" but it was over done and I wasn't much in the mood for it.  I can just picture the staff meetings in the mornings..\"ok do what it takes for shock value, just act crazy kids!! Make it a super fun environment.\"  Nah, it didn't bother me too bad and it was \"fun\" but my real pet peeve surfaced when the only menu choices she reccommended were the most expensive.  She went on to say \"really for your first time in you have to go with one of the specials.\"    Against her wishes I went with the blackened tuna tacos that came with their house slaw and pineapple salsa on top.  They were decent but not amazing and maybe I am wrong in saying that for blackened tuna I expected it cooked through but it was really rare and cold...it just didn't work well as a taco.  I chose the squash casserole as suggested for my side and it was ok but lukewarm and not overly thrilling.  We ordered the cheesecake brownie ala mode but there was nothing cheesecake about the brownie...pretty standard, nothing special.  I give them credit for their creative menu and friendly environment but I won't make a habit of returning.  I will say it is worth going mid week when their tacos are half off...that may be more of a justified price.",

Ordered the Cuban chicken with 2 sides (potatoes and green beans).  The food was bordering room temp. The chicken was a small breast/thigh and kindof weird to attempt to cut. Nothing special.  The potatoes were similar to ones I make a home, just colder. The green beans had a different flavor, but didn't amaze me. The best part was cornbread and I'm not even a big bread eater. One in our party received her burger well done when she was explicit in describing that she wanted it as rare as possible. They remedied this by quickly brining her another burger with more sides.  Came with a large party (8) and received our food in a timely fashion. However we never received refills on our drinks. Took a while to get our checks, despite there was a light crowd.  No plans to go back.",

Normally, I'd label it as slum-y but it's laced with a perfect amount of funky re-purposed junk that just radiates fun and happy. Plus, I loved the sparkly tables.   Menu is equally as quirky. Pairings you normally wouldn't think of, but are a huge success! Lots of fish tacos, vegetarian options, appetizers. Flavorings range from southern to Vietnamese to Mexican to Indian.   I recommend the lemongrass tofu tacos, they're off the chain! Perfect large portion of fried tofu, fresh handmade mini tortilla, krazy slaw (house made), and a blueberry tamarind chutney... YES!   I've tried other sides, but the JALAPENO CHEDDAR CHEESE GRITS are by far the most superior selection. Heavenly even.",

Husband's calamari tacos were, as they say, \"off the chain\". Prices are super decent, especially if you stick with anything that's not on the \"Entrees\" part of the menu.

And I um forget which drink I had off the great drink menu.. because it was really good and I drank it all....plus we had to sample the $1 mystery beer, you just gotta ;-)   Porter brought us a sample of the famous jalapeno cheese grits, creamy cheesy goodness with just a little kick.  Then later described the dessert menu, in which one item sounded like food porn--winner! But it was getting late, so we ordered the warm bananas foster glazed cheesecake to go.

    "text": "Krazy Fish is an interesting little Mexican fusion place. I used to come here fairly often when living in Charlotte.  The first time I came here I was WOWED and perplexed at why I had never even heard of this place. Before I moved to Winston, I was house hunting a couple streets down and stumbled upon Krazy Fish and decided to check it out.  It's not one of Charlotte's most popular eateries and is hardly ever busy from what I've seen...to this day I've tried to figure out why.  The tacos are great! My favorite is the ceviche taco, which they do well. They have all kinds of odd flavors such as blueberry BBQ (haven't tried it but it looks good).  Perhaps one of my favorite things about Krazy Fish is the $1 mystery beer. They don't tell you what kind of beer it is, but you get a glass for just a dollar! Whatever it was it didn't taste like pee-water, so it's a good deal!  The decor is a bit odd to me. Outside they have tons, and I mean TONS of little metal fish sculptures. Cool, right? Well, when you go inside, it looks like a dive bar. I don't think the interior really matches the exterior.  Also, it is quite a walk from the main strip of Central Ave, and the walk takes you through a bit of a shady area. So, you can walk, but heed caution. I wouldn't walk there at night.  It's a far cry less fancy than the places in Plaza-Midwood's main area, but if you like an artsy fish trap-type restaurant with cheap beer and good food, it's a great little eatery! Sometimes I prefer it over the bougie-ness of regular Plaza-Midwood.",

She told them she didn't eat dark meat and at first they were like they don't have white chicken- huh? Chicken and waffles are traditionally served with wings so if they don't serve with wings the menu should specify served with dark meat which it does not.  At a minimum The server should have explained that as well.  They finally brought out fried chicken tenders which looked like fried clams because of how tiny the strips were.",

The blend of spicy, sweet and sour of the Krazy slaw is a divine combination.  Speaking of divine combination, you can not go wrong with the ceviche as a starter!  In addition to excellent food, the cocktails aren't too bad. I had the Peach Bellini, which, in all honesty was not the best I have had. However, with the Sunday Bellini special...why not try a few until you find one you like.  The few sips of a friend's jalapeno margarita tells me it's the better choice.    And, as a Southerner, it's only right that I comment on their grits. They are creamy, fluffy, cheesy with an after hint of heat from the jalapenos. Not the best pair with the Szechuan tacos but wicked as a stand-alone nonetheless.   The service is great, the staff are knowledgeable, the drinks are good and I've decided that the chef is righteous (there's no other excuse for such goodness)...you can't go wrong here!",

I ended up getting the Roti with southern fried Calamari and Lemongrass Curry with a side of Jalapeno Cheddar Grits. It was absolutely amazing. I loved the sauce the most. I would definitely get it again if there weren't so many other things I wanted to try on the menu. My husband got the Krazy Grill with Cuban Chicken and Potato Cakes with Habanero Apple Butter and sides of Jalapeno Cheddar Grits and Picked Beets. I liked what my husband got but didn't think it was as good as mine. I'm not a big fan of grits, but these were really good. They were a little spicy without being too hot.   We were seated right away and the service was really good. Plus they usually have a Groupon.   You get a ton of food for the price.  I couldn't finish all of mine.

    "text": "We went to Krazy Fish because another place that just opened on The Plaza (no names! You might figure it out yourself) didn't take any more patrons - they \"had to close the kitchen\" because they were \"to busy\". Whatever.  Krazy Fish however absolutely made up for it. It wasn't very busy (Wednesday night) and the waiter was very attentive. Everything came out extremely fast and was delicious.  We had fried calamari for starters, I had the shrimp & grits which were very good and far from the bland stuff you sometimes get. My wife had the mussels which also were good.  To add to this it was 1/2 priced wine bottles and we had a bottle of cab for $10. You can't beat that.  Only four stars? When you sit outside it's nice but it's also pretty noisy from Central Avenue.  All in all a good experience and we will be back!",

MASSIVE PORTIONS and would recommend sharing since they each come with a side. If you're in the CLT area, this is a must see.",

We ordered the Green Thai Curry Mussels as our starter and they were some of the best mussels I have had, the favors were perfect. For my entree I opted for the Seafood Creole and when I say it's a lot of food, it really is but I'm not complaining. It has both fried and  sauteed seafood (so best of both worlds) with a creole sauce over rice. I'm just upset I didn't know about this place before.",

    "text": "Total let down !! My friend suggested we try this place out and I informed her she is now permanently banned from making any suggestion of anywhere to eat lol . First what I would like to say Krazy Fish is the perfect name for this place because everything on the outside to the inside of this establishment looked crazy and kooky but in a good way ! Outside of that everything about this place rubbed us the wrong way from the food, to the drinks , to some of the staff!! I ordered the ceviche which was actually ok and I loved the fact that our waitress allowed me to test it out before ordering because it had such a distinctive taste . My friend ordered the cat fish dinner which she said was ok as well but both of us hated our drinks they were watered down and just not good at all no flavor etc. So my friend pointed out to me that on the menu it stated if your drinks came fast you couldn't get a refund or exchange which I thought was weird. Of coarse I didn't care because I'm not paying for something I don't like so I let the waitress know she told us how the bartender was having a bad day he got in a fight the previous day before as if that has anything to do with us we just wanted the drinks replaced . The bartender his self came out and apologized and mentioned how he didn't like the drink either that I chose so just pick another one . Side eye . He suggested the liquid marijuana which was overly sweet as if someone poured the entire jar of sugar into the drink . In the mist of it I stopped a young guy working there and asked what his name was and his reply was why!? Ummm so once he seen the look on my face he hurried and switched it up and I told him the only reason I was asking because I needed our waitress name because I couldn't remember it and needed to get her attention. By this time we were both over it and just asked for our checks so we could get out of Krazy Krazy Fish!!! Oh and may I add they still added the drinks on our checks although it was stated they would be removed neither of us touched our drinks money thrown down the drain .",

    "text": "Wow..I can't even explain how bad my experience was here recently.  I wish I could give a negative star. Without writing an absolute novel, I'll give a few highlights.    Absolute WORST SERVICE I have ever received.  We were there for 2.5 hours!  The craziest part is the restaurant wasn't even busy.  It was actually pretty depressing how slow it was inside.  The only facade they had of business were the few people on the outside patio facing central. We were with our kids and they were perished.  Anyone with kids knows how hard it can be to not get their food and have poor service. Once they finally received their food it was disgusting looking.  They wouldn't touch it and I wouldn't blame them.  We ordered the chips and salsa trio and the salsa was ok, except for the fact the chips were so stale.  Seems like they just poured them out of a bag that had been opened for a couple months.  Everyone in my party got different variations of tacos.  Tacos were decent but not great by any means.  By the time we got the tacos everyone was so mad and ready to go we could barely taste them. Our waiter would NOT bring us the bill.  We went to see the manager / host whatever 3 times! We finally waited at the front and just stood there for another 20 minutes to get our bill.  There were so many other issues I could go on and on. NO ONE there ever apologized and essentially seemed mad at us that we were complaining! It was very obvious every customer in there was in the same boat.    Whatever you do, stay away from this place.  I really hate to say this because I'm all for some good dive spots and anyone trying to do something unique.  But when it comes to getting treated so poorly, it absolutely can not be tolerated.",

Be sure to order some extra toast to sop up the delicious curry broth with. It's a huge portion too (even though it's marketed as an appetizer), so there's plenty to share.  Their sangria is pretty legit, and I almost always order a glass of that when it's on special.  Order the Bulgogi beef tacos with a side of Jalapeno cheddar grits, and you basically have the perfect meal! :)  **Oh, some of the other favorite things that I've had are the Peanut Butter Jelly wings, the lemongrass tofu tacos, and the blueberry tamarind sauce is delicious too**",

I ordered the blackened mahi tacos but am not a fan of slaw, so I asked if I could get lettuce on the side instead.  Yay, not a problem here!   The tacos came with a pineapple salsa that was quite enjoyable. The blackened mahi had a nice level of seasoning and the dish came with some sort of raspberry concoction to put over the tacos. Looked a bit odd, but the flavors went well together.    The only downside to my meal was the Krazy rice - it was rather bland. (Basically, sticky-ish  white rice with some carrots & peas but not a lot of flavor.)  I think next time I will skip the rice and try the jalapeno cheddar grits instead.   Overall though, I thought the food was pretty solid and I would certainly come back to try some of their other dishes.",

If this could spill over into your food, you'd have a winner.  The food was overly salted and overly greasy.  Shrimp and grits aren't suppose to be a ladled level of grease. I could dig around in the grits and find some creamy parts.  But I was not over impressed.  We also has the mussels appetizer, the mussels didn't taste fresh and with seafood, that's a necessity for me.  The sauce was good. And that dish stops there.  I'm not sure I'll go to Krazy Fish again, one time was enough.",

A little off the main drag in Plaza Midwood, this place is a little hidden treasure. The atmosphere is cool & funky. We had great service & the menu is huge & diverse. Krazy Fish offers many unique seafood dishes. Three out of four of us got the Seafood Diablo - a permanent off-menu special (and Guy's featured dish on DDD). They LOVED it - huge portion, but they couldn't stop eating! In addition to lots of seafood options, there are some great tofu veg options including Thai & curry dishes. Krazy Fish is a unique dining experience for visitors of Charlotte as well as locals. We look forward to going back with friends soon!",

I ordered from the Krazy Grill cuban chicken my sides were beans and Krazy rice it also  came with cornbread! The cuban chicken was dry and I wasn't a fan of the vinegar based sauce. The beans and rice were just ok and nothing special about the cornbread.   The service was mediocre it felt like it took forever for our food to come because it did. They were not even busy at the time.   The only thing I liked was that they were kid friendly!",

It wasn't gross, but there was nothing special about it. I would order it again, because it was worth the $3.  I got bulgogi tacos and brisket tacos with a side of grits.  The bulgogi were my favorite because I'm a pickle enthusiast, but my boyfriend preferred the cheesy brisket tacos. We both left extremely full. I say, skip the ceviche- get some tacos and definitely the grits! Service was slow, but I'm not mad. Cool view of Charlotte and quirky atmosphere. Check it out if you're in the mood for something different, yummy, and super filling!",

I had a 'special' dish modeled after a Cajun jambalaya - with a chipotle cream sauce.  A bit off the straight & narrow perhaps, but 'WOW'!!  Succulent (not over cooked) scallops, shrimp and mahi-mahi with rice on the sauce. I was so impressed, I returned after my meeting for Fresh tuna tacos and a side of gumbo. Once again, knock yer socks off great!  Add a mug of cool local brew and I was on the road back home.  Top it off with gab with waitress, owner/chef and other patrons made a long travel day so, so much better.",

Upon arrival the host as well as passing waiters greeted us and were so upbeat, friendly & welcoming! Our waitress was wonderful and gave us some great suggestions since it was our first time there. The mussels were out of this world! Probably the best I have ever had! We also tried the brisket tacos and blackened tuna tacos!

    "text": "Krazy Fish has been on my radar for quite some time. With crazy steel art festooned on their front patio and dive-y exterior, what more could you ask for in Plaza Midwood? This place is ridiculous. Landing directly on Central Ave, it's not too hard to miss their parking lot. Turn in right before Morningside. Made that mistake once....  Glad to see that \"Krazy\" is first word in the name of this joint. Our server, Chad, was a freaking ray of sunshine. Hilarious and absolutely BLUNT. He had no problems telling us that some menu items were \"dumb\" if paired with others. He was jazzed to be there. What a great employee. He was fast, efficient and a great jokester.   Mystery beer is interesting....$1 and you'll, most likely, get a crappy beer. Haha. Worth the $1 laugh it brought to our table. Bud Light with lime. GAG.  Apps:  Started out with the potato cakes. These things are awesome. Plenty of veggies and in a creamy curry-ish sauce. I would have mistaken them for falafel had I not been told. I was happy and so were my taste buds. Throw a little sriracha on these bag boys and you'll experience Krazy enlightenment.   Entrees:  My wife got a fried veggie burrito. This thing rivals the size of a Chipotle or Moe's burrito. Packed full of rice and tons of tasty veggies. Loved the sauce that the veggies were sauteed in. Welcomingly sweet and a came full circle with the rest of her plate. The grits on the side were so thick and creamy. I'd have a full plate on my next visit if it were an entree. Delicious.   I tried the blackened tuna tacos. Holy crap. Pineapple salsa? I'd eat that on my foot. It was so good. Perky, cilantro-ey and so FRESH. I love every bit. Huge chunks of rare, seared tuna. The slaw, I'm pretty sure, is tossed in a bit of wasabi powder so it got dumped off my tacos lickity split. No offense. Just not a fan of wasabi. Got a side of the mac n' cheese per Chad's recommendation. So good. Soul food, meet Mexican. Be friends, I say.   Sampled the blueberry salsa and the chipotle honey. Very interesting. Look forward to trying them on their respective dishes on our next visit.   I'm happy to say Krazy Fish literally is crazy but absolutely intriguing. I can't wait to test more of the menu. Well done, ladies and gents. You've got something going here.",

( the sides were average) The \"roti\" is just a burrito with a looooooot of rice and a protein/veggie of your choice ( in my case lemongrass tofu) It was literally a carb full meal since it was a ton of rice inside of a tortilla shell with a little bit of tofu. I thought it was just okay. ( way too much rice) Probably will not order again.  The Korean beef tacos were flavorful but the portion was wayyyy too small. I think an average men will be able to eat at least 8 tacos ( so 4 orders)   Overall it was just okay...",

I actually had the red curry dish that came with chicken, shrimp, and tofu.  It was also served with a tortilla kinda bread and Krazy rice on the side.  It was very original and very well prepared.  I have eaten a lot of curries in my life, but never had one that came with three different proteins.  Loved it!   The atmosphere resembled something out of Key West.  Very funky and very fun.

You get an absolutely insane return on your investment, as each taco fills your hands with comfort and your mouth with tastiness.  All while your wallet barely feels a thing.

    "text": "Krazy Fish is such a kooky Midwood staple and that's exactly why I love it. It's in a random spot on the quieter end of Central with its own parking lot (nice). The decor is hilariously random and you'll notice something weird and different every time you go. There is plenty of seating, so you should be able to find a spot almost any time you show up.  They have the most eclectic menu you've ever seen, from curry to tacos. They have tofu options for almost every menu item, making this a vegetarian- and probably vegan-friendly spot.  There's a huge range in cost - you could spend $9 for dinner or $20+ ($18 for curry? how and why?!). It's not a very vegetable-intensive spot, so this isn't the healthiest option (and that's ok!).  The staff is super friendly and will help you through the menu if needed. They always have drink specials (and cheap drinks in general). They also offer brunch! I'll be back to try that out.",

However we have two children so we soldiered ahead. We ordered off of the kids menu for our 2 year old. Mac and cheese. My poor kid took one bite of his Mac and cheese and his tongue was on fire.  It was super spicy. When we told the waiter he causally said something along the lines of \"oh they must have used the Cajun cheese. They usually don't do that\". So we asked for regular cheese and he said it wasn't available.   Come on. It's a kids menu. Kids. At least warn the parents. We also ordered blackened fish tacos and Sichuan fried chicken wings. The Mac and cheese was spicier than any of those. And they called it Sichuan chicken!   The food wasn't bad but this place is  NOT GOOD FOR KIDS. Also empty on a Saturday can't be good.  But you can buy some random shorty T-shirt about how they were on TV once and I'm sure the tourists love it.",

    "text": "We have been wanting to try Krazy Fish for a while.   434 reviews and the top 20 or so are mostly 5 stars.   I am so glad we did, I would have to agree with all the reviews, we really had a terrific meal.   I did not post any pictures because all pictures that have been posted are accurate.  Starters - Lobster Chowder.   Excellent.  Giant chunks of lobster in a very light cream based chowder.  Side salad - my wife loved it - it had beets on it and a vinaigrette dressing.   Main Course - I went with the Seafood Creole.   Very interesting that they mix BOTH fried and sauteed seafood together!!!!   This is a huge plate of mixed seafood over Cajun seasoning.  You probably could share this plate.   So much food, it is overwhelming.........Excellent mix of fish, shrimp, calamari and scallops over Krazy Rice.  The Krazy Rice is sticky rice with veggies mixed in.   Both the lobster chowder and the seafood creole come with a large slab of cornbread, I did not like the cornbread whatsoever.    I do want to bring up something that I read in a few reviews.   I hate to agree with the bland flavor, yes I found it on a the bland side, but make sure you mix up the dish, the seafood was sitting on top on the sauce.   Also, I asked for some Old Bay and it was perfect.  Old Bay, salt and pepper = perfect!  My wife had the fish and chip special.  Very good large flaky white fish fried in a beer batter like breading.  The chips were homemade potato chips.  The chips were freshly made and excellent.      Lastly the staff.   What a great group of servers - all very attentive and excellent attitude.  Makes me think that the joint is just a cool place to work.",

    "text": "I happened to see the Diners, Drive in and Dives episode featuring Krazy Fish, so off we drove there for lunch.  Interesting atmosphere, friendly staff and unique menu. Brunch  menu on Sunday.  My dining mate and I ordered the Shrimp Gazpacho, served in a margarita glass, enough for 2 people. Spicy sweet gazpacho with tender shrimp. We enjoyed this with high expectations of our food to come.  My dining mate ordered the blackened tuna taco  with pineapple salsa which  came with krazy slaw and a side of squash casserole. I ordered the lemon grass curry with  choice of shrimp, beef, chicken or tofu and chose tofu.  The  dish served over rice with Krazy slaw I asked to opt the rice and ordered the side of the squash also. Food came out hot, good portions, plated nicely.  However here is where the disappointment starts. My dish had no inkling of any lemon grass flavoring to my taste.  The sauce was  thin , sweet  and vinegary. The tofu was chewy, seemed to me it had been fried previously and reheated for my dish. When asked about where was the krazy slaw, the server said it was in my dish, yes the sauce and tofu over thinly shredded cabbage which was now a soggy mush, no resemblance of slaw. The squash casserole, bland and average tasting.  My dining mate enjoyed his tuna taco said it was tasty  well seasoned but admitted the slaw  also in the taco, not as a side, made the taco soggy .  Menu prices moderate. Menu choices quite varied and something on the menu even for vegetarians,  variety of southern fried foods, sandwiches,  filled roti and tacos, Asian fusion dishes,  Sunday brunch, see menu photos below.  Lastly I was seated where I could see food prepared at the open kitchen grill. At least once I saw the female cook, use her bare hands instead of tongs to place an ingredient from a pot to the grill. Both the male and female wore no gloves for food handling.  Not sure we would return here again",

Yesterday we drove down from Greensboro specifically to have lunch at Krazy Fish.  It was worth the trip and we'll do it again.  I highly recommend this place.  If you're in Charlotte for any reason, do not pass go, stop and eat at Krazy Fish.  We started with the Green Thai Curry Mussels.  It was worth the trip for these alone.  They are phenominal!!!  20 mussels with slices of bread for sopping up the sauce.  The tastes go very well together.  My Dad and I then both had the Szechuan Salmon tacos.  These come on a soft tortilla shell which has been warmed on the grill so that they are \"puffy\".  The salmon is layered inside a sauce and then topped with a cucumber based slaw.  Out of this world.  My Dad can't eat cucumbers so they gave him a different slaw on the side.  Terry, our server, was very helpful and friendly.  Since we'd driven a distance for lunch, we also met the owner.   The service was very good.  The place is tastefully decorated like a fun neighborhood place.  We will be back.  The food was fantastic!",

It was a rustic, random set up meaning they had just a bunch of random souvenirs, paintings, replica, all kinds of cool interesting things around the place. We went on the best day possible, Tuesday. I took a picture of the menu. It explains itself. The food was delicious. These tacos were fully loaded and each taco was specially design with specific toppings to make it a tasty masterpiece. They seriously slayed on the tacos. I got four, Tuna, Bulgogi Beef, Southern Friend Fish, and the Glazed Salmon. Each one was bomb but my favorite out of what I got was the tuna because of the pineapple salsa .   I will definitely be coming back. My parents love the place too. They saw it on that show because they watch it all the time. You definitely won't be let down. The service was great as well. Everyone was nice and respectful. Awesome place.",

The Staff:  Much like the good very average, not rude but not helpful either.  They were attentive and no issues but it was just run of the mill.  The Place: Fun atmosphere, plenty of seating  The Drinks: decent beer list however would of loved to see more local option in the beer list .  Not bad just not anything special...if you are a triple D die hard maybe you can find something a little extra.",

My experience was \"decent\" at best and I tried quite a plethora of items. From the gumbo to the Green curry mussels, the Szechwan wings and the lemongrass curry, nothing stood out as memorable. The wings were dry yet soggy (how?) while the lemongrass curry was really curry chicken (or protein of choice) on a bed of coleslaw. Possibly the menu is catered to too many varieties of food (from tacos/burritos to southern comfort to Asian fusion?) and thus lack a specialty.   On a positive note, our waiter was amazing and I did appreciate the kitchen splitting the lemongrass curry into 2 sharing dishes.",

I ordered crab cakes with the corn along with veggies followed up with the special lobster bisque. The Bisque was AWESOME! At first glance it can be some what not appealing but the taste was amazing. The crab cakes weren't lump cakes but a good balance of filler and crab. The corn was a \"Mexican mix blend\" which wasn't anything special but still good. The vegetables had a bit too much minced garlic but cooked perfect. All and all I would say give me the crab cakes with a huge bowl of bisque . Yum!  My one friend had the special salmon cakes. Definitely had an Asian fusion blend to it. They were good but definitely had something different in my mind. She loved and raved about the squash casserole . Spicy! She also had the Mac n cheese which was good but not killer.  My other friend had the shrimp and curry potato cakes. The shrimp was delicious and I am not a curry fan so can't advise against anything more.  For an app we had the calamari . It was hot and oh so yummy.  Will definitely be going again!  I believe Tuesday through Friday from 4-6 you can get half priced tacos .... A good selection of different tacos available.   It's a must try! A little hidden treasure.",

    "text": "What do you get when you put a funky restaurant in one of Charlotte's hottest neighborhoods and fill it with the most random decorations and an ever changing menu... you get Krazy Fish.  On our waitress' recommendation we started off the night with an order of wings. When they came out ours eyes were like.. Whoa! and after the first bite our tastebuds had plenty of questions. They were juicy on the inside but kinda dry rubbed with spices on the outside. They were a little sweet, a little spicy, a lot of messy... and some of the best wings we've ever had the pleasure of demolishing. It didn't take us but a few short minutes to turn that gorgeous plate of wings into a pile of bones.  Next we got the Three Little Pigs BBQ Sandwich topped with slaw and blueberry tamarind chutney with some potato salad on the side. The potato salad was forgettable but the pulled pork and blueberry chutney was amazing. I'd suggest swapping out the bread for something less dense and overpowering but overall this dish gets a recommend :)  Ella ordered the Brisket tacos with cheddar cheese and salsa verde. The Brisket was tender and full of flavor, it was loaded with gooey cheddar cheese  and the salsa verde added the perfect hint of spice. The only thing this taco needed was a dallop of sour cream... perhaps a dallop of daisy. The black-eyed pea salad is probably one of the best we've ever come across and on our top ten list of favorite foodie menu items. The chipotle beef tacos were made with Korean bulgogi beef, topped with a salsa de arbol, and wrapped in corn tortillas.  Despite Krazy Fish not being a Mexican restaurant... the bulgogi beef tacos were probably some of the best we have ever sank our teeth into and the macaroni was oven baked and as fresh as homemade can get. The blackened tuna tacos came with an Asian slaw and were a little too blackened for Ella's palate but the slaw cooled it down a little and we still easily recommend it for the average person. The jalapeno cheddar cheese grits souffle was great... according to me, but Ella said she's had better.   We also got the southern fried fish wrapped in flour tortillas with a \"Pink Gold sauce\" and slaw. The fish was fried perfectly and was well balanced by the crunchy slaw. The best part of this taco though was the pink gold sauce, i just wished it had about a gallon more. Last but not least... the cuban chicken tacos with corn tortillas and salsa verde.  Not real heavy on the spicy cuban flavor but still enough to make us smile.  Its not often we get to add a restaurant to our favorites list.. but Krazy fish definitely deserves the honor. They have great food, a great staff, budget friendly pricing, and oh yeah... did we mention GREAT FOOD!!!!",

We started with calamari which was lightly breaded & tasty. We also got chips & salsa which comes with 3 different options. A standard chunky salsa that had good flavor but not enough heat, a salsa verde that I found pretty bland but my mom loved, & a pineapple salsa that I liked.  I had Cuban chicken tacos; nicely toasted tortillas, shredded seasoned chicken, salsa verde and their house slaw, which added a nice crunch & acidity to each bite. I liked them but I love spicy so I did add some hot sauce.  My mom got the pulled pork tacos that she loved, my dad the Szechwan salmon tacos which he found a little messy but good & my brother got the special lime salmon tacos that he also said were great.   Our server was friendly & helpful, gave us recommendations. Decor is fun and quirky, would definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte to try more off their big menu.",

    "text": "We've been to Krazy Fish a couple of times now and are always happy with our experience there. Firstly, the staff has always been super friendly and attentive with us and we have received great service. Secondly, the prices are incredibly reasonably for the quality of the food and the portions sizes. The beer prizes are even crazier; $1.50 mystery beer $3.50 Stella...!   Last time we were there we ordered the Thai green curry mussels for an appetizers and it was delicious! After we ate all the mussels and used every single piece of bread to soak up the sauce the waiter came over and was nice enough to offer us more bread, but we declined knowing that we would get too full for our entrees. I'm not ashamed to say that we finished the rest of the sauce that came with our mussels with a spoon as if it was soup! Both times I've gone I've ordered the Bulgogi beed roti burrito with thai red curry sauce and LOVED it. It has tons of flavor and the Bulgogi is always very tender. As far as sides go, my favorite is the jalapeno cheddar cheese grits, not exactly health food but it always make me very happy! Best part is that there is always extra to take home for round 2 later!   At the end, when you get your receipt there is always a credit at the bottom for next time. I believe it's a percentage of your final bill, our is usually about $5 and you can bring it in next time and they'll take that amount of your bill. You really can't beat the prices at this spot for a casual lunch or dinner!",

Every waiter we have had was spot on. The tall guy knew to bring extra napkins and kids food out immediately and another guy- Porter? is a fuckin' smooth operatin' dude that will keep the glasses full and offer any help you need with suggestions.

I'm a sucker for fish tacos but hate trying to go to Cabo Fish Taco for a couple of reasons (it's always crowded, the wait is crazy, and the price-point is way too high for what you're getting); so I found Krazy Fish when I typed in \"fish tacos Charlotte\" as an alternative a couple years ago and have loved it ever since.   My recommendation is the ceviche tacos - chopped white fish marinated and cooked in citrus flavors - and I always ask for the pineapple salsa to go with it because the flavors go so well together. Their jalapeno cheddar grits side is a must-try, too. Can't go wrong at this place.",

I typically get the pork tacos with their blueberry salsa and coleslaw. Their tortillas are always hot and fresh. I've been told they make them in house; I believe it. They're always airy and light. I also like their Krazy Rice as a side. I hate the name (it sounds like something you'd get at a kitschy rest area) but it's a sticky white rice with carrots and peas. Great flavor.   Overall Krazy Fish has some great and innovative dishes and they're always consistent. I will say their service is typically slow so be prepared to hang around a while. Enjoy!",

So when he told me that he found a place where he had good Chilean sea bass and a lobster tail for under $20, I was pretty skeptical. But naturally, I was prepared to give it a try.  So we went one evening in December around finals time. It was a cool spot. I wasn't really sure what to expect walking in. It wasn't a fancy place at all, but the decor had its own appeal and charm to it. It had a variety of streamers, lights and...well \"flair.\" Like it or not, it's definitely not something you see everyday. Plenty of seating, a cool tiki bar, clean, terrific and attentive service...not sure if there was any outdoor seating though.   But the highlight was the food. There were many cool options to choose from. They consider themselves soul seafood fusion and the menu options did not disappoint. The special was halibut with lobster tails and rice. Absolutely delicious. The best seafood that I've had in Charlotte. I also had to try the gumbo, because, well, I'm a fan of gumbo. And I'm now a fan of their gumbo. The meal was terrific and very reasonably priced. It was so great in fact, that I ordered shrimp and grits to go for my wife (who has to work late.) she was pleasantly surprised and loved it too! We can't wait to go back.",

Everything tasted like it was spiced with the exact same spice mix, and it wasn't a great one.    Maybe we'll give it another try one day, but I wouldn't recommend it now.",

Calfornia for many years I am a taco snob. Krazy Fish has the best poached shrimp tacos this side of the Mississippi. I hear the tempura ones are to die for as well. Last night I had the gazpacho soup which was packed with shrimp. This place doesn't skimp and the price is right. Go hungry, leave full and happy. Skip Cabo Fish Taco for Krazy Fish. Guaranteed that you'll go back soon.",

Like, oh, we have some fish sauce, taco spice, chicken, and dried mango - what can we make? Almost like the chef had heard about a cool, international dish and attempted to make it without using a recipe or tasting the results. My husband's salmon taco was decent, but my pho's flavors clashed so badly it was nigh on inedible and even my friend's fried food was overspiced.",

Very colorful personalities and unusual decor. If you like freakiness it is 5 stars. If not then 4 stars. While the food isn't 5-star - It is delicious. The menu is so random and so much to choose from and reasonable prices that it is 5  stars even though it is 4 star food.  We have brought our baby there, kids, grandparents -all have had fun and loved the food and the \"ambiance\" of randomness of everything and everyone there. Just expect it to be arsty and laid back and not anything like a white linen or a chain mentality. It is never the same experience twice. Awesome place.",

We waited 10-15 minutes and then the save guy who seated us comes over and asks if she's taken our drink order. My boyfriend says we're waiting for water. She then realizes she forgot our water. The guy comes back, with the waters, and takes our order. I start to tell him what I want and he gives me a dirty look and rolls his eyes saying that basically my decision was the wrong one and tells me that my food will be dry. I about had it with this place. I looked at my boyfriend and said, were leaving. And we walked out. Unless they teach their servers what customer service is, I won't be returning.",

The food was fine but the place seemed a bit dirty and our server found it necessary to sit with us and tell us her life's story  but being near the house and after a few drinks at home we decided to walk up. It was busy we had to wait for a table but that's fine not the restaurant's fault. When we were seated our server came got our drink order and took our order now it did take a while to get the food because they were packed but our server made sure our drinks were filled and after the food arrived it was great. The place seemed clean and the staff seemed attentive and let's face it that's half the battle. A place can have the best food around but if the service is bad I will not go back (zada James). I enjoyed the experience . Try the fried fish tacos and the mac and cheese",

    "text": "Krazy Fish is a unique and fun Plaza Midwood restaurant that opened just over a year ago in April 2011. The focus is on seafood and spice and the global menu includes a multitude of tacos, roti (flour tortillas stuffed with a protein of choice, rice and a chosen \"roti sauce\"), sandwiches and salads as well as entrees like fried seafood platters and shrimp and grits. The decor is quite entertaining including lots of nautical chotchkes that put you in the mind of a beachside seafood shack.  For lunch I was able to try both the special salmon taco - delicious with a tasty sauce - and the fried shrimp taco, which was also very good. The jalepeno cheddar cheese grits souffle was awesome and should not be missed. Many of the other side options look like great choices as well, especially the cactus salad which I didn't yet try. Service was friendly and fairly quick and our waiter steered us in the right direction with several recommendations. I look forward to returning to Krazy Fish to try more menu items - in particular the wings and the shrimp and grits. Also to note: every day tacos are half price from 4-6 PM - a great deal - and on Tuesdays bottles of wine are half-price as well.",

    "text": "I really debated on the number of stars I wanted to give this place. If I were basing it solely on one thing or another it might be different. First off we will talk about the food. We went in and sat at the bar and ordered the chips & salsa for an appetizer and they pick the different salsas for you. We got a pineapple, regular and the arbol salsa. The pineapple was good but not something I would normally dip chips into, the regular was really sweet but the arbol was my favorite. It tasted more like traditional salsa to me.  We ordered the veggie tacos to split with a side of the jalapeno grits. The grits were amazing. They were absolutely delicious. The tacos were also really delicious, the veggies are lightly battered and the taco had an almost asian inspired flavor as well. The only complaint I have about the food is that while I was eating my taco I noticed that something tasted off, I looked in it and there was a piece of a fish. I am a vegetarian who occasionally eats fish (like maybe 5 times a year) so luckily it wasn't that I was allergic but I was still deeply upset about the fact that there was fish in there. It seemed careless that that could happen especially considering that someone could be allergic to it. I do realize that this is a fish establishment but someone should be able to order veggie tacos without fear of getting fish in it. The second taco in the order that my husband was eating also had a small piece of fish in it as well.   The second factor for me was the atmosphere/service. We sat at the bar to eat since we weren't ordering much and didn't want to take up a table. The folks who worked there were very loud and didn't seem to care at all about what they talked about in front of the customers. There were several conversations happening that I wish I hadn't heard.  I would like to try eating here again as the flavors were really good but perhaps I will order out and see if I have any more issues with the food.",

The food however disappointed us.  My son had a burger which was incredibly dry.  For him to leave a burger half eaten told us something since he's usually a vacuum cleaner when it comes to food.  My wife's fish tacos were also really really dry.  Her squash casserole was really really bad.  I had a taste and needed to down it with water in order avoid gagging.  No joke.  My plate was fine but nothing great.  Not bad, but not great either.  I had a seafood creole platter.  All in all, I hate to say we probably wont be coming back for seconds.",

    "text": "This is my third review on fish tacos. I'm a snob when it comes to those.  I have been to Krazy Fish multiple times despite the food being just average.   Why do I keep coming here? Taco happy hour!  Every day between 4-6pm you can enjoy any of the tacos for half the price, which comes out to be an order of tacos and a side for $4. How can you resist that? It's cheaper than going to the grocery store and making tacos at home!   So I have had the ceviche, calamari, scallop, swordfish, chipotle beef (all in separate occasions). The scallop & swordfish are not on their regular menu. They were specials. Always watch out for those! As a ceviche connoisseur, it was disappointing. \"Blah\" is all I remember. As for the calamari, swordfish and  scallops, well... they all taste the same. Literally. \"Deep fried something topped with slaw and side of your choice\" is a pretty accurate description of what I have had here. It seems like their seafood by default deep fried which kills the flavor of the fish. Deep Sigh.  Their menu is huge. And I would even say, too big. Their offerings are all over the place - they have barbecue, chicken, beef, pho, gumbo, wings and the list goes on... What an identity crisis! I have to admit that the chicken and chipotle beef tacos that I have tried are better than the seafood ones.  Which makes me think that name \"Krazy Fish\" is misleading. It is definitely not a seafood place because otherwise the seafood dishes would be the best things in their menu. and they are not.   In sum, their food is alright. Good spot to visit for convenience. I don't think I would visit during non-happy  taco hours though.",

I checked Yelp and their website and discovered that they had great specials, 1/2 off of tacos from 4-6pm and drink specials as well. People also dished on their mac and cheese, and since my hubby is a mac and cheese connoisseur I figured we should grab an early dinner.   Well what can I say about the decor......its funky and looks like the things that Goodwill rejects. The server was very patient and friendly with good suggestions. She suggested that I get her fav which was the Blackened tuna with Asian slaw and pineapple salsa with the creamy cheese grits. I also ordered the pineapple mojito. My hubby ordered the southern fried fish roti with lemongrass curry and mac and cheese of course. She even brought out the sauce to sample before he ordered.   Well the Mojito was subpar and not much of a pineapple taste and the tuna tacos was good, but cold. Also The grits was luke warm as well. My hubby ate only half of the Roti but all of the mac and cheese!! He did enjoyed that.    Overall if you are looking for a deal on tacos, then go here, but I think that my quest for great fish tacos is still on!!!",

    "text": "Krazy Fish has a cool aesthetic going on... it reminds me a lot of a couple Outer Banks places, such as Goombay's or Tortuga's Lie. It's colorful, cluttered, and kinda fun.  The service was friendly. Somehow, I managed to spill my drink (apparently I reverted to childhood), but the waitress handled it with good humor. This is worth a couple points in my book.  Our meal took a little while to arrive, which seemed odd, given that we were having a late lunch and there were only a few other customers.  Once it did appear, however, it was satisfying. I ordered the salmon tacos, which were on special, and I demolished them in short order. Even more delicious was the jalapeno cheddar grits casserole. It was more like just grits than a casserole, but it was amazing. Thinking about it is making me crave another serving.  I hereby endorse Krazy Fish with 4 whole Yelp stars. It's good to know there's a relatively convenient place to get my fish taco fix. No more going to NoDa just to get 'tude from the Cabo staff.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, but I'm not sure that I can.  First of all, it's LOUD. We were meeting some friends there, and I walked in to see if there was a wait (and if so, put our names on the list). The hostess asked if she could help; I looked around and saw a few empty tables, so said \"no thanks, I'm meeting some friends\". She asked me to repeat myself, so I did. She still didn't hear me, so I repeated myself again. She asked yet again, so this time I almost screamed \"I\"M MEETING SOME FRIENDS AND WANTED TO SEE IF WE NEEDED TO PUT OUR NAME DOWN\". She then gave me an \"eat s--t\" look for (I suppose) \"yelling\" at her. If it wasn't so loud, I wouldn't need to say it four times.  Our waiter was super-friendly, but almost comically incompetent. He went around the table asking everyone for their drink orders. He told a joke to someone, then walked off without asking if I wanted anything. He walked by several times, oblivious to me trying to get his attention. He brought out the beers for the rest of the table, but never looked once in my direction. So I had to get up, walk to the bar and order the beer myself. I don't believe he ever even asked if it we wanted another round, either. So I guess you're only allowed one beer per meal at Krazy Fish. The old man would later bring our checks as five different checks (oh, I guess he COULD see me when it was time to pay the bill!). We were two couples and a friend; I guess he could have simply ASKED how wanted them separated, but no.  OK, so the service sucks... but how's the food? I got the fried shrimp tacos. They were tasty, save for the \"pink gold salsa\", which the menu describes as \"yogurt, honey, chipotle chilis and lime\". To me it tasted like yogurt, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, cane sugar juice, liquid glucose and hot fudge sauce. Yes, it was overwhelmingly sweet, like a shrimp taco liberally doused in liquid cotton candy. It was gross. The mac and cheese, supposedly some of the best in the city, was OK. Perhaps I've heard too much hype, but I can make significantly better mac and cheese at home myself.  I've been back a couple of times, and the experience was slightly better service wise, but I think this is the most overrated food in Charlotte.",

I ordered the mussels and they were disgusting and pink in color, which is common of mussels that have been previously FROZEN!!! I also ordered the mac and cheese and lets just say easy mac tastes way better. To top everything off, we experienced horrible service from the on staff \"manager\". When I explained the mussel situation to her, her response was, \" well what do you want me to do. Our mussels come to us already prepared, we just saute them.\" She said to me that she was not even sure why she was asked to come and speak to me regarding the matter, as she did not see a problem. I thought it was quite strange as well that on the menu, it states their policy, which is -if your food is cooked through, they will not issue any refunds-. WEIRD! GROSS! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! They heavily advertise chef and host of the show \"diners, drive-ins, and dives\", GUY FIERI. I am CERTAIN he would have been most disappointed in our experience as well.",

To the point I had to use the restroom minutes after (sorry, TMI; not sorry). Okay I did take out so maybe dinning experience would be different ... or maybe it should still be as great. I threw everything out after 5 bites and each bite was to try a bit of everything. I had the beef Krazy grill dinner. First of all, the worst grits I ever had, the cheese tasted so old that when I smelled it; it smelt like the cheese had been chillin under the bed for months, just disgusting I dont know how else to describe the grits. Mac n cheese? Terrible. They try to make it like a southern style with the crispy parts of it, gtfoh. Easy mac is better. What's next .. corn bread. Dry as hell. Bland. Basically pointless. I dont know what kind of fusion restaurant this is. Bulgolgi was too wet, try again. Gumbo wasn't bad though, I mean I still only gave it one bite but it was a lot better than the others. Out of everything, the grits had to be the worst. I'm all about giving 2nd chances, not this time. I was so pissed, I called my mother just to tell her about it.",

He allowed us to substitute a big bowl of queso for their queso and salsa sampler appetizer.  We basically filled up on the scrumptious cheese.  I had the shrimp tacos, which were very tasty.  The shrimp had just enough breading and was cooked through.  The squash casserole was not my favorite side though.  It was a bit spicy, even though the waiter assured me it would not be, and mushy as well.   The restaurant was quiet for a Friday night, which allowed for my friend and I to visit with each other.  The decor is very interesting to look at, with old toys hung up here and there.  It looks like Guy Fieri has stopped by this place too, which is pretty neat.",

One of my friends didn't like their side, and he switched it out with no problem. He also provided excellent recommendations!!   I went with my friends, and collectively we got the calamari as an appetizer. It was really good. Not too much batter, and the flavor was good.   I got the shrimp and grits. Their grits are jalapeno cheddar and they won an award in Charlotte for them. And they taste like they deserved it! It was really good and the peppers and slightly sweet (I think it was mango salsaish) was a nice twist.   My friends got the schezuan salmon tacos! AMAZING! The salmon was cooked perfectly. Sauce was great. It also had a vegetable blend on top. The portion was good even though you only get 2 tacos and a side. The tacos were pretty large.   My other friend ordered the something Willy poboy with fried shrimp and scallops. I didn't get to taste it, but it looked really good and she said it was good. It was pretty big too.  Definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "Why has it taken me so long to review Krazy Fish!? I guess it's in line with so many other reviews of mine where I wanted to pitch my opinion as best as possible for a place I think is so awesome. And that it certainly is.  Out-of-towners? This might be one of my favorite places to bring them. Especially if they're an out-of-countryer. This joint is so whacked-out. Think...remember the peyote cactus trip from the Beavis and Butthead movie? Yeah that. They've got some bizarre decor you really just have to see to believe. And outside they've done well to turn integral parts of cars into flower-like metal sculpture, a necessity to any tripper's garden.  But where their garden lacks in legit, earth-grown greenery their kitchen does not. Vegetarian or vegan you can find an option. Plenty of cilantro, plenty of tomatoes and peppers. That's just a start. Seafood tacos are the way to go. Any fish you can imagine they'll have it in here sometime as the daily special. Sea bass, scallops, tilapia, shrimp. Fry it, grill it, broil it. Then toss it with veggies into a taco shell and coat it with a house made sauce like the pink gold - yogurt based sweet & spicey - or the blueberry chutney, which pretty much speaks for itself in excellence. If you're looking for a real fusion southern favorite, stand firm with the jalapeno cheddar grits which might well be their biggest claim to fame.  Waitstaff is helpful and informative about the menu in general. In fact we were delighted with the friendly waitress who just plops right down beside you and guides you through the menu as if she were your new BFF. In reality I'm sure she just can't stand watching everybody else enjoy the food while she works. My only qualm is the location of Krazy Fish. Either Plaza Midwood needs to get to expanding down in their direction or Krazy Fish needs truck shop up beside all the goings-on. Imagine all the late-night Common Market drinkers that would wander in to binge!",

Shrimp and grits was super oily and had way too many pineapples in it, it stated it came with jumbo shrimp, NOT! It came with the super tiny frozen shrimp you buy from Wally World. And sorry, the cornbread was terrible.   The service was terrible, people walking around not doing anything, 1 guy working, three girls just walking around aimlessly.   Please take down the \"DDD\" poster in your restaurant, if you're not going to make the food like you did in the show, if you're going to cheap out, then don't claim it on your menu and on your wall.

Can we sit down first?? We asked to be seated at a booth instead and the big tan guy rushing us seemed annoyed. Too bad. Our server was really nice, but I think they were short-staffed, so she rushed through the specials. I forgot what they were! Anyway, we ordered the Shrimp Gazpacho. It came with a boatload of nice sized shrimp, probably U/15, really fresh and tortilla chips. I could've sworn they were supposed to be homemade, but they weren't. It was very good, nice and spicy, but it was a little too sweet, with orange I believe. They should've used more lemon instead. We then ordered the tacos. Now, mostly everything comes with their \"Krazy Slaw\" and my Sweet Chili Fried sea bass tacos were no exception. I wasn't aware that the slaw had cumin in it and although I like cumin, I don't want it in my fish tacos. The fish was good, just didn't like the taste. But they're HUGE! I should've split with Baldie, who got the Bulgogi tacos. I loved those, although they could've been more tender, but really good and they came with a diced cucumber salad on them. Great flavors. The tacos came with choice of a side. He got Mac and cheese, boring and just ok. But my jalapeno cheddar grits were outta this world! We'll def go back for dinner and try an entree. We weren't Krazy about it, but it definitely deserves another chance.",

Instantly when you walk in you're greeted by the smell of fresh seafood so be prepared to get a little fishy- however they do have two outdoor patios.   I always opt for their tacos with the jalapenos grits. One thing I love about them-They stuff the tacos!!!! They are huge! Plus, they always have delicious specials with my favs being the jalapeno grouper and the spicy pineapple Mahi. On the drinks end, they have $1 mystery beers and pretty cheap mixed drinks ($5-$7).   Overall, Krazy Fish is a great low-key place to try! If you're ever bored just come and check out their krazy decor inside and outside on the front patio! It's Krazzzzzy weird.   Ps. Some of their tacos get a little \"drippy\" because of the marinade the fish is cooked in. I recommend putting your tacos on a napkin and draining your taco before eating it so the shell doesn't break.",

I loved the artist approach , my daughter even stated it felt like she wasn't in Charlotte.   The food was just as interesting , I asked the server how the owners/cooks thought of the menu and specials bc they had a special \"kimchi Mahi\" . He stated the owners loved Asian cuisine, seafood , Spanish,  and Creole flavors so they had dishes inspired from what they experienced and enjoyed. I mean who doesn't love kimchi and Korean beef Bulgogi ;p . Since I can eat Korean anytime I ordered the Cuban chicken with a combo of yummy tofu, two sides , etc . View my yummy pics :)   Enjoy everything we ordered . I'll definitely be back , especially since the great service was the icing on the cake .",

The shrimp were uncleaned, the slaw was super dry, and the Mac and cheese was cold and bland. When I alerted the manager, she didn't do anything. She didn't fix the issue and listen to us, the paying customers. I've worked in food service in the past and know this is not the way restaurants should operate. I'm visiting from LA, and this restaurant is a poor representation of the Charlotte culinary scene.",

I had a hard time choosing what to order but ended up going with one of the specials that day, Mahi Kim Chi tacos with a side of Jalapeno grits. The flour tortillas are lightly fried and taste homemade. I can honestly say that the tortillas are the best I've ever had - ever. The fish was cooked just right and the Kim Chi added the right amount of kick to put this dish over the edge for me. Those on the fence for which side to get go with the Jalapeno grits - you won't be disappointed.   The ambiance is certainly eclectic to say the least. It's nothing that will prevent you from coming back but I found myself squinting and grinning multiple times as I looked around and the decor.  Is the artistic flair \"out there\"? Sure. But with food this good you can get away with it.",

The tofu was a little chewy but overall the flavor of the tacos were good. I ordered the mac and cheese to accompany the tacos which sounds like a weird chocie but I was craving some comfort food. It wasn't the best mac and cheese that I've ever had, but it did the trick. We also ordered the potato cakes which were filled with potatoes, peas, onions, and spices  pan-fried topped with Jamaican yellow curry and Krazy Slaw on the side. Overall the meal was ok. We sat outside on a beautiful night and had good service so that made it better. I'll have to try some other things on the menu next time I'm there.",

    "text": "Things are a-changin' at Krazy Fish...  We have been to Krazy Fish several times... in fact it was the first restaurant that we ever ate at in Charlotte.  The first couple of times that we went, the food was great and the service was... well, it was interesting.  There were long, weird waits between courses and just generally took a long time to get food.  It wasn't enough to keep us away, the Red Thai Curry is that good!    A few months ago we got a groupon and went back to use it (just the two of us using a $40 groupon).  We actually had a really hard time using the whole $40 on just two people.  This should give you an idea of the prices.  We had the mussels (amazing), a crab po boy (if you like that type of thing) and the Thai curry + we had to order dessert just to use up our groupon. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE!  We went to Krazy fish for, I dunno, maybe the 5th time (?) last weekend with some friends.  The patio was completely packed and there was no parking, but the inside of the restaurant was like a ghost town.  We sat out on the patio (we waited about 10 minutes) and upon sitting down I immediately noticed that their prices had gone up.  My favorite thai curry is now $17.95! That is a little steep, I think.  Also, my hubby was very underwhelmed by the portion size of his burger, which came with two spoonfuls of mac and cheese as a side.  I wish I could do an exact price breakdown of how much the prices have gone up but the menu on Krazy fish website isn't working...  but just to give you an idea:  Previous pricing: Mussels App Thai Curry Crab Po Boy Dessert =$40 (almost exactly) (This trip we brought home leftovers from all courses but dessert)  New pricing: Chicken wings App Thai Curry Very Sad Hamburger =$50 (This trip there were only leftovers of the Thai curry)  I really like Krazy Fish, but I honestly don't see us going back anytime soon.  It has just gotten a little too expensive for what it is.  To be fair, the Thai Curry is one of the most expensive menu items, but I am pretty sure it used to be only about $12...",

    "text": "mmmmnnnn.....Krazy Fish.  I must say, it's one of my favorite Fish Taco joints, and that's only a fraction of it.    I've had all the various assortments of Fish Tacos along with the Pork and Cuban Tacos.  The Flour Taco shell is so delicious and crisp, I could just eat that and be fine.  While I usually get some sort of fish, I opted for the pork on my last visit here.  Now, usually, I'm hungry within an hour of eating here but the pork tacos filled me up all night.   I think the various sauces that come with the tacos is what sets it apart from the other fish taco joints.  It's not just the standard white sauce.  The most common sauce is the Pink Gold sauce which is very tasty.  I was recently taken a back with the blueberry sauce on the Pork Tacos.  It's not something that I would have thought would work but it does, surprisingly.   I ordered the Mac'n Cheese as a side and it was just ok.  Nothing spectacular, a lot of goopy cheese.  I've tasted the jalapeno grits as well as the Squash Casserole.  I felt that the Casserole was bland and could have used a little spice and the grits were as you could expect, grits with Jalapenos.    I have heard that the Shrimp Gazpacho is awesome and it certainly looks that way.  It's huge!  As far as Apps go, we've had the Tempura Veggies and the Chips/Salsa with Queso.  The veggies were a nice change for an App but the Salsa lacked a lot of flavor.  They offered two types, Gringo and Hot.  I felt that the Gringo was way too mild and heavy on the tomato. The Hot salsa was more of a smoldering heat.  It took a minute to catch up with you.  However, the Queso was good, hard to ruin but you appreciate it when you've had bad Queso.  I hope to try more of the entrees next time like the Rotisserie Chicken but I'm always lured to the Tacos.....",

    "text": "Because of it's 4 star rating on Yelp, my husband and I decided to visit Krazy Fish tonight. It definitely looked a little krazy, and maybe slightly questionable upon pulling up, but we were greeted by smiling faces and great music once we stepped inside. The interior is fun and gives you plenty to look at while waiting for your food.   We started off with a watermelon margarita and sangria. The margarita was light, delicious, and not too overpowering in sweetness, but the sangria was average.  We also ordered the ceviche & chips appetizer with a light white fish and pico de gallo. It was fresh, and a fun alternative to the typical chips and salsa. We wish there had been just a little more ceviche to go with so many chips.  For entrees, we ordered the salmon tacos with bulgogi sauce and mahi mahi tacos with a cilantro butter sauce. Both came with two tacos, and they were large, especially for the price - in fact, I was full after eating just one, since we'd also had the appetizer. We both agreed that we would order each again. They were delicious! And from the looks of the menu, there are many more fun combinations to try. So many unique sauce and seafood options. Not only do they serve tacos, but also sandwiches, roti, and other chicken and seafood entrees. I should also mention that the cheddar jalapeno grits were the best I've had in a long time. Thick and flavorful!   Next time we'll save room for dessert - either bananas foster creme brulee or the orange peel brownie!  I've gotta say, after visiting Cabo Fish Taco once as well, I would return to Krazy Fish first!",

    "text": "We came here on 2 different nights for dinner.  The first time was a Monday night and ordered the fried seafood dinners.  I ordered the Neptune's platter and my boyfriend ordered the fried shrimp dinner.  One person at our table ordered the calamari appetizer, it was good.  Didn't think i had tried enough to write a review so I will say that the food and the service was pretty good on this night.  We had a very attentive waitress.  We decided to come back on a Friday night around 9:00 PM for dinner on the patio (patio was cute).  There were more patrons but I wouldn't say it was slammed.  The blackened catfish was great but these are the things that went wrong on our second visit:  - Once we were sat, We waited for 15 minutes before anyone helped us (party of 3).  Our waitress who had about 3 of the tables outside, from what we observed, took another 15 minutes to bring back our drinks.  She told us the $1 special was  Bud light lime.  One person ordered Bud light lime but was served Coors light instead and was told the $1 special changed since the order was placed.  Another person in our party ordered the red sangria.  I had a sip and it tasted like throw up (literally).  I was going to order the watermelon margarita, which  was another drink special, but after waiting 15 mins before the waitress came to help us I overheard the next table that ordered it said it was gross and they sent it back.   - After 10 more minutes she came to take our order without telling us about any of the specials.  After asking her to tell us the specials, I ordered the ribs special.  She came back to tell me that the kitchen was out of ribs but they didn't bother to inform her.  I got the catfish instead, which I would say was delicious.    - The calamari that we ordered for appetizer was soggy and didn't taste nearly as good as when we had it on our first visit.  - One of us ordered a cup of gumbo as an appetizer, which the waitress didn't bring out until we reminded her after our entrees came out.  The gumbo had really good seasoning but it had nothing in there besides dried bits of chicken.  I would have expected some okra and sausage at least.  - We had some issues with our bill.  The waitress didn't charge us enough and I didn't want her to have to come out of pocket so we waited another 10 - 15 minutes for her to come by.  We made eye contacts several times but she didn't bother to stop.  Therefore we left.  - It irritated me that the waitress only had a few tables that night but she obviously couldn't multitask.  She would walk back to the kitchen or bar after only helping one table at a time.    I will say that the food is good but the experience was terrible. After a second visit this restaurant seems very unorganized from the management down to the servers.  We noticed, what appeared to be, the two owners in the restaurant but one seemed to be worried about their Cinqo de Mayo party scheduled for the next day, and the other was preoccupied with what I would describe as sexually harassing one of the waitresses.(Which made the both of the women at our table VERY uncomfortable!!)  With so many restaurant options in the area we will probably not return.",

What to wear: a Hawaiian shirt or grass skirt.  $11 per person, no dessert, no alcohol, gratuity not included.  Former Pizza Hut converted into a funky, eclectic eatery and watering hole.  Dishes range from Caribbean to Vietnamese to Southern.  About my ratings:  Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.  Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):  1) fast food and \"fast-casual\" (no table service )  2) casual and \"polished casual\" dining (table service)  3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, typically more expensive than casual dining)  Fine dining can earn a max of five stars.  Casual dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars.",

I'll review Koishi and Moosehead later (if I haven't already)...  Krazy Fish is one of the places in CLT that we always take our out of town guests. We take our guests there for a number of reasons: 1) we like to show our friends and family Plaza Midwood and tell the story of the neighborhood's renaissance and how the residents helped to transform a neighborhood in decline into a truly vibrant community; 2) I love the atmosphere inside the restaurant ranging from the mannequin mermaid in the middle of the dining space to the sasquatch statue on the large round table near the bar; 3) the staff are fabulous -the waiters are all passionate about the food they serve, make great recommendations, and provide fabulous customer service; and 4) the food is absolutely out of this world! Who knew that Pan-Asian/South American/soul food could result in such an amazing fusion?!?! I have to admit I was skeptical the first time I read the menu, but oh my goodness- the fusion is pulled off what has to be divinely inspired fashion!  If you haven't been to Krazy Fish yet, do me a favor and go there. In addition to great food, they have a nice local beer collection; serve some really creative cocktails -including a mean bloody mary. Go, now... stop what you're doing and treat yourself to the best fusion restaurant in Charlotte!",

We started with the 'mystery beer' for $1.50 which was pretty fun and the beer was good--but they wouldn't tell us what it was after we drank and liked it. I didn't like that game any longer.   We got the Szechwan wings for an appetizer--very salty and a little bit too spicy for me, but the flavor was good. They served us the entire wing though, complete with the useless wing tip and everything, which was off-putting and uncomfortably messy.   The brisket tacos were quite good- the only part of the meal that was good all around.   Jalapeno grits were good, but no texture and no flavor kept me wanting more. (I actually like Flying Biscuit's grits more).   But the doozy on the whole night was our d-bag waiter. He misunderstood what I thought to be pretty easy instructions to split the appetizer between 2 people and he got it wrong. No big deal, happens to everyone. Except, he was really condescending  while trying to explain another way I should have asked. We left the restaurant saying, \"What a jackass!\" which is never the way a customer should leave a restaurant. Guess that whole \"customer's always right\" thing didn't really sink in.   I won't make an effort to go back here but it wasn't terrible.",

My side was the cheese jalapeno creamy grits and my partner had the Mac & Cheese. Both were very tasty but also our only complaint.

I remember the conversation I had with Adam and Peter and decided to roll on over. Got there around 4:45-5PM and it was pretty quiet.   I was seated immediately and looked over the menu... lots of fried items and \"not-so\" healthy items, but I did scope out the tuna tacos... YUM  I'm sold.   The tuna was grilled to perfection and the blackened spices were a little light for my taste, but not to worry they have tons of hot sauces. The slaw and pineapple salsa was refreshing. The tortilla was light and flaky as well. I ordered a side of limes as I love lime on my tacos.   I opted in for the jalapeno cheese grits... this was the first time I actually enjoyed grits since I've been here -- I did not finish them as I was afraid to think about how many calories they have, but I did enjoy what I ate.   I ordered a PBR to wash all this down.   Now this is no where near a Mexican restaurant, but what it is... is a might tasty meal! I will be back again for sure. Especially between 4-6 where I can enjoy 1/2 off tacos!   My bill came out to be $8 for all that food - what a freakin' deal! And the tuna was de-lish!   Thanks Krazy Fish... I think I'm a bit Krazy for your blackened tuna tacos!",

I had the cuban sandwich and it was great actually, a little on the dry side but nothing too bad.    The decor like a said is cool, but like and ecclectic cool, strange even.  I like that though and it kind of adds to the place.  We sat out on the patio which looked like it may have been under repair because of the loose construction material around.    Service was a little shakey with them forgeting that we need utensils and all around a tad bit slow but it sufficed.  I'll be back probably.",

    "text": "I really want to give this place 3.5 stars, but without that option, I will round up because I have great hope for Krazy Fish.   We went to eat dinner on a Sunday evening a little before 6 and there were a few people there. It got more crowded as we were there. We were immediately greeted and seated and our server was friendly, though everything seemed a bit disorganized. I'm sure that will get better with time.   The decor is a little tacky but it didn't turn me off. The booths are wooden and a bit splintery. It isn't a glamorous place but it will do.   The menu is kind of weird, as others have noted, but there are a lot of great options. I was glad to see vegetarian choices that didn't seem  like an afterthought. There's tofu, tempura veggies, potato cakes, and side dishes in an array of different combos.   We got the chips and salsa sampler to start. The menu says the salsas are \"chef's choice\" and we weren't told what we would get in advance. It came with a tomato, a green, and a banana salsa. The tomato and green were both good but the banana was really interesting. It was very spicy and the banana provided a good balance. I would definitely like to have that again.  For my entree I chose the tempura fish tacos. It is two tacos and choice of a side dish. The tacos come in a flour shell that has been lightly fried. Our server brought out a bottle of avocado sauce, which I really appreciated since I love avocados. The fish strips in the tacos had a good batter but were soggy from the yogurt sauce and the liquid from the slaw. The flavor was really good but I'll probably get the poached fish next time. I wish there was a blackened fish option. For my side I had the mac and cheese. It was good but the noodles were really soft and it had a bit of a kick to it.  My husband had the tempura shrimp bolillo and really loved it. The combination of flavors was great but be aware this is really spicy. The jalapenos had all the ribs and seeds attached. On the side he had the krazy slaw which is the same that comes on the tacos. It is a vinegar-based slaw.   I look forward to trying out many of the other options on the menu including the lemongrass tofu tacos and blueberry tamarind chutney. That sounds so intriguing.   They only had a few bottled beers this time but I heard a server mention that they will be getting drafts installed soon.    Also I want to point out that this restaurant has plenty of options for meat eaters who do not care for fish. Don't be turned off by the name if you don't like fish.",

    "text": "Awful. This was my second time at Krazy Fish-- it wasn't good the first time, but I'll give anything a second try.  The salsa trio + queso appetizer... one of the salsas (arbol tomatillo) had no taste whatsoever. Like slightly sweet water?... The red, classic salsa was OK-- hard to mess up a plain tomato-based salsa. The queso--SICK. Was like tasteless, cheap yogurt. It didn't even have the consistency of cheese, much less the flavor. It had NO flavor.  The King Neptune's platter-- lots of seafood, and then southern fried veggies. The shrimp and scallops were obviously frozen, not fresh. They were tiny-- the smallest I'd ever seed. The fish pieces were better, but there were only 3 small bites of fish. The veggies, which I was most excited about, were flavorless and burnt. No flavor left in them at all-- it was hard to even distinguish what they were. The tartar sauce?--must be made out of the same bland yogurt as the queso-- looked and tasted the same.  Banana pudding may have taken the top spot for WORST. It was literally brown, mushy bananas and box-made pudding. No vanilla wafters, no sort of biscuit or cake... Just a slop of processed pudding and old banana slices mixed in-- was probably made 5 days ago and just congealed.   Those were my meals, so I'll stop there. Everyone else complained about their meals too. Absolutely disgusting. We hardly touched our food-- after sending the queso back (I swear i never, ever send things back!), we figured it was a lost cause and didn't even bother taking home leftovers.",

We come back routinely for our same dishes we always get and last night had the same service that almost turned me away from this place the first time. Last nights food was also off so i felt like i was in the twilight zone and i was at Crazy Fish but i wasn't at the same time. Idk who reads these but check the schedule for who was closing last night on the 6th of Feb and i would do some re-evaluating on the kitchen staff and wait staff. The older woman looked lost while the little blonde was running circles around her...needless to say we had the lost looking waitress. Basically fire everyone from last nights crew except the blonde waitress and you will be back on track!",

Salsas were sub par, the grits aren't a souffle they are grits in a bowl, and the tacos didn't have much to help the homemade shells and well made fish along. A little pico de galo and some more attention to the details of their salsas would go a long way.  In addition their is a lack of Asian fusion. If anything they are southern fusion.",

They only thing i would stay away from is the steak.  My wife tried it once when it was on special and even though it was cooked well, it was very chewy.  I don't know if it was just a bad cut of meat or what, but stick with the tacos and you can't go wrong.  Also, make sure you get the jalapeno grits as your side...sooooo good!",

I could honestly care less about the decor, as for me it has no affect on the taste of my food. This time I ordered the brisket tacos, and a side of mac & cheese (again). Hot damn if that wasn't some surprisingly good brisket!! My only complaint would be the sauce that it was topped with was a little too peppery for my taste. Although I'm sure next time if I asked I could sub the sauce for a different one. They also really improved on the mac & cheese..so I guess maybe my first visit was on an off day.",

    "text": "Went to Krazy fish friday and thought it was pretty good all around!  The look is well, unusual but that's a lot of its charm!   The menu is large and varied ..anything from fish tacos, to curries, to Jamaican fare was found.  I ordered the ceviche tacos (although I had to ask what seafood was used in the ceviche - fish). They did not arrive with guacamole - so I asked for that and was given a squeeze bottle of something that resembled salsa verde more than any guacamole I've ever had. The taco would have been super awesome with real guac...while tasty with their odd version, I couldn't help being disappointed.  The server recommended the grits- side and being adventurous (yea I am from the North), I gave them a shot. They were pretty tasty but be prepared they packed a punch...which brings me to the margaritas. Very tart but refreshing- I had a little floaty in mine but drank it anyway since I am sure tequila killed whatever the heck that was.  Service was relaxed and friendly - owner seemed to be heated over the possibility of having to tear down his patio - as it was apparently too close to the road...so he went around getting emails for petitions. It was a bit like putting your customers on the spot but overall I didn't mind much as the man needed his patio !   I will definitely be back since I think Krazy fish can earn that 4th star - they certainly have the quirk and charm necessary to survive in this area!",

Asian, Southern, and MexiCali styles all fuse together in delightful ways. Mussels in a Thai coconut curry caught my eye on a black board as we walked in. So good!  And they give a generous amount of bread to soak up the delicious broth. Good, (and cheap) import and local beers and tasty margaritas. You can not go wrong with any of the tacos!  Szechuan Salmon was my favorite. Bulgogi Beef, Brisket, Southern Fried Shrimp, and Tuna are all home runs. If you have room for dessert you must have the creme brulee cheesecake, finished with bananas Foster and crumbled Nila wafers. Service was fantastic! The Krazy Fish is very casual, laid back place to visit and also a great value for money.  Needless to say I will be a regular.",

They had just put them on the menu because they weren't happy about the way they were coming out so we got the final result which in my opinion needs just a little more tweaking or maybe it was the sauce that threw me I'm not 100%...  I ordered the Shrimp Tacos and they were delicious! I loved the shell that they were served in and i also enjoyed the \"loose Guacamole\" on them! I had it with the gringo Salsa but it wasn't my favorite. The Slaw was vinegar based and pretty good too!   We finished with the Brownie that is overflowing out of a clementine shell it really takes on that orange flavor and was good.  Now the decor is definitely something to be talked about because it is so fun and obviously the reflection of the place and the owner!
