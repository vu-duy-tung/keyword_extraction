Had a friend visiting from out of town and our other friends wanted to meet up there it was my first and last time EVER there. I ordered a apple martini with absolut once it arrived it just tasted like apple sour I told the waitress I'm sorry I just didn't like it mind you I took a tiny sip so tiny it looked like I never drank it our waitress took it back and some lady said WE can't take it back all of our liquor is measured by five counts and I had to pay for it!!! WTF was that suppose to mean I just wanted my drink replaced and minus the lesson in drink Making I know how a martini should taste!!! So NEVER mind the customer was not satisfied I asked for the manager she said there wasn't one I gave her the 8.00 that she desperately needed we left and went to CHAR BAR 7 where the service was AWESOME!!!!! Sad when it's all about the count and not their customer you will NEVER get my friends or family money in your restaurant and the owner can thank the fake manager and horrible bartender on Saturday 11/18/16!!!!!",

    "text": "I am in search of the perfect pineapple pizza. And The Rusty Onion's pineapple ham pizza is absolutely scrumptious. The crust is so fluffy an compliments the cheesy cheese, tasty tomato sauce, yummy ham, and juicy pineapple deliciously. It's a great size because I had enough to enjoy for the next day's lunch. I've had about 10 non-chain pineapple pizzas in the last year and this one is at the top. Whenever someone asks me what a few of my top pizzas are, Rusty Onion is the first restaurant I mention.  The atmosphere is really cool because it used to be a car shop I think, so the garage door can open up on nice days. When I went, it was a delightful evening and we sat outside on the patio. There was chill live music also. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "First time here - no need to go back.  At all.  I don't know where to begin with my review! First of all, it was just me and my daughter for lunch.  The first thing I noticed was that EVERYTHING on the lunch menu was priced at $12 and up.  In order to keep our lunch tab below $25, we decided to order from the app menu.  Let me tell you first WHAT we ordered, and then I'll come back to HOW it tasted:  cheese fries and bacon bits, an order of SIX wings (yes, just six), one diet coke (that we split), and one piece of cake.  Total of our bill? $27.50.  I'm sorry, but come on!  The fries were laughable: they were simply fries with BACOS (the fake bacon that you shake out of a jar) and Cheez Wiz.  I swear.  Cheez Wiz.  The orange, gross, thick fake Cheez Wiz.  The wings were tiny - and they charged $7.00 for a plate of SIX wings.  To add insult to injury, there were shriveled, anemic looking carrots and celery as a \"side\" to the wings.  We tried to make up for our terrible lunch experience by ordering something called Chocolate Spoon Cake.  Again....a pretty tiny piece, which was really nothing more than a hard chunk of overly-sweet fudge - for $6.50.  Unbelievable.  I try not to give overly bad or mean reviews - I realize that all restaurants have bad days from time to time.  But this one really ticked me off, because the food quality was cheap and poor, and it was abundantly clear that this is one of the MANY, MANY, MANY Charlotte restaurants that thinks they can charge ridiculous prices because of the zip code - for below-adequate food.  (I mean come one....Cheez Wiz?)  Shameful.  I will definitely not go back - and would recommend to others that you not waste your money even trying it.  Overall, I think Yelpers in Charlotte need to raise their own personal bars - because I see lots of 3's and 4's (stars) restaurants on here - when my own experience with the restaurant is a 1 or 2 at best.",

Now they promote themselves as \"The Best NY style Pizza\" in Charlotte but it is much more than that. The menu is extensive with Pizza, sandwiches, salads and the traditional italian fare. I did have the Pizza special which was 2 giant slices, with everything on it, small salad and a drink for $8.95!  It was very good pizza and I took one slice home in a box. My friends all commented that the food was delicious, huge portions and they felt it Beat our regular spot for NY style Pizza. The other benefit was that it has tons of seating available, easy handicap access which was important to us, outdoor seating and an upbeat Hostess. One other benny was the Bar, they have like 50 beers and ales to choose from,  ain't nothing better than a good slice with your favorite beverage....we will be back soon cause I want to try the Sausage Stromboli....my bud said it was Great!",

I had my family there and we all ordered different things from the menu.   My pizza was bland as others had said in the early days of opening, but after I responded to the restaurant owner about what had happened, he and his staff were open to listen to what happened to me and quickly looked to correct the problem at hand.   I went back and got a pizza, and I have to tell you that it was Excellent. My test came when i finally had a chance to have the pizza, 1 hour after I picked it up... If a pie is good an hour later, you know IT'S GooD !....  Now, The owner is a family friend, and I am not writing this as a favor, but I have been honest with him since day one that I have known him... He honestly looks to make every patrons experience special...   I went back on my lunch hour last week, and had the Cheese Steak sandwich... It was really good... I think the mark of someone that wants to be proactive in his business is when after I was done, I was able to call him up and give him suggestions to make it even better... That's what Jimmy is capable of doing...  I look forward to many more nights dining @ the Rusty Onion as it continues to improve...   PS... 11 local NC Beers on Draft and how many more in bottles, makes for a great watering hole...",

I'm on a special diet right now which limits what I can eat (no fries onion rings ect.) I asked for a heathy side , fruit or something like that. The only item they offered was a salad at a 2.50 up charge. I asked what they charge for sides normally and was told 4.00 I was transferred 3 times finally speaking with a man who said he was the owner. I explained my diet situation and asked if in place of a side I could not eat if I could get a unsweet tea instead. ( cost to him probably a NICKLE) he went into this long story about food cost and would not accommodate a regular customer. I was pretty shock by his stance in a customer based business. I did not appreciate the treatment and did not order the 10.00 item I was planning on. So he loses a sales over a NICKLE item and LOSES a customer for now. Shame on you RUSTY ONION way to many options for this type of NON Customer Service. I'm sure they will be long gone soon. PM",

There were servers just sitting around at tables...we had to wait about 10 min for the bartender to show up and no one offered us a menu or a drink.  When the bartender did finally show up she stunk like cigarettes and had a very unprofessional appearance. She gave minimal service...

But when they saw it get a lot popular, they took the special off for the lunch crowd. I thought this was super shady and stop going. I recently went back and had the Salmon Caesar Salad special. Their Caesar salads used to be pretty good but this salad was a D at best. The cheese was grated so thick it was hard to chew and the salmon was bland and tasted frozen & served on the side of the salad, not actually a part of the salad. The wings used to be really good but i havent had them recently. This place used to be awesome but it has Def gone downhill. I do like the waitresses tho.

Last time, my sister and I ordered a Pineapple Upside Down shot. Keep in mind, this normally taste like sweet pineapple deliciousness.... ours however tasted like an odd combination of Butterscotch and ... well, just butterscotch. It was awful. We only took a tiny sip since the smell was so off in the beginning. I asked the server what in the world was in this shot because it did NOT taste right and I didn't want it. She asked what it taste like- I said Butterscotch. She went and asked the bartender what was in the shot (they had a long convo) and she finally came back and told me it had like vodka, pineapple juice, butterscotch liqueor and something else (it was random whatever it was). And then she immediately explained how they can't do anything about the shots if we don't like them, but I could order another one. Ummm, no thanks sweetie, if your bar puts butterscotch in shots like that, I don't think I will like the rest of your concoctions lol.  Maybe one day down the road, when I'm tired of all the other places around me and happen to get a coupon for this place, I may go back... but only for pizza.",

They might have had a rough start, but they definitely had their stuff together for the dinner rush.   We got there and saw a couple of chairs open at the bar and decided to head over there. As soon as we sat down the bartender came over, introduced herself and asked what we would like to drink and if we needed menus.   We ordered our appetizer while we sipped on our first beer - they have a nice selection to choose from by the way. When we got The Rusty Onion, we dug right in. It was a GREAT start to our meal. The caramelized onions, pita chips and sauce are a perfect combination, with just the right amount of spice. Shortly after getting our appetizer, we decided to go ahead and put in our dinner order.  We couldn't choose just one pie, so we got two personal sized (10\") pies - The Eye-talian Stallion and the Cheeseburger Dy-no-mite. I have been thinking of coming up with my own Italian sub-style pizza, before I really had the chance to do it on my own, BOOM! I find it at The Rusty Onion. The Eye-talian Stallion is exactly what I had in mind, plus some. The Kalamata olives and artichokes really make this pizza pop. The Cheeseburger Dy-no-mite is the perfect compromise if you can't decide whether you want a pizza or a burger, and it even comes complete with their special sauce drizzled over freshly-shredded lettuce. We couldn't have been happier with the choices we made.  The food all came out hot and timely. Our bartender was very attentive, without being intrusive to our evening, and we ended up staying for a few more rounds than we had planned.  This place is a must to put on your list of places to try. I am looking forward to trying out more items from their menu.",

The tempura mushroom batter appetizer is delicious too. We also devoured the Canolis...mmmm. And oh yeah...The craft beer selection alone is worth coming out for by itself. The beer comes out at the perfect temperature for enjoying this kind of quality.

The greeter was friendly and the server was attentive.  The problem was the food.  The French fries were very under cooked and greasy, no salt.  The garlic nots were missing garlic and were relatively greasy and under cooked also.  The marinara dipping sauce was fairly tasty.  My friends Philly cheesesteak was very greasy with very few onions and peppers on it.  She did find one mushroom.  I ordered the Italian sub with no onions.  After picking the onions off my sandwich I found the meats terribly dry and the vinaigrette dressing seemed to be missing until the very last few bite of the first half of the sub where I found the bread soaked in balsamic vinegar.  The server apologized and the manager came over and apologized also.  He did want to know what the food issues were,, hopefully so he could correct them.   Our food was free and he gave us a coupon for future use.  I really appreciate his concern and graciousness and I wish him luck in the future but if he doesn't get his kitchen straightened out, I believe his restaurant will be short lived.",

Inside there's an artistic heat/cool vent and the place is decorated with warm \"rusty\" colors.  The caramelized onions and cheese appetizer on grilled pita was to die for.  We were very impressed with these two superb menuitems.  Our family members were equally pleased. We've eaten at many South Charlotte pizza places.  Nothing beats their food here. I'm not a beer drinker, but my husband is.  There's a large selection on draft of craft beers from Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro and other locales. Don't miss this place.",

Had The Rusty Onion appetizer, fried/baked flatbread pieces, with a thick dipping mixture and marinated onions, both in very small containers hooked to the basket of bread. Not very good, bread overdone, difficult to get both sides on it, and neither side all that good. Also got the Buffalo Wings, which only come in HOT, although they do offer other types of wings aside from Buffalo style. They were very hot, but did have some flavor. Unfortunately, the wings right around the corner in the same plaza, at Flip N Chicken, are much better, and less money. I then ordered a main course, the Meatball Ravioli. 30 minutes later, without anyone ever serving me the ravioli, I got up, left a $20 to cover what I had eaten, and left. Very disappointing and I won't be back, nor will the people who were depending on my advance scouting to see if they wanted to try it. Not impressed with the menu variety at all. Carmela's Pizza, the restaurant that used to occupy that space, had great pizza and wings. Too bad they are no longer there.",

Menu was typical bar food with what looked to be good pizza. Might go back for the pie.",

    "text": "We are back! This visit was much better than the last time. While my husband and I enjoyed our food and drinks, my brother and his girlfriend had a rougher night with their orders. There was a new bartender who was struggling to make a decent mojito and they volunteered to be her guinea pigs. After 3 attempts, though, they switched to beer. The manager took the mojitos off of their bill. She made a tasty cherry rum and coke, though. A little too much ice, but she's learning. Next came the food. They ordered the cheeseburger dynamite pizza and did not enjoy it. They tried to play it off while being honest with our waitress. Soon after, a manager came over and insisted they order another pizza or sandwich because he \"wouldn't let them \"eave with a bad taste in their mouths\".  While tonight was an off-night for half of our table, the service was amazing. It blew us away.   Our server's name was Sheldon and I highly recommend her. She was a lot of fun and handled everything really well while still having fun with us.   Summary: amazing service, food was a large improvement over last time, and we will definitely be back.",

Now, I know what you're thinking, that a Mac and Cheese pizza is going to be some bar food hastily tossed together because people love mac and cheese, but this stuff is legit.  The sauce is creamy and awesome, and it's just covered edge to edge in melted cheese.  Is it good for you?  No, it is not, but you should have known that from its name.  You're not here to eat healthy.  You're here to eat a pizza covered in macaroni and cheese.  You will not regret it.",

    "text": "We decided to give this place another try since we are so close, but this time we were there for lunch.  Kevin got the wings - half Italian, half buffalo.  This is the only reason I'm giving this 1 star, the wings were half decent, so I'm being generous with the star.  Italian was nothing like I've had, they were good! Buffalo were too spicy, and I usually get hot on wings, still good flavor.  I got the philly steak with onions, mushrooms, peppers, and provalone cheese. Huge disappointment, with all of those flavors, it was highly bland.  There was absolutely no flavor to the beef, reminded me of frozen shaved beef I can buy at the grocery store.  Service was annoying this time.  Maybe it was because they weren't busy, but the server was slow with her 4 tables and the hostess was helping out, so both checking on us.  Example: food arrives from bartender, she asks what we need, and we are good to go.  Server comes over and says well that looks yummy, I'll let you eat and I'll check on you later.  Eat a few bites, hostess comes by and checks on how things are going. Moments later server comes back and checks on us.  Moments later as we are still eating, server comes back and asks us about dessert, once we say no she goes away and comes back with check.  Really?? Chill out and let us enjoy our bland food.  I'm done giving this place a try.  Go to the other restaurants in this shopping center, they are 5 times better.",

We were the only ones there (it was only 11am) so the service was very fast. The beer selection looked good. I say looked because work frowns on me drinking on the clock.   Nothing extraordinary but definitely a nice spot to grab some pizza or watch the game.",

It's a tart cherry flavor with a decent alcohol content so be careful!  Get the Tuscany bread it will not dissapoint you. Really the only thing that would is the calamari-- just not impressive....",

I ended up peeling off most of it but the dip was really good!  The chicken wings, were great! The sauce was delicious too! I'm even pretty certain the ranch that came with the celery was house made.  We got take out and I think we were the only ones. The place was pretty full with people dining in.

The pizza options were awesome....there are a bunch on their menu I can't wait to try.  I ordered the cheeseburger pizza this time - it was good.    Our main problem was the appetizer we ordered was nothing like how it was described on the menu.....it was missing the spinach and pesto, plus they added salsa to the bread instead of bruschetta, yuck!   But after bringing it to the manager's attention, they fixed this and brought us a new one.  I would think that they would have removed this item from our bill, but it was still on there.",

The bathrooms are clean.  Plenty of patio seating, but we chose to sit inside.

I like that it was different from the usual fried pickles appetizer and the aioli was yummy.  As my entree I ordered the portabella pie. I was expecting a large portion, as it was listed under entrees, and the description made it sound like a portabella cap stuffed, much like a stuffed mushroom appetizer that I am familiar with. However, when the plate arrived, it was a bit smaller than anticipated. I was glad that I had a salad to help fill me up. The taste was great, so if you are interested in a smaller dinner, this is a good option.   My group ordered drinks, and they came out mostly okay - we had a few mix ups that perhaps could have been avoided. For example, I ordered white wine and my friend across the table ordered champagne. But the servers brought out 2 glasses of white wine. When I got my check, there was a drink on there that I hadn't ordered. I know we all get mixed up sometimes, but taking care of the little details would have made our experience more enjoyable.",

We asked to send them back almost immediately, but they made us pay for it anyways bc \"all the water came from the ice.\" This means that they either let them sit there too long or they just have really watery and terrible mix. So yeah, we ended up paying $8 a pop for something we didn't like or drink.   We also got pizza. He got the Greek, I got shroomin fun guy. They were pretty good.   Our server was nice. Just wish he could have taken the drinks off the bill.",

    "text": "Did a small taste testing for lunch today to get a feel for the menu. Had the Buffalo wings, which only came in Hot (no less spicy options) which I think is a mistake. Good flavor, but Flip N Chicken, in the same shopping center has better and more options. However, while hot as promised, pretty good if too hot for most people (in my opinion). Then had The Rusty Onion appetizer, which wasn't very good. Flatbread chips, and a small amount of dip with another small serving of Carmelites onions. Perhaps if served differently I might like it better, but as is, disjointed and difficult to combine the three ingredients. if this is a Signature piece, it needs to be revised considerably. Finally, ordered the Meatball Ravioli, waited 30 minutes, never came. Left $20 to cover what I ate and left. Not very promising, won't be back.",

One of the best things I can say about this place was when you couldn't get wings ANYWHERE else in town on Super Bowl Sunday, The Rusty Onion had my back! I picked up an order of 50 wings which were great and didn't have to tough any crazy crowds!  If you are looking for a solid choice for dinner give this place a try you shouldn't be let down.",

We sat at the bar for a couple drafts and to share a pizza. They have a good selection of Charlotte & NC beers at a great price, score! We started with the Greek Salad - it was really big and the dressing and ingredients were A-OK (except for the dried cranberries, that threw me off). For our pizza, we shared the Great Balls of Fire - a meatball pizza with tomatoes and red peppers. We ordered ours with banana peppers instead. All-in-all the ingredients were fresh, but everything about it was just bland. Almost like the dough needed some salt or something?   The bartenders were fairly \"green\" but they did check on us, we just got the vibe that the restaurant hired a lot of inexperienced people.  Overall, we liked the Rusty Onion, but I doubt we'll be back. Definitely not my favorite pizza in Charlotte.",

Upon arrival the host greeted and sat is immediately. It was not busy maybe 8 tables occupied in total.   Good sign so far.  About 2mins a waitress came and took our order.  We just wanted aan appetizer and 12 wings. The drinks came fast.. I ordered a martini which was delish! My husband a beer.   Then we waited 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins .. during this time 3 to 4 more tables were seated. 20 mins , still waiting on our little 12 wings. Waitress finally stops by and said, \"let me go check on your wing order\". I said thanks.. 28 mins still waiting for our wings but the other tables now have drinks and appetizers.  30mins my husband said, \"let's pay and leave,  this is ridiculous\". I found the waitress asked for the check.  She said, \"your wings are coming the ticket got lost\". Thank you,  but it's, now 35mins of waiting,  no thank you.  We paid her. As we reached the door she came out with wings saying they're ready now.  I just turned and we left.  Maybe this was just an off night.  I don't know.  But unsure if we'll visit again.",

For instance, their chicken penne is outstanding. It comes in a nice Gorgonzola sauce. The salads, particularly the Greek salad, are fresh and have great dressing. The owners/managers appear to be a family, and are always warm and helpful when I call. Overall, complete package, this is the best pizza place in the area around Park Crossing or South Charlotte.",

    "text": "Well, I thought this would be a good go to pizza place WITH MY DOG... who I bring everywhere with me.  This rusty onion place is a NO DOGS ALLOWED/NON-DOG friendly business.  So no service for my dog, then no service for me nor my business.  Ever.  The shopping center has a multitude of restaurants nestled within it and EVERY restaurant is DOG FRIENDLY.  There is a Mexican restaurant on the corner... DOG FRIENDLY.  There is an awesome Chinese restaurant, DOG FRIENDLY!  This pizza joint is literally 50 feet away from the others with no difference in ordinance restrictions, so it's a personal business choice, yet when I came to sit with my 7lb dog in a carrier on a chair, which no one even knew she was there, the owner, Jimmy, apparently was informed by his hostess that there was a DOG on the patio, he mosied around to try and find the dog, and had to do a search because she was so tiny, completely quiet and wasn't moving in her carrier on a seat where we were seated literally on the sidewalk next to the patio fenceing enclosure.  Finally, after having to look everywhere BECAUSE she was undetectable, finally sees her after poking his head around in and around every direction, sees her and says to me \"I'm sorry, no dogs allowed.\"  I looked at him with complete surprise.  He proceeded to say, well........you can sit on the OTHER patio on the other side (which isn't really a patio, it's a smoking/break section where the employees take breaks, etc next to the kitchen where no patron would sit).  Sooooo....we're not good enough to sit in the regular front patio because we're with a dog, but we can sit among your employees working and taking breaks, etc, so you can still take my money of course.  RUDE.  This is 2019.  Humans are really starting to realize how important [our] animals are, and they are family and we take them everywhere with us.  You're either going to get on that train and realize that if you continue with that old school mentality that dogs aren't allowed, you're going to lose a lot of business.  Charlotte has started to take notice of this and businesses are beginning to realize how important it is for us to include our dogs in our social activities and day to day lives and become dog friendly.  We work our asses off all week and when we want to relax, we take our dogs with us since they're stuck at home all week waiting for that interaction.  They are family.  I will never recommend this place to anyone.  I believe in being very fair and I give credit where credit is due in my reviews and I love to recommend a great place to dine to anyone who inquires, so when I find one, I go above and beyond to those people who don't know an area, but when I've had an experience where something such as this is completely unnecessary and such an antiquated point of view, it's the complete opposite for me.  Even if there was an isolated reason/incident possibly that happened for this rule to be enacted here, why punish everyone else and also lose business as a result of it.  I don't have time for this discrimination and will enjoy my time everywhere else in Pineville with my dog.  How about Char Bar 7 that has a completely ENCLOSED patio with a fireplace, couches, wide screen TVs everywhere on their patio, AMAZING food and flatbread, awesome waitstaff and manager, the BEST fried pickle spears you've ever had, the BEST bartender in town and gorgeous landscaping around it to look at, and DOGS ARE WELCOMED!!  THANKS Jimmy for turning me away, because I realize how much I miss when I don't go to Char Bar and/or any other patio in Pineville.  Oh, and Mellow Mushroom about 3 miles down the street has amazing pizza and atmosphere too, with a patio where dogs are absolutely welcomed!  There are lots of other options.  Or I can go to The Great Wall of China that ALLOWS and WELCOMES DOGS next door to rusty onion (who doesn't allow dogs) WITH my dog on their patio... or possibly Cabo's amazing Mexican food that ALLOWS AND WELCOMES DOGS also next door to rusty onion (that doesn't allow dogs)!  They BOTH have awesome food!",

Awesome customer service- friendly hostess, server was attentive and friendly as well.  We ordered two appetizers - the Rusty Onion (yum!) And cheesy fries (daughter's favorite!) And two slices of cheese pizza off the lunch special.  We love carmelized onions so the Rusty Onion was a hit right off the bat, the pita bread and spread together was good enough to eat as a meal.  We plan on getting that again.  Pizza was good, had a nice herby frangrance, thin crust and not too much sauce - nicely balanced pie.  Cheese fries- can't go wrong either.  So add up great customer service, delicious food, good prices- we'll be coming back.  We already have a list of what we want to try next time!!!",

The first few times it was frustrating because we went well over our allotted one-hour lunch time due to the fact they are typically pretty busy for lunch - especially on any given Friday.  After a few conversations with the owner, who knew other folks from our dealership, clued us in on an easier process. We now call ahead as soon as we leave - typically always sticking with the one slice o' pie, side salad and cold beverage lunch special - it will be arriving to our table about the same time we are. Bravo! Now that's a well done work lunch.  Speaking of the aforementioned lunch special: damn, that's tasty! Every day they pick a different specialty pie and then you pick a caesar or garden salad and your choice of soda or tea. Last step: Enjoy! Simple as that.  BeeTeeDubs: I have yet to spot a rusty onion on any of my pies...  Don't forget the good beer specials throughout the month as well... Saluti!",

After reading several reviews we were a little hesitant to try it but chalked those poor reviews up to grand opening jitters. I'm glad we tried it out. I'm pretty sure the owner of the restaurant held the door open for us and welcomed us in. We were promptly seated and greeted but our super sweet waitress. We ordered a large pizza half mac & cheese and the other half Philly Cheesesteak. I really enjoyed my half of the mac & cheese. It was very flavorful and delicious. My husband enjoyed his Philly but suggested adding some A1 sauce.  The music was fun, the restaurant was clean and looked really nice, and service was great. I will definitely return!",

My boyfriend got the Great Balls of Fire pizza, and thought it was good but wanted more meatballs on it, or bigger pieces of meatball. I got the Shroomin Fun Guy pizza which I thought was the best pizza I have had in years!!  Carmelized onions, goat cheese, arugula, mushrooms. They top it with white truffle oil, and they don't skimp on it like most places do. The flavors of this pizza are amazing. The service was attentive and the manager(?) also came and checked on us, too. Oh - and we took home a (homemade) meatball sub for my daughter and all agreed it was VERY good. We will definitely be frequenting this great neighborhood restaurant!",

We also ordered a standard cheese pizza, which was so- so. For the price, it has to be better. When they talk about how unique they are in the marketing materials, they must not be referring to their pizza (although I guess the cheeseburger pizza was uniquely disgusting- perhaps they mean that).

The live music is WAY too loud. We don't come here very often because of the music.  It is so loud you can't talk to the person next to you. Please Please stop the music! ! Your restaurant would be so much nicer!",

    "text": "I live within walking distance and have been wanting to walk over with my two dogs since they supposedly have a dog-friendly patio as it states in a post on their Facebook page back in June when they were determining the patio status. So, yesterday me with my two small dogs and a friend with his dog walked over to sit on the patio and have a few beers. Well, they are not dog-friendly on the patio to our disappointment, which is the only reason we tried the restaurant. We agreed to tether our dogs to the fence railing right outside the patio gate and sit at the table right by the gate. All was OK and we decided to try the pizza. Before finishing, the manager (I think) who allowed us to tether the dogs by the gate entry to the patio came out and said the owner was in and very upset about the dogs. Anyway, long story short...  The beer selection is awesome. Our service was wonderful -- Victoria. The pizza was fairly good but too pricey for what it is. ($22.50 for a 16\" specialty pizza, for example)  I doubt we patronize the restaurant much more because the attractive feature for us was the dog-friendly patio. It's a shame as there are many responsible dog owners in the area who would walk over and enjoy the patio.  Dec. 11, 2013: Decided to try this restaurant again. I was pleased to see they have brought the insanely high former specialty pizza prices down to a reasonable level of 10\" $10, 14\" $14, 18\" $18...and it's nice to have three size choices now instead of only 10\" and 16\". It was also nice they allowed me to do a half and half pizza choice on a 14\" to try two of their specialties.  I would still go here far more often if they were dog-friendly on the patio. The Mexican restaurant a few doors down allows dogs on their patio so they get most of my business in the area. I got various reasons at The Rusty Onion of why they changed their dog-friendly policy with one person saying any restaurant that serves food cannot allow dogs on the patio. Completely False, as I told him. There's a plethora of restaurants in Charlotte that allow dogs with their owners -- that's good business and definitely brings in more money for the proprietor!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bringfido.com%2Frestaurant%2Fcity%2Fcharlotte_nc_us%2F&s=e85e7d326b103712381567a2672fcfc9ed1791e4a06fa9e9255fd3582bd973db\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bringfido.com/restaurant...</a>",

    "text": "This place gets 2 stars only because they have a great beer list - otherwise forget it. We ordered a pizza and salad. The food was mediocre at best. And where on this earth are you CHARGED for cheese on a pizza, as if it's a topping and not an essential part of pizza! Since all you get for the base price is dough and sauce, it gets pretty expensive pretty fast when you add toppings at $.75 -$1.25 each. The sauce had no spices whatsoever; no oregano, no basil, no pepper - just tomato sauce. Could have been canned Hunt's' tomato sauce. Really??  We got pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and fresh mozzarella (we ordered mozzarella, they chose to put the more expensive fresh mozzarella on it) - it was all BLAND! Onions had no flavor and even the pepperoni lacked punch. The mushrooms were from a CAN!! Get real folks!   Ditto the salad. Lots of different greens, tomato, onion, cheese - how can you make that turn out flavorless? They just have a knack for sucking the flavor out of good food I guess.  One 10\" pizza, one side salad, 1 beer, 1 glass of wine  -  $36.53. Too pricey for me.  One other thing: they have lots of TVs so if you like sports bars....however, they had ALL of them on LOUD and not all the same game. Impossible to eat inside if you want conversation. Service isn't great either.  Won't go back & will caution others to stay away. Too bad because with a little tweaking and a chef with culinary skills it could be a good place.",

    "text": "My husband and I live right across the street, and after months of driving by and commenting how we should try the Rusty Onion, we finally pulled the trigger last night! We split the Rusty Onion app, he got the Eye-talian sandwich with fries, and I got the Portobello Pie with the house salad (also came with bread). I loved my meal- it was unique, delicious, and filling! He loved the fried but wasn't crazy about the sandwich- said it was salty but it could have been because of the Italian meats which can tend to be salty. The app was delicious- sauteed onions and a garlicky cream sauce over toasted pita bread- I could have eaten that pita bread all night! Yum. Overall we left happy and are planning to go back to try more of their menu. The total for our meal was $38 including tip.",

My boss went earlier this afternoon and was astonished by how good of a time he had there (after about 3-4 of his own terrible lunch trips to The Rusty Onion), and he recommended that I try it. He was so certain that my experience would be a good one that he said he would pay for my meal if it went otherwise.  My server was Cory and she was well versed in the specials and was very sweet. Eric and the hostess came by a few times to make sure that my food was good as well. Overall, the service was EXCELLENT! The food was delicious as well! I finally had the experience I had hoped for since they first opened. Can't wait to try the gluten free pizza next time. If you've had a bad experience at this restaurant, I definitely recommend giving it a second try.",

    "text": "So, I really want to LOVE this place.  Unfortunately, I don't.  My husband and I have been here twice.  Once for drinks, another time dinner and beers.      Let's start with the positives (and why I will be going back and giving it another try):   1.  The beer selection is great.  They have so many local craft brews on tap, it's wonderful!  With that said, there are a few places in the area with an equally great, or better, beer selection (Duckworth's, Mellow Mushroom) and better food.   2.  The decor inside is awesome.  They have these really cool lampshades that are painted with the local Charlotte Brewery's logos.  They are very cool.   3.  The staff is very friendly, maybe a little too friendly.  While nice is great, my husband, our friend and I must have been interrupted no less than 15 times during our dinner by various people asking us if everything was OK.  That said, it was their second week open and I understand being overstaffed and it's your new job.  If the manager tells you to go around and check on tables, that's what you do, but it was overkill. 4.  The onion rings were yummy.  Now the not so great: 1.  As mentioned above: Too many people interrupting our meal. 2.  Single bathroom.  I know this may be out of the owner's control, but I hate when a bar/restaurant has just one bathroom.  This means you are always, more often than not, waiting outside.  Waiting outside at this place means waiting in a narrow hallway where servers are coming in and out of the kitchen, it's just awkward. 3.  Our food was not good.  They are a pizzeria, we had two separate servers tell us that the cheeseburger pizza tastes, \"Just like a Big Mac\".  It didn't.  It was flavorless and the crust was not fantastic.  For me, the crust makes the pizza...this was blah.  With all of that said, my husband and I will go back.  I will try something other than their pizza.  Our friend said their pasta was good.  I hope to give a more positive update after our next trip!",

    "text": "Do you giggle like a 16 year old boy every time you see/hear The Rusty Onion?  I know I do.  I am not sure why it sounds like it belongs in a dirty joke, but whatever.   I had seen varying reviews on Yelp, knew it was a new place to try and I needed to get fuel at the Exxon near it, so I figured I might as well try it out.  Located in the pretty recently renovated Carmel Commons shopping center, on the Carmel Rd side near Great Wall of China South, the signage makes it pretty easy to spot.  At 5:30 on a Wednesday night, the eating crowd was light, but the bar was about half-full.  Several large TV's were in various places.  The restaurant has wooden tables chairs, high top tables with wooden chairs and seating at the bar.  They also had several iron tables and chairs on the patio, but July in Charlotte isn't always prime outdoor seating.  I also noticed that there is a big roll up door at the front of the restaurant - maybe for some fresh air when it gets cooler and doesn't rain every stinking day.  It was a nice looking place (I have never been to this location in any of it's previous iterations), but as with every new restaurant I have been to recently, it has finished concrete floors and an open ceiling which makes it LOUD - I mean deafening loud (which could be a sign I am getting old).  There were 3 tables seated and maybe a dozen people at the bar and I couldn't hear myself think.  I could only imagine on a night full of drunks and/or kids - eesh.    I had looked at the menu online prior to going and knew I wasn't going to pay $7 for 6 wings.  From another review, the app The Rusty Onion didn't seem to be worth the price either (though their apps were priced for what the going rate of most are around town).  Salads and sandwiches seemed to be reasonably priced.  Specialty pizzas are $13.50 for a 10\" or $22.50 for a 16\" (which made me cringe, that is higher than I have seen at Hawthorne's, Libretto's, etc.).  I wasn't terribly hungry, so I just went with a build-your-own pizza which starts at $9.50 and then sky-rockets per topping from there.  I just got a plain old white/garlic & EVOO sauce with mozzarella on it.   The pizza crust was fantastic!  The last two pizzas I have had from other places (white pizzas, I like white pizzas, less indigestion...) seemed to be the new standard of a crust that tastes burned.  I don't like that.  This crust was substantial, just slightly thicker than thin, with a good bite/crunch to it that held up well to the very last bite with no flop at all.  I was a big fan of the pizza and would gladly go back to try more.  For a basic build-your-own cheese pizza (no toppings) and water to drink, my tab was just over $10.  The service was fine, I had no issue with waiting an inordinate amount of time for my pizza at 5:30 - it actually got to the table pretty darn fast and it was smoking hot.  My water was kept filled and my waitress was pleasant.  Aside from it being very loud with some items a little on the pricy side, I would definitely return for the pizza.",

Well the bar part is great, the service is wonderful, the bartenders are great.  However the food really needs some help.  We have been there on 3 different occasions, the food was OK one time, and really not so good the 2nd and 3rd time. My boyfriend NEVER sends anything back, sent a pizza back.  They really need to work on adding flavor and being consistent.  We are hoping this is just a case of growing pains and the management and kitchen will figure it out.

I returned later that week, on Friday, to try the rusty onion app & get another philly. I was EXTREMELY disappointed second time around. Chips for app were burnt as were my fries & sub. I asked for no peppers but they still put red peppers - even seemed to notice the mistake before I left but still gave me the wrong sandwich. I'll give them another shot because the first time was so great but I was disappointed the second visit.  The staff are friendly but seem lost at times. I realize it's a new business but I feel like they need more experienced staff that want to help, not staff that keep trying to pass the buck. I sincerely hope they read & implement the reviews they receive because they could be GREAT! Perhaps they need my expertise... ;-)",
