Everything is reasonably priced and the included 8oz side of soup is a nice touch. My only complaint is that I wish they served freshly toasted garlic bread instead of the plain roll that comes with most meals, wink wink.",

Way too creamy with very little flavor. I get broc and cheddar at Harris teeter and it is much better and cheaper. We ended up throwing the soups away. We never throw food away.

The carnivore got she-crab soup which had a very strong crab flavor but not much crab; overall the taste was good. We've decided to go back, try other items on the menu and give it another shot.",

The soup and sandwich combo is my go-to. You can get half a sandwich and a bowl of soup or a full sandwich and a cup of soup. Soups: I've had she crab, crab and corn bisque (special of the day), and loaded potato. Sandwiches: I've had egg salad, ladles grilled cheese (cheese, bacon, and onions...yum!), and Barron Von ladles (ham and Swiss on a pretzel roll with a special mustard). My favorite by far: Barron Von Ladles and she crab soup. Remember you can ask to sample any soup. The staff is very nice and the restaurant is clean. Enjoy!",

I've been a few times and will say that I like their soup better than the sandwiches. Sandwiches are fine but very basic. Great spot for lunch or to grab soup to take home. All the staff I've encountered are ultra friendly and helpful and the restaurant is always very clean. My go to on rainy day, or any day.",

Only water and tea were available because drink machine was down....free pass on that, as it can happen. Our soup was barely warm. I prefer HOT soup, but the young lady working register/orders was not the friendliest so we decided to just suck it up and eat it. So-so flavor, but the temperature of it was unacceptable. My salad was mediocre, at best, and my boyfriends sandwich was toasted for maybe a few seconds. This place claims it's \"gourmet\" salads, soups and sandwiches?!?!  I honestly could have stayed home and made a better sandwich, soup and salad. Our order was 28.00. I realize everyone has an \"off-day\" but for the price and quality, we will not be going back!",

With my intent being to pick up sushi at a nearby establishment, I quickly clicked over to the handy Yelp app for a restaurant search and low and behold Ladles was listed #1...  I ordered a Turkey Bacon Griller with a side of Garden Vegetable soup. The soup was very good! Although, I felt my serving was a bit overtaken by oregano and green beans - no offense to green beans and their families - but a little better coverage of all veggies would make it amazing! I like the fact that the soups and scratch made daily.  The TBG was greasy but very very hearty and delish! They did not shy away from the turkey or bacon .. and for the price I paid I appreciated not being shorted on The Meats! The cookies look very tasty too.  They have a very nice variety of soups and sammies for your liking...  It is a cozy environment, so it can fill up quickly during the lunch hours if you don't plan on taking it to-go.",

I had to ask for it to be warmed up...it was, as the guy at the front was very very pleasant. But it was still a little cold inside...so not warmed enough. Suggestion: serve a freshly toasted/warmed bun with the soup! If this is something that is already done...I missed out, but if not, it would have made the world of difference to my experience and to this review. Otherwise, great location, good service, good options. Hope to be back to a fresh toasted, butter melting bun...warm through and through!",

Seriously, it was filled with hard pasta and get this...one tiny strip of pulled chicken. One. The soup also needed lots of salt.  The ham & cheese sandwich was also soggy and boring. I do better.  But contrary to another guest, I found the two people working there so unfriendly I thought of walking out without the purchase. No customer contact at all. I even asked if the chips & roll that come with the meal were in the bag so not to insult her by opening the bag in the store. Guess what...not there when I got home.  Not ever going back.  Update:  Positive.  After receiving  a message from the owner I found out the person behind the counter was not representative of the establishment and apologized for my experience. I went back recently for a Turkey bacon griller and that in itself was great and I was pleased with the courteous service. No longer any reason not to frequent Ladles.",

And the Turkey Chili is so spot-on, you'd never know it's turkey. My husband had no idea and thoroughly enjoyed it. Don't bother asking for \"regular\" chili. They don't have it. Just ask to taste it and you'll see for yourself. As a matter of fact, ask to taste any & all they have that day! They want you to be happy with the soup you choose! Now that's customer service. Don't miss out on the Pear & Walnut Salad with Champagne Dressing. It's soooo good. I got a half salad and bowl of soup and was pleasantly stuffed!! All comfort food here. Can't decide? They have a Soup Sampler. Three cups of soups of your choice with bread. So happy.",

I had the club, my wife had the grilled cheese/bacon/tomato special which she liked as well.   A plus is that they let you sample their soups before you buy. We tried the buffalo chicken, broc cheddar, potato & also she crab. All were WAY too heavy with the cream soup base.  You could barely taste the actual flavors of the soup. My wife settled on the vegetable soup but it was so so too.   Maybe they had a bad day, I'd give them another try.",

I've been to Ladles at least 10 times with friends and every time it's disappointing. Can't even master an egg salad sandwich. The salads lack flavor. You can go and try it for yourself but I would save my money for somewhere better! Panera bread is better than this place!!",

I live close by and never ventured in because honestly, I'm not a big Soup fan (hate onions). Daaaang I missed out. I'm about to become a regular.  I ordered the pear/walnut/blue cheese salad and it was amazing. I don't mind paying $9.95 for a big GOOD salad.  I know how expensive all the ingredients are. Nice blend of mixed greens (not crappy nutrient-free romaine or iceberg) and generous with the yummy stuff. Pear was ripe. Fresh everything. Dressing was great.   Mom is a senior and a soup connoisseur. She makes and freezes her own homemade \"grandma\" soups and she LOVED the tomato basil. She had that and 1/2 a club sandwich which she said was \"perfect\". This is a massive compliment.  Dad (senior) is spoiled by mom and often claims all soups are \"too salty\". He LOVED the broccoli cheese soup and said his tuna sandwich was \"fantastic\". He's tough to please sometimes so this is gooooood.  While we waited for our carry out (lunch) it was definitely busy but a few open tables. Everything we saw looked delish. Staff was super friendly and fast with carry out so no complaints there. Def coming back soon.",
