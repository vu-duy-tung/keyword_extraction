We started with the hummus and beef shwarma and pita bread. My husband ordered the chicken kabob with the house salad and lentil soup while I opted for a chicken shwarma sandwich. My husband's kabob was moist and full of flavor, the vegetables were perfectly sauteed and the lentil soup was mouth watering. My chicken shwarma sandwich was served hot with pickles and a creamy yogurt sauce tucked into a large home made pita. The portions were so generous that we brought the majority of our meal home with us. If you are looking for a reasonable my priced Mediterranean restaurant I highly recommend Pita Kabob!",

    "text": "Best Lebanese middle eastern food I have had since travelling to Lebanon some 30 years ago.  I am from Chicago and the food here beats anything I could find in the multitude of middle eastern restaurants in the Chicago area.  The Baba Gonousch was excellent, the hummus was so creamy and the pita bread was hot and fresh.  Could have made a meal out of the appetizer portions alone. The lamb shank was cooked to perfection and fell off the bone.  The mixed grill meat kabobs were nicely seasoned, perfectly grilled and very tasty. The meals were served with a large very fresh salad and nicely prepared grilled fresh vegetables.  We enjoyed the meal with a nice glass of Chateau Ksara red wine from the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon-a very nice 2014 vintage.    Loved the food.  The portions are large so we took home enough leftovers for another meal.  When I go back I would share a meal or if it was a group I would order only 2 or 3 dishes and share them family style.  The restaurant is casual, the service was good and Sam the owner could not have been nicer.    I don't live in the area but I will come back just to go to this restaurant.   Loved It!",

Stop in once, and you will become a repeat customer.  The restaurant can seat 200+ people.  They have a lovely patio where they have set up a Hookah lounge. I ate lunch there yesterday with a girlfriend, and I plan to return this evening for dinner with my husband.   The Pita Kebab is a wonderful addition to Matthews!

First of all chicken shawarma is never made with just white meat, it has a combination of white and dark meat to avoid dryness and add flavor. The shawarma had big chunks of white meat, pickle and loads of garlic spread thats it. It was missing many things including flavor, will not be returning because their are other places in charlotte that serve better flavored shawarma.",

It's one thing to review a restaurant for it's delicious food, but something completely different  when you can review a restaurant because of its ownership.  Nasim and Sam create such a warm and welcome environment you feel like you're family.  The food? It's unmatched in this area.  I've visited the middle east, and since then I've tried every restaurant I can find claiming their recipes are authentic.  I'm not a scholar on authentic middle eastern Food, but from New York down to Florida, above all the restaurants I've tried, this one is the best in my opinion hands down.  I used to be a regular at Kabob Je in Matthews.  In the last several months it hasn't been the same, and I realized it was because Nasim had left.  I'm not sure the reasons behind his departure, but I'm glad he opened this one!  It's a hit!  Not only can it fit over 200 people, but it's a hookah bar and alcohol will soon be served at his full bar.  I highly recommend at least trying it out! It's not expressive either!  There's something for everyone!",

We tried the Pita Sampler #2 appetizer , and it along with the entree side of Lebanese Salad (which is the size of a meal salad) could have easily satisfied us. So we had to save a good portion of it to make room for our entrees. The hummus and Baba Gonousch were amazing, and the pita was fresh from the oven, they looked like bread  pillows inflated with hot air!  I had the beef shawarma, which had a heaping mound of moist beef and lamb, with grilled veggies and light and moist yellow rice. Terrific. My wife had the mixed grill, kebabs of chicken, lamb, kafka. Delicious.   Everything is super fresh and made in house only. Sam, the owner came over to meet us and checked in a couple times to make sure we had everything and liked everything. The wait staff was super attentive and friendly and helpful.   The bad news is we could not come close to eating it all, and the good news is that we didn't eat it all, because I'm looking forward to having it again tonight!  Great fresh and healthy food, prepared with pride and served by very nice folks. One of the best overall restaurant values I've experienced, period.",

For us, today, it was very good. The kafta khash khash was very tasty. I normally just go with schwarma at Mediterranean places, but decided to try something new and I'm glad I did. Our server, Rosanna (ask for her when you dine there because she's awesome) recommended I get the rice with my dish... did not disappoint. The result was a mountain of food which I could not finish. I cannot remember if I've ever brought home leftovers from a restaurant from my plate.. my wife and daughter.. always.. me... nope. I have either dinner tonight or lunch tomorrow waiting for me in the fridge.  Now mind you, we LOVE Kabab Je... but my wife swears the hummus at Pita Kabab was better than at Kebab Je. We got enough food for two meals today at lunch.",

It was said to feed four , yet the four of us and the toddler all ate well, with left overs for at least two of us to repeat the meal. I also order extra cucumber yogurt salad and taboo-lie, with baklava for four. Every thing was delicious , fresh and the freshest Pita I have had I a long time. And to my delight the meal was both authentic Mediterranean served still on the Kabab over a huge bed of rice and vegetables, also fresh and prepare and presented with care and respect for the customer.  And although this was a to go order all was fresh hot and well packed for the ride to dinner . It appeared to be a family of  brothers working hard to please. They even ran out after me with my wallet I just left behind. This place is great!!!!",

We went on a Wednesday night for dinner. There were a lot of cars in the parking lot, but we were promptly seated. We ordered the baba ganoush for an appetizer. It was delicious and huge. Entrees were similarly generous in size.   The owner, Sam, recommended the lamb shank with saffron rice to my husband. I had the beef kofta. Entrees come with a salad or soup. The salad dressing was great, and their homemade pita is fantastic.   We took half our meals home because they were so big, and leftovers the next day were amazing.   Very friendly service.

I ordered the mix shawmara and knafeh.  Both I've had before at another establishment across town but wanted it closer by.  There was no wait when I walked in and dinner time was just starting as soon as I walked in.  I waited probably non more than 15 mins for my food.  I suppose the price was fair although the knafeh was pricey but a pretty big size as Mousa the waiter assured me.  The shawarma was flavorful and loved the veggies.  It was very unique to have cranberries mixed in.  The chicken seemed reheated or cooked under a brick/pressed.  It was stiff and broke in chucks with my fork.  If this is normal, then I'll stick to beef.  I'd like to try the grape leaves (from an actual restaurant) and kebab next time.",

Everything is served straight from the kitchen to the table, the food doesn't sit out waiting for a waiter to pick it up. They give their customers healthy portions of fresh veggies, juicy chicken, fluffy rice, amazing sauces & deserts! They are quick, efficient, and above all, welcoming. They treat you like they would a guest in their own home. The owner of the joint is always a friendly face to see. He's always greet and joke around with his customers.  Pita Kabob's just one of those restaurant you're going to have to try out for yourself to know how amaze balls it is. The food alone will make you come back for more, the friendly staff tops it off!",

We used to order the pickles as an appetizer they used to come on a plate then last time in small bowl and today I didn't see on the menus. The rice as a side is getting smaller....it's rice folks the best plate filler around. My friend had the beef kafta and it was so very small. Again I love this place but keep the value here.

For an appetizer we ordered the hummus with pita bread.    The pita bread was soft on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside, I could eat it all day especially with the hummus. I had to prevent myself from getting another order of the pita. The hummus is a chick pea dip that was mixed with the right amount of garlic, tahini (ground sesame seeds), olive oil and lemon juice that was creamy and delicious. Definitely better than the store bought kind.    The Lebanese salad included fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, onions radish served with a house salad. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary and I would not order it if it did not come with the Lamb Kebob as a main course. I did order my house salad on the side as I always find salads overdressed or drenched with the dressing when I order it at restaurants.    Now onto the main course. The lamb kebob with rice was seasoned well and cooked perfectly to a medium rare. There were grilled pieces/chunks of lamb along with peppers and onions where were grilled well and not burned.    The portions here are large and everyone in our party was able to take food home with them, even the ravenous men.",

    "text": "It's hard to believe these 5 star reviews. This place isn't terrible, but it is definitely average. There was so much wrong!  Decor: Downright depressing. Our large party was seated in a far off room with absolutely no decor and silverware wrapped in paper napkins. I felt like we'd traveled back in time and were sitting at the kids' table.   Service: fine during dinner but when we got the check...whoa! I'll get to that later.   Food:  Falafel-dry, dense, and bland. A boxed version prepared at home is much better Stuffed grape leaves-passable but quite *meh* Beef kabob-dry and tough. Took my dog 20 minutes to gnaw on a piece at home-no joke Chicken kabob-flavorful but dry Shrimp kabob-in a lemon garlic  sauce that didn't taste like lemon OR garlic. Also, the shrimp was drenched in it.  Veggies with the kabobs-mushy  Kibbeh(my absolute favorite food)-dry, dry, dry Tabouleh-not enough lemon or tomatoes or salt or oil. Basically chopped parsley with a minuscule amount of bulgur.  Tabouleh is one of the easiest things to get right yet somehow it was all wrong.  Kufte kebab-if you choose to go, order this. The meat was flavorful and juicy. The only star of the night.   Portions are large and come with soup or salad and rice or fries. Prices are fair.   Drinks: We ordered 2 glasses of Merlot. We received them ice cold in small glasses which had 1/4 pour in them. The pour was closer to a wine tasting, than an actual glass of wine.   SCAM ALERT: We had ordered 2 kids meals (which come with a drink).  The check came and we were charged for those sodas. We then noticed that 2 small glasses of wine had been charged ($5.99. ea), voided out and then added as 2 large glasses of wine for $8.99 ea. What???!!! $8.99 for a small glass filled a fourth of the way with cheap, chilled merlot?    They just started serving wine and the waiter didn't know what they had and there was no wine list. Unacceptable.  The owner needs to list the wines and prices for the waiter until they get their sh*t together and provide a wine list. We, of course, brought all this to the attention of our waiter.  He claimed only fruit punch is free with kids meals. He also said that the merlot in particular is the same price for a small or large glass. Just the merlot. Okaaaayyy. He adjusted the bill.   A 20% gratuity was added automatically. Didn't see that mentioned on the menu but to be fair, I wasn't looking for it. So make sure you check before tipping. As a matter of fact, scrutinize every single item on the check. Between the extra 20% we almost added, the $4 for the sodas, the $6 for the supposed large wines, we almost overpayed by $50.",

The servers are super sweet and very respectful to guests. It was my 3 year old's birthday and they sang in English and Arabic!  It's a must try!!",

The fried cauliflower was nothing out of the ordinary. However that baba ghanoush was beyond nasty . Wanted to taste the texture of the eggplant but the overwhelmingly taste of charcoal did not work with this black man's taste buds. I ended up ordering the deluxe falafel sammich which was magical . My wife ordered the fried cauliflower and Greek salad which she said was aiight. Will I be back, probably not since it's so far away from Charlotte and so freakin' expensive. In conclusion, I would only recommend this establishment only if you want to try something different.",

    "text": "I ate dinner here on a moderate Saturday night. I sampled their vegetarian platter, chicken kebab, and chicken shawarma. The only things worth trying are the hummus and the chicken kebab skewer. Everything else was either too salty or too bland. The pita bread came out warm and nice but ended up hard and awkward a couple minutes later. I could tell that their menu was a bit too similar to another Mediterranean restaurant down the street in Matthews. I want to see more originality in this new pita place and not imitation. Finally, the wait staff. I had 2-3 waiters serving on me. They did not work together and communicate well to each other. My check came out wrong, they forgot my takeout order until I reminded them, they tried to take my silverware away before my entree came out, and it took them three tries to get my check right. Hopefully in the future, they will get a better trained staff and more originality present in their restaurant.",

They had the typical Middle Eastern desserts like baklava but they also had a rice pudding that was to die for! I would rate this as the best Middle Eastern restaurant in the Charlotte area. This will definitely become one of my go to restaurants.",

We were sat at a table with a sorts of middle eastern antiques. Secondly, the staff is very welcoming and friendly. They are patient and well read in their menu. Finally, and this it the most important part, THE FOOD IS AMAZING. I sampled the baba ghanouj, hummus, and tabouli, all perfectly spiced and smoked. The pita came to the table fresh out the oven. Because I came with my family, we decided to try the family platter, which a mix of lamb, kafta, and chicken kabob along with rice and vegetables. I am not even being drastic when I say it put Kebab-Je and all other Middle Eastern restaurants to shame. The spices were spot on in the meats and the rice was among the best I've ever had. Definitely coming back and soon.",

Is it really because we all want to so badly believe that Matthews actually has something decent to offer in terms of restaurants?  Are we that desperate that we are willing to kid ourselves?    The owner is very nice and it is my understanding that he was the chef from je kebab?  Or something like that...whatever, details not important.  Bottom line....the food is just not good, the atmosphere leaves MUCH to be desired.  The place has a feel of an old Shoney's.  We had a party of 10 and everyone except for one (the one who would eat mayo on a cupcake if given the opportunity) hated their food.  We all ordered different items but the consistent complaint was that the chicken grossed everyone out.  It was dry, tasteless, and disgusting.  Everything else was either bland, dried out or tasted old.    Overpriced for the quality and just not a pleasant experience.  I hate it because I would love nothing more than another solid restaurant in this area but this isn't it.  ***Update, all of the above now make sense after reading Zack P's review...****",

The Tabouleh was DRY The Chicken Shawarma sandwich was tasteless and sloppy. The Shish Tawook Sandwich was DRY and tasteless The Kibbeh was DRY The Cucumber Yogurt Salad was OK The Tiramisu was awful in taste and texture. They were highly understaffed and it took them 45 minutes to approach us!  I will never return and will immediately go back to Kabab Je for any future Mediterranean food craving.....",

Have read reviews and saw mixed opinions about some \"other\" place so here is an unbiased opinion from a family who had never been to either.   The customer service was good according to my husband he was greeted and even offered a drink on the house while waiting to pick up our food so there's a star.   Got the food home (we live about five minutes away) food was still hot which is a good thing.   My husband got the mixed grill kebabs thing, I got the vegetarian platter. And he ordered a side of hummus. It's True the portions are very large! But we honestly did not enjoy the food that much. We eat hummus literally every day, and this hummus is far from the best Hummus We've ever had. My husband said it kind of tasted like pizza in a weird way ..in my opinion it kind of tasted smoked which maybe that is how they wanted it to taste? But it's just not for us. we don't really have any desire to return especially at those prices, when I can cook at home.",

    "text": "This building in Matthews (by the post office) has been several Mexican restaurants over the past several years, and now it's a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean one.  While you can definitely see what was obviously a Mexican-themed exterior and interior, it works fine for this new reincarnation.  The space is much bigger and nicer inside than I originally thought, so that was a nice surprise.  To start, they bring you complimentary pita bread.  Lots of it.  There isn't really anything to put on it (unless you purchase hummus or something separately), but it has a good flavor on its own.  Or better yet, save it for use with your entree.  The menu has a variety of items from which to choose.  Since they didn't have a description (or photo), I asked our server to describe a few of them.  She didn't really know and grabbed the owner/manager who was super friendly, but looked at me like I asked him for his first born.  I just wanted to make an educated decision about my entree, that's all.  Some descriptive text and/or photos would help the newbies.  Anyway, I went with the chicken shawarma.  With the main entrees come two sides.  I opted for the side salad and rice.  The \"side\" salad was gigantic.  The dressing was fantastic.  My partner fell in love with his side (i.e., big bowl) of lentil soup and wouldn't shut up about how great it was.  So I tried it.  It was excellent, and I'm not even a huge fan of lentil soup.  Then came the entrees.  OMG.  Each plate could have fed a small village.  I ate what I could but still ended up taking home a lot of it.  The leftover chicken made two salads and the leftover rice and veggies made their own meal.  You certainly got a lot for your money.    We'll definitely return.  The food and service were both excellent, and the prices were very reasonable.",

    "text": "After seeing a number of people recommending this place (downtown Matthews) a friend and I went. My friend's father is Palestinian so whenever we go out for lunch it's always for Mediterranean. La Shish & Kabab Je being the most frequent stops.   The chef (Nasim) at Pita Kabab is the former chef from Kabab Je. So, when the food came out and it looked incredibly familiar in prep, it made sense once the chef came and introduced himself.   I love La Shish but I must say I'll probably move my support over to Pita Kabab. The food is amazing, the guy is just starting out and if we could have that location in downtown Matthews successfully make it (instead of being a revolving door of restaurants) I for one couldn't be happier. I'm sold.   In short; completely worth it and the prices are so cheap I wonder how he's even keeping the door open. Love this place!!",

I sat there for 15 mins with no refill on my drink and I asked for my check and had already handed the server my card and waited another 15 mins for him to bring it back to me. I called the manager over and said I had to return back to work but the manager was too busy texting on his phone. Not sure how this place got such rave reviews.    I have been in the service industry myself for many years. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. Don't worry though after I paid the bill it was no time for Alen to snatch the bill back up. I didn't want to tip him anything but left him a dollar.     Alen didn't even tell me thank you or anything when he brought the bill back. Worst service EVER. Stay away.",

When I saw the chance to eat at a Mediterranean, family-owned establishment, I raced here.   Admittedly, I over ordered because I was so excited to get a \"flavor\" for what they had to offer. I got the \"pita sampler 1\" as an appetizer and the \"pita kabob mix grill\" as the main course. Much of both leaving with me in to-go boxes! The appetizer quality and portion were enough for a meal for two in itself! The humus, definitely nothing like store-bought flavors that Americans are accustomed to. The kabobs - oh man! Incredible.  Definitely worth every dollar spent!!  If you're in the mood for something different, maybe a little adventurous, do come here",

    "text": "This is my first time having Mediterranean food and after hearing other people Rave about this place I made sure that it was on my calendar in May.  The atmosphere is enhanced by some different colored light features that add to the ambiance and the dining room is broken into sections so each little area feels cozy and complete.   Our server was amazing at explaining what the different items on the menu were and even brought us two samples of the chicken shwarma (sp?) vs. the meat one to help us decide what to order for dinner. The samples were really generous and the tahini sauce for the meat plus the garlic sauce for the chicken was incredible.   We ended up choosing to appetizers and splitting an entree. The hummus on the appetizer menu is to die for and the pita bread they serve with it is absolutely heavenly. Then there is the fried cauliflower that has yet another amazing sauce that we devoured instantly.  For the entree we ended up choosing the meat Kabob sampler platter which came with two sides. Since we were sharing we decided to do two side salads which were large and fresh with a light citrus dressing. (It's almost crazy that the salads were my least favorite thing but I think it's just because everything else was so darned good.)  The sampler platter featured some lamb and some chicken and some kafta kebabs. Kafta is ground beef and lamb mixed together to make meatballs and it was my least favorite of the three choices. They brought out the same delicious garlic sauce (that's based on egg whites) for us to dip the chicken in and (bc it was her fav sauce) our waitress Star also brought out a bowl of a red tomato based sauce that paired exquisitely with the lamb kabob.  At the close of our meal we were convinced we could not eat another bite and the owner Sam stop by our cable and insisted we try his favorite dessert which was his baklava. He presented us with a piece of Walnut and pistachio baklava which we enjoyed very much and marveled at how such a weighty item could melt in our mouths so fast and feel so light!  I cannot wait to bring my parents here and my kids as well as I am convinced that they will be fast fans of Sam's Lebanese-styled Mediterranean recipes as soon as they try one bite.",

Major kudos to them for the perfectly packed to-go order!!!! Wanting to sample several items, I ordered Fattoush salad w/beef shawarma, Cabbage salad, and Foul Mudammas. Since some restaurants typically add more dressing than I care for, I've learned to request it on the side. All of this came with pita bread, and again - was perfectly packed.  Fattoush w/beef shawarma was tasty, but only while the beef was still warm. Lesson learned: either share that salad, or order with chicken. A leftover salad with cold beef isn't exactly good.   Their cabbage salad with tomatoes isn't what I expected. The purple and green cabbage wasn't shredded thin (like a certain Greek restaurant does) but rather thicker shreds. Also,a few pieces of the core had slipped in there. The dressing for it was good, though.  My favorite was the Foul Mudammas, which was excellent.  Oh, I'm going back - but this time it will be for their Greek salad with chicken.",

I liked that it was cozy and a quiet space.  Definitely do not judge the place by its exterior.   There is charm on the inside that you just don't see on the outside.

It was very odd.  I got the falafel sandwich and was not impressed, but the fries & hummus were good.",

I have never had this standard of Mediterranean  food. This food is just outstanding. My only recommendation for this restaurant is to create a more authentic atmosphere. Otherwise AMAZING.",

It came with superb grilled vegetables, a large fresh salad, and a giant bowl of soup. Everything was delicious.   The restaurant has plenty of seating and is comfortable. I prefer this place over the other Middle Eastern place in town because it has fountain drinks, large portion lunch specials for $7-8, and great service. I'll definitely be back soon.",

Our table was in a side, unclean, empty room. We couldn't see the performance.  We had no food on our table for two hours.   During this time the restaurant owner was entertaining, dancing, singing.  In two and a half hours, we advised the stuff we are leaving,  and were offered free appetizers and food immediately.   We stayed.  When our checks came, there was no any discount + 20% gratuity already included.  We reminded about the offer, but the stuff gave us many lies not to honor the promise.  Manager stated: \"I don't care if any of you ever come back.\"  Ruined celebration,  stress instead of relaxing on Saturday. Any respectful restaurant would have given 50% up to 100 % off the bill for this kind of experience. Advice: if you have a big group,  don't go to Pita Kebab Grill or better, save your health,  don't go at all.",

The chicken shawarma platter was huge and delicious especially for the price. My boyfriend enjoyed his Greek salad with chicken but wished he got what I did.

I like how they redid the space, there are lots of separate dining areas, a bar area & a patio (didn't get to check that out though). They said they will start serving beer and wine within a week, bonus!  Everyone working in the restaurant was really friendly and helpful - we were asked so many times if everything was okay or if we needed anything. Actually some of the staff and the chef came here from Kabab Je, so it's worth checking them out if you're a fan of Kabab Je.   The food was as delicious as I'd hoped - we split our \"regular\"- the mixed grill (3 kabobs - chicken, lamb, kafta), the falafel appetizer and hummus. The entrees come with two sides, so we got saffron rice and salad. We had so much food, we had leftovers for the next night! Everything was amazing and I can see myself going here every week.",

We returned yesterday for take two and it did not disappoint. The amount of food you get for the price is outstanding. The food is freshly made and is mouth watering.   I ordered the hummus and chicken shawarma appetizer and it ended up being my meal. The hummus was prepared perfectly! So good I don't think I could prepare it in my kitchen after trying 1000 times. Which sounds crazy because its a basic dish but wow theirs is great. The chicken was seasoned well and very juicy. My son tried to eat my plate instead of his chicken and fries.   My wife had the platter #2 which was amazing as well. It's a huge plate of hummus, falafel, and Baba ghanouj(spell check). This plate was very fresh as well and is very healthy.   Upon check out our server was so nice and my 2 year old son loved her. She asked him if he wanted to come with her. Being a huge flirt he said \"yesssss\". She took him to the front counter and let him hit the buttons on the computer to check us out. He loved every bit of it.   This place is a must go! Please support their business.",

    "text": "Your chance to try a variety of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean foods.  This is the real deal and fortunately you have guides available to help you choose among the many offerings.  What makes it hard is that the food is from a not-so-familiar culture to Americans.    We liked the menu as it breaks down into categories, like kabobs, shawarma, plates, pitas, etc.  Your waiter will pick up the slack and the two waiters we experienced were as friendly and helpful as you could wish for. Malek was our primary who did a great job for us.  The have a decent selection of beer and wine.  We sipped as we studied the menu.  Then we ordered a Lebanese salad which was delicious and had a very nice dressing.  Don't know what it was, but it was tasty.  We also ordered a lentil soup, expecting a little cup, but it turned out to be a bowl...a meal in itself.  And, of course, we had a basket of very fresh, warm pita bread which was soft and yeasty straight from the oven.  Wife had the Kafta Kabab which was the best choice.  Meaty and flavorful, with yellow rice.  Glad she shared.  I had the shawarma beef which was OK.  It was a huge portion of sliced beef that was somewhat dry, and it was accompanied by mixed roasted veggies.  The veggies were pretty much flavorless and coupled with the basic dry beef I did not like the meal.  My fault, not theirs.  The restaurant reminds me of a 1930s steak house with lots of large rooms and a big bar.  Very spacious, so would accommodate groups, special events and large families.  And they have some big sized special roast and baked Mediterranean specials which would be expected in the Middle East at banquets.  They can handle those here.  A fun, interesting eating experience.  Worth a try and bring a couple of couples so you can share more items among yourselves.",

Owner came by while I was sitting at the bar waiting for my food and asked me how I was doing and gave me a nice pat on the back like I was indeed family.

I ordered the sample platter 2 from the appetizers list which, for only ten bucks, came with hummus, babaganoush, 3 grape leaves, 3 falafel and tabbouleh salad.  And of course unlimited pita!   First off - the hummus was amaze!  So creamy and smooth, probably the best hummus in Charlotte.  The falafel was also very very good.  For someone who usually goes for the meat option, I would definitely order a falafel pita here next time I come.  Everything else was good too!  My friend ordered the chicken swarma hummus which was also very tasty!",

Do not go by the outside , inside is like a little treasure. Its not small inside, the decor is very simple not over done.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu.  We wanted to try everything lol We started with the hummus an fresh made pita bread . The hummus is light an so creamy, the pita bread Was great. We ordered the fried cauliflower really baked with tahini sauce. Most places do buffalo cauliflower to spicy I cant eat it. I was very excited this was tahini an I was not disappointed the flavor was amazing. I ordered the chicken skewers which came with a salad an veggies. The chicken was my favorite moist an great flavor. The salad was really good the dressing was almost like an oil n vinegar base with spices. My chicken skewers had an amazing sauce that I made them tell me what it was lol Its called Toum a creamy garlic sauce for dipping . I also ordered homemade chicken soup I will this for winter time on those cold days. Lots of food an lots of take home boxes lol Now we tried their Baklava well I am ruined now no more Greek feast baklava lol This was not the honey dripping with the clove in the middle. I am pretty sure I could eat several of these lol If your in charlotte this place located right in Matthews. Make a stop you wont regret it:)",

I started out with the hummus and delicious hot pita bread, paired with a Brooklyn lager on draft. So pleased to see that they had so many beer options. I decided to go with the lamb and rice special and was glad that I did. Lamb was fall off the bone tender and the rice and onions were the perfect compliment. I really have no complaints. Owner came out to check on my meal and the waitress was friendly and attentive. If you are a fan of Mediterranean food, you've got to give Pita Kabab a try.",

Since it was 2.30 pm or so it was pretty empty. We got the makanek sausage which was just ok, different from others I've had since they used a yogurt based sauce. The kibbe was delicious but needed some salt. We ordered the spicy potatoes but they were not in the least bit spicy so asked for a hot sauce on the sauce that improved the taste. I had the beef kebab sandwich which was ok but the beef was kinda tough. Their baklava was absolutely delicious though! Man, I could have another piece right now! We got some food to go for dinner but they messed up our sides, we didn't get the lentil soup which I had been looking forward to! We got the hummus with chicken but the chicken seemed more like shredded rotisserie chicken instead of shawarma. The mixed grill was just ok, the best piece in it was the kafta which was tender and well seasoned. Chicken and beef kebabs were on the dry side. We also got the kafta kish kash which I liked because it was the kafta and it change with a delicious red sauce!  If I come here again it will be for the kafta, kibbe, baklava and I'd love to try their lamb shanks!",

The woman finally came and greeted us with a very rude attitude like she was annoyed of our presence. She asked what we wanted and when I said we don't know we need a menu, she rolled her eyes. She put in our order and told us to wait. One table in the entire restaurant and 40 minutes later we receive our salads. No apology for the long wait just rings us up. My friend did not tip because the customer service was below par and when the lady noticed she CRUMBLED up the receipt in front of her face. My point is this lady should NOT be involved with any sort of customer service & I definitely won't be back to wait 40 minutes for a salad.",

Let me start with belly dancing...I was born in the middle east but this was horrible. Girls couldn't dance they looked absolutely herrendous, they sat us in a different room and one of the girls stopped twice for a few seconds (we actually were thankfull for that because we couldn't watch that performance it was that bad) but if people came to watch a show make sure you show it to them stop by more often and perform. We waited for 2.5 hours without getting any of the food and right before we were ready to leave manager came over apologized and promised food right away and appetizers on the house. (While we waited we spilled wine on the table and waitress would not even change the single use tablecloth,  no one stopped by to ask us if we want more water or wine, absolutly horrible service)Few minutes later we get all appetizers and entries at the same time. Who does that???? Food was so so I have had better from a truck stand. The best part comes when we got the check. All appetizers were on the bill plus 20% gratuity!!!!! You have got to be kidding us!!! Called the manager and she said she didn't remember saying that. Wtf???? Then the owner comes promises us to remove it, we get the checks again and some of us still have appetizers on, when some people went to talk to him he was absolutly rude to customers whos night was ruined and he yelled at them by saying \"dont any of you return we dont want you here\". AVOID THIS PLACE.....PEOPLE RUNNING IT ABSOLUTLY RUDE, HORRIBLE SERVICE, BAD FOOD AND PITTIFUL DANCERS.",

In fact I rarely do it but this is one case where it is warranted First of all the restaurant has zero atmosphere  A K and W cafeteria offers more  So if you are looking for some this is not the place  But atmosphere is not everything if the food is decent  It's not  Over cooked , bland and to be honest it is just awful   Lamb and chicken were so over cooked it was barely palatable . This was both the skewers and the so called rack of lamb which was covered with an indistinguishable sauce  Rice was dry and had no substance to it.  Even the Greek salad was poor and you would think they would get that right  Wine must have been stored next to the oven because mine was warm and I don't mean room temp It was overly warm and at $11 a glass they should at least make an effort to store it properly  I read the reviews and now I question who write them as this meal was nowhere near the overall rating  It was as though it was amateur night in the kitchen   Suggest you seek other alternatives if you are looking for Mediterranean food.",

    "text": "Gave this place a try on a Saturday at 6:00.  There were 4 of us and a toddler and we were able to be seated right away.  3 of us had the beef kabobs and one had the chicken. Entrees come with a salad which was pretty good but maybe a little to much parsley. The bread they bring you is excellent and paired with the hummus was fantastic. Hummus was out of this world.   The beef kabobs were sooooo good. You have a choice of sides, I picked the rice, also comes with some grilled vegetables. It's a decent amount of food and definitely worth the price. I didn't try the chicken but I was told it was good, she had enough to bring some home.   If you like the other Mediterranean place not far away from this one you should without a doubt give Pita Kabob a try. Apparently the old chef from that place split and opened Pita Kabob which would explain why the food is so very similar.   The only issue we had was that the baby needed changing and the restrooms don't have a changing table. Changing a baby in a car that's been sitting in the NC June sun isn't ideal.    Other than that this place has a new regular customer- it's excellent!  5/22/18 We used to absolutely love this place but unfortunately every time we go back everything but the price seems to get smaller and smaller. It's no longer a good value for the money. It's to bad because we really loved it here and I originally had it at 5 stars. We would frequent this place 2-3 times a month. Now we go there maybe once every few months.",

Got the meat shawarma and the grilled chicken sandwiches. The meat shawarma was tasty, the right amount of topping just missing the pickled turnips to 100% authentic. The chicken kabab sandwich was so good, lots of flavor but the garlic sauce was a bit much in the sandwich. Ask to get the garlic sauce on the side and control how much garlic you like to have :) over a good experience I wouldn't mind repeating.",

    "text": "This was very good.  We are long time customers and big fans of another similar restaurant in Matthews, but thought we'd try this restaurant for variety.  The server was gracious, friendly and patient.  Very polite and accommodating. I didn't mind the decor.  It's not fancy, but adequate.  The food was plentiful.  We ordered all our favorites and the comparison began.  Our habit is to order all appetizers and share with each other.  Falafel are better at Pita Kabab and you get five.  Kibbeh my husband also preferred here.  The spicy potatoes were less crisp and not as piping hot, however it is a larger serving and might be spicier -- so a draw there. I certainly pigged out on them.   We had Tabbouleh and the Pita Kabab salad which I combine...just a personal taste I make and add the garnish of pickles, radishes and mint and it was basically the same.  The negatives for me, the beef/lamb shawarma and hummus was not as tasty as I am used to.  The meat sliced a bit thicker and a lack of seasoning of the hummus. It was bland.  Also a big negative was the pita.  It was warm and plentiful, but it's just not fresh made and baked on site.  It didn't matter how plentiful it was when we didn't want to gobble it up.  Those are the favorite aspects of our meal when we eat Mediterranean so that's significant to us.  Plus side is there's beer and wine if you like that, it's irrelevant to me.  More indoor seating here.  Ambiance and outside seating at the other place.  There's allot of pluses to this restaurant.  It's a solid choice!  We'll be back to see if it evolves in a good way, bad way or not at all.",

When we asked for recommendations..she provided the perfect options. The lentil soup was savory,  the kebabs were juicy and perfectly marinated, chicken Sharwma was so yummy and the appetizer plate - Baba Ganoush, hummus and Tabouleh was outstanding.  I do not give five stars often,  but eating here brought me back to the days when I lived in San Francisco and the food was always a flavorful, worldly experience.",

    "text": "I loved this place. To start the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and food. He was patient with our questions and we knew little about some of the foods. We had some expirience with greek food. Lebonnese food is a little diffrent. You could tell the waiter had tried different foods on the menu and made recommendations. We started with the fried cauliflower. It was so yummy!! Tender and flavorful! The salad was huge and had a wonderful light vinegar and oil dressing, radishes, cukes. I had to take salad home. Then the entree came. Yummy grilled veggies, rice that was like butter and chicken so tender and juicy....heaven!! I liked the yogurt sauce also. I will be back! My friend who was in the restaurant business is always said she tried to place 3 times before deciding if she really likes it or not because things didn't change so to those who may not like this place at first maybe try it again because seems like the majority of us love it. To each is own.",

We were not disappointed.  Girl friend has the chicken kabob with mixed veggies, said It was the best she ever had.  I had the lamb shank with mixed vegetables; the wow factor was off the charts.  Best lamb I've had in years.  The pita bread is served hot and fresh with a garlic butter that just tops it off, and a killer chicken soup.  And don't pass up the rice dish, it is amazing.  This is just one of the best restaurants in Matthews.  Don't miss it!!!",

The service is great and prompt, we were a group of 4 and were given seats right away. The pita break and baba ganoush were great. The bread was served hot and the combo tasted good. We had ordered chicken wings and they were exceptionally good. This alone was bring you back here. The entree portions are big so be mindful of the number of dishes you order. The chicken was subtle in terms of spices, for my taste, but well done. I have to say the rice served along was very nice and well flavored. They do have some beer varieties, if you want to try. The knafa is a dessert which I was trying for the first time and it's worth the try. Be sure to actually take the portion of cheese into the pita (kind of) bread and then dip it into the rose water syrup before having it. The order has to be followed for an amazing taste experience. The dessert isn't a sugar rush kind of feel but a pleasant feel of sweet flavors for the taste buds. Do give them a try.",

I also love the lentil soup that comes with the platters. All of the platters are great. Sometimes my husband and I share the combo platter. The portions are huge.

Highly disappointing experience. Has completely turned me off the place. Will never return.   Owner/manager needs to do a better job in training his wait staff and attend to customers better.

We were so disappointed and felt sick. Two mixed kabob entrees with french fries, yellow rice and some mooshy vegetables were all over cooked, bland, and stale tasting (really, we couldn't taste spices or flavor). I think the oil they used must have been rancid or really poor quality. My toddler was having disgusting smelling gas the evening and day after he ate some of the meat and french fries, and I had an upset stomach. Even my seven year old who normally goes crazy for French fries (a rare treat for our family) didn't bother much with them. We paid over $40 for two entrees and two small pieces of Baklava (which weren't good, either). I am frustrated we wasted our money. I'm not sure why there are good reviews here. I normally love to compliment people and places, but the food was just so awful that I felt obligated to warn others.",

Vegan, vegetarian, omnivore (the lamb and beef are wonderfully seasoned!) I encourage you to try them out. Clean, huge portions, always fresh and I enjoy talking to the staff. They explain the meaning of each dish and ingredients. It really is a pleasure dining here and they have enough space to accommodate large parties. Oh, you won't be disappointed by their wonderful wine list, love the Chilean Merlot. You can stop in for a quiet lunch, or dinner, you are always treated wonderfully. The owner stops by each table to make sure your meal was satisfactory. I love trying all manner of what I call tapas, so fresh, the pita is amazing but most of all I truly enjoy the delicate seasonings in each dish. I'm Italian, Sicilian, so appreciate the Mediterranean touch.....but truly, if you enjoy food, you need to try the Babaghanouj, Lentils, cauliflower, and (I'm going to maul the name, so sorry!) Makanek (this AMAZING little sausage with grilled tomato chunks).....I love this little place and hope they are here for the long haul. Thank you for another beautiful meal. Enjoy!",

Baklava and Turkish coffee to end the meal.  We will be back again!  There was a band and belly dancer performing too.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

When I brought my hubby for his first time eating real authentic Mediterranean food he was apprehensive at first, but he was blown away by the deliciousness of the food here. Some quotes about the appetizer:  (for reference we had the pita platter #2 ((grape leaves, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, etc))  \"oh my gosh.\" \"this is great.\" \"How is anything this good?\" \"I feel so healthy eating this.\"  We both save most of the appetizer and decided on lamb shanks as Sam had suggested with yellow rice. I had the salad, he [my husband] had the lentil soup. Both delectable and super filling so we saved those too.  The lamb was fall-off-the-bone amazing. The veggies, cooked to perfection. It really was an excellent meal.  Last but not least when our gorgeous server suggested dessert (my husband protested) but I asked if they had baklava to go, of course which they did. He has never had it. When she brought it to the table i took a small bite and asked him to try it. His eyes LIT UP. Absolutely some of the best i've had (and it's rich, so not a lot is needed) but it was soooo good.   The best part other than the huge amount of food, and it being so delicious, and sooooo inexpensive (this can feed us both for a few days) was how you feel like your family and truly appreciated and invited to share in such a wonderful culture with some wonderful people. You guys keep doing what you're doing!  -The Essmans",

The service is friendly and fast and the portions are huge, especially for the price, it's a True steal. The pita is fresh baked and to die for, the baba ganoish and hummus are so well blended and spices, the grape leaves and falafel were hands down the best I have ever had, moist and full of flavor. I tried both lamb shank and lam kabobs and I've never had lamb cooked better besides by my family. I'll be a new regular. Oh, and try the lentil soup as your side starter, it is a meal in and of itself.",

They were skeptical at first, not knowing what most things were. But they left full and happy. They fully enjoyed the food.  Nothing we had disappointed, other than the mozzarella sticks (but honestly, who eats those at a place like this?! My picky daughter and skeptical missionaries. Lol) The fried cauliflower was awesome! We all had some type of kabob and none of us have a complaint. Tons of food and the seasoning perfect. The salad was good, maybe a little excessive on the amount and dressing, but it was still very good. My husband and I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants and Pita Kabob is definitely a new favorite. No doubt we will be back.",

It isn't like that grainy grocery store hummus - yuck! The potatoes were fresh and just the right amount of spice and the salad was beautiful to look at and full of flavor.

We weren't very sure about the menu, we've never had authentic Lebanese cuisine. Out of this world! I had the Greek salad with shawarma ( cooked beef pieces). I was not expecting what I got at all! It was a huge salad with a large portion of meat on top. They also brought out tahini sauce for use to try, and must admit I actually liked it better than tahziki sauce even though I love cucumbers! Our friend that suggested the place ordered a hummus for us all to share and they brought out all the pita we could eat. Now this is not the same pita you get at say showmars, this was puffy and very soft and waaaaaaarrrrrmmm! Excellent! I'm a hummus lover now!! The owner came to speak with us twice and was very sincere, explaining his recipes with us and how healthy Lebanese food really is. BONUS!! Some of the ladies got the kabobs and everyone was pleased. My only advice I'd like to leave with you is, if you order the shrimp kabob, be prepared it's very spicy. I would enjoy that but it's not for everyone. The ambiance is authentic and like I said, we were treated very well! This is a five for me!",
