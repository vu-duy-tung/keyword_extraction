The food is definitely not spectacular and hygiene in kitchen is probably non existent but you have to forget about that if you want to enjoy some dim sum on a random evening. Food was good but even better with the killer hot chilli oil they have on the table. Dont come here for the service- our waitress gave a rude \"hhmph!\" when we asked for a to go box. But when youre craving Chinese and you wanna feel sleepy beepy from MSG come here! (Feels so wrong but so good)",

Got it home and it was way undercooked / raw.  Instead of nice crispy and brown on the outside it was soggy and pink.  No way anyone with the least amount of care should have let it go out of the kitchen.  We are sadly done with Dim Sum and will not be going back.  If you want decent Chinese try Soho Bistro in uptown.",

My fiance and I went out on a limb and tried some shark fin dumplings and squid. While I'm quite familiar with shark anyway, being Caribbean, the squid kind of surprised me. For some reason I wasn't expecting it to be served cold, but it was still good. The texture kind of threw me off a little bit, as it has a slight \"crunch,\" but I still enjoyed it! I can't wait to come back to take part in the actual dim sum menu to see how good the options are!",

We had been there quite a few times when it was owned by the previous owner and were hesitant to try it based on the reviews since it changed hands. We are so glad we went to see and taste for ourselves.  The dim sum carts were rolling and had plenty of delicious offerings, many of which were even better than under the previous owner. We had the Turnip Cake with Chinese Sausage, Taro Stick on Shrimp Biscuit, Fried Sesame Balls, Steamed Roast Pork Bun, Roast Duck, Fried Crispy Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Eggplant, Steamed Chinese Spinach, and Shrimp Rice Noodle Crepe. Everything was outstanding! The Shrimp Rice Noodle Crepe had more flavor than any we've tried before. The service was great and we walked away stuffed! We were one of the few occidentals in the restaurant and that in itself says a lot about the authenticity and high quality of the food.  We arrived at 11:30 and there were very few tables open. We can't wait to go back!",

So I cannot accurately describe the service, other than to say that they were very attentive to us :) But I hear that it gets super busy on the weekends and that it's a completely different vibe in there.   But ultimately you want to know about the food right?   The food was pretty good. To be honest, we really enjoyed the various dishes that we tried. The dumplings seem to come to mind as I write this. Pork and shrimp dumplings were excellent.  The prices are very reasonable. If you give it a shot, I think you'll like it!",

If we're comparing to dim sum restaurants in other cities, it would only get 3 stars. The reason is because the food does not come on carts with heating elements. Truly authentic dim sum restaurants actually cook/steam the foods directly on the carts. So it mostly translates to the temperature of the food and crispiness of the fried items. But if you're in Charlotte and want some dim sum, this is as good as it gets and it's still a very good experience, just don't expect it to be as good as you might find elsewhere in the country.",

Place - decent, reminds me of your typical Chinese restaurant that just needs a bit more of a reno (that is just me being picky).  The restaurant was easy to find, with their red and yellow sign. Parking may be tough if it is busy, since there are limited spots in the front.  A friend suggested to come early Sat at 11am, to get a table before it quickly fills up.  Food - not great, but good. I guess it is as good as it will get in Charlotte. I do miss Houston, TX and NYC's dim sum food.     . I found the 'ha gao' (shrimp dumpling in clear flour) to be mushy =\\    . Their steamed rice with pork, sausage, and mushroom wrapped in banana leaf - was delicious and fulfilling    . Egg custard is good, happy with the taste.    . Chrysanthemum tea is good to help with digestion when you are full.    . My husband who avoids eating chicken feet, was pushed to try it from a friend of ours - he actually liked it. Said the flavor was better than others that he have tried before.  Service - good enough.",

    "text": "It was a Sunday evening in Plaza Midwood and I found myself hungry with a taste for Asian cuisine. I turned to Yelp to find the highest rated spot and Dim Sum seemed to be the best option. I called my order in and figured the food would be great based off the very thick accent on the other side of the phone. My meal consisted of basic Chinese-American fare which I figured would be a safe bet for takeout. I got back to the friend's apartment I was visiting to find that there were no utensils in the bag with our food (none were on display at the Dim Sum restaurant counter either.) The friend I was visiting had just moved in that day and had no accessible utensils, causing me to leave AGAIN to run to the nearest store and pickup forks. When I finally got to eat my dinner, I was severely disappointed. The sesame chicken was okay- the flavor was adequate but the meat tasted cheap and the sauce appeared to be cut with water. The thin, diluted sauce pooled at the bottom of the bowl making the undersides of the chicken soggy. I tried to ignore the fact that the sauce had been contaminated since, after all, it appeared to just be water.  Then I tried the fried rice. My biggest regret in life is that I swallowed the bite off my fork rather than spit it back out. Knowing that the rice was being processed by my body severely grossed me out for the rest of the night. I couldn't decide what would be worse- digesting the rice or the taste of throwing it back up.  Enough about how the rice made me feel and more about the reasoning why: It tasted like it had been soaked in a marinade of water and half decayed cigarette butts. There were no vegetables mixed with the rice and the texture itself seemed as if it had been through a continuous cycle of sitting out, getting microwaved and then set back out again. over and over.   When I went to throw out the entire container after my first bite, my friend protested and offered that he would eat whatever I did not wish to finish. Some background on this particular friend of mine: He will literally eat anything. My friend took a forkful of the rice and had the same immediate repulsion that I myself had endured. His exclamations reasserted my claim of the cigarette taste that clung to the underside of the throat in a heavy aftertaste that entices one to get sick out of some evolutionary reflex.  Maybe the actual Dim Sum cuisine is fine if dining in. Maybe the kitchen doubles as a smoking lounge. Whatever it may be, I regret the overpriced $20 I spent to not be able to actually eat my dinner.",

There were enough options circling for the pescetarian in our group to put together a meal, and I took home a roast duck plate for later, yum! Prices seemed a little high but that's ok, I do wish they had a menu of what they could bring out from the kitchen since my Cantonese is... rusty, to say the least, and I assume out of politeness my interactions with the staff were mostly in english so nobody at the table would feel left out.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for well over a decade and although I should be fluent in Cantonese, I'm not. However, I know the essentials... the names of all my favorite dim sum dishes. Luckily, you don't need to speak mandarin or Cantonese to order here and if you're not sure of what something is the servers are very helpful.  If you're looking for the traditional dim sum experience, you'll need to come here on the weekend because they only have the carts out then. You can still order dim sum any other day but it's a la carte and in my opinion, not their A game. They also have a bunch of menu options if you're looking for some specialty items or American Chinese dishes but can't comment on these because they do a bang up job on their dim sum and that's all I ever get.  Now onto the food, it's no simple task to be able to prepare so many different dishes, especially on a busy Saturday or Sunday morning so I have a huge amount of respect for the cooks. You really can't go wrong here and my favorites are their BBQ pork buns(both steamed and baked are delicious), har gow (shrimp dumplings), rice rolls with little dried shrimp, chicken feet (don't hate), eggplant with shrimp paste, and pretty much anything with their fried shrimp paste in it. Everything has great flavor, texture, overall deliciousness. As others have mentioned, they're tapas sized so you'll have the opportunity to try plenty of food; they're a couple bucks per plate. All that with some jasmine tea and I'm a happy camper.",

The potstickers were too doughy but the filling was good.  The duck had crispy skin and was ok. Nothing earth shattering. The Char Shu bao was ok but seemed like they may have been frozen. But the flavor was good. We had to try the chicken feet ... Um... Not sure why anyone would want to eat these and trying them did not change my mind.   The service was good. I would go back to try some of the other Chinese dishes just to give it a try.",

DO NOT let them put baby in the corner - you'll get passed by every cart.  They have also refused to offer the fried noodles for the soups which is weird and also no more honeydew sliced pork.  Only the basic dumplings are available and not very impressive.  Not sure if I'll be back.  Wish they would fix some of this.  Why is Charlotte so limited in good ethnic foods?!!!

However, having given this place its fair number of chances, I've now given up and have resorted to buying frozen dim sums and mastered my own won ton dumplings at home to beat those cravings.  In short, the dim sum is by far the worst I've had in my liffe, and they don't even come out warm.  Service is horrible even to Chinese customers.  The owner with the short hair has an attitude problem.  However, being the only dim sum place in town (Dragon Court doesn't even count with such a miserable location and setup), I suppose they can get away with anything, food quality or sanitation-wise.    Whenever we get a chance to visit NYC or HK we order dim sum like there's no tomorrow.  I am ashamed to tell our friends why.",

On my first (and probably last) visit, I ordered just about everything on their Dim Sum menu. Traditionally, you're flagging down an attendant pushing around a cart and requesting them to lift up each lid so that you can peek at the deliciousness that is hidden underneath. If you want the item, they'll stamp your card (which is essentially your check) and scamper off to appease another table. They don't do that at this restaurant. Here, you order off a laminated menu with descriptions of the items, which certainly detracts from the Dim Sum experience.  All the items that I ordered were room temperature to cold. I've honestly had better shumai and har gow from the frozen food section of an Asian Supermarket. Some items were just inedible.  I hate wasting food and generally ask for to-go containers for my leftovers, but I can't imagine their food would taste any better hours later so I didn't.  I don't know if their other menu items are any good as I only went there for the Dim Sum, but Dim Sum is definitely not their strong point. I can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant to Dim Sum lovers or people with working taste buds. If you're craving simple Dim Sum items, go to the nearest G Mart or H Mart and buy some because Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant will do nothing to satisfy your craving for it.  I miss you, Chau Chow City. I await with bated breath, until our annual summer rendezvous, where I can once again ravish your hot, steamy buns.  I need a tissue.",

Pricing is pretty typical $3.50 for small plate to $6.50 for a larger plate. You can also request a menu and order from that.   For tripe lovers out there this place no longer use real tripe for their tripe dish. Now they're using a different intestinal lining which is easier to cook, but doesn't taste as good as the normal tripe that we typically know and love.",

So, my family was very happy to hear, out of the blue,  it reopened about 4 or 5 months later.   There were some upgrades to the atmosphere and but basically still the same layout and feel. Everyone looked to be new to us and only a couple of the waiters were carried from the restaurant before the closure. However, the new manager claim that nothing had changed, he stressed it the same restaurant and menu. Hmm...   No comment on the service since, it was none existence that night. Clearly, the management and wait staff were still trying to figure this out. No one said running a restaurant is easy or straightforward. The challenges and difficulties can be very overwhelming especially for noobies...   So the dim sum was mostly the same but changed a bit. The overall menu changed slightly but mostly the same but some noticeable changes to some of our favorite.   The taste and texture of the dishes mostly did change, not quite as good, definitely not as familiar.   Most alarming, I asked the new manager for some chili oil which I did not see on any tables. The manager told me to hold while he would grab some Sriracha...? I asked again for traditional chili oil and he responded to me that Sriracha is better.... whatever! If I can't get chili oil for my dumplings and dim sum dishes then I would rather not go that the restaurant.   I hoping the new(old?) management have worked out all it bugs and maybe the food prep as well as. I will try this place again because I am pulling for Dim Sum and want to have at lease some descent dim sum in Charlotte.",

If you are avoiding the specific dim sum menu, I  would steer away from the traditional American-Chinese dishes and ask the staff if they have any specials that aren't listed on the menu. Go with their recommendations and you'll probably have a great experience. I had a great dandelion dish there this past spring that wasn't advertised. The service is really good.

All I ordered was fried rice meal, simple Chinese food, not difficult, nothing hard about it. We've been here 35-40 min, the other table just sat 15 min ago is enjoying their food. Then they bring back the undercooked dish and ask again what the problem is with it. At this point we said just bring us the bill! Were done. They take off the two items of hers that they didn't bring and that was undercooked, not the inedible one that was all grizzly. And the food she did eat she said was flavorless, had to drown it in soy sauce to eat it. So one time is enough, no second chance here!",

I must also note that when the owner moved us to a corner table, he ensured the carts would come out way. He even returned to our table and asked us what he needed and brought it right over. Great customer service on his part! My husband and I order takeout from here all the time and have yet to run into any issues.",

Take it off please cus that was disgusting. . We ordered at least 8 dishes. And also I didn't feel like my beef crepes was fully cooked. (One of my favs!) after knowing the shui mai was undercooked I just didn't feel safe eating the other items. ALSO...! They didn't have the pecking duck! (BBQ roasted duck). Such a disappointment dim sum visit. This place used to be my fav spot for dim sum until the recent new management.",

    "text": "This used to be one of my favorite places to go on the weekends when I lived in Plaza Midwood area.  When I moved to another city and we came back to visit, this was my go-to place.  I don't know why I never wrote a review because I really like the dim sum here.  And this place has definitely undergone some changes since we lived here before - an updated interior that looks cleaner and new owners, apparently.    Unless something has changed, you can order dim sum from the menu on weekdays, but on the weekends they have the carts.  This is my favorite because you can see what they're offering and make a decision that way.  They have some pretty dumplings (I like their shrimp ones in particular) and meat dishes, but two things in particular are my go-to dishes.  Their sticky rice is hands down my favorite rice dish ever.  I like that it's a little sweet, has little bits of flavorful meat in the middle, and has a terrific flavor to it from the lotus leaf it's wrapped in.  The sesame bun is my other favorite.  The texture is light and the filling is a little sweet and nutty from the sesame.  We like to try interesting things, which are sometimes a miss for us, but overall most of their dishes we have tried are good.  The only problem is that it is so easy to find yourself with too many dishes and end up with a large bill if you don't watch it.    When we came on around noon on a Saturday, the carts started coming quickly and the food on them was plenty warm and fresh.  It wasn't too busy so the service was pretty good.  Everyone was friendly and we had a good experience.  I'm not sure how good the service is when they get busy, as I generally come when I know it's less busy.  I really like Dim Sum, particularly when they have the cart out on the weekend.",

I get to look, pick and they pull. It's fairly cheap per plate. Anywhere from $1.50 to $3.25 per small plate. Of course you can order something off the menu. Like we ordered the whole lobster made in a delicious sinfully yummy garlic sauce. Hot tea has a big flower in it so it's not jasmine tea. I also have notice their customer service have improved alot over the years. Not when they're alway soo busy on Sat/Sunday. If you just sit around and chit/chat, they will literally completely clean your table as a hint hint to show you, hey you got to go.. There's ppl waiting for your table. Lol.. I love this place..

    "text": "I think I made a terrible mistake and ordered Americanized -Chinese food from a Dim Sum Restaurant.    We ordered two extra-crispy General Tso's Chicken with added rice (one white, one fried) and an egg roll. They do not serve combos here so our two entrees came to about $23. There was a lot of food - but it was a little pricier than some of the other fast food Chinese take-out places. I don't mind paying extra if it's tasty- and it really wasn't that much more in terms of price.   It was hands down the worst Chinese I have ever tasted. The rice had a rancid flavor - it smelled and tasted quite bad so my husband graciously offered his white rice to me. The base of fried rice is white rice so I doubt it was the rice itself but whatever they put in it was not appetizing. The chicken was soggy, sugary-sweet (tasted like a very spicey sweet and sour sauce, it was even bright red in color) ...it didn't taste like any General Tso's I have tasted before. I barely ate my dinner and because it was take-out I wasn't able to give management a chance to fix it unfortunately.   There were a couple of highlights ...the staff went the extra step to attempt to keep the crispy texture and did not sauce the chicken until we picked up our dinners, which was very thoughtful of her. They also have a really delicious homemade eggroll. It was oily but you know what it had actual meat and veggies inside of it and that made me happy.   Overall I just can't bring myself to come back for take-out, but I was told the Dim Sum on Sundays is delicious so I may give that a shot in six months once I forget about that rice that will haunt my dreams.",

Second, there was a really long hair coiled around a fried dumpling just under the skin and was clearly visible from the outside. I called over the waitress to bring it to her attention and she simply grabbed the plate and left. There was no apology or acknowledgement of the tainted food. We weren't sure if she was going to bring us a new batch or comp the charge so we just ended up waiting for an eternity before she came back.  She brought three new dumplings, but my group was too disgusted with the food and the service to even look at them. We asked for the check and another lady (I assume a manager) came to speak with us. She asked us if everything was okay and if there were any problems. She made it seem like the hair incident hadn't been brought to her attention so I mentioned that there was a hair in our food. She rudely answered that she already knew this. So...why did you ask us if we had any problems if you already knew about the issue?? Nevertheless, she gave us a thoughtless, mechanical apology and comped us for only one of the two orders of dumplings even though we didn't eat either of the orders.  All in all, I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation and I will definitely not be back.",

The ambience is simple (like most Chinese restaurants I've ever seen) and it's True you will see a lot of Chinese people dining here, which is always a vote of confidence in my book.  You can also get take-out, which is usually what I do, and enjoy your gluttony in privacy.  So back to the food, after reminiscing a second.  Summertimes growing up we used to visit relatives in San Francisco and eat dim sum in Chinatown.  Short of traveling halfway around the world, I have to think that dining in a big-city Chinatown restaurant is about as authentic as it gets.  When I moved to Charlotte I was so happy to find a restaurant that served this cuisine and thought it was amazing--the variety, the authenticity, and the overwhelming yumminess!  But a part of me doubted my judgment since maybe my childhood pork bun memories are hazy.  Recently I went back to San Fran and had dim sum, lots of different dishes, and I thought, \"Huh, this tastes exactly like the one in my neighborhood.\"  Score for Plaza Midwood and Charlotte!  So if you love dim sum, but have wondered if this could be any good, try it!",

Also, I don't eat pork and when a fried taro dish came out with pork in it the server I realized that I couldn't eat it, told me that it contained pork and then went and got me the same dish made with shrimp instead, which I appreciated.

She came back and start seating these 2 pplz came after us. And then another lady came to ask how many we have. While I was telling her 2 pplz, the previous walked back and seat these 4 pplz just walk in.  So I asked her is there supposed to be a line. She was like no, they seat according to table. I was like I understand if the table fit 10, then u don't want to use it for 2 pplz. However if the table fit 4, I expected to be seat before other pplz that just walk in.  The dim sum is not the best, but it'll do for Charlotte. It's just that lady just ruined my whole mood to eat there, so we walk out and decided to try Krazy Fish down the road.

    "text": "Our family was visiting Charlotte and I had an enormous craving for dim sum.  Especially since the dim sum offerings in Pittsburgh leave quite a bit to be desired.  We stopped in on a weekday for lunch so that means that you can have dim sum if you want, but you have to order off a menu instead of picking off a steam cart.  The steam cart and the delicious desserts are for the weekends only.  Darn.  However, even though we had to order off the menu, everything ... and I mean EVERYTHING ... we ordered was delicious.  Not one clunker amongst the bunch.  So, here's what we ordered:  Siu Mai (pork and shrimp dumplings, steamed) Stuffed bean curd (fried tofu with shrimp) Pork bun (steamed)  Sharkfin dumpling - perfect Fried dumpling - also perfect Spring roll (chicken) - yep, perfect Sesame ball - my kids loved this  Again, everything we ordered was excellent and the service was quite attentive and cheerful.  Our pre-tip total came to $32 for our family of 4.  I wish I lived closer to this little gem of a place.  But for tourists who ended up here thanks to Yelp, this was a highlight for me on this trip!",

    "text": "So, obviously, I'm one of those people who doesn't learn from their mistakes.  This time, instead of going into the restaurant for dim sum, we ordered Chinese takeout.  The soups were meh.  Neither the wonton nor the hot and sour soup had much flavor.    Next came the entrees.  For our family dinner night, we ordered Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken entrees.  Neither of the kids cared much for the Sweet & Sour Chicken.  They said it \"tasted funny.\"  They didn't even want to put on the sweet, sticky red sauce that came in a big container on the side.  And what kid doesn't love that?  That's never been an issue before.  My partner had the Orange Chicken which looked and tasted like chicken covered in the exact same red sweet & sour sauce.  He, too, was not thrilled.  Mine was the Sesame Chicken.  It, too, came in what looked like the EXACT SAME red sweet & sour sauce with a few (a very few) sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  I've never had Sesame Chicken that wasn't in a flavorful BROWN sauce and covered in sesame seeds.  Mine, too, was practically flavorless.  The accompanying rice they gave us was pretty dry and sticky.  Lastly, there were no fortune cookies to finish off a below-average meal.    To top it all off, the restaurant had apparently significantly raised the prices on everything since the last take-out menu we had on hand.  So, when picking up the order, we paid more than expected and the quality was practically non-existent.    Dim Sum is OFF our list FOREVER for both take-out and dine-in.  As our once-president once said, \"Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me... You can't get fooled again.\"",

Their dim sum wasn't fresh anymore. How would I know? 1. I inherited my parents' (my father used to be a chef) canine-like nose and taste, so I definitely know when something isn't fresh. 2. I've been to NYC and Atlanta, so if you want fresh dim sum then you have to try those places first and then tell me if Dim Sum is still good or not.   I'm not trying to be mean, but this place isn't authentic anymore. I think due to the change in clientele that this place americanized their dim sum.   I'm definitely will not be plan on going back for any reason. I think I'll stick with my random trips to Atlanta and get dim sum there.",

We tried sliced pork, meatballs, shrimp noodle, shrimp and bacon wrap, fried dumpling, and something like oxtails.. I would recommend for those who are looking to try something new. It is definitely not Americanized so if you don't like traditional flavors then this place isn't for you.",

While the remodeling improved the appearance what was most heartening was the improved quality of the dim sum!  What once was good was now great!  A nice variety of genuine just made dim sum.  And now they have added the traditional carts on the weekend which is the ideal way to graze and explore.  The dim sum is well priced although they do charge for the tea which is a slight annoyance.   The staff is enthusiastic and work hard to provide a good customer experience.  The parking in front of the testament is a tight squeeze so you might do better parking on the side. The previous management used to feature Peking Duck and I noticed it was no longer on the menu.  After such s great lunch I was thinking ahead to trying that.  The owner/manager when asked about this when I was at the cash register paying explained that sometimes the ducks wouldn't sell and the meat was to o dry to use the next day.  I only wish that they would let you order it 24 hours in advance.  I will suggest this next visit.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Sorry for the long review.  I have never been more mad about a restaurant experience.  This was my second time back at this restaurant.  I had a good experience the first time so we decided to come back because I love dim sum.  It's always hard to find a restaurant that serves authentic dim sum.  We came on mothers days, we knew that there would be some sort of wait but we did not expect the down right terrible experience.  Please keep in mind that the restaurant was half full and  we only saw two waitresses the whole time.  Our wait was over two hours and our order was not completed. The dim sum was not on a cart and instead it was ordered from a menu.  We ordered some dim sum plates and some regular plates like fried rice.  The waitress didn't even bother writing down our order.  I wrote our order on our paper menu and gave it to her.  It took 45 minutes for us to get water and this is only after I got up and notified the manager.  My seat was facing the kitchen so I could see them scooping our water out of a white painters bucket.  Then 1 hour and a half later some of the food arrived.  At the 2 hour mark we decided to leave and not wait on the rest of the food.  The waitresses were rude and had an attitude.  They told us that they had a large queue in front of us.  This would have been fine but we saw a couple come in after us and get served with drinks and food immediately.  During our time at the restaurant we watched several parties walk out, we heard complaints about the wait, dirty tables were not being cleaned, and complaints about the bills being wrong.  Our bill was wrong and the waitress at the cashier was insistent we got all of it.  Avoid at all cost.",

We found out they re-opened, and it's better than it was before! Clean dining room, same friendly staff, and delicious dishes!  We went on a Sunday afternoon and once we were seated, we immediately were greeted with a food cart with dim sum, steamed buns, fried calamari, and more! As you choose items from the cart, they make note on a piece of paper on your table.   Start by choosing a few items from the cart. As you finish those, they'll be back by to offer more, and you can choose as little or as much as your hunger tells you. When you're finished, simply take your ticket up to the front counter to pay.   I believe the food cart is a Sunday-only feature, but if you go during another time, you won't be disappointed with the standard menu!",

For starters, this place has a completely new look. I wish I had taken pictures of the interiors. It looks very nice and clean.  We went in for dim sum during brunch. Last weekend was their first weekend open and the wait was over an hour so we left and came back early today. We were promptly seated. The dim sum carts were rolling in very frequently and they had all of the good stuff - har dow, leek dumpling, shrimp balls, chicken feet, shrimp crepe, siu mai, Chinese broccoli etc. We got one of each (and two of the leek dumplings because they are SO good) and were happy to know the taste hadn't changed at all. The chili oil was also the good ol' kind that's made in-house and has been consistently amazing over the years. We also ordered the house special ho fun because that was our other favorite thing to order here, but that tasted different. Firstly it didn't have the beef-pork-chicken, but instead had shrimp and scallops. Also, it used to be a brown sauce with bok choy in it, but today's was a white sauce with asparagus. Oh well, it was still really good.  I am just happy that this place reopened. If you haven't been here yet, consider this your second chance and give it a try!",

    "text": "I LOVE this restaurant for Saturday/Sunday afternoon dim sum service.  I have never eaten here for a regular lunch or dinner - this review is specific to their dim sum service only.  Dim sum is a style of chinese cuisine served in bite-sized portions in small steamer dishes or on small plates.  Each dish usually comes with 3 - 4 pieces, ideal for sharing.    Dim Sum is located on Central Avenue.  When you first pull in the parking lot, you may have second thoughts. The lot is full of pot holes and the building is a non-descript concrete square.  But, if you continue looking around, you'll notice the parking lot is probably full and there may be a line out the door - this place is a treasure!  On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, they serve traditional dim sum service.  Once you are seated, be prepared for your meal to begin quickly.  Servers with carts will come around and offer you what is available.  They will lift the lid of each dish to show you the food, if you don't know what it is - just ask!    Each cart has a loose theme:    The steamer cart - full of steamed dumplings and buns.  From this cart, I really like to get the pork siu mai (shoo my) - open-topped dumpling with ground pork and spices; pork steamed bun - bready bun filled with savory pork and sauce; and the leek and shrimp dumplings - shrimp and leek in a fully enclosed dumpling.  You may also like the sticky rice - this is a bundle of rice with pork and chicken bits cooked in and wrapped in a lotus leaf.   From here you can also get steamed chicken feet and pork spare ribs.   The paste cart - this cart has shrimp and other meats that are wrapped in white, gelatinous noodles -- that look like paste.  I don't care for the texture of these items, so I wave this cart on.  The open-plate cart - this is my favorite!  On here you have items that are not steamed - they may be fried, pan seared or sauteed.  Hands-down favorite item is the stuffed eggplant with a fried shrimp mixture in it; I also like the leek dumpling and the taro root dumpling filled with pork and shrimp mixture.  The chinese brocolli, squid and spare ribs are also very good.   This is a delightful way to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon with family/friends.  Go, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Went on a Sunday afternoon for Dim Sum @ Dim Sum.  Weekends are always fun, because they have the carts circling the restaurant and you get to pick and choose what you want.  This was my second time here and the first time I would have rated it a 3/5 as the food was all 'Okay' and on the greasy side.  Hit the spot, but wasn't anything special.  This past Sunday was my first time after they re-opened and I was much impressed.  FOOD - 4/5 - Good selection of dim sum and everything we had was somewhere between good and great.  This isn't \"Best thing I've ever had\" type food, it's more for comfort food (al beit not traditional), variety, and nostalgia.  We had the sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf (I think), shu mai, chicken feet, pork buns, roast duck, those shrimp rolls (the white ones that come with sauce), and pineapple buns.  The sticky rice, shrimp rolls, and duck were stand outs.  Duck is on the fatty side, which I prefer, but certainly a preference.  Pork buns were quite disappointing.  As a staple and the most approachable for non-dim sum eats, it was dry with very little filling.      Ambiance 4/5 (not that it's fancy, but it lives up to expectations) - The ambiance is exactly what I'd expect from a dim sum restaurant.  If I walk in to a dim sum place and I see Edison Bulbs and fancy tile work, I'm walking out.  This had everything I expect from dim sum:  drop ceilings, cheap metal framed chairs with vinyl cushions, and the push carts.    Price - 3/5 - Not expensive by any stretch, but most Charlotte restaurants can't push the volume to have low prices.  We paid about $41 for two people and we were full.  Service - 4/5 - Carts were prompt, no problem paying or getting a take out box.  As long as I get my food, service isn't that important to me at Dim Sum.",

The parking lot was packed on a recent weekend but we only waited about 20 minutes.   Dim sum comes around on carts. There were three different carts recently. All with different options. They do have a full Chinese food menu but you'll need to request it. You can ask what's in each dim sum or just be surprised.   You bring your yellow slip up front and pay there.   All in all not bad Chinese food for North Carolina. Tasted very similar so what I've had in Hong Kong and China. Prices are reasonable.",

No the dim sum is not as good as in San Fran or NYC china towns, but this is Charlotte ( I mean our claim to culinary fame is Price's Chicken coop). I personally thought the Shu Mai (shrimp and pork dumplings) were very comparable to what Ive had in San Fran, and the steamed pork buns were also very good. I was craving Dim Sum and this place did not let me down. I will say that I was hoping they would have a Dim Sum cart going around so you could pick and choose from what looked good, but they did have pictures alongside of some of the dim sum to help in the selection process.",

So let me just say that the rating is more based on the experience then the actual quality of the food (I don't feel confident to judge the food since it was my first dim sum experience).  The menu and tables smelled strongly of dirty dish rags, and I think it was the patrons next to us that smelled like human excrement (not Dim Sum's fault, I know, but it makes it very difficult to maintain an appetite).  We ordered a variety of appetizers with the main courses to follow...  The appetizers were really mushy, and the combination of mushy food and the mix of dirty smells made both our stomachs upset, so we got the main courses boxed - we couldn't get out  of there fast enough.  I had a bite of the main courses at home but I threw out the food right after the first bite because I couldn't stop thinking about what just happened.  We will probably never return. The experience gets a two instead of a one because the waitress was very very nice.",

Tasty little suckers.  Not quite like being in Chinatown in NYC but for Charlotte, it's as close as you can get.  They celebrate Chinese New Year the first Sunday in February and two years ago, there was this evil white dude sitting on top of the restaurant throwing firecrackers down on the performers.  What the ?!?  But I guess he knew the owners because they saw him and let him keep doing it.  By the way, you can get in and out of this place in about 5 minutes.  Everything is super fast.  It gets really busy at around 12 noon on Sunday, so go a bit early or on the late side.  And the kiddies get free lollipops after the meal.",

I am obsessed over Hot & Sour soup so yeah...it DOESN'T really taste like hot & sour soup...but it IS SO good! 2.94$ for a small bowl, I really recommend it...It comes with the fried noodle you put in. BTW their fortune cookies they give out at the end doesn't have trans fat. Plus they were sooo good, unlike the typical fortune cookies given here in CA. I am not exaggerating .  Besides that, me and my friends got steamed buns...they were OK. Staff are super friendly and memorable, despite the fact that we just ordered soup and steamed buns and didn't take any recommendations (we had to eat steak in a few hrs so..). I wish I could try more things..the menu look so tasty and the soups tasted really high quality.  Would pay for an NC ticket again to come back!",

Of course, just coming back from LA, my expectation was much higher but even so, the food seems below par even with Charlotte standards. I went with two friends on a Saturday at around 1:30 PM. It was definitely too late for dim sum but we avoided the crowds because I have seen it packed on the weekends. Like some other reviewers, the place was not dressed to impressed but the service was okay. My two friends never had dim sum before so I was real excited to show off a piece of my culture . . . they weren't too impressed. Sucks!   So the fun thing about dim sum is being able to see the food on a cart before you order the items. There were only three carts in the restaurant and the workers seemed ready for a break because after coming by one time, they stopped and we have to wave at them to get them to come by.   The food was lukewarm which sucks because many of the items become oily such as the spare ribs and the Phoenix feet. The Sui Maai, and Ha Gaau were decent. The Ha Cheung was very good (my friend's favorite) but the Lo Mei Gai is a no go. The sesame balls were were worth ordering but the pineapple baau was so-so. The taste of everything was decent but perhaps because it was later in the day, it was not as fresh and hot as it should be. So I am going to have to go with a TWO because I've experienced better here.",

I actually bought my house in the neighborhood because we kept passing the Dim Sum place and I asked the realtor \"hey, what's up that street in front of the Dim Sum\" and there was my house, For Sale By Owner, I'd never have found it if it weren't for Dim Sum.  And when I moved in and my refrigerator didn't get delivered for 10 days, they pretty much fed me daily.  I was hooked.  Five years later, I still go there all the time, and every friend or family member who comes to town gets taken there.  I've never had anything that wasn't good.  Dim Sum on Saturday and Sunday mornings, with the little carts going full steam, is of course the big draw, but you can order most of the little dim sum treats any time you come in there.  Every now and then the waitresses will tell me that I should try some special dish.  I got a lamb hotpot that way that I've never seen on the menu since.",

It looked like something they had previous steamed and it was left over that was resteemed. Second, the rest of their dumpling was just aokay. I order the fried crispy rice noodle crepe. And it eventually never made it out. The manager apologized profusely, which was very kind of her. But nonetheless it doesn't makeup for less than average dim sum. The weird thing is on the weekends, I feel like it tastes better because it is more fresh. And another pet peeve of mine is when the food comes out at different times.

    "text": "As I stepped off the plane  in Charlotte I had one thought on my mind... dumplings. I had recently attended a conference in Seattle (Podcon) and tried soup dumplings for the first time. My life was forever changed. But I was saddened to discover the Din Tai Fung only had 4 locations in the entire United States. None of those locations were on the east coast.   So it is with this pioneer spirit in mind that my wife and I set out to explore our local cuisine for some sort of substitute. I put \"dumplings\" into the Yelp! app and it returned with a few results. Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant was one of the first on the list. We went about 2 pm on a weekday and it was basically empty.  They have a menu with pictures of the various appetizer dishes that you check off and they bring them to you. We tried as much as we could fit into our stomachs before getting way too full. We had to bring the rest home. We ordered so much food and it still came to less than $50 for both of us.  A few days later our adventurous spirit returned and we found ourselves in Dim Sum once again. This time it was a Sunday afternoon and the experience was completely different.   The place was packed. Everyone was talking in languages we didn't understand with our ignorant American minds. When we sat down this time they brought around carts full of delicious foods already prepared. And we just picked which items we wanted off the cart and they put it right on the table. It was like a dim sum buffet that comes around to your table.   We tried all sorts of things we'd never had before. Even Chicken Feet. What do chicken feet taste like? Chicken. The wait staff was attentive and made sure we knew what we were ordering if we had any questions. This place felt so authentic to the Asian community that I felt like a tourist in my own city. Thank you Dim Sum staff for welcoming us into your home.  I love this place and will definitely return.",

Back a couple years ago, I would not recommend this place, then it changed ownership and it got worse. Fortunately, the current owner made serious investment and this place was renovated I think about a year ago and it now becomes a much better place. Better and more consistent food quality, improved service and to top it all, a cleaner and much improved atmosphere. From the outside it may look the same but once you are inside, you can feel the coziness of the place. we went for brunch with the traditional dim sum menu. The only thing I feel they should do is to serve congee/porridge. That's a major item that I miss in this dimsum place, otherwise, the rest of the item was great.",

Their meat... you can smell the stink-ness of the meat. We gave up eating those and tried to give other entrees chances. All the food were just smelled really bad and our experience were not the best.   The service: 2/5  There were two waitresses and they werent the nicest. They kept speaking in chinese and we were so clueless. We can tell there were so clashes between those waitresses fighting over us. It was unpleasant. We wont go back until they fix their customer services and their meat.",

I called the waitress. The waitress took a picture of that meal and took away quickly. Everything seemed to be fine at that time. I was still regreting for not taking the picture as proof. The waitress that served me is a mid-age asian lady with short hair. She took off 3 dollars for that dish I ordered and didn't even say sorry. She said \"that dish is the only one has a fly, if you get a fly in every of your meal, you can eat for free.\" WTF??? Please imagine about the tone she used and that really pissed me off. I asked for the picture of the FRIED FLY as a proof since I want to write this review. She said\"I am calling the police.\" WHAT???? Did I demand something that unrealistic? I paid everything for that meal except that FLY. I even willing to pay 5 dollars for that DELICIOUS FLY if I can get a picture of that. They refused.  If you want to eat Chinese meals and unfortunatly walk into this one. God bless you.  A review wrote on toilet.",

Since I don't eat dim sum too often, I never really know what to order so having pictures helped us a lot.   Between the three of us, we ordered 2 dishes (1 vegetable + 1 noodle entree) and 9 dim sums ($3.50 each). We had leftovers from the dishes because the dumplings we ordered filled us up. I definitely recommend their beef chow fun.   Service was decent and food came out within a reasonable time. I will be back!",

We were seated right away and greeted to put our order in.  I ordered crab rangoon, pork bun, steamed dumplings and egg drop soup.  Sadly, I only liked the pork bun.  The rangoon was terribly rich.  Greasy, creamy and rich. I could only have one, and with that, felt ill.  The dumplings were just ok.  The came with sauce on top, nothing to dip...and a HUGE wad of meat inside...might be good for someone, ugh...but not me.  The egg drop soup had an odd flavor and I only ate one bite.  The pork bun was good.  Tasty meat inside, just the right amount and perfect bun.  The restroom was hideously dirty.  I mean disgusting!  Avoid it at all costs.  The overall restaurant was not bad...it looked clean and pretty organized.    The service was good.  The prices were entirely ridiculous for what you got. I spent over $30 on appetizers that is disliked.  Will probably not come back, but you live and you learn.",

    "text": "I've been in Charlotte for almost a month now, and have only experienced one great disappointment: that there are only two dim sum restaurants in the entirety, AND that they're both half an hour away from me. Why, Dim Sum? Why?  Now it seems besides the Dragon Court (which doesn't seem to be wowing people either), the Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is all I have left. Le sigh.   Alright, lament aside and review on, this place did not dress to impress. Outside looked pretty sketch, and upon walking in there, the cook and what looked like the manager were sitting down watching tv. They seemed to be able to afford the down time because there wasn't a soul in the house. I waited awkwardly by the counter, then said, \"Excuse me,\" three times to no avail. Then suddenly, for some reason, the chef looked up, barked something and a waitress came out with my order.  First things first: if you are a full-time Dim Sum restaurant, you need to have some staples that come with availability. All sweet items are done ONLY on weekends. This includes the custard tarts, coconut rolls, fried pineapple rolls, ANYTHING that resembles a dessert, and one of the biggest staples of dim sum and one of my personal favorites, zha leung cheung fun, also known as Chinese fried dough wrapped in rice noodle. I know how this may sound, but for those of you who have experienced a good zha leung cheung fun, you know what I'm talkin'bout.   That taken off my order, I almost decided to wait for the weekend, BUT I was only 15 out of the thirty minutes away in a car with no air conditioning - I may as well tough the damn thing out. Also up on the list: pork and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet.   This is my usual dim sum test. Something I like and is easy (dumplings), something I hadn't tried before (shrimp balls), and... the feet. You can always tell how good a dim sum place is going to be by their chicken feet. In this case, the chicken feet were cooked moderately well, but had no seasoning whatsoever and what little sauce there was was very bland. The meat in the dumplings tasted good, but had an odd texture of not ground, but pureed. It took me a couple to get used to it. The shrimp balls were huge, and delicious. However, the outside was soggy instead of the crunchy I was hoping for.   All in all, hoping for a better dim sum experience. Now all I can do is place my hope in the Dragon Court. Wish me luck.",

No, but this is Charlotte, so come on people. The char siu bow is awesome and only available on weekends, as are the other baked items.  We were there on a Sunday around noon, and it filled up quickly, but the carts were moving the entire time and we didn't have to wait for our favorites to make their way around.  The menu items looked really good as they were being delivered to the tables around us--not your typical Americanized deep fried stuff. I'll be going back for sure.",

These are my go to grabs from the cart: - Chinese Broccoli (ask for extra sauce) - Fried Taro - Shumai (shrimp, but all are good) - Fried Tofu w/shrimp - Shrimp in rice noodle (beef is good too) - Pork BBQ - sticky rice in lotus leaf  As for a tea: go for a traditional  Chrysanthemum tea (flower tea).  Service is quick, i've been seated right away all the time so far. Staff is friendly and they come around frequently and even grab you a dish they may not have on the cart, if you ask.

    "text": "I finally dragged my hubby and son to try some Dim Sum...and well!  We hit the restaurant during the peak hours, at around 6:30 pm, and there were only about 3 tables full...so no wait.   Unfortunately, some disappointments. Realized that they only feature traveling Dim Sum carts during brunch hours on Saturday and Sunday...not in the evenings! Sadly, we had to order strictly from the menu, which also seemed smaller than usual (?). Then, when my son wanted to order the Beef Teriyaki off the regular menu, he was told that they were out of that apps. They were also out of one of my Dim Sum of choice. Also, except for their Eggplant Dim Sum, there was no other veggie Dim Sum...so we ended up eating a ton of carbos and proteins.   Most of the Dim Sum tasted pretty good...at least for me. My husband complained a bit about the texture of some Dim Sum (too oooey gooey doughy?), and my finicky son didn't even try all the Dim Sum ordered. So no, they weren't thrilled with the foods, but liked it OK. At least they now have tried Dim Sum.  Service was fairly quick...and generally better than last time I was here (with a big group of friends). However, in order to get tea refills or napkins or whatever, you have to flag down the lone waitress (or the manager/owner) on duty.   The place also seemed cleaner and cooler (AC, that is!) than last time, but just like last time, very lackluster and bland. First of all, it's just way too quiet...almost dead silent, minus the sound of silverware. They definitely need some overhead music! Also, like I might have mentioned last time, the place could use some color...and more wall decor. I just thought that the overall ambiance was too boring with its beige/ivory walls and the most barest of decorations.  Lastly, the bill. The items we ordered weren't fully listed, but just the number of items (which, frankly, we haven't kept track of...so who knows if the listing was even accurate??). Well, thankfully, the pricing of Dim Sum wasn't too bad, especially for the tremendous amount of foods we had. I did learn that next time, I need to keep better track of everything we ordered and received, as well as billed.     Overall, it was just OK at best. Like I said, the place wasn't conducive to a thrilling experience and the Dim Sum options weren't optimal (no carts even!). Still, this is the only full scale Dim Sum restaurant in Charlotte. I personally LOVE Dim Sum, so am glad they're here. Guess now I know not to go for Dim Sum in the evenings.",

    "text": "Three stars on Yelp supposedly means \"A-OK,\" which sounds like a wonderful compliment.  But Yelp is all about grade inflation, and the reality is that an overall three-star rating on Yelp puts a restaurant easily below Yelp par.  It means that the restaurant is getting hammered by way too many one-and-two-star reviews, which obviously means it's displeasing quite a few people.   Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant currently has a three-star rating.  Ouch.  That almost steered us somewhere else, but we wanted dim sum and this apparently is the only formal sit-down dim sum game in town.  Plus, neither of us had been to dim sum in way too long, even though it's a food experience I almost always love.  So when I say I was pleasantly surprised by Dim Sum and its dim sum, it was against this dubious background.    The restaurant looks a little seedy from the outside, but the interior is sharp and clean enough.  The low ceilings might bring out the claustrophobia in a few folks.  We were seated at a corner table, which initially seemed like a disaster because the carts weren't making it back there for the first 15 or 20 minutes.    But when they did, most of the dim sum we ordered was pretty satisfying.  All the stuff in the steel steamer baskets--turnip cakes, various dumplings (har gow, a chive dumpling, and one or two other porky ones), shrimp rice noodle roll, sticky rice--seemed like it was at least was piping hot, seemed fresh enough, and was at least of average dim-sum quality (and least when you're talking about a metro like Charlotte that's not well represented by Chinese food).  And even average means that I'm pretty satisfied when it comes to dim sum.  Unfortunately, the stuff not in steamer baskets--Chinese broccoli and some pan-fried or griddled pot-stickers--was room temperature or colder.  Not good.    We ate a lot, and our check was over 40 bucks, which is actually a bit high for dim sum.  When you talk about the amount of protein and preparation involved in dim sum, though, people's expectations about dim sum prices are pretty unreasonable when you get right down to it.  3.5 stars, rounded up.",

Asked for a bowl of rice. Never got it. No one came by to ask how we were doing. Asked for black vinegar - said they don't have it. Then the ONE lady worth anything gave me the black vinegar that I know they had. The staff is much younger than before and I overheard their conversations about school, homework and gossip. Went to checkout and there's no greeting from the girl at the register. Nothing but a bored face waiting for us to hurry up and leave so they could get back to gossiping.   The ONE lady who has always worked there is the only reason they got two stars instead of one. Never coming back here. I hope management smartens up and does some quality hiring.",

We only got to try a handful of items because there were just two of us, but we definitely want to go back as a group and try more things on the menu.  All the dim sum was good. Our favorite thing we had, though, was definitely the Chinese vegetables. They were phenomenal!  If you want the dim sum via push cart style, come early on a Sunday. Otherwise they'll likely be doing dim sum via menu ordering.",

    "text": "So, the pictures looked appealing for this Dim Sum restaurant but though the food looked as it should, it sure did not taste right.    First off, what a mess when it comes to getting a table.  We walked in and there were 10 or more open tables. 7 or more of those tables were dirty with one girl bussing tables very inefficiently (I worked in a Chinese restaurant from age 8 to adulthood, so I would know).  They would randomly seat parties of 3 at large 6 top tables and and make larger tables wait while there were plenty of tables for 2-4 people.  Very confusing.   The food was very disappointing.  Having grown up on dim sum food, I wasn't expecting the best from this restaurant but I sure wasn't expecting the worst.  This place was probably one of the worst I've been to in my lifetime.  The staples like Har Gow (shrimp dumplings), Pork Shu Mai (pork dumplings), Chong Fan (rice noodle roll) and Egg Custard all lacked flavor.  The Chong Fan, Chinese Broccoli and Turnip Cake were cold.  They weren't even lukewarm.  Simply cold.  The sauce on the Chinese Broccoli was extremely watered down as if they put oyster sauce with water and thickened it up with corn starch.  Not right.  The Turnip Cake was too cold to taste good and the Beef Chong Fan was cold and very firm with no flavor at all.  Everything else we ordered lacked flavor.  The only decent dishes were the Sticky Rice wrapped in Banana Leaf and the Cha-Sui Bao (BBQ Pork Buns).  The egg custard had the right texture and flaky crust but the custard itself also seemed watered down.  Very sad.   Service wasn't good, we saw our waitress a couple times during our entire visit and ended up asking the help of other staff for assistance.  Will I go back? No.  Would I recommend to anyone? No.  But hey at least I can say I gave it a try.",

The staff are extremely friendly, but unfortunately this place was not worth your money. We paid $43 for three people, we ordered 9-10 dishes. Though the staff is friendly, the food is definitely not worth a cent. You can go to the closest Asian market and buy better frozen dimsum that what you get at this restaurant.  I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. The food was cold and dry. We got there, ordered, ate and within 10-15 minutes we bolted out.   We couldn't wait to get out!!",

I did notice some saying the food is still bland, but I really wanted Dim Sum and decided to give this place a chance.  I was not impressed with the Dim Sum food. It is not horrible, but it is nothing special. Neither the flavor nor the texture impressed me. Houston's Dim Sum is much better. However, I did enjoy the Seafood Fried Noodle dish. It was so delicious, filling, crunchy, and saucy.  The service: My family and I were seated after standing around aimlessly for a bit. There was one server standing behind a table who looked up at us when we walked in then ignored us. All of the servers pushing carts were nice except for one... we asked for fried calarmi, she didn't put it on our table or mark it on our card, and when we repeated that we wanted it, she -- visibly annoyed -- said \"I thought you said you didn't want it!!!\" Why would we repeat our request if we didn't want it? She impatiently placed it on our table, marked it on our card, then stormed off... is it that serious? Please listen to your customers instead of engaging in unnecessary interactions. We would like to eat in peace... everyone else was kind.  Prices are decent. I came with two family members and our bill was $27 prior to tipping: $15 of our bill was from the Seafood Fried Noodle dish and $12 was from Dim Sum. We got a decent amount of Dim Sum, so the food portion to price ratio is good.  We will most likely be looking elsewhere mainly for the lack of flavor in the food. Service can also be improved.",

A group of us were in Charlotte to visit the Billy Graham Library.  We were quite hungry and decided to come here.  FYI - some of the guys are not that adventurous or have a diverse culinary palate.    We arrived and I noticed the lobby was renovated and looked nicer.  We were pleased to see the dim sum carts!  But it was before 3 pm.  Unfortunately since we got there toward the end, the baked pork buns we got were cold along with the siu mai and other dumplings and there other dishes we wanted to order.  We ordered off the menu but were now considered dinner prices since shift change.  Two of the guys ordered lo mein and beef and broccoli though they all did like the pork buns.  Hubby had gotten the beef rice noodles and pork rice noodles along with the beef balls, pork ribs, etc.  If we got there early, perhaps the food would have been better due to temperature.  It was great to see authentic dim sum",

Our friend, a regular at this place, put himself in charge of ordering dim sum for all of us. Knowing he knew his stuff and also too lazy to care, we trusted him. He ordered shrimp shu mai, fried taro dumplings, fried pork dumplings, chicken and pork buns, taro shrimp, and stuffed eggplant.  The fried pork dumplings were much bigger than the ones I'm used to from Prosperity Dumpling back home, but still good. The wrappers were still thin and the filling was legit. I enjoyed the stuffed eggplant, and the shu mai was okay (I am not a huge fan of shrimp shu mai for whatever reason).   Despite that goodness, our meal was a bit disappointing. We asked for chili oil and were told they were out. Needless to say, everyone at the table was upset. Even if they made their own and ran out somehow, they could have hit up any of the 373958 Asian markets on Central (like the one next door!) to get a temporary supply. Later, we learned they did not have any chicken and pork buns, so were given regular pork buns as a substitute. Our taro dumplings, which I usually love, were crispy, but were not cooked through. My friend mused that his was cold. I bit into mine and upon first bite, nearly burnt the roof of my mouth. However, my next bite was lukewarm.   The prices here were okay and the service was good, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype. I would like to give it another chance, but I'm not going to go out of my way to get back there when there are so many other places to eat in this city.",

We ordered 5 Dim Sum dishes, all stuff that couldn't have been bought frozen. All great.  Ordered Singapore Curried Noodles and a crazy large serving of Seafood Hor Fun. Both where fantastic. Also had a couple simple veg dishes that where Wok'd just right.  The place is not very appealing from the street. When you get inside it is very old school Chinese and pretty dated but I like it that way. The d'core was just like most of the places we eat in in South China and South East Asia.  My friends loved the food and especially the authenticity. They liked having \"real\" food for breakfast too. Like I said the Hor Fun was really big!!!!!  If you want a fancy setting go to PF Chang. If you want really authentic and high quality Dim Sum and Cantonese Chinese, this is the place.  It is in my GPS now for my next trip to RTP.",

    "text": "A friend and I visited on a Tuesday afternoon for some Dim Sum. Finally found what I was looking for, some TRUE chinese food (although I was disappointed to see orange chicken on the menu... what a shame). We tried the lotus cakes, steamed pork buns, chicken feet, tripe, shrimp rice noodle crepe, and shui mai. The lotus cakes were delicious as were the steamed pork buns, shrimp rice noodle crepe, and shui mai. The black bean sauce on the chicken feet was good, but I personally think chicken feet are too much of a hassle to eat. This is the first time I have ever had tripe and I will say I am not a fan! But, that is nothing against the way Dim Sum makes it. Overall I will return to satisfy my urge for some chinese food.",

Ma Po Tofu was a souped-up (no pun intended) version of whatever-in black bean sauce. Hot and Sour soup was somewhat impressive, black vinegar flavor shining through, and it wasn't a problem to keep the pork out (which means they're not making it at 10am and letting it sit for umpteen hours). Greens (bok choy, choy sum, etc) are delicious here. Flecks of browned garlic abounding, yay!   But if you're looking for veggie-friendly Dim Sum, you'll need to make special plans. When I inquired, I was told it wouldn't be a problem with a week's notice and a large-ish guest list.    Prices are a bit high, but the staff are sweet and the veg selection good enough to keep me interested.",

So i had come here first (yelp)  to check out the reviews and to see what everyone had liked. So I tried to order some of that to round out our meal. We had ordered a bunch off of the Dim Sum menu and then per Pourinas recommendation had the Chinese Broccoli with the Garlic sauce-Delicious and Fresh it has gone up in price $1 i think but they let you know that upon ordering I was totally fine with it though. Other favorites were the Won Ton Soup- the Won Tons were so good I got one to go for lunch today :) . I also really liked the Taro Shrimp with a lil Soy sauce on them. The Shrimp Dumpling were great along with the Pork Dumplings (HUGE). We had the Sesame Balls which the server said was basically they're dessert during the week because the others aren't served till the weekend...I will be back for more!   My not so favorite but not at any fault of the cooks but because I had never had them before and the texture was all wrong in my mouth I found it hard to swallow...The Turnip Cakes. They were just kinda gooey and a very strange taste if only you could've seen my face...Priceless. We also had the Pork Steamed Buns and also the Steamed Buns with Chicken and Pork....I'm not sure how I felt about them because they came last to the table and I was already getting full so I really only had a bite of each and the only complaint would be that they're was too much bread around the meat but the flavor seemed to be good.  I would say we had a great dinner and we will definitely be back perhaps with others so we can try more! Our server told us to come in on the weekends to take advantage of the carts going around so that we can pick out what we want based on the way they look too! I'm down for this Saturday just so I can have more!!",

The bar was set high because of that most excellent experience.  Since then I've had Dim Sum in San Francisco, New York and DC.  This place is a Charlotte highlight. CAUTION...if you attempt to compare this place to experiences in larger cities you'll be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is, Dim Sum in the CLT.  The food is authentic, fresh and affordable. During the week you  can order Dim Sum style from the menu. On the weekends they roll the carts with traditional fare.  Shaomi, har gow and char siu bau are all excellent. I would also recommend the chicken, pork or shrimp fried rice.  The tea is fair to average. We asked for Jasmine but it wasn't quite up to par.  You will get excellent service any time but expect a wait on weekends.  They have recently upgraded the carpet and fixtures. Business is good.",

Definitely not the best neighborhood, nor is the restaurant the cleanest place in the city, but where else can you find an authentic Dim Sum experience in the Queen city?  Recently went through a renovation (summer '14) and naturally jacked the prices up on their food.  You'll be looking at a lunch bill around $10 if you want to sample a few Dim Sum offerings and are drinking flat water.  Unfortunately, because of this, the value is rather marginal on their offering - it was a mistake in my book.  That said, however, the food itself is tasty and the experience of Dim Sum is unlike your traditional run-of-the-mill offerings around Charlotte, so it's worth a shot.  I'd definitely recommend the leak dumplings, the sticky pork buns, and plenty of that hot/oil/sauce they keep on the table - I eat that stuff straight.",

I brought my boyfriend here who never had dim sum before, he took a few bite and decided he loves this place. They recently did some renovations on the inside and it looks great. The ladies who work there are really nice and speaks English really well. Enjoy your dining experience, I know I did! :)",

My lobster came out way to fast to be chopped up and cooked. Looked kinda old. So basically this place is a no go on food service or anything else.

    "text": "Since they don't have much competition in the Dim Sum category, I thought they could get away with crappy food but actually this place is pretty decent.  The menu items are standard across all dim sum places - I usually base my judgement of dim sum places on their chicken feet, spare ribs, haw gow, and siu mai. All these items were about right. One particular item of note is the fried taro/shrimp patty. The shrimp paste patty is battered with shredded taro and fried. Crispy, shrimpy and tasty.   One thing that I wouldn't order again is the roast pork - barely any flavor and not roasted enough.  The dearth of decent Chinese food in Charlotte has left my standards pretty low. It's pricer than what dim sum should normally be, but again, they can get away with that and it's solid food so I'm willing to pay it.",

    "text": "I've been here several times for a private party (read: custom-ordered dinner) and the food was great. We're still in Charlotte, keep in mind, and I've yet to find anything that blows my mind enough I can brag to my friends back home In Seattle about. I'd settle for a place I wouldn't be hideously embarrassed to bring my dad the retired Master Chef to eat at when he comes to visit. But, at least there is acceptable, even sort of good, Chinese food in Charlotte. Service is good, but the restaurant tables are a little awkwardly situated that you might have to do some waving to get someone's attention.   I came back on New Year's Day for actual dim sum and I was satisfied. The food seems fresh and aside from a little bit greasy (it's restaurant food, after all) and a hint of MSG, it's totally fine by me. The chicken feet were good, the bbq pork buns were fresh and fluffy, pretty much everything was as it should be. The turnip (radish?) cakes were especially tasty and radishy. I wonder if they make it in-house. Other places have it so mushed up you can't barely tell from the texture it was a grated root vegetable.  I would, however, stay away from the rice steam cooked in the leaves. I've never seen anyone serve it this way. Instead of 2 or 3 small ones steamed in a little container, they have one absurdly large one (making it hard to share). They cut a flap of leaf open on the top and they jam a spoon into it for you to scoop it out. It can't work this way! The way the leaf-food works is that when it's piping hot, the rice slides off of the leaf easily when it's opened up. If you let the rice cool down, like, say, by opening a flap in the leaf, then it doesn't come off the leaf. You end up sitting there trying to scrape at the leaf, yielding you some bitter leaf bits stuck to your precious tasty sticky rice.   Bonus points to this place for having hot chrysanthemum tea. They also have jasmine, and pu-er, which are pretty standard to dim sum. I was pleased for a different kind of tea, which happens to be one of my favorites!  I think Dim Sum is worthy of carrying the name. At least for now. I still hope for more authentic and good Chinese in Charlotte. *fingers and chopsticks crossed*",

It is over priced, the service was bad, and the food was honestly awful. 100% salt, no real flavor. Not to mention the sanitation score. The restaurant cleverly disguises their sanitation score of 70 (the absolute lowest score a restaurant can have without legally having to shut its doors immediately) with a large leafy plant. It would be a better value to drive to a neighboring city to satiate those dumpling cravings. You'd be better off heating something up from the frozen section of Trader Joe's. Avoid at all costs.",

They have raised the prices of their specialty dishes and on the receipt it's written In Chinese so I don't know what I'm paying for, and knowing how they are, they are very quick to scam you u prices. With that said.  Dimsum here is FANTASTIC I love the food, I really do crave it but can never eat alone, everytime I go here I have to bring my family or atleast 3-4 friends to help out. Average ticket 250 bucks - 350 bucks but the amount of food that we get is insane! There are so many choices and so many good things I can't help but to order one or two of every dish that they offer! It's spectacular to eat family style meals like that bc your taste buds are gonna be so pleased with everything! Shu Mai, har dow, taro cake, clams with black bean sauce, sea bass fried with ginger soy sauce, Cantonese style lobster! All fantastic! This place I hold dear to me, if they was to closed down. I would be a broken foodie in pain",

Me personally didn't like most of the items we tried.  Some were just too sweet or just too odd tasting for me.  I liked some things but they weren't amazing to me.  I probably would go back though just because of how cool it was with their dim sum.  I definitely recommend experiencing a dim sum at some point!",

When ordering hot tea for one person they give one teapot and charge for one tea. When ordering hot tea for 4 people, they give you one pot and charge for 4 teas. When confronted about this we were ignored.   When we tried to order more food we waited for the waiter for 15 min before we decided to raise our hands to get their attention. That didn't work and we tried to call for the waiter which didn't work also. I eventually had to get up and approach one of the waiters which I think is unacceptable for any restaurant with waiters.  When we got the bill they had already put on a 20% tip. I would have been ok with this if we had gotten service worthy of that much tip. I am unashamed to say that I left enough cash to cover 10%, which is generous relative to the service received that night.   Spend your money elsewhere. It's not worth this kind of treatment.",

I think it just depends on what kind of waitress/waiter you get. Their stuffed fried taros are pretty good and so is the shrimp crepes. Chicken feet and short pork ribs are also good. I come here often because it is one of the few places we have in CLT and because some reviews on some of the other restaurants make me a bit hesitant to try the others. Lol. Enjoy.",

We even ordered fried pork intestines. For those of you who are adventurous, the intestines are worth a try. The outside is crispy with a soft and chewy interior.

    "text": "This is a one of a kind experience for dim sum style dishes in Charlotte. When you enter and see so many Asian diners you know the food is authentic and delicious! I hadn't been there in a while so I was very pleasantly surprised by the redecorated dining room. Bright colors livened up the somber tones of an aging restaurant. There were the usual selections with some newer dishes I hadn't tried before. The steamed dumplings and bao are my personal favorites. Wait staff was cordial and knowledgeable. I hope not to wait as long as before to visit again.",

    "text": "The new Dim Sum is great. All the stuff I ordered at the prior restaurant is still there, same great taste and artful dumpling preparation. The carpet is new, chairs reupholstered, walls painted with new sconces. Gotta say I missed the waitstaff with the ongoing feud who were periodically rude to customers. The family who now seems to be in charge, they were so sweet and professional I hardly knew what to do with myself! We highly recommend the pan fried dumplings and pork roast buns. Thanks Dim Sum for opening back up!",
