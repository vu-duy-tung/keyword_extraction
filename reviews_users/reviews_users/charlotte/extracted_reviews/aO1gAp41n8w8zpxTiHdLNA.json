The beef short ribs..tasty, but nothing to write home about.  My girlfriend and I both had the red beans and rice with roasted turkey....now when you hear roasted turkey what do you think?  I'll wait a minute while you ponder this......well what we got was turkey sausage...it was bizarre.  It was sliced and didn't taste bad, but we were confused.  Actually waited several minutes for our waitress to come back to check on us - we asked if we'd gotten the wrong meals..she said no.  Well, it took her so long to come back that by the time we dug in our food was only warm...now that's on us I guess...but, the food was luke warm and bland.  I never reach for hot sauce..and I reached for it here.  The desserts...now those were on point.  The coconut cake - best i've had beyond Red Rocks.    So to recap:  Food - 2 stars Desserts - 4 stars  For an avg of 3 stars.",

Just a casual restaurant.  We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday and were quickly seated.  After ordering, our food arrived about 10 minutes later.  I had the fried chicken with mac n cheese and greens.  And because I'm greedy and have no shame I also got a side of mashed taters (just so I could try them).  I really enjoyed my food.  It was hot and delicious.  The mac n cheese was very cheesy and satisfying.  The mashed taters were lumpy like I like it.  And the cornbread was good too.  A nice little loaf with some creamy, sweet butter.  I think my meal was about 10 bucks with a drink.   My only complaint is that the portions were kinda small.  Maybe I'm just used to bigger portions in Atlanta, but I could have enjoyed 1/4 more food.  The service was fast and friendly.",

The staff is nice, when you can actually get a hold of them. Be prepared to wait for everything. 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us as we first walked in. Another 10 minutes for our server to greet us. Another 15 minutes for our food to show. Then another 10 minutes to get our check. This is just too slow for me.  The food was good. The cornbread held up to my high expectations; buttery with perfect texture. The BBQ pulled pork had a unique flavor. It is an intense, delicious flavor; but after the first few bites the intensity and vinegar becomes a bit overwhelming. My wife's fried chicken was also good.   Mert's would be a solid 4 star if the service was more attentive. It deserves another visit.",

Today....I had lunch here and ordered the Merts world famous Salmon Cakes. Sadly it appears the Salmon cakes are now Salmon BALLS. The portions appears to be cut in half. To whom it may concern.....we LOVE and adore this dish, however we are disappointed someone has decided to cheat us out of this delicious menu item. I hope my next visit will reveal that someone at Merts has had a change of Heart and their Soul has led them to serve the regular portion we have grown accustom to.....otherwise it may be my last visit. I will post a photo of what I received today.",

Lots of fun wall decor, table decor, everywhere decor - evoking joy and longing for home comforts - just like the food they serve.  Nothing fancy, just yummy catfish, lots of southern \"sides\", and cooked just right.  A fun place to take guests, family, and to give your tastebuds a refresher course in southern home cooking.  Get yourself on down there!  Even we vegetarian/pescatarians can find plenty to enjoy here...",

    "text": "I went here with my family on a Friday night.  There were six adults and two kids.  We went early, about 6:30 - 7 to avoid the rush.  We parked in the garage in the same block.  The fee is validated by the restaurant.  I was very excited to try this place because my family has eaten here before and said they love it. The first thing I noticed was the floor, is was so slippy from grease that I almost fell even wearing flat shoes.  The second thing I noticed was that our waitress was just not having it that night.  She apparently didn't feel like smiling, talking, or having any patience that night.  She was so unfriendly that my uncle actually thanked her for taking the time to take our order to try to lighten her mood.  At least that made her smile. As we waited for our food I noticed two more things...the decors is pretty cool; a lot of signed and framed broadway show posters and antique bicycles, and the corn bread is amazing.  I ordered their famous salmon cakes since 1. they are famous 2. I love crab cakes 3. I love salmon. Unfortunately I did not care for them.  The flavor was really fishy and the texture was pasty.  Having cats as pets, this entree really reminded me of their canned food.  My sides were the collard green and macaroni and cheese.  This was the cheesiest and most comforting comfort macaroni I have ever had.  My husband ordered the special of the night which was pork chops stuffed with apple corn bread.  He loved it.  I sampled some of the kids' chicken tenders which were hands down the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  I even enjoyed them cold the next day.  I was not surprised that the floor was like an oil slick being that many menu items were fried.  During our dining experience the servers sang a birthday song to a customer at another table.  It was the best birthday song I've ever heard at a restaurant.  The servers were enjoying themselves singing too.  Overall my family was satisfied with their meals.  The quantity is large and the prices are low.  I took a piece of sweet potato cake home and shared it the next day with my kids.  It was still very moist and delicious.  It is so dense that it was easily shared three ways among us.  I would go back to Mert's but I do not recommend their famous salmon cakes.",

We should've just went some where else.   This is how it went...  I ordered a sweet tea and we eventually ordered the soul rolls. The sweet tea wasn't sweet AT ALL and we never ended up getting the soul roll but of course when the bill came it was on there. Yes they removed it. So our entrees came...   My boyfriend ordered the salmon creole with cabbage and a garden salad. The salad was brought out first and literally looked like they just took a small handful of salad straight out the bag and threw it on the plate. The salmon was two THIN piece and he said it didn't taste fresh at all. The \"creole\" sauce looked like tomato sauce poured over the fish and was so bland!! He wasn't satisfied at all.   So my meal was the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and cabbage. I got my tea switched to a lemonade which they say is made there. It was okay. I make better lemonade at home. But the beef ribs were okay and so were the side. It was just okay nothing special AT ALL! I didn't order a dessert.   We both left full but totally unsatisfied. The menu was very very small. It's safe to say we won't be returning.",

The waiter had trouble remembering our order (read above) to the point that he had us repeat it for the 3rd time as he entered it in the computer. The entrees came out before the appetizer. The portions are huge but nothing had any flavor. For Heaven's sake, you couldn't even taste the cheese in the mac!! There were quite a few bones in the whiting FILLET. $42 plus tip later, we left with our leftovers in tow. I tried eating it tonight for dinner but felt myself getting angrier with each bite so I trashed it. Nothing about this is food for your soul!",

Just a hint of vinegar and spice. Really good.  Okra n maters were great too. Cooked tender - crisp. Not mushy or slimy.  Beef short ribs were well done and seasoned moderately.  You can always put hot sauce on if you want more heat. Texas Pete, Cholula n an oriental offering were on the table.  The wife had fried chicken breast quarter, collards n black eyes.  The chicken was OK but not great. It was a bit over done and had a bit of an old oil taste.  The peas had a peculiar herb flavor that neither of us has tasted b4. That didn't work for us. She loved the collards.  The cornbread n butter were great.  I tried a Carolina Blonde ale that the waitress described as a cream ale.  It was more like an India pale ale. It was good.  The service was prompt, pleasant and timely. Food was served quickly.  Prices were very reasonable. Unusual for a downtown restaurant, especially in the tony hotel neighborhood.  Overall, a pleasant early dinner.",

The wait was long and don't try to make reservations because they dont take on weekends.  The waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering. ...\"imma take yall drink order and food order at the same time so who first?\" (Her exact words). I live in charlotte and have been here prior to this visit but will never return again. This was by far the worst soul food experience.",

    "text": "We chose to visit Mert's over going to a high-end chain because we wanted southern style cuisine, it was featured in travel guide from our hotel, and it got great reviews on Yelp.  I was in town earlier this month with my Mom and toddler while we visited my youngest brother who was working in nearby Kannapolis.  We were able to sit down right away and outdoors which was great.  However, we were highly disappointed by the food.  And, the experience is still memorable enough for me to write about now.  First, they were out of the fried green tomatoes which we wanted to try and we were actually there relatively early to when they opened.  The eggroll-style appetizer that was recommended instead was good but definitely within the same criteria of what we were looking for.  99% of the menu has fried food which my brother was most disappointed about since we chose the restaurant without too much input on his part.  My Mom and I decided to share the Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes.  While the size was decent, the taste was lacking and I felt it might be slightly under-cooked.  For our sides, we chose greens and the red beans both of which were just ok.  And, I will actually say the greens were my favorite food out of what I had if forced to choose.  My brother ordered the Shrimp Creole which just tasted like tomatoes and the shrimp was not popcorn style as described on the menu.  If it had tasted better I think my brother could have been happy that he found something not fried on the menu even though he had decided if he was going to make a diet exception that he was looking forward to it being popcorn shrimp.  After our waitress checked on us she said as a person from New Orleans had we asked her she would have told us that the Shrimp Creole is not on her recommendation list.  However, because other customers have enjoyed it she does not deter people form ordering it...tough position to be in I guess.  My brother also ordered the potato salad which was very heavy on the mustard and vinegar.  I'm accustomed to this style of potato salad but like I said it just had too much mustard for my liking.  My daughter had the chicken tenders from the kids menu which I found to be on the salty side but she seemed to enjoy them.  She also liked the okra and tomato and yams sides that we ordered for her.  The server was nice and she took decent care of us.  She forgot more coffee like my Mom requested but we also noticed that she seemed to have several tables.    Overall I would say I'm not likely to give it another chance just because it seemed like we were in an area with a lot of choices which might have been a lot better.  I don't know if the chef was having off day or what but I just left very disappointed and felt bad that I was the primary person pushing to try Mert's during our brief trip to Charlotte.",

They make chicken like my momma did with the skin so crispy and the meat too hot too handle.  Mine was still steaming while I was dismantling it like a lion on a zebra in the Serengeti.  The bbq rib combo is juicy and would leave me wanting more if I hadn't just murdered half a plate of green beans, red rice and corn bread.  I was sopping it up with abandon.    Heart and soul is right.  There's nothing but love on the plates at Mert's.  I can't think of anywhere else in recent history where utensils like a knife and fork suddenly became an impediment to enjoying such amazingly good food.  Put your napkin in your lap, throw your table manners to the wind and enjoy.  This is down-home cooking in a casual atmosphere and reasonably priced.  It can be very busy and I recommend trying it out your first time when it's not dinner rush or on a weekend.  But even if you do it's well worth the wait.",

We came in and it was really busy. I ordered the fried chicken breast with sides of collard greens and mac and cheese and my friend ordered the Whiting poboy. The collard greens reminds me of Vietnamese mustard and greens and was so good. That is probably the best friend chicken I've ever had. The skin was flavorful and the meat was juicy and tender. Many times friend chicken comes out really dry, but not at Mert's. Of course I completed my Southern meal with some sweet tea.",

The waitress gave me great recommendations and was very friendly.  I had the salmon cake which was so moist and flavor. Their homemade sauce added even more flavor to the already flavorful salmon cake (I just couldn't get enough of it). The vinegary collard greens had diced onion/tomato sprinkled on top. The corn bread was fluffy and sweet, and on the more moist side (although I have had better - in Boston's Oyster's House to be specific). The Okra & tomatoes was good, but I guess I'm just not a fan of the flavor of Okra, so I would have to say that was my least favorate item of my meal. The entire dinner was just over 10 bucks. Now my stomach is full and happy :)!",

The waitresses were super busy with big parties who were there for their Sunday afternoon meals but were no less charming and friendly.  I've been once before and I highly recommend the Fried Green Tomato appetizer that I had last time. The chicken is excellent as is the cornbread. I had Salmon Cakes today and they were out of this world! The mac and cheese is delicious as are the greens and green beans. I could have drank a gallon of their sweet tea but I'm glad I stuck with two. We shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake for dessert. I was good and the whipped cream on the side just melted in my mouth.  I don't know why I waited so long to make a return visit but trust me, I'm going to make it a priority to get back there soon!",

My husband opted for the special \"Tia's Chicken\" - chicken breaded with Parmesan and Italian seasoning topped with cream sauce.

    "text": "We came to Mert's after a couple hours of play at the Discovery Place science museum just a few blocks away.  The place was pretty much empty at 5:30, two tables inside and one outside.  I think it may have been a shift change because everything was just a little slow.  It took a few minutes to get us seated, took a few minutes to come get the drink order, then took a few minutes to bring us the drinks.... so from the time we walked in, we did not get to order until about 5:45.  I ordered the Soul Sampler - Buttermilk chicken tenders, soul roll (egg roll with black eye peas, chicken, cabbage), ribs, and corn bread.    The soul rolls were really good, but came with a honey mustard already on them, which I loved, but would not be good for everyone.  The corn bread was by far the best part, hot right out of the oven.  Happy faces all around for 7 people...4 adults, 3 kids.    I ordered the catfish and creole combo - the catfish was almost a whole fish, minus the head.....all the fins and bones were still there....  other than that, it was fried to perfection with a really nice batter.  The grease in the fryers must have been really fresh, as I could not taste it in any of my fried food, which is normally the only complaint I could have with fried food.  My creole was lovely 5 out of 5, lots of shrimp and the celery and onions were crisp.  Good flavor, good heat, my nose was sweating a little, but not unpleasant at all.  The BBQ sauce was vinegary and sweet, which was good, but the ribs and pulled pork really just tasted like the sauce.    The wait staff started to warm up to us at the end, so we finished of nice.    Would I come again, no... am I glad I went, yep!!  I love soul food, but sadly I have had better in Detroit Michigan.  I would rather go to Sloes BBQ on Michigan Ave.  The green beans were AWESOME, though as you would expect with soul food, cooked until mushy, though the flavor was just subtle and great.    We were also plagued by fruit flys....when ever there was food on the table, there were fruit flies doing fly bys.....I started to hum, \"Highway to the Danger zone\" but no one seemed to get the reference.",

    "text": "On Sunday September 23, 2018, I was a patron at Mert's for brunch. After church, I called to ensure that brunch was still open until 1p and it was confirmed. I arrived around 11:45a to be told that brunch was over at 12p. Keep in mind, I had called for this exact reason. Oh, let's be clear that the website read 1p, as well. Based on either time, I was there before brunch was over. The waitress was extremely passive aggressive - brushing off the fact that there was 15 minutes left for bunch and responded, \"we've already taken up the brunch menus.\" Then, trying to be condescending however telling on herself, she responded \"we stopped serving brunch at 1p over a year ago.\" Okay, Love - you just dug yourself a deeper hole. Fast forward to Monday October 22, 2018. I ordered takeout and when I walked in to pay for my order, I grabbed a menu off the waitress stand. Fast forward to Wednesday October 24, 2018. I ordered out a salmon cakes appetizer, salmon cakes meal and a meal for myself. While ordering out, I was looking at the menu that I grabbed two days before. Kiana, the manager on duty, answered the phone. I explained to Kiana that the menu had a misprint indicating that the appetizer of salmon cakes for $6.95 (for 2 salmon cakes) but under the daily fixings, there was also salmon cakes for $7.50 ( for 2 salmon cakes) and the salmon cakes meal was $10.25. I tried to get her to understand what I was saying however there was a disconnect thus, I snatched out my flexis and pulled up. Kiana was unsure of who she was speaking to, clearly, with coming at me in a condescending tone. I pointed out the exact price differences on the menu that I had grabbed on Monday however noticed that the pile of menus that were there on Monday had been removed. We had an exchange of words however, I asked for an itemized receipt. The salmon cakes appetizer was $8.55, before taxes. The salmon cakes meal was $10.95, before taxes. Here's the deal, had Kiana been more receptive to what I was saying instead of truing to be condescending before I shut that behind all the way down, it would have been no problem. Moral of the story - be factual with me. I don't come to play because I'm going to be all the way together - especially after I had washed off my makeup, snatched out my flexis and parked in front of a fire hydrant. Bye, Mert's.",

    "text": "Today is brunch day for me I stopped by this restaurant because I have been eyeing since I got in town last week. When I arrived the dinner room was full so I opted to sit on the front patio. My servers name was Leon he was anything but helpful. He did not introduce himself his first question while attending to the table next to me was what do you want to drink I was never given drink options. He then asked someone to get that drink for me. I took time to read over the menu. After waiting about 10 mins Leon finally came to take my order but was rushing. I ordered the salmon Cakes, black eye peas and, cabbage. Shortly after I ordered Leon brought me my check I had not even had my food yet or been given the option to order dessert. Finally my food came it was less then exciting my salmon cakes where mushy and seem to be undercooked. I then had to wait as Leon walked passed me and waited for eye contact before asking about my food. When I told him my concern he frowned and removed my plate from in front of me. Food was still not right. The salmon still very mushy black eye peas over down but the cabbage was vary good. When I asked if I could switch the salmon cakes for the whitening Leon got frustrated and said he would have to talk to a manager. A few moment later he came out an asked what I wanted when trying to make a decision between the catfish and the whiting he rushed me with throwing his hands up an saying which one. This by far has been the poorest service I have had since coming to Charlotte. I don't no if it has to do with the busyness of the restaurant or if this is how they conduct service. So I'm giving this a 2 star rating for the cabbage best part of what I ate",

I didn't care for the cabbage because I like mine seasoned with some kind of pork. The cornbread was good but I do not care for sweet cornbread. But this food will leave a great memory of my time in Charlotte, NC",

The cornbread mini loaf that was served as an appetizer was delicious! I ordered the catfish with sides of macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and mashed potatoes. I prefer my catfish fried on the harder side and it was served fried a little soft; it became mushy. The collard greens were vinegar based... they were not awful by any means but I have never cared for vinegar based collard greens.   There are a TON of other reviews so I won't go on and on. Due to my personal preferences of liking sweet collards versus bitter and catfish fried hard, my meal wasn't that enjoyable. I'm definitely glad that I did check it out for the experience.",

    "text": "Looking for some soul food? Head over to Mert's Heart and Soul in Uptown Charlotte. This casual restaurant definitely brings the soul to uptown with its fried green tomatoes, ribs and fried chicken. One of my favorite things is the sampler dish that they provide as an appetizer. It gives you a taste of some of their best items, including the salmon cake (like a crab cake). I'm obsessed with their fried green tomatoes and suggest getting more of the sauce on the side. Another awesome quality of Mert's is that they give you a big helping of food! I haven't been able to finish a meal, which it great for leftovers the next day. I would suggest staying away from the pork chop... it's spicy, not very tender and it doesn't come with gravy/sauce so it makes the food a little hard to swallow! But i would suggest getting the ribs or the turkey sausage Kiebasa. Also 10/10 recommend the okra and tomatoes as a side and the sweet tea is on point. Mert's has my heart!",

    "text": "I'm only in Charlotte for a month and plan on frequenting as many eateries as possible. Merts popped up on my radar after looking for a lunch spot open on a Sunday. Given that yelp only rated this place as a 3.5 stars, I was hesitant on going, but I really wanted to venture out and fill my stomach with Southern cuisine.  I purposely went early to avoid the lunchtime crowds and there was more than enough seats available. I debated between the fried chicken and shrimp dishes the night prior and settled on the shrimp Creole since there were mixed ratings on the chicken. However, when I told nut waitress that I have never tried grits before, she highly suggested that I try their shrimp and grits. And with that, my order for shrimp and grits went through. My waitress appeared within minutes with their famous cornbread. I am not really a fan of the dry, crumbly texture of cornbread on general, but this cornbread was moist and bursting of flavor. I now knew what was so great about their cornbread.  After several minutes, my order of shrimp and grits arrived. I wasnt expecting much given that grits do not have the greatest reputation--I heard they are bland, mealy, and literally gritty in texture. With a spoonful of brown gravy, shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and grits, I had a taste. This was Southern comfort food at its finest--the type that transports you to another era...back to the kitchen you grew up in. Granted, I'm not from the South but I could tell that this dish was made with soul. The buttery, creamy grits with the flavorful gravy and crunch of the onions. The shrimp were large and plump and well paired with the gravy. The focaccia bread was also great in soaking up the gravy.  For allb those looking for comfort food, try the shrimp and grits. Forget the fried chicken because you will be missing out on good ol' low country meals.",

    "text": "Ok, so overall, I give Mert's a somewhat satisfying review and this is solely based on what I ordered today as a first timer. It wasn't phenomenal, exceptional or stellar but ok.  I'm sure there are other menu options that may fall under those categories but my food was just ok. First let me say, the customer service was excellent. Every server spoke and were very friendly.  Now about the food, most of it lacked seasoning. I ordered the soul rolls as an appetizer and Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes that comes with two sides and cornbread for my entree. My sides were collards and mac n cheese but I ordered an extra side of yams.  The soul rolls didn't touch my soul; they lacked much flavor, probably because they were filled with too many ingredients (diced chicken, black eyed peas, collard greens and rice). The salmon cakes were 100% meat and not fillers, the only problem is that they fell apart when I attempted to eat them and they could've used more seasoning.  Their remoulade sauce was excellent though.  When I make salmon cakes at home, I use seasoning, (no shade) an egg and a little panko to bind them together. The \"gourmet greens,\" (which I've named them) were cute and tasted ok minus the toppings. I've never seen diced tomatoes and onions garnished on top of collard greens.  The mac n cheese was cold and had chunks of cheese curds in it. The yams were very yummy, they were baked firmly and not mushy.  For dessert, I ordered the banana pudding cake. It was very moist and delicious, not overly sweet but they put banana chips in there which I didn't like. They had an abundance of freshly made cakes which looked absolutely delicious. They had: sweet potato, lemon, coconut, chocolate banana pudding, strawberry and another one that I can't remember.  Although I was a little underwhelmed on this visit, I would return to try something else.",

    "text": "Mamma better slap me, because I just sinned...   Let me explain, I just got spoiled, I was rewarded with delicious food, and I didn't do anything to deserve it.  You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.    First let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty.   Let's break down the meal.  Fried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum.   Collard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.  Mac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal.   Here we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!  What in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.  Here's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.    Like many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends.",

    "text": "Wonderful soul food.  The collards have a unique taste, with the onion and tomatoes on top.  Mac-N-Cheese is solid, A-1 and the chicken is great.  They don't offer barbecued chicken, but you can order this barbecue sauce they put on the chicken for you (which ends up being the same) at no additional cost and it is heavenly.  My o-n-l-y complaint is that sometimes the door staff can be a bit too comfortable with you; leading to them taking their time getting you seated and on one occasion, one waitress (older lady) being very snappy with my mother and stepfather, who were visiting for the holidays.  That was very embarrassing.  I don't know if things get a little out of order, or what, but that can become very frustrating.  Other than this happening on a few occasions, this place is great!",

Although it was a rainy day when we went, we were immediately seated and greeted upon our initial walk in. I heard about Mert's through one of those food network shows I typically watch which review various markets around the United States. I called in advanced and inquired about the wait time and the receptionist kindly said come on in....there is no wait at the current moment. According to the tv show and the reviews posted the soul rolls are a must try. I will not argue that point at all. As most have noted the food is really good but it's not big mamas house but if your craving down home cooking Mert's will do.....when the bill came it was $70 bucks for 4 people with appetizers and take home desserts. In DC this woulda ran me over $100 bucks so I gladly paid this with no complaint. Thanks Mert's for not charging for lemonade refills like some souls food places feel their entitled to do...the only suggestions and reason I could not give this place 5 stars is it did not have a changing table for my mini me which made for a rather interesting duper change lol...peep the pic, I will come again, hopefully my kids in pull-ups by then lol",

    "text": "My Co worker and I went to the Mert Soul Food today. We go different places Uptown Charlotte for lunch. I was like here we go again. So we come in , place an order to go no one said have a seat while you wait nothing. Mind you we placed an order for 2 jumbo wing plates. There was not a smile between 4 grown ass, you would think professional server/ waitresses or what ever they are considered to be. I would have sworn they were races against there own race but, one was Caucasian. So, upon receiving our order I asked for hot sauce. The female who brought us our order where we were seated outside, rudely told me it's in the bag. So we checked our bags there were 2 packets of hot sauce for each 3 piece (JUMBO) wing meal. I stepped inside and said in a joking manner now you  know I need some more hot sauce smiling the entire time. Her: No, I didn't know but, I'll get you some more. With the nastiest disposition possible. That thing bothered me like an experience I just had at Taste of Charlotte. So, I called for I guess an hour or more. Finally someone answered the phone. I asked for the manager. Bet you can't guess who the manager was. LMAO. I inquired about how dry and nasty and cold and unfriendly there establishment was. Because, this wasn't the first time. Not to mention not one smile from entering to leaving. This damn girl said, \"I gave you standard what we issue for an order. I said, \"you're missing the point, your staff didn't smile or say a friendly word.\" She said, I smiled when I said have a nice day.\" So I guess that was shade. I told her that I would make sure to leave them a review so here's the sun light to your shade. A large party of law enforcement came in and they were all lit. So, I guess maybe dine in customers that are potential tippers get smiles and local employees get the sour face. So, I will keep posting. Customers, potential customers, dine in, dine out, whatever the case may be,  deserve hospitality and service with a smile. Word of mouth is your best advertisement. Ratcheted...ness has no place in Public Relations. Customers matter and keeps your business growing and going.",

The Mac and cheese was good but on the dry side but I liked that it had pieces of the browned crusty top.  The string beans were inedible and looked and tasted just like canned beans, though afterward, the waitress said they were not canned. She asked why I had not asked for something else since I did not eat them, and I said I wasn't sure I would be able to eat anything else as the cornbread had been so filling.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things but would not rush back there.",

Whenever we would ask for something it was almost like a mother may I situation. We didn't know if her reaction would be positive or negative. The manager seemed to not care about our situation and just left everything up to the waitress. After paying my bill I waited for my change that never came. I ended up asking for the manager to find out where the waitress went with my money. After the manager asked the waitress the waitress states she already gave me my change  after reminding her that she didn't give me anything she states oh then I have your money right here! It was in her pocket. Not sure how she could have forgotten that she owed me more than $10!! Especially since the tip was already included in the bill!

    "text": "I dropped in early on a Saturday morning for their brunch, and Mert's indeed definitely has heart and soul. Everyone was really busy and happy, even at 9AM. The service is great, the food is fairly priced, and the \"advertisement\" appeal does not entirely overwhelm the experience.  The brunch fare did not sound particularly appetizing, since eggs are not my favorite dish. I went with a vegetable plate of home fries, yams, collards, and mac and cheese. Best decision possible. $7? Crazy.  With your meal, they bring out their famous cornbread. It is super moist and crumbly on the inside, and it is served piping hot. There is a touch of crunchy crust on the outside; awesome.  The macaroni and cheese has some awesome gooey crust mixed in throughout the large scoop. The collards have onions and tomatoes for a fresh taste. The home fries are a bit different than hash browns: soft and heavily seasoned. The yams have a bit too much sauce; they were a bit too sticky, though nice and creamy.  I also tried a sweet potato pancake. It was slightly bland, but I liked the fluffy texture and little bits of crispness along the ring.  Mert's is quite the institution in Charlotte, so I am sure that it is split between locals and tourists. No matter how touristy it gets, I am certain that it is going to stay for a long time. The service, food, and price make it a great dining experience. It is different, but just as enjoyable as eating your soul food in a Southern diner with grease on the walls.",

After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing, I decided to go with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday with lunch at Mert's.  After the most interesting discussion (!) with manager (?) I discovered that I did not have the necessary \"proof\" to rate the birthday \"deal\" in spite of having a valid NC driver license clearly showing my date of birth.  In today's economy, I was stunned that any food establishment would take such a tack with a good paying customer!  No worries on seeing my dollars at Mert's ever again.  To many restaurants want my patronage. -cheers",

    "text": "On a short layover in Charlotte, we wanted to have a taste of the town since we'd never been here before.  My better half was really craving fried chicken, and we wanted something well-rated, non-chain, and definitely local.  Enter Mert's.  It's located among the Queen City's tallest downtown skyscrapers, which really impressed the kids as we walked a couple blocks from affordable parking.  Yup, you read right - no on-site parking, short of what's available on the street, when it's allowed.  The place is jam-stuffed with character by way of miscellaneous framed pictures, signs, old Americana, and even hanging bicycles.  The wall even has an interesting blended/faded paint job on it - really nice!  We were promptly ushered to a table, provided menus and drinks, and kindly assisted with a tour of the menu and food options after we introduced ourselves as Charlotte and Mert's first-timers.  I ordered a fried chicken leg quarter with sides of collard greens and yams.  My bride went with salmon cakes, and sides of mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.  Kid #1 had chicken fingers, and #2 had grilled cheese.  Before dinner arrived, we were served two plates with two large servings of cornbread each.  The bread was steaming hot, and hit the bullseye on very straight-forward cornbread.  Tasty!  Dinner arrived and, as we always do, wifey and I partook family-style, trading bites of everything between us.  Overall, everything was good at worst, and a couple items were amazing!  Unfortunately, in our opinion, the fried chicken fell into the former category.  Don't get me wrong - it was tasty, the meat was moist, the skin crispy.  It's just that it seemed to lack seasoning - even basic salt and/or pepper.  And, admittedly, my expectation for chicken joints is that the chicken be outstanding and a bit different.  Not just well-executed plain fried chicken.    However, the salmon cakes and all the sides were fantastic.  This was only the second time I've had collard greens, and Mert's were the better of the two I've had.  Not only that, but I'd say it was the best thing I tasted on this occasion!  Also really, really good were the yams and the salmon cakes.  Service was better than average, and very friendly.  Also, all four of us left stuffed like turkeys on the big day, and for a very reasonable cost.  Great value.  Charlotte did right by us for our first taste of her riches!  We hope to return again soon!  Food = 4/5  Facility = 3/5 Service = 4/5 Ambiance = 4/5 Value = 4/5",

I got their all the employees just hanging around acting unprofessional. I wasn't greeted, wasn't asked if I needed anything else or thanked for giving them my business. The cabbage was bland not seasoned at all and the mac and cheese is definitely made with Aldi store brand cheese, I made the mistake of making baked macaroni with it,  it's horrible.

    "text": "The family and I went here over the weekend after a long day at the Strawberry Festival. I had been wanting to eat here for years, especially after seeing them on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I'm such a foodie so I love trying new places.  Hate that we had to pay to park, but that's the downside to eating somewhere in the city. It was a beautiful night and we got to eat out front. Food was GREAT. Service, not so much. We were seated before another table, and they were greeted and brought drinks out to. I had to get up after about 10 minutes of sitting there and ask if we had a server. The hostess said our server was busy so she'd take our drink order. Right after that, he came over to our table and got our order.  First, they bring out the cornbread. Omg! Best freakin cornbread I've ever had in my life!! It was so moist and just absolutely delicious. I ordered fried chicken, bbq beef ribs, mac n cheese, and green beans. The fried chicken was a little disappointing as I anticipated it to have more flavor than it did. It was kind of bland. The ribs were decent, a little too fatty but that is to be expected. Mac n cheese was off the chain. Green beans were just that, nothing special. My son had green beans, mac n cheese, and homefries. He didn't care for the homefries cause they were more like sauteed potatoes and he prefers fries. My husband had the shrimp po'boy and homefries. He said his was good.  Our drinks stayed empty for the most part so service needs to be better. We left an 18% tip (he's lucky he got that), and the server picked the receipt up before we left and had an ugly look on his face like we didn't leave enough. Sorry, next time you should pay more attention to your tables. They weren't that busy. There were plenty of empty tables.   All in all, it was a nice family dinner in the city. Wasn't even too expensive (about the price you'd pay at Chili's). Not sure we'll be back, but it was a good experience.",

(party of 4)  Let's start with the Pro's:  Appretizer: Fried Tomatoe ***, Salmon Cakes***,Cornbread***** stole the show ---the Best!  Fried Chicken Wings***, not winget were nicely seasoned. Fried Whiting ****,  Collard Greens - Alright **  Con's, Sides need much improvement: Steam Cabbage tasted like it was cooked in dirty butter water  negative Star* awful (Sorry) Green Beans - taste sweet, did you put suger in them (no-no)- negative Star Seasoned Yellow Rice was just Yellow ----LOL Blackeyed Pea - just blackeyed peas, nothing special Side salad, was so small it belonged on top of slider Blackend Salmon was over cooked, super dry!  Plus I think, the food was cooked with MSG, because I got a food headache...theres a differance.   My waiter was very pleasent!  The place was nice and clean and I enjoyed the atmospher. But you must pay to park. :(  @GuyFerrari, I'm sending you my Diner Bill!",

The corn bread they bring out is huge and amazingly tasty! I was a big fan of the grits. They had the perfect flavor and consistency.

We had fried green tomatoes, beef ribs, Mac and cheese, fried catfish, and yams. We also had the coconut cake which was really good but they order their cakes from a bakery so I can't give them credit for that. The worse disappointment wasn't their food, it was the \"greeter\". As soon as you try to walk in, like you would any establishment, she was there to quickly push us out saying we had to wait outside for our table. Ok that's fine but instead of pushing customers out of the restaurant, the professional thing to do would be to stand outside and nicely greet customers before they walk up to the door.  All the people standing outside - the common conversation was looking at each other saying \"what's her problem?\". The only reason I stayed was because I had family with me and we're fans of Guy Fieri who visited the place and said they good food on his show. Unfortunately I disagree with him about their food.  Once we got inside and was seated, our waitress was extremely pleasant which did make up for the rudeness we experienced earlier.",

The food was great and the service was exceptional, UNTIL half way through my meal, I looked next to my seat and there was a gate that housed alcohol, that wasn't the problem.. The problem was the gate was filthy! It was covered in dust bunnies and black gunk! I told the manager (I'm guessing she was the manager on duty, she couldn't have possibly been the real manager) about how unpleasant and unappetizing it was sitting next to it, so something could be done for the next guests who are seated there. But, Her attitude was TERRIBLE! I simply asked for a to go box and my bill because I immediately lost my appetite. I don't know what was nastier, the disgusting, dusty, gross gate or the \"managers\" nonchalant, barbaric, discourteous attitude.   I wish I could have gotten a picture!

The po-boy was a huge piece of bread with literally 5 shrimp on it for almost 12 bucks, and came about 7 minutes after everyone else's food (supposedly they were \"adding more shrimp\" LMAO!) Their cornbread is legit though, I will give them that.  Sadly good cornbread isn't enough to make up for their lack of caring, it shows in their food and service.

Maybe just a difference between Texas and Carolina cooking.   The jumbo chicken wings were delicious. The fried green tomatoes made me want to watch Fried Green Tomatoes.   Worth the price? Not sure...I've just had better soul food.",

I've just never had an opportunity to eat here until I had some friends staying in Uptown and they wanted a \"Charlotte meal\". So here's to Mert's and one less bookmark!  Classic Southern soul food. Collard greens and fried okra and fried chicken and sausage gravy and all those yummy things that just put weight on when you mention their names! I was tempted by so much but when the waiter mentioned their specials, I knew that the grilled pork chop in white gravy was for me. And it was. Excellent and tasty with lots of flavor and spice, I cleaned the plate and then picked up the bone for chewing. Great stuff. For sides, I had the mac & cheese (excellent!) and the yams (only meh).  For dessert, the peach cobbler was only okay - an overwheming spiciness. I think that I might have just gotten a bad scoop, because my friend who had it really liked his. The vanilla ice cream gave it the right consistency, but the flavor wasn't right.  Street parking only, but it's barely a stone's throw from the LYNX Station so consider taking the train!",

I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.    DETAILS: We were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right, and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides, and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments, we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.  Anyway, so unlike my previous visits, I left very disappointed and unfortunately, left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place.",

Charlotte is not getting locals into downtown on the weekends because you have to pay to park everywhere!  I called the restaurant before going and asked where to park.  The person told me we could park for free in the Holiday Inn parking garage.  Not so!  We had to pay $8 just to park for lunch!  All said, we spent $60 for soul food!  Rice and bean, shrimp creole, one kids plate of 2 chicken fingers, and one kids vegetable plate.  Also, kids meals did not include a drink, and they charge $2.00 for a child's drink.  It was hot in the restaurant, loud from the voices of other diners, and you couldn't hear the music.  This place is not worth the price.

The cornbread was like something your grandmother made and a very large portion with a side of sweet butter. I got the fried chicken with greens and beans. The chicken was crispy and to die for. The greens were just succulent. Now, the food was great but the dining experience was ruined due to terrible service. The minute we walked in and were greeted by a server with an attitude I knew this might be dreadful. Our drink orders were about 10 minutes getting to the table and we were never offered a refill. Our server just stood at the end of the table waiting to take out order but didn't speak. After we gave her our order she couldn't remember it and Asked for it again. She never made eye contact with us and was rushed even though they were not busy.   The customer service can make or break a dining experience and I can tell you we would have just left it the food wasn't so great. However, we will not be back. I hope you are able to recognize the need for a attitude change for your servers.",

As well as a bunch of sides (mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, catfish, cornbread). The country ham was wayyy too salty but mix it up with the grits and you're back in business. Things that were excellent: the cornbread, the biscuit, and the mashed potatoes. The catfish was ok, it didn't really taste like anything but frying oil.   The service was pretty weak. Our waitress forgot to put our side order of catfish in...I know it sounds absurd.. who orders a side of catfish? Anyway, she forgot it and brought us a full catfish meal at the end of our meal which we didn't turn away 'cause it just wasn't worth the trouble. And to top it off she added an extra omelet to our bill. I usually don't check each line item on my bill but I could tell the waitress was a bit of a basket case and was right.

When we were seated the waitress was sweat at first. She explained to us that the catfish wasn't her favorite but the chicken was ok.

I told the young guy that my order was incorrect. He huffed and took my plate away. The person I was with, asked the server for gravy. We asked someone in the restaurant to bring us gravy because our server was no where to be found. As we asked him for the gravy, he asked us to move our purses so that he could use one of the inside chairs.......Are you serious. 20 minutes later, the server came back and said, \"Oh, he never brought it?\" After that she never came back to check on us, until it was time for us to pay.

Then Mert's is the place for you!  I would aim to come here for breakfast or brunch, but be forewarned, the wait can be quite long.  Also, don't eat Mert's before a day of outdoor activities or extensive traveling, the heavy nature of the food makes it most conducive to a sedentary timeframe (or overall lifestyle).  When we were there, they were out of a myriad of items (OJ, country ham, other breakfast staples), but they more than made up for it with smiles and service.  However, my Yelp rating schematics do not currently allow for smiles to compensate the country ham shaped hole in my life, thus minus one star.  Still check them out though, maybe even practice a few y'alls while your there!",

I had such awesome memories of it and the food was to die for. Ive been insisting for one of our coworkers to go and I finally had the chance to take her and 4 other friends. Red beans and rice tasted soooo simple, as if they were seasoned with only salt, pepper and garlic. The seasoned rice was hard :( and the ultra big hormone filled chicken wings were super plain!! Worst of all, our server gave us the worst service. Never once quality checked us. She saw a lot of our plates barely touched and didn't even think twice to ask us if anything was wrong. I was furious! I didn't leave a tip and I am a former server! I would never do that. For southern home cooking, this was an insult. Im sorry. I work to hard for my money and time and make no excuses when Im not satisfied. The worst experience on my first outing in my city. :(",

The decor made me feel at home, the waitress was friendly and had the perfect southern drawl, the food smelled wonderful, and the sweet tea...oh the sweet tea was good! Plus it's located in Uptown Charlotte which made it all the better.   It was lunch time when we went. I ordered the pulled pork as my main dish with yams and collard greens as my sides. The cornbread was really delicious and i really liked the butter which had a sweet taste to it. The food took a little while to come out but I wasn't really in a hurry to leave. I was excited when it did come out though. The pork had the most wonderful flavor ever. It was drenched in the yummy sauce that they use which was sweet yet spicy. Perfect. The yams were just right and the collard greens were delicious. A California native, I have never had collard greens before but I know for damn sure these were good!   The freshly made cakes looked awesome but I was just too full to order a piece.   The price was right and the food was great. I think I might need to plan another trip to Charlotte soon so I can eat at Merts again!",

My biggest problem was the service.  We got the same waitress both times (lucky us).  She was surly and very uninterested in doing her job.  Both times it took a VERY long time for her to even come to the table.  I would understand if she was busy, but there was no \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"Sorry for the wait\" or anything.  Just \"Are you ready to order?\" without even a smile.    Our server also forgot to bring a salad we had ordered.  When the main dishes were dropped off, she dropped it quickly and didn't offer to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else.  We had to ask another server for the salad.  We only got a refill on our drinks when she dropped off the check, since she definitely didn't come to check on us during the meal at all.  Honestly some of the worst service I've ever received ANYWHERE.  My husband and I are pretty patient people, but this was ridiculous.  Since it happened twice with her, I have to assume she's normally like that.  Anyway, the food was fine.  Those saying it's the best cornbread ever really need to try more cornbread, especially something homemade.  It was okay.  Fried chicken, chicken tenders, and salmon cakes were also okay.  Nothing to write home about, so I doubt I'll be giving Mert's a third chance.  With \"just decent\" food and lousy service, it's not worth it.",

It's the kind of lick your lips food that makes you forget it's going to be a long day on the treadmill tomorrow. The fried chicken is also fantastic, as is the shrimp po'boy.  The owners here are so friendly, and you often see various members of the family working the registers or serving tables. They talk to all the patrons like they're newly inducted members of the family, and make it a very fun, comfortable atmosphere to eat some great food in. We've also used them for catering several times and they stole the from some of Charlotte's biggest names.",

We were recommended this place by a local coworker of mine since I was in Charlotte on business.  Apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food.  BF and I started off with the salmon cakes appetizer ($7.60) which were delicious!  The \"remoulade\" sauce that it comes with is perfect with the salmon.  I ordered the southern fried chicken leg with collard green and mac n cheese ($8.79).  BF ordered the fried catfish with collard greens and mac n cheese($15).  And all meals come with a piece of their infamous corn bread -- which was easily the best cornbread that I'd ever had.  Everything was great until I got into the center of my chicken, where it was uncooked at the bone.  Our waitress came to check on us and saw my chicken and started to apologize profusely.  She took my entire plate and said she would get me a new chicken leg.  On the way to the kitchen, she showed another waitress the leg and they both started shaking their heads.  She eventually came back with a fully cooked chicken leg at no extra charge which was cool, but I was almost full since I had eaten almost half of my previous chicken before I got to the raw part.  The rest of the food was great and the prices were definitely favorable, but it was unfortunate that I ended up with the uncooked chicken.  Not sure if I'd come back next time I am in Charlotte on business.",

I ordered the Soul Rolls, some friend green tomatoes, a cup of chicken soup and also a bowl of chicken soup for two of my co workers.  The first thing they both said was that the soup was salty, but given the menu I was already expecting the salt to be heavy so their comment didn't surprise me.  Even after a lengthy delivery process my Soul Rolls were indeed tasty; maybe contained too much black eyed pea and not enough chicken?  But certainly not a deal breaker.  The fried green tomatoes were tasty too and I finished them quickly.    They seemed to specialize in low country fish and sea food dishes, none of which I'm a big fan of but if you like that sort of cuisine, then Mert's is the place for you  :-)",

    "text": "This was my second visit, the first time I really enjoyed the meal and service. However this last visit will probably be my last. The waitress seem to dislike her job, no smiles she wasn't friendly at all. It was like I was asking for a favor when I asked for a refill on my drink. I came in with my family, and they actually enjoyed their food(fried chicken wings and sides). I wasn't so lucky, I ordered fried pork chop with a side of macaroni and cheese and seasoned rice. The pork chops were very salty and oily, the grease was pouring out each time I cut the meat. I was also give burnt Mac and cheese, I don't mind having my cheese a little burnt but not my pasta. I think Merts is one of those hit or miss type restaurants. It's unfortunate because I love soul food but I would rather cook before I spend money on burnt food with snotty service. What I did enjoy was the cake. Whom ever made the lemon cake hands were touched by God.",

    "text": "I visited this place during NASCAR weekend. I should have listened to the locals from Charlotte that kept telling us to try another place for soul food. But it was close to the Mariott and we already made plans with another couple to meet there.   Well, the locals were right and my wife's intuition based on bad reviews prevailed.  The waiter began by flirting with my sister in front of her daughter- - we smiled but not appreciated!  The food was substandard at best. I ordered beef ribs that were more fat than meat. And the vegetables just didn't have a clean taste to them.    To add insult to injury they imposed a 20% gratuity for a table of 6!  Trust me this was not a good time and the pizza we ate that night hours after at Zablong was the better choice.  Save your money!",

    "text": "Sunday morning the cornbread hits the spot.  The rest of the meal, food and service, was mediocre at best. To tell the truth, the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to \"go away\" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.  We started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find \"tomatoes\" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.  We waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table.   After finally chasing someone down inside we got our check. With all the options in the neighborhood to try we probably won't add this to our list of great places to dine.",

The food they served at the food festival and what they truly serve at the restaurant is completely different. It was misleading and money was wasted. I've never regretted eating at a restaurant to this extent. Their macaroni and cheese tasted like powder. Their mashed potatoes were wack. Everything was wack. the water was even wack.  This restaurant is like going to your moms friends house that doesn't cook well.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying i hate to leave such a low review of a black owned and ran establishment but .. i must be honest, so here we go.   My boyfriend and I arrived around 4:35 pm and were sat around 4:49 pm. We stood in the door way of the restaurant while the host buzzed past us a few times but we finally got her attention and were sat at a table outside. This didn't bother me, i really wanted to love this place so i didn't mind. The inside of the restaurant boomed with the smell of well seasoned food and it was HOT inside. Like grandmas house on Sunday when the stove has been on for hours. (which i loved lol )  We sat and waited for our order to be taken which took 45 minutes. My boyfriend wanted to leave at this point, but like i said i really wanted to give this place a try. I pushed him to stay and finally, not our waitress ( who hadn't come to introduce her self or take our drink order... Yes 45 minutes with no drinks) but the woman who was bringing out drinks  finally took our drink order and quickly returned with them and them. Then, she came back and said \"shes really behind so I'm going to help by taking your orders\". She took down our orders and the food came to our table in about 20 minutes ...  Despite all the waiting i was ready to dig into the food and finally get my hands on that CORNBREAD ! My boyfriend had the salmon cakes yams, and mac &cheese. I had the fried chicken breast, home fries, and mac & cheese. The cornbread that came with the meals was GREAT. My fried chicken was VERY overdone and nearly burnt, the crust had a hint of flavor but thats about it. The Mac& Cheese was good but very VERY DENSE and heavy like it was made with a lot of cream cheese or milk Which took away from the flavor. The home fries were SPICY... i'm not a fan of spicy foods. My boyfriend's salmon cakes according to him, were just \"alright\". His Yams were flavored perfectly with the sweetness and made me wish i ordered them as a side.   We waited about 30 mins for someone to come to the table, i wanted to order 2 slices of cake to take with us but no luck. By now, i didn't want to give this place any more money & my boyfriend went inside to pay because no one ever came back to our table.",

Cooked well, crust was good, flavor good. The remoulade sauce is spicy, but that's where all the flavor is! I tried my sis' yams. Those were good!  The cornbread was OK despite all the rave. My sis said it taste like jiffy. I agree that there wasn't anything special about them. Like Emeril says, \"kick it up a notch.\" That hmph was missing about them. Dessert - banana pudding was very good but could have used more wafers. Red velvet cake was tasty - perfect moisture and flavor.  Service - the servers were good and gave great recommendations. They keep pitchers of drinks near the patio door which is a lil odd.  Overall great spot I would visit again.",

The fella had the same but added the combo sides of eggs, grits and bacon. We went back and forth over whether to do home fries or grits so our very excellent server, Latosha, brought both. Bacon came out crispy (as requested) and the home fries were a cross between french fries and a breakfast food.  Service is friendly and attentive without being obtrusive. Price is a bit steep but well worth it. I am trying to figure out how I can make this a weekly event!",

It doesn't lack that casual southern character that makes you feel at home, especially with all the waitstaff in t shirts and jeans.  My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, decided on our orders and were pleasantly surprised when the food arrived in just 2-3 minutes. With nearly all of the food made ahead of time cafeteria style with just a quick sear needed to finish off some items and no finishing touches for most others, you might worry that the quality suffers but it did not in our experience! I ordered the salmon cakes with collards and mac & cheese and she got the chopped bbq with green beans and mac & cheese. The salmon cakes were amazing.. no other way to describe it, just order them! The remoulade on the side makes them even better too. The chopped bbq was very good as well. For the sides, the collards and green beans were both tasty choices but the mac & cheese stole the show. So gooey and cheesy, classic baked macaroni & cheese like mom/grandma used to make. The cornbread was good but nothing special. I would have guessed that the salmon patties or mac were what Mert's was famous for rather than the cornbread tbh.  Overall, the food was fairly inexpensive and came out very quickly, but the taste was amazing and the portions were very large. Add on the fact that the waiters were friendly and that's about all I ask for in a restaurant experience!",

Neither of us had been here before but we will DEFINITELY return.    The cornbread is fantastic and deserves the rave reviews it gets on here.  The crab cakes are delicious and a steal at under $10.  My date's chicken tenders were really something and the homemade blue cheese dressing was some of the best I've  had in a long time. The collards have a great flavor and are meatless which is a plus for vegetarians.  The yams are a MUST have as a side.  This is one of the most satisfying meals I've had in Charlotte and add it to a very reasonable bill...under $25 for both which is unheard of in Uptown, you just can't go wrong!",

    "text": "I was in town for business, and this \"landmark\" restaurant was about a block from my hotel. Seeing as a large portion of Charlotte's Uptown restaurants are closed on Sunday, I decided to go against my initial judgment and give this tourist trap a try.  Unfortunately, my instinct was right. The whole meal was off. I ordered the chicken tender plate with green beans and mashed potatoes. The green beans were too sweet, and the mashed potatoes were so under seasoned that they tasted like a pile of mush. I was happy when I saw the chicken tenders once they're hand breaded in house -- that was until I was on my last chicken tender, and it was a piece of fried fish.... This carelessness by the kitchen staff is unacceptable.  The saving grace was the dessert. They have a great cake display, and the cakes are absolutely delicious. The cakes are the only items that reminded me of good ole Southern cooking.",

This \"so called \"soul food\" doesn't come close to the taste that one should expect when thinking about soul food. The Mac and cheese was subpar and the chicken was not seasoned and was served lukewarm, not hot. Even more disturbing was the price for the meal. The Waitress was friendly and attentive, however, she served me wine in a glass that was not properly washed and had a lipstick stain on the rim.  (I wore no lipstick at all during my visit.)The tablecloth was also old, worn and torn. There does not appear to be a lot of care put into the food or the establishment anymore. Only those who are not familiar with the real rich, authentic taste of soul food will find this place pleasurable.",

I was confused on which person was going to be my server. One person sat my daughter and I and the other popped up out of no where. My daughter and I ordered the soul food roll appetizer it was okay nothing to brag about. I was wondering where the flavor of the food was. I ordered a 3 veggie platter potato salad, collard greens, and blackeye peas. In addition I ordered fried okra and yams. The only thing was good was the fried okra and cornbread. Sad I seen no manager the server name started with a B he was a male. He could have informed his manager that neither I or my daughter barely ate any of our food. I am not one to complain. My daughter ordered the shrimp salad and she did not eat it she stated that the shrimp were not seasoned. The greens had a white film to them the beans had no flavor the yams taste like they came out of a can the potato salad was too mustard based for me because I am not a mustard fan. By far this was the most unappetizing soul food place I have ever eaten at in my whole entire life. I still paid the bill 40$ wasted on food that went into the bus tub. I will let everyone know that this restaurant is not all that great. I will never come back.",

Our table shared a plate of salmon cakes as an appetizer.  They were tasty, crisp yet moist, strong salmon flavor but nicely seasoned.  The remoulade served alongside was incredible.    I ordered the BBQ pulled pork, with mac'n'cheese and home fries as my sides.  The pork was amazing -- quite sweet, with just the right amount of spice.  The mac'n'cheese is DIVINE, creamy and cheesy and carbohydrate love in every bite.  The home fries were alright, but not as outstanding as the pork or mac.  And of course, the cornbread was wonderful, but sweeter than I expected.  The staff and ambience were friendly and welcoming, even for a huge group on a busy evening.  They moved tables around to seat us right away.  I will definitely return to Mert's if I'm in the area again.",

    "text": "After our edifying visit to the Bechtler, we needed some practical, real sustenance. From the man's memories of the dark days of living and working in Charlotte, he unearthed this gem, and what a bright one it was!  I was a little skeptical of his years-old memory of this as great soul food, especially given his vegetarian status at the time. (I mean, hello lard!) But I've learned to trust, and was well-rewarded on this visit. Mert's is a bit tucked away, and doesn't look like much from the sidewalk or even as you step inside.   But, for soul food, that's a good thing. A good thing that just kept getting better.  Now, I spent some time living in the South as well, and that's where I developed a taste for two of the simplest and best culinary pleasures: greens and beans. And Mert's served up some of the absolute best collards I've ever had: thick and silky, folded on themselves in a heaping mound on the plate, so slightly redolent of a little bacon and sprinkled with lithe ribbony onions. Oh. My. God. I hope I live long enough to learn how to make collards like these....  In other news, the cornbread was phenomenal: dense without being heavy, moist without being crumbly, and actually tasting of cornmeal and buttermilk instead of sugar. My black-eyed peas were savory and straightforward, and the barbecue (while not my absolute favorite Eastern Carolina style) was dripping in a just-sweet red vinegar sauce. Oh, and the red velvet cake was excellent: moist with a ever-so-tangy icing. Did you think I was going to pass that up, once I saw it in its tall cake platter on the counter?!  This is why the term \"foodie\" fails as a designator for people such as myself who avidly seek out the best, most authentic food experiences one can find. There's nothing elite about Mert's, but they prove how difficult it can be to pull off simple perfection.",

The service was fast and friendly, the sweet tea was syrupy sweet and the interior is very entertaining. My sister enjoyed a dessert - was it sweet potato cake?  Something that seemed a bit odd to me. As far as uptown southern goes, I'd say Mert's is your spot for casual, friendly, quick but still very tasty - a nice place to hang out with friends.  King's is better for dressy and classy.",

I went on a Friday night after work and it was crammed full.  I took that as a good sign because that many people here has to say something right?? We were quickly seated, the food came out fast and I don't really have any complaints about that.I ordered the Salmon Cakes with mashed potatoes and green beans. I thought this would be a glowing review based on what I'd heard, and how crazy busy the place was.  The salmon cakes were pretty good, potatoes were so so, and I don't even remember if the green beans were good... I'm just sort of disappointed based on what I thought it would be like. The service was ok, nothing extraordinary and I felt the same about the food I ordered. Shortly after walking out, my stomach was so upset, and stayed that way for a couple of days. The best thing about this place was the corn bread, and the sweet butter. Perhaps next time I'll listen to the other reviews and go for the chicken?",

We were seated and received excellent service from our server.  Unfortunately, the brunch/breakfast options seemed very limited and their taste was just average.  We crossed Mert's off our list as a feasible brunch option II wouldn't recommend it for this time of day) but may return to give their lunch or dinner a try.  I do love a good fried catfish!",

We were sat at the first outdoor table and the gentleman left after seating us. We looked over the menu and had all decided on what we wanted. We waited 32 minutes and still not a single person employed by Mert's bothered to ask us about a drink let alone any type of service.  I was beyond put off by this and thought it to be very unprofessional!  They were Not that busy at all. There were plenty of waiters and waitresses standing around talking and even the gentleman that sat us was just sitting down gabbing with another employee.  We will NEVER go back again. As a small family owned business like Mert's you strive for customer satisfaction,  I know this all too well. As a small business owner myself I continuously look to support other small businesses but obviously my standards are far exceeding that of Mert's standards. Such a shame.",

    "text": "Mert's was the first restaurant I ever visited on my first ever trip to Charlotte a couple of years ago. As far as I'm concerned, it's the only one I would truly ever need! I come from a family of Southerners who are absolute connoisseurs of cornbread. My parents agree that Mert's fresh, hot cornbread slathered with a pat of butter is the best they've ever tasted. (Sorry to my great-grandpa who owned a Southern diner outside Knoxville, TN, whose cornbread recipe has been passed down the generations of my family ever since - it's a close second.) Their Soul Rolls are divine, but with the cornbread and generous portions, an appetizer isn't really needed. I have had the fried chicken (excellent), the beef short ribs (delicious), and the fried catfish (fantastic), but the meal that in my mind has been handed down straight from heaven is the salmon cakes. Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes are served with their homemade remoulade sauce and give you a glimpse into heaven that you will want to savor slowly. My go-to side items are the collard greens, topped with tomato and onion, and the mac and cheese. I went to Mert's after the most recent half-marathon I completed, devoured my delicious meal and polished it off with a giant slice of their sweet potato cake. It sounded too interesting to pass up. And, when else could I have justified all those delicious calories? I have only had one \"hit or miss\" visit to Mert's, where the cornbread was a bit toastier than I prefer, but everything was still fantastic. Most of the time, you are in for one of THE best meals you can get in Charlotte.",

We got fried chicken, greens, grits, eggs, hoppin johns, and whatever else was in the buffet. We were allowed to take our desserts to go and we got banana pudding, banana pudding cake, and chocolate cake. All of which was very good. We went back a few weeks later when my mother came to visit and she enjoyed it as well. It's definitely a place to try when in the mood for soul food while downtown.",

We ordered their famous salmon cakes, their ribs platter, with mac and cheese sides, homefries, collard greens, and their okra and tomato stew.  The mac and cheese and collard greens were average (at least in my opinion since I didn't grow up eating soul food I probably can't say too much about the taste of these two items), but the stars of the meal were the cornbread (this was by far the best cornbread I have ever tasted in my life....getting sweeter with every bite), the ribs (in this tangy sweet bbq sauce that you just want to dip everything into it), and the salmon cakes (these tasted confusing at first but gradually the unmistakable salmon flavor seeps through - truly umami in your mouth).  The salmon cakes really surprised me. I expected fried fish patties, at the very least dripping with oil or grease, but instead got these lovely, grilled tasty salmon cakes that were absolutely amazing but weren't heavy at all (the fattening feeling you get after eating fried foods).   Bottom line, go for anything with sides and cornbread to try as much of their menu as possible. And believe this place is the real thing (big quantities and good quality...and affordable!)- the inside makes you feel like you're in the old South and they've got dim lighting that makes this place glow warmly from the inside. Also, it helps that Hillary Clinton chose to eat at this place for lunch two days ago on her visit to Charlotte. There ya go.",

Not too salty, good balance of flavor, spice and acid. Nice beautiful leaves which proved it was made with fresh greens! It's a diamond in the rough.  The black eyed peas and cornbread were very good too.  I think the whipped butter made the cornbread sing.  The fresh peach cobble was yummy and that's the way to end a good ole fashion soul food meal.  The ambiance was down home local with some fantastic soul and R&B playing in the background. If you're about the food, then this is a great place to patronize.",

    "text": "I was in town and my mom wanted to come here due to the great things she has heard about this place! I double checked on my trusty Yelp app (as usual) and the reviews here were favorable.  We arrived during lunch hour on a weekday, and it was a nice day so we decided to sit outside. The place is not that big, but the restaurant is full of character inside.  I ordered Chicken Wings as an appetizer... ummm that was definitely a given! For my main course, I ordered Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes with Mac and Cheese and Green Beans as the fixins. My mom had Fried Catfish, along with Collard Greens and some other fixin I can't remember.   So let me dish on my dishes. The Chicken Wings were delivered nice and hot, crispy but lacking in flavor. The Salmon Cakes had a decent presentation, did not have a strong fishy taste, but they were super salty, I couldn't finish more than a few bites. The macaroni and cheese... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni. I think they gave me the top layer. The green beans were delicious. They were well seasoned and flavorful. I left  And service was lacking as well... the server was friendly, but service was slow and it was not that busy... my water stayed empty and we waited a little too long for the check. It was like we were outside and forgotten *sad face*, so I had to ask another waitress to find our server to bring us the check.  So overall, I was super disappointed with our lunch at Mert's. We were underwhelmed and the food was overpriced. I'm from Charlotte so I know of many other places to find great soul food, so I probably won't return.  Note: If you do decide to try this place on your own, check Groupon or Living Social as I saw them listed on one of these services so you can get a good deal on your meal.",

The chicken tenders are everything you want them to be (on a salad they're almost healthy*). The slaw is chopped until it's almost pureed, and it's freshness cuts through all that grease. And believe me, I'm happy as a pig in shit** sitting outside listening to the Beverly Hills Cop theme song, shaking Texas Pete onto a quarter chicken with a Carolina Blonde to cool me down.  But I would give all that up if it didn't include the cornbread.   These tall, warm, individual mini-loaves are the fluffiest, moistest pieces of cornbread I've ever encountered, and with the slab of whipped, sweet butter melting slowly into the golden sides...I would come back just for this cornbread and nothing else.   But if I HAVE to order the fried chicken to get it, I'll bite that bullet.  _____________  *Not True. **Never said that before, but it seems appropriate here.",

Everything looked good on the menu and after a couple of minutes we ordered. Our party of three all ordered the same thing, fried chicken, mac and cheese and collared greens. No lie, our food was out to us in less than 5 minutes! We dug in and it was Ahh-mazing!!! The fried chicken was flavorful and crispy but not greasy! The mac and cheese was superb and the collards were on another level! All of this for around 12 bucks made it all the more better! I will definitely be back at Merts every time I am in Charlotte!",

I like to try foods I don't normally make myself, so I avoid the usual staples like collards, beans, and mac & cheese. I tried the beef ribs, yams, and black eyed peas. I should have ordered the staples. The yams were the best part, just sweet enough. The peas were oddly sweet also...yuck. Salty, yes. Hammy, word. Sweet, gross. The beef ribs were a joke the serving was one and a half pieces and six bones. Of course I rolled my eyes and muttered to myself but since I was with company I kept quiet. As with most soul food places,  I think this place caters to folks that don't have a momma that can throw down.",

Maybe we went on an off night or something but there wasn't anything left ( no fish, no salmon cakes, no Mac & cheese, no mashed potatoes, etc.) and the chick failed to mention that until we were actually trying to order our food. They only had  chicken, pork chops, ribs and greens left for the most part. The chicken looked like it was good, I ordered the pork chop and that thing was cooked beyond repair. I felt like I was chewing meat flavored rubberbands. My fiance had ribs that were mostly fat and gristle. The greens were under seasoned and undercooked (and why were they garnished with raw tomatoes??). I mean, we went in there with such high hopes and were so disappointed. I'm gonna just assume that we came on an off night and I may give it another try cause I wanna try those salmon cakes everyone raves about, but I'm skeptical.   On another note, the cornbread was DELICIOUS. We were pretty  living off of that until it was time to go...",

The Mac and cheese was dry and obviously reheated more than once :(  Our server was pleasant,  but she annoyed the crap out of  me when not once but twice decided to inform us that \"in the south  they throw pepper over the shoulder into a dish.\"  The food has a lot pepper in it bc the cook decided to add a lot of pepper--the end!

    "text": "After seeing Mert's featured on the Food Network, I was super excited about visiting this place while visiting Charlotte. I arrived on a Saturday during lunch hour and was seated within 10 minutes. Our server was not friendly nor attentive the entire time but she did have a few parties in addition to my table of 2. It took about 20 minutes before we even got our drinks. By the time she was ready to take our order, we decided to put our entire order in all at the same time so our entrees came well before our appetizers. Once we were ready to go, it took about 15 minutes for our check to be delivered. I know the place was busy but they really need to improve on their customer service.   Now for the take on food. Let me preference that I'm from the South and grew up eating and cooking Soul/Southern food my entire life so I may be a little bias.  Appetizers We ordered the Soul Rolls which were amazing. Black eyed peas, collard greens, chicken and rice egg roll style. They are unique and very tasty.  They also give you complementary cornbread which is pretty good. I think they must use sour cream with the mix because it had a more tangy flavor.    Entrees My boyfriend ordered Shrimp and Grits. He enjoyed the dish but definitely has had better. The Roux was very bland and the grits were a little overcooked.  I ordered the Fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens. My catfish was good but both my sides lacked flavor. The macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter.  My collard greens was way too salty. I've had better greens from a can of Glory.  Overall - I think a must try is the Soul Rolls for sure. All the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor. And you must be willing to overlook the horrible service as well.",

I ordered 1 quarter leg of chicken with a side of macaroni and cheese, and mashed potatoes. The order came with cornbread. The inside of the restaurant is very spunky, and it feels like a nice casual spot for a bite! I'd definitely do dine-in too. In fact, if I eat there again (which I would) I'd prefer to dine-in since southern comfort food is just better hot and fresh. The chicken was great! Not too flakey/crunchy. More soft fried (which I prefer). The quarter leg is huge and 1 was sufficient for me. Mac and cheese was good, but nothing outstanding, and the mashed potatoes I loved, but they were a bit too salty. I'm a salt fanatic though so it worked for me but I could see others being disappointed. I'd probably try other sides the next time I go. The cornbread was amazing!!!!! It was still piping warm when I got back to my desk with it. By far the best cornbread I've had. This place knows its southern comfort food. I'd recommend this to others!",

I had beef ribs, Mac & cheese, and collard greens. The BBQ sauce on the beef ribs was rather unique, not to my liking. The collard greens were disgusting. They are vinegar based. They aren't chopped up so I essentially had a bowl of vinegar based collard leaves. The fried chicken while plain was the best part of my meal with a little Texas Pete added.   I ordered the salmon patties as an appetizer. They were highly recommended. They were heavily peppered and was another dish not tailored to my liking.   It took about 30+ minutes to receive our food. Unfortunately, this will be my first and last time visiting this establishment.   (My sister would like me to note that this was a visit at night, allegedly there food is better before dusk)",

We were immediately seated. The table had a large 6 pack sauce holder on the table. Moved it off it took up too much space. Waitress was nice but she wasn't aware of the specials. My friend and I got the catfish with chicken combo. It seemed like a lot of food so we decided to share. It was a decent portion to share if your not famished. The cat fish was salty, the cabbage was bland, the chicken was burnt, and the Mac and cheese was decent. Got a side of red beans which was maybe from the bottom of the pot. They charge extra for corn bread. The price wasn't stated when we placed the order we were asked if we wanted 2 pieces. The corn bread was good. The place had items on the counter that were irrelevant and collecting dust.  So this is soul food in the south....",

I am willing to give them a second chance, The next time I go, I may try something different.",

Mert's came up in my search in the Diner's, Drive In' s, and Dives on Food Network. We decided to give it a try. The food was delicious. I got the fried whiting with  green beans and macaroni with the cornbread and lemonade. Perfectly seasoned green beans and whiting. Just like my own macaroni and cheese. Hubby got collard greens, black eye peas and smothered pork chops. Seasoned well also. I would recommend this restaurant. I will be returning. Great service. Quick service, great customer service and great portion size.",

The second time we came because of the delicious food, caring service, and AMAZING cake!  Our must haves (I ordered it again the second time) were the soul rolls, the fall-off-the-bone fried chicken, and the coconut cake! Seriously, we tried lots of the their wonderful options: lemon, German chocolate, banana, yellow with chocolate...but the coconut takes the cake. All were super moist and just the right sweetness!  Both times we were taken care of by the sweetest waitresses and surprised by how great the prices were. If I'm ever down in NC again, I'll definitely return to Mert's!",

When the waiter arrives he tells us that they no longer sell those items anymore (wtf! why bother having them up then). So we continued to order and 3 out the five things we asked for were out including the Yuengling (who runs out of Yuegling!) Collards were the best thing we ordered.

The service was amazing friendly and warm like I was coming to their house. We came at 9pm on a Thursday, it closes at 930pm. But the waiter made sure we knew we didn't have to rush because there was over an hour of cleaning etc to do  Now let's talk about the food. About the amazingness of it.  My girlfriend and I got two different things and shared. I'll list in order our favorites.  1. Collard Greens- they were the best I've ever had. They were just done perfect. 2. Fried Catfish- it was cooked and breaded perfectly.  3. Fried chicken- followed closely by the fried chicken, breaded light but perfectly. Those 3 were my favorite after that the others were good but not as mind blowing.  Solid mac n cheese, yams, okra and cornbread with whipped butter...mmmm.. My girlfriend got the salmon cakes they were the only thing that was a disappointment.  Not bad but they were whatever, we killed everything on the plates except the salmon cakes.   They had a microbrew Carolina Blonde that was a solid beer.   Overall from the service to the food it was a great experience. I'd recommend it for sure.",

I went with the buttermilk and herb chicken fingers which sounded incredible. They were about $11 and came with two sides. Overall they felt flat and had an overwhelming garlic taste that became too much after one or two (and I love garlic -fyi)  I don't think I could eat them again. The Mac n Cheese as my side was a saving grace. Wow-awesome! Cheesy-stringy deliciousness and I ate it right up. My other side was the mashed potatoes which tasted great at first bite but again became overwhelming fast. Perhaps if I went with a veggie side I would have felt better but the food was so rich I felt queasy by the end. My boyfriend ate my cornbread as I don't care for that myself, and he liked it quite a bit.   I had a bite of my boyfriends steak and eggs which were way overcooked and the steak was literally coated with grease - definitely not my type of thing. He said it was pretty average if a bit overcooked for him as well.   I thought for the food quality it was a bit overpriced (but pretty standard for the area) and overall I just felt like everything was too salty, greasy, and rich for my own taste buds. Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is True, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath.  If I went again I would order something MUCH lighter...lesson learned.   On a positive note the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation pieces. So for me Mert's is just ok.",

The yams weren't even close to those that my Mom makes, but hey..maybe I'm biased. Part of the downfall of Mert's for me is due to the fact that I have had Lawan's and they are on a completely different level. Mert's seems almost a bit commercial to me and it seems that maybe the food isn't prepared fresh (although I did have to wait a long time).   I'm willing to give them another try, but I don't really want to pay for it so it's likely not going to happen. I love soul food and the people there were super friendly so I wish them continued success, however I'll be heading to Lawan's for my soul food fixes for now.",

The decor was fun and made it feel southern. This is the first time I have had Southern food, so I may not be as discriminating as some with more experience.   With that being said, I ordered lemonade and water to drink. My waitress brought delicious cornbread before my meal. For food I ordered the BBQ chicken, yams and collard greens. Their greens come with a tomato and onions but since I told the waitress I had never had them before she said they are good by themselves and maybe I should try them that way.  The food didn't take long to arrive and the portions were decent. Not huge, but since I'm not a big eater, it was perfect. The flavor was good for all the items.   The food was reasonably priced and food. I would recommend it and go here again.",

In the simplest terms: The food is very good, but it does a get a little busy on the weekends, and it isn't cheap.  I've ate at Mert's three times, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. Their salmon patties are great alone, but put their remoulade sauce on it and it's perfect, seriously! Their catfish is nicely breaded and flaky, and their sides are equally wonderful too. I've tried most of them and they're all spectacular. Their soul sampler appetizer includes a soul roll, chicken tenders, and bbq ribs. Delicious, but a whopping $12. Don't expect to eat at Mert's for less than $25 for two people!",

The lady at the door didn't greet us, she just stared into our souls and then told us and the couple behind to follow her. The restaurant was very small, cluttered and hot. Our waitress was nice, but I feel like she was putting on a fake voice and smile. My husband ordered the fried wings meal with macaroni and collard greens meanwhile I chose the catfish dinner with macaroni and collards. While waiting on our food, I noticed one of the waitress' picked up items for a salad with her bare hands, placed it on a plate, and took it to the customer seated on the patio. I was disgusted. Finally our food came after about 20 minutes of waiting! Yes! Our meats & macaroni were delicious, but the collard greens were terrible! Clearly, they didn't take the time cut up the greens before cooking them, so we had big leaves on our plate. After we finished our food we realized that our waitress had disappeared, which was no big deal. Moments later we heard different waitresses fussing amongst one another about her absence, and the amount of people coming in to be seated. The older lady with the long fake eyelashes kept shaking her head saying \"we can't seat them!\" Overall, the restaurant was ok, and I will not be returning. Please don't waste your time.",

I probably should have known better and gone with a different protein. Collards were a bit under seasoned. Mac was standard. The real star of the meal was the cornbread.   I will go back and try a few other things. Restaurant has cool atmosphere and service was on point. Plus, the location is really convenient to the square and the transit center.

My date ordered fish and grits (the fish was okay) but since the water Merts uses tastes bitter, so did the grits. I hope they get a filter for their water as it is disgusting.   When I mentioned it to the waitress, she added that she's heard the complaint before. LOL It's really difficult to mess up a breakfast and I am so sorry to say Mert's did.

Seriously, about 3 minutes after we ordered. Piping hot, full of flavor and delivered by an over-the-top waiter with a smile.  Refills came quickly and our time in Charlotte will always be remembered thanks to Mert's. The hostess was a tad rude, which started everything off a little odd, but everything rebounded from that.

We found the perfect restaurant on Yelp and quickly chose Mert's Heart & Soul. I love comfort food so this was my heaven. I had blackened pork chops with collards and mac&cheese. The mac&cheese was so delicious that I almost ordered a second round. My husband had the ribs and fried chicken combo with collards and mashed potatoes. I tasted his and it was yummy too. The cornbread loaves were scrumptious with the sweet butter. So not to be left hungry later when we returned to our hotel, we ordered the soul rolls & smoked turkey with beans & rice plus dessert- coconut cake, banana cake & caramel cake. All of the cakes were moist and full of flavor.  Our waitress, Malika was great! She was funny, attentive and pointed us in the right direction with her recommendations. She made our dinner a complete success. We will definitely be visiting again and asking for Malika when we return.",

The collards have a smoky taste without the unnecessary addition of meat. The cornbread with the honey butter was perfect. And, the mac n cheese is cheesy without a lot of grease.

    "text": "We LOVE Merts! What a great place to dine regularly & bring out of town guests. We've lived in Charlotte almost a year. Merts was the first place we dined in Charlotte & we continue to go back often & have taken almost all of our out of town guests. We just took my parents (from the Midwest) & they loved it, too. Great soul food and good service. Merts is always busy, but the food comes out quickly & is always tasty. The veg plates offer vegetarians or folks who just want to try a lot of sides a great dining option. Our guests have enjoyed the catfish, shrimp, ribs, fried chicken, & BBQ. And, the cornbread is to die for. Best cornbread I've ever had. We like that it always comes out hot & fresh & that you get real butter (instead of the packets most places serve today) to lather on your individual loaf. I can't say enough great things about Merts. Great place!",

The organic yellow grits are out of this world good.  I didn't care for their biscuits, but everything else was mouth-watering good!!!   The coconut layer cake is light, fluffy bites of heaven on a fork!!!",

The smell of fried everything wafted from the kitchen. Sign posters on the walls showed pretty much every stage actor ever had stopped in. And the staff was friendly as could be.  As for the food, there was absolutely nothing that feel short of expectations. Fried tomatoes, mmm mmm mmm! Green beans cooked in delicious country ham juices. Fried Chicken, salivating good!  Our waitress kept emphasizing desserts. We went ahead and got some strawberry shortcake, a sweet explosion of flavor later, we exited satisfied, with smiles on our faces, and about 5 pounds heavier.",

The macaroni and cheese was watered down looking like velvetta cheese, collard greens were bland, sweet tea wasn't sweet, fried chicken was soggy. Mom was hungry so she peeled the skin off and ate the meat. She also had to pick through a ton of stalks in the collard greens. I asked them if they had a new chef they said no but new prep people I'm like well y'all need to teach them something cause today's dinner was horrible. So it seems Merts is either hit or miss depending on who's cooking or not!",

    "text": "I came to Charlotte for a work related conference and decided to come to to Merts for lunch on a Sunday based off of a recommendation from a coworker that had visited a while back.  Maybe it was because this joint was so hyped by my coworker, but Merts kind of disappointed me.  I took a stroll from my hotel and arrived at Merts and the first thing I see is a line out the door.  I think to myself \"This place has got to be good if people are willing to wait outside on a cold and cloudy day like this.\"  I step into Merts and the first thing I notice is the dim lighting.  While it the environment looked comfy, it was just so jam packed that immediately I thought about leaving and coming back at a later time.  In the end I just decided to get takeout.  Since the place was so busy, it took me a long time, maybe 10 minutes? to place an order.  Then I waited another 20 minutes for them to get me my food.  Maybe it's just the Sunday Lunch rush, but the place is way understaffed and way too small to cater to so many patrons.   Now onto the food.  After receiving my food I walked back to my hotel to enjoy some BBQ.  I want to start off by saying that the cornbread that came with my food was probably the highlight of the meal.  It was just that good.  I also got mac and cheese, BBQ ribs, and green beans.  The mac cheese were definitely disappointing, not very gooey with cheese and was just overall something I could have made better at home.  The ribs while tasty, were over sauced and a bit tough.  The green beans were just green beans and I didnt have too high of an expectation for them, but they were so mushy and watery that I couldn't believe that Merts would serve it and charge money for them.  Overall, the experience was kind of negative, but I haven't given up on Merts.  A lot of people seem to have had a good experience here and I will definitely give it another shot the next time I'm here.",

Great Southern food, good service, very reasonable prices (considering the location of the restaurant)....I really can't think of anything negative to say about Mert's.  My husband and I have visited here twice now on our two most recent visits to Charlotte. Both times I ordered the salmon cakes, which as others have mentioned, are very tasty and with the remoulade are even better. The portions are large and it is hard to finish a plate. I also love the mac and cheese (very cheesy) and the collards. My husband is a big fan of the fried chicken, saying it was some of the best he has had at a restaurant.  I also love the cornbread that they bring out before the meal. The bread is sweet and the pieces are also large. Our service here has been very attentive and friendly.

I was raised on southern cooking and am aware of variations in seasoning and techniques for one location to another. However, although good, the food does not satisfy my appetite when I'm in the mood for \"soul food\" or southern cooking. I'm sure this varies from one person to the next.

I ordered the sampler that came with soul rolls, chicken wings, and a salmon cake. The wings were pretty good but everything else was not good, lacked seasoning and flavor. How can you call this soul food? I also ordered the blackened salmon with a side of okra and tomatoes, mac and cheese and an extra side of collards. Blackened salmon was horrible. Salmon cake was undercooked and I gave it back to waitress. She didn't even offer to get another one but in her defense, it was super busy and she was one of two waitresses. I have never had collards so awful. No flavor once again. We all ordered them and had to add salt, pepper and vinegar. The mac was pretty good. The okra and tomatoes lacked flavor as well. I will never go back and I am sure the only reason this place gets business is the location. Anybody who has ever had real soul food will know that there is way better soul food in Charlotte. Oh and the waitress apologized for the  blackened salmon that I had to send back. She said she would comp drinks but didn't. She did remove the salmon from my tab and charged me for a veggie plate. The cornbread was the best thing this place had to offer. My family all agreed that the food was just bland. Next.",

To be honest southern food isn't really my jam so perhaps I'm not the best judge of it but I could still appreciate it. The menu is what you'd expect - fried chicken, okra, cornbread and the like. Friendly service and you won't find a cheaper meal in Uptown.",

I decided to try this completely letdown I thought I was about to have some amazing corn muffins at least at the very least minimal what I had was a really nice waiter totally wasted time, aggravation and money. This is only for the extreme tourist who has never seen soul food in their life. The Mac and cheese was not good. Soul roll scary. Beef rib half ok to good. Chicken hard, way over cooked. The salmon cake I don't even know, worth a try. I had to ask the waiter was that really catfish or some other fish. Fresh Waters is a lot better.",

    "text": "Delicious home cooked southern food at Mert's Heart and Soul, Uptown Charlotte.   Came in on a Saturday afternoon and found the restaurant extremely busy. We were told it would be \"awhile\" but actually only ended up waiting about 20 minutes. The tables and people are packed in tightly and it can get pretty hot at times due to the proximity of the kitchen; however, the wonderful smells that seep out from that same kitchen make up for it.  We ordered the salmon cakes first as an appetizer, which came highly recommended from our friendly server. Everybody at the table raved about them as they were devoured fairly quickly. The Blackened Pork Chops, BBQ Beef Rib and Chicken Combo and Carolina Chopped BBQ all graced our table as did a multitude of sides including the delicious Mac n Cheese and Okra stew. Pork chops were thinner and dryer than I was hoping for and the gravy on the mashed potatoes was a tad too salty, but other than those minor complaints everybody left highly stuffed and satisfied. Oh, and leave a space for some peach cobbler! Great southern food in what seems like a fairly famous staple in the Charlotte area.",

The system I think had some limitations that didn't allow for the level of customization I wanted but when you his submit, I never got a confirmation or anything. I had to call and verify that they received my order. Luckily, they did.   The person that answered the phones seemed a bit impatient with the questions I had and that I was varifying receipt of my order. When my husband arrived to pick up the food, he was met with even more disinterest from the staff.   We got the food back and it smelled and looked great. We couldn't wait to tear in. Sadly to say, everything was extremely bland. The chicken seemed to have no salt on it nor any other seasoning. The Yams were burnt in taste and low in flavor... almost like they used a sugar substitute. The mac n cheese was fair but the best thing we had tasted. The corn bread was just ok but it wasn't nearly hot and they gave us frozen butter which, if you're staying in a hotel obviously is an issue.   We would not necessarily recommend this place unless maybe you need a low sodium low flavor diet but even still, it isn't a healthy food option. There are definitely some better places but.. try it at your own risk. Maybe they had a different chef that day or he/she was having an off day.   If someone else was paying, I would be open to giving it a second chance.",

They were everything I hoped they'd be. My main protein wasn't what I had hoped for.   I ordered the catfish with candied yams and green beans. I also had a sweet tea as well. I personally like my catfish more on the crunchy side and this was the exact opposite. Had a decent flavor but myself and my dinner date both agreed we have had better.   The location is cute it's kinda in the downtown area of the city and the drive in was a nice scenic route. I did enjoy that. I wouldn't have mind parking far and strolling on down to the restaurant vs driving. We snagged a good parking spot luckily because street parking is limited. If you like sides like me you'll love theirs. Give them a try if you are in town. My had no real complaints about his food and he is a big foodie too.",

    "text": "Did you ever feel like you've been catfished by a restaurant? Not in the good way, where you eat some delicious catfish, but where the online photos and experience are NOTHING like what you encounter in person? This restaurant embodies that experience so perfectly I'm surprised they aren't claiming they're a model or a rapper that just needs to borrow a few hundred dollars.   Ambience: Casual, with a regular serving of insects. I can understand the flies since there was an oddly placed lamp beside us, but I also had to kill a silverfish on the menu, a tiny roach at the end of dinner and some random bug that crawled on my cleavage at the end of dinner. If I had seen the roach earlier in the night I could have avoided this catastrophe.  Drinks: Insultingly subpar. If your mimosas have as much alcohol as a glass of Kool aid then you need to start over. You can buy better champagne from a 7-11 if they sell it in your state.  Food: Dreadful. We got the soul food sampler so we could try everything, in addition to the shrimp Creole and a side of mac and cheese. The salmon cakes were okay, that's the nicest thing I can say about them. The wings had zero seasoning- the best thing I can say about them is they weren't raw. The soul roll was an abomination of grease and tastelessness, and should be removed from the menu immediately. The mac and cheese tasted more sad than a kindergartner's Kraft cheese and macaroni. There were no curds or any indication that any skill was involved here. I assume this was the cook's first time in the kitchen- it was a 1 cheese crime against soul food. It earned a solid F. The shrimp Creole there's no excuse for. OPEN A BOX OF ZATARAIN'S IF YOU CARE THIS LITTLE.  Staff: Lovely! The only bright spot in an otherwise demoralizing evening out. She was a sweetheart and deserved every penny of the tip she got. I'm serious, she was great!   Overall: Just go to McDonald's and get their breakfast menu items. As a person who easily skips McDs for years at a time this is saying a lot. But if you're yearning for terrible food you should at least save money while you're at it.  RUN!",

The tenders and honey mustard were pretty good. The cornbread is drrrryyyyyyyyyy my goodness. They need a honey drizzle ASAP. The Mac and cheese was slightly above average but needed some more cheese. I ordered the chocolate cake for dessert. Also dry. Waste of calories and $5.

I've licked my fingers to their beef ribs, generously garnished in their house BBQ sauce. I also love their cornbread, not quite up to Mom's, but a far sight better that many one might fine in a similar restaurant, and It has always been hot when served to me, always a plus. Mert's does their wings up right, large and in charge, providing big chicken eating to a big appetite.  Always worthy of a return visit. I also love their old school atmosphere, as they keep your attention, scanning the walls for something new that you might have missed on a previous visit. I have found the staff friendly and most attentive to your wants, especially when the hot sauce runs out...",

    "text": "This review I would say would be a pretty weak 4 star.  First time here. I was in town for a conference and me and my friends just did Crossfit so I asked the concierge at my hotel to direct me to a place where I can get my grub on...   He asks like chicken and stuff? I said like Mac and cheese and ribs and all that Good stuff lol and this is where it brought me.  It's a small southern comfort food style place. My expectations ran high as I saw Guy Fieri \"was here\". Plus who could go wrong with comfort food right?  The restaurant hours didn't close till about half an hour after we walked in.  And one of the waiters didn't want to sit us in his area because he didn't want to serve any more tables on his side. Well thanks Pal. The restaurant really isn't that big.  Anywhooooo...  We ordered and our waitress was kind of snappy. I guess she was overwhelmed and tired that day that she wanted to close the restaurant already.   I wanted to order the ribs with Mac and cheese and string bean. But the waitress informed us there wasn't anymore. Okay... How about the corn on the cob? We're out of that too.   As I grew frustrated and hungry, I just opted out totally off the second side dish. Out of everything , I was looking forward to the Mac and cheese more than anything.  Our cornbread came right away, served nice and warm. delicious! But our entrees took a while.  Then a miracle happened! The kitchen staff was so kind enough to make a batch of fresh Mac and cheese. Praise the Lord!  And purely because of that reason, I gave them one extra star for that really kind gesture.  Our food came and it really was a mouthful. My ribs was DROWNED in sauce and oil. Tasted good like any other ribs to me. Mac and cheese was great. String bean was really soggy . I don't know if it should look like that on purpose.  Price is around $8 and up and they do have combos.  Personally, I didn't think this place was that special. Just a good Comfort food place that's all.  Recommend for a grub.",

I was highly disappointed considering people speak highly of them. The food was rushed. The catfish taste like grease. The yams were not soft and not thoroughly cooked. The shrimp creole sauce was dried up over the rice. The best thing about the meal was the cornbread. My friend had salmon cakes and they were overly cooked and were burnt on top. I do not recommend Mert's",

The food was ok.  It wasn't the most amazing seasoning, but everything was cooked correctly.  The corn muffins were huge and came out hot, but didn't have that gritty corn texture that I hate about corn muffins.  I don't know what they do to those tasty treats, but it beats bringing out a bread basked any day.  The downside was that they did not have any of the \"specials\" listed on the chalk board above the kitchen.  Mert's...you can't put broccoli & cheese up there and expect me to be like \"oh yeah, I didn't want that anyway even though it's been staring me in the face for the last 15 minutes.\"  The server was really nice. I'm also not sure if the Manager was also helping out, but he was certainly on the floor taking care of business.  The decor seemed like a bit of a mish mosh.  It wasn't a dirty place, but it definitely seemed a bit outdated and pieced together.  I don't know if I'll be back, but if I have a friend in uptown looking for some comfort food, I'll send them over to Mert's.",

Our waitress kept checking in the kitchen to see why our order was taking so long. Food was thrown on the plate. Too much breading on the catfish.Presentation terrible. Rushed once they realized our order was not taken care of. My friend ordered green beans; side dish had remnants of other vegetables in it. Luckily he wasn't allergic to any of the extra items that showed up in his food. Have visited Merts several times and this was the worst experience.  If there is longer than anticipated wait time in food being prepared then simply informing us of the issue would have been sufficient. This did not occur.",

The fried chicken was just okay.  I have had a lot of fried chicken I would recommend over theirs.  The cabbage and yam sides were good as well.

Definitely best soul food in Charlotte.  White, black, asian, or whoever, soul food knows no boundaries; everybody should be able to appreciate fried, fatty, buttery, greasy goodness.",

    "text": "I miss Mert's. Well, I guess I miss good southern food in general, and, to me, Mert's is why. Granted, I love my Bojangles, Cookout, various BBQ joints, calabash and all. But, whenever I head back to Charlotte, I make it a point to hit up Mert's at least once, if not three times.   I usually get the fried catfish with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The catfish is fried to perfection, nice and crisp without being overly oily or heavy, and the cooks make sure to leave the fins and tail on for those customers that really know how to eat fish. The mashed are made from real potatoes, and the collards are very flavorful, kissed with just the right amount of vinegar. And of course, I always gotta have a loaf or two of the absolute best cornbread in the world. There's a reason why the above is listed as my last meal on earth, and given the portions, I may just be able to delay that inevitable end by a good half hour. The portions are HUGE!  There's nothing on the menu I wouldn't try. There are some definite \"safe\" items, especially for breakfast. But, if you're just starting your southern cooking career, the fried chicken is excellent as are the shrimp and grits, which aren't really my cup of tea, although that sweet tea now... Service is good, warm and friendly just like service usually is everywhere in the South. There might be a wait at lunch, but given the good weather in Charlotte, you can usually grab a seat on the sidewalk pretty quick.   I'm sure there are better, more authentic spots for southern food. But, for visitors to Charlotte, or those looking for something a little more chic, and sitll new to Southern cooking outside of KFC, a stop at Mert's is absolutely mandatory.",

We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again.",

Thank you to management, Veronica in particular, for making a bad experience and almost the last experience one worth trying again. Salmon patties were very dry and not seasoned as described, potato salad or should we say mayonnaise salad was horrible. The yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated. The greens were soaked in garlic and had entirely too many stalks. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but in conjunction with everything else on our plates was room temperature. Tiger wood drinks were very tasty. Our server was not at all attentive to our needs. If she would have given us her name I would have very well called her out in this review. She did refill our drinks once and left the remaining glasses of lemonade and sweet tea on the table which implied.....self serve. My fiance absolutely loved the cornbread loaves and fried whiting. I detested the cornbread loaves. The initial one that I received had obviously been sitting out too long. It was cold. When I mentioned it to the waitress she informed me that she knew the loaves were left out and that a new batch would be up any minute. She did bring a fresh loaf but I was just flabbergasted that she would serve something she new shouldn't have been served. Overall, the experience was not very pleasing. However, our entire meal was comped by Veronica. She apologized for the service and invited us to come back. I must admit I am a little reluctant but because she heard our concerns we will give Mert's another try. I see their are multiple good reviews on here and hated to have to be the one to add a negative review. However, this was our experience.",

    "text": "Traveling on business I was feeling antsy in the hotel room and decided to get out and explore downtown Charlotte last night. I read on a Chowhound article that Mert's was a good place for a solo diner to get some good local food without feeling weird for eating alone, plus it was Southern Soul Food. The experience started off on a high note with quick, friendly service producing a Carolina Blonde Beer (not local, btw, from Wilkes-Barre, PA) and the pinnacle of the experience: cornbread. The rest of the meal (my shrimp and grits) didn't live up to the hype and so I have to give this place an overall mediocre review.  Pros -Cornbread- this stuff is the truth. But I felt it set the bar high as my first  taste of Mert's capabilities. Thus while satisfying enormously with its crumbly sweet goodness and soft buttery mouth feel, it paradoxically set the table for disappointment. -Good Service and Atmosphere - again I was a solo diner and it didn't feel awkward at all. The place is casual, upbeat and friendly. Good for dropping in alone and unannounced.  Cons -Salad - the 'garden salad' is billed on the menu as a $2 add-on to your entree. I make a point of regular ruffage while traveling, so I took the bait. What I got was literally a bread plate with about an inch-deep layer of iceberg lettuce, a single slice of cucumber and a plastic cup of ranch dressing. I ordered honey mustard. This was about as 'gardeny' as a plastic-wrapped airplane salad and way too much money for what I got. I usually won't mind paying upwards of $10 for a properly vegetated salad, but for $2 this was wickedly overpriced considering an entire head of this lettuce costs about $1 retail.  -Shrimp and Grits - just ok, bordering on the meh. I wanted to like this so badly, to have the Soul Food experience I've been dreaming of. Sadly, this wasn't it. Too much grits, small shrimp lacking freshness and watery sauce throughout.",

If it the customer service was as bad as the food then I would've given 1 star. . .For drinks, we ordered Arnold palmers . . . Watered alll the way down. Appetizer we ordered the soul rolls. They were good but nothing to rave about. On to dinner: my date ordered the special of the day which was pork chops w/ a side of cabbage and yams. The pork chops were dry and heavily dusted with an unflavored spicy seasoning. The cabbage was bland and didn't taste like anything at all. The yams were extremely dark and had a layer of butter/oil on top which made it inedible. My date tried a bite of everything and couldn't finish her meal or beverage. My meal was the chicken tenders with a side of red beans AND a side of rice( btw they should just make red beans and rice one COMPLETE side, but since I'm not looking forward to returning. . . I digress ) the rice was yellow AND unflavored. The beans were unseasoned in a watery liquid. While trying to get the waitress' attention to let her know we were unsatisfied, a homeless man was trying to ask us for money on the street. The mgr quickly got rid of him when she saw him approach. She handled it very well. We then told the mgr about our issues and we paid for the soul rolls only because we are all of it.",

    "text": "Coming to Mert's is very hit or miss. Since moving to NC, I've been a handful of times, but the taste and service just aren't consistent.   The service:  I'm always greeted by a friendly hostess and immediately seated. Usually, I have very nice and attentive servers, except the last two times, especially the last time I had gone. The waitress just acted like she didn't want to be there and like we were intruding on her job, which ironically, is to serve customers.  The ambiance: I like it. It's like a colorful hodge-podge of historical knick-knacks. The only thing I don't like is the stickiness of the tables.  The price: This place is VERY affordable. For example, a chicken wing meal with two sides is about $10. A huge slice of cake is like $4. Nothing is outrageously priced.  The food: It was very good the first time I had gone. The second time, it was still pretty good. However, the last two times were an utter fail. During my last visit, I had to return my food because a hair was in it. I declined another meal because my appetite was lost because my food was disgusting and I found a hair.  I've tried a couple of things on the menu. The fried chicken wings were pretty good the first time, but after that, they lacked seasoning, so i had to use hot sauce, which i usually don't do. The macaroni & cheese is good. I hated the candied yams; they clearly come from a can and are really soft, mushy, & overcooked. The greens aren't the best but aren't the worst. To me, they have a bit much of a vinegary taste to them. The cornbread is good. Their Sweet Potato Cake is delicious! I love it!  But, sometimes it's sold out, so that saddens me when it happens, lol! I've tried the beef ribs, and I really don't like them, but they're not flat out nasty. I would much rather eat ribs from a smokehouse or another BBQ place. My last time I decided to try the fried shrimp po'boy with a side of home fries. It was DISGUSTING. The shrimp were very, very tiny, even for popcorn shrimp, and EXTREMELY greasy. The fried batter was soggy and falling off of the shrimp.The home fries were cold and lacked seasoning. I sent that plate back.   So, I hope you catch them on a good day!",

I worry that some of these reviewers want to be treated like they're the only people in the restaurant (or the only ones that matter). I went in with an open heart and mind and was not disappointed at all.  The cornbread that everyone raves about? Totally deserving. The best I've had at any restaurant, ever. The fried chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside -- again, tops. The green beans I had were not the best ever, but they were very good. The mac and cheese was extremely tasty, and I think I'd have a tough time getting my kids to leave the restaurant once they tried it!  My server was gracious and sassy, just as I like 'em. When I ordered a dessert ('nana puddin') after the meal, she told me it was really good and I'd better save her a little taste. But I couldn't do it. The food was so good, I wished I had two mouths and two stomachs. She pretended to be mad at me for eating all the pudding, but I think she was happier with the generous tip.  I will come back to this place any time I'm in Charlotte!",

The worst of the worst Mac nasty taste like Chinese buffet Mac, green were big and not washed lacked flavor, ribs were chewy and had no sauce this place just overall disappointed.

I actually had to add my own brown sugar and cinnamon to get the taste to my liking. The mac and cheese was ok but the cornbread was the best thing I got in my meal",

I wouldn't bring a party of 10 because it's not that large on the inside, or if you do I would call ahead to find out if they're busy at the time or not. It's kind of earthy on the inside as far as the walls and floors. The menu is definitely southern inspired. It's a mixture of \"the south\" & creole. I had the blackened salmon with rice and greens beans. I absolutely loved everything! My friends had the macaroni and cheese and it was the next best thing to your mother's. The Cornbread is buttermilk made...not hot water! The bread will fill you early so eat it last if you can. The only con is the tip is included in your bill. Our waitress wasn't as attentive as she should have been. She would get your request and walk away before you could finish with something else. I guess since the tip is included she didn't care, but she still had a great attitude. Maybe she was overwhelmed. Nevertheless you will enjoy your food!",

A quick search on Yelp turned up Mert's. Southern soul food sounded fantastic!  I didn't leave disappointed. We were able to quickly get a table during lunch hour. I thought the service was exceptional, even though one of my items were wrong, but it was handled well.  My favorite part had to be getting a huge piece of corn bread while waiting for the meal. The fried chicken leg quarter I had was definitely top notch. The fried catfish fillet needed more seasoning, but the Cajun tartar sauce made up for that. My sides of mashed potatoes and mac/cheese were alright.  I'd definitely say a 4/5 meal, 5/5 service, and 4/5 prices. Try this place out if you're near the Epicenter, only a 4 minute walk!",

The Collard Greens, Black Eyed Peas, Cabbage and Oh Oh Oh that Corn Bread. The banana pudding had a surprising cake bottom and perfect texture. The ice tea was perfectly sweetened.

    "text": "I give Mert's a high three stars for my first visit. It definitely delivered on my craving for a buttery, salty hot meal. Oh, and some cheese.  The hubs and I rolled up on a Saturday around 2:30 p.m., fearing that no Uptown kitchen is open at such an in-between hour. Au contraire. Mert's was packed. Inside this low-ceilinged nook with couple dozen tables, colorful accents and storied photographs lining the walls, we found couples, families and friends of all ages going to town on some comfort food.  I had the Carolina chopped BBQ, swimming in a sweet, \"secret\" sauce. Served in a side-dish bowl, the Q portion left plenty of room for gooey mac and cheese and a substantial serving of collard greens with the right amount of tang. The hubs had the lowcountry omelette, which was OK for him; he said he'd go for something more fried and/or savory next time (atta boy).  We shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes--tasty though a tad too bready and lukewarm upon arrival. The app came out after our entrees, but honestly when you've come to indulge in this kind of hearty goodness, does it matter?  And then there was the cornbread. There was a wait for it. Our server was repeatedly apologetic. But oh, was it worth it.  Our server was so very friendly and kept us happy with regular check-ins and refills on sweet tea. My only random nit was the vinyl table covering. I trust it's clean, but there's something kinda sticky about those things still. Otherwise, Mert's is a good-for-all destination for a casual feast of stick-to-your-ribs Southern cookin'.",

The good: the fried chicken was tasty (better than the fried wings on the soul sampler), the corn bread was warm and moist and good. However, the shrimp and grits was very bland, the shrimp were not overcooked, but it truly was nothing more than brown gravy on shrimp and grits, no spice or seasoning other than salt and the focaccia bread was not toasted or even warm, like a slice of white bread with some seasoning, also disappointing. The collard greens where smothered in what had to be a bouillon base or something, completely inedible and extremely disappointing for a southern girl who loves collard greens cooked with a ham hock or some salt pork-you know, the southern way! The soul roll was just weird, everything but the kitchen sink wrapped in egg roll wrapper and deep fried. The salmon cake was more salmon than cake, nice, but also lacked in seasoning- saved by the remoulade that came with it! Perhaps my problem is my southern roots are Georgia by way of Texas and Louisiana, so a little heat and deep flavor temper my taste. This place was southern food with zero flavor or heat.",

Good news was they had a bar next door so I went and had a beer then came back to get food. But had to wait another 15min. Well I actually did not like the greens it was very plain no flavor.

We sat out on the patio as it was a lovely spring day, and stuffed ourselves with the great food here.  I had the fried tilapia (special of the day) with greens and yams.  It was great, flavorful and well proportioned.  My friend had the fried chicken with mac and cheese and he was raving about it too.  To polish off the meal we split some sort of caramely cake that was heavenly.

We loved the cornbread, candied yams, collard greens, carolina chopped bbq, mac & cheese, green beans, and black eyed peas.  Generous portions too.  Full of atmosphere and it was still busy at 3pm.    We definitely recommend Mert's.",

I ordered the omlette and home fries, they both were awful. I then ordered the fried chicken,  collard greens and mac & cheese.  The chicken was not seasoned,  the greens were tough, and the mac & cheese was flavorless. Then to top it off the cornbread was dry and burnt. As if that wasn't enough we have felt sick since we ate there.",

I'll talk to you in a few minutes.\"  When several tables that had come in 30-45 minutes after us got their food and still no one apologized or told us what was wrong we left.   They didn't even seem to care!  Maybe I shouldn't have left money on the table to cover our drinks. .. Maybe then they would have cared.   I'll never try this place again!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I have been here numerous times and the food is a 10. Today, we had the fried chicken which was perfectly crispy, Mac n cheese just like your grandmothers, greens like you have never had before and the amazing cornbread. We even ordered a piece of strawberry and coconut cake to go for our 3 hour drive home. Today, I was beyond disappointed. The service was a 0. The hostess was kind and seated us-I should have left her the tip. Our server came and never made eye contact with either of us. After I told her my order she repeated something completely different. So, I repeated it again as she turned around to check out the guys who walked by to sit at the table behind us. We ordered coffee in which took 10 minutes to get and we were never offered a refill. Actually, the server did not even bring our food and only came back tothe table when it was time to take our plates. Finally, we track her down to ask for the cake and a box to go. She brings the cake but no box and seemed frustrated when I ask for the box again. My boyfriend spoke up and ask for the check. She laid it down and walked off. I decided to pay at the door only to be told to go back to my table and my server would have to take my payment. I told her I didn't want to wait. She said I will have her come up. Then, 5 minutes later she came upset and rang me up and laid the my receipt down and said you can just leave the signed copy here and walked off. Never have I ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip. Today was the first time  I have actually had my dining experience ruined by poor service. I did not leave a tip. It's really a shame because as I said the food here is exceptional but I refuse to go back to such poor customer service.",

Oh, make sure you park in the lot where they are located as this is the only lot they can offer validation for. We did save room for desert. Peach cobbler was perfect, but the strawberry cake was way too sweet. I love sweets but even this was like an overdose.",

Once I saw that they served soul food, that was it for me. For one reason it is very hard to find restaurants nowadays that are homey and laid back. It feels like home when you walk in the door. You've gotta be crazy to not like the place. They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork , that was definitely a winner for me), and lamb chops. My favorite sides are their mac & cheese, collard greens and sweet potatoes. At first taste, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I felt like I was in my Mother's kitchen again. The food is great, the staff is great and I would recommend it to anyone. Out of all the times I've gone, there was only once that I was a little displeased with what I had ordered.",

    "text": "This place is completely awesome. We were visiting from out of town and hadn't had good Southern food in over a year. So glad we found this place this past weekend (Sunday brunch/lunch). We knew it would be a good place when we saw how busy it was and that number of CLT PD was eating here - officers always seem to find the best local spots. It was amazing. I took one look at the menu and was like \"Yes, please\" - I'll take it all. There were 5 of us and we all had  a difficult time deciding. So, we each ordered a variety of things and shared.  The eggs were a litle greasier than I like, but were still good. Pork chops were outstanding - I loved the spices on them. Shrimp and grits were right on. Sweet potato pancakes  were solid - and that's saying something since I don't usually like them. The meat lovers omelette was cooked perfectly as was the BBQ omelette. One user commented that the country ham was too salty, but I didn't find that was the case at all. I grew up having that every Sunday and it brought back those memories. The fried chicken wasn't as good as my granny used to make (seriously, who's is?)  but. it was very very good.   The biscuits and cornbread were simply amazing - my mouth is watering thinking about that fresh hot cornbread. Absolutely loved it.  Sweet tea about put us in coma - straight sugar; just like it should be!  Service was hectic (place was packed) and could have been more timely to take order, but very friendly, food came out spot on hot and correctly. Drinks were refreshed without having to chase anyone down.  Price/value makes this a great place.",

The sides are always good too. The service is laid back diner style. That being said, the staff is always friendly and every time I have been there the whole room is full of happy people which goes a long way if your feeling like a stranger in town.

The tables are basic and the look and feel are simple, but this shouldn't stop you from enjoying yourself thoroughly - beginning with their tasty fresh cornbread and continuing into barbeque whether it's ribs or pulled pork.  Although this place is in North Carolina, I was happily surprised by a sauce that didn't overpower with vinegar.  On the whole, I was very happy with Mert's and will definitely go again!",

    "text": "Heard great things before going here, so I was glad to get one of those half off deals that we could go try it.  We were greeted nicely by a young lady at the desk who offered to seat us in the half empty restaurant (it was about 7:45pm on a Wednesday) directly under the flat screen TV that was blaring so loudly that we could not have heard each other.  We asked if we could be seated away from the TV but were only offered two tables, both of which were only one away from the one under the TV and there were others available further away.      We were greeted by a server that we thought was ours who asked for our drink order and he promptly got those for us and disappeared.  After several minutes, the young lady who seated us eventually came to the table and said she was our server.  She told us the specials of the night and then said unless we wanted to put in an order for an appetizer, she would be back after she put in two other orders.  It took her another 5-8 minutes to return and take our order.        Thankfully, the food didn't take as long as the ordering process did, but the server was was a bit short with me when she seemed unsure as to which plate went to whom.  After our food came, she was mostly unavailable, never offered to refill drinks, and when our 12 year old politely asked for her assistance as she passed by, she said she would be right back but didn't return for another 8 minutes or so.  The restaurant was not incredibly busy and there were 3 other servers, one of whom was on a laptop at the bar for at least 30 min. and then stood watching the TV instead of helping other servers or checking on tables.        As for the food:  Cornbread = one the best I've had.  I'm NC native.  Lived here all my life...I know cornbread.  Our youngest got the yams and a BBQ pork sandwich, both of which were very tasty...especially the pork.  Our oldest got the chicken fingers, home fries and macaroni and cheese.  He loved the mac...ordered more.  Home fries were more like potato wedges tossed with spices.  Flavor was ok, but the potatoes were dry and unimpressive.  He enjoyed the chicken fingers but didn't rave about them.  I got a veggie plate with mashed potatoes, collard greens, black-eyed peas, and a salad.  The salad consisted on one red onion slice, one cucumber slice and shredded mixed greens.  The honey mustard dressing seemed like a bottled one, though it tasted ok.  This served on a small saucer.  The black-eyed peas were good properly, but a bit bland.  The mashed potatoes were flecked with bit of the skins and had good flavor overall, but nothing exceptional.  The collards were the real star; salty, tender green goodness.  My husband got the red beans which he said were just okay, He also got the house fries, which he didn't care for, and the collards (he liked, but says his mom makes better...True,) the seasoned rice (meh) and the salad.  Nothing memorable.      We probably will not return mostly based on the inattentive service and hit or miss food.   .",

We had fried chicken (fair), beef ribs (fair) and chicken tenders (very good). The side were mac/cheese (ok), greens (very good) & green beans (loved these). Fried whiting was uneatable. If you are going to eat fried food and vegetable loaded with fat & salt, you want it to be deliciously worth the sacrifice. Second: staff. I just wanted to call them together and get them organized. It is a tight space and there were a lot of people working. The dining room needed a strong manager. Our waitress was nice but indifferent. No drink refills, had to flag her down for a condiment. Disappointing service. Finally: the ambiance: needs freshening. Mostly I wanted to clear the dining room and bring in a steam cleaner. Everything I touched was sticky. The picture with the contents sliding out of the bottom, the black check holder repaired with tape - lots of items need love here. They are small things that add up to a general lack of attention to detail. It the kind of interior you might ignore if the food was fabulous.",

We asked our waitress a number of times why we weren't getting our food, and she kept apologizing and saying \"it's on it's way.\"  But it never came.

I ordered the jumbo chicken wings with greens and mac-n-cheese as my sides.  The chicken wings were big and fried crispy, the greens were very tasty as was the mac-n-cheese.  The cornbread has to be some of the best I have ever had.  The greeens and mac-n-cheese were not the best I have ever had, but they were right up towards the top of my list.  The place was fairly busy as I expected and the service was OK.  I recieved my drink and food promptly, but my server never checked back.  I never really needed anything so I didn't suffer, but I can't give 5 stars because of that.  If you like good home cooked goodness then Mert's is the place to go.",

The only thing good about our meal was the water, orange juice and corn bread snack. Actually, the OJ was room temperature, so it was 'borderline good'.  I ordered smoked pork chops, home fries and green beans. My Mom order salmon cakes, collard greens and mac-cheese. The pork chops had a good smoke flavor, but they were too salty and paper thin. The fries were over-cooked and soft. The green beans were greasy and tasted sweet. Sometimes, people will add a little sugar to green beans if they accidentally add too much salt; I believe that was the case.  My Mom's salmon cakes were dry, the collard greens were flavorless and under cooked (probably just stir-fried) and the mac-cheese was dry.  Not only was the food bad, but it wasn't even hot and my green beans had a little solid grease on them (eeewwwww!).  I won't go back because the meal was expensive (w/tip), the parking was terrible and the food was no good.  It was a total disappointment for me. I was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant.",

We wait at the table about 5 to 7 minutes before the server comes to the table.

We waited 40 minutes for our food!!!! The woman who sat us, delivered our food, and she said it was hot, well I touched it and it was burnt and room temperature as well as my husband did not get his complete order. We were furious! Another woman brought syrup to the table and I asked for the manager and she just happen to be the manager. We voiced our complaints and she validated them because she said she saw us waiting and that no one had been to our table. She took the food back to the kitchen to show them and said we didn't have to pay for anything. She apologized and gave us a gift card and asked us to come back, the other lyrics reason I gave one star. We do not desire to return.",

First, the waiter was not attentive and rather rude.  He took our orders correctly but when the food was brought to the table, my boyfriend's order was not correct.  We know he wrote down the correct order because he read it back to us.  Evidently, the cooking staff made the error; however, we deal with the waiter and not the cooking staff so the waiter has the responsibility to make sure the customer is happy with the service.  My boyfriend ordered a catfish and chicken combo with an extra piece of catfish and I ordered a catfish and BBQ combo.  The waiter brought us my order which was correct.  My boyfriend got a BBQ and chicken as opposed to the catfish and chicken that he ordered. He told the waiter to just bring the extra piece of catfish and don't worry about the mess up; however the waiter took the whole plate back. My boyfriend waited a whole 20 minutes and did not receive his correct order.  I was done eating and he still hadn't received his food.  The waiter never came to check on us, refill drinks, update us on the status of his food, etc. By this time, we were ready to go so we told the waiter to bring us the check and to take my boyfriend's order off because he never received his food. The waiter did not apologize or anything for the crappy service.  He just dropped the bill on the table and left. We asked to speak to a manager.  After 10 minutes, a waitress came over and said that the Manager was really busy and that she'd help us with our issue.  In short, we never talked the Manager, we just paid out bill and left. Very unprofessional establishment and we don't plan on going back anytime. My boyfriend ended up getting food from Caribbean Hut where the service was excellent.",

Not sure if it was fried or shake n bake. The Mac n cheese tasted like it was cooked on the grill. Someone in our party ordered jumbo chicken wings and had to request that they be cooked more. A waiter took my MIL plate from the table without asking if she was done. They had to fix her replacement food to go. The cake wasn't fresh. The blackened chops were very good!

Southern soul/comfort food just isn't something that can be eaten 24/7.   I had a sampler platter for entree which includes beef ribs, chicken tenders, and Mert's spring rolls. The beef ribs are actually very good! The beef is quite tender and easily come off the bones, and the fact that it's beef rather than your typical port ribs made a huge difference.   The spring rolls and chicken tenders are just a little too salty, fatty and heavy-tasting for me, but I guess that's the essence of the southern soul food.  Oh, last note, their corn bread is really good, you can tell it's very fresh and home-made.",

    "text": "Charlotte is an odd city. It appears as if North Carolina needed a place to conduct financial business and girls, wearing the tightest/shortest skirts I have ever seen, needed a place to congregate. Men wearing colorful polo shirts, short pleated shorts and Italian loafers with no socks needed a place to make money and look for the short skirt women.   The whole city shuts down Saturday and Sunday except for bars and restaurants during the PM hours. Finding a good breakfast place seemed like a daunting task until we found Mert's.  This cozy soul food joint had tons of character and a solid menu. When we walked in, the smell of fried chicken and greens slam you in the face. There were two pots large enough to bath William Howard Taft slowly cooking collard greens on the stove in the back. The griddle was loaded up with bacon and pancakes. Just a beautiful sight.   I ordered eggs and country ham with home fries and a biscuit. The biscuit was so good i almost ordered another. Instead, i just ate most of my wife's. I also got a pan cake on the side. I honestly dont remember eating a better pancake in years. Lastly, i ordered fried green tomatoes. Very well done. Batter was a little hard but all in all, very good. Also, the tomatoes taste like they spent some time in the fridge.  My wife got the sweet potato pan cakes as well as fried chicken and eggs. The fried chicken was shockingly good. I could have gone back that night to eat more.  The only down side was all the eggs served to our table were under cooked. When i order over easy, i expect to have all the white cooked with a runny yolk. We all ordered over easy and there was a lot of uncooked egg white in everyone's eggs. There is a simple fix for this: order over medium!  Coffee was nice a strong. Syrup was hot. Hot sauce was already on the table. Real butter was served.",

They aren't lying when they say SOUL food. Everything about the place brought warmth to your soul. You can't go wrong with anything you order. & if you need help deciding the waitstaff was helpful in giving suggestions & favorites.   Do not miss Merts.",

The cornbread is excellent that comes out before the meal and it always seems to get gone quickly. The fried chicken is excellent and the salmon cakes are yummy as well. Especially with the sauce they give you on the side. The beef ribs were too saucy but tender. If you have to try an appetizer, try the soul rolls! They are sooo good!   The price is decent, not too expensive. Location is great but the place gets packed and its not much seating. Definitely worth the wait if you are patient enough to. Mert's is one of the best soul food places in town!",

    "text": "This place has some good and some bad, so let's start with the good: Lunch and Dinner.  The fried chicken is excellent and I don't think I would ever order anything different here.  I've had the salmon cakes and the pulled pork BBQ, both were just OK.  Just get the chicken and thank me later!  The corn bread they bring you during lunch and dinner is amazing.  It's always been piping hot and serves as a nice base for your meal.  The sides are pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but I enjoy them every time (mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, etc.).  Now for the bad: the service and breakfast fare.  I've had spotty service several times.  My mother wanted to substitute a few small things on the menu and her requests were all denied the last time we were there.  Very unaccommodating.  A small upcharge was not even suggested.  I reeeeally can't sub the biscuit for cornbread?  Come on.  I also saw her split a half bottle of Andre (Yes, the $5 bottle at the grocery store) into 6 mimosas.  I didn't taste a lick of champagne.  At $6.50 each I expect better.  The breakfast food wasn't anything to write home about either.  I got the Creole omelette and it had no flavor at all on top of having teeny, tiny shrimp.  The breakfast potatoes were the best part.  Sad.  Just avoid the breakfast food and you'll be fine.",

As we pushed open the door- we were greeted by Robin who quickly seated us, took note of my lack of accent and asked where I was from, and got us going with some great cornbread and butter as we sipped our beers and looked over the menu.   Breakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch? Well breakfast won out but only by a fraction of a point as the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans were definitely calling to me.   But I went with the omelet with ham and cheese and a side of buttermilk pancakes. My dining companion went with the eggs and country ham (ooh- that is some salty ham!) Both were served with a side of home fries. The food was great. But the service was even better.   Robin took great care of us, making sure we had everything we needed and told me I just \"had to try\" the cornbread so she brought that out as well. Loved the music- Sam Cooke, and Sam and Dave played through our entire breakfast adding to the ambiance.   This is not a fancy place. But one that serves up good food, with friendly service and reasonable prices. Breakfast for two with drinks ran about $34. Definitely on my list to go back to the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

However, that wasn't enough to even warrant a second star because the rest of my food was so unpleasant.  I started with the soul rolls, but thought the mixture of flavors and textures did not harmonize well.  It seemed to be a fried app just for the sake of being fried.  But without the pleasing crunch I expected. But the real let down was my shrimp and grits.  What they served me was a bowl of lumpy grits (one particular lump was too big for my spoon to handle) swimming in a truly awful brown mess.  The color made me think the sauce might be rich, but it was the opposite.  I could probably recreate the flavor with water, thickener and food color - that is just how tasteless it was.  The shrimp had a strange texture that made me think it came from a can.  Then someone had chopped raw green onion and stirred it in.  That was it.  No seasoning.  No flavor.",

I'm not a big cornbread fan, but slap some butter on this stuff and it's quite amazing.  Our server recommended the ribs, and so I ordered them with the yardbird, mac and cheese and greens. All around great. The ribs were falling off the bone, the yardbird and very good. The mac and cheese was stellar and the greens were some of the best I've tasted in North Carolina.  I finished my meal with the peach cobbler, which was fine, but not great. I kinda wished they had more chocolate options here. I would most certainly come here again.",

The green beans were cooked just how I like them. Also to die for that we got to try, the shrimp n grits, beef short ribs, and the pound cake.

Salmon cakes had lost their crispness on the outside, but the flavor was delicious. The greens were leafy and large and JUST RIGHT! And god bless the mac & cheese.

And I like eating at places that are independently owned small businesses. But the food left me only half impressed.   I had the Southern Fried Chicken Breast with Collard Greens and Black Eyed Peas. Unfortunately the Collard Greens was all that I was impressed with. It tasted amazing and topping them with freshly diced onions and tomatoes were a nice touch. But the Fried Chicken and Black Eyed Peas were just EH~. I expected the Fried Chicken to have more flavor. But it didn't. It also tasted too dry and not moist at all. I also expected the Black Eyed Peas to have more flavor or richness to them since they are usually made with bacon or ham hock. But it didn't. And the only thing good about the cornbread, in my opinion, was the honey butter that it came with.   Now I do have to admit it was my first time eating here. And I'm sure there are probably other items on the menu I would have enjoyed just as much as the Collard Greens. But with any restaurant I go to, first impressions matter. My theory is with any good restaurant their entire menu is good no matter what you order, which is what makes me want to go back, make it a favorite destination, and want to keep going back to try EVERYTHING. But I'm going to have to think twice about this place since there was some hits and misses, which is a shame b/c I do love soul food.",

    "text": "Awesome fried chicken.  I really wanted to go to Price's but since the conference I was attending ended pretty late, I had to get my chicken fix somewhere else and ended up at Mert's.  I got there around 8 and found the restaurant to be somewhat empty.  Rather than eating there, I decided I would have a better time eating back at my hotel since there wasn't much going on at the restaurant.  It wasn't until on the walk back I realized that the steam from the hot foods probably softened up the fried chicken!  I was prepared to be disappointed...  BUT the amazing thing was that the chicken leg quarter that I ordered was not only juicy, but the skin had somehow retain much of it's crispiness.  As I start to gnaw into the fried chicken, with each bite I was amazed at how flavorful it is.  Didn't need any sauce or anything, it was tasty as is.  Like I mentioned, the chicken is juicy.  Dark meat is always the way to go for me for fried chicken!  With the fried chicken, I also got to choose two sides, so I went for the yams and mac & cheese.  Lots of spices for the yams, and I like how it still retained its chunky form.  As for the mac & cheese, I only liked the part where the cheese had caramelized.  Not too special to me.  It also comes with this awesome cornbread and softened sweet butter.  Cornbread + butter is seriously one of the best combos.  I know butter is good with a lot of things, but when you have a tasty cornbread, butter just enhances it so well!  Even with it steaming in its own heat for around 10 minutes as I walked back to the hotel, the chicken was still awesome.  I can only imagine how great it would've been if I ate there!",

    "text": "I'll admit that I was a little disappointed to find that Mert's is a \"semi-touristy diner\" in Uptown.  (The downside being that panhandlers interrupt your meal, if you eat outside.)  I was expecting a down and dirty hole-in-the-wall place, but the food more than made up for the location and decor.  The cornbread was hot and delicious with sweet butter.  The salmon cakes were actually all salmon - no filler fish - and seared rather than breaded and fried.  The red remoulade sauce paired perfectly with the salmon cakes.  The delicious mac & cheese was baked and thick rather than just spooned from a pot.  The sweetness of the candied yams were just right to balance out the savory salmon and mac & cheese.  The waitress was amazingly friendly - reminded me of a happy drunk.  I asked her what's good, and she went through just about everything - I could tell that she eats the food rather than reciting what customers usually get.  The funniest part was her saying, \"My three favorite sides are...\" and then listing five and having to whittle down to three - mac & cheese, collard greens, and yams.  Big tip for her!  The local beer on tap is Carolina Blond, and the local wine is Biltmore.  (I thought the Merlot was just ok.)  Prices are a bit higher ($10-20), as expected for Uptown, but I think the salmon cakes with choice of two sides and cornbread are the best deal at $10.",

OH my! can't forget their corn bread warm and crispy on top it just fell apart in softness and goodness of flavor. I heard their Mac&cheese and Yums are very good as well, I didn't get a chance to try them it was just like a home cooked meal, very reasonable prices, is not a fancy place, just a casual atmosphere. If you are visiting the city and want to enjoy some southern flavor, stop by at Mert's you will enjoy it.",

Macaroni and Cheese (the Baked kind) and Collard Greens garnished with Onions, Tomatoes, and Bacon.  All made \"with Love\"  It was all Incredible!!!  For Dessert I had Fried Chicken!!!",

I ordered a catfish, collard greens, and acorn squash for me, and a beef tips, mac n' cheese, and collard greens for the special guy picking me up from the airport. I gobbled down the cornbread right away, it was so delicious. Now I know nothing tastes as good as when it's first made, but for surviving a 10-hour trip, these meals were pretty darn good.

I have to say I barely liked my meal. The meatloaf was dry, even though the chef was kind enough to squirt some ketchup on there. The macaroni and cheese I suppose was better than the Blue Box, but I've had muuuuch better. It wasn't nasty, like some places I've tried, but it definitely wasn't good. The purple cabbage was pretty tasty though.  The meal was so lackluster that I was left craving my stepmother's meatloaf and macaroni and cheese (mmmmm). Maybe I went on a bad day, but for my first experience, it was disappointing.  Also the cakes they had on display at the counter looked sooooo dry, really unappetizing.",

The soul rolls are 6.29 and small. Merts could improve by making a larger roll so you can actually see meaty pieces of chicken and collard green etc....On top of that they were burnt around the edges but still delivered to our table with an excuse that they were slammed with a Sunday church rush and having a hard time providing A1 service. When asked to speak to a manager they never arrived, instead sent messages via the server which were clearly not customer focused. Management should be walking around and visiting the customers to make sure the food is good and customers are happy.   I don't know what Guy Fieri was talking about when he said the soul rolls were spectacular...He lied. The cornbread is excellent...I also loved the Mac and cheese and salmon cakes too. Go but don't expect to be blown away by the overall experience",

We happened to be staying blocks from Merts and hoped this would be a positive hit on our travels in NC. BINGO....It was.  We first walked through the door  and the hostess was so friendly and pleasant.  I guess she was the poster child for \"Southern Hospitality.\" The place is warm and looks fairly new, but there are pictures all over the wall of different types of people and autographed posters of actors/actresses from Broadway plays from over the years.   We ate around 11AM on Saturday, breakfast was still available, as well as lunch items. I opted for lunch items because it had catfish and I am a sucker for catfish from soul food restaurants.  My boyfriend got a breakfast platter and my other friends got fried chicken and salmon cakes.  The catfish was seasoned to perfection.  If it wasn't for the fact that they give you the entire fish, including the tail and bones, I would have ate every single piece of that fish.  However, the fish did fall off the bone easily, but its a mental thing for me.  I did receive mac n cheese with it, which was good as well.  The salmon cakes were good as well.  I did not taste the large portions of fried chicken, but my friend did say it was very good.  Didn't taste the breakfast either, but the plate was squeaky clean after 5 minutes.  They have desserts, but we were so full by the time we ate half of our meals that we couldn't even fathom another bite.  But I would love to go there to have their banana pudding or lemon cake again.  We tried to go there again on Monday {Labor Day} but it was closed.  I am now trying to move to Charlotte and this restaurant would easily be a Sunday Dinner spot for me.",

When I arrived it was really busy but they found a table for me right away (table of 1 when it's busy-waitresses nightmare!).  The atmosphere was really relaxed and fun. I was seated close to the food window so it had a great diner feel to the place being so close to the chefs.   I ordered the Fried Catfish based on reading the reviews and looking through the pics and I very much anticipated the arrival of the \"Yelp famous\" cornbread. It did NOT disappoint!!! It was cooked perfect and was moist and fluffy. The sweet butter went quick and I had to ask for more (which they brought right away). The catfish was superb and tasted surprisingly light and the remoulade sauce....I mean come on! It was so tasty! I had the Mac n cheese and green beans as sides and they were fantastic. My dinner with a drink was $17. I wanted to keep eating but alas I couldn't keep up with the southern portions but made a more than valiant effort!  My waitress was working her tail feathers off and was extremely kind and attentive.",

I wanted to try the famous salmon cakes and they did not dissapoint. Was trying to stay on the healthy side so I got collard greens and rice. The rice had great flavor! My boyfriend got the fried catfish and I was surprised at how good it was! Absolutely delicious. Did not care for the mac and cheese. Did not taste homemade like I expected. My favorite thing was the remolaude they served with both of our dishes, I would put that on anything and everything.",

We both had the fried chicken, she had mashed potatoes and collards for sides whereas I went with the mac and cheese and black-eyed peas. Then, as our plates were cleared and we paid our checks, we wanted to sit for a few more minutes before leaving. It was way before closing time so that was no reason to do what our server did, plop and wet dish towel on our table right in front of us as she passed which we assumed was a signal to leave.   How disgusting. We tried to be this \"fancy\" Uptown and then something like this is just a little embarrassing, don't you think?",

Knowing I had important business the next day, I couldn't take any chances with my stomach. My safety order of Buttermilk Fried Chicken Fingers ended up way too salty after a while. The sides of roasted potatoes and mac & cheese were just okay, nothing too mind blowing.  I wouldn't disregard this place completely after 1 visit since my party thought their orders were decent. Decent enough to put them into a food coma at 1:00 PM. Perhaps it was a bad day/I should've ordered something else.  Dat cornbread doe. Spot on.",

Mert's did that for me.  I ordered the beef ribs and was a little disappointed, but that's what happens when you live in the BBQ capital of the world for about 8 years (TX).  Aside from that, the sides were just as good as it gets.  I love that they cook their greens with vinegar which is such a southern thing.  I threw a couple of drops of Texas Pete on there and my taste buds were in heaven.  Their famous salmon cakes were a bit dry for my taste.  Maybe I caught a bad batch, but I'd like to believe that they can be waaay more tender and moist.  The wait staff were so funny and friendly.  I felt completely at home.  I'm hoping they expand soon because seating does get tight!  We were seated by the exit door and on a 30 something degree night it literally takes the warmth away from the atmosphere and my food, lol!  I don't care what any of the nay-sayers say, Merts is good stuff!  If you want to see things get better for next time, just say so.  Yelp is powerful and most businesses take what we say to heart as long as it's constructive and comes from a place of caring and not cynicism.",

How can you make an ordinary dish so exciting?  The yams were a desert all their own.  We finished the meal with a red velvet cake by recommendation and it was not as good as the recommendation.  It was a great experience that I really enjoyed. Thanks Harold from the Hyatt for the recommendation.",

When I arrived my food was ready and still fairly warm which I appreciate. There is a big lunch crowd but again I didn't have any issues when I arrived to pickup my food.   The fried chicken was the best part of the meal. it was fried perfectly and tasted great not overpowering at all.   The collard greens were good, not the best I've had yet good. They normally come topped with tomatoes and onions. I requested mine on the side.   The macaroni and cheese, was subpar. I expected a little better coming from a soul food restaurant nonetheless I ate it.   Again, overall this restaurant was good and I def will be recommending it to my friends and all others that visit Charlotte.",

We quickly noticed that we were the only white guys in the restaurant.  No problem, we were looking forward to a good meal.  After sitting for a while we never got the apps we ordered.  Then we noticed that others who came in after us were served before us.  Letting the minutes go by and still no apps or entree, we started to get suspicious.  Were we being racially discriminated against?  Couldn't help but think it.  More minutes went by and finally the waiter was taken aback when he realized we never got out apps.  To his credit, he apologized and comped the apps.  Finally we got our entrees and the apps came after that.  Did we complain?  No.  We continued our conversation like nothing happened.  And BTW, I ordered shrimp and grits that was so bland.  No flavor whatsoever.",

The hockey itself was crispy and not too oily.   The CORNBREAD was the best I've ever had--hot and fresh from the oven!

I had to try the acorn squash because it was such a unique thing to find on a menu. I hope this is done as a special side on a regular basis. It was so tender that I even ate the skin! The potato salad should satisfy any fans of the traditional southern variety.   Service was friendly and efficient and the price was certainly reasonable.  Keep up the good work!",

I was hoping for a tasty soul food meal when in fact, I ended up with a bad waiter & undercooked wings! I was very upset, as hungry as i was, i was truly looking forward to the food i ordered. Because we felt neglected by our waiter, we requested another! This one took our wings back to put them right in the fryer! Why didn't I deserve fresh wings if I'm paying a fresh wing price?? Anyways, please do better.",

The waiter never came to check up on us we had to ask another waiter to ask to get new chicken. A manager came over and took our chicken that's been on our plate touched on and stuff and put it back in the fryer. They did not make us new chicken they just placed it right back in the fryer. I was very disgusted by that and the fact that that's even an option for this restaurant is disgusting. Please do not waste your money on this uncooked, bland, nasty and definitely not soul food restaurant.",

I work Uptown so I decided to check it out for lunch. I was in and out in less than 45 minutes so it's great if you want a home cooked meal and only have an hour lunch break.  Chicken tenders are outstanding! I opted for the homemade bbq sauce and ranch for dipping. The macaroni and cheese was good but could have used some more cheese. The okra and tomatoes were delicious! It was more like a stewed tomato so be prepared for a warm side dish.   Service was great and the place seemed very clean!",

    "text": "I ate at Mert's twice a few years ago and was never impressed. However, I decided to give them another try. Unfortunately, I do not plan to come back.   We were there for Sunday breakfast, before it got busy. I ordered the pork chop with scrambled and eggs and grits. The service was relatively quick. However, the chop seemed to have no salt and was way overcooked. Salt can always be added but since the chop was tough and burned, I felt I had no choice to send it back. My mouth was ready for a chop so I just asked for a replacement.   Although the server was trying to be his best version of nice (I could see the struggle) -- my complaint was obviously personal to both him and the chef. After speaking to the chef he returned to my table to tell me that they won't be able to cook the meat any differently and that pork chops are always tough. He asked if I'd like to order something else. He must have seen that I was surprised. (as a native southerner and soul food shoveler it didn't make sense to me) So he told me twice that the chef knows his 'meat products'. The second time he was already walking away and calling back over his shoulder.  I decided not to argue to inform him that the chef just needed a shorter cooking time on each side, plus salt tenderizes especially if you brine.   But whatever -- I decided to order the shrimp and grits which was not a bad dish. The brown gravy was tasty and the shrimp were cooked to the correct texture.  The place is beautifully decorated with soulful music playing and Black American memorabilia on display. They also have a patio. The table cloth was sticky, but that is my only complaint about the environment.  I think this restaurant better suits the palates of people who do not eat  Southern soul food frequently.",

The bad thing about Mert's is that they can be packed at almost any time. That means you can wait to get in and wait to order and wait to get your food. Luckily you do not have to wait to actually eat said food once it is delivered and that is nice.  As to the food itself it is generally awesome but sometimes you can get bits that are just average but that can mostly be due to having to wait so much so try and enjoy it as many places top out at average.",

Is it filling food that will leave you satisfied on the way out, absolutely.  Mert's side dishes should not be missed. I ordered them a la carte with my Soul Sampler. I was fortunate that my scoop of macaroni and cheese was the top layer so I got both the cheesy crusty and gooey middle.  Now, my biggest bone to pick is with what they call \"unlimited mimosas.\" You've got a lot of nerve pouring 2 oz cups of champagne in a big ol cup of orange juice, calling that a mimosa and charging $9 ($17 for unlimited). My guess is that this was a decision made by management to under pour and rip people off. If you're looking for a boozy lunch/brunch, Mert's is not the place.",

After another sever came out to deliver our appetizers I had to ask him for some refills as Brittany never came to pour us anymore water or lemonade after the first pour.

I tried the creole shrimp + fried catfish combo.  They also give you a small loaf of sweet cornbread; very moist and delicious.  There was so much food I boxed up half for later.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their meals, as well.  Our server was super nice and took great care of us throughout the meal.  No wait for a table and food was prepped and delivered in a timely manner; not too shabby for a post-Sunday church crowd.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is my creole shrimp had only 4 very small shrimp in it.  I was really surprised at that.  The flavor of the stewed veggies over rice was great but not what I paid $18 for.  I would also agree with other reviewers that their mac & cheese is not great.  It's not bad, though!  Just average, which is a shame since I would expect to get a solid mac & cheese in a place like this.  It was fine as a compliment to my meal but I would not go out of my way to order it.  Side note:  As with any Uptown establishment, parking is a challenge during the workday and on Sundays (street parking full from churchgoers), so I recommend going in the evening or daytime Saturday.  Otherwise, you'll pay $$$ to park.",

As a whole, the restaurant  had poor service and I don't believe I would ever visit again.

On to the food... I ordered the fried chicken with green beans and yams. First, the conbread with the butter.... AMAZING!!! I ended up buying two to go. The chicken was good I was expecting and thinking the fried chicken should have more crunch. The skin was a little more chewy then I would normally like. The green beans and the yams were meh... Overall, the service was great, the food was okay but the cornbread was delicious and worth the whole trip. Would I come back... sure! I would probably order something else on the menu...",

From the menu, I picked the fried chicken meal with collard greens and mac-n-cheese.  The fried chicken was quite good, juicy with a crispy exterior. The greens were a-ok--seems like there too much vinegar in it.  The mac-n-cheese was grainy and mealy (i.e., not smooth).  Value-wise, it's a great deal.  With that large-portion meal and a drink, it was a little over 10 bucks!",

Our server 'fessed up it was made with mayo when I pressed for deets.  Lawdy have mercy!  It was durn good though.  The fried chicken was just as excellent as you expect.  Collards and okra got a thumbs up from me.  Okay - now for the negs - The salmon cakes were downright not good.   Disappointing, as they were touted as a featured menu item on their website.  I wonder if I just got them on a bad day??  They were mushy, with no discernible salmon chunks, and flavorless, desperately needing spices or at least salt.  I saw and tasted no evidence of the mirepoix and Cajun spices described as part of the dish.  Hubs didn't like his green beans (too sweet) and home fries (too bland, not fried long enough).    I like the vibe of the space a lot.  But it does seem a little dirty.  Also our server was very friendly but repeatedly sneezed into the crook of her arm and just kept on serving.  Um, kinda gross from a customer perspective.  She also mixed our ticket up with another tables, but then let us know that she would cover the extra on their ticket for us.  They were busy.  These things happen.    All in all, I think this is worth a visit for out of towners, especially if you are staying right down town.  But, I'll try somewhere else next time I'm in Charlotte - hence 3 stars.",

    "text": "This place was a huge disappointment- unfortunately.  Made a special trip downtown to eat here after picking up a friend from the airport before heading out on the road.  First of all, this location is downtown- very limited parking- so be prepared to pay to park unless you get lucky and get an actual available street spot- very unlikely though.  We found parking in a garage and had to pay $8....umm, not cool!  Upon arriving at the restaurant- it was very slow- but it was around 3 pm.  The ambiance was good and our server was polite and semi-attentive.   The cornbread is great; yet they are pretty stingy with the butter....so be prepared to request more or use sparingly especially if sharing.  I ordered the fried catfish along with yams & Mac n' cheese.  The catfish tasted really muddy/dirty - such a disappointment because it had a great batter on it- but I had to drown it in their unimpressive  and tasteless tartar sauce and some siracha ketchup just to drown out the dirt taste.....the yams were so-so and the Mac n' cheese wasn't very memorable.  The other person in my party ordered the vegetable plate....again yams, Mac n' cheese, and potato salad....her comments matched mine in the similar dishes and as for the potato salad- her comments were that it was just ok.   She got a garden Salad and it was the smallest-saddest little garden salad.  I suppose that maybe since this restaurant was featured in triple \"D\" - then we had high expectations....just wasn't blown away by our meal and there was nothing to crave to make me want to come back.  So disappointed.....",

    "text": "We've been living in Charlotte for a year now, and we've been to quite a few restaurants in our time. However, while I have found that perfect BBQ joint I dreamed of, I had not yet happened across the quintessential place for good ol' Southern cooking...in particular fried chicken. Well, that is now a thing of the past, for I have found Merts.  You could tell just from walking inside that it was going to be a great Southern food experience. The interior of the restaurant is colorful and eye-catching, and the art and decor screams Southern. The interior was full to capacity, but we were able to snag a table outside. The outdoor area is a mixed bag. While it's nowhere near as crowded as inside (with only four tables or so) the Charlotte pedestrians take it upon themselves to walk through the outdoor area. It was a bit disruptive to be eating a nice meal while people constantly walked right against your table.   I wasn't a fan of the beer list since Merts does not carry any drafts, so I stuck with unsweet tea. After placing our orders the server came over with a small loaf of cornbread for each of us. This cornbread was spot on for me! Not gritty, a little sweet and extremely crumbly. You could tell it was fresh from the oven, and that made it super awesome!  For dinner I ordered the beef ribs and leg quarter fried chicken combo. I wasn't crazy about the ribs themselves, as they were a bit tough and chunks of bone kept flaking off. I did enjoy the sauce, as it was a sweet and tangy sauce and not vinegary. Now the chicken was THE BOMB! I've been searching for fried chicken down here, and have been disappointed time and again. So far I am confident to say that Merts has the best fried chicken (though I haven't made it over to Price's yet, so don't jump on me for that yet.) The battered skin was light and crisp, and not greasy. The interior was that moist and juicy you expect from fried chicken. I was in heaven scoffing that chicken down, and I wish I had more right now!   The miss' ordered the catfish and fried chicken breast combo, and that was also pretty dang awesome. The catfish was a huge filet just plopped on the plate. The meat came right off and was so light and tasty. The batter was also perfect, with not too much that didn't take away from the soft flavor of the fish. They serve it with this spicy sauce that was a good compliment to the fish. The chicken breast was just as good as my leg. Even the white meat stayed juicy and tender! The miss' didn't eat too much of it after filling up on the fish, so there are plenty of chicken leftovers in my future!  The other thing that Merts does damn good is sides. One problem I've had at BBQ and other places down here is that the meats are perfect, yet the sides are extremely lacking. Merts has some of the best dang sides money can buy. We both ordered the mac & cheese and it was simply the best I've had down here. Some places I've been to make it watery or oily or just not flavored right, but Merts had it all. It was a firm consistency with a great cheesy flavor, and the cheese crust on top was awesome. I also tried black eyed peas for the first time and loved them. They were cooked perfectly and were served in this kind of gravy that was also tasty. The miss' ordered the collard greens and I have to say that I liked those too. I'm generally not a fan of collards as they are bitter, but these were cooked in such a way that the bitterness was taken down a notch or two. They had some citrus flavoring to them that helped tone it down and added a different level of flavor to. All in all, the sides kicked butt! Unfortunately we were so stuffed from this massive meal that we did not stick around for dessert.  I have to say, when I think home cooked Southern fare, I will always associate it with Merts. They can fry up some mean chicken and fish, and their sides and veggies are top notch. It's a busy place but it is definitely worth the trip.",

Fried chicken isn't something I usually get, but the fried chicken wings (no sauce on them) were killer. It's such a cool unusual place to visit - you feel like you stepped back in time.

Not the best that I've had, but a good balance between moist and dry.  - Macaroni + Cheese, was good, nothing too special, but still good.  - Service.  Was great.

This is where I take my out-of-town friends, especially ones who have never experienced what a brick of cornbread looks like, especially one that comes with housemade honey butter. The tea ninjas (or wait-staff) make sure our cups never runneth empty and might tell us some jokes here and there. We'd always eat our vegetables if they were like the ones here: macaroni and cheese (I know, not a vegetable), collard greens (got a little pico de gallo), and the okra stew are some of the best. The Daily Fixin's have some classic choices like fried chicken and catfish, but I really love the salmon cakes, which come with sauce that'd be great on burgers. You'll be fuller than a piggy bank on pay day, but some banana puddin'(g) is a spectacular dessert.  I love the album cover decorations and the music that comes from them-all Motown and Stax classics. Soul music is where a lot of the \"Soul\" comes from; the rest is from the quirky decor and the buzzing of conversation from families out to dinner or couples before/after a play. The whole place has old theatre posters and sepia photographs, not because it's \"cool,\" but because Mert's is a beloved part of Charlotte. The bankers across the street even banded together to keep it afloat during a rough financial period. Say what you will about their handling of the economic crisis, but fiscal cliffs have got nothing on Mert's.  It owns my heart, soul, and if I ever have children, maybe even my first-born.",

Diabetic onset sweet-tea and lemonade are sooo refreshing to wash down this soul-food.  Prices are very reasonable and you will nvr leave there hungry.  Service is great and I alwayz park in the parking deck around the corner.",

Unassuming from the outside, it does indeed have a lot f heart and soul--you sense it as you walk into this quaint, friendly establishment. Ok, enough heart and soul usages.   Picture a backyard BBQ indoors, and that's Mert's. Friendly, knowledgeable waiters treat you like family. It's a great environment in which to enjoy a laid-back BBQ meal.   Speaking of BBQ, this place makes great stuff, and a lot of people think it's the best--or most authentic--in Charlotte. Great meat-and-three action here--try the collards and the pulled pork. The fried chicken is amazing, too, so get yourself some of that.   Simple domestic beers in bottles, which is the perfect touch to the home-cooking you're getting here. Check it out--definitely a nice change of pace from most of what you'll find downtown.",

Also, the first time I went the server accidentally broke the heat lamp right above the food...she stared at it as if she didn't know just what to do, and just picked a few pieces of glass out of the greens...which ended up being MY greens, so I didn't eat them.   But my mouth is watering at this very moment thinking about that cornbread.",

I grew up eating most of the food on the menu, and I tend to make strong comparisons against that home cooking.  In addition, I love food, and I have a wide taste bud ranging from various regions of the world.  The food was delivered to me at my table very very very very very hot.  I was unable to comfortably eat for approx. 7 to 10 minutes.   I ordered Fried Chicken, Greens, Yams, Catfish, and Banana Pudding.  The previous day, my business colleague order and ate the red beans and rice.  Service was good.  The menu needs help.  1) The Fried Chicken wasn't really fried.  It looked like baked chicken that was dried out.  Not crispy looking, not seasoned. Not very tasty. 2) The Catfish was a complete fish with bones.  The taste was pretty good! However, I would have enjoyed it more had I not had to de-bone every bite. 3) The Greens were good! 4) Yams were good! 5) Corn bread was just ok 6) Banana Pudding was very good! 7) Red beans rice and sausage was not good.  All and all, the Merts was just ok,  However, if in town again, I would not be compelled to re-visit...and I love Soul Food.",

We ordered the fried tomatoes and soul rolls for the appetizers, but they messed up our order and gave us the soul sampler instead. That included a soul roll, corn bread, ribs, and chicken. The tomatoes were good in my opinion but my friend said he'd had better (he lived in Atlanta for several years). For dinner I had the fried catfish and chicken leg quarter, with the mac & cheese and cole slaw on the side. I did not like the cole slaw at all...I think it had pickles in it and that threw off the taste for me. Mac and cheese=awesome. The chicken and catfish were both average...tasty but nothing I would HAVE to return for. We were SO full after it all, but still ordered some cake to go. They have several cake options, including lemon, orange, strawberry, and sweet potato. I went with the sweet potato with cream cheese frosting. Very tasty but not much different than carrot cake minus the raisins & nuts.  Our server was such a sweetheart so that made the experience 4 stars for me!",

The location was right in downtown, but there was no problem finding on-street parking on a week night around dinner time.    We ordered the Soul Sampler, the Southern Sampler, and a side of collard greens, and some sweet tea.  I liked their sweet tea, with the perfect amount of sweetness.  The corn bread lives up to the hype, it had a nice crusty outside and soft inside, and came with soft butter with just a hint of sweetness.  As for the Soul sampler - I didnt care of the \"soul rolls\" (they were like eggrolls with collard greens inside), and the ribs were not your normal ribs (lots of tendons in the meat), but the buttermilk chicken was crispy outside and very tender inside.  As for the Southern sampler - the salmon cakes were flavorful, I liked them, though my hubby thought they were too soggy.  Nothing remarkable about the chicken wings or the fried green tomatoes.  FYI - it seems like each sampler, only comes with 1 piece of cornbread, so if you need more for your party, you may need to order additional as sides. As for the collard greens, the portion was plentiful, but it was too vinegary for my taste.",

I like trying small businesses and supporting them. With that said...Mert's was disappointing and overpriced. The fried chicken was bland, you should not have to put salt on fried chicken. The Mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best. The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!!! Horrible!!! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food. It's too bad I have to leave this review because I love supporting small businesses and especially black operated small businesses. Yuck!",

We did not think the food lived up to the hype...at all. Lemonade...not freshly squeezed, even though the server said everything is made in house and fresh. Cornbread and Soul Roll...best part of the meal. Anything fried....TOO GREASY. I got fried catfish and my plate was covered in grease and whenever my fork went into the fish, more grease would spill out...EW! One food runner, female, came to our table with the wrong food. After no one claimed the wrong food she says, \"Do yall even know what you ordered?!\".....ummm CLEARLY you just have the wrong food. Let's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal. Someone in the kitchen needs to change the oil, drain the food with a napkin (simple) and avoid getting grease on the entire plate. The yams tasted like they were drenched in maple syrup...and that's it....not good at all. My moms cooks better soul food.",

Another companion was thrilled with her macaroni and cheese. And another companion had a four veggie plate meal which she loved. I wish my meal had not filled me up because they had the most beautiful cakes I've ever seen. I think it might be worth a trip back just to have desert. If they'd been open after the play we would have gone back for a slice of one of those cakes. Prices are unbelievably low and the service is excellent. Great atmosphere.

The food was served in record time (by   dine-in restaurant standards-7 minutes. 3. The restaurant was clean and well maintained.  While all of the aforementioned are integral to a good dining experience I think most would agree that the food should top the list. Not so much here.  I ordered the barbeque ribs based on the server's recommendation. Bad idea. For essentially $15 (including tax) you are given one rib cut into five pieces. The rib (s) were overcooked in some places, comprised of fat and gristle, and were both and tasteless. The side dishes followed suit.

I told \"them\" we had been on the phone waiting when \"they\" hung up - so the question is...do we have to continue to wait b/c of bad service.   She sneered and then I..um..no...it will still be 20 more minutes - with no apologies.  So, some managers, personnel, are not concerned with local, repeat customers or just doing the right thing.  The disrespect and disregard exhibited stung - as though I was not a paying customer willing to compensate for what I ordered.  Deuces and Done!  (Gotta make g-d mac and cheez now smh)",

    "text": "We've had the pleasure of experiencing Mert's dine in and takeout. I must say, I definitely recommend dine in over takeout. The quality of the entree is very inconsistent. We tried takeout first, I got the salmon salmon cake entree while the bf ordered the fried chicken plate. We got the mac and cheese, red bean, and mashed potato side. It took FOREVER TO PICK UP, and we even arrived 15 minutes after they said it was ready. I was waiting at the cashier stand for another 15-20 minutes. Upon arriving back home, I was sad to find that my salmon cakes were not as large or fluffy as depicted on the groupon picture or the dine in pictures on Yelp. They tasted great tho, the remoulade was flavorful and paired well for this meal. The mac and cheese was our favorite side, followed by the creamy mashed potatoes (made out of red potatoes for a twist). The red beans didn't have that much flavor. However, the sides were not as large as I had hoped. The cornbread was sooo good! I read on the website the moisture comes from some mayo  added to the mix. Overall good quality, I just expected more food, it didn't even cover half of the tin takeout tray that it was served in.   Fast forward to last week, this time we got the dine in groupon. Luckily, not nearly as crowded as it was the first time I walked in. I ordered the exact same thing while the bf got a chicken po boy and some home fries. This time, the salmon patties were a good size but, did not taste as good as the takeout I had earlier. It almost seemed as if it were canned tune, did not have the consistency of a home cooked patty...unless it spent an hour in the food processor. The sides were good as before. The bf's po boy was huge and stuffed with fresh chicken tenders. I thought it needed some more remoulade, it was a little dry but, tasty and hearty.   I want to come back here again, but it is a hit or a miss. I would stick to dine in if I were you. Cheers!",

    "text": "So it took three trips but I think I'm finally starting to become a fan of Merts.  My first visit was to pick up some catering for an event and I didn't get a chance to try anything. The second visit was a bust I ordered the chicken wings, cabbage and seasoned rice. Meh, I've had better everything. The chicken wings were just okay, and the cabbage and rice didn't have enough seasoning for my tastes.   But this last visit was much better.   We started with the Soul Rolls which come stuffed with chicken, rice, greens and black eye peas. They come topped with a spicy honey mustard sauce and were very good. They were crispy and packed with the filling. I'd recommend them. They also bring out some cornbread and that was definitely a highlight for me! It was warm and with some butter....it practically melts in your mouth.   For my meal I had the pork chops, macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. I was impressed with the amount of food you get! Two juicy and well seasoned (yay!) pork chops blackened with delicious seasoning. Very good. For me, the sides were just okay again. I'm not sure what to get that will give me that \"amazing\" feel but I guess I'll keep trying....  I couldn't leave without trying some dessert so I ordered the strawberry cake. It was very very moist and delicious.   So overall a much better visit this go round...I'll make my way back and give this place another try to see if they can officially win me over.",

I had the salmon cakes with mac and cheese and home fries. The cakes weren't quite as good as what my mom used to make but pretty close. The sides were delicious too. Other dishes ordered at the table included a vegetable plate and fried green tomatoes, all of which went over well. One of my pals wanted a beer and was told that they were out of several on the menu, which another reviewer mentioned as a problem here. Service was friendly but not the most attentive--the sweet tea was darn good and I could have used more refills. I'd still go for five stars if not for how hot the dining room was. I don't know if the AC was broken or what but it was warm enough that I kept hoping for someone to walk by the table to create a breeze for a second. Still the food was tasty enough to make me plan on coming back!",

We were seated at our table, and waited and two other tables were seated within the 10 minutes that we were seated. The waitress finally came out and instead of coming to our table she went to another table that was seated 10min after we had been seated. When we tried to get her attention she said excuse me I'll be with you in a moment and didn't bother to let us talk. When she finally got to us 16min after we were seated she didn't even bother to respond to us when we told her, she just took our drink order and said I'll be right back to get your food order. We have been waiting 16 min so we knew what we wanted to eat. We finally got our food order in, and it took about 30 min for it to come to the table. We had asked for some sauce and never got them (they were suppose to come with the dish). At this point we had given up. She finally came by and asked me why I hadn't touched some of my food and I didn't bother saying because I never got the sauce I just said I was full. We asked for the check because we were ready to get out of their. We didn't see the waitress for 10min, asked again after having to flag her down and she said yeah yeah and that is when we debated on just leaving some cash on the table and she wouldn't have a tip or keep waiting. She finally showed up with our bill min later. To get out of their fast I paid cash for everyone's bill, I'm a honest person but I feel like if she didn't show up soon we would have just left. I never felt so bad after visiting a place.",

The 3 stars are for the following reasons: 1) as soon as our food was served, the waiter gave us the bill. He said he wasnt rushing us but who gives you the bill before even have taken 1 bite of your food. 2) when the waiter came to check up on us he saw i was paused eating my food. In other words i was taking my time. I even told him. He immediately insisted in bringing a box. Didnt even ask us if we wanted dessert. The cakes looked bomb but we didnt even get a chance to order it. 3) overall we felt very rushed. Our waiter was a cool guy but he really made us feel like we needed to eat quick and get the f out.   The whole giving us the bill right before even eating our food was weird. He did it to no one else who was sitting around us.   Anyways good food. Nice staff. But our waiter killed it by rushing us out of there.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Merts for several years but on today, I experienced the worst customer service ever and will never go back as a result.  After I ordered the smoked pork chop special, with mac & cheese, and green beans, I waited OVER 30 minutes before I received my food. My friend and I counted approximately 6 tables who came in after us, but received their food BEFORE us, including one table that had the same entree as me. The waitress, whom I had no issue with, kept promising the meal was on the  way. At the time we first entered the restaurant, it was not busy at all. When the plate finally came out, there were collards mixed in with my green beans, but I didn't send it back. When the check came, I called the manager over and asked that my meal be comped in some form due to the wait time and watching the folks who received their meal before us. The manager absolutely refused to offer any type of discount, just a verbal apology and in my opinion, an unacceptable explanation of the wait time and why others received their orders before us. (It's been my experience that most restaurant specials are pre-cooked in preparation for the potential orders, and usually would come out first!). After going back and forth with the manager for several minutes about my experience and why I felt the meal should be discounted in some form, I continually received nothing more than verbal apologies. I finally just said I would pay, but made my feelings known that this is awful customer service and has forever tainted my view of the restaurant.  As I've sat in the restaurant typing this review, about 15 minutes later the manager came over, stating that she \"spoke to the owner\" and wanted to offer my friend and me $5 gift cards each for our inconvenience (fyi, our meals totaled $43, before tip). By then, the damage had already been done with how this was initially handled. And to top it off, the smoked pork chops weren't necessarily that great, and the dressing that came with it was a little dry. Probably none of this would have happened if I ordered what I would normally get at Merts (catfish), but in any event I will no longer frequent there. I don't know of anyone who goes to a restaurant to pay full money to watch table after table subsequently come in and get their food before you.",

A very very good authentic soul food restaurant in the heart of Charlotte's uptown area.  When you walk in you know you have hit the soul food jackpot by not only the aromatic fragrance of the food, but visually seeing the pitchers of homemade lemonade and ice tea throughout the establishment, the chef in the open view kitchen working on the next best meal.....YOURS! Just reminds you of grand ma's kitchen on early Sunday afternoons.  Now to the food; there was much to choose from but I decided on the fried jumbo( and they were) wings, black eye peas, and an excellent cabbage. My wife enjoyed the sampler with salmon cake, truly delicious baked mac and cheese, and a (soul roll)egg roll with diced chicken, collards,onions, black eye peas, rice and served with a spicy honey mustard sauce. DELISH.   The service was great, the staff very accommodating, There are many other dishes to try, I guess I'll have to go back a few more times! I can't wait.",

Fried chicken was moist, mashed potatoes were lumpy in a good way and the collard greens were seasoned to perfection. The cornbread was hands down the best I've ever had.

The salmon cakes were amazing, and the remoulade sauce somehow succeeded to make them better. The cornbread was way better than I expected. It wasn't gritty, was hot, light, caky. Everything u want from cornbread. The fried chicken was so good I searched like an archaeologist looking for artifacts, desperately looking for more morsels of goodness. Or maybe I was a barbarian eating bones as well as chicken, indiscriminately. Potatoes were great, Mac n cheese was great, yams great, red beans great. Collard greens weren't for my party, though. Additionally, the service was respectful and helpful. Informed us that the street side parking only lasted until 4.  Overall, I would call this a must-eat for anyone in Charlotte.",

Mert's came recommended, but I wasn't going to go out of my way. As luck would have it, as soon as I started to get seriously hungry, I realized Mert's was two blocks away.   There were some seats outside, but I wanted to cool off a little, so I got a seat by the front window. That's when I realized that this place was featured on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives. A definite win for sure!  Brittney waited my table and helped with suggestions. I debated between omelets and the Soul Sampler. I chose the latter, because \"When in Rome...\" The food came out so quickly, I said, \"How did you do that? It must be magic!\" The food was all perfect and delicious. I wouldn't have imagined the Soul Roll (egg roll stuffed with rice and beans, covered in honey mustard) would be one of my favorite foods ever, but it is seriously so good.   I would not hesitate to recommend Mert's as the one place you HAVE to eat at.",

The service was fast and courteous. They had lots of vegetarian options and the breakfast options add meat as an add on not included. That's great for our three vegetarians (my two daughters and myself) cause usually we pay for meat we never see and would never eat. There was a celebrity wall near our table with signed photos and play posters signed by the cast. The girls ordered an egg combo, one over medium the other over easy. My husband ordered the egg combo with city ham and I ordered the sweet potato pancakes. Everything was very good and everyone loved their food. They offer organic sugar for coffee and tea. The butter was honey butter which was yummy. They don't offer French fried but do offer home fries. They were good but the ketchup brand they use wasn't very tasty.",

Mert's Soul Food restaurant in Charlotte, NC is a must visit if you find yourself here for whatever reason. I been to many so called soul food establishment, some better then other... however the depth of the menu, the made from scratch dishes and last but not lease the great service and friendly wait staff is unmatched, everything came to the table fresh, hot and quick. My wife and I enjoyed it so much after we ate... we ordered takeout. Ok, the Soul Food Sampler consists of Salmon Cakes, Two Whole Wings, Soul Food Rolls (stuffed with chicken, collard greens and black eyed peas) DELICIOUS! For our takeout we ordered Beef Ribs and Fried Chicken. Oh, another must try is their signature Corn Bread DELICIOUS! Did I mention everything was brought to the table hot and in a timely manner. Lastly, Kudos to the staff for a job well done, they had a packed house and handle it like professional. I would highly recommend Mert's to family and friends.",

The greens tasted as if there were NO SEASONING at all & I don't know what was up with those big onions. I love onions, but nah. I didn't like it. The Mac n cheese was dry & as you can see in the pics, the portion was stingy.  It kind of reminded me of the Mac n cheese that's made in bulk with powder- no thanks.   The salmon cakes were decent, but let's address these wings. Now the wings...were good! They had the right amount of crispy ness & grease LOL! I enjoyed that more than anything else I ordered that evening.",

I immediately thought \"oh boy\" what I get myself into.   If I would describe Low Country it's stick-to-your-ribs comfort food from grits, fried seafood, fried chicken, etc. Everything I tried was great (fried chicken wing and soul roll were out of this world)! And they were serving it very quickly.  Our server Jerry was sent from the Gods. He knew the menu up and down, let us know the top choices by visitors and when my gf explained how she didn't like the chopped bbq he took it off our bill. I never seen service with so much attention to detail. Jerry you're the man!  The only thing that stopped me from giving a 5 star is the fried whiting had bones.",

Since it's not fresh the food was luke warm and not hot. Considering stuff like Mac and cheese and making it correctly it is somewhat understandable. The winners on the menu is the cornbread and the soul roll. What needs to improve is the flavor of the fried chicken and the banana pudding. Sprinkling the wafers is cute but not a traditional banana pudding. The sweet potato cake was meh.  Overall it wasn't bad but their is room to improve.  I would like to give them a 4 but I have to be honest.",

Food was great - I ordered a combo with fried catfish and beef bbq ribs, along with a side of MAC n cheese and okra and tomatoes. The meal came with warm cornbread and butter, probably the best thing I've had in a while. I also ordered a Tiger Woods (their version of an Arnold Palmer, half and half sweet tea lemonade), which was really fresh!   Their fried catfish and sides were good! However, the beef ribs were just okay, a little on the dry side and didn't come off bone well. Otherwise had a great experience!",

We went in and was seated and greeted right away. Our waitress was Deandray or something like that but he was pretty cool. Our food did not take very long to come once we ordered. I ordered the fries whiting which was just okay. Not seasoned that great. The collard greens: I asked them to hold the onions and tomatoes that they put on top. The macaroni and cheese: decent but not great. The cornbread was also decent but not great. I think everything just needed more seasoning. I was not wowed. My meal was about $15 I think. I would eat here again but only if I'm in the area. I also posted my friends' melas. They said it was decent also.",

Don't get me wrong the food wasn't disgusting (well the salmon was. It tasted like metal), but it was just food. We tried the soul sampler, salmon plate with okra and tomatoes, mac and cheese, and collard greens. My family ordered the salmon cakes with Mac and cheese and collard greens, the veggie plate with Mac and cheese, collards, and string beans, Salmon cake plate with seasoned rice and cabbage, and a chicken tender plate with Mac and cheese and collard greens. Everyone agreed the food was bland. The only thing I actually enjoyed was the jumbo chicken wings...they were well seasoned and fried just right! My family said the cornbread was delicious! Oh yeah, my aunt said her seasoned rice and cabbage were delicious! I would give them a 2, but my aunt swore her sides were delicious, so I'll say a 3!  It's possible we caught them on a bad day, but I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "I was actually one of the few people in Uptown on the day after Thanksgiving working.  I was walking around at lunch time and actually had no plans of eating out as I had brought my lunch from home.  Their outside sign caught my attention with wanting to give them a try!  I ordered the daily special to go as I decided my husband and I could split it for dinner.  The daily special was fried turkey with stuffing, two sides, and cornbread.  I decided to go with one of their daily sides - creamed corn, as well as, mac and cheese.  I love a great mac and cheese and wanted to try theirs.  Every part of the meal was very good!  The turkey was well done, the stuffing was good along with the gravy, the creamed corn was not traditional but still good, and the mac and cheese was also good - probably a traditional southern style - I would have preferred a more creamy/cheesier mac and cheese, definitely not my favorite restaurant mac and cheese! The cornbread was just okay to me.  Make sure you check your meals out before you leave as I had an item missing.  I called the restaurant when I returned to work and they had the side ready to go when I came back to pick it up.  I would have given them four stars if it weren't for this inconvenience, on a relatively slow day for them.  I do however, love the fact that they put the sides in separate small containers within the larger to go container.",

    "text": "Three Stars because:  1.) Fried Chicken needs seasoning. It was breaded and cooked very well! However, the Texas Pete hot sauce and some sauce from my ribs made it edible.  2.) Banana pudding serving to go was a joke. I wasn't able to take a pic of that but I believe someone else on here also stated the dessert portion. I would rather dine with dessert to see how much you get. If they were running out, I would have liked for them to just tell me that instead of serving me about 6 bites. Really wish I took a pic   3.)The ribs were so fatty. I really don't mind a little fat but there was not enough meat on them for me. I wouldn't serve someone a bone wrapped with fat at home so I'm surprised they would do that at a restaurant...  *clasps hands together* ok! So now that we've gotten that out of the way, here we go! Upon arrival we were quickly seated and asked for drink orders. I ordered a sweet tea and my bf got lemonade. You guys, these drinks were fresh AF! I know in my heart that together they'd make an awesome Arnold Palmer.   Shortly after we ordered our food, cornbread came rolling right out. Nice and warm too! I have to agree with everyone on here, their cornbread is the bomb. The food came out and the portions were awesome! I had to take a pic. Collard greens was my fave on the plate. Rice was meh. Fried chicken meh. Ribs too fatty. Sauce is really nice though. I was hungry so I devoured almost everything. Except for one rib and some of the chicken. Gross Alert: I did chew some of the ribs and spat it out. Waaayy too fatty.   My bf ordered the ribs with candied yams and Mac and cheese. He swallowed his food. I had to actually swap one of my ribs for his because his had a little bit more meat. Just a little...   Service was A1. She was on top of refills and super tentative!   Although I gave it 3 stars I would come back here. I just won't go with the fried chicken and ribs. Pass on that for sure. If the second time is no good too, then that's that !",

The Collard Greens are the toughest and tasteless greens I've ever had and the Mac & Cheese is so so.

I have to say that the corn bread was absolutely amazing, which makes no sense that the rest of the food was so unappetizing.",

    "text": "Brief summary of our experience.  Service sucked ass big time!!  If it was purely based on service alone, it would have gotten a 1 star or 0 stars!!!  If review was based on food alone, it would have gotten 4 stars.  I decided to compromise and give them 3 stars.    Our sour dining experience starts and ends with Sharon, our waitress.  Bottom line, she was very rude and she needs to be FIRED!!!  After we were seated, took about 5 minutes before she approached our table.  She then gave us 2 straws and did not even bother to greet us or introduce herself to us.  Then she turned her back to us before we could say anything and continued to flirt with the 2 guys in the table to the right of us.  We didn't even get a chance to ask for water.  About another 5 minutes goes by and finally we can order.  She takes our orders but throughout the entire time, we did not have her full attention, her mind was at that table!  After our orders were placed, we got our cornbread BUT she did not give us ANY utensils to eat it with.  I asked another waitress for utensils and she said she would get it for us, but she never did.  Basically, we weren't her table so she didn't want to help Sharon out.  I guess no camaraderie at this workplace.  In the meantime while we were waiting for our utensils, a party of 2 sat to the table to the left of us and they encountered the same issues with her.  They too were served their salad and cornbread without utensils.  We all had to wait at least 5 minutes if not more.  The only good thing about waiting was the table with the 2 guys to the right of us paid and left.  Now I thought she could focus more on us.  I was wrong!!    She brings us our main dishes, fried chicken quarter and fried catfish with our sides being, mac & cheese, yams, okra with tomatoes, and collard greens.  We also ordered an appetizer and I couldn't believe our main dishes came BEFORE the appetizer.  In the end, we just took the appetizer off the bill because we finished out main courses and the appetizer never came in the interim.  Anyways, we STILL did not have our utensils.  I was pissed!!  We waited anywhere between 5-10 minutes before our utensils finally arrived.  By that time, out food was somewhat cold.  We ate our food ASAP and got the hell out of there!!  If you ever come here, don't get waited by her.  Another thing that irked me, a part of 3 ladies sat in the table to the right of us and she was definitely more friendly to them.  I won't speculate about anything but bottom line, she is a terrible waitress (definitely the bottom tier).  As for the food.  LOVED the fried chicken.  Batter wasn't thick at all.  Light and crispy and chicken was moist and tender.  The fried catfish was good as well.  Lightly battered and fried.  As for the sides, I personally do not like tomatoes and onions with my collard greens.  I prefer the smoke flavored ham collard greens.  If you like the sour/tart collar greens, then this is a place where you can get them.  The candid yams were good, but definitely not the best.  I couldn't put my taste buds on it, but the sugar they use is a little different and it doesn't seem that they used a lot of butter.  The mac & cheese was just okay, I prefer more than once type of cheese in my mac & cheese =P  (i'm just spoiled)  As for the food, I would recommend this place and I would come here again.  When we paid for our bill at the cashier's desk, that lady even knew that we received sub-par service.  She made some jokes to make us feel better about our dining experience.  I applaud her effort but what she needs to do is get rid of that waitress.",

    "text": "Heard from friends it was just ok, but was hungerin for soul food and wanted to decide for myself.   Ordered quarter leg chicken with catfish, sides of collard greens and mac & cheese. Chicken was cooked through but the meat made me think they'd gotten it from a mass market supplier, yet and still no compliants on the taste. Mac & cheese was AweSoMe. Didn't have that stretch-cheese consistensy, more crumblike, no complaints here either. Greens can be made a few different ways, this way wasn't my fave but they weren't nasty, a lil on the tart side but the red onions helped to cut through the taste.  After an absence from seafood for years, I wanted to get back in the ring and decided to try catfish for the first time. This was really good. It was breaded well, seasoned too, and not greasy (neither was the chicken). I like the sauce they give even though it probably just mayo & some other type of dressing mixed together.   Guy who took my order said the cornbread was on the small side so he gave me two. No recession in this order woohoo! Butter was nice and creamy, cornbread was one of the best I've ever had.  When traveling to, look for the big \"EAT\" sign seen in the pics. The Mert's sign isn't as easy to pinpoint especially while driving. And when you walk in, if it's anything like my visit, expect to see smiles and people ready to serve you.",

We put our bones on a plate on the table next to us in an effort to divert them.   The food is still really good, and we appreciate the friendly service but it is a bit slow. As others have mentioned, the macaroni and cheese is quite yummy. I had blackened pork chops this time and they were well-seasoned but a tad bit dry.

The waitress rarely came back to the table.  I ordered a side of collard greens with no tomatos and onions on top.  The waitress forgot the collards, and when I reminded her, she brought it out cold and with the toppings.  Soo if you just want the great food, and are not too concerned about the service, then give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!",

Husband had the fried chicken and I had the blackened salmon.  Sides were okra and tomatoes, rice and steamed cabbage, which my husband raved about (he cleaned the bowl before even trying anything else).  The sweet tea and amazing cornbread recipes could only come from someone fortunate enough to be born in the south-would of made my grandmother proud.  The only thing better than the food (if that's possible) is the service.  From hostess to waitress (Darlene), it was the definition of southern hospitality.  You will miss out if you don't try this place!",

She first suggested  the salmon cakes which were amazing with the side sauce. This is a MUST get if your trying something out there for the first time.  Add a sweet tea to it as well! Cannot go wrong with that!  Then she suggested the sweet potato pie, which was AMAZING!!! It was so fluffy and tasty! And it was a nice portion as well!  Then I went back later for my second dinner and I got the shrimp and grits, which was a southern classic and that was very good as well! I cannot complain, the service was amazing, they took care or me there and they really are very kind and nice to you!  They make you feel like family there and they all are very generous. Portions are great and food is AMAZING!!! Definitely eat here if your in the neighborhood!",

I had to drown it in hot sauce for it to taste like anything. The fried green tomatoes were soggy and average. The star of my meal was the cabbage surprisingly.  The service was great.

But oh how good was the food the corn bread and catfish were to die for but the best thing for me was the good buttered fried cabbage something that makes my mouth water as I think about them. One last thing the server hostess and even kitchen workers made time to speak this was a Top Notch surprise for such a quaint place thanks Chandra you took great care of us!

The beef ribs and pulled pork melt in your mouth delicious with an outstanding tomato and vinegar based sauce. Sides of okra, collards, Mac & cheese paired well. The sampler platter was very unique for a BBQ joint and is a must to try if your are willing to try something new. The Corn bread and sweet butter was a great compliment to the meet.   It's half the price of Roosters up the street and you will not leave hungry.  The very next day we were craving for more.",

I usually get the fried chicken tenders but opted for the barbecue ribs last time I was here, and was not disappointed. The cornbread is a huge plus but is usually too much for me to finish. Shrimp and Grits is an all-time favorite for me as well. If you can, save room for dessert. If they have it, the german chocolate cake is a total win.

Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Service was excellent.",

    "text": "Well smack the dentures right out of your southern grandma's mouth! Just like a old time Sunday dinner in the Deep South! As your ears are filled with music of the soul, R&B, and blues varieties; once your server sets the plate of cornbread loafs on your table, you know you're in for a treat! Yes, cornbread loafs that are sweet and when smothered with the accompanying butter, absolutely delicious! We ordered the salmon patties with Mac n Cheese and green beans! This is not salmon from a can, instead fresh poached salmon that are extremely tasty! The Mac n Cheese was probably baked before serving, and without question the best I've had at a restaurant! The green beans were cooked, no doubt, in some kind of bacon grease presumably. We also had a combination plate of the bbq beef ribs with a fried chicken breast! I'm not a fan of beef ribs, but these were tender and not overpowered by the bbq sauce! The fried chicken was, well, southern fried chicken at its finest! We also tried the candied yams which were cooked perfectly without being too sweet from the brown sugar. The place makes you feel as though your in a diner in Harlem; with the decor and old time soul music blending with the aromas of fresh southern roots! The servers could be a little more attentive, however our redeemed himself after seeing us stop another waitress to ask for refills. I will say that each employee was personable, hospitable, and eager when asked to give you their take on the food and history of this popular spot in downtown Charlotte. As I paid and walked out the door,  passing a street performer doing her best Etta James impersonation, I realized that outside of Harlem you just don't find many places like Mert's! Starting another diet, this Southern Gentleman just had a great meal!",

When we arrived we could see the place was crowded but were seated within a few minutes.  We ordered the Fried Green Tomato since we never had it before and it was very good.  We also tried the Soul Rolls which were also good.  For my daily fixins I ordered the Fried Cat Fish while my girlfriend had Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes.  We were happy with our food including the sides of macaroni & cheese, okra, mashed potatoes, and collard greens.  We also tried a slice of coconut cake.  The only thing we didn't like was that the restaurant seemed a bit dirty.  Overall, we really liked the food here and would recommend it to anyone looking for quality soul food.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my experience at Mert's. Having a soul food restaurant in Uptown really shows the variety of options. Again, with friends we visited and the place was packed. It's not the largest restaurant, but it has lots of charm. The place had photos all over the wall and some interesting art too. I was mostly taken by the counter of cakes. They had at least 10 on the counter for you to choose from. I picked out the cake I wanted before I ordered my food. I had the fried catfish, black eyed peas, cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. I enjoyed everything except the macaroni and cheese. I also had cornbread, which was great. I had to stop eating it before my food came out or I would have been full. Ok, the best part of it all was the Banana Pudding Cake. Initially, I wanted the Banana Pudding, but they were out, so the next best thing is Banana Pudding Cake. It was highly recommended from our waitress and it didn't disappoint. It's a must try. All the cakes looked delicious. The food is reasonably priced too. The restaurant is in the city, so parking is available in different lots or garages and you can walk. Overall, I enjoyed it!",

Even if you're in town for an extended stay, Mert's should fall on your radar within in the first few days.   Where I'm not a huge soul/comfort food goer on the regular, the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac n' cheese and other sides have all sang beautifully upon my many visits. One thing that sticks out more frequently and consistently beckons my palate is the lemonade. Goodness gracious, it's that good. Sometimes, I think of stopping in just for a big glass to go.   One thing to keep in mind about Mert's is that it functions quite differently than other Uptown culinary hearths. This place is busy throughout the week and the weekends. Not uncommon for them to be on a wait well into a Sunday afternoon. Plan accordingly, should you find yourself visiting during any \"peak\" hour.   Service is ever-so friendly and I love the \"shoe art(?)\" in the men's bathroom. Kind of odd, but definitely worth a gander if you've never seen it.   Mert's, thank you. Just...for everything.",

I haven't been to Mert's in a couple of years but ventured in this past wk and it was just as good as I remembered it .   Solid place for a down home lunch and the prices are pretty cheap. I used to get their pulled pork but this last time I saw the server bring out their BLT to another table and food envy hit immediately! Never would I order a BLT at a restaurant but when you put the BLT on a focaccia bread, I am all over that bad boy. Pair that up with the mac n cheese and I could only finish half of my sandwich and walked out with a tab less than $7. Next time I'll be saving room for their red velvet cake or banana cream pudding-totally worth clogging my arteries over!",

I wouldn't have needed it but everything needed a bit of something.  This is really a 3 1/2 star place for me.

We loved the quirky decor and immediately felt the warm fuzzies for our energetic waitress. We were there for breakfast, but I personally was excited to hear that there were meat and veggies choices available too. Good flavored coffee was a welcome beginning , as was the yummy cornbread and crunchy biscuits. 5 stars would have been given , but some in our party said their omelette choices were just ok. My non traditional meal of salmon patties, collard greens and home fries was yummy!  Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I look forward to a return to this place.  Egg rolls filled with collards and black eyed peas and roasted veggies are on my list of things to try next time.  Gourmet soul food at its best!",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying, I cook and cook well.  My family is from down south originally, and the family side from the midwest can cook.  So I'm biased when it comes to 'soul food' or 'southern food.'  Being in Charlotte from LA, my expectations aren't super high for soul food, seeing as though all we have is Roscoe's out there, which is average, but still the only 'go to' spot when you want soul food that you didn't prepare.   The girl at the register, was SUPER nice.  She answered my questions, and had some spunk and personality to her.  Call me weird, but bad attitudes and customer service don't go together.  So she was a pleasant surprise, especially considering 2 other ladies seemed to throw a couple dirty looks my way versus asking me if I had been helped.    Ended up ordering take out:  Got the fried chicken wings with 2 sides. Mac & cheese and collard greens.  Also ordered the salmon cakes appetizer (b/c of the raving yelp reviews) And the banana pudding.   Wings were just ok.  I'd give them 2.5 stars.  Not much flavor.  But if you don't know much about frying chicken, I could see how this place would be great for you to get your fix.   Salmon cakes: TERRIBLE.  The sauce that comes on the side was good, but they just didn't do it for me.  I took 3 bites and tossed them. 1 star.  Mac & Cheese: GREAT! 5 stars.  Should have just ordered a tub of that lol.   Greens: blah.  Too vinegary and bland.  I'm a greens snob.  So these were super below par for me.  1.5 stars  Banana pudding:  4 stars.  Pretty tasty.  Even though I just ate the bites where I could find some vanilla cookie and then once that was gone, tossed the rest.    Overall it was ok.  I'm going to try the other place later next week, called 'king's kitchen?' and see if they are any better.",

The catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet). The yams were out of a can so that was a major let down. The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.  Seems like a tourist spot to me. The staff was friendly and I liked the crowd I didn't get a chance to try the homemade cakes although they looked pretty tasty.  I can at least say that I tried this place :)",

For dinner, I had the salmon cakes on one occasion and the fried catfish on the other.  On the side, I had yams and greens and a sweet tea to wash it all down.  I managed to save enough room for dessert and enjoyed a slice of sweet potato cake.  The cake was moist and delicious and the frosting was nothing short of decadent.  Merts portions are huge.

I love the fried chix, green beans and collards  and cabbage -- occasionally the collards need to be prepped a little better to get  all the grit out, though.  servers  are nice and will get you out if you are in a bit of a hurry .I recommend Merts for some for good, hearty Southern cooking!",

    "text": "So very busy at 8pm on Sunday.   Came to Charlotte while on vacation and it was on my route.  Parked at the Hearst Media Towers and just went walking.  I saw Mert's and looked up on Yelp and the reviews got me in.  Now, let's be clear on this.  This location is in a nice building, next to a nice Holiday Inn; so don't expect fancy NOTHING.    The inside looks very well broken in but yet clean and eclectic. Iron metal art sculptures with wood adorn the inside, the kitchen area is open and you can see everything.  There was only two guys back there and may GOD bless them both, they were rockin out some GREAT FLAVOR.    I was promptly seated then greeted by my server whom said she would be right back to take my order.  As I said this place was busy so I figured I would be waiting on my food.  NOT THE CASE.   As with most places I visit first I say to the servers \"Please bring me food.  Your choice, Your call.  Don't tell me.\"  Then I list what I don't eat.  I also asked for sweet tea.     Understanding that this is soul food, real soul food.  So I was excited.  The tea came, glass was clean.  The tea.  Well, the first glass went down fast and was refilled quickly by my server with a smile.    Within a few minutes my food was delivered by another server.  Fried Chicken, green beans, and mac & cheese, with cornbread.  I'm happy.     The green beans had great flavor, very nicely cooked.  The mac & cheese is incredible, was tempted to order a side bowl of this but, hey, already ate like 4 times prior.  I picked the chicken up, white meat; and tried to bite into it.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!      I warn you, wait for 20 to 30 minutes till you can get into this.  HOW THE HECK IS IT SO HOT FOR SO LONG?  Darn..  I had to cut into it with a knife to let the heat out.  Once it was safe to eat it, I was first taken to the memory of my mothers and grandma's chicken that was made at home.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy, but just pure flavor and moist.  I finished off several more glasses of that great sweet tea and cleaned my plate.     Total bill was about $11, I forgot to keep the receipt, but was well worth it and the server was taken very good care of.     She offered cake for desert but it was HUGE, no way I could have eaten that and still be functional to see the town that night.        Only downside to this place is that it is right off the street, so you get noise from the traffic and flies find their way in.  No biggie, they did not eat much.        So if you live within a couple of hours, this place rocks.  Service is great.   Happy Eating...",

    "text": "I came to Charlotte on a mini vacation for a week. People around the area were raving about this place called Mert's.  I decided to check out this place for dinner. When I walked in, I felt like I was at home.   Everything felt laid back and homey. I didn't know what to order so I decided to ask the waitress. She gave me a couple recommendations and I decided to go with the combo which came with BBQ Beef Rib, Fried Chicken, and two sides. I ordered the Mac & Cheese and home fries. Blue Moon was only $3.50 so we decided to grab couple beers.  While we waited for our food our waitress came to our table with some corn bread and sweet butter. This is probably the best cornbread I ever had!!! It was sweet and delicious!!! When my food came the Fried Chicken looked dry and not very appealing. I bite into the chicken and was amazed! The chicken was juicy, tender, and not that greasy! The beef ribs were just as satisfying!  The mac & cheese and mash potatoes were both great.   I would definitely recommend this place. The atmosphere was relaxing and I felt like I was at home. Waitress provided excellent service and was conversing with us throughout the night. Lastly, the combo with the two sides cost me $14! If you are near downtown Charlotte, you must check this place out and order the FRIED CHICKEN & BBQ RIBS!",

Not to mention was pretty cheap. I normally don't know cornbread but here it's awesome! Just a little sweetness to it. We also got the fried green tomatoes, I liked them because I prefer restaurants that use cornmeal and they did, I suggest to ask for some extra sauce they drizzle on top. If it friend chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy and Mac and cheese. Overall pretty standard soul food, to be honest it was good but wasn't the best I've ever had for all three items. The chicken was a large portion and the gravy could have used a little more flavor. Overall pretty good for a quick bite to eat.",

The inside was dark and had an old feeling to it. Typical t shirt and jeans kinda place. Ladies, do not get dolled up to come here. You will not be noticed. Not only will the darkness overshadow you, your partners will also be distracted by the amazing food to even care about your existence at that moment.   Fried chicken: outside was crispy and perfect. Just enough grease on it to leave a shimmer on your fingers. Cooked perfectly. A little tug to it. The only way this could have been better was to add some lawry's to it before coating it.   Collard greens: idc what race or ethnicity u are, you will love it. Not too wet. Just enough taste of ham hocks in there. Yea. Good.   Okra tomato think: looked diarrhea in the bowl. Tasted like heaven. I wasn't expecting that flavor to come out of this, but it hits u like heroine.  U keep wanting more.   Mac and cheese: fuck yea. 2nd best I've ever had in my life. (Smoque in Chicago has it barely beat)  The cornbread: THE BEST CORNBREAD I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!! I won't even tell u why. Go figure it out yourself.   Bottom line: you want good southern soul food that I would stereotypically assume what soul food is, go here. It's that damn good.",

Jumbo wings: You get three with the meal. Fried perfectly. Delicious. Delicious. Delicious.  Mac & Cheese: I can't seem to find decent mac & cheese out west so I wait until I come back East to get my fix. This mac & cheese was all things perfect! Two thumbs up.  Collard greens: This was my least favorite dish. While I appreciated that they weren't overlooked, they were really vinegary. I wasn't a fan.  Sweet potato cake: I had never heard of such a delicacy. I figured since I love sweet potatoes and I'm a fan of cake, this would hit the spot! I think it needed more butter though as it was really dry.  Overall, a must visit place when you're in Charlotte!",

I asked how long will my food take she said it would \"be ready when I arrived\" usually I get an estimate so it pretty much seemed as though she wanted to keep her answers short and abrupt. She also tried to over talk me when I asked the question and answer by interrupting me. It seems as though she did not want my business and I gave her what she wanted.

    "text": "Living downtown for over 6 years my family and friends have dined here very often. The food is good, prices very reasonable. I consciously support local businesses. Last night my husband and I decided to call in an order at 8:40 we were told 15 min we didn't arrive to pick up food until 9:00pm. I walked in and stood at front desk for at least 10 min BEFORE ANYONE ACKNOWLEDGED I saw waitress hurrying pass helping customers etc.I waited eventually a server in a purple shirt not sure if different colors represent positions comes over I tell her the name she looks around goes and gets my food from kitchen I check bag everything was there she takes bag back places on table behind cash register then walks away . I'm standing there confused another server notices me comes over ask do I need any help and I'm like yes I want to check out and for the inconvenience of me standing for now 15 min for a slice of cake he obliged as he returned with A SLICE of cake purple shirt hurries says\"what you think your doing ,he says some words pretty low she Snatches cake and says did you ask kiona. I'm like umm is kiona manager. purple shirt leaves now I'm livid, embarrassed still hungry etc.A server comes over in red shirt ask how can she help I explain I've been standing here for 20 min I called in my order over 35 min ago she Goes through my bag  again. Now I'm feeling upset why is everyone checking the food .She says the reason it took so long is because A MANAGER TOOK MY PHONE ORDER AND ONLY SHE CAN CHECK ME OUT AND SHE IS BUSY WHAT are you serious but she has PERMISSION to do so now. I couldn't understand the protocol. Why answer phone .This was upsurd. I said can you ask the manager for a slice of cake. NOT FREE DINNERS she comes back and says mysterious manager said NO if she gave me a slice everyone would need one .As a business owner I understand that my clients need to feel heard, appreciated and respected a $4 slice WAS THIS SERIOUS .MY husband came in because it was now close yup 30 min of me walking into the place. He also owns a business in Charlotte and has brought many clients to Merts he told me he no longer wanted to pay for the meal that we will patronage another business in which we did and called in , food was ready, we were greeted with respect. THANKS \"Dish\". If Merts can't handle busy hours, understaffed etc.IT IS NEVER THE CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBILTY. Disappointed that I can no longer support a rude establishment. My time and money are valuable and not to be treated any differently. The young guy with light braids should be a manager he knows how to calmly find solutions however he didn't have control over this situation and neither did I.",

The chicken was good, not spectacular, but decent and juicy... chicken is the only reason for the 2 stars. The wings are not jumbo. Mac and cheese is dry/not cheesy. Black eyed peas weren't seasoned and lacked flavor. Yams were decent. Cabbage undercooked and also under seasoned. And the greens were cooked well not too soggy or mushy but taste like vinegar. The peach CAKE not cobbler was the most disappointing. Almost 5 bucks for a hunk of cake with a handful of tiny ground up CANNED peaches (see photo). They should not in any way describe it as a cobbler and could at least use frozen peaches instead of canned. We almost feel like driving back just to give them this box of peach dough and get our $5 back!! Don't believe the hype!",

BUT the cornbread tastes just like my grandma's (which is heavenly) and the Mac & cheese is pretty great. My boyfriend got fried chicken tenders which were more flavorful than the fried chicken wings. The soul roll appetizers were tasty too. Although service was quick, our server was also a bit on the attitude-y side. She answered questions snarkly, talked to us while walking away, and barely responded to questions to make sure she heard me. She then made a comment about her tip which would have been more if she had not had such an unfit mood. I'd definitely go back but only in the hopes of a more pleasant server!",

    "text": "I am a new resident to the City of Charlotte. In search of some where to have dinner in the uptown area, to celebrate my friends Birthday, we came across this quant  place. bypassing 5star gourmet restaurants we opted to have  a quite dinner with some soul food. The restaurant was interestingly decorated  and the menu was appetizing.  The service on the other hand was not.  I had never tried shrimp and grits before  so I being a special occasion I decided to try something new. when the dish came to the table the presentation was nice however the taste was not satisfactory. it was overloaded with onion and It was not enjoyable to me. So I then asked the waitress if something could be done because I didn't like  the dish. She told me \"I have to get the manager, because I can't change once the food is on the table.\"  I told her that was fine. The manager never came to offer any apologies nor explain what the solution could be. the waitress comes back after like 15mn and says \"She says pick something of the menu and we'll trade it out.\" I then chose the chicken dinner. The waitress nor the food did not come back for almost another 20mn. she then comes to the table not to refill drinks or to apologize for the wait. but to offer to bag up the meal and bring the check. at this point I was embarrassed for bringing my friend to this place and irritated because I was hungry and very annoyed with the service I told her yes please bring the check. she brings a check not only with the meal I changed for but also the initial meal that I did not eat. I was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress. that waitress says sure she's the lady over there in the red shirt.  and walks the other way.  So I then call the manager over to clarify that this was a mistake. she says \"If the owner was here he would not be playing with y'all. He would make you pay for both. I on the other hand will take it off.\" I was floored at the way she spoke to me and the fact that the owner would make a patron pay for something they didn't like. I felt stereo typed and embarrassed that it was my people to treat us this way. So needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever! I hope this is not hospitality in Charlotte.",

I understand that it's southern home cooking, however other items on the menu warn that it's spicy.  I understand it's not a four star restaurant, however the batter on the popcorn shrimp could have more crispy.  Perhaps the fryer was not to temperature when they sunk them.  Despite the spiciness of the potatoes they where fresh and not cooked that long, although personally I do like crispy home fries.  Having said that portion was good size, price average with other restaurants in the area.  Service was my biggest issue.  While the waitress did keep checking back to see if we where ready to order, however she never asked if I would like another Ice Tea.  I needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention.",

However, the past 3 times we have gone recently, something has been either wrong or uncooked, and it just leaves us speechless in what has become of Mert's. The customer service is lacking horribly, service is sllooowww, chicken has been under-cooked two times now out of our 3 recent visits, and the list goes on. All these downs have swayed us away from Mert's now unfortunately. Every time we want to grab something soulful to eat, we think of Mert's....then remember what has happened the last three consecutive times....and then we back out and chose elsewhere. Truly unfortunate, but I would rather not risk spending $30+ to have uncooked food or feel as though we do not even exist in a restaurant that should be serving us, taking our orders, refilling our drinks without us wondering around to find someone to do so :( Really hoping for the best and that the management there straightens up and get this place in shape again.",

Let me add that I almost slipped in my heels walking in and out because the floor wad so greasy and covered with food. Oh let me not forget the salty peach cobbler that looked like someone laid a piece of bread on top for the crust. The peaches weren't even sweet. I'm sorry, someone told be I'd feel like i was eating at my grandma's kitchen.  On her worst day her cooking never tasted this bad. If i had to describe this place in one word \"Yuck\" would be it. I went on a Sunday.  Maybe they have better cooks through the week, but by reading some of the reviews I doubt it.",

    "text": "Looking for a brunch spot before heading to the airport in Charlotte, my husband and I chose Mert's because of the reviews we read.  And it was a great find!    This place has character, from the portraits and decor, to the bathrooms to the staff.  Tthe service was great - we were visisted by at least 4 different staff members, but it was seamless.  The food also had character - I had the red beans and rice with smoked turkey.  It was just alright.  But if that was the low point of the meal, I will take it!  After reading the reviews, we had to try the sweetpotato pancakes.  WOW - they were definitely worthy of the praise!  The homefriends were also delish.  My husband had the biscuits and gravy and was fat and happy with his choice.   I am not sure that this restaurant is worth a trip back to Charlotte on its own, but we will definitely be back if we are in the area!  There are so many more things on the menu to try!!",

Since I feel that my entree was only a bit above average I'd rate this 3 stars.  For a soul food place this I would definitely come back for the salmon cake and cornbread.  I enjoyed my food and the portions. The waitstaff was helpful and very friendly.  It was an overall pleasant place to have dinner.",

I visit every few months for their awesome beef ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens (I'm a collard fanatic, and these may be my favorite anywhere - and they are veg!). Lots of other good stuff on the menu as well - Soul Rolls, Chicken Tenders, Salmon Cakes, to name a few - but the ribs are hard to pass up. What really puts my love for Mert's over the top though is the ownership and the consistently good service. Last night, we visited, and although both Mother's Day and JCSU graduation meant they were packed, we were seated quickly, served promptly, and left happy. It was not the only time we have been impressed with the friendliness of everyone at Mert's!",

    "text": "Last year I remembered that this place had a line out the door. We waited last year and we waited this year too. Why? Because Mert's is worth it!   We were lined up outside for about 20 minutes this time, but found entertainment in a street hustle, where some character asks to see if you have a 100 dollar bill and if so he invites you to bet it by guessing which of 3 bottle caps has a red pill underneath. I was so glad to get in when we did, really not trying to get caught up in a street brawl just in case both that red pill and main man's 100 dollar bill disappeared all at once.   So we're seated. I ordered a sweet tea, collard greens, mac n cheese, fried catfish, and BBQ beef riblets. Sounds like alot, but the portions are equivalent to a plate of food at a cook out. Nonetheless I was stuffed! The collard greens are excellent, you can taste a little vinegar and they top them with tomato and onion if you don't protest. I enjoyed everything, mac n cheese thick n cheesy, ribs-tender sauce -sweet, the catfish was good n crisp, however I like a slightly spicier batter. But other than that, two thumbs up!!   The surroundings are pleasant, you see lots of young people laughing and having fun, and proud accomplished HBCU alumni telling their stories around the table! An American dream, the culture here is so rich. This place is worthy of a visit from one of those Food Network Road Scholars for sure! Totally SATISFYING; where else can 5 grown ups eat for $80? If yall don't know you better ask somebody :0) Mert's is all that!",

I was also a big fan of the collared greens, they were the best I have ever tasted.  Mert's is an awesome spot located right in downtown Charlotte.

The chicken lacked flavor and had a hint of a freezer-burn taste, the greens were undercooked and not stemmed, the yams were too soupy and didn't have a stitch of a homemade taste. In fact, they tasted like a jazzed up canned version. All of this and then to top it off, the customer service was poor. I'm new to CLT, and read all of the Yelp reviews before dining here. Queen City, if this is as good as it gets for soul food here, that's pretty darn scary. One star for the location only.",

First time I had fried chicken and I honestly can say that Bojangles is by far better. This time I had the shrimp creole and rice and it was not bad but doesn't stand out. The rice was bland and the dish over all had no spice. If you have a party over 4 eating here, forget it because they only have seating for 4 and no good accommodations for larger parties. I had a party of 6 this time and it took OVER AN HOUR for us to be seated. I had visiting family and they tried to sit us at separate tables?? NOT GOOD ENOUGH MERTS! Now the part that any restaurant should have is good customer service and today, their host was extremely poor, rude and had a major attitude problem! This is unacceptable for ANY RESTAURANT! My recommendation is to go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble!",

I think the service here is really hit or miss though, the first time we had great service, the second time a robotic like server who was actively RUDE to us after presenting our Living Social coupon. Like a toddler throwing a tantrum rude.  I understand that a lot of people might tip less when using a living social which is the pits, but we do not (and did not tip less despite her rudeness). Tip to restaurant owners: do not have a living social if your staff is going to be rude to your new customers...   The food both times has been fantastic and the mac and cheese will keep us coming back despite the hit or miss service. We generally try to come during the week to avoid the crowds and that has worked so far for getting a table pretty quickly. Probably won't be a regular spot, but I wouldn't say that we'll never return.    So, Food: 5/5, Service 2-3/5 (depending on your server) for an average of 3/5  or 4/5 on a good night.",

There was no wait for a table. The atmosphere is very nostalgic and I loved the music. We stayed longer because of it. I ordered the chicken wings with cabbage and collards. It also came with cornbread; one of my favorite. The cabbage was a hit at the table. I liked the collards even though they did not taste like mine. That had a hint of vinegar and they were topped with chopped onions and tomatoes. They we slightly al dente but that was fine too since they had a good flavor. The meal came with three large whole wings that were seasoned and fried to perfection. Now for the cornbread. I happen to be an expert at this and I know each person has their preference. It was a mini loaf and slightly over cooked. The top should be light brown with no Blackmon the edges. It was more dense than cakey which is okay for me but it lacked flavor. Slightly sweet which is okay too. My issue was that it did not come hot. They whipped butter just sat on it when I cut it open. Overall the table enjoyed their meals and I would come again if only for the veggies.",

The first thing that greeted me when I walked in was the low sanitation score (90) the decor was dark and drab and the fruit flies kept me swatting the moment we walked in the door. As for the food. The collard greens were hard, crunchy and gritty. Quite frankly they were disgusting. They also lacked flavor. I had the Merts appetizer platter. I  noticed the chicken was not properly cooked and the soul rolls were realllly disappointing. I did not like the sweet sauce that they were coated in and they left me with a weird taste in my mouth. Salmon cakes were just ok. But after a under satisfying experience with the other food, it was hard to enjoy anything on my plate. I hope to NEVER visit this place again. If you are in search of soul food, I would look elsewhere. Kings Kitchen is a few blocks away and deliver a much better meal experience and cleaner environment.",

They actually accommodated us as well as was possible, sitting us quickly and close to the other group. One of my colleagues was a little nervous about the authenticity of a soul food restaurant in the heart of downtown. Man. Oh. Man. Do not let the location fool you. Inside it is as down home as it gets.   The food was great. I had the catfish, yams and green beans. It was a bit salty for my taste but otherwise great! The loaf of cornbread came out first and I had to stop myself from eating it like it was the meal. It was perfect. Not too sweet and not too dry. My table mates had red beans and rice and some sides and the other one had a salad and some sides. I have no idea why he had a salad at a soul food place but he was the happiest of us all about the restaurant. Crazy! Ha. We compared Mert's to other soul food places and laughed at how people are so hard on soul food places.   The place was packed and the cool thing was the crowd was pretty diverse. I think you can tell a lot about a place by the crowd that eats there. This one seemed to appeal to everyone. So I would definitely go back. The service was kind of sketchy. She was fast and it was accurate we just had to ask for things that seemed standard - like refills & to go boxes. It was super busy though. All and all It's in the top 5 of soul food places I've been to across the country. The atmosphere and the music were also pretty fun. My only regret is that I didn't try the cobbler. Oh and if you're like me you will get enough food for 2 meals. Be prepared!",

We ordered the red beans and rice, the lunch special, smoked pork chop, and the ribs appetizer. All were delicious.  We had iced tea for our beverages and peach cobbler for dessert. Samantha took care of us and is an ambassador for the establishment. She suggested we return and I said Thanksgiving time.

Mert's is definitely good.   The service was kind, warm and attentive even though it was a bit busy in there.  I ordered the Shrimp Creole dish and by no means was I disappointed. It was saucy plus spicy (those traits can't be wrong in women nor food), small shrimp goodness ladled on top of rice.  The cornbread comes before your meal and good thing I don't judge on the free food.  Just sayin'.  One thing to write home about is the COLLARD GREENS! I could eat a lasagna dish full of just their greens.  It's slightly bitter, balanced out with butter and a slight citrus taste and perfectly cooked.  You must try it!  My only complaint is the cleanliness, the place needs a little TLC especially in the corners that people (unlike me) don't typically look, or don't want to anyway. Give it a rub down.  All and all, 2 contently hard nipples for Mert's.",

BBQ Beef Ribs - really good...tasty and tender...get em Fried Chicken - pretty good, I've definitely had better, but I like the light batter Corn Bread - order extra Mac 'n Cheese - yummy crispy crust Red Beans - decent...should have tried the collard greens Salmon Cakes - surprisingly fishy...not sure if they're made with fresh or canned salmon Peach Cobbler - not good...had an off-putting under taste and smell...almost as if it was spoiled  All in all a very large and filling meal for around $25; and for the most part a pretty good one too.",

Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \"It'll be right up.\" He did not consider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times.   After I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come.   The server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.  There are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated.",

By time it got to us we were so sick of waiting and so tired since it was 11pm that we could barely eat.   The food wasn't particularly good, I ordered the chicken and macaroni with green beans. Chicken was dry, green beans under seasoned and bland. The macaroni was good, they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay. They got two orders wrong in our party of 4 though.

The beef ribs were not quite what I was expecting or really would have ordered if I had known.  They were the short kind - and in this case, emphasis on short.  There was very little meat on them. The BBQ sauce was too vinegary for my tastes, just ok.  The catfish was solid, but again, when I was eating it I still didn't understand the hype.  The collards were the best part of the meal (delicious take on a classic), and the Mac and cheese was good too, though under seasoned.   My partner had the salmon cakes, which were very good.  I don't remember what else she had, but this aspect was memorable and quite good.  We both had cake for dessert, which again were good but not outstanding.  The atmosphere is cool here. I like the bright colors and the VERY friendly and courteous wait staff.  You can tell they want their customers to be happy, but the food just wasn't that great, so I can't go above 3 stars for now.  We may try mert's again, so we'll see.",

The Shrimp Creole omelette was tasty and really filling. It was filled with shrimp and topped with a spicy tomato based sauce. Skip the OJ - it's the gross concentrate kind.

I heard a couple of great recommendations, and my family decided to try it out.   The meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. Between the four of us we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.  Then there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like...   Our server was super friendly and comfortable; she was really nice but not in the kind of way where she was trying too hard.   Love love loved it. I will look forward to coming back on each visit home!",

I ordered the catfish and was reluctant at first since they give you a whole fish and I feared getting the meat off the bones. Nothing to fear; the flesh slides so effortlessly off the bone that it was a pleasure eating it - and quite tasty with that \"special sauce.\"   Paris waited on us hand and foot. She had good suggestions from the menu and she kept our beverage glasses full. She was very friendly and a delight to have serve us.  We dined outside since there was a nice cool gentle breeze blowing. I wish the outside ambiance was nicer; maybe they can surround it with more potted trees/shrubs to block it from the street.

    "text": "As excited as I was to experience the \"best soul food in Charlotte\" I was very disappointed in my experience at Mert's. My family traveled 6 hours from Washington, D.C. To Charlotte yesterday to help a friend move and heard great things about Mert's. When we arrived we were asked to wait outside while our table was being prepared. There were 13 of us so that wasn't a surprise but the place was only half full so it seemed unnecessary. ONE HOUR LATER we checked back with the hostess who hadnt BEGUN to prepare our table because she was busy with her friends and what appeared to be her newborn baby. We were seated and enjoyed our waiter. The food was another story. My husband ordered shrimp creole and I got the fried catfish and fried leg quarter with seasoned rice and Mac and cheese. I will say that the fried catfish was smaller than expected yet delicious but I felt that EVERYTHING ELSE was terrible. The rice was well over cooked and tasted like the bottom on the pan was scraped to get rid of it and my Mac and cheese was burned. The shrimp creole tasted like shrimp covered with tomato sauce on top of the same old dry rice. Overall I really wanted my experience to be as good as others have told me but even my sister in law who recommended the place was surprised at how bad her food was. I really wish it was just a bad night but first impressions are lasting in this case.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/",

The other night, while I was watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I was pleasantly surprised when they put a spotlight on Merts. I had to go give it a try. Long story short, phenomenal Soul Food that's greatest strength is how simple and yet flavorful it is! The Beef Ribs were wonderful, very meaty and moist; the Salmon Cakes were savory and delicious with or without the included remoulade; the Macaroni and Cheese is thick, rich and hearkens back to a time when people put time and care into what they did; the Seasoned Rice is perfectly cooked and very flavorful; and the Soul Rolls will leave you wishing that the portion was MUCH bigger because they're so good. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that this food was this awesome and I ordered Take-out? All in all, as good as advertised and they greatly exceeded my expectations. I definitely WILL be back.",

    "text": "Okay in a pinch.... Was headed to a performance at Blumenthal's Performing Arts Center and needed a convenient spot to enjoy pre-performance dinner. Liked the atmosphere and friendly staff, but at best, the food was fair. I gave them three stars because of the prompt service and attention of our wait person. This was my second visit in two years and I was was unexpectedly disappointed. I ordered beef BBQ ribs, collard greens, mac n cheese and cornbread. Beef ribs are not typically tender so I was not surprised at the lack of tenderness, but they were tasty. I'm not sure what was going on with the collards. They were tough and somewhat bitter. On my previous visit, the collards were 5-star tender, succulent and tasty. Maybe it was a market issue where there was no  access to greens of a better texture. The mac n cheese was a little dry but the taste was spot on. The meal was not terrible, but I was disappointed. At one point a representative approached our table and asked if we were the patrons who had a problem with the fish. We were not, but that means someone else didn't enjoy their dinner either. I suppose I would be willing to chance another visit, but none of my party of six are willing to come with me. What a shame.",

She leaned over our table,with her butt in the other patrons face the entire time. Not impressed. I went a second time just in case they were having a bad day. I ordered catfish with okra and tomatoes. Again-YUCK! The catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it. The okra and tomatoes were alright.

The service - took ~10 min for someone to get our drink order and our waitress was not attentive. Plates weren't cleared until the end of the meal, so I had to keep stacking 'em.  The bad: waitress double charged me for the meal.

To her the charge disappeared a couple of hrs later.  In summary: probably won't be back.",

When he wasn't there to check on us, we resorted to asking a different waitress that walked by for boxes and the check. However, she didn't bother, probably because we weren't her table. Rudeness...

My lips were doing that quivering thing from being so full. This was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had.  Conveniently located in the heart of downtown, Mert's is the textbook example of what soul food means. The environment is casual and affordable, a bit jazzy, and very Southern. I felt like I was in a grandmother's kitchen, full of history and down home hospitality.  My run down of this epic meal can't do the flavors justice.   The cornbread was the best I've ever had, no competition. It was thick, warm, not crumbly, very sweet. It was a meal in itself.   The green beans were prepared in such a way that leads me to believe this is not a choice for the health minded. They were juicy, wonderfully greasy, and contained spots of other wonderful veggies and greens.  The candied yams were a treat. Each bite melts in your mouth as the flavors build in your mouth. A tad of cinnamon, a tad of syrup, a lot of velvety sweet potatoey love. My husband told me that these were the best thing he's ever eaten in his life.  Finally, the fried chicken breast was something of legend. The exterior texture was addicting but not salty or typical in anyway. The poultry itself had a ton if depth in terms of flavor, and tasted as if each inch of it was personally marinated somehow with a hint of smokiness, rotisserie, sweetness, peppery... Just a bit of everything. There isn't a fried chicken that can come close to Mert's as far as I'm concerned.   If you are in the Charlotte area, Mert's is a must. Not eating here would be the biggest missed opportunity while visiting. You can feel the love here: for the city and inside the food.",

    "text": "3.5 to 4 stars for food, but towards a 2.5 star for service. We ordered take-out at around 4:45pm on Saturday and got incredibly lousy service.   The two of us stood at the door waiting for someone to come to the front for about 5 minutes. Then, when someone finally came, they started to seat everyone else before even noticing my dining companion and I. When they figured out we were going to order take-out, they shafted us to the side and told us they'd take our order later. Another 10 minutes went by and they just kept seating people. FINALLY, 15 minutes after we'd entered the store, someone found the time to take our orders at the register. We then waited another 20 minutes for our food to get cooked and packaged to go. Luckily, we weren't hungry...  I ordered the salmon with cajun seasoning and sides of collard greens and okra. For $16, the salmon and sides were just an \"OK\" value for money. The salmon was at least 4 - 5 oz but the cajun flavors were much more bland than I remembered them to be. The collard greens were good! Sweet and flavorful with its texture being soft but not mushy. The okra was on the sour side and probably not something I would order again, but still tasted okay.   The cornbread was actually a HUGE disappointment. I consider myself a cornbread lover and expert. I don't mind them dry, moist, sweet or salty just as long as it has good flavor. Mert's was neither sweet nor salty...if anything it may have been the blandest cornbread I'd ever tasted. Dry on the outside, moister on the inside...but still not enough to make it interesting enough to eat. I almost NEVER leave cornbread behind, and yet for Mert's...I left maybe 80% behind.   Maybe eating at the restaurant would have given me a different / better experience. I just wouldn't order takeout if I were you.",

I love the mac-n-cheese and will often just order a veggie plate where I can pick 4 different ones to eat.  They always have vegetable specials so I can try something new every time I go.    They also had 4 different hot sauces on the table.  I made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make.",

I always dread going uptown because I am not quite familiar with the parking there yet. Luckily it wasn't to busy at the time so we were able to find a spot at a meter up front.   First thought was wow this place is tiny. The ambience is casual and the staff there are really friendly.   My favorite part the food. They bring out individual cornbread loaf's with a honey butter after you place your order. I must say it was great I ate mines and half of my mother's. I honestly would go just for the cornbread. Then we got the rest of our meals I ordered a chicken wing plate with red beans and rice with gravey. The chicken was flavorless tasted like flour. The WORST fried chicken ever. I expected so much more I mean I had to pour hot sauce all over just to eat it. The beans and rice were not much better. My dad ordered the special of fried turkey with stuffing gravy with mac and cheese and yams on the side. He did not enjoy his either and he is alot easier to please than I am. My mom had a fried shrimp po' boy with mac and cheese. She said she liked the mac and cheese it had a sweet taste to it.  Dessert we split a slice of German Chocolate cake. It was pretty good. They have a wonderful array of desserts to try.",

    "text": "I read a lot of great reviews for Mert's Heart & Soul and even got a recommendation to go there from my dad. For me, the dining experience was fine but not anything to write home about. They were out of cornbread when I first got there, so I had to wait 20-minutes for that. I am not exactly sure of why they were out, because I wasn't there at a busy time. Once I did get the corn bread, it was hot and tasty. I would have preferred more butter, because it was a tad dry.  Since I don't eat a lot of meat, I had the \"vegetable plate\" which allowed me to pick three sides. I had mac & cheese, collards, and baked beans. The mac & cheese was tasty, but a little bland for my ideal. This was more of a classic mac & cheese while I prefer something with a little zip to it. The collards were good. They seemed a bit sweet to me whereas I tend to prefer mine either spicy or tangy. The texture of the collards was right on. The baked beans were totally edible. Once again, they just weren't my favorite kind. They were all pinto beans in a kind of thin sauce. I prefer my baked beans in a thicker & spicier sauce. I got banana pudding to go for dessert which was delicious.",

The food is super delicious and the sizes are just right... filling if you are super hungry and choices for the not so hungry folks.  The prices are very reasonable, and frankly you cannot beat that in the Uptown Charlotte area.  Why not the fifth star?  Well because I feel that it's missing calillou, and island drinks, like sorrell.  If they made things like that, then it would be a perfect 5 stars.  I would love to see fried okras on the menu as well.  Even with all of these things that they do not have... they do have some super yummy things... Try their Sweet Potatoe Souffle!  Oh my goodness that is freakin' awesome!!!  It's like... sweet veggies and dessert all at the same time!  Super awesome!    Care for some soul food?  Definitely go to Mert's!",

It is a decent spot to check out for soul food, but not my number one recommendation. I will say that the cornbread was phenomenal, like best ever level cornbread, but that was where the meal deliciousness ended. My chicken just tasted like fryer grease and was extremely greasy and more burnt than crisp (everyone else at the table that got the fried chicken felt the same). The yams were over the top sweet, more like a dessert and swimming in sauce and the collards really didn't have any taste at all, and were at the point of over cooked. I will say that our server was wonderful and very pleasant, which helped the dining experience. Overall, I'm glad we checked out this place, but I don't think we will be back.",

They are located/attached to the Holiday Inn City Center, so I automatically assumed that the food and service would match the location, wrong! The service wasn't horrible, it was just slow.   The food on the other hand was horrible; the best thing I ate was the cornbread. The collard greens tasted like a mixture of vinegar, salt and lemon juice had been poured in the pot; I took one bite and realized that I was done with that portion of my meal. The cabbage was decent, but my cabbage looked moldy, yikes! The okra and tomatoes dish was meh; the okra was there, but the tomatoes were missing in action. The macaroni and cheese was old and dry. I am completely disappointed.  Will not return and I don't recommend you waste your money here. This place has an overall 3 star review for a reason.",

That doesn't make sense to me!!!! Take the endless mimosas off the menu if you're not gonna be serving them ... The only thing that taste okay was the water! One person in my party asked for lemon with her water, I guess they were out of lemons as well cause she never got it. I also wanted wheat toast. Guess what? They didn't have wheat bread!!!  So I had to choose biscuit or cornbread. I chose a biscuit and asked if she could bring plenty of jelly. She brung the biscuit and not the jelly. Had to catch her to get the jelly ! The jelly didn't help the biscuit at all it crumbled apart! I will never go to that place again!!!",

The menu wasn't that diverse and the items weren't exactly what I wanted and everything inside felt physically greasy like old residual oil that never goes away, I liked my meal, my sides, and the service.  The waitress was clearly working on her birthday and she took care of us: the food came out quickly, the checks were automatically split, and containers were brought for those of us with leftovers.  The pacing of the meal was perfect--I never felt rushed and also never got concerned we would run late or be tight for our post-lunch meeting.    The food was good and I plan on going back for some of the other items--more of the turkey options, the pulled pork, and different sides.  Also the desserts looked great.  I wasn't blown away or even really excited about anything which is why I just can't justify giving four stars.  But everything went well, tasted well, etc., which is why I think they deserve more than three stars.  Oh half star, where are you, elusive one?",

Secondly, they should take your number and text when you're table is ready. The menu is short limited southern options. Ok now the food it took a while to get a food by the way. The Mac n cheese was lacking seasoning along with the greens, and the CHICKEN . It needs a little bit more work to be called southern food. It's not your grandmas or your aunts cooking. The corn bread sets the bar very high because it's so good but everything else failed short. The cat fish is a no go and bad presentation. Even though the food wasn't so great The service is so nice and I would come back an support black owned business anytime.",

When we got here we got our names on the list and there was a decent crowd waiting already outside. We were seated inside within 20 minutes and waited on within 2 minutes of sitting down, mind you the inside and out was packed! We got our order in once we decided and got our food in about 10 minutes. We were really surprised how fast the service was considering the crowd! We both got fried chicken leg's and I had a side of Mac n cheese and collards. He got a side mashed potatoes with gravy and Mac n cheese. We loved the food! Everything was well prepared and seasoned! The cornbread was also absolutely to die for! The server was apologetic for the speed and gave us a complimentary slice of Oreo chocolate cake! We were totally shocked because we didn't feel in a rush and everything was done in a timely manner. The staff was super friendly and we loved the atmosphere! I would definitely recommend a trip!",

Salmon cakes, fried chx breast, Greens, cabbage and OF COURSE the Mac and cheese- all absolutely heavenly. Have a small selected of bottled beers and wines.

It was either too seasoned or not seasoned enough. Ironically, they have some of the best presentation for their food so that most definitely is not an issue for them.

And fried whiting that they enjoyed with yams that were amazing! The corn bread i enjoyed but nothing to write home about. Service was good even with the mix up of one our orders. The atmosphere of the restaurant could definitely use an update. The bathrooms were disgusting! All in all there was a line to get in and i do see why, Merts does have a lot to offer.

    "text": "Mert's, where do I start..  Soul Rolls- overrated in my opinion. Being raised in the soul they came off like a appetizer that someone went in the fridge and said ' I have some leftover greens, rice, ummm ohhh it's some black eye peas and well I guess I will cut up this chicken breast and toss it in a egg roll wrap that somebody left here'.   Nothing special about them, lack seasoning, just leftovers   Had the 3 wing platter, corn bread was on point. Rice was good but it's rice. Had high hopes for the chicken. I just knew it was an old black lady in the back with the seasoning making sure that it piece was destined for greatness.  Well needless to say, Hope floats and that idea floated right out the door on the first bite and the second and the third.   The atmosphere was nice, despite the chaos of the surrounding area right outside the door.  Parking, they validate if you park at the holiday right on the corner so that was great.   Ok spot, had character, can't say I would go back",

This weekend I received one of those \"bad news phone calls\" right before my food arrived. I took it outside and when I returned, I found the server had refilled my coffee and kept my food warming in the kitchen. It's a small thing but it says a lot about the people who work there. Always a pleasure to visit Mert's.",

First trip brought fried catfish, candied yams and a small salad with blue cheese dressing.  The catfish is fried whole and comes with some spicy, mayo-based sauce on the side.  Splash on some hot sauce and a squeeze of lemon and you get, YUM!  The sides were good as well.  Second visit, I went with the lunch special of the day, beef liver and onions.  OK, I know some of you just went, \"GROSS\"!  Don't be haters!  Liver is delicious, especially when it's prepared like this.  Slight char on it and covered in a great tasting   brown onion gravy. Tried the mac n cheese this time and it made me smile also.  They also bring a small individual loaf of cornbread and honey butter with lunch orders.  It is moist and flavorful and is a great add to the meal.  Service was fast and friendly on both lunch visits just like at breakfast.  Thankfully I work at the Southern end of Tryon and Mert's is towards the Northern end, just across from the Hearst Tower on College St.  Let's just say, I need that longish walk back to cubeville after a big, delicious lunch like this...",

The advantage of being on the road and dining for one did mean I got seated much quicker than the people on the wait list.  This time I ordered the salmon cake with yam and slaw, which Yelpers were highly recommending.  The sweet yam was like a dessert in itself - and I love candied yam so that was big tick for me.  The slaw was finely chopped and creamy, also lived up to expectation.  The Salmon cake tho - slightly under salted.  Seeing that this is poached salmon with added flavoring after, I think maybe some of the salmon flavor got lost along the way.  Overall still tasty and solid but I would say their other items such as fried chicken and ribs were more to my liking.  Service was also  little chaotic - it was packed.  The waitress brought me my food with my cutlery, and then my ice tea never came (I forgot about it too but never saw my waitress coming by and too hungry to wait).  And when I asked to get it to go, I ended up with sweetened tea instead of unsweetened.  Oh well.",

The restaurant itself is pretty small, but it adds to the overall feel of the place. The atmosphere is very intimate and southern with a home-y feel that everyone can enjoy. I had an incredible experience here and I wish I lived closer so I could come here all the time!!",

I ordered the shrimp creole and catfish combo with macaroni and cheese and yams.   The catfish was not the 'whole' catfish that the menu proclaimed-- it was a filet. The macaroni and cheese was not southern home style but reminiscent of Panera's. My yams consisted of four small pieces of sweet potatoe in heavy syrup. It was literally gone in two bites. The creole over flavored rice wasn't even worthy of a second bite. It was left untouched for the rest of the meal.   Totally unsatisfied with this dining experience.",

    "text": "We were in Charlotte for a basketball game and to celebrate my son's 20th birthday party.  We were a party of four and  a friend recommended Mert's.  It is not a very huge place at all and it was jammed packed when we got there but we sat almost immediately.  The decor is really cool and service is warm and friend from the time you walkj through the door.  The food is very good!  Not the place you want to go if you are on a strict diet because just about EVERYTHING is fried or fattening but this is the place you go to when you are off the diet wagon lol. They do have salads if you can stand to eat that healthy while your friends and family eat fried catfish and cornbread  :)  We loved the Soul RolIs as an Appetizer.  I had the blackened Salmon which was just okay for me. I was looking for more blackened seasoning for a little kick of spice, but it was ok.  My sweetie is a Lousiana man so he had okra and tomatoe, Shrimp creole and fried catfish. He is a better cook than me believe it or not and he said Mert's did a good job.  He loved it. My sons had fried fish french fries collards.   I loved the flavor of the greens  and I am a good cook so I can throw down on some collards. Mert's did the greens some justice for sure!   My family thoroughly enjoyed their meals and the cornbread and everyone left quite  full!  The prices are VERY affordable so even those on a very tight budget could go here.  and we had a wonderful, attentive and funny waitress named Paris!!!!    I would definitely go back (when I'm off the diet wagon) and would recommend this place to anyone who likes soul food!",

But everything else was just 'meh' to me.   I'd actually classify the offerings here more on the cuisine level, than down home comfort food. Down home comfort food is what I was looking for, and sadly I didn't get it at all. I hate to say it but flavor was missing in most of what I tasted. The egg roll appetizers filled with black eyed peas and greens, would have been a total fail had it not been for the dipping sauce. I found the main dish of red beans and rice to be totally lacking in flavor and overall taste appeal. Same went for the collard greens..bland-O.   The restaurant felt good and looked good. The food looked good, but didn't taste good. The service was top notch. Honestly, I'll probably give it another shot in the event it was just an off night.",

I usually order online on \"uptown2go\", so I know to give it about 20 minutes before collecting my meal. Lately, I have been a huge fan of their bbq sandwich. It comes on top of a buttered roll. Now if that doesn't get it poppin, what does?  Being a northern boy, I never really had the opportunity to munch out on some soul food. Let me tell you, this place has gotten me addicted to collard greens.   They also have good beans and cornbread. And when I want some beans and cornbread, I will go to Mert's for some beans and cornbread. If it wasn't for their beans and cornbread, I'd go somewhere else for my beans and cornbread.  LBD Scale- Easy 8. Now doubt in my mind that this place is a trademark southern soul food boutique. If there's any other places that you recommend, holla at me. But right this second, I'm all about Mert's. I WANT SOME MERT'S IN MY MOUTH!",

What's even better than their food though, is the wonderful service. From the time you walk in the door, you feel as if you are a guest at someone's house as opposed to a customer. They bend over backwards to bring you whatever you need and sometimes even anticipate what you may be needing before you get the chance to ask!  I highly recommend Mert's!!",

The biscuits?  Yum.  Sweet tea? But of course. And don't even get me started on the multitude of fresh cobblers and cakes available by the slice...

You know that it's homemade when you get that. Their Collards are plentiful with a spicy, tangy flavor. The Peach Cobbler was an exceptional dish all on it's own.  It wasn't just regular peach cobbler, there were hints of orange zest and ginger.    Next time, I vow to try something different and hope to resist the urge to order the fried chicken again!",

We ended up having an overload of cornbread as it comes complimentary, came in the sampler, and also came with our main dishes.  Left very stuffed and happy.

EllaEm's in LV is better. crispy juicy fail.  - A bone with no meat on my plate. rib fail. - Beef was not as tender as I would have hoped for. No mind-blowing flavor - Ordered a side of home fries but it was pending even after I finished my meal! lol - Home fries are not fries. It's more like chopped potatoes. Good thing I cancelled my order - Expensive heineken. Just get a Carolina.",

When my Mac and cheese and ribs came out there was barely any meat and it was definitely not a half rack like advertised.  In fact there was no \"rack,\" this was because they were off the bone pork ribs which was not explained in the menu, there was also no meat.  There is no way that macaroni should have taken and hour, as that and my boyfriend's food was on par with public school cafeteria food.  The only thing that was remotely redeeming was the cornbread, that was good.  The server was a sweetheart as well and took care of our bill because she recognized that the wait was ridiculous.  Much love to her.  How this place got 4.5 stars out of 5 I'll never know.  P.S.  My boyfriend and I are currently doubled over in abdominal pain, so that food was bad on many levels...",

I recently  decided to check them out again since I work upstairs from Merts  and boy oh boy  I'm still not impressed. I ordered a salmon patty  meal and the patties  were  under cook as well as the yams. The mac and cheese was extremely blend, but  surprisingly  the cornbread was  good. I decided to sent the salmon patty back because  it wasn't good and undercooked. The server asked me to scoop them off my plate so she could show the cook proof and asked did I want anything else. I told her chicken wings and not even 60 seconds later she comes with a plate of chicken.  I'm thinking boy  that was fast.  Never again will I eat there again.",

I know good southern home cookin when I taste it. This was definitely mediocre. The restaurant was crowded as it was a Saturday afternoon and there were many tourist such as myself on this particular day. I always order the same dish whenever I try a new \"soul food\" restaurant for the 1st time to play it safe: fried chicken, greens, yams. Well, the food was ok. That's it. The ambiance was nice though.",

While I loved the ambience and atmosphere of the restaurant, I have to say I was disappointed with the food. I had the beef ribs, collards, and mashed potatoes. The ribs were fatty and tough, the mashed potatoes were average and my collards were served cold. No Bueno. My boyfriend had the salmon patties which he said were just ok. The only thing worthwhile was the cornbread that came with the meal. Must say its some of the best I had. Overall I was underwhelmed and disappointed.

I noticed the manager staring at us and she finally got out server and I can see her saying something to her about us waiting forever. She finally gave us the check and we waited another 5 minutes to pick it up. Once she picked up our check, we waited another 10 minutes to give us our card back. Service was a little slow.

The portion size was perfect; though if there had been more on my plate, I would have kept on eating. This is the kind of meal that fills you up and warms you from the inside.   My only complaint is the small amount of options for gluten free diners such as myself, though that's relatively common among soul food restaurants. Any chance we can get some GF cornbread? The little loafs are so charming!",

My colleague and I are in Charlotte together for business at least once a year and this is always on our list of must visit restaurants.   Just like at home some of the side dishes aren't consistent. For example last year the red beans were so-so, but this year they were the best. The only exception to this is the black eyed peas. They are always AWESOME!!!  I don't even like collard greens that much but I'll share a serving from Mert's.   Fried chicken always done just right, salmon cakes tasty and slightly spicy. The remoulade sauce is a killer. It's even good on the chicken.   Portions are very generous and prices are reasonable.   Too bad I'm never here over the weekend for their Sat & Sun breakfast.  I'd love to try it.

The black-eyed peas were wonderful.  Perfect texture and smoky flavor.    The Mac and Cheese was not the best I've ever had but mac and cheese is a bit like sex.

The economy *is* bad!\"  If a mere picture of Mert's ribs gets 25 likes, imagine how many their flavor would get.   We stopped by after the wildly entertaining nuttiness of Speed Street. After a couple of beers on a hot night, all you need is grease to soak up the booze. That said, Mert's delivered, not greasy food, but high-quality, delicious, heavy Southern food that will absorb anything left in your system, and leave some cholesterol as a gift with purchase.   I got the Soul Rolls, essentially soulified egg rolls, with black eye peas, collard greens, rice, and a wee bit of diced chicken breast (though I didn't taste much of the chicken. Could have just been my particular rolls, tho). The others got varying dishes of fried chicken and beef ribs, with sides of fries, mac & cheese, collard greens, and the works.   \"You know, if I worked here, they would find me in the back with my head in a bucket of this mac & cheese,\" Ard said.  Yep, basically. Some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had in a restaurant.   Service is great here, too. Everyone was so patient with the troops of drunk teenagers who wandered in to use the bathroom, despite the sign on the door that read, \"Bathrooms for paying customers only.\" Our server, Netta, made sure that I ordered first, as a fellow Netta. So nice!   I think there's enough reviews here to cover ambiance, so I won't go on about that. But Mert's is cozy and the food is delish. Go enjoy!",

You can smell the wonderful aroma's of home cooked goodness wafting out of the building as you walk up. Interior is decorated in sepia with family photos old and new that lend to the idea that this is a family-owned business proudly serving great home style cooking to the community; a family tradition.   I ordered the fried whiting plate which comes with two sides and cornbread; I got collard greens and macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of yams. My fish was hot and crispy just like I like and well seasoned. I added hot sauce (Cholula) which added just the right zing. The greens were cooked perfectly (taste and texture) and the mac n'cheese was good (not great). My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits and gobbled one of my whiting fillets to go with. He got a side order of grits later because there was so much gravy on his dish. He said the addition made it perfect.  I kept taking spoonfuls of his grits because they were so deliciously prepared. I'm a snob when it comes to grits and Mert's does it right! The hubs never got his yams and the waitress did not protest when he brought it to her attention and asked to take it off the bill. We were full anyway. She seemed distracted the entire visit. I'd definitely return; thinking about a shrimp po'boy sandwich with a side of greens and yams before heading to the airport.",

    "text": "Well, this was my first meal in Charlotte, and it kicked my trip off right.  First off, the cornbread may be the very best I have ever had. Perfect texture, a little salty, a little sweet, and hot. Add some sweet butter, and holy moly!  We stopped in for lunch, and the service was a little slow, but there was a huge party, so that impacted things a bit. I had the chopped pork, steamed cabbage, and mashed potatoes.  The only thing that disappointed was the gravy. Everything else was so, so good.  The whole deal, including iced tea was $8.00, which is not far off what we pay for mcdonald's back home.  Yum!",

I really liked the pulled pork-- really flavorful and moist, but the fried chicken was mediocre. Especially after reading many great reviews, I was disappointed in the chicken. Really neat atmosphere downtown charlotte.",

    "text": "If your having a taste for soul food this a place to go. I've been here a few times and the food has never disappointed me. For the price point their portions are well off, enough for me to finish the rest the next day.  I recommend the fried chicken, catfish, yams and mac-n-cheese. I have always gone during slower to times so I've had quick service. The servers here are down to earth and tentative, but if you come here it's just for good food and laughs in my eyes. Be sure to visit this place at least once.",
