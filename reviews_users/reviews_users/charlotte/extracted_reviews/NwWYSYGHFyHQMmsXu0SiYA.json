They make an awesome burger because they GROUND THEIR OWN MEAT!  Finally, I can get my burger cooked Medium or Medium rare.  FLavorville has returned to my mouth.  I hate having to order a burger and not be able to get it under medium well ughh.  There is a bunch of toppings to chose from and daily drink specials.  For a beer and a burger it will probably costs you about $9.  I will definitely return anytime I have a craving for a burger. Also, they are opening a location in the LKN/cornelius area. Next to try, their stuffed burgers.",

    "text": "a couple of co-workers and i ventured outside of uptown proper for lunch and hit up the Burger Co. today.  it was my first time at the joint, located in the up and coming wesley heights area.  even though it is a repurposed old warehouse building, it has a real clean and tidy look to it.  not a whole lot on the walls, save the three or four vintage or made to be vintage looking neons.  i love seeing steel trusses in places like this.  and even though it looked clean, i am always leery of any place where my shoes stick to the floor.  we got there just in time to avoid the lunch rush and i imagine that waiting in that line to order could be a tad annoying.  but i imagine that it saves on wait staff?  i don't know, it feels weird tipping someone as i order at a counter.  the menu looked interesting with all the amalgam of burger, stuffed burger, and dog combos.  being a touch hungover, i went for the bacon cheeseburger with a side of tots and a coke.  just under ten beans.   the food came out pretty quick and it was an ample portion.  even after smashing it down, i almost had to unhinge my jaw to get a full bite of my burger.  the beef had good consistency and wasn't too fatty and the bacon was just right on the chewy to crunchy scale.  the tots were some of the best plain tots i have had.  really light and not oily at all.  as i progressed through the burger, my bottom bun pretty much disintegrated which left me pawing at ingredients instead of a sandwich.  that didn't thrill me, but it wasn't a bad meal.  i might have to return to try the sweet potato tots, but with Pinky's a stone's throw away, it will be tough.",

    "text": "The Burger Company has potential.  The concept and decor are really cool.  Unfortunately the food and service is lacking.  We were seated and about five mins later the hostess came back to get our drink order.  A few mins after that the server finally came to our table and said that they would be waiting on us.  A few mins after that different server can to our table, asked to take our drink order(order already taken by the hostess but still no beverages) and told us that she would be our server.  Through the confusion we got our app order placed and started with the roasted queso dip.  The chips came of not crisp or fresh. I don't know if they were, but they had the taste and texture of of chips setting under a heat lamp for a while.   Don't know what was roasted about the dip, it was just bland queso with 4 sliced jalapenos and a couple pieces of diced tom.  I decided to try a couple Chicago dogs and onion rings for my entree.  What came out was a fried hotdog on a bun with relish, diced tom and a few diced banana peppers.  Hardly a real Chicago dog and who wants to eat a fried hot dog?  Anyway, somewhat understandable as I ordered a Chicago style hot dog at a burger joint in NC.  I ate one and sent the other back.  My 2 companions however both ordered burgers.  You would figure if the name of the restaurant was \"The Burger Company\" that they would serve stand out burgers.  Both of my friends complained about there burger being dry and lacking flavor.  After finishing the meal we waited patiently for ten minutes to get our check.  We finally had to flag down the hostess to get our server, which was hard to understand because at this time there were only about 6 tables seated in the restaurant.   The food wasn't disgusting but in no way good either.  Our bill was $40 for chips, 2 small burgers, 1 hotdog and three drinks.  There are plenty of better places to grab a burger don't waste a trip or your money.",

    "text": "I've always found this place intriguing and decided to stop in today.  They have tinted glass on the windows, which suggests from the outside that this place is a bar or more formal restaurant. When you walk in, however, you discover instead that it is a well-lit , clean and very casual restaurant (with a low-key bar attached, too).   As many before me have noted, you order at the register and then take a seat to wait for your food.  For whatever reason, this ordering system seems perplexing at first (they are obviously trying to cut down on costs by not using servers), but, ultimately, I think it adds to the casualness of the place.    As I was just coming from yoga, I didn't want to unbalance my chakras, so I decided to go for the veggie burger, which interestingly is the ONLY non-meat thing on the menu (weird). I imagine they would sub a veggie or turkey burger for any of their other specialty burgers, but the menu didn't make it clear (I would recommend they put \"can substitute veggie or turkey burger\" on the bottom of their burger list).  I ended up with just a plain veggie burger and fries to go.  I attacked the fries whilst still in my car.  They were good and came in a LARGE bag, but I really found them to be identical to Wendy's french fries. Wendy's fries are good, of course, but I was expecting something a bit better from this place, so I wasn't blown away. The veggie burger was pretty bland upon first bite, but when I got home, I spiced it up with some light mayo and mustard and then it was pretty good. Not the best veggie burger in the world, so I probably would go for the turkey burger in the future.  Final verdict:  I'd definitely go here again (especially if I was doing something in a large group or sports related), but I'm in no rush.",

Probably should have told me when I ordered....The family wasn't over impressed with anything here. 2 stars for the sweet potato tots. We will not be back.

    "text": "I have eaten here twice now and both times have been very underwhelmed.  I tried the fullmore (I think that was the name) and the pimento.  My friends had the classic both times, they didn't like it either.    The deal breaker:  Here is what really made me not want to go back.  As I was waiting in line (lunch time) I was watching the cooks, They had pre-cooked the patties, then stacked  them on a heater/grill until they were needed.  They then re-fired the patty and squirt a seasoning liquid on the patties.  I observed the cooks for 5+ minutes, saw how they ran things.  I did the math and my burger had been cooked about 20 minutes prior to it hitting my table.  For a burger place, a place that really only does burgers, a place that calls itself \"the burger company\" this is ridiculous and poor form in any food establishment.    The result is a really dry patty, it is way overcooked, even for griddle style burgers where they typically cook them to well.  The patty was warm.    The dry patty maybe compensated by good toppings, but I found the toppings to be just a solid good.  on the fullmore I didn't like the bbq sauce (but that's a personal thing) on the pimento cheese the pimento cheese had been made into a spread of sorts, but was almost grainy and way over seasoned.  Customer Service.    I'd like to see another cashier during lunch, but that is minor.  But otherwise good service, friendly staff, polite.    Sides:  Fries a solid good, sweet potato fries were very good, onion rings just OK.",

Sadly burgers always seem a little underwhelming.  Not bad, just not what it's hyped to be.  The patty is a quality mixture and usually well prepared.  I don't bother ordering burgers to temp.  You know that just never happens.  However, the bun takes over.  It's a decent bun, just not the right ratio.  And the special toppings that make your mouth water are way under done.  You'll want a little more.  Service was good.  It didn't take long for our order to be brought out.  I would have been happy to wait five minutes longer to get HOT tater tots.  That might have been the difference between just enjoying a late lunch and LOVING it.  In all my visits I've found the sides to be generous in portion but hit/miss in quality.

Asked for chili on the side but the server informed us the kitchen made them with the chili on them and could remake them. Just ate them with the chili. I got the turkey burger, and the toppings combination was great, feta, cucumbers, lemon aioli, avocado. But the burger itself was unimpressive, and pretty small. Boyfriend got the hot mess.

Because there service has gone down hill. Tonight was likely my last visit after having my burger come out not as ordered. I waited 5 mins for my server to come back by. I tried to get her attention to no avail. Then after the person I was with was half finished. I decided to go ahead and eat it as it was. A few mins later she finally comes back to ask how we wanted the check. She was not concerned that either of our drinks were completely empty. I thought maybe she is bring us more tea. Nope she just came back with my card and never offered me a refill. ( this server only had 2 other tables).   There are too many options for good burgers to deal with the prices and service that has gone downhill. Sadly I will be going to bad daddy's or pinkys next time.",

They were so nice to us and the bartender kept good conversation with us the entire time. We suggest the Rueben burger and the Carolina style burger. Burgers were cooked to perfection and so delicious! Loved the chili they used on the Carolina burger. Great place! Not a huge beer selection, don't expect microbrews.",

    "text": "I would never eat here again.  Was really craving a turkey burger, my coworker told me this place was pretty decent and 'cheap'. I thought I'd give it a try and was horribly disappointed. I ordered take out.  First the price for the regular turkey burger says it costs 6.75. I ordered the turkey burger, I said no pickle and that I wanted cheese. I guess they still wanted to charge me that extra .95 for the slice of cheese even though I didn't want the pickle. They asked if I wanted fries and I thought, sure why not and that side order of fries brought it up to $11.89.  So basically the burger on its OWN costs $6.75. Mind you the price range for this place is rated as cheap. Also be aware that I do know that turkey burgers range in price between $8-11 but that's usually with fries included and your getting a pretty big burger.  I asked for ketchup, mayo, and mustard. They didn't even put it in the burger, I got everything in little packages on the side. It felt like I was getting a fast food burger rather than a quality restaurant burger. If I had known I was getting side packages I would have just said 'give me a plain burger'.  The budget itself was small. Aside from that it had a weird ranch sauce in it, I didn't know this came in it, they should really ask customers of they want that in it. We all have different taste, maybe some of you like it, but I did not.  The fries were probably the worst part. Really soggy, plain, and they felt terribly greasy. You're telling me I paid an extra $2.50 for a few fries, and they were soggy?  To sum it all up, no I would not recommend this place, that food was not worth the $11.89 I paid. Try it at your own risk and I hope you have a better experience then I did.",

Service was good and quick.  On my second visit I opted for the Man Salad (crisp greens, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, a burger patty, french fries & cheddar cheese) because I knew I'd be stuffed after the TATOR TOT NACHOS.  The burger was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.  And did I say that I liked the TATOR TOT NACHOS?!?  :)    Haven't dined outside, but I hear they have a high tech misting system for outdoor eating...and I believe it's dog friendly too?!?  Glad to see that area of town getting some good restaurant action!",

    "text": "We decided to give The Burger Company a try last night.  Unknowingly, we walked in and seated ourselves since there was no signage.  That's when I noticed the \"ORDER HERE\" sign above a counter on the other side of the huge room.  We walked over and perused the pretty extensive menu.    I liked that they had a variety of burger (and hot dog and salad) combinations.  Best of all, their prices were VERY reasonable.  We started with $4 fried pickles as an appetizer.  I then ordered the Pimento Cheese Burger (also topped with bacon) and a side of fries.  My partner tried the Slaw Dog and tater tots.  They also had a pint of Bud Light for $1.50 so, hey, why not?  Naturally, in NC, you can't get a burger cooked to your liking (just medium well/dry or well/charred).  My burger came out pretty juicy and full of flavor, though, so I was impressed!  It tasted much better than some people's favorite: Five Guys.    The hot dog was just your regular 5-6\" red hot dog; it would have been nicer to have a longer or thicker dog, but for about $3, it's affordable enough to order two if you're really hungry.    The fries were a semi-thick cut and mine came out very hot.  Unfortunately, my partner's tater tots were lukewarm, so they could have been better.    We both agreed that the fried pickles were pretty abundant for only $4, superhot/fresh, not-too-salty, and delicious.  Two thumbs up!  (And I don't even like pickles.)  All in all, it was a tasty, cheap dining experience.  I loved the atmosphere of the old converted/remodeled warehouse/garage, brick walls, and large windows.  And I could tell that when it's warmer out, sitting outside on the spacious patio that has a fantastic view of the Uptown skyline, would be an exceptional experience as well.    My only recommendation?  Signage at the front door for newcomers that you need to order at the counter and then seat yourselves.  p.s. I was intrigued by the \"Man Salad\" on the menu - a combination of regular salad items plus hamburger...and French fries.  Let your imagination run wild!",

    "text": "It's sad whenever a place goes \"downhill\" instead of up. We came here for a quick lunch yesterday (Sunday). We were seated by one of the waitress (which is confusing, because we used to sit ourselves and order up at the counter). We placed our order of 2 burgers (one plain, one BYO with swiss, bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms) and 1 side of fries immediately. 15 minutes and counting later we still didn't have any food. The place had a few tables but surely wasn't packed. AND it's only 2 burgers. That's pretty much the only thing they serve and how long could it possibly take?!  When the food finally arrived, it's disappointingly overcooked, bland and small. The burger patties were crisp on the outside and quite dry and tasteless on the inside (but not in a good way, like smashburger way). They have shrinked so much the buns overwhelmed the meat. Speaking of the buns, they were plain; they didn't even put it on the grill or through a toaster. The \"best\" part: my BYO burger only came with 3 out of the 4 toppings I requested. If it took them 20 minutes to fix a burger, it should be perfect. We have decided at this point we'll likely never be back. $6.75 for a dry burger that took 20 minutes yet still missing a topping is probably a \"bargain\" I can skip. However, I do give credit where credit is due. When I informed the waitress that my grilled onions were MIA, she addressed to the manager who offered a free dessert. Granted I think they should have discounted or comped my burger, but at least he tried. And the fries were good. Good luck to The Burger Company, I hope you step up the game because at this rate the future is not looking good for you.",

Even though they have a number system to let waitstaff know where to bring food my burger went to another table. The person opened my burger and told the waitress it wasn't their burger.  Then she brought it to me. After some strange person touched the food, she still wanted to give it to me.  As she gave it to me she told me it was my burger with no lettuce.  Not only was there lettuce on the burger it was mixed in with the fries.  She rolled her eyes and huffed as I told her there was no lettuce.      The food in general was less than ok.  Burger and fries were cold.  In fact the fries were not cooked all the way.    I needed another napkin and got up to get one. There were only 2 dispenser, one on each end of the place. A waitress fussed at me for getting my napkin.  Apparently the one I used was for employee's only.    With some good competition around them their standards are not enough.",

There were plenty of empty tables and it still took an hour to get our food which was cold by the time it got to our table. Too hungry to send it back and too aggravated to wait longer for it to be corrected.  A large part of the problem appeared to be the management. Servers were bussing their own tables. There was no hostess so servers were having to seat tables, too. There were people waiting at the door and servers were just walking past them without saying a word. A couple of times, we saw a man who looked like he may have been an owner or manager. He didn't interact with customers but walked up behind servers to bark an order never offering to help.  Too bad about the food and service. A total waste of an awesome space with very cool decor. The next time we're in that area of town looking for a great burger, we'll go to Pinky's.",

It's a casual and inexpensive place - you order at the register and they bring your food to the table. The lines can be long during prime dining hours, so I recommend going a bit early.   We had the chili queso fries to start, and they were excellent! The chili was very good and they topped the fries with a generous portion of queso. Yum!  A note on the burgers - you can't get them cooked your way. All burgers are cooked medium-well to well-done. I usually prefer my burgers medium-rare, so that's one reason for my lower rating. But, I have to say, the burgers were still pretty tasty. And for around $5 each, they were a bargain, too!  I had a stuffed cheeseburger which was generously stuffed (and topped) with cheddar. My hubby had a bacon cheeseburger. We shared a side of delicious onion rings.  Burger Company is located in a cool old building and there's plenty of parking. Its very inviting and comfortable inside, and the staff are friendly and helpful.   All in all, we enjoyed our meal and will likely return.",

    "text": "We picked up a LivingSocial coupon for TBC, and decided to head there for a Sunday lunch. The place is in an old warehouse, which has a cool kind of vibe to it. You walk up and order, and the lady at the counter seemed genuinely uninterested in her job, and gave off a pretty bad vibe to start. I ordered the Pesto Burger and my dad ordered the Buffalo Burger. She asked my dad \"Mild or hot\" and my dad said \"Somewhere in the middle\" and she gave him this kind of are you kidding me stare. Bad start. We also got onion rings and fries with drinks, and it came out to be about $21 (10 with the coupon).  The food came out quickly, and I took a bite of my burger. The first thing I noticed was the bad bun. It's like a simple white bun that is...mealy. Not good. The patty was pretty good, and the little pesto sauce it had was good as well. The cheese was all right. Next I had a french fry...oh my, these were worse than any place I've been to in awhile. They were...mealy again, just not good. Ugh. Onion rings were good. My dad said his was okay, but didn't like the crunch associated with the celery on the burger.  Overall, I wouldn't come back here. Bad Daddy's is a much better alternative. I would keep away if I were you unless I lived right in the area.",

We were seated promptly and acknowledged by our server who was friendly and efficient.  My wife ordered Mushroom Swiss burger and I ordered the Rise N Shine (burger with lettuce, tomato, bacon, American cheese and a fried egg.  I asked for Cheddar cheese instead of American.  We both ordered our burgers medium (warm pink center).  My wife received medium well.  Mine was well, the egg was hard-fried, and the cheese was suspiciously American (yuck).  We ate the burgers anyway since we were really hungry. It wasn't until we were 50% done that the waiter asked how everything was (and I told him).   I also ordered an iced tea. Their water is awful and thus their tea is awful. I don't understand why restaurants don't filter their water.  All of their beverages would taste better. This is a problem all over the Charlotte area.  Anyway, the price was reasonable --- if only the food was made as requested and the water was filtered.  We will not return.",

    "text": "I like Burger Company. I go to Law School down the street (and because of Burger Company's proximity to campus and because there aren't a ton of options nearby), I'm no stranger to it. In fact, I can honestly say that my first year I probably went to Burger Company (AT LEAST) once a week, and usually more than that.   What I like about it: They're fast. Your meal gets to you quickly, even on a busy day. The food options are really good too. I've tried a number of different burgers, the chicken sandwich, the wings, appetizers, salads, and I've never been disappointed with the flavor. And unlike some of the other reviews that I've read, I don't really consider their burgers to be pricey. The bar is pretty cool too. They have some nice drink specials and a pretty good selection. The waitstaff is always very friendly.  Not to be picky, but the one thing that I noticed is that when my classmates and I have gone, on a number of occasions our tater tots have been cold and once even (almost) frozen. And sometimes when it gets busy a burger will be missing something important like chili (which happened a couple of times as well). It's just that attention to detail that is keeping me from giving it a 4 or 5 star rating, but it's close. I would give it a 3.5+ if I had the option.  But overall I would definitely come back here again and again even if it wasn't right down the road from school. Overall the food is really tasty here.",

We walked in the door and it seemed great. Friendly people and thriving environment.  We order our food and drinks and did not see the waitress for a while. All of our drinks were empty and got we got up ourselves to get our refill. For fifteen minutes our food was sitting in the window waiting for the waitress to give it to us (still missing). When the food did arrive it was cold but was decent food. We had asked to speak to the manager that literally ran into the back and told a waitress to say he was off today. We all knew he was there and later on the same lady who said he was off spilled the beans and said he was in the kitchen. So he never came to speak to us.  We got the check with 50% off the bill but they added $10 extra for wings we did not order. After they fixed that, they did it again by adding a burger. Seriously this was awful. I expected to pay the whole bill even with the mistakes, all I wanted was to talk to the manager but he was to afraid to have good customer service skills and to do his job! If you go to this place PLEASE LOOK AT THE RECIEPT!!!!",

Typically, whenever i order a buffalo sandwich anywhere, i have to request additional buffalo sauce. Not this time. This burger was dripping with buffalo sauce. Messy, yes. Delicious, yes. The simple addition of celery pieces made the burger more than just a patty with sauce. Yes, the sweet potato tots were a great side. Way better than normal tater tots, but not as good as sweet potato fries, in my opinion.   They do have a full looking bar and they have daily specials of some sort. One day they had $2.75 drafts. Don't recall when or what all they had, but i remember a beer or two i wouldn't mind next time. However, they do have my favorite crushed ice if you go with the fountain drink.   You order at the counter, stick the number on your table and wait for your food then apparently just leave your trash for them to pick up. Does that deserve a tip? Probably a lil something something, but when you prepay and don't carry cash, it gets a whole lot of nothing.",

It is just so convenient for a quick work lunch.   I have to say it has def improved. I have yet to order the chili since my first visit, ya know because I like my taste buds the way they are. I could burn myself at home with Cayenne if I really wanted to.   Some of the best onion rings around, nice big ones, with a perfectly crispy batter. Tots are great, the burgers are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes I get a huge juicy burger, but I have gotten smaller, brickish looking things once or twice.  The customer service is amazing. I think thats why I keep coming back. One of the managers is great (didn't catch his name) Very friendly and personable, promoting their new trivia night on Tuesday! All the girls who work there smile and greet you, I've never had even a slightly bad  experience with the employees.    I will keep returning for a good burger, and some of my fav onion rings!",

    "text": "I've waited an awful long time to visit The Burger Co. - and I'm not sure why? So, here's the deal...  In a sea of pretty damn tasty burger joints, The Burger Co. fits right in the middle for me. It's good, but it's not great.   The Good: It's a nice looking place on the inside - I'd like to see it filled up before Panthers games, but the Panthers would actually have to be good, first. Other good things...they grind their meat fresh daily - I could tell as my burger wasn't the typical round frozen patty. It was a fresh patty smothered in cheddar cheese with my choice of toppings. For $5, the burger was pretty filling. They have a large variety of burgers, a few, salads, and a nice selection of sides. Staff were extremely friendly and laid back, which works well with this order & deliver concept. Don't expect waiters/waitresses here, but they do have a full bar with some decent drink specials. Nom.  The Meh: Your burger doesn't come with a side, which isn't too bad considering the burgers are pretty affordable. I ordered the sweet potato tots, and they were just a little sweet for me. They were off the charts sweet with the coagulated cinnamon sugar butter that came with them. I'll pass on that next time. However, the tots were perfectly cooked and crispy. And while my burger was tasty, it could have used a more flavor or some type of magical schmear on the bun.   Overall, it was a good burger - but this place is now in competition with a handful of really great burger joints. Here's hoping they turn out some delicious bites to fend off that fierce competition.",

    "text": "The Burger Company is a smart new contender in an up and coming area of Wesley Heights. They opened Monday April 5th to big crowds, mainly neighbors clamoring for a new restaurant to walk to especially to watch NCAA tourney finals on all their big screens. The space is a big open warehouse space with a sizeable bar.  Now to the menu: they focus on burgers (duh blondie), but their mantra is fresh and affordable. We spoke with the owners and he put plainly \"If we don't nail a menu item in the next couple days it's off the menu. I only want to have things we excel at.\"  They really thought through all their menu choices such as choosing to only have a 5oz burger to keep it affordable (which to me is on the small side and you need another menu item). Affordable it is- a plain burger is only $4, and most of their specialty ones are $5 and $6 at most. You can add a patty for $1.50. I would prefer a choice to upgrade to a larger 7 or 8oz patty as a jumbo option- they grind their own meat there, so a thicker patty could offer a more rare option, but I get their mantra and in this economy I don't blame them. The beef was a little more lean than I expected it to be. They also offer a \"stuffed\" patty option which has American cheese in the middle. Other menu options include a marinated grilled chicken sandwich (I'll try that next time), some funny salads including a \"Man Salad\", and good wings. I recommend the hot honey BBQ flavor.  Once Pinky's Westside Grill opens across the street I bet they'll have some competition for their good fried pickles. We tried their sweet potato tater tots with cinnamon butter. The owner was undecided if that would remain on the menu. The sweet potato fries are actually waffle fries. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, so if you want a $12 gourmet burger, go to Liberty. If you want a place you can go in your tattered tshirt to watch the game and not blow a wad of cash, come to the Burger Company. Service was apathetic at best, but hopefully that was opening jitters. The owners seem very open to feedback and were very friendly. I forgot to suggest adding a turkey burger.   Every day they'll have a $1.50 draft special and they have an extensive martini/cocktail list for a place like that. Wesley Heights will be glad to have a good neighborhood bar now. They have outdoor seating and plan a winter heated patio on the side as well. I think they'll do just fine. It's so close to uptown and SouthEnd I think it will work well.   No website yet, but they are on Facebook and you can find their menu on there.",

Tried it on a weekday around noon, expecting it to be packed and it wasn't - I walked right up and ordered.   I got a turkey burger with grilled onions and tots. I'm a plain jane type of burger person, but hey, if a burgers not good plain, it's not good, in my opinion. The turkey tasted like beef, which I like because I can tell myself I made a healthy choice and its just as good. The burger itself was messy and hot, and had a pepper-y taste to it. The cheese was melted, the onions caramelized and a fluffy bun. The tots were crispy and salty, and they gave me a pretty big serving of them. The whole meal was heavenly.   Great place if you're craving a burger. They have a ton of options and some special burgers too.",

    "text": "I had a chance to go here on Saturday for lunch.  I arrived at noon and wasn't quite sure if I should seat myself as there wasn't a hostess stand or anything near the door.  It wasn't until a gigantic signed that read \"Order Here\" caught my eye that I realized that there was no hostess and that you go up to the front counter and place your order there.  I am not gonna lie, it took me about 5 minutes to digest the entire menu and all the available options before I was able to go up to the friendly lady behind the counter and place my order.    Food:  I ordered the Build Your Own Stuffed Burger with grilled onions, bacon, mushrooms, and avocado, something deep inside of me also told me to add BBQ sauce, so I did, and it was the perfect compliment (see pics).  The burger tasted extremely fresh as did the avocado and onions.  I agree with a previous reviewer that stated the actual meat could've used a bit more seasoning.  But otherwise the burger was perfect and cooked to perfection.  It wasn't overcooked or dry at all.  The bacon also added nice crunch, texture and taste.  Oh, and let me not forget the cheddar cheese that slowly oozes out of the burger the second you bite into it - ECSTASY!  Facility:  I wish I could use a word other than \"warehouse\", but that's exactly the vibe you get when you walk in.  Its very open and well lit with plenty of natural lighting.  They have a good amount of screens, though they could def have had more.  Staff:  When we walked in, my gf and I were greeted by a friendly staff.  Our food was brought to us exactly as we ordered it.  A friendly lady also came and cleared our table once we were done with our burgers.   Price:  My gf and I ordered two Build Your Own Stuffed Burgers, fries and a coke, it came to around $18 or so.  Certainly not cheap, but not overpriced by any means, especially when you consider you are getting a fresh, stuffed burger with fresh ingredients, and they certainly have cheaper options on their menu as well.    All in all, this place works on every level.  I'm a fan, and I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I'm sure most of you have concluded by now that I'm somewhat of a burger enthusiast.. connoisseur.. aficionado.. whatever. We've already enjoyed the burger creations at nearly every other burger joint in the QC, so it was only natural that our next stop would be the semi-famous Burger Co. With an immense menu of mouthwatering, artery clogging goodies it was pretty hard to make up our minds. Do we get a regular burger or a stuffed burger, a hot dog or nachos, or maybe just some BBQ chicken salad. After hearing that the meat gets ground fresh in house every day.. I couldn't resist the urge to sink my teeth into a stuffed burger.  After much deliberation we decided on an array of greasy / trashy appetizers and burgers (our favorite kind) . We started the night with the fried pickles and chicken wings. The fried pickles were pretty good, but not very consistent. Some were cut nice and thin and some fat, some were super crispy and others not so much. I've never had a fried pickle that I didn't like, but these needed a little work. The teriyaki chicken wings were delicious. Ten wings for $7.50 makes them slightly cheaper than most places and they were thick and juicy enough to easily recommend.  Ella ordered the pimento burger with pimento cheese, tomato and bacon and a side of sweet potato tater tots with cinnamon sugar butter. The burger itself was nice and juicy and had lots of flavor. The pimento cheese was lacking a little personality, but the bacon made up for that. The tots were awesome and definitely Ella's favorite part of the meal. She was really exited to try something that she had never had before. They were sweet and crunchy and matched perfectly with the cinnamon butter.  I got the Freemore stuffed burger with BBQ sauce, onion rings, bacon, tomatoes and stuffed with cheddar cheese. This was definitely an A-Class burger and with the addition of a better bun this would be one of the best burgers in Charlotte. The bacon was thick, the cheese was melted within the patty, and the BBQ sauce  / onions rings were the perfect additions.  Burger Co. easily wins our favorite burger for the neighborhood. Pinky's failed to impress us twice in a row and they're not likely to get a third shot after our trip to the Burger Co. If you're in the area and looking for some artery clogging deep fried deliciousness you need to check out the Burger Co.",

We walk in, it has an open, industrial feel. Three greetings from servers, you can walk to the counter and order or full service at the bar. You know where I sat. Tuesday $2.25 bottled beers, I ordered a turkey burger add jalapenos.  My turkey burger was DELICIOUS. It was moist and juicy, seasoned perfectly, it was oversized sticking out of my perfectly buttered grilled roll.   I would drive there just to eat the turkey burger again.

    "text": "After hearing much about The Burger Company, it was high on our radar to eventually check out. With not much time spent in the Freemore area on Sundays, usually due to the heavy traffic for Panthers games, we decided to brave the crowds. We were delighted to find a parking space right in front, a rather open seating arrangement, and only a few people there pre-game. We walked right up, placed our order, and grabbed a comfy half booth on the wall.   I decided on the stuffed burger Buffalo style. It was great. I'm not one to go for beef, but this sounded too good to pass up. The burger was stuffed with cheese (of which variety I'm not certain), topped with buffalo sauce and celery and a side of tots. It was awesome. The burger wasn't massive, easy to handle and was perfectly messy. I was in love. The tots on the side....just textbook perfect. Crunchy, crunchy, crunchy and the right amount of soft interior that your palate beckons for. The sweet potato tots....not so much. I'm not typically a fan, but these were a little lackluster.   The service was a bit odd, too. Lots of people standing around and it did take a little while for our food to arrive. However, I say it was worth the wait. The entire menu didn't look all that impressive or unique, but I think I hit the money spot with the stuffed burger. Plus, I'm a sucker for buffalo sauce.   The space is rad. Very open, but with far too many televisions for my liking. Great for a gather, game day, etc. Also, they have two killer patios. Hello, summer.   I can say I'd be back, but not sure I could say I'd venture outside of my previous order.",

    "text": "If Big Daddy's and Five Guys had a baby, the Burger Company would be the baby....just not as special. I haven't been to the West Morehead Street area in awhile and was surprised to see all the new buildings/ businesses in the area. They have a parking lot and an gravel lot right beside it. A bit confused walking in there---I wasn't sure if you just sit and order or go up but then I saw around and you order, take a number, sit and they bring it out to you. The place was hopping for a Friday night, really busy with only one register open though so they could definitely use two open to be more efficient.   Huge selection of burgers plus you can customize your own. Of course the Stuffed Burger area caught my eye b/c I'm having a burger, I want to go all out and have it be stuffed with Cheddar. I ended up going with the Left Coast Burger which was loaded with cucumbers, avocado, jalapeno and avocado mayo but the bun didn't hold well together so a bit sloppy to eat. All in all, a good burger with fresh fries. And they have sweet potato tots--who knew those even existed!? I will definitely check it out next time. Another thing I am looking forward to with my next visit--crushed ice! I heart crushed ice.  A number of drink specials including Jager bombs, beer specials and margaritas for $5 on Friday night. I'm happy they have drink specials since they were a lot of kids present so a drink would be much needed for me. A pretty cheap place for a decent burger with lots of burger concoctions. Citipass friendly as well--two coupons--one for $10 off a $20 purchase, another one for BOGO 50%",

    "text": "2.5 stars   We figured we'd try the burger place up the street from us and sadly weren't too impressed. We came here after work for dinner on a weekday, there were only a couple of other people in the joint. Our waitress had slightly unpleasant attitude, we felt very rushed to eat and leave despite the lack of crowd. What I really hate about this place, is the fact that they don't have an exact closing time posted on the door, do they close whenever they please? Seems like it since I have seen the place close at varied times.   I ordered the black bean burger, the bf ordered the hot mess with chicken, and we both had the tater tot nachos to split. I like the idea of the tater tot nachos, but they need to stick to an actual nacho structure. The large amount of lettuce really gets in the way. I was not very happy with my burger, it came out small, soggy, and unseasoned. My bf and I thought the hot mess was subpar, it didn't really have the heat component or flavor he was looking for. I asked to switch out the cilantro sauce for chipotle ranch, and they charged me extra! That is messed up, I don't like when places charge extra for sauce unless you are Buffalo Wild Wings, then I don't like it but I get it. Either way, I thought it was overpriced for the size of the meal.   I prefer Bad Daddy's, they have amazing burgers, you don't have to purchase your side separately, and the service is far better. I don't think I'll be back unless I am craving a burger and Pinky's is ridiculously packed. If you decide to dine here, I would stick to the beef or chicken burgers.",

I should've known it was going to be a bad experience because it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order and the place wasn't busy. So finally we ordered our drinks and food at the same time and then it took about an hour for us to get a burger and a chicken sandwich. The waitress was unapologetic and essentially ignored us. She also brought us other people's food and drinks and once she realized we still had not received our food, she blamed another waiter for messing things up. We're pretty sure she just forgot about our order are our table. Also the hostest check in on us more then out waitress. We are pretty laid back and I understand people have bad days so I try to sympathize with waiters.   Lastly, why I am giving the Burger Co. just a single star, once the food arrived.... It was blah. The burger was ok, sweet potato tots were ok and the Buffalo chicken sandwich was kind of a disaster. Instead of tossing the chicken in buffalo sauce, they just put buffalo sauce on the bun. So when you get a bite of chicken thats off the edge of the bun it wasn't very Buffalo-y, it was just a chicken tender.  We should have walked next door to Rhino Market and Deli, that's what happens when you like to try new places.",

The Lady and I didn't have the wait time issue that others have griped about, we were greeted pretty immediately, sat down, and everything was completed in a pretty timely manner! I ordered the turkey burger add jalepenos (shout out to Tonya P. for her suggestion :) ) with sweet potato fries, and the lady ordered the black bean burger with regular fries. My burger was actually really good, cooked well and still juicy. The sweet potato fries are waffle-ish cut and could stand with a little less time in the fryer, they came out a bit too crisp and greasy. The cinnamon butter that came along with it was the bomb. I want that on everything. The Lady thought her burger was okay as well. Not bad, just not anything special. Prices in general are a tad bit high for the product, but not outrageous at all.  I'm perfectly happy coming back here again, but I don't think it'll be at the top of our list. For now, Rhino has captured our heart. But we've still yet to have Pinky's...",

    "text": "So this was my first time going to the Burger Co. expecting to have a wonderful experience. My family was there, and they had asked me to join them for a meal prior to going home. Upon entering the establishment, I was never greeted, however, I let that one slide due to the fact that I could see that they were somewhat busy. As I sat down, I kissed my family hello, and was greeted by a waitress who was tending to their table, and I had asked the same waitress for a menu showing that I had all intensions of ordering. My family was just finishing up their meal, and was raving about how good the food was. Excited to try something from the menu, I was highly disappointed when the waitress never returned to take my order for what felt like 20 mins which infuriated me to the point where I lost my appetite. When the waitress did return to the table, she apologized for the long wait, however, by this time it was too late. She asked me if I was ready to order, and I expressed to her that I was going to order, however, due to the long wait, I had lost my appetite and wasn't happy. Sadly to say, due to the poor customer service that I received, I will not be returning to this establishment nor do I have any intentions on recommending this place to anyone. Even if their food is the greatest in the world, which I would never know, when it comes to customer service, I believe that ppl tend to forget of how that plays a part of how an establishment can be viewed. Sometimes saying, I'm sorry\", is just not good enough. There could have been a little more remorse of not tending to the table in a timely fashion by maybe offering a coupon or a gift card etc, for my next visit once it was noticed that they messed up, and had an unhappy customer. Therefore, I give them 2 stars.",

I managed to find the booth in the far corner had a power outlet next to it, so that really rocked for charging up my phone while I ate.  I had the Pimento burger which was very good. Cooked closer to medium well than medium, but good flavor and plenty of nicely cooked bacon. There is no bun in the picture because I'm doing a keto diet.  Ignore the fact that I had onion rings. They were also delicious. Crispy and crunchy.  They have a bunch of televisions tuned in to sports, indoor and outdoor seating and a large selection of local and macro beers. Plenty of parking and if you get bored, Town Brewing is next door.  [Review 11345 overall, 1122 of 2019.]",

First, the lights in the women's restroom wouldn't turn on. They have one of those motion sensors that is supposed to turn the lights on when you open the door but it didn't turn on. It even has an \"on,\" \"auto,\" and an \"off\" setting but none of them would work.  After we ordered, we waited what felt like 30 or 45 minutes to receive our food. They were busy but neither the dining room nor that patios were full. Also it didn't really seem like they were understaffed. As in, no one looked like they were running around with their heads cut off trying to keep up with the amount of people.  To top it off, the food was just okay. I ordered a pimento BLT burger with onion rings and both were lacking in flavors. Everything was warm, not hot. We would have expected more flavorful, fresh burgers from a place that specializes in burgers. Sorry guys, but we won't be back.",

    "text": "We stopped in for some lunch before heading home. This place caught our eye and we wanted to give it a try. The place is set up like a sports grill and bar with large inside and outside seating.  They have a full bar. It's a burger place so expect signature burgers, beef or turkey,  or build your own.  There is a long list of add ones and you can choose from several bun types. They also offer wings, tenders, and grilled chicken options.  A massive screen tv hangs from the wall for watching your favorite game on and there are other TVs scattered around the establishment.  I cannot say enough about the staff. They were so friendly.  Our waiter was one of the most genuine and nicest guys I've experienced in a restaurant.  He seemed as though he was genuinely happy to be our server.   I ordered a burger with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and bacon on a standard bun. My son got the Route 66 burger. I was surprised that the size of the burger patty seemed small compared to the height of the whole thing. The meat was also basically tasteless.  It needed seasoning. In addition it appears to be a frozen patty and not fresh. I could be wrong, it could be that they use fresh and use a party machine but it didn't seem that way.  The burger patty had that old school diner look and taste. The add one make it better. The bacon was nothing special either.  My son said his was good but nothing special. Our fries were nice and hot and crispy. Ketchup, mustard, and mayo are in containers on the table so you have to add that yourself. The food was average and that's why they get 3 stars. The ambiance above average.  The service was excellent!",

You look around and there is a huge sign that says order here. We were not sure what to do. Why have both signs?  The place was not busy for a Friday night which should tell you something. I ordered the Hot Mess burger which the waiter recommended. The food took longer than I would have expected for a slow place. They didn't ask how I would like it cooked so it came well and I prefer my burgers medium-rare. It also says on the menu that it is topped with french fries. When the burger came it had 4 fries on it. There wasn't much of the chipotle ranch on it either so I had to add ketchup to the burger to give it some flavor.   I ordered a large side of fried pickles. They didn't have a ton of flavor and they were cooked inconsistently. Some were crispy and others were soggy. The portion size was huge and way to big for one person. That would be a good thing if they tasted good enough to eat. The one plus side is that they did have some local craft beer to drink.",

The place was dead yet our food still took 20+ minutes for a salad, some burgers and chicken tenders.   Our server was friendly and helpful and was really the saving grace for this place but I definitely won't be rushing back.   I had a buffalo chicken salad with grilled chicken  instead of fried. My order sat on the counter for 10 minutes before it was brought over. My husband had a burger and we shared a full order of fried pickles. It was huge but they were not enjoyable in the list. My friend had the sweet potato tots and they were delicious but a bit undercooked.   Originally I was leaning towards 3 stars but in retrospect I really would not recommend this peculiar place thus the 2 stars.",

I've tried a few of their burgers in the handful of times I've dined here (which should also say something, as I live within walking distance). The California Turkey Burger is fairly flavorful, sloppy with lots of toppings (not a bad thing!), and great when paired with either sweet potato tots or the sweet potato fries (balance out that healthy choice). The hubby typically gets the meatloaf burger and I've never had the opportunity to try it myself as he usually scarfs it down (again, another good sign).   Service is always friendly and attentive. This is a good spot to stop by en route to a Panthers game to grab a quick bite and/or to watch a game on one of the jumbo screens inside the restaurant, especially since there's a full bar.",

Sizable burger menu, but I was hankering for a hot dog.  Ended up getting a pimento cheese and bacon dog with fries.  I was pleased.  Nothing was wowing but there was a good slathering of pimento cheese on there with plenty of crumbled bacon.  Fries were under/not seasoned.  Sad!  I'm not sure what happened with my buddy's order but his order came out with chicken tenders and a bun.  I guess it was a DIY sandwich.    Ambiance and service was fine.  Nothing wrong here but may look for another place next time I'm in the area to mix things up.",

I had to add BBQ sauce to my burger because it was too dry when I asked for a medium. The bacon was good on the burger though .   One thing I can say is the tots with cheese (queso) was the best thing we had all night.   I have no desire to come here again unless every place around me is booked.    I believe in quality and paying a little extra for that too.  You can get a burger half the price with more quality across the street at Pinkys ....  Furthermore,  there is no real reason to go here.

I had a burger stuffed with jalapenos and Fritos, because I'm a nut, and it was pretty darn good. Could've used a bit more seasoning in the meat itself, but for $6? A solid burger. Don't go expecting a spiritual experience, but if you want a cool place to talk trash it fits the bill. My one complaint: their hours. Man, do they close early. I think 9 pm on weekdays and definitey before 11 weekends. I've gone by twice to be greeted by locked doors waaay before traditional closing time.",

(biggest pro!) ***(I was just informed they no longer do. So scratch that pro and move this review down to 2 stars)*** They offer a turkey and veggie burger. Tater tots are yummy!  Cons: The burgers are dry (I usually get the veggie burger and have to cover it in ketchup and mustard, and cheese.  No flavor.)  The meat burgers aren't much better. The service is slow and mess your order up more often than not if you don't repeat it to them multiple times. The location isn't near anything convenient besides the apartment I lived in.  I wouldn't make a trip for the food.  Now that I'm not in the area, I won't be going back.  The place overall is good, but nothing special, but the best place to go if you're in that area.",

We sat at the bar because we wanted to grab some drinks and watch a game.  The walk up counter is kind of confusing.  This seems like a place that should have full service.  They did have very good drink specials.  I got a Bell's Two Hearted for $3.50 and I believe the domestic tall boys were $2.  We started with the tater tot nachos.  They were good, but I've had a better take on potatoes smothered with chili and cheese before.  As for the burgers, I got the meatloaf burger and my girlfriend got the turkey burger.  The turkey burger was dry and tasteless, but I think ALL turkey burgers are like that so that's not really a knock on them.  My meatloaf burger had really great flavor and the meat was juicy.  It was topped with caramelized onions, cheese, BBQ sauce and a tangy mustard.  The bartender recommended it and I'm glad I took his advice.  The weird thing though was the patty was falling apart while I was eating it.  It wasn't that big of a deal, burger was still delicious.  The bartender was cool, very personable.  Overall, good experience, but we'll probably still be going to Pinky's when in the area.",

You walk up, order your food, and pay. They clean up after you leave. There was no waiting service that I experienced. I got my own refills, which seemed to be how the place was run, and I was just fine with that. The Burger Co. has a vast number of meats, toppings, and cheeses to choose from.  I chose the stuffed burger with corn chips, avocado, barbecue sauce, and provolone and shared the sweet potato tots with whipped cinnamon butter. For a place proclaiming to grind their burgers daily; I did not taste evidence of a freshly ground burger. The meat was dry and over-peppered. The tots were crisp and delicious especially when paired with the butter. However, there were a number of wines, martinis, and bottled beers to choose from.  Advertised drink specials were enticing even on the weekends. The restaurant is within walking distance of the Panthers stadium and the outside patio gives patrons a beautiful view of uptown. I'm not sure I would go back to the Burger Co. for a full meal but I could definitely see myself going back for a drink and an appetizer.",

I don't think it's a chain, but it look like it could be the first of many, not that that's a bad thing.  You order at a counter and they bring you food to your table.  I ordered the classic cheeseburger with the standard setup of lettuce, tomato, & pickle, along with a side of fries and a side of onion rings.  My food came out pretty quickly.  The burger and rings looked tasty, but the fries looked greasy and limp.  One bite of a fry confirmed it.  Minus one for the soggy fries.  The burger was juicy, but didn't have enough flavor for me.  The rings looked like they were frozen, not fresh made, but they were cooked crispy and had a good flavor anyway.  Don't know if it was a manager or just a guy clearing tables walked past and asked how everything was I mentioned that the fries were soggy.  He looked at them and said they looked bad as well and that he would get me a fresh batch.  He got a fresh basket of fries and brought them back to me.  These fries looked very good.  They were cooked crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Plus one for getting great tasting fries, so everything balanced out.  Later on the same gentleman came by and grabbed my empty baskets to clear my table and asked if I wanted a to go cup for my drink.  Nice touch for that.  Not the best burger place, but The Burger Company does a good job and the prices are very reasonable.  If I could give  1/2 stars I would give them 3  1/2",

Ive gone back several times because friends that live in the neighborhood like to patronize this establishment.  I attended the wilmore street festival a couple weeks ago, and all the resturants sold food, in booths. guess who ran out burger and company and the event was in their parking lot.  imagine that, others like open kitchen and pinkys set up temp kitchens in tents and the food flowed. its like they dont make the extra effort needed intodays business climate.    Last night I was invited to a birthday party there,  the party had been arranged with several meeting in person with the owner,  when the party planner showed up to start preperations she was met by the new manager and said we know nothing of your party or the fact there was a dj,  she did however know about the large food order that had been placed.  The party started and it was a very mild crowd of mainly older people who danced some, and just wanted to be with family and friends.  the bar service was teribbly slow, and finally the manager on duty very rudly shut the party down.  no effort was made on her behalf to make the event a sucess, it was already a very lucrative event for burger and company otherwise they would have been empty yet again on a sat night.  As I walked out the door,  and closed out my bar tab, that was the last one I will ever have in that establishemnt.  I will take my money elsewhere,  I felt like is was 1950 again in the way my african american friend were treated.  I was embarrassed to be white.  You need to look at the new mgr you just hired as she has cost you a ton of business in her first week. as I know of atleast 30 of your regular customers will not enter your doors again..",

However, The Burger Company has a veggie burger on the menu (as well as grilled cheese) and will make any of their special hamburgers with a veggie burger patty.  The outside patio along Morehead St. has a very good view of the Charlotte skyline.  It's nice sitting out there at night and staring at the downtown buildings.  There is also a picnic area in the entrance area complete with cornhole games.  The building itself is all brick and looks like it might have been a garage at one time and has tall ceilings and the floor plan is completely open.  They have a lot of micro brews in bottles and many on tap.  Service is very good.  You order your food near the kitchen and then sit down to have it delivered to your table.  There are a lot of TVs to watch games on and this place is a popular stopover for Panther's fans on their way to the stadium.  It will fill up here a few hours before home games.  A big plus here for me is the *covered* bike rack that is in the back of the building!  I would give The Burger Company 5 stars if they had a few more vegetarian items.",

Then it took me and my wife a couple of minutes to figure out what we wanted to eat. I am going to need to go back a couple of times to eat all of the different types of burgers. I do recommend any type of burger and make sure you choose to stuff it!! Also, before I forget, order the fried pickles and don't bother ordering a side to go with your burger with both the burger and fried pickles you will be set and will be nice and full... All in All, check it out definitely worth it!",

Atmosphere also was nice. We sat outside on one of their 2 patios.

This was from the manager, Mike.  Would've appreciated the heads up when we placed the order instead you took my order, so you should've made every effort to correct it and then been apologetic if you messed up, which he was not.  Also, FYI, he said they don't give refunds for cash, only a credit card.

    "text": "Remember standing in the lunch line at elementary school back in the day?  Lined up around the wall with classmates, some of whom you know, some of whom you hoped wouldn't come near you?  I was recently transported back to those days with my lunch trip to Burger Co., only it was going to take quite a bit more than a pocketful of quarters to pay my bill.  What's to love: -Big selection of burgers, some stuffed with cheese, others with a number of toppings both traditional and more inventive (buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese chunks with minced celery??).  Also hot dogs and salads available. -Sides you don't see everywhere.  For example, tater tots both regular and in sweet potato.   -Full bar and big beer selection- both micro and macro brews with a few daily specials. -Cool space, big windows and tall ceilings with some old-school Charlotte theme for the art and signage on the walls.  What's to not love: -Burgers are at least $5 and do not include a side at all. -The line gets long.  My co-worker and I waited more than 15 minutes to get to the front of the line.  They have 2 registers but obviously did not feel the need to move worker onto the second machine.  For a lunch rush in the shadow of uptown, this is plain unacceptable. -No wait service.  Your order comes with a number you put on the table.  A couple runners will bring your basket of food out to you. - The lunch line winds around the lone soft drink station.  Since it's self-service I had to ask folks to move just so I could get myself a refill.  So I consider a 2-star review kind of harsh, but here's what I can't get over.  For the same money, you can go across the street (Pinky's) or down the road (Big Daddy's) and have about the same food for about the same price BUT you don't have to wait in line.  Nothing at Burger Co. was worth a return to my days of standing in the lunch line.",

For such a dining experience at The Penguin that's expected. That Charlotte institution's diviness & grit are part of its charm. But Burger Co. has nice wooden tables & chairs, flat panel TVs galore, and obvious effort put into it's decor. For the operational cost cutting to be present in such an obvious way it is an off note.  Unfortunately this night they were out of the sweet potato fries ($2.50) & the waitress confirmed their tater tots are frozen in contrast to the freshly ground burgers. So how was it? The Buffalo Burger ($5) of buffalo wing sauce, bleu cheese, celery strips is a novel flavor combination & a differentiator from Burger Co's rivals. They were other such options available on the menu. The burger arrived perfectly hot with a soft warm bun. The meat was good though plain & a nice thickness that isn't skimping nor requiring genetics of an anaconda. Generally Burger Co. is a good tasty meal & a welcome addition to the west end but it doesn't feel much different than stopping at Cook Out on the way home.",

You order your own burger at the counter and then they bring it to you at your table of choice, kind of like ordering at McAlister's Deli.  I wish Mac's Speed Shop did it this way.  It has a really cool bar area.  Like a lower-key Twisted Spoke if you've been to one in Chicago.  If it were in a slightly different area I'd expect it to be more of a biker bar.  They have a huge parking lot and even a covered bicycle rack which is more considerate than most  places.  And the spanking new juke box looks like it hasn't been put to much use yet.  The food is a step up from Burger King in taste.  Twice the cost of fast food but still half the price of a restaurant like Big Daddy's or The Counter.  So for value and atmosphere it's great.  A fine place to score a quick meal and go about the rest of your day.  It's a family burger joint with hot dogs and a kids menu, and a casual sports bar rolled into one.",

    "text": "A place called \"The Burger Company\" should have amazing burgers. That said, I've tried this place twice and I'm not impressed. The burger was mediocre at best. The fries were easily the worst I've had in a long time. Border-line cold and soggy, like they were under cooked and then sat there for hours under a luke-warm heat lamp.  I've read some of the other ratings for this place, and the city council stuff bothers me, but I tried to base my rating on the food alone.  Either way, if you want a burger and fries, Pinky's across the street is a much better bet, and if you're up for a drive, Bad Daddy's in Dilworth blows the doors off this place.",

I have always thought that I made the best pimento cheese on earth(Magnolias recipe) but this is better -- at least on a burger. The fried puxkes are at least \"Penguin quality \". Others lived all burgers as well as the \"man salad\" and sweet potato tots. Fresh ground beef and bread make this excellent!",

I went with the BYOB, and the (chicken) burger was decent but the fries fell flat (go with the tots). Our bartender wasn't very welcoming/social but she did improve as the night went on. Overall not the greatest experience but I may eventually give this place another try.",

    "text": "Finally made it out to this place last Saturday for a quick pit stop and to kill some time.  I really wish I could have stayed longer!  First off, Bell's Two Hearted Ale on tap....I was sold right then and there.  Beyond that, it's a cool spot.  You order your food at the register, grab a number and they bring it out.  I will say that if you want more beer you have to go inside and serve yourself basically.  Not a huge deal for me.  The food was fantastic, mostly bar grub, but the tots were great and the hot dog was just fantastic!    Great place for kiddo's too!",

It really was disappointing because the interior looks great, but the service, management, and food was terrible.  Burgers took way too long, they were way overcooked, our fries were cold and had to be sent back, and our server had no idea what he was doing.  No way I go back to this place.",

    "text": "I told my boyfriend about this place and we decided to give it a try. I told him I wanted a good burger. So we went here to try it out.  I'm glad we did because the burgers were great! They had all types of choices to choose from and you could also get a stuffed burger with cheese. I decided to go with the Meatloaf Burger. My boyfriend got a Make Your Own Stuffed Burger. My burger was seasoned very well and cooked to my perfection. The burgers tasted like they were taken off the grill from a cookout, but wayyyy better. My boyfriend let me get a bite of his Stuffed Burger with cheese, and it was great. We got some of their fried pickles to taste and they were good as well. Not the best I have had, but decent.   You have to get fries or tots on the side as an extra cost. Which was about $1.50. I got the tots and you could get sweet potato tots or fries as well which was pretty cool. Overall this place has great burgers and I would definitely go back.",

I know a car wash around the corner (Freedom & Morehead) that used to detail thier cars... Actually it was a Car Shop, African bodega, and Chinese bodega (right beside each other).  Now only leaving the last \"store front\" to the right (Looking at the BC from Morehead) open for the next venture.   The way it looks (all the way down to the Parking Lot) now is 180 degrees different from say 3-5 years ago.",

    "text": "I've passed this place many times and each time I've made a mental note to try it.  Well today, I finally did and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the meatloaf burger with pepper jack cheese (caramelized onions, bacon, mustard BBQ sauce) - yum! I don't think I've EVER had a burger more delicious than this one.  It was ooey, gooey, and messy -- 3 requirements for a delicious burger! My side order of tater tots were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - perfect! My companion had a stuffed burger (can't remember which one because I was too focused on devouring my own burger) and he also loved it.  I would definitely recommend trying this place and I plan to return.  However, be aware that prices do not include the side. The $6.75 that I paid was only for the burger - the tater tots were separate. Also, my companion's fries tasted strongly of peanuts.  I'm assuming it was from the oil they used to fry them, but we've never had fries that tasted so strongly of the oil.  So, we dipped them in ketchup. Presto! Problem solved. So again, I would strongly recommend this restaurant if you love burgers. Enjoy!",
