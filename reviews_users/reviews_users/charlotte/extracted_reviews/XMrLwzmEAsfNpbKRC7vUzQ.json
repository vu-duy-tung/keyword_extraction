Sure, you get a pint glass on Thursday if you come at the right time, but a discounted brew of the day would go a long way for making me return more than once a year.   My roasted wings were actually pretty good, although the Three Mile Island roasted was not very hot...not sure if it is just because they were roasted or that the sauce just wasn't very hot. It turned out to be delicious, but i was actually looking for more burn on this night.   Service was fine, although i would've ordered a 2nd beer, but she never looked my way or offered before offering the check. i would think a place with this much beer would expect someone to have more than one beer or at least offer.   Definitely a great spot for sports. Sat in a booth and while you have one tv directly above the people across from you, the tvs are situated perfectly where you can watch the tv at the next booth as well. If those don't have what you want, turn to your left or right and it will probably be on there.",

We ordered drinks and my gram's sweet tea was awful, it wasn't even unsweetened iced tea, it was watery and gross. The server did take it back and brought her a new one a few minutes later that was much better. My mother ordered a mixed drink that didn't come out as described but the server was quick to replace and did not charge for it. I was surprised that they did not have any happy hour specials. We all ordered our food and everyone was happy with it. You also get a good quantity of food for the price. Overall an alright visit, might go again but wouldn't go out of my way.",

The wings were good too.  I think they are better than the two wing places in the area (buffalo wild wings or wild wing cafe).  However, the habanero BBQ were not that hot for being second hottest wing.  Also, hot, medium, and mild just mean how much sauce they put on the wings so I recommend getting hot.    Taco Mac has a wonderful beer selection that is a little pricy.   More TV's than anywhere.",

I believe that several of the other reviewers are correct that it has a lot to do with the proximety to UNCC.   If your party has more than four people, there are better options in the area.  The beer selection is awesome, riveling only the flying saucer in the area.  The food is mediocre at best, incidently it seems better and bigger portions at the south Charlotte location.

Also, there is a plethora of drink options- from a large assortment of beer options to several soft drink combinations containing your choice of flavored syrup.   Another great quality of Taco Mac is it's operating hours, as it stays open pretty late. The only complaint I have  is the speed of service. In the evening, service is extremely slow.

Once I got over the set-up, I started to concentrate on what I was paying for!!! I started off with chips, salsa and queso. That was not cheese!!! The queso was like glue and difficult to swallow. I had to take a drink of water to wash it down. The wings were the worse I ever had. They were undercooked and also naked. They were suppose to be buffalo wings(3 mile sauce). The celery was wilted. My waiter(Wes) was good but the food sucked. I am not a beer drinker but maybe if I was, it would have tricked me into not thinking about the food like the TV's did at first!!!",

Bartenders: (ALL of them are friendly and quick to serve. Shout out to Tyler especially. I love them all, but in a city where the majority of bartenders are female, it's cool to have a make bartender who is quick witted and fast at pouring a beer. I've also been told by my female friends he is hot. I personally think he looks like Richard Jefferson formerly of the Brooklyn Nets).  Loyalty Program: (You get cool stuff for drinking. I like cool stuff. I also like drinking).  Certain Foods: Buffalo Hummus especially.   CONS: Wing Sauce \"Heat\": I wish they had a sauce that was REALLY HOT. Their sauces have taste but PLEASE get one with MORE HEAT.  Bathroom: It doesn't have any pictures of 1970's pinup babes. I know that's being picky, but if I'm going to be in it 30 times a month, I want pictures in the men's room.  Phone Ring: Their incoming phone ring tone is quite annoying. Not....even....kidding.  All in all, I will be going there regularly. If you like trying different beers with sports on multiple TV's run to this restaurant. If you are  a blind Amish recovering alcoholic, I recommend somewhere else.",

The ranch and blue cheese cups for dipping had maybe a teaspoon each. We had to ask for more and even then that wouldn't have filled even one dipping cup. The hot buffalo sauce was definitely not hot and frankly tasted like BBQ sauce, which we did not order. Also, now the food comes in paper buckets. What is up with that? If I am paying a premium for wings, I would like a plate. I'm not at KFC. Overall, it was highly disappointing and I doubt I will return.",

We saw MANY empty tables but still waited. Finally at the 45 minute mark, we were ready to leave. Our table was ready (one of the many we had seen) right then so we decided to stay. Darien explained to us that there were only 3 servers in a packed house tonight and that he appreciated our patience. From that point on, it was excellent! He took very good care of us, in spite of being run ragged, and the food (most of us had wings) was delicious. Mis-management is the only reason this review is not 5 star.",

    "text": "The story goes that 2 guys on their way from Buffalo to FL, stopped in Atlanta and opened a restaurant with wings, etc.  After the server told me the standard Buffalo wings were breaded first, I have to ask.......we're they thrown out of Buffalo, or did they leave voluntarily? My recommendations: 1.  Buffalo wings are made by deep frying the wings until crispy, then tossed in a mixture of butter, garlic and hot sauce. 2.  When someone asks for \"Hot Buffalo Wings, they should actually taste like buffalo wings, and have some measure of heat. 3.  Your iced tea should be refreshed with ice if it is melted within 2 minutes of hitting the table, and refilled within a half hour of having only a quarter inch left in the glass. 4.  If you have run out of spoons, don't just deliver the bowl of chili without one and wait until it is cold to come back-then deliver a plastic spoon 5 minutes after. 5.  On Sunday afternoon, instead of having Euro league basketball on all TV'S but 1 (and the other had bowling), maybe you could tune in a baseball game or 2, the NASCAR race, or even a real NBA game on a few screens.  Just a few suggestions to make your next 1st time visitor come back.  This 1st time visitor won't be back.",

The food is okay at best.... Nothing memorable.. But there are plenty of TVs and space if you are looking to catch a game that is out of network. There are a TON of beers on tap.. So many that it may be tough to narrow down your choice unless you're a beer connoisseur.  Only come here if I have to..",

A friend and I decided we wanted to try Taco Mac since we have heard so much about it, BUT I wish we never walked into this place. First off, our server took forever to get to us and we watched them stand around and talk. Once we were greeted, we asked about the tacos and any specials. Our server simply said \"Everything here is great, you can see the taco choices in your menu.\" WHAT?!?!?! We clearly asked for some form of advice as to what we should order! After getting our drinks, we ordered wings and tacos in hopes that the food would make up for the lack of service. Unfortunately, that was not the case! Our tacos were wrong and we asked for all flats for our wings and of course we didn't get all flats. We were hoping our server would come back and check on us so we could correct the issue, but we didn't get that chance. So we ate what we had and left TOTALLY DISSATISFIED!!!! A piece of advice for management, come by and touch your tables!!!!! Get better servers, who actually care about what their job!!!! Even after sharing our horror story with our hotel, they still insist that we give them another chance. I'm sorry, I refuse to pay for service like that and to receive the wrong food!!!",

The Good: Huge Beer Selection (200+) Lots of TV's (more TV's than what a Best Buy would have on display) Lot's of seating (at the bar, booths, tall tables)  The Ok stuff: The food. I understand it's a sports bar, but its just ok. It's not awful, its not amazing. I will try to go back and try there wings -- the waitress did say that it was the most popular item on the menu (again, a sports bar so I'm not surprised)  The bad: The service was a bit slow. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, an hour and a half went by. We didn't order appetizers and she took down our drink and food order as soon as we sat down. I don't consider myself a very needy customer but after taking our order, we didn't see her again until she came back asking if we would like our check. There was numerous times where we could of used napkins, refills, etc.  Anyways, I would 100% come back here to watch a sporting event as the place did have an awesome set up for that. As far as coming here for a good \"dining experience\", I would have to pass.  I'm giving this place 4 stars because you need to review places based off what they actually are. Like my friend Paul says \"it's all relative\". This place is a sports bar, and that's exactly what you get. A GREAT bar, with OK food.",

Receipt indicates we paid at 5:41pm and we received food at 5:50pm. By this time, we were already annoyed. No more than 10 people in the restaurant. thank gawd for the countless tvs to keep us entertained while we awaited aimlessly, with no apology for the late food delivery.   Come home looking forward to the wings. open boxes. The number of celery sticks included was about 8, with the skimpy small pieces which were not even crisp. I thought you are supposed to receive celery proportional to the order placed?!?! cost savings maybe. Proceeded to eat the lemon pepper, with no flavor of lemon nor pepper whatsoever. 6 people around the table compared the plain vs lemon pepper and all concurred they were the same flavor. Mild tasted more like someone mixed hotsauce and splenda together.   Overly hyped, poor food, poor customer service.   Maybe we missed the True chef since it was new years eve, but damn. that was some nasty crap.",

Last nights visit was to the university area. The service was slow but everything was going good until the bill came. Everyone watch your bills, I had a beer that was $2.75 more than the menu price and another that was .50 cents higher. A friend was ripped off $1.25, and a couple other at my table had drink prices charged to their card that was different then their super beer menu indicated.

And also, be warned the floors are very slippery so when you come in don't run!  My friends ordered food and I'm going off of their reactions to the food. They ordered a bacon burger, chicken caesar wrap, and a chocolate chimi. The reactions were that even though the entrees were good, they weren't worth it because they didn't get full! However the desserts had better reactions and this is what they said: \"it was bangin.\"  My friend who also ordered the wrap also said that when you see on the menu the fresh fruit for sides, they meant apple slices not extravagant all types of fruit to eat.  Overall, it's not bad yet it's not amazing. Prices aren't ridiculous but they could be a little better.",

Suggestions to attempt to stay open: 1- use a clean towel to wipe down tables 2- train your wait staff to listen and smile 3- check the lighting, dark dining in a sports bar is not recommended 4- if in the event a customer has a legitimate concern, and you are the manager, don't catch an attitude with the customer.  5- have the staff take a few classes in customer service, have the manager take a lot of classes.

That said, this place is still waaaaay better than Bikini's next door.  Wheres the tacos and wheres the mac?  OK, they do have some Taco's, but nothing special by any means.  Tried them on a prior occasion.  I really didn't see any mac though.  They did have Highland cold mountain, which was the reason I was there.  After it took a good 20 minutes for us to get our 2 beers that we ordered the second we sat down.  Apparently because it took the entire bar staff to make one chick a chocolate martini.  I then realized I wouldn't be ordering much food here.  Six wings for about $7.  Not that great of a deal.  They were above average in flavor and texture, but that's all I can really say.  Oh yeah, hot wasn't hot, its more like mild.  We asked for our tab and that took quite a while as well.  I probably should have ordered another beer for the wait.  Good strategy to up sell guys.  Not impressed, no way the one near Duckworth's in Huntersville stays in business very long.  This one might do alright considering the other options around it but real beer drinkers will be at the Flying Saucer.",

Idiotic response blaming Grub Hub- that they grabbed the wrong bag off the bar. I asked for the General Manager - Jason is the name I received. He was the most unprofessional GM I have ever interacted with. Continuing to blame the delivery service for the error and rudely stating he canceled my order and refunded the money back to Grub Hub. I didn't ask for a refund Captain Obvious- I asked for my tacos. Don't you worry- I will NEVER order from this establishment again. It is very unnerving that to-go orders are placed at the bar for any random person to come in and grab, go through and potentially tamper with food. Hopefully someone above this individual will get a clue before your business is driven into the ground. You see word of mouth is the best and worst form of advertisement. DON'T SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS THAT IS OKAY WITH DELIVERING HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.",

Food came out in a reasonable time and was great but by this time our beers were empty and our server was no where to be found. I had to walk up to the bar to ask for 2 glasses of water. Ended up having to flag another server down for our bill. I noticed what seemed to be a manager sitting at a bar table against the wall on his cell phone for the majority of our visit.

    "text": "My wife and I were riding around looking for a place to grab some food last night. We stumbled upon Taco Mac by mistake while turning around. I was never aware of this place being stuck back here. The parking lot was full of cars, so I gave into my curiosity and talked my wife into giving it a shot with me.   Upon walking it, it has a sports bar vibe. Lots of TVs, a great looking bar and tables full of people. When I say lots of TVs, I mean more TVs than I've ever seen in one building outside of an electronics store. Seems like there is a TV for each person to watch. I didn't mind it at all, I love watching sports while eating.   My wife and I both went with the boneless wings. I was curious about the death flavor, but we stuck with hot. The wings were good, a bit bready, but overall tasty. One part that caught me off guard was the homemade dressings. The ranch was really thick and creamy, I enjoyed the flavor though. We had fries with the wings and they were hot and tasted good as well.   One thing I really enjoyed about this place is the beer selection, our server explained the beer club to us and that sounded pretty cool. I sampled a few local brews ( I can't recall the names ) and they went down smooth. My wife was driving so she had sweet tea.   For our first experience here, it was overall a very good time. The service was nice and quick. The food was hot and fresh, and the prices weren't too bad. I would recommend this place to anyone in the University area looking to try something new. It's worth a shot, I know we will come back to try out some other menu options.   ( While filling out the additional survey options for this place, one of the options was Has TV:  I had to laugh out loud at this one. )",

If it was not for the incredible  beer list and amazing amount of TV sports I would not come here at all.   I ordered the wings which they tout as their specialty. I can name several spots in the area that are much better. They were big and meaty for sure.  However they were just fried and thrown in a basket. Not tossed in the sauce at all. There was a microscopic squirt of sauce in the side of the basket. Even if I wanted to dunk the wings in the sauce myself i could not because there was not enough of it. Just terrible.   Lastly the bar tenders are brain dead. All of them. The personality of a log.   Thank heaven for the beer.",

    "text": "Ok, I'm going to preface this review with the caveat that I am both a beer snob and a football junky.  Went here last Sunday for football.  This was my second time here but had just gone in for a quick lunch the first time so wasn't really paying enough attention to review.  The first impression when you enter this place with the intent of watching football is that you have found paradise.  There must be 100 HD tv's in this place.  From my vantage point, other than the men's room, you're about 8 feet away from 3 tv's at any given point in this place!  We sat at one of the high top islands that had taps built in.  There was a cluster of 4 tvs directly above us, and they'll tune the tv at your table to whichever game you prefer.  The taps at the table are a little gimmicky, IMO, but a cool touch nonetheless.    The beer menu here is extensive.  I'm not sure exactly how many beers they serve here but it must be over 100.  Prices for the beer were reasonable too.  The food that I had was just ok.  I ordered wings (what else do you eat while drinking beer and watching football?).  They were actually a decent size and cooked well, but my problem is with the \"sauce\" or lack thereof.  They pretty much didn't have any.  If you like sauced wings, I suggest you order extra sauce on the side.    The service at my table was great.  The waitress was friendly and came to our table at just the right intervals.    Overall, I prefer the Flying Saucer for hanging out with friends and drinking some cold beers, but for Sunday football, Taco Mac is tough to beat.  I do also like the Three Monkeys in Harrisburg for football, but sometimes they struggle with the big football crowd.  Taco Mac seemed to have no problem handling the larger crowd.  I will definitely go back for another football Sunday.",

Staff is very friendly and fast - I went for a work-day lunch but you can tell these guys and gals can handle the crowds.

    "text": "I visited this place randomly as the first restaurant my party was interested in going to was a bit too crowded.  I hadn't read the reviews, but I had always heard talk of this place while attending school, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  When I first walked in, a nice fella had opened the door for us.  When we went to see the hostess, they were nice with seating us, but they weren't as friendly as hostess' usually are, so that's fine.  The service with our waiter was great though.  I say kudos to him.  Service is very important to me, and he was always spot on with that.  He also seemed very knowledgeable of the menu and the beers included.  He was always pleasant checking up on us the whole time we were there.  The atmosphere was very chill.  I thought that the restaurant was laid out pretty well.  There is definitely not shortage of TV's, let me tell you that!  Everywhere I turned, I was always able to have a TV in sight.  Not bad if I were a huge sport fanatic.  The booth that I was in felt very comfortable.  It was a big booth, so I liked that I had a lot of elbow room to eat.  Now the food, it wasn't the best food that I've had.  I feel like I could have had better food eating at home.  The chips and queso that we had ordered for an appetizer made me a little sad.  I just love queso, and this just didn't hit the right note for me.  The cheese felt like it wasn't melted that great, so after about 2 minutes, it started getting hard to dip.  I had ordered the Burrito Mac and wasn't very pleased with it.  It didn't really have that much flavor, that umph!  The only thing that I did really enjoy from my plate were my fries.  Sad, but True.  Maybe I just wasn't feeling it that night.    I don't think that I would go back here unless friends really insist on going here for lunch or dinner.  Maybe if I end up going another time months from now, my opinion will change, but I hope they will still have the same waiter.",

I feel like a place called Taco Mac should at least serve up some decent taco options. 5 taco options that come only on soft flour torts warrants a name change. Anywho, as some may know...this place is way more of a sports bar than any sort of hub for Mexican or even Tex-Mex (I didn't). Perhaps that's why it's \"T.Mac\" on the building. Pros: they were open after the show we attended (got there at 12:30a), our server was very kind and attentive, andddd they serve food. Was this food the worst I've ever had? Maybe not, but my husbands chicken ranch wrap WAS the worst wrap he said he's ever had. He said he wasn't even sure there was actually ranch in it-dry and flavorless. I was hell-bent on some sort of Mexican but with no corn torts, not much adhered to my current dietary restrictions. I ended up getting chicken fajitas and just eating it sort of like a salad/bowl. The chicken was flavorless and kind of dry, onions and peppers are hard to mess up, the black beans were more like chili? My Abuela would have pitched a fit. I kind of pitched a fit (in my head, of course). The guac was amazing compared to the rest of our meal. I would not recommend this place or return.",

    "text": "Came here for their 35 cent beers night, wish I had just stayed home. To be fair, I showed up at midnight so I expected a crowd, but it seems like they offered this great deal but weren't prepared and weren't really able to deliver. My friend and I went to the bar, which was packed with people, but there were only three bartenders so we couldn't get served. After about 10 minutes I asked one of the bartenders for an Angry Orchard draft and was told they were out of them. After that, we decided to just sit at a table and try to order food. After a good five minutes of sitting, no server, so I told the hostess we had not been served. When our server came over, my friend ordered a shock top and I asked for a margarita, she said their blender was broken. Before I could open my mouth to ask for anything else, the server just walked away and went to another table, so that annoyed me. When she finally came back, I asked for an Angry Orchard bottle. The bartenders then started walking around saying it was last call even though it was only 1am and they closed at 2am. It would've been nice if they had told us this when we walked in. My friend and I asked our server if she could bring us two of the drinks we ordered since it was last call, she said she couldn't. After she brought our drinks, she put them down and walked away, not even a \"do y'all need anything else\", so I decided not to give her any more business and didn't get food. I then went to the bar to try and get another drink myself. My server cornered me at the bar and asked what she could get me, I said I was getting another drink. She said \"oh, I can get that for you.\" I was baffled, she had just told me she couldn't do it, and seemed like she was annoyed that I had gone to the bar. After about 3 minutes she came back and said they didn't have any more of my drink so I was extremely annoyed. While all this is going on and the restaurant is complete chaos, the manager was chatting it up with his buddy, didn't even walk around and ask guests how everything was.   I have been a server before and have no problem tipping well and cutting slack because I know how hectic the job is, but our server was extremely lackluster and didn't seem to care at all. The management was no help and the whole situation was unorganized. I've never had their food, but I don't plan on going back to try any. I wish I could give this place zero stars.",

A few minutes later she came around and went to seat us in the dining area, we asked if we could sit in the bar table area instead, and she make it seem like an inconvenience to make such a request. Once we were seated, it was another 5 minutes before someone came to our table. We ordered our beers and food and were left again until someone else dropped off our food. The Cobb salad I ordered consisted of lettuce, a few strips of chicken, a single grape tomato and brown avocado. There were several parts of the chicken that were inedible. Our beer glasses were empty shortly after receiving our food, yet the waitress never came over to check and see if we wanted more. She only appeared to give the check before we asked for it, instead of asking if we wanted anything else. We came in expecting a few beers and a good lunch, we were very disappointed with what we got. I could accept bad service if it was busy, but we were 2 of the 15 people in the restaurant. No one was friendly,helpful or attentive. I used to be a fan of and frequent this establishment, but the declining service makes me not want to return.",

You need to bring in in food, service and atmosphere and I hate to say it but they just don't. The place is loud. Not bustling, not \"a little noisy\". LOUD NOISES, loud. The staff is not unpleasant by any means, but they don't wow me with either their personality or awareness.  I do have to say that the Queso Poblano was tasty and definitely an appetizer for 2. I would also be remiss to completely gloss over the beer list. It is massive. Bottles, drafts, big beers, lighter beers, probably even Light beers (but I really didn't check). It's all there and it's all decently priced. For me though, there are are too many better places in town to grab a good beer to make Taco Mac a regular watering hole.",

We've always been able to walk right in and get a good seat in front of many Tv's. The food is pretty good too.  I've had a burger with sweet potato fries and one of their shrimp wraps. Both were above average in my opinion for sports bar food.   The wait staff has always been really friendly and attentive as well. I was a little bummed though when I visited a few months back that they wouldn't show the UFC fight because they are a family oriented sports bar. I get it but was really hoping to see the fight since I knew one of the guys fighting. All in all taco mac is well worth a check in or two.",

I went with a friend on Friday night and we had an excellent experience overall.  A little strangely, the hostess sat us in the back room where there was not anyone else. It was quite loud in the front of the restaurant though, so it ended up being for the best. The back room did start to fill up as the time passed.  The waitress, unfortunately I do not remember her name, was very attentive. She checked on us often. And she let us know about joining the beer club, which was great because then the queso that we had ordered was free.  The queso was as tasty as I remember. I got the fried chicken, cheese, and mushroom sandwich, which was quite large. I definitely took leftovers home.  The only thing that bothered me a little bit was that they did not bring the honey mustard listed on the menu when they brought my meal. When I asked the waitress \"Doesn't this come with honey mustard?\", she said \"I could bring you some.\"  It was not a big deal, but her response turned me off some because I checked the menu again and they had made the mistake of not bringing the honey mustard, which she did not acknowledge by apologizing. But again, it was only a little thing.",

I was hoping that this most recent visit would prove that the Taco Mac in the university area had changed.  NOPE! The service was terrible, at no fault to the wait staff they are spread too thin.  We had arrived and waited 5 to 10 minutes until our friendly server should see us.  Ordered waters and a few beers.  Our waters were brought to us but waited about 15 to 20 minutes on the beers.  We ordered our food and chatted.  My father had finished his beer and ordered another as our food was served 15 to 20 minutes later.  After he had finished his meal he was still waiting on his beer.  He told the waiter to not worry about the beer it was to late now, and the waiter said he understood and he was sorry about that.  Eventually the manager came over with the beer and gave it on the house.  My father explained to him that there was poor service due to no fault of our waiter.  I honestly hope Taco Mac management see this, and potential customers.  I walked in to five hostesses waiting to seat people.  Two waiters that's also bussed tables. One bartender. And one manager, that when he was told there was poor services explained to us that millenials were lazy and it was hard to find good workers.  This location  is surrounded by office parks, they serve a large variety of good beer and have okay food.  But they are always empty.  It's beacaue of poor service not due to servers fault but due to servers being understaffed.  I joked that our server cooked our meal and that's why it all took so long, but now I'm wondering if that's the case.",

    "text": "We were thrilled when Taco Mac came to Charlotte. However, we ate at the University location twice. The service was horrible. The food was greasy. The second trip was in response to a complaint that we called in to the restaurant. Even then, nothing improved. It is real sad to see the Taco Mac of the 1980s is now gone. The present day, cookie-cutter Taco Mac is just pathetic.  Addendum:  As you can see, my review was responded to by one of their staff.  Well, I think it is all an empty gesture.  Avoid the Taco Mac of today.  It is NOTHING like the ones that used to be scattered around Atlanta in the 1980's.  As for the response from Taco Mac, I see lots of them from the staff of Taco Mac on various reviews.  So, here's some food for thought:  1 -  Our second visit was because of a poor, disgusting visit the first time.  It was VERY apparent NOTHING had changed between the two visits.  Why would I accept a second comp visit only to rack up a THIRD horrible experience?  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, shame on you.  Fool me a third time, I am just a f*****g idiot for going back again.  2 -  Instead of posting, \"gee, we are sorry\" comments, HOW ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEMS YOUR CHARLOTTE LOCATIONS SEEM TO HAVE?????  The Huntersville location has already closed.  It should only be a matter of time before the University and South Park locations likewise close.  I work in customer service myself, and I have to say that your responses and comp trips are USELESS unless you FIX THE PROBLEMS!!!",

Another waiter came over that recognized us from his previous job, he brought my friend her ranch and took some fries off my plate.

It's wing joint. We didn't get the wings... we started off spending 15 minutes going over the beer menu...105 beers in bottles and another 100 on draft. After a few samples we turned our attentions to the food. Nice choices from salads to burgers. Heather our waitress was outstanding. The burgers were the best burgers we have had in a longtime. If you like a laid back beerfest this is the place for you. We will be back next week!!",

One complaint, the parking spaces are the smallest I've ever seen, you better not go there in a monster truck, think I'll take the Mini next time.  Place was packed and we were told a twenty minute wait. I was sorta glad to see that business seems to be doing well cause that part of town has had several  restaurants go under recently.  Anyway, we got a table after about 15 minutes. Oh, wow, this place has more TVs that anyplace I've ever been in  its sorta neat to try and take it all in. IMHO they've done a great job remodeling a old steakhouse. Anyway service was outstanding(I think I gave our waiter about a 30% tip.  He was that good)  The food was outstanding, the wings were the BEST I've ever had. And the beer was great.  And I thought prices were very reasonable.  We'll diffidently be back.  Certainly makes my list of top 10 restaurants to go to.",

It was a big messy heap that looked like it belonged in a trough.  The chef obviously did not care about presentation.  The chef stuck the salsa in a slant on the side of this heap of mess which resulted in it all tumbling down on my clothing.  The server appeared to find this humorous and brought over a dish towel and seltzer water.  No offer to clean the mess, replace it or comp the meal which I was wearing.  I guess the chef didn't get the memo about you putting sauces on a separate dish and not cramming it in the side.  The manager came over only after we requested and offered to pay the dry cleaning ONLY.  I WILL DEFINITELY PASS ON THIS PLACE WHEN IM VISITING THE AREA.",

    "text": "Where do I begin!!!! We drove from Asheville, fished in the sun all day at Lake Norman. Drank a few beers but nothing crazy. Then went back to the hotel to Uber to a concert. On the way my friend found out his dog has cancer. I love that dog!!!! Don't worry I'm getting to the review of Taco Mac - you need the back story.... We got to the concert via Uber because we figured we would drink & I would never drink & drive! Well once we got there neither of us were in the mood to drink surprisingly. We both drank at least 4 big Diet Pepsi's from 7-10pm between the 2 of us.  We leave early because I can't stop crying all night & we were both tired from the drive & being in the sun all day fishing then the concert - we are both in our mid to late 40's, not kids anymore.  We arrive back at our hotel that is 0.1 miles from Taco Mac. We decide to have some food if they are open & have a beer before bed. So I drive over there. There are roughly 5 employees at the hostess desk when we arrive just standing there. We go and sit in the bar area. Then shortly after Richard who I can only guess is a manager of some sort comes to the table & asks questions the 1st one being did you drive or Uber? Did you go to the concert? I thought it went to 11? ( it was like 10:45 ) Have you ever been here before?  This bothered me. I've worked in the  the restaurant industry for over 20 years I knew what he was getting at / doing. Now I wouldn't mind but we showed no signs of drinking. If he was checking for being old, tired & sad yes - drunk no!!!!! My last beer was at 5:00pm almost 6 hours prior. I was so bothered so my friend asked him why he asked us that - he said he can tell that we've been drinking and it was his years of bar experience that lead him to that conclusion. We did not correct him because in reality we had been drinking that day just not currently. So we ate & left - oh I had a beer too, a sour that was flat.  And the food wasn't good either - we ordered fried wings with dry rub. They were not dry rubbed - they were fried & seasoned after. Not sure how but not dry rubbed. It was a dry rub but not executed properly ( again I do have 20 actually 30 years Restaurant experience) Wings sucked!!!! Service sucked!!!! Customer Service sucks at this place for sure - took forever to get our food & drinks while the bartender was eating wings behind the bar &  washing glasses as we waited for our drinks then one of the beers they didn't have the keg was kicked. So my friend didn't even drink!!!  Richard was totally off base & out of line. I don't think his past restaurant experience lead him in the right direction tonight. I will never go there again! It was an awful - he was awful! Servers were sub par so the experience all together sucked!",

I visited Saturday and was waited on by Trevor, who was nice, knowledgeable, and gave his True opinion about different dishes, as I was debating between a burger and tacos. I went with his recommendation and got the tacos, fajita steak; fajita chicken, and mango shrimp. Each was good, but I think the steak and shrimp were better than the chicken because I expected the chicken to have more of a char grilled taste.  My friend had the Garlic Parmesan wings, which were delicious. Make sure you ask for them to be charred so they have more flavor.   This is a pretty well oiled machine and they do a great job handling high traffic.",

The staff was nice and kept up with my water guzzling ways--pretty much my only requirement. The wings were pretty good, though I think the dry rubs were probably my favorite, because the outside was crispy. Pretty standard wings, pretty standard flavors. What we did enjoy was the beer selection. Found a sour that I really like there, which I later bought a 6-pack of at a beer shop in Durham. The Dragon's Milk is also pretty good and it was a part of a pretty decent stout flight. That's what brought an otherwise 3-stars up to a 4. I'm always happy at a place with solid beers.",

We had excellent attentive service for our whole visit.   We ordered the guacamole appetizer which was fresh and tasty. The salsa had a good little kick to it. I ordered the buffalo chicken tenders and the broccoli queso casserole. If I ever want to test out a new restaurant to me, I will order something that I think can make or break a visit, buffalo tenders or a burger. Staples of traditional American bar food. If a restaurant can't cook either well, I'm not impressed.   Their tenders were the real deal. All white meat, juicy and their hot sauce was the perfect amount of heat. I love some spicy food and they did those right. The casserole was amazing! Just like you'd want a broccoli queso casserole, cheesy and gooey.   My daughter ordered their black bean burger and she devoured it, saying it was one of the best she's had. My husband ordered the chicken quesadilla and also agreed that it was equally tasty.   For traditional bar food, they do it right. We were not disappointed and would enjoy another visit if we were in Charlotte again.",

While that might seem like something a lazy person might say, it's important when you want to keep up with your fantasy football or of you want to watch baseball and football. The food is really good. I got a regular burger and it was pretty good. I also tasted the honey Chipotle wings and they where good. The service was good too. This isnt the type of place you go to sit down and eat a meal at. Because it's a sports bar it's loud sometimes but the perfect place to watch the game and have a burger or wings. I like this one better than some others because they don't rely on a few big tvs or projectors. They have the LCDs everywhere visible. Perfect set up and good food.",

This time around Lemon Pepper Wings and Medium Buffalo (with extra sauce), along with French Fries were the items of choice.  The Lemon Pepper, always on point, consistent at each location.  The sauce for the Medium Buffalo is not my favorite, but somebody likes it.  To compliment the wings and fries, the \"house\" ranch was...ranchy.  Drinks/Beverages: Water and Goose Island IPA.  I'm a fan of IPAs and for commercial IPAs this a decent one.  It was also the beer of the month (Yes, I'm in the Brewuniversity).

Here is the problem, my Girlfriend ordered Fajitas and the first order came and the meat was so bad she could chew it, Malachoy brought another plate and it was just as bad. At this point we had been there about an hour and my girlfiend did not want to wait for a third try. I asked for a manager and Malachoy came back ten mins later stating he was to busy to come. I got up seeked him out and stated my displeasure and ART asked why did she eat it if it was so bad? I mean really this is customer service???? I threw my bill and the table and left before I said something but I can tell you that being in sales and management for 25 years I would fire this guy on the spot. I know my measly 100 bill probably does not mean a lot to a high profile sports bar but had to let people know what a sham and what an A******** ART is!",

    "text": "My other half and I went here last night after work, so we arrived late- about 10:45 PM on a Tuesday. We found a sparsely populated bar and booth area, which was no surprise given the time of day and week. Still a good number of servers on the floor, and the house manager, Cooper, was on deck as well. Full menu was available until 2 AM, which is great for those of us who work 2nd shift. Service was good, very friendly, very accomodating (other half was not definite about his beer selection, and needed help/samples/prodding). Downside: no one seemed to know the beers all that well. Upside: too damned many beers to actually know in 6 weeks of being open!  The beer menu looked a lot like the Flying Saucer Flypaper, which is a good format. There are no flights, a/k/a themed sampler trays offered; having them could be an improvement. If you're going to go head-to-head with the Saucer, you need to promote your variety. Just sayin'. Food was as varied as the beer. We opted for the nachos-huge!- and a dessert- chocolate chimi-yummy!!! Note to self: Nachos are really big for two people as an appetizer, but just right as an entree to split. Ditto the dessert. Back to staff. Our server was extremely nice. Ask for Noelle. Tell her I sent you, and that I still don't know where I recognize her from! *g*.",

It looks as it should be a nice bar with a full service kitchen but the marketing as a family restaurant muddles that. The lighting is harsh which makes you want to have a drink and go instead spending time socializing. I wish I could say something positive about the food but, I've never had anything good here. Tacos are not the focus at this establisment and neither is mac and cheese. In my opinion that perfectly describes this sham restaurant.",

We have always had amazing service (ask for Emily if you get a chance she is one of the best servers I have had by far!!... I'm also a server so I definitely appreciate excellent service) and food. My boyfriend and I have had nothing shy of excellent service from the bartenders as well. The food has always been excellent. Tonight are only problem was server error. We were ignored by our waitress (another kind waitress helped us more than she did). Our food was cold because she left it in the window too long, so finally another waitress brought the food to us. My boyfriend had asked for a beer and she took 20 minutes to tell us they were out (this happened twice). He eventually went to the bartender and got a beer and had closed out with her way before the waitress had even stopped by again.. she also messed up his order and forgot my chili. I didn't eat because my nachos because they were cold so she told me she got the manager to take them off and told my bf she was taking 50 cents off his bill for messing up his side item. When we received our checks she had handwritten the 50 cents off his check which we found fairly weird. We also found it strange the manager had not stopped by the table to make sure their customers were happy after that mess. We ended up asking the nice server (again who was not our server) to see if she could grab them...It turns out she didn't even tell the manager she was trying to hide her terrible service (hence why my boyfriends check was half handwritten) . I have honestly never had such terrible service in my life... which stinks since TacoMac is such a great place. I wish I could remember her name so I could save everyone else the trouble of going through that mess. I just cant believe It took 2 hours for 2 beers, nachos, chili and wings. HOWEVER LIKE I SAID TACO MAC IS AMAZING, the only fault is that waitress. We will definitely be back and would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!",

We had the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer, it was so so, but I liked that they give you both pita bread and tortilla chips. I had the honey chipotle boneless wings and french fries. The boneless wings were tasty and the ranch for dipping was really good, the fries were ok. Both my daughter and her friend had the fried chicken with avocado and bacon sandwiches, and they enjoyed it, but said they had it better there before.

She seemed annoyed by and uninterested in answering our questions, yet found it necessary to over explain why she needed to know what type of wings we wanted before we could tell her which sauce flavor we wanted.   Fast forward past her \"I'm having a bad day, so that's now become your problem\" attitude and let's get to the wings. They weren't good. They were over cooked and rock hard. The cucumbers were either thawed from being frozen or had been over refrigerated. For good measure, there was a piece of random onion skin tossed on them. My issue was that at least TWO people saw what was being served. And they were fine with serving dehydrated wings and water logged cucumbers, like they would be ok being served the same. (I'm sure they would not have been.)There seems to be zero quality assurance, attention to detail, or management.  To top it off, when she brought our check, as she was walking away, I said she could take it. She heard me, looked back as if she was going to come back, but then decided against it and just walked away. Rude.",

    "text": "Personal History:  This was my 27th different Tacomac that I have been to. It was a milestone in itself. The first Tacomac I visited was about 15 years ago downtown Chattanooga on a blind date. Back then, I never heard of a Tacomac. But that's where she wanted to go. Since then I have made lots of friends at a Tacomac. I have had some good times at them and of course I have had some boring times while visiting different ones. A few have even closed that I went to.   Beers:  Wow! It is the simple truth: Tacomac has the most beers on draft and in the bottle than any restaurant / bar that I know of. This Tacomac currently has 200 different beers in the bottle and 100 different beers on draft. Or is that pronounced drought?   -------------------///////////////////---------------- Beer Club: Anyway, you can even join a beer club here called \"Brewniversity\" where they keep up with how many different beers you have tried. Once you reach 1000, you become a -Chancellor-. Personally, I know of a (double chancellor)which means that alcoholic, I mean that customer has had over 2000 different beers. I have no objective in racing to pass him nor become a so-called \"Double Chancellor\".  -------------------///////////////////----------------  Menu items ordered:  3 all beef Tacomac Tacos. They were out of hard tacos so I had to order them as soft tacos. They we're pretty good and kept me from being hungry.  On Scene Customer Service:  Well, they were a little slow.  When I was ready to order, I had to wait several minutes. I could tell the bartender was avoiding me for some reason. He knew I was ready to order but kept talking to some girls at the bar who had a little too much to drink. So, I got the attention of the other bartender to place my order.  Final Thoughts:  Well, for some reason I did not enjoy my visit here. The food was good but no social inter action at all from bartender. I even tried to tell him that I have finally visited all Tacomacs including every one of them in and around Atlanta. Just no one cares, and  a \"da\" keep pouring beer response.",

No joke, I just put the family dog down, I needed a pint and my expectations were low. A former ATL native, I just wanted something familiar.  Sean was new, but man this guy was trying. I might have had to repeat myself, but he wanted to be sure he had this order. He checked in plenty, but not that interrupting annoying way... more like WASSUP SEAN! The kitchen swapped our fries on our wing plates, but we didn't even care. We just picked em up and swapped em.  Tipped that guy 100%. Great server, good effort. 10 levels above these eye candy college girls who can't get it together when it's dead.  Sean might save this place. I'll definitely go back.",

The University Taco Mac is smaller than the South Park location, but still has a great selection of different beers on draught, in cans, and in bottles. I sat at the bar and it definitely took a while to get noticed. The bar wasn't especially busy, but there was only one bartender, Megan, working for some reason. Had no problem with the service necessarily, more of a problem with the staffing. Food was great and beer was cold. Can't ask for much more.",

Well she went to the kitchen and started to cry and a manager came over and said to us \"I have a server crying in the back and she says you cussed her out.\" I explained to him that was not the case and told him the the comment was directed at me and not the server.

I believe Taco Mac's corporate philosophy must be flawed in order to hear the same story come out of so many locations, and that is world record horrible service! First time there, there was confusion with the servers, long waits in between being waited on, and the busboy literally creeped up to the table while we were still there and took a few of our \"buy the beer keep the glass\" glasses that still had beer in them and ran off! Very odd. Next trip in went like this: friend and I walked in, place not really busy, 4 \"hostesses\" standing around host station, after some debate they decide where to seat us, we literally sat there for 15 minutes without so much as a \"we'll be right with you\", attempted to get someone's attention, and then gave up and left. This franchise could be so good if they could just figure out what is so flawed with the corporate policy.....  Don't say I didn't warn you.",

We once ordered take out from their Huntersville location and someone gave themselves a 75% tip on a take out order.  We reported it to the manager and were told it would be resolved.  It was not and we swore to never order from that location again. It did not surprise me when they went out of business a few months later.  2 years later, we decided to give the University location a chance.  It failed to meet minimum expectations as well. We put in a to-go order.  When my husband arrived, we were told they did not have an order for us.  After arguing with the \"to go person\" and showing his phone with the correct number and insisting we had ordered, she realized the bartender had our order the entire time and had not communicated it to her.  It was sitting on the bar cold after 15 minutes of back and forth.  In his frustration over the situation, my husband did not check the order and when we got home, he realized they had gotten it wrong.  Needless to say, the incompetence of this restaurant spreads to all it's locations and we do not plan to go here again.",

The food is pretty good, but a little overpriced.  The fries are excellent.  They also have a ton of TVs.  Now let's get to the service.  I've been there 3 or 4 times and the service is consistently terrible.  Maybe it's their proximity to UNCC, but whatever it is they need to get it fixed.  In my most recent visit we were seated for 5 minutes before a server ever came over.  I had to ask for a beer menu.  They have over 100 beers, why don't they just give you a beer menu with the regular menu?  My beer was almost empty when our food arrived and I quickly finished it once I started eating.  I didn't see our server again until after I was finished eating then she asked me if I wanted another.  I told her no, just a check.  She said she would get it and bring my daughter her oreos.  After another 10 minutes went by we finally got the check and of course, no oreos.  Needless to say I won't be going back.",

And when we complained to the manager he said \"okay\" and left. We asked the waitress why is food taking so long so she says it takes long for large group and it will take some more time.  I have never seen such a rude manager before. He did not even tell us that he will take care of our bill (which he did). When one of my friends went to show her weird taco, he said don't worry I will take care of your bill. Once we ate - nobody came to us to say anything. We just left. I am going to call their corporate office and file a complaint. I would never ever go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

They are both delicious but I don't think any meat-loving adults would care much about either. They do, however, have an incredible number of TVs. I think I counted between 75 and 150 last time I went. There's always something to watch. The service is great. And they have a pretty decent beer selection for a chain restaurant. I go to the Flying Saucer for beer a lot and they have about 1/2 - 2/3 the selection of the Saucer, which is still quite impressive. I'm not big on the food there but the Brewniversity club does have its perks (free stuff, mainly). The food is pretty decent bar food, there's plenty of beer and there are plenty of TVs. Definitely my kind of place if it werent for the food prices.",

Being a curious sort, in the mood for wings, I flipped a B in the middle of WT Harris and have say I'm impressed: pretty much every table/booth has its own huge flatscreen hanging from the ceiling. They have 100+ draught and 115+ bottled. And to cap it off, alongside MNF, the tv on the far right was showing a replay of the England/San Marino WC qualifier... I think I'm in love. Waiting on the wings for final verdict...  Ok, a couple days later. Still like the place. Turns out its a pretty well-known chain down south, I'd never heard of it. The wings were OK, not great, not awful (I had wings more to my taste at the Flying Saucer the following night). So, I'm sticking with 4-stars, would be a great place to watch the game.",

About 10 minutes after we were sat a server came by and said he'll be with us in a second and never came back. Yes I do understand how busy restaurants get (I work in one also) but to have customers wait for 20+ minutes without drinks is unacceptable. I'm a nice person so I didn't feel like getting a manager involved. Although, I would very much prefer the hostess put us on a wait rather than be sat and wait awhile before we get drinks. We ended up getting greeted by a different server than our original server so we just go ahead and order the food. It was alright nothing special and mind you I gave this place 2 tries in hopes of better service so I definitely will not be coming back. Servers please let the hostess know if you're too overwhelmed and you can't take anymore tables instead of having customers wait forever they will understand!!",

However, since I don't really drink beer, I will speak on the food. There prices are good for the amount of food that you get. The Chicken Cesear Wrap is my favorite.   The atmosphere is very inviting and comfortable. There's so much space in the new restaurant that you have your pick most times where you want to sit.   Also, it's a good place to watch the game or local news because TVs are everywhere.  It does have some competition with the surrounding restaurants (TGIF, Chilis, Cheddars), but it's worth the stop in because of the food quality and prices. Plus if you don't want the usual wait at other places, this is a show in (especially for lunch).",

    "text": "So, there are a few things that are very appealing about this place.  It has an enormous beer selection, both bottles and drafts.  And there are more Charlotte beers available here than almost anywhere I've seen, outside of NoDa.  There areTVs... everywhere.  We were at a booth and had a 30-something inch flat screen on the wall literally right in our faces.  Every booth has this same situation going on.  I love beer, and I love TV, so all was well there.  Everything else is average at best.  The food is your typical bar food and there is absolutely nothing special or interesting about it.  And while the idea of having a million beer options is awesome, it doesn't make a difference how many they have if you can only get one because the wait staff is not very attentive.  It is worth noting that there are some tables with built-in beer taps which would seem to offset the dicey wait staff situation.  Bottom line, this place was okay.  The appeal is the sheer number of beers available.  If your favorite beer is not offered in most bars, you may be able to find it here.  Otherwise, it's really not worth venturing into South Park for this place.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I'm from Atlanta and this review might not go very far seeing I'm not local but it's only to try and help this location improve there service. We went on a friday night around 8pm and was pretty surprised to find only that about half the tables were occupied with about 8 people sitting at the bar. I thought great,  service will be quick. After ordering it took about 20 minutes to get a draft beer, than another 20  minutes to get food. I put up the little red card in the holder which is supposed to signal your waiter that you need service. Well it stayed up there for over 15 minutes with no response. Finally took me getting the attention of another waiter.  I ordered another draft Brown Ale and was brought an IPA after waiting another 10 minutes for that one which was the wrong beer. Here is the funny but sad part, when the waiter sat it down I said that's the wrong beer. He said why, I said that's not a brown ale, he replied taste it and see!!!. If you can't tell by simply looking at color as a waiter I think some training is called for. I was nice and for fun I did taste it and explained to him what an IPA is verse a brown ale is. All that being said I was disappointed in the service but food was good. I can understand when a location is full service might be a little slow but it was far from that.   I believe in second chances so we tried it again the next night being Saturday night. Now it was later around 11pm but once again very few people and no one sitting at the bar. I ordered a 6 pack original wings hot. After once again a long wait they brought out 5 wings. I asked the waiter to count \"not to be a smart ass\" but to verify only five. He said he would correct it. 10 minutes later I got one chicken wings on a plate brought out to me.  Now this time we didn't order any alcohol just soft drinks and food. I counted maybe 20 customers in the restaurant. Overall time from entering to leaving was 1 hour 35 minutes.   From experience I should have known better than go to a place on a Friday night that should be super busy and only have 8 people sitting at the bar. But I really do enjoy the TMAC wings. Hope this place can work out whatever disconnect is going on with the servers, kitchen workers and bar staff.",

I guess that the \"secret\" is out on Taco Mac glass night and my normal running crew planned to be there to run a quick 1.5 mile run specifically around the apartments behind the Taco Mac and then go in to enjoy a beer or two to cool down and have some laughs.  Our main goal was to get the free glass - which was a glow in the dark skull glass....    We sat down and waiting a good 10minutes before someone even approached us - I don't know if it was because we were all sweaty, or whatnot, but the waitress was nice enough and we ordered - specifically asking for the beer selection that would get us the free glasses.  At first our waitress said we all had to sign up for Brewniversity... which was not the case last time.  Some of us were already members anyway, but that was the first sign of trouble.  Later another server came with 1 beer.... I thought it was strange.  But just ran with it.  It took them about 10min to finally get all the other beers.... between all the servers... there were about 3 trips to get all the beers to the table.  The last server brought a huge tray (ended up with 3 extra beers that he took back to the bar).  Anyways, everyone had their brew and were somewhat satisfied.  Usually once they bring the beer, they bring the glasses with it... but not this time.  I made sure when we ordered food to ask our waitress if there were glasses left... and she said, \"YES\".  It was really hard to get her when we needed something as well.  Refills and other orders.  Super annoying.  Food didn't take that long, but once again,it came piece meal...and some of our orders were wrong.  Halfway thru eating the waitress came back and said they were out of glasses.  She kinda gave us a half apology and tried to be cute about it... but man, what a disappointment.  I think because of the busy night, the service REALLY SUFFERED.... and for that.. I must update my review.  May have to think twice about TacoMac before returning... but what a sour note to end a supposed fun evening.",

    "text": "My first time at Taco Mac in the university area was somewhat unpleasant due to poor management that led to understaffing the night of a Duke and North Carolina game.   If your a manager in Charlotte everyone know that Duke and North Carolina will bring out 3 times the crowd to that of a normal night in any bar or restaurant in the entire state of NC so to be understaffed on this day falls entirely on managed and it should be addressed. We met friends there for a birthday gathering and it took 20 min to get a glass of water and drinks and another 45 minutes to get wings and there wasn't any apologies from staff of management regarding the long wait.    I've heard a lot about Taco Mac and I finally got to see what it was all about and I was turned off by the service.   On a positive note I will say that the food was excellent the wings very hot in temperature, The sauce was tasty and the guacamole and salsa tasted very good as well.   I may return or NOT on a night that doesn't have a major sports event on that night but I just assumed that a franchise model like Taco Mac would be prepared for the biggest rivalry in college basketball Duke and NC   My Only guess is that management was unaware or didn't care and staffed like a regular night and being that we didn't get and apology we figured she didn't care.    Service gets 2 out of 5 stars  Food gets 4 out of 5 stars   Overall I wasn't impressed we drove from mountain island area all the way to university for bad service and if it wasn't for a friends birthday I would of went to north lake mall area and visited Fox and Hound or Buffalo Wild Wings where service is always prompt and great food.",

The buffalo style was not Buffalo and the blue cheese dressing that it came with was flavorless and seemed more like sour cream.  The burger and fries was good, but under cooked, the fajita was good as well, but the beans they came with seemed like they were reheated from three days prior and had a weird taste. The shrimp wrap was OK, but the pablano coleslaw had no flavor (they may have forgot to put dressing in it).  The server had a great personality, but was slow bringing food and had to repeatedly ask for the same refill of unsweetened tea, which he kept forgetting (he comped the drink). The waiter shrugged off our comment about the food when he asked our opinion. If he waited and listened and gave feedback to the manager, they could have a better product.  We won't go back.",

My friends love this place - they have the loyalty card that gets them larger beer mugs than us occasional visitors.  I think you need to buy 100 different beers to move up.  The food is standard for bar food.  I did enjoy my chicken fingers.  I am usually a blue cheese eater but here there was no flavor to the cheese.  Very bland.  The ranch dressing was the surprise winner here.  I order ranch dressing here and blue cheese everywhere else.  The beers are great - but not always in stock.  I have had at least one beer I ordered (first or second pick) every time that was out.  I wish this didn't keep happening because it is disappointing.  With such a huge menu it is not easy picking a beer out of the myriad beers.  Once you do it is that beer that you want.  Flying saucer is similar to this place.  The trend has continued for there to be far greater choice than ever before.  This is a macro trend so I think T-Mac or Taco Mac, however you say it, is an average specimen of these types of bars.  I am a tough grader so you may think of this place as a 4, but you really have to wow me in some way to get more than 3 stars.",

Came here in a group of four on a Saturday night, and there was a 30 min wait. Sure...fine that's no biggie.  So my group and I sat at the bar & ordered drinks and appetizers. When it came time to sit at our table we were in a nice booth etc...fine so far. THEN... When we are ready to order our second round of drinks-which included 2 waters mind you....WATERS. Our ditzy server never showed up. So the men in my group went to the BAR to order drinks. That's already an issue. Finally, after waiting 20 min our server comes back around to get our orders. Then after another almost 30 min our food arrives (we still haven't received our waters at this point) and our food was COLD.  Cold wings, cold fries (ew) cold burgers. So obviously our food was sitting in the window waiting for our ditzy server. It wasn't even busy at this point! There were at least 5-6 empty tables!! (Wtf).  So we somehow manage to get the manager over to complain, and the whole time we were talking to him...he had this stupid little smirk on his face. Super. Maybe he was use to complaints? (The crowd in that area is questionable anyways) So he took back our food that was cold to make us fresh & HOT food. Meanwhile, our ditzy blonde server has finally come back with the WATER & she never even apologized. Pathetic.  All in all the food we got back was still gross, but we were so hungry we ate anyways ( I didn't eat my gross quesadilla....I munched on my friends salad instead).  Pathetic service, smirky/arrogant manager & gross food. Definitely wont be coming back here.  Watch out for the short blonde waitress with long blonde hair! You'll need smoke signals to get her attention.",

I don't know, more curiosity than anything else.  I'm glad they came up with such a fresh promo though, they definitely attracted some new clientele, which I feel they needed.   It really isn't a bad sports bar. The food is fairly decent but I feel it's overpriced in proportion to quality. I'd much rather be at a Saucer or Wild Wing Cafe. I used to like BWW too but they have since gotten greedy too.  I've been here a handful of times, service definitely could've been better almost every time.   The beer card definitely comes in handy if you frequent this place. The beer prices are average. I can't recall exactly but I thought I they could've had better specials during the week.  Overall, just such generic bar food. If it was priced better, it would probably be in my top 5 frequent stops on the way home from the office.",

When we let the waitress know she moved the cup over to an empty table across from us and asked \"so what would you like to eat\".

The location is located in University City and it is definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in the Charlotte area.  There has to be at least 100 TV's - perfect for watching Sunday night football. This is a sports bar people, please don't complain about the noise level because Bars aren't really supposed to be quiet. If you find a quiet bar, let me know.   The wait usually isn't long, the times I've been here I waited for no longer than 5-10 minutes. The service here is great, I never had an empty soda and the wait staff was attentive to our needs.   I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked exactly how I liked it and really was a great burger. The fries were delicious, too.   All in all, I say CHECK THEM OUT!

    "text": "I don't know why I thought ordering chicken with one of Taco Mac's specialty hot sauces at this location would be any different from ordering at the one in SouthPark.  As our *beloved* former president Bush would say, \"Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool me...you can't get fooled again.\"  Ah, but you can George, you can!  So, how hard is it to actually COAT the chicken in one of their \"specialty\" sauces?  A few dribbles on top barely gives me a taste of it.  Is that truly acceptable by any chicken wing/finger standard?  I ordered a Buffalo Ranch Salad with TMI (Three Mile Island) sauce for the chicken.  As you can surmise, I could barely taste what is extremely spicy sauce.   I also noted that the \"chicken\" was basically just chunks of fried breading.  There was barely a chicken to be found.   I requested blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  The salad came with a big glop of chunky blue cheese dressing on top PLUS the server brought another big side of it.   It was a nice gesture, but geez...I didn't say I wanted to drink a glass of blue cheese dressing; I just wanted it in place of the ranch dressing.   I could barely taste the droplets of sauce on the chicken to begin with; with that much dressing, it sealed the deal.    I love Taco Mac's menu options and this particular location -- the interior, the decor, the atmosphere -- but the service here for lunch is always a bit too slow.  Many of us only get an hour for lunch, and that includes drive-time.  I know I am taking my chances by going to a sit-down restaurant for my lunch hour, but I don't think a 20-30 minute wait time after ordering is acceptable for what is basically bar food.    I really wish they'd respect people's lunch times and get some freakin' sauce for their chicken options that are all over the menu.",
