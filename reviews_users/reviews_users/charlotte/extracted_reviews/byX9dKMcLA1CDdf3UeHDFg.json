However, its a sadness that is soon forgotten in the bliss of new culinary wonders. I've never had food from here that is less than astounding. My family echoes my sentiments.  Also, the waitstaff is some of the best I've ever encountered. They're knowledgeable and seem to have found that razor-thin line between not being attentive enough and being so attentive its obnoxious. Bravo.",

    "text": "Could Asbury be our new happy place? After a number of disappointing experiences at my former favorite farm to table restaurant uptown, Halcyon, we were seeking a new favorite. Hubby and I tried to go one night but they were booked on Open Table but last night we wandered in and luckily they were busy upstairs with a wine dinner but had left the main dining room unreserved. The seats were comfortable, which is important.   Our server, Donnie, was absolutely fantastic and very knowledgeable and walked us through practically the whole menu and was candid about the menu and wine items. Their new menu bringing in summer items looked fantastic and there were several things I didn't get to try (BBQ Caramel popcorn, roasted beet salad that looked awesome, burrata cheese app, etc.). We did try the tableside ceviche which that night was grouper with lime/orange acidifying pourover. We were so hungry we didn't wait until it was cured, but it was delicious anyway and is similar to a hamachi & jalapeno app but really fresh and summery. The delicious bread from Local Loaf was warm and served with herb butter.  We ordered the risotto and crab and ribeye entrees. The flavor profile on both were delicious. I'm not sure if the chef adjusted the recipe after hearing reviews but there was a really nice smoked lemon zest throughout that really was bright and crisp; perfect for summer! The ribeye flavor and vegetables were great but not enough portion for a hungry man- next time we'll order the roasted cauliflower side too.  The dessert and wine menus looked great but didn't get to take full advantage of them. We took a peek at the brunch menu and since I'm not a pork eater, there aren't a ton of items I'll be eating but there was a cinnamon chip french toast that is on my list to try!  All in all, we really enjoyed our experience and look forward to going back and trying more things.",

    "text": "We decided to have a night out at the Asbury after seeing all of the good reviews. Overall, the experience was a very positive one. We enjoyed some biscuits with bacon jam that were delicious. The strawberry soup with burrata was creative, light and flavorful. We also ordered the pork belly with crawfish and a side of carrots. Both were great, except for the strange combination of grapefruit with the pork belly. It just tasted...wrong. Oh well, we slurped it all up anyway. The service was attentive (we were the only ones in the restaurant) and we left happy. The overall bill was a little bit high, but we were satisfied with the meal, so we have no complaints there. I would recommend this place for dinner for anyone stopping through Charlotte.",

    "text": "While it neither added to nor detracted from the rating I gave the Asbury, let me take a second to note the Asbury's charmingly awkward hostess. Upon being seated, she handed me a napkin and added descriptively, \"Here's a black napkin!\" You just don't get that kind of life commentary anymore. Later in the meal, as my waiter was making a beeline for my table with a pitcher of water, she intercepted my table with a different pitcher at the last second and poured it instead. My waiter stood there sort of surprised for a second and muttered \"Thanks.\" It's weird occurrences of this sort that add so much more to the dining experience.  I was on the verge of selecting a more conventional lunch items like a pork sandwich or a burger when I noted a separate menu section at the bottom for knife n' fork biscuits. I selected one called \"The Fisher\", which featured two delectable biscuit halves with pan-fried trout cakes served over a remoulade. Everything about this part of the plate rocked my socks. I opted to have this served with potatoes, which came with some sort of bell-peppery salsa. This salsa-stuff was awesome, although the potatoes themselves were not quite as crispy as I would have preferred.  On the whole, though, I applaud the big flavors that made it to the plate, and it was undeniably one of my better meals in Charlotte.",

The risotto and blue crab entree with 60 degree egg and asparagus was also very fresh. Risotto cooked perfect, not starchy just right. Could have used a little more flavor as other have commented.   Craft cocktails and wine pairing were perfect.   I will be back bit definitely hope they take the feedback  and add a bit more boldness to the dishes.",

I saw on yelp the biscuits and bacon jam and I was staying around the corner so I added Asbury to my list of meal venues!  Not disappointed.  During the week the open at 11am so I had to wait a bit for a late brunch but it was delicious.  I ordered the biscuits and the pork belly with an egg over easy. Wow.  Yum city.  I was the first person there and was alone until about 11:45. That's when the early lunch crowd started to trickle in. Service was fine and it's a pretty small place so I could see a longish wait on a weekend or Friday night.  The restaurant is actually in a small boutique hotel so that adds to the ambiance.  Called the Dunhill Hotel, it's got an old world English flair. But the restaurant is all southern hipster menu. Ps they guard the bacon jam recipe closely. ( I tried to pry it loose).  No avail.  The pork belly was so flavorful, moist and tasty and not fatty.  Served on a roll with greens, cheese and sauce. Topped with the egg.  I had fries that are house cut but they also have greens and other sides.",

The food tastes fresh, is always cooked perfectly, and the menu does a great job at using local, in-season ingredients. The menu changes seasonally, so it's fun to go at different times of the year to see what they are offering.   The cuisine is described as modern Southern, which reminds me of the type of food they serve in Charleston (a city well-known for their restaurants). I typically get fish, but my husband will try the more adventurous items like bison tongue. We both clean our plates when we come here. The mixed drinks are good too!",

    "text": "Why you NEED to come here:  Fresh takes on Southern fare  Beautifully plated and delicious food in a refined setting  Affordable prices  Connected to the posh Dunhill Hotel, The Asbury is an elegant yet not stuffy place for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  This past weekend, my husband and I stopped by for brunch and loved our entire experience--the food, the service, and the setting.  The dishes that we sampled reminded me of Charleston's exciting dining scene. Charleston's famed chefs take Southern cuisine to new heights, and so does The Asbury's talented chef.   Just like they say on their website, The Asbury's food and presentation is southern and modern.  I got shrimp and grits. Don't expect super creamy grits and shrimp in some thick sauce or sauteed in heavy spices. No sir. The grits were formed into rectangular cakes, which made them look like fried pieces of tofu. The shrimp served alongside the grit cakes was actually a light shrimp salad. All this served on a bed of really fresh, really vibrant lettuce. This dish was absolutely wonderful. I would highly recommend this menu item unless you have a shellfish allergy or don't like grits. This lightened up rendition of a Southern favorite is reason alone to come here.  Tom N's chicken in a biscuit served with a medium egg wasn't bad either. It was also beautiful, scrumptious, and very flavorful.   Our server was really nice and not pushy at all. All I got was a mimosa, but she didn't treat us any differently after realizing that we weren't lushes. She even kindly took our picture so we could remember our awesome dining experience at The Asbury.  Definitely stop by The Asbury if you're visiting the Charlotte metro area.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch of July 4th.  I can't say enough about how delicious everything was.  I love a place that can change their menu based on what is available locally at a certain time of year.  If you enjoy biscuits, I recommend Maw Maw's Cast Iron Biscuits with the bacon jam, it was a spectacular salty and sweet appetizer (and a huge portion as well, easily big enough for two people).  I also ordered the deviled eggs and they did not disappoint, the goat cheese and bbq spiced mushrooms adding flavors that you don't normally get at family reunions on this popular and simple dish.  For the entre I went with the Crab Cake Sammy with the special side of the day (sauteed zucchini) and it was probably the best crab cake I've ever had in Charlotte.  It comes with a very light ramoulade that compliments it perfectly.  I also ordered the Farmer's Salad for the table and if you're like me and think that vinaigrette is the only salad dressing that matters, this salad will hit the spot.  Excellent assortment of local farmer's market veggies that complimented the crab cake perfectly.    I can't wait to go back and try some of their brunch and dinner selections.  One of the best restaurants in uptown Charlotte!",

I ordered the southern Benedict. The biscuits were the star again here, but the pimiento cheese sauce was very flavorful and a bit spicier than I expected. The egg and ham added solid flavors as well. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly and egg sandwich. It was decent but the pork belly was way too salty and then bun was so buttery that it felt greasy. Nonetheless the sandwich wasn't bad. Same story with both of our sides. I ordered grits and she got the mushroom risotto side of the day. Both were decent but lacked just a bit of flavor or other element to make them outstanding.  Overall the food was good and the service was solid, but nothing really blew us away, especially for the prices.",

Friendly, prompt service and the food was really excellent. We had the deviled eggs, which the chef made with purple carrots, pesto and horseradish/paprika and they were amazing.  With the deviled eggs, they brought a lamb ragout with papardelle which was thoughtful and delicious. We loved it. My only wish was that the portion was bigger, given the $16 tag on it.   Next we had their scallop dish (\"large size was $34 and had 6 perfectly cooked scallops). This dish was very thoughtful and we both enjoyed it.  With the scallops, we chose 3 sides ($20 total). We had the BruSSels sprouts, risotto, and mashies. The sprouts were spicy and roasted perfectly. The risotto had some nice acidity and chopped hazelnuts that made for a nice contrasting texture. The mashed potatoes were also tasty.   Overall, the experience was excellent. Kudos to the chef. Everything we ate was thoughtful and delicious.",

The place has an upscale and classy atmosphere without being obnoxious.   The food was good, but more expensive than the Yelp app indicated. The large plates are $28 and up and $12 and up for salads. Desserts are $9. For a nice meal with a starter, glass of wine, salad, main course and dessert, expect to spend at least  $60-70 per person.   The food was good and creative, but not exceptional. The highlights were the basil ice cream on the tomato salad and passion fruit on the chef's choice dessert.  (Although my spouse found the basil ice cream to be gross, I loved it).  We started with the deviled eggs. They are fun, but nothing fancy. My husband had the Jerk Shrimp and enjoyed it. I had the pork dish. The pork and vegetables were ok, but needed more salt to bring out the flavors. The leek puree was bland. The highlight of the dish was the fresh pickled squash garnish.

It was empty. But not a bad thing for a guy like me! I ordered an iced coffee, and this chili biscuit dish that sounded awesome. Oh, and a side salad to help process all of this southern cooking.  The chili was pretty awesome. Everything tastes pretty fresh to me. And it was cheesy and had a great mild taste. The salad was your basic side salad, but the greens tastes fresh. Featured a house made ranch dressing which was good. The iced coffee was refreshing.  I would go back. Would like to try their breakfast/brunch menu. Looks good to me!  Go in confidence",

The Savory Spice Shop actually created a spice just for them to use in this snack. The deviled eggs are better than my mom's. *don't tell her that* They have little fried cornichons on top. Cute and so good.  I went to lunch here Wednesday with Mike M. We both went with the chilled corn soup. It had a a custard in the bottom. It was fantastic. Such clean and fresh flavors. I got the tacos. I did one of the marinated 'shrooms and one of the coastal North Carolina seafood of the day (Wed it was shrimp). Both of these were really great.  If you go tacos, I recommend doing two different ones and doing a seafood of the day for one of those.  Things to know: The Asbury validates for the Fifth Third parking deck next door. If there's a table outside, get it. Great people watching for dinner. During lunch, there is always something going on in that little park looking area across the street. Wednesday there was a jazz band. The server told me you can find the schedule on the Find Your Center website. Music, aerial yoga... free entertainment!   I had the honor of tasting Chef Chris Coleman's food at Competition Dining last week. I was blown away. His second course was hands down the best dish of the night. He's really talented.  I'm a new fan of The Asbury. I cannot wait to check this place out for brunch.",

    "text": "Great place with great food and service. Only thing to consider is that it's a small restaurant so don't take anybody that you,d like to whisper to for lunch.   First, food: the Crabcake Sammy and the Springer Mountain Chicken Sammy were both really good. The latter can be a bit messy so brace yourselves. The first time I went, I had the crabcake sandwich. I was blown away by the fresh and well prepared crabcake that didn't taste like a million calories, and I can't compliment the buns on that meat enough. Does that sound weird?  As for the chicken sandwich I had the second time, which was the next day btw, it was good. I went with the spicy version but I think I would have liked the southern style better. Not all spicy sauces are created equal.  Their salad is good enough to forget whatever bothered you during the morning. But now comes the best part: Service.  The crew at the Asbury did a great job. Water was ALWAYS filled, plates were taken away at the right time, food came out on time, and they had smiles on their faces. Can't go wrong with that.  One thing though: the small space made it difficult to hear my former professor who does not speak with a loud voice. Well, I did go during lunch hour so it was full but when else other than lunch or dinner are we going to go eat, at 3 pm?",

We had the sticky buns, which I found odd, bacon, chives, goat cheese icing on a cinnamon bun. My boyfriend had the omelet of the day, which had prime rib and was yummy. I had the chicken in a biscuit which was great. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the cheese on it was delicious. All in all it was a good breakfast but hardly worth the price we paid.

Valentines dinner is supposed to be special and this place filled that requirement to the brim.  Nestled directly next door to the Dunhill Hotel makes it even more convenient by way of having access to the lounge and bar area why you wait for your table, etc.  The bar of the Dunhill is probably one of the more friendly bars I've ever been to in Charlotte.  The bartender there is super nice.  The food was prepared and aligned in 5-course manner with dishes that all were great.  I'm not going to even attempt to remember all the ingredients because they were so complex and rare.  All I can tell you is they were pleasing and I devoured every single bit.  Notably for me was the lamb carpaccio on a bed of chopped pickled beets.  I don't even like beats and couldn't believe how tasty this dish was.  The interior is warm and inviting with some great photography artwork on the walls and while it is on the smaller side relative to some places, I found it cozy and acceptable.  The service was really above par with one particular thing that really caught my attention.  I had grabbed my napkin to wipe down a spot of food from the table that had dropped and our waiter, who probably was an easy 30-40 feet away, noticed I'd done that and immediately brought over a new napkin.  Not to mention, the replacement of eating utensils for each course.  The parking here is non-existent so you'll have to work that out.  I'm sure the local parking decks are open and you can always try and street park.",

They have the best tasting and freshest chicken I've ever had and I highly recommend it. I also like how they said the menu changes frequently to keep me wanting to come back for more.",

The portions were small so you will need to other a couple of dishes. The menu had a lot of options. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the place was super pretentious and so was the waiter/owner I think. Definitely not what I expected from a farm to table restaurant in a small city.",

Comfortable seating, good color, distinct artwork on walls.  I ordered The Farmer and my son chose the two egg breakfast. He was satisfied, the flavor was good, but felt his bacon was dry.  My breakfast was very good. House made biscuit layered with fresh sausage gravy made with fresh sage, bacon, topped with a nice soft cooked egg. As a side, I ordered the grits, w/o cheese, and found them slightly undercooked and a little tasteless.  Coffee was good, service was very good, price was fine especially since it was farm to table quality.  We will definitely be returning for our breakfast when in Charlotte again.",

One of my friends loved it; the other sent it back because the crab and corn was cold on the top of the grits. I tasted the dish. I thought it was good but different strokes for different folks.   The logistics of finding the hostess is odd. I encourage directing guests to one door instead of the current setup. Additionally, it seemed as if the restaurant was short wait staff. There were fairly long wait times to get drinks and food. All in all cute restaurant with good food. If staffed appropriately this can be a Charlotte brunch go to.",

    "text": "I am from Charleston and my girlfriend and I were in Charlotte for a Panther game and we elected to dine here that weekend after seeing the restaurant on EATER.  We were greeted and taken to our seats quickly, we had reservations on a Friday night but it was only about 50% of capacity. We started with a couple of cocktails. They have a decent cocktail and and wine list with a few craft beers. We ordered a bread plate which was an appetizer special and included small dollops of pimento cheese, a garlic butter, and a house made jam. It was a good way to start the meal. We didn't get the biscuits with the famous bacon jam but they looked delicious when served to the adjacent table.  I ordered the chicken and dumplings for my entree and it was great. The gnocchi dumplings are more like tiny fried potato cakes then gnocchi. The chicken was moist served with grilled carrots and (pickled?) beets, and it is served a table side au jus application.  We ordered a fried okra for the table. This was the weakest item, while battered and fried crispy it was grossly under seasoned and served in a cream fraiche sauce that was also suffering from a fatal lack of seasoning.  I love fried okra and this dish has potential but fell short at our visit.  My girlfriend ordered the beef dish which was served as small medallions over a creamy potato. (Think about every beef dish you've ever been served at a wedding.) The temperature was a bit off approaching overcooked and the dish suffered from the same under-seasoning noted with the okra.  Overall I would try this place again. Maybe for brunch next time as it appears from reading other reviews they are a bit more consistent with those items.",

    "text": "This was my second time in and it only got better and better!   As the server communicated to us, the popular appetizers on the spring menu are the grilled NC bison tongue and the 62 degree duck egg, so of course, we opted to try both.  Raclette cheese is served in between the bison tongue, like a mini slider. I'm a very adventurous eater but never have I tried bison tongue. It tastes like a premium piece of meat - tender, flavorful and juicy, thanks to it being braised overnight. It's like your mother's pot roast, but with fresher, melt in your mouth flavors. As if the bison tongue wasn't enough to spark your tastebuds, it's served with a horseradish potato salad with an Asian fusion taste, which bring in some bolder flavor and depth. This dish may have been my favorite of the night - the Asbury team did such an amazing job utilizing fresh and local ingredients to appeal to the tastebuds.  The 62 degree duck egg is cooked for 45 minutes at 62 degrees, like you may have guessed. It's served room temperature over a slice of sourdough toast, with asparagus, radish, orange and pickled ramps. The orange/citrus flavor was subtle, but just enough for you to notice it's there. The egg takes on a gelatin consistency and runs over the crispy bread, which can then be soaked up with the asparagus and radish. The flavors offer the similarities of a light brunch, but doesn't give you that heavy feeling of fullness after.  Next up on the list was the pressed lamb shoulder and the roasted chicken. The lamb shoulder is braised for 24 hours to create that fall off the bone perfection and exquisite aroma. I loved the demi glaze which had the slightest hint of mint.  The roasted chicken dish came atop mashed potatoes, whipped with arugula and goat cheese. Talk about inventive! The chicken flavor was also unmatched - the way they create that tender juiciness is through rolling the chicken skin and then reintroducing it. The caramelized beets add a combination of sweetness and earthiness to the dish. Chicken is not something I'll usually order when out since it's so plain, but the Asbury totally transformed it into something amazing.  Squeezing room in for dessert, we opted for the key lime pie, which was a tart key lime frozen souffle with toasted marshmallows. I loved how the dish itself smelled exactly like a campfire, bringing me back to summers around the campfire roasting s'mores. Isn't it amazing how food has the power to do that?  You're definitely in for a great quality meal at the Asbury and it's all locally grown!",

Also they were out of the first 3 drinks we ordered. Waitress would drop our food off at the table courteously but never really told us what was on the plate (which is typical in fine dining). So some of these unique dishes we had No idea what we were eating (starters included 3 small plates). We had a show to catch and had to ask for them to move faster and they did somewhat accommodate. But 2 hours is way too long. No one seemed to apologize or care. Disappointing because the food l again was amazing !!",

This most recent visit was after spending New Years Eve at the attached Dunhill Hotel.  The only downer was one of timing in that it was a Sunday, before noon, so thanks to our antiquated NC liquor laws the Bloody Mary bar was not an option.  Truly a bummer anytime but particularly after NYE!  On to the food and service though and wow, what a hit all the way around!  There was a starter option that we immediately pounced on... Three raw oysters on the half-shell topped with a Bloody Mary granita.  HA!  More than one way to get me some Bloody Mary! :)  Raw oysters for breakfast you say?  HELL YEAH is what I say.  These were absolutely delicious with the granita adding an icy/spicy little punch.  And then there was the main part of my meal.  A scrambled egg and some sausage balls (yes, balls) that was another huge hit.  A scrambled egg is such a simple thing yet when it is prepared by a chef who knows what they're doing it can achieve simple perfection and this one hit that mark.  The sausage was also fabulous (Grateful Growers pork maybe given their previous connection to the space??).  Our server was so personable and friendly and hit the just right balance of checking in and staying away.  We've never been to The Asbury for dinner but given the culinary finesse shown during brunch, a dinner date is not far off.",

The fried chicken was awesome, crispy and savory on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. The caramelized onion and aioli were great pairings for this dish.

    "text": "I ate tongue. I ate tongue. Yes, you read that right! I ATE TONGUE AND IT WAS FRICKEN AWESOME!   What a treat Asbury was! My husband and I have been wanting to try the Asbury for a while  and did last week featuring their Winter Menu (menu switches by season). Note, this is a farm to table restaurant meaning every thing they make and cook is locally sourced within 100 miles of the restaurant. The menu had a variety of selections and included apps, small plates, salads, entrees and al carte items. Bellows our break-down:  Appetizer:  Deviled eggs- Now how basic are deviled eggs? You can't really mess them up, but the Asbury made them amazing! The filling was creamy and not tarty like most made with mustard. Plus, they were topped with fried cornichons aka pickles! NOM  Small Plate:  Here is the game changer. We ordered bison TONGUE! I was in shock when my husband ordered it. I was speechless. How was I going to eat TONGUE!!!?? Well when it came out it smelled bomb diggity so I had to try it (YOLO). It was fricken awesome! It was so tender and kinda of tasted like a pot roast. I WOULD order this again! Live on the edge!  Entree: I got the Lamb Chop. So tender and flavorful! The cranberry chutney with the cocoa demi glaze was a unique blend of flavors that complimented the meal well. My favorite part were the whipped sweet potatoes- they were purple! So delicious- I wanted more! My husband got the Pork Cheek (server recommendation). He really like it (I tried it- very good), but we thought it was too similar to the tongue, maybe because we liked that better. The best part of his meal I thought were the brussel sprouts with the pecan sauce. YUMMY!  Dessert: Of course we had to get dessert- who do you think we are? The pasty chef seems to switch the menu up so we tried one of her seasonal specials- Homemade cookie ice-cream (tasted like the cookie butter from trader joes) with homemade cookie crumbs and ginger snap cookies. SO GOOD!  Drink: I got the lavender blossom- titos, prosecco and lavendar- very refreshing and light! My only draw back on my experience is that the drinks seemed to take a while (10-15 minute wait) They do share the bar with the hotel (and it was pretty packed), but I could tell other tables were waiting for drinks too.  Overall, Asbury was such a delight- from the service to the food, it was a perfect evening! I will be back! I heard brunch is good too!  If you're a foodie you must try this place!  ps. I told my brother who is a head chef at a country club about my experience and he was SUPER jealous! I'll have to take him here next time he visits!",

I've tried a variety of southern food which, while admittedly tasty, did not bode well in my attempt at healthy eating. It is the start of the year after all.  The Ashbury was wonderful - from the creativity of the menu to the lovely service. I ordered the deviled eggs (ok sure, I could've picked a healthier appetizer but... when in Charlotte). They were smooth and salty and just pure gold. And the pan-seared scallops - cooked perfectly and accompanied by a creamy parsnip puree. I could have licked the plate clean.  The Falls Bounty cocktail was well balanced and tasty. The chocolate roll cake was perfectly sweet and light.   Do they do breakfast? How early are they open? All questions on my mind as I finish my last morsels. A very solid meal.",

So, on a recent visit to Charlotte I did, and came away much more impressed than by my first visit. Our waiter, Simone, was much better than our previous server - in fact, it was as if she had read my first review and was responding directly to it. She recommended a few dishes, explained what was in them, and kept my coffee cup full.  I had the Southern Benedict, which helped cover up the still a bit dry biscuits. I am coming to think that they just make their biscuits drier than I prefer. It's tough to make a tall flaky moist biscuit, but not impossible.  To drink I had the $12 \"New Fashioned.\" Despite supposedly being predominantly whiskey, I couldn't taste it, perhaps because the small ice cubes used melted too quickly and diluted the flavor. Not impressed, especially for the price.  The small space also gets quite loud, especially if one group takes the volume up because then everyone else has to go louder to compete. So, I'd say its a more lively atmosphere than an intimate one. FYI.  Glad I went back and gave them a second chance. It was worth it.",

The set up off of the street is a little awkward because you have to pass all the tables to get to the hostess stand. We were sat at a table and booth hybrid along the wall pretty close to the other diners.   The highlight of the meal and something I would highly recommend if you do go is the deviled eggs. They change out daily but ours had a bit of red peppers and onion on the top with a long thin sweet potato chip. I fully admit my words do not do justice to how wonderful they were.   Service the whole time was painfully slow even though it was only half full. I ordered the chicken and waffles which came out looking beautiful but tasted lackluster. The chicken was just warm and none of it was particularly seasoned. The boyfriend enjoyed his chicken and biscuit meal.   It is the type of restaurant that is fine if you are staying in the connecting hotel but probably not somewhere I would go out of my way to go to again.",

To cap it all off, despite having our own monthly parking uptown at various garages, we parked in the Asbury garage due to the free two hours toted on their website. When we left, we were told that they only actually take a dollar off of parking (NOT FREE TWO HOUR VALIDATED PARKING) and the garage didn't even honor the dollar off when it was all said and done.

I know I can be kinda picky since I am a waitress at a nice restaurant but it was pretty glaring. First when we ordered our drinks we asked what bloody Mary mix they used the server barely knew. We sat a few minutes before noon and asked him to put it in right at noon, took about 15 mins for us to get them. When we got our appetizer we didn't have plates. Our waiter saw pretty quickly but I hate staring at food I want to put in my mouth! Then we sat with our finished appetizer for several minutes before he even came to take our order. Thankfully it did give us time to enjoy our delicious pickled veggies in our bloody Mary's. However when we did get our entree we didn't have silverware. Again, hate just looking at food. I'm obsessed with eggs benedict and the description looked fantastic but I was fairly underwhelmed. The pork belly was missing some kind of something and the toast ended up overpowering the flavor. The fennel slaw and the apple cider hollandaise were pretty awesome though. My man got the trout hash and his was delicious which probably saved the meal for us. I would be willing to give it another shot just because I understand Easter is busy and I appreciate the concept behind the restaurant. Just won't be getting the benedict again!",

    "text": "We visited The Asbury on 5/17/14 to enjoy a meal outside on the patio with our dog.  The waitress remembered us from when we passed by earlier in the day, which a subtle, pleasant touch. She brought out some water for the dog and the menus rather rapidly. We both ordered the cocktail with the lavender infused Tito's vodka and enjoyed them. Much of the menu was focused on brunch items and on this visit, we were solely focused on lunch so that limited our options. We decided on getting the burger with the $3 upgrade to include the fries and soup, and a beet salad. Then we finished our drink and did not receive a return visit for at least 15 minutes and the food took a while to come out. As we ordered our second drinks, I asked if I could get the Tito's on the rocks, I was told no since the only Tito's they had was infused for the special cocktail. We've not had that happen before, but okay, guess I'll get a Grey Goose. While we pondered if the meat was getting slaughtered and awaiting the delivery to the chef, we also wondered why they would serve a burger without fries. Does anyone only serve a burger alone on a plate that is not a slider or some amazing Kobe masterpiece? Clearly our thoughts took over due to lack of food. Everything arrived at once. The onion soup was the best item served.  He loved it as it was served and I thought that the soup tasted great but the ratio was off -- it needed more liquid/less cornbread and more onions. The burger itself was good but the bun tasted one or two days old. The fries were not crispy with some being undercooked and certainly not worth an upcharge. The beet salad was not very good. The beets were thick and tough, the lettuce had been dressed for too long and had too much dressing. The candied nuts were yummy, as were the strawberries. Overall we enjoyed ourselves and had fun people watching but I'm not sure this would be a restaurant we would come back too.",

    "text": "Service was odd. Initial greeting and seating were good but afterwards, servers just stood around, ignoring us. I finally asked the first man if he were a sommelier. Answer, \"no.\" \"Do you even like wine?\" was my next question. Answer, \"no.\" OK, it was going to be that kind of experience: untrained and unsophisticated staff but at least honest. I started with a bottle of the great Foppiano Petite Syrah at $44. It was brought out and he began to open it behind me. I turned and demanded to *see* the bottle to make sure he had gotten it right -- remember, he doesn't even like wine. It was the right bottle, and a quick taste showed it was too warm, no doubt stored too near a heat source. I reasoned that it would cool to room temp quickly enough and it was otherwise fine, so I accepted it. I will leave out the rest of the wine service. The selection is limited and woefully incomplete. It's not a corporate selection but Chef needs to bring in someone who enjoys wine to add some interest to his offerings.  The roasted beets were a disappointment. Thick slices of beets (if they were roasted, they may as well have been boiled) and and thin slices of apple on microgreens. It was simple, plain, and uninspired and overpriced at $8. Bread was not ever offered and two at our table did not order starters. I requested bread, please! -- at least for them. In about 3 minutes, a small tray of delicious bread with flavored butter arrived. Outstanding! One dinner said it was the highlight! Why was it not offered (1) at first, (2) with the wine, or (3) at the arrival of the starters? And why did I have to request it?  The Trigger Fish was a surprise and at $27 a disappointment. This is not how I have it at the coast and you almost never see it this far inland. The shape and texture were odd because of the cooking method. I do not recommend.  The lemon grass pot du creme had lemon grass in it? The other desserts were forgettable. The French Press coffee was excellent and I recommend it highly; 2 cup press for $6!  The food can be improved. The wine list can be improved. Service can be improved. All they have to do is do it. They already have a great manager. I remember Monticello where I had dozens of memorable meals.",

So freaking good.   I had the shrimp and my husband had the chicken and dumplings for entrees. It's rare that I out-order my husband but tonight I was victorious. The shrimp were buttery and perfectly pink, and the accompanying polenta was more like grits with a fantastic crunch from the pickled cabbage. My husband loved the chicken and dumplings and  it was a close call as to which entree was tastiest.   The entrees were generous so we were too stuffed for dessert but the menu was intriguing. Our waiter solidified our experience at the Asbury - he was knowledgeable and friendly. We will definitely be back!",

However, you only get 3 of the tiny little things. Everything else had good portions. I got the chicken in biscuit and it was delicious. Cool looking restaurant. Our server was a little awkward and not very talkative but she got the job done.",

Boy what a disappointment   First the service was terrible they only had 3 tables and 10 people running around they obviously dont know how to run a restaurant   The food was ok. I am assuming  they have a new chef or the glowing reviews were by friends or people who usually  eat at McDonalds  I will say some of the other waiters seem to be on thier game just not mine   Its a good thing they dont cater to the local uptown residents because if they did they wouldnt make it",

A couple of weeks ago we went there for brunch, and really enjoyed everything - especially the chorizo meatballs and the biscuits!  Last night I was there with a party of 7, and most of us ordered either the Chicken and Dumplings or the shrimp dish.  The chicken and dumplings were to die for - a chicken leg confit, with little pillows of yummy gnocchi goodness, and roasted root veggies.  Not the mushy mess that I grew up eating at the S&W. We started with the Cast Iron Biscuits and Bacon Jam and would have ordered more starters if we weren't time crunched to get to the theatre to see Playing For Others. Can't wait to go back and try the Deviled Eggs and the scallops. If you have not been - GO!  And pay particular attention to the art on the walls.  It provides fascinating inspiration for conversation with your dinner companions.  Though once the food arrives that is all you will talk about.",

    "text": "This place has a very simple, styleless, almost utilitarian decor that is at odds with the cozy hotel it adjoins. I'm not a fan of the decor at all. It's like they took an old storefront, cleared it out, threw some plain tables and chairs down and some bad modern art on the walls and said \"go!\"   The menu is somewhat neurotic - vacillating between flat out comfort food (mac and cheese, the aforementioned biscuits) and fussy-southern. The food, notwithstanding, is quite good. The biscuits are amazing. Another solid southern appetizer is the deviled egg. The burger is on the 8 out of 10 scale - pretty good. And I love the salads, which are a standout, particularly the grain salad. The menu is kept small and tight, and that works here. No incredibly exciting dishes, but they're trying to do southern food, so no surprise that there's not much flare. The desserts are sold and the bar makes a good martini.   Overall, this is a solid choice before shows at the theaters across the street. It's a tad pricey for how middle of the road it is, but it is convenient and the wait staff could not be more friendly or accommodating. Many restaurants seem to have come and gone in this space, and this is one of the better ones. Hope it sticks around for a while.",

They try to source as many ingredients as they can locally, and serve brunch (Saturday and Sunday), lunch, and dinner. The flavorful food here is unreal!  My favorite lunch dishes: * Deviled Eggs -- which style depends on the time of year or the day. Sometimes with candied bacon on top, sometimes with a twist, it's always a surprise.  * Watermelon salad (in the summertime) * Cast Iron Mac + Cheese -- cheddar, grilled piquing peppers, crispy country ham, and goat cheese make up this dish. I never would have put these ingredients together but holy moly they're good!  Staff here is very nice and explain any dish you've got questions about. The dining area is quaint and white table cloth seating, and bright thanks to the nice, big windows.   P.S. I've yet to eat dinner here, but it's on my list!",

    "text": "Many have mentioned The Asbury, and it's been a while, so I figured it was time to stop in. Specifically, I haven't been to this location since it was something else. Harvest Moon, I would say. And Monticello before that. So it's been a bit.  Regardless, it was time.  The first thing that is a bit odd is though they have signage along Tryon, you have to enter through the Dunhill. Not bad, it just seems like they would want you to come in the front door.  It's not difficult to come in via the Dunhill or anything, it's just odd is all - like \"hey, let's go there\", then \"oh, you go in over there instead\", then \"huh, where do we go\", and it makes the process seem a little strange.  So once we're inside, the seating process is fine, though those mirrors on the wall have to go. If you're facing away from the wall it isn't bad - you see the mirrors on the opposite wall. But if you're facing the wall, you end up either looking at yourself or looking at other diners all the time. Not really sure of the purpose.  The staff jumps to help, and are very attentive, filling drinks and helping with descriptions, so no worries there.  We were there for brunch, so ordered some of the cast iron biscuits. They come in their very own cast iron pan. I think this is a good thing, because it makes it seem like they were just done, all on their own. They do come with a little side of butter and another of the bacon jam. They were good, but could have used more of both sides since the biscuits were so big. They are also really crumbly. Keep in mind if you're attending an event later. Or just don't want biscuit crumbs on you.  We then shared some mac and cheese and an order of the eggs benedict. The mac and cheese was tasty - no doubt about it. It was likely the best thing we had. However, it was billed as \"cheddar, grilled piquillo peppers, crispy country ham, goat gournay cheese\". I can buy that. Well, I did buy that. But I digress.  While these things all may have been in there (it's tough to tell cheeses when they are all melted together), some are tougher to tell than others. If you expect a pile of ham in there, don't. It may add something to the flavor, but you aren't getting ham and cheese. You're getting mac and cheese. If you expect big chunks of pepper, you might want to bring your own. But seriously, the flavor here is worth it, just set your expectations accordingly.  Onto the benedict. This gives another look at the aforementioned ham. A traditional eggs benedict comes with english muffins, poached eggs, canadian bacon (or some reasonable approximation) and hollandaise. Here, we have another appearance of the biscuits, what appeared to be one of the thinnest possible slices of ham, poached eggs and a dab of gravy.  Now all in all that could be good. But the biscuits here, unlike those in the cast iron pan, were nearly rock hard. The thin slice of ham added no texture, unlike a thicker slice of canadian bacon. The poached eggs were rather underdone, so you could not cut into them - they just dissolved into puddles of goo. And the gravy barely covered the top of the dish, much less allowing you to soak up something with those biscuits, which could have helped.  So while the flavors here were okay, the textures were just way off. Maybe putting it in a bowl and serving a skillet with some potatoes would have worked, but not as a benedict. Luckily the staff kept beverages full and that mac and cheese was really tasty, even with only a touch of ham.",

    "text": "Had brunch at The Asbury on Saturday afternoon. Shared Maw Maw's Cast Iron Biscuits, Deviled Eggs, and Chicken In A Biscuit.  Quality The Asbury was widely touted as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte, so I was very excited to visit. And while I saw the potential, I was not overly impressed with their brunch. We started with Maw Maw's Cast Iron Biscuits, which I did not enjoy at all. Four large biscuits served with butter, berry jam, and bourbon bacon jam. And while the bourbon bacon jam was rich and tasty, it was not enough to make up for the dried out biscuits. Lathered in butter and jam I still struggled to consume them. Next was the Deviled Eggs, which on this morning came with bacon and blue cheese. I felt blue cheese was the wrong choice as the harsh flavor overwhelmed the bite. With blue cheese it takes a very delicate hand and I believe they completely overdid it. The Chicken In A Biscuit however went a long way towards winning me back. Wonderful moist chicken, perfectly fried, served on a biscuit with a fried egg on top and doused in cheese sauce. The runny yoke and sauce helped improve the biscuit and the combination of items just worked great.   Quantity We did not order a ton of food, but it was more than enough for the two of us to share. Maw Maw's Cast Iron Biscuits are quite filling as is the Chicken In A Biscuit.  Value The brunch menu was extremely affordable with only one item costing more than $14 and that was a platter made for four.  Ambiance The Asbury is located in the Dunhill Hotel in the Uptown area of Charlotte. The space itself is small and simple. With about a dozen tables it creates for an intimate experience. It has a lot of traditional style elements, likely inspired by the hotel it is found in. The walls have an assortment of paintings, but otherwise the space is pretty empty. They do share a bar with the hotel, which was being used as a Bloody Mary station during brunch. This lobby or lounge area had a lot of character.   Crowd On a holiday weekend with lots of other activities going on, including a Nascar rally, the restaurant was practically empty. There was one other small group and two more customers walked in just as we were leaving. The staff mentioned multiple times it was strange for the restaurant to be that empty for brunch. So despite the appearance on this afternoon, it seems that reservations are encouraged.  Service The staff was very friendly and they had our food out quickly. They also knew how to keep the appropriate distance, which sometimes is tough when a restaurant is quiet.  Parking We walked over from our hotel, but the parking situation did not seem simple. There was no street parking so you would need to find a lot or garage nearby.  Extra The Asbury did not live up to my lofty expectations, but was serviceable for brunch. If I had longer in the city, I would have loved to see their dinner offerings, but I personally would not go out of my way for their brunch again.",

We had made a reservation for lunch and were surprised to see we were the only ones there. There was one waitress there she was super sweet and attentive. She gave us a quick run through of the menu and really talked up many of the dishes!   I got the Roasted Turkey and Dumpling Soup. It was pretty good except the soup was a little salty. The Tempura Cauliflower was a little under-fried and became soggy really quick with the sauce it was in. Since everything was cold on that plate, it made it hard to eat especially since the cauliflower was not crispy. The Butternut Risotto was a little salty as well and the risotto was undercooked. The mac and cheese was rich and boomin' with hearty cheeses. The biscuits here are pretty bomb! Especially the honey butter, that stuff is addicting. Prices aren't too bad either for portion size either.",

Liked: Chefs whim deviled eggs - inventive and tasty  Fall vegetable chopped salad- surprisingly delicious and my favorite part of the meal  Mac and cheese - yum!  Brussel sprouts-  cooked and seasoned well  Just okay: Cauliflower entree - my friends seemed to like it, but it just seemed to be a cooked head of veggie to me  Biscuits and bacon jam- biscuits were a little crunchy for my liking. Jam was great!  Disliked: Butternut squash risotto- expected rich goodness with the goat cheese and the chili, but it was boring  Chicken Sammy - lacked flavor",

It's a creative menu and we truly enjoyed our brunch. I recommend that you try the ham and goat cheese sticky buns....I've never seen these before, they're delicious and truly unique.   The Asbury is well appointed and sits attached to a very cool vintage Charlotte hotel making it a great spot for visitors to check out. They will validate your parking (for a total of five bucks) if you park at 5/3 Bank.  Waitstaff are very helpful and pleasant and the place is spotlessly clean. The Asbury is kid friendly but not kid overrun.",

It was rated well and the food seemed like it would be right up my alley - small plates, farm to table, etc. However, the food that came out was pretty average in my opinion. We ordered the beef brisket to share, brussel sprouts, soup, and crispy potatoes, and everything tasted okay, but for the prices seriously under delivered. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was also a bit dated and stodgy.  In my opinion, if you're looking for good southern food in Uptown, go to Kings Kitchen - you'll have a better experience.",

We ordered the mac and cheese, their famous biscuits, butternut risotto, and cauliflower tempera. The biscuits were amazing, I especially love the honey butter! The risotto were undercooked unfortunately, so I was a little disappointed in that. But overall I definitely recommend trying their biscuits and the mac and cheese such a perfect comfort dish!",

    "text": "Top line: new concept, with a great chef, was excited to try, but overall, disappointed.  Went to the Asbury with high expectations.  Harvest Moon (old concept that was in the same space), was a gem of Charlotte, and having the old McNinch House (easily the best restaurant in Charlotte) chef could only elevate the quality of this place.    Asbury focuses heavily on farm-to-table and cooking seasonal foods, both which are concept that I fully support.    Went to Asbury for dinner, and I am sad to report that it was disappointing.  Food was lacking in flavor, especially the pork belly which was poorly seasoned.  Service seemed to be confused, delivered the wrong meal to one of our guests/courses were timed poorly.  Bottom line: place was a miss on both food and service and I would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "Charming atmosphere. Outstanding service. Delicious food!   While visiting Charlotte for only one night following our honeymoon, my husband and I stopped in The Asbury on a Sunday night.  Atmosphere: The restaurant is small but elegant and warm, I recommend a seat near the window so you can watch the downtown foot traffic. There were simple and beautiful wildflower arrangements on each table.   Service: Southern hospitality at its finest! The hostess found out that we were celebrating our honeymoon and sent out some champagne for us to enjoy. Our server (Donald, I believe) was really knowledgeable about the origin of all of the locally grown food and also made excellent wine and beer recommendations.   Food: We started with the pickled shrimp and boudin over hominy grits and tomato poblano broth ($14). The dish was great, with lots of textural components between the grits and the crispy boudin. The pickled shrimp was served cold over the hot components, which was surprisingly delicious. We didn't pick up on much of the poblano flavor, but the overall flavor was still amazing.   Next we split the carrot dish, which was different preparations of carrots over a puree ($8). It was tasty and beautifully plated. It was a good portion for two of us to share.   We also ordered the Duo of Heritage pork, which included pork belly and loin ($28). It was served over pecan-blackberry BBQ sauce (SO delicious... they should bottle it!), a mixture of peas and lima beans. There was also a delightful popcorn emulsion that beautifully complemented the pork.   Finally, the chef sent out an amazing dessert variety. Chocolate olive-oil cake with lightly whipped mousse, some kind of shortbread with whipped cherry mousse, etc. They were all delicious and beautiful, but we were really full by that point.   I highly recommend this restaurant! AMAZING!!",

Everything we ate was out of this world, the wine was phenomenal, and best of all, all the ingredients come from within 200 miles! A True farm-to-table. The pricing is comprable to any other uptown dining, maybe not even as expensive.  All in all, a truly outstanding meal, we will certainly return!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place so much, but it fell just a little short.  They are doing many unique things with the ingredients, from pickling, to curing, to fermentation, etc.  I love that they are trying all these things, but they really need to perfect the dish composition, instead of just throwing something unique on the dish.  I had the cured trout and farro.  This was a new dish that I had never experienced.  It was very unique, but not for everyone.  It just felt like something was off about every dish on the table.  My wife had scallops that were grainy, but the accompanying sides were great.  Every dish was gorgeous, so plating here was some of the best in Charlotte, I just wish the flavors came together more than they did.",

She started us off with a little taste of their homemade banana bread (I didn't know banana bread envy was a thing, but I will not stop until I can get mine to have that kind of color and flavor).  Then we each ordered the chicken and waffle brunch.  Delicious!  A golden-friend breast, waffles thin enough so that you can actually eat the chicken with them, and a delicious sorghum syrup.  Oh, I should also mention that we started with the sausage souffle (sausage, egg custard, biscuits...breakfast bread pudding heaven)...even though I'm reluctant to admit that we managed to eat all of that. Great experience.  Also, it's in a hotel that we learned on a ghost tour the night prior is one of the most haunted in Charlotte, so there's that too if you're into that kind of thing.",

I needed up getting his first suggestions because I wanted something full of veggies. Food was amazing Chef Mike Long out thought into every ingredient pairing and even the plating. The grit cake stayed crisp even thou it was in the middle of a savory miso broth. The greens were bitter and cut thru the richness of the cake. All the veggies were cooked to perfection to bring out the tru character of each ingredient. Pastry chef Miranda Brown crated a bees wax ice cream. Even thou I have a high lactose intolerance I asked Franklin to bring me a taste. And oh wow. So rich and creamy. I know they have a cow in the back and are milking that baby themselves. The beeswax was a subtle after thought that lingered in the back of your mouth. A perfect finish to this meal.  Will be back for biscuits",

    "text": "I feel like so many sources have listed the Asbury as one of the best brunches in Charlotte. I was excited to finally try it. Then the good came out, excitement was gone.   The Asbury entrance is through the lovely lobby area on the Dunhill hotel. When we arrived for brunch on Saturday morning there was no wait and surprisingly very few people. We were able to pick any table and then greeted by a very sweet friendly server. I always figured it to be a fancier spot but the brunch atmosphere is very low key. The service was on point through out the meal, between our server and the manager our drinks were never empty and we were well taken care of.  So the food. The menu is definitely southern inspired but all the brunch items were super enticing. I decided on the chicken in a biscuit. The biscuit was fluffy and yummy. The pimento cheese gravy was just kind of blah, thick without much flavor. And the chicken, all the breading came off as soon as I cut into it. The food was fine, but not a lot of flavor or interest. If I go back I definitely wouldn't order the same thing.",

The deviled eggs stood out as the best if the apps as well as the sticky biscuits but realize they are Very small maybe enough for 2 with a small appetite.   We had the grouper over a bed of field peas and okra. The grouper was under seasoned and under cooked while the vegetables were delicious.   Too many options in Charlotte to return here. Maybe a bad night so try it yourself and decide.",

    "text": "Chose this spot for our anniversary dinner on a Thursday evening.  We made reservations which were not needed since the place was empty besides one other table of 4.  This place is much smaller than I envisioned so makes me wonder how they manage a brunch on the weekends but I've heard it a good option as far as brunches go!   They serve farm to table selections so the menu might rotate some since our choices were nothing like menus in the yelp pics.  Bottom line it was all tasty  but the portions were small in my opinion given the price!   The rustic biscuits are really good but you have to ask for butter if you want as it is not served with it but they do serve it with an in season jam we were told raspberry but it was strawberry  actually but very yummy all the same.    We shared the peach  salad and that was the star  of the show if you ask me - arugula fresh peaches blueberries and the most delish fresh lemon  vinegarete dressing- I could have licked the plate lol.     For dinner the hubby had the Lamb neck kinda similar to an oxtail in a sort of BBQ sauce over yellow beets and savory coleslaw (wasn't a fan of that but just me) and some type of green looked like a spinach or kale  meanwhile I opted for skirt steak with sauteed mushrooms and asparagus- it was very flavorful.    Even though it was our anniversary there were no gratuitous desserts but we tried what was basically a blond brownie with a salty miso caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream  I liked it the miso caramel actually complimented the sweet of the brownie and ice cream .   They give you a decent pour of wine  and they have a very limited selection of IPA beers    We will definitely try the brunch!",

We tried the Pork chop entree with savory meat and greens, very succulent. The appetizer menu has changed and no more bacon jam:( but the goat cheese biscuits are amazingly delicious!! Hot fluffy bread homemade with sweet goat cheese.  My favorite is their Fried green tomatoes appetizer is wonderful!! Served in a cast iron skillet with yummy pimento cheese and wonderful flavors!! The dessert of Beeswax ice cream is remarkable and fantastic! I think it tastes like allspice or nutmeg but the awesome server Elizabeth said its the beeswax!!  The cocktails are also wonderful and I tried the old fashioned standard and it was excellent. For dinner we liked the German Riesling, which suits our simple summer dinner flavors. It's a small restaurant so make reservations. Parking is available at the Dunhill hotel validated or there are several nearby parking garages.",

We came by for lunch as we had received a gift certificate and wanted to try this place out. Friday's tend to be very slow uptown and this was not exception, maybe 10 guest in the entire restaurant. Our server seated us and brought out water..and it was 15 minutes until we saw him again. No recommendations or specials just what would like to drink? We ordered deviled eggs, a double burger and an entree salad. When I asked for temp on burger we were told they don't do that...a 14$ burger with no side I would expect a temp or an explanation at worst...but the burger was solid. The griddled cheese and mushrooms are fantastic. Ordered fries and Mac and cheese as sides and both were good, just not great. Salad wife had was just ok..all in all 50$ for lunch in uptown with these reviews I would've expected more...at the very least great service.  Maybe I came on a bad day?",

They changed every day as far as toppings, but the Dijon flavor in the filling is always amazing! You must get these if you go! My second recommendation is the sticky biscuits. As their motto is #BodyByBiscuit, these are a great choice!  Pork Cheeks entree was perfect with amazing mashed potatoes and perfectly cut apple pieces. I also recommend the cast iron Mac and cheese. (I got it for brunch previously, and it was easily a mea in itself.)  Staff is small, but all friendly and nice. Great date spot!",

We began with the chef's choice deviled eggs, which are always something new but always delicious. We also ordered the sticky biscuits, which are a great appetizer. Bite size biscuits with ham drizzled in goat cheese icing.   We both ordered cocktails as well, and they were affordable and very delicious! I ordered the $12 Morning Sunshine - St. Germain, Grand Marnier, blood orange soda, and sparkling rose. My husband ended up getting 2, $10 Wake up Right because they were so delicious! Iced coffee, Evan Williams bourbon, Damn Fine Chocolate, almond milk, orange, and cinnamon. We we're seriously very pleased with the drinks.   For entrees we ordered the Chicken in a Biscuit and the Southwestern salad. The chicken was just divine. Perfectly cooked and had so much flavor. We replaced the cheese fondue with the popular pimento cheese gravy. It was a great call. Seriously so great for $10! The Southwestern salad was fresh and delicious. Great lettuce.   We haven't been happy with the brunch scene in Charlotte, but the Asbury proved us wrong.",

    "text": "Had Sunday brunch here with friends. Space is fine. The place was dead from noon (when we arrived) until about 1:30 when it got pretty busy. Service was good. This is a restaurant hotel.   We ordered the deviled eggs and sticky biscuits to start. Both were ok but the sticky biscuits portion was tiny (these are bite sized biscuits, but you do get about 8 of them in the order).   I order the omelet on special. For $10 it was a 2 egg omelet, served with no side, and it was served with a different cheese than the waitress said it was. Unfortunately I hate cheddar and that's what it was served with, though the waitress had specifically told me it was another cheese prior to me ordering. The omelet was not for me and was tiny. My husband ate it. I ordered a biscuit and it was hard as a rock.   My husband had the meat and potatoes entree and it was REALLY small. He ate again immediately after we left the restaurant (even though he had my entree and his).  We have friends who love this place, but I likely won't be back.",

    "text": "While my finger was leaning towards the 5 stars, I would definitely want the full experience before I made that call. As our experience went though, we had a very nice time, with nice service (especially given the circumstances) and delicious food.  I arrived with a group of girlfriends on the night of the Justin Timberlake concert in Charlotte. We used Yelp to find nearby restaurants to our hotel. I don't think we had realized how nice this place was when we arrived; we were looking for a quick bite to eat of quality, non-fast food. As soon as we walked up, we realized that this location was going to be nicer than our expectations but we were starving and ready to relax after a road trip from Raleigh.  The hostess, who I believe was also the manager, was very friendly as she informed us the restaurant (the seating area itself looked very small) was full given the events in town. But she immediately offered that we could sit at the bar area. She led us to some nice, plush lounge chairs and told us the bartender would help us though he was a bit swamped as well. After taking our drink orders, she left and we perused the menu. Everything sounded delicious but the logistics of eating an actual meal in our lounge chairs seemed awkward. So we decided to do a tapas assortment of the various items from the appetizer menu.   The manager ended up coming back to take out order which we appreciated given how swamped the bartender was. She was very friendly the whole time and also quick to refill our drinks. About 10 minutes after our order was placed, our multiple items came out. They all looked incredible but also tasted delicious. We were very happy with our decision and it seemed to help with both the quick turnaround time to leave before the concert as well as how to eat a meal with our seating situation.   We had a really nice experience at the Asbury and I would definitely come back for a more formal dining experience in the restaurant itself.",

Both were delicious and great dishes for two people to share. My wife had the catfish and I had the lamb neck. Both were amazing and perfectly cooked. Our dessert, the beeswax cake with ice cream was delightful. We both left happy with full stomachs, but not too full. The only qualm we had is that apparently the head bartender doesn't work on Mondays so our drinks were slightly inconsistent in presentation but on the plus side maybe slightly stronger than usual....which we didn't mind!  Great place for a date night or quick bite in the bar area.",

For starters, we ordered the skillet biscuits and the deviled eggs. The biscuits came with a mouth-watering, delicious bacon jam. I also don't normally like deviled eggs (Goose ordered them), but these were amazing! Apparently the deviled egg menu rotates, but the mustardy filling in these was much better than the mayonnaise overload at your family reunion potluck.  For main course, Goose ordered the fried chicken sammy and was really impressed. I got one of their seasonal salads, and it was the perfect size and flavor for the season!   We stayed for dessert, and ordered their bread pudding. I would also not normally ordered this dish (what can I say, I really love my man), but it was so good! It was infused with cream cheese and golden raisins, which added the perfect holiday spin on this similarly dicey potluck staple.  Our server was very attentive, and everything came out quickly. Would definitely come back!!",

The husband got the fried chicken sandwich which sounds simple but it was so perfectly fried with homemade pickles and a great bun.

I was offered another cup of coffee but the waitress never came back to fill it.  She walked over to table next to me asked if they were doing ok, they asked for their check and before I could get her attention she went back behind the doors to kitchen.  I waited for her or someone else to come out.  By that time I was finished with my meal, coffee and water glasses completely empty with no refills even after it was offered to me.  Kept waiting to get my check finally after several minutes I got up and went to the hostess counter.  Another waitress walked out said \"I'll be with you in just a moment\" she then came back and asked if she could help me, I said I just need to pay my bill. She looked at me confused & said \"you were at the bar?\" I said \"no I was right there\" pointing to my table 10 feet away (they place is small so all the tables are close) I got my bill gave her $20 bill for $16 & change she looked at me confused I said \"I need change\" she brought me my change & I left.   If you like to be ignored and looked at with blank stares for basic dining service needs this is the place for you.",

    "text": "It was fine. I hate when I'm not excited to review a place I've been to.  That's the only thing that keeps popping up in my head when thinking about my experience at The Asbury. I remember the entire experience, the food, the service, and it all comes back to, \"Yeah, it was fine.\"  My experience was on Valentine's Day and there was a prix fixe menu for everyone that night. The options weren't too overwhelming, but there were a couple things I expected to really enjoy.   They started us off with an oyster amuse bouche. It was lightly fried but still super oyster-y. It wasn't my favorite consistency but my girlfriend really enjoyed it. I went with the pan-seared scallops as my first, and it was actually quite delicious. Scallops were cooked well and had roasted parsnip puree and chicharrones which made it a little more fun.  For the second course, I had the duck and was disappointed. The fat hadn't been rendered down enough and the skin wasn't crispy. The flavor was there but just an off-putting consistency with the fat. Very meh.  The third course was pretty solid - a red grouper with mushrooms, turnip, and harissa. The fish was nice and meaty was was able to stand up to the harissa so it was enjoyable.   Desserts were pretty decent and we both split each of ours. One was a suncrisp apple cake and one was a chocolate and peanut butter inspired. Both were pretty good and a nice way to end the meal.  Overall, the plates were a bit rushed out, as was the wine. I understand Valentine's Day is a busy night for restaurants, but I don't want any of my wine pairings brought out before I finish the previous dish. Just seems sort of sloppy.  I wanted more from The Asbury after hearing some good things and it being a big night.  It fell a little short of expectations and unless someone REALLY wants to go here for a special occasion, I doubt I'll be back soon.",

The bacon jam is the reason to come here. It's not life changing to where you will only eat bacon jam the rest of your life, but something worth trying. Biscuits are perfectly soft and with a hit of salt.   Southern Benedict: This is the reason I gave it 3 stars. Cut into the poached egg, and what run's out? Nothing, because the yolk was completely cooked. Really disappointed in that. Smothered in pimento cheese.  Biscuits + Gravy: Honestly, it's pretty basic and not what you should get when trying a place for the first time. But it was good, and I enjoyed it. The potatoes were great as well.  I probably won't come again, but I do recommend coming for those cast iron biscuits.",

Our server was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and made it quite difficult to decide on an entree, as everything sounded so delicious. With the chef focusing on regional ingredients and farm to table freshness, this menu truly gave a taste of North Carolina. It would be highly recommended that both residents and visitors of Charlotte take the time to enjoy all that this new restaurant has to offer. I would recommend coming sooner than later and ask about anything special regarding the wine list. Make a reservation, the restaurant does appear to have limited seating.",

Just a few little things:  I ordered poached eggs and received fried,  too little sausage gravy which the biscuit quickly sopped up, and I had gone online to research the menu only to discover they had switched their menu from Winter to Spring and not updated their website.

It has replaced Harvest Moon Grill in the Dunhill Hotel, which I had only tried once and left very disappointed. I don't think both restaurants are affiliated in any way, and I can safely say that The Asbury hit the spot for brunch. It's in a relatively small space in the Dunhill with an entrance on Tryon.   The menu itself is also not overly abundant but there is a good variety. The biscuits, deviled eggs, and southern French onion soup were enjoyed by all as the whole table split these snacks. I don't even like biscuits and these were very good in a bad for you kind of way. I ordered the \"carrot\" hummus which was different but definitely worth a try especially with the crispy crackers that accompanied it.  For entrees, the dishes were cream cheese stuffed french toast, pork belly Benedict and the wife and I each took the smoked trout hash. We didn't really share these dishes, but we all wound up with empty plates so that means something. For dessert, the table split the chess pie, which is apparently a old school southern dessert that I had never had before. It came out with 3 pieces of pie stacked up on each other with the actual chess pie being in the middle surrounded by pieces of chocolate pie on either side. In a word, it was delicious! We will definitely be returning here soon and trying out the lunch and dinner menus.",

    "text": "Wow!! Loved this place. Old historic hotel in uptown. We went for brunch and this place looked high end and pricey. It is, but so worth it. I have been dying for pork belly and this place offered it to me in the form of breakfast!!! So, I had a Mamosa and the boyfriend had a bloody Mary both good but both not included in our brunch. Our waiter was slow and took a little long coming back to us. I then ordered the Pork belly, egg, and cheese Sammy. Omg, the pork was porky, and salty and fatty and so good!!! MY egg was cooked exactly as I asked and I'm just realizing now that I didn't get the Dragon cheddar on it that I was supposed to, but nonetheless it was delicious. I ate it open face and the roll was really good, almost brioche-ish and it sucked up all the porky juices. It came with grits which were delicious but not over-the-top great and they were actually very heavily textured. Kind of looked like there was shredded corn in there if you know what I mean.  My boyfriend got the crisp waffle and grilled peach. He said it was the best thing he ever tasted. The waffle was big and light and fluffy slightly sweet and so delicious. The Nutellla on the top was just incredible and the only complaint he had was that he would've preferred canned peaches (believe it or not) because they are sweeter and softer. I'll be going back again for dinner to have a romantic night on the town in this historic hotel that looks very quaint and cozy and a throwback to the 20s.",

We are not picky eaters at all, we absolutely love food anywhere and all the time. I ordered the New Fashioned cocktail and it tasted like watered-down whiskey. The pumpkin bisque tasted like water, lacking seasonings and salt. The biggest disappointment was the lamb heart and carrots. Our server failed to explain that this dish was cold, shaved lamb with raw carrots. I suggest you do not order it.   As for the entree, we ordered pork cheeks. These were tender and supposed to come with a \"sweet potato casserole\" - which proved to be sliced cooked sweet potatoes with a meringue. However, you foodies, the meringue was not luscious and delicious as imagined, it is only a crumbled up meringue cookie.  All in all we will not be returning - don't waste your time or money.",

They are very expensive for the area, and my pork cheek main dish was ok, but I was left with the impression they are trying too hard to be fancy rather than focusing on the taste.  So, minus another star.  Even though I will be in and out of the area for months, probably won't be back.",

The cheeseburger featured two crunchy brown discs that must have been cheese left on the griddle till it burned. I think the dishes were prepared as intended. We ordered these because they had less food terminology that had to be looked up in the descriptions. If this is new southern locally sourced cuisine, you can have it. The menu made it seem like the chef just threw together as many disparate ingredients as possible and called it dishes. We had room service at the Dunhill Hotel, so I can't comment on the restaurant itself.",

This used to be my beloved Harvest Moon Grille, so I wanted to see if they do it justice, and overall, they did with a few miscues. So I really give this place 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 (I feel generous today).   Got the deviled egg appetizer. They added a FRIED pickle to the top....that was unexpectedly YUMMY! Then I got the sirloin over a mushroom risotto. Well, the beef was kind of \"sinewy\" and tough to chew in a few cases. About 5 or 6 oz of beef.....which was a little less that I was expecting for SIRLOIN....NOT the most expensive cut of meat. So the beef was average at best. But the risotto was very good. My friend got the roasted chicken leg, which she loved.....I thought it was good.  Didn't have time for dessert, but they all looked fabulous! I got a glass of wine and she got a Martini. Service was excellent and the atmosphere romantic and cozy.  Overall a pretty good place. Had they given me a BETTER quality piece of beef this would be a solid 4 star place. Right now it' s a solid 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "The fella and I stopped in for Sunday breakfast around 8:45, and we were the third group in there. We'd been excited to try the place that replaced Harvest Moon, and I was pleasantly surprised by the transformation! The interior looks very different with a long, ivory, leather booth along one wall, and dark, wooden tables throughout. The walls are dark blue on the top, and the art is very sleek and modern without being too fancy.  The menu was potentially even more impressive than Harvest Moon's, and I had a hard time deciding what to get! I decided on the House-Made Ricotta & Granola ($8) with a side order of toast. The baked apples were a delicious touch, and how has no one ever thought to add a dollop of ricotta to granola before?? Even the preserves that came with the thick, yet light, toast were to die for. The fella opted for the Pimento Cheese Omelet with grits ($9). He was dumb enough to give up a bite and let me try it, and the flavor was smoky with a nice tang from the cheese. The grits were sooo thick, and he loved it!  The only reason I didn't award a fifth star was service. When we first got there, it was perfect.  Around 9:00 a.m., they were so busy that there may not have been an open table in the place. I needed more coffee and more preserves, but our waitress never came back, and the others look super overwhelmed. Hopefully the staff will get the hang of things soon, and I'm looking forward to trying it again!",

It was good, just not great. I would prefer a creamier goat cheese on that salad as the whipped Chevre was almost a dessert consistency. Then I had what was probably the best beef ribs I've ever eaten. Delicious! I highly recommend them.  Would I dine at The Asbury again?

Also, the volume is high for a fancier spot. Wine list was well-curated. I'd give it another try next time in town.",

The manager was kind enough to give us gift cards for our next visit which most likely won't happen. As someone who worked in the service industry, I have pretty normal expectations and would not recommend this place to my friends or family.",

They tell you the source of everything (mostly local) before you order it and give you a piece-by-piece breakdown of everything when they bring you the plate. The service is impeccable. The quality and ease of our waiter's wine and food suggestions indicate the staff here really take passion in the dining experience Asbury provides and are all very familiar with the menu.   Per our waiter's recommendation, we started with the Duck Confit, which came out as tender little rolls around pickled apple relish that were great. My wife had the Scallops, which were cooked perfectly amid golden rice and pickled beets. But one of the most amazing dishes I've had to date are the Pork Cheeks. The meat was bursting with flavor and one of the most tender, fall-off-the-bone cuts I've had; really impressive.   If we are ever in Charlotte again I would love to come back for a Chef's tasting, brunch or another delicious dinner.",

Super moist chicken meat and doesn't feel to fatty while eating it.  It's super simple and equally as delicious.  Our waitress was a nice young woman who filled our water glasses practically after each sip. I loved it.   I also remembered this place after being at taste of Charlotte this past summer.

I live in Los Angeles but grew up in Virginia and went to school in the Shenandoahs, and, as much as I love where I came from, I think we can do better in the way of food. The Asbury is already doing just that.  I was invited to the Asbury for a business lunch and actually ate there again mere hours later because I had to try their dinner menu. The disappointing thing about the Asbury is not the Asbury. It's that no one seems to be ordering their best dishes. I visited at the end of June, and I had the most superlative tongue dish of my life, ox tongue with raclette: intensely beefy fatty beef with intensely melty cheesy cheese. I've had tongue a thousand times. (Realistically, a hundred times.) And this was pleasant upon pleasant, a southern \"bitch, please\" to the trend of smothering vinegars and citruses on beautiful meats and their rightful fats. (Bless their hearts.) My server said no one ever ordered it.  SIGH. I think the Asbury is west-coast-worthy but more than that it's east-coast-worthy if only the east coast would accept it as its own and eat the whole menu. Hint hint.",

We ordered two pitchers of mimosa which were pretty good and maw maws cast iron biscuits and deviled eggs to start. I ordered the chicken and waffles as my entree and wasn't impressed. The chicken was nicely seasoned but not crispy and the waffles were soggy. The syrup they give you is more like honey, and I don't enjoy honey on my waffles. Additionally the plate is topped off with sauteed greens (collard greens I think?) that were strangely sweet. My friend ordered the Mac and cheese which was tasty so I ate some of that instead. For the price the Asbury charges, I expected better quality food. On the bright side, our server was really friendly and attentive. If I'm in the area again, maybe I'll give the Asbury another try and order something different.",

The noise level was quite loud and everytime I've dined here I've been uncomfortably warm which it very unusual for me.  I love the decor and large window to the street. Our server was very attentive and the food came out fairly quick.   I wasn't as impressed with the food compared to their dinner menu. Everything sounded great but unfortunately it was just ok for me when I tasted it. I kept thinking about things to add to the dish that would make it better. I got the crab cake Benedict. I didn't even taste the crab cake and I prefer a more zesty hollandaise. The flavors didn't really pair well with the heavy biscuit underneath. I also tried my husband's chicken sandwich. It was pretty good but again I kept thinking it lacked a punch. Perhaps a spicy aioli. The French press was really good and we got the sticky biscuits as and app. Unfortunately they were too doughy for my tatse. You cant go wrong with the maw maw biscuits. I think from now on I'll stick to dinner.",

    "text": "I am going into this review letting you know I am already biased. It's high-class dining, which means--as a vegetarian--there are never many options. So I can not fairly rate them on all their food. But for vegetarians out there: this review is for you.   It's a fine dining facility in the floor of a hotel. So the atmosphere is relaxed (even though it tries to be fancy). You can never be fully \"fancy\" when you have people walking around in the lobby in front wearing jammies and fluffy slippers. It does a good job playing the part of fancy though.   The drink menu is great, good quality drinks. Well made, and local wines. The wine sampler is a great touch.   The menu is very unique, and like any upscale dining facility, expensive. But you get what you pay for. Very unique, quality ingredients, made from local ingredients.   With all the positive, why onlu give it 3 stars? Well, like I said, this is based on the quality of the food as a vegetarian. I had their deviled eggs, which were only ok. Nothing unique, but this was the only vegetarian app on the menu at the time. They did not have anything veg on the main menu, but they were willing to work with me to make some unique. Which was nice of them, for sure. However; when I got my dish it was basic and bland. Just roasted vegetables with no flavor. $26 for a plate of vegetables is a little much.   Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes well enough. There was nothing people were \"over the moon\" about, but no one had a bad experience either. Overall it was decent, but not a great place for a variety of people/preferences. Their menu is too niche that doesn't feed to a large number of people.",

The first time I went to this restaurant for dinner, about 3 weeks back, the service was terrible and the noise level was absurd so we left after 10 minutes, before we even got our drinks. They then called and offered me a gift card to come back and I accepted. Today I used said gift card and was once again disappointed. Upon arriving we waited for at least 10 minutes before someone came to our table after I made eye contact with at least 2 of the waitresses who were just standing around talking by the kitchen. We then got our biscuits and the bacon jam was terrible. I have had bacon jam multiple times and I don't know if it was meant to be sour but it tasted like it had almost gone bad. Our food was mediocre. Nothing I would go back for, I had a burger and my date the fried chicken sandwich. Since we did not have time to finish our meal we had to get to go boxes. My date asked for a container for his soup, which was piping hot and they gave him a round plastic container that had CLEARLY been used previously...watermarks and all. I am disappointed and even if they offered me another gift card I would ask them to please keep it.",

    "text": "The waiter was super knowledgable but needs to learn to respond to diners question instead of giving a sermon on the menu. Contain his enthusiasm....  I had the devil eggs to start, great flavor and the fried pickle on top was the best I have had in a southern restaurant! My main course was a locally sourced Lamb Chop, it was cooked a perfect medium rare, it had a sumptuous amount of fat surrounding the meat, great flavor in the actual fat! I am thankful for our friend bringing us here before Lewis Black. We will return.",

    "text": "The Asbury is one of my favorite restaurants here in Charlotte. Quaint, inventive menu, high-quality ingredients, and intimate.  Farm-to-Table concept with an added element of that theme being as most of the meat that they serve comes straight from the Chef de Cuisine's Family Farm. Dinner is Great and brunch is amazing!",

My only issue was that there were a ton of small flies flying around outside that were getting annoying.  But hey, it's summer, it's Charlotte, these things happen.  Overall - 4 stars.  Solid.",

    "text": "I think they tried... they really tried, but failed to execute. The flavors were bland and nothing distinctive. Dishes lacked dimension and balance. The food came out lukewarm. The staff did come over to inquire about how they could improve and I hope the chef takes my comments into consideration. There's potential there, but it seems like these dishes are experimental and not worthy of a final presentation.",
