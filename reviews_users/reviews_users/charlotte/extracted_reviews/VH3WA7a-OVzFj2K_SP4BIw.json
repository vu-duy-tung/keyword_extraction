I had sides of collard greens and potato salad with it when I misunderstood a mumbling waiter that sides were al a carte.  The collard greens were excellent!  The potato salad was a bust.  The calabash fish, fries and slaw were good but not extraordinary.  BTW, the mumbling waiter was a nice guy and the misunderstanding was as much a result of my old ears as his mumbling.  I'd eat here again.",

The fact that it is located at the intersection and the restaurant looks semi-classy with a nice outdoor patio attracted me.   I ordered their famous fried chicken (a recommendation from a lot of people from Yelp, and the waitress) and Stella for beer.   Honestly, I was not too impressed. The fried-chicken tasted dry (not juicy enough for me). Maybe because I live right across the border from Kentucky, but Kentucky does have the best fried chicken in the world.  This review is based on their famous fried chicken, but I would like to go back and try other stuff on their menu, their entree list looked pretty but a little pricey...more reviews to come!",

    "text": "I've wanted to visit this restaurant for months now. My gf and I went here the other night and, unfortunately, it was a disappointment.   We walked in on Fri night and stood right next to the hostess for a good minute. She knew we were there, nothing was said to us, and she just kept talking to the waiter. Now, one minute is much longer than it sounds when you walk in and expect to be greeted by someone. Bad taste in our mouths immediately. Not major, just something we both thought was strange.   We got a nice table, good place to hear the live jazz (we're both Jazz lovers!). The waiter informed us that they were out of the pot roast. No biggie. She ordered the Salmon; I ordered the fried chicken meat & three. I ordered Mac-n-Cheese, fried cabbage, and mashed potatoes & gravy.  5 minutes later, the waiter informed us that they were out of Salmon. Small to medium biggie. She ordered something else and we drank some wine.   A solid 40 minutes later, our food comes out. Major biggie.   Hers looks great. Out of the three sides I ordered, two were wrong. Mac-n-cheese was there, but I got collard greens instead of cabbage and black eyed peas instead of mashed potatoes. Large biggie.   I'm the LAST person to complain in my family and, even when I do, I am the most polite complainer anywhere around. Just get the order right, that's all. Overall, the food was great. That's why I am annoyed - because the food was great and the service wasn't. It's a shame to have great food and several things happen along the way that makes the customer not want to return which, sadly, may be the case with us. Along with the food mistakes, etc., our waiter was completely frantic the entire night. Just didn't give us a good vibe in there.   Looks like there's some work to do for this kitchen.",

The chicken had been cooked ahead of time, not crispy, soggy on bottom from sitting around. You get your choice of sides if they didn't runout of it. I had the green beans, they should  have told me they were from a can, so disgusting. The mac & cheese was lumpy and not hot. The slaw was ok. The waiter didn't know what beers they had, he went and asked. He poured my beer in a glass until the foam was overflowing onto the table. This restaurant is a joke!

Slow, nonexistent at times, with multiple servers running around confusing us.  When I asked to see the dessert menu (great desserts, too, pecan pie made of pecans and not corn syrup!) I was presented the lunch menu, without the explanation that the prices were up to $3 cheaper than the dinner menu prices (which was what I was charged, of course).   Overall, just inadequate service, especially in light of how many busybodies there were running around and IGNORING us as we sat in the middle of the room trying to draw someone, ANYONE's attention to order.   Again, great food, great price.. and so I might try it again, but maybe I can get a buzzer or a card or something to hold up so my server can claim me.",

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we had a private room reserved.  Although fancier than the traditional \"meat and three,\" it is still just that, so dont go expecting something very gourmet.  Likes:  Pleasant atmosphere, attentive waiter who obviously takes a lot of pride in his job, the food was all great (the appetizers, meat, and the sides were all delicious).  Dislikes:  Parking.  We parked in a garage and walked.  And then it rained on our heads.  But I guess that's what happens in downtown Charlotte.  Take it or leave it:  Take it.  Fun place with good food for an good cause.  I'm willing to support anyone who has a different business model than the traditional restaurant.",

    "text": "We don't get to eat uptown too often since we work near the airport.  However, we made a special trip to the King's Kitchen today with a group of 10 people (we made reservations).  You probably know that The King's Kitchen is a non-profit restaurant owned by Charlotte chef and minister Jim Noble.  The restaurant began with no debt; it was all paid for which helps them give more back to people.  In a place serving mostly southern style food, I had to get sweet tea, which is not one of my faves.  However, if all sweet tea tasted like this, I'd probably drink it much more often.  We ordered some pimento cheese for an app, which was a decent size scoop but served with only about 5 crackers.  This wasn't a problem when the made-from-scratch biscuits and cornbread came out though.  They tasted great by themselves, but they were also good with the cheese.  I make pimento cheese often, and prefer mine with more of a kick of hot sauce, but this cheese was still very good.  I got the pan-fried all natural chicken with white meat.  The chicken was slightly dry (because white meat often is) but the breading made up for it.  It tasted like they used panko and that stuff is awesome.  The meat comes with three sides for lunch, so I got mac and cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, and fruit.  The sweet potatoes were awesome and so was the mac and cheese.  Everyone ordered a variety of items and everyone really liked what they got (keep in mind more than half of this group are native southerners and two are even native to Charlotte).  The pineapple upside down cake was also moist sweet, and delicious.    It took a little bit to get our checks, but that's a minor issue.  It's a rare occurrence when a restaurant gets our group's order 100% correct and even rarer when everyone loves their food.",

    "text": "Anyone who says it's tough to screw up fried chicken obviously hasn't made much of it....or eaten any \"bad\" fried chicken. Thank goodness the fine folks at King's Kitchen have that dish down pat!   I have been waiting to head over to this nonprofit phenom for quite some time and finally got a chance to grab some dinner here. I'll put it out there right now - I love the concept of a nonprofit restaurant. I love the idea of feeding those who are without and putting people to work who are in transition. Now that that's clear, let's focus on the food & experience.   The restaurant hosts clean lines, bright walls and nice lighting. Hubs and I chose to sit out on the patio and enjoy a late dinner. Our waiter, Stuart, was incredibly friendly and led us through the menu with ease. A few glasses of wine later, we were ready to order. As mentioned, I chose the fried chicken with roasted carrots and mac & cheese. The bird was perfectly crispy and super juicy - honestly, it rivals my grandmother's fried chicken and that's say a whole lot. The carrots had the perfect amount of sweetness and were by no means overcooked. And lastly, the mac and cheese was heart attack worthy and delightful. Price wise, I think $13 was a completely fair (and affordable) price for this plate of food. The portions aren't gargantuan, but they are plenty large for the price!   We finished off the evening with strawberry shortcake - made with biscuits, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. While the treat was refreshing and tasty, the biscuits were a bit stiff and the portion was on the smaller side. Thus, I need to come back and try the coconut chess or chocolate pie. Oh woe is me.   I'm looking forward to coming back for another royal dinner at King's Kitchen...if I were to grab lunch here I may fall into an afternoon food coma!",

I don't eat sausage, but the catfish was very nicely breaded and fried. I could have stood a bit more seasoning. The carmel cake was also to die for.   Our server (don't think he ever gave his name) was nice, but perhaps a bit too \"busy\" as it was hard to flag him over sometimes.

Sure if something is soupy that makes sense for the integrity of the dish. Kings Kitchen serves your heaping of sides on a gigantic plate with your main (for the most part).   This is food like if your momma could cook. Service was attentive without being overbearing. We felt taken care of and also had time to have a long conversation.   We both had the dark meat fried chicken that comes with three sides for $13. A very generous portion.   The mashed potatoes were dynamite and I'm not a gravy fan, these worked. The green beans are cooked with pork, they are smokey and savory. Creamed corn was sweet and did the job.   Nice to see glasses of wine for $7 and $8 on the menu.   My first world gripe? No valet parking on a recent week night. Tons of lots and decks spitting distance away through.",

Most of their staff is part of the program.  Not only is this a restaurant with a great cause behind it, the food is delicious also! The owner of King's Kitchen also owns Rooster's, so I'm not surprised that the food is top notch. They have a variety of classic Meat and Three options with fresh ingredients and home cooked flavor.   My only gripe is that they ran out of fried chicken before 7:30!

    "text": "I meant to give two stars for the ambiance and service.  Based on the many positive Yelp reviews and the socially conscience message of the restaurant to provide for those that are less fortunate, a friend and I dined at King's Kitchen.  We arrived at 5:00 pm, the restaurant was practically empty with only three patrons which to me meant we would have the best service.  Outdoor dining is provided and absolutely I love dining al fresco, so we ate on the covered patio.  The restaurant is lovely with lots of windows so the natural light just flows in, the decor is simple and rustic but very inviting, the windows feature transparent recipes that is eye-catching and clever but that is where the compliments end.  I looked online at the menu and photo gallery to get an idea of what was offered.  The menu had several options that I liked and the photo gallery featured delicious looking food that I could not wait to try.  While the service was okay, the food was horrible.  I ordered sweet tea and thought I was going to get a sugar high.  It was entirely too sweet, someone must have put in a bag of sugar.  I asked for a glass of ice to temper the sweetness which helped.  We ordered biscuits which were heavy, thick and dry but for the accompaniments of butter, honey and jam, followed by long swallows of our beverage the biscuits would not have been eaten.  The biscuits were described by the server as light and fluffy, they weren't.    I was torn between the salmon, catfish and fried chicken as an entree but ultimately decided on fried chicken - white meat with two orders of macaroni and cheese, green beans and cornbread.  The macaroni and cheese was the worst I've ever had, it was runny as if it wasn't completely baked, the pasta was al-dente; it should have been allowed to cook longer.  I traded plates with my friend because the macaroni and cheese was so fluid that it spread, it began to touch my chicken and corn bread.  My friend also ordered macaroni and cheese as a side but his was in a small bowl, so I took that but it was the same only compact so that it was not fluid.  I sent the macaroni and cheese back for mash potatoes and gravy.  It was worse than the macaroni and cheese.  The potatoes which I believe were Yukon gold were either waterlogged from sitting in water or cooked too long and absorbed too much water because they looked gummy and had a sticky texture, and the gravy was bland with a heavy taste of flour.  The cornbread was heavy, incredibly dry and bland even after putting butter on it.  I ate the chicken and green beans.  Although the chicken was fine, it needed to be moist and I found myself using the flour tasting gravy to dip the chicken.  My friend ate about three forkfuls of the macaroni and cheese before he gave up on it.  He had the catfish and said it was bland but he could tolerate it.  He also had the potato salad what was not good and did not bother to finish it.  The online photo gallery showed amazing desserts, so we both ordered coconut cake.  When it was served, it looked beautiful with tall stacked mini-cakes, coconut icing and a drizzle of something.  However, at first bite it was incredibly cold, as if it was stored in the freezer, taken out to defrost and topped with fresh icing and drizzle of something.  I love coconut and would have devoured that cake but it was disgusting.  I asked for it to be removed from the bill.  My friend said his was too cold but would take it home to eat at room temperature, he threw it away.  What a waste of $10.00 for something that he did not eat because of the taste.  I cannot cook well and enjoy eating out but when the meal is horrible like this, I have become more patient at learning to cook at home whether than waste time and money at a restaurant with subpar food.  We did speak to the manager about our experience, he removed the charge of my dessert and I thought he said he credited my meal but he didn't.  Instead of addressing the matter, we just paid and left, never to return again.  I also learned from the server, that Rooster's Wood-fire Kitchen is its sister restaurant.  Rooster also has a lot of good reviews and was on my list of restaurants to try.  However, out of fear that the food will be subpar as with King's Kitchen, I will stay away from Rooster's.",

We had the crab cake and pimento cheese plate as appetizers- both were fabulous. Two of us got vegetable plates. The Mac and cheese, corn, and green beans were our favorites. The cornbread is also great. The shrimp and grits was spicy and tasty. We finished with the coconut cake-yum. Great place!!",

I ordered the Pot Roast and a large piece of meat came that I pushed apart easily with my fork.  It was cooked perfectly and it came with three sides.  The creamed corn was amazing.  My colleagues ordered the shrimp and grits and the ravioli and loved both of them.  The service was a little slow but they were busy with everyone from the tradeshow staying at the Marriott, so I'll let that go.  We didn't know anything about the mission of the business until we noticed the large cross in the kitchen and then started noticing the other subtle things around the restaurant.  They are upfront about their mission but not in your face, which is nice, so they're not going to turn anyone away.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!",

Glad we made a reservation as the place was packed on Saturday at 730pm.   Started with the crab cakes, which were a bit small but delicious. Biscuits & cornbread were nothing to write home about. For mains we had a Red Snapper than came with a creamy sauce and farro that I really liked although the fish was a little bit overcooked. The Shrimp and Grits were the BEST we have had anywhere. The grits were the perfect consistency for soaking up the spicy sauce that came with it. We finished with a bread pudding that was well worth the wait: the bread was super fresh and the custard was among the best we've had.   Service was great, would definitely come back here.",

From the relativley modern and simple yet solemn interior design to the wonderful group of people who make our visit such a delightful event. The location is also super convenient from all sides of Uptown - for those of you who aren't in Charlotte, that's our downtown.   Today I had the salmon for dinner and it was just great. I love salmon in many different forms and enjoy various sorts of recipes. Unfortunately, as we all know, not all places do it good enough. The King's Kitchen was on point. Not too mushy and not too dry inside covered with seasoned and (most importantly) crispy outer layer for an excellent experience. I cannot end today's review without mentioning the mushrooms. Yes, they were perfect. Last but not least, the lady who brought extra pimento cheese for our baguette, you rock. The manager was super quick and smart too. Keep it up!  There is a unique story behind this place which I will save for all of you readers to go find out for yourselves. You will like it just for that, and love it for the tuna sandwiches, the salmon, and their amazing desserts.",

I arrived with two other friends at about 8:30 on a Wednesday, so the restaurant was almost empty. We were served promptly and our waitress Kristen was very attentive. She served us classic southern sweet tea and was prompt with refills.  We got sweet potato fritters, which had a unique taste, but very enjoyable. Two of us got the fried chicken with three sides and cornbread ($13), which was an awesome deal. The mashed potatoes & gravy and the creamed corn were absolutely delicious. The fried chicken was pretty good, but somewhat dry. The green beans and mac n cheese were also above average, but nothing spectacular. However, the cornbread was terrible. It had clearly been made and cut that morning or prior to; it was dry and stale on the outside and the inside was tasteless.   In general, I had a nice time but I would like to return when it was a little more busy, due to the fact that the restaurant is pretty large and it felt like nobody was there. Also, I would skip the cornbread and perhaps order a dessert, because what we saw in the dessert counter looked delicious.",

You've heard the rumors, and they're all True. The King's Kitchen is a non-profit restaurant that has good food, good business model, and it benefits the local community. Job training program combines with feeding the hungy. Excellent customer service, and well executed food don't hurt either. All for a reasonable price. And the ambiance is clean and casually upscale. Jeans would fit in and so would suits. Plasma TVs on mute keep is a little casual, as do the servers in jeans.   First, our waiter (who had a very unique name that is escaping me but he was awesome) was informative, friendly, and funny. He explained the mission of the restaurant and made some recommendations that were all excellent.    APPS Deviled eggs were pretty standard but an excellent way to start the meal. Cornbread was phenomenal! I hauled this cornbread back to Washington DC to eat it, it was that good. The biscuits are also stellar, but I'm a cornbread girl.   MAIN COURSE Pan fried chicken. Although I do like the crispiness of deep fried chicken, this pan fried one was well seasoned, moist and tasty. Mac n cheese was a little too creamy, but was devoured before anything else on the plate. Greens were good. My companions heartily enjoyed their oxtail and potroast.  Beer and wine selection was excellent (I got a pint of Fat Tire, and there were some tempting wines on the list too)  DESSERT I don't really like bananas. And I don't really like pudding. But their banana pudding was pretty tasty!  Overall, I had good food and a wonderful time at King's Kitchen without breaking the bank. Now just open a branch in DC!",

I would have said, \"Good food, Good Service and Great Prices and I recommend everyone should try this place at least once\".    Unfortunately, as Cara said in a previous review, something has happened to the Kings kitchen over the last year.  I do not know what has happened, but the prices have increased and the portions and food no longer meet the expectations that Kings kitchen once met.    Today I ordered the Grilled Chicken wrap with fries, the other people that were with me got a Grilled Chicken wrap as well and a turkey sandwhich.  The wrap was mostly all lettuce and a 1/2 of a breast of chicken (the other person at the table got the other half).  This was not an $11 wrap.  The Turkey sandwhich had, at most, 3 pieces of Turkey on it, but plenty of lettuce.  All 3 of us got fries and they were greasy and soggy.  The other 2 people like their fries this way, so that is neither a positive or negative to kings kitchen.    I hope kings Kitchen can fix whatever has broke and get back to the way it was.

She took good care of the table without breathing down our necks every few minutes. We had fried oysters for the table, the breading was awesome, I really enjoyed them.  Also, locally crafted beers and ciders, and wines, however they \"do not have spirits\" so just a heads up. We all got a cup of the gumbo, I've never actually had gumbo before, so I don't know if it's truly authentic, but it was truly delicious!   I had the pan fried chicken, it comes with three sides. The sides and specials are seasonally based, since everything is sourced locally I believe, so they didn't have a few options, but the Mac and cheese, slaw, and green beans, which are cooked with bacon, were good. The chicken was awesome, right amount of breading, very juicy.  Three people in our group got the pot roast and it was a big hit!  The other two got the NY strip, which I think was the special of the night. Both stated it may have been the best steak they ever had.  We found ourselves wanting to return quickly to try the other menu items, so we will be back!",

    "text": "Before I talk about the food, I think it's important to note what this place is.  It is a not for profit restaurant and the proceeds go towards local organizations that help the poor and needy in the community.  Additionally, the restaurant gives jobs to folks who are considered to be \"un-employable\" due to troubled pasts.  All this is done under the auspices of religion.  Whether or not you are a religious person, the cause is noble and sincere.  And they don't shove it down your throat, they just serve you good food and treat you well while doing it.    So, on to the restaurant itself.  It's in a really cool location on the corner of Trade and Church that you cannot miss.  Lots of windows make it very attractive.  The atmosphere is very casual and comfortable.    When we arrived, we were seated at a table that was awkwardly placed against a wall right under a mammoth flat screen TV.  That part was a little disappointing but no major issue.  Our waitress was kind, attentive, and offered good recommendations.  There were all sorts of delicious looking down-home dishes on the menu.  I went with the fried catfish which was pretty excellent I must say.  It was served up with mushrooms, sweet potato puree, and corn pudding.  The portions were good sized but not enormous, so I didn't leave feeling like I ate half of Charlotte.  There were really tasty looking desserts to pick from (pecan tart, a truffle trio, banana pudding, coconut cake, etc.).  We went with the caramel cake which was accompanied by a dollop of coffee ice cream.  That thing didn't stand a chance!  Cool atmosphere, good food, friendly staff, all backed by a humanitarian cause.",

    "text": "What everyone else said and then some! Given the mission statement of this restaurant and being a sucker for comfort food, I've been wanting to check out this place since I read about it in the Charlotte Observer. I went for lunch yesterday-at 11:40A when we got there, there were maybe 3 tables occupied-when we left at 12:20P, the place was packed with a waiting list. This is in Charlotte-on a work weekday-what??! I love it and happy this place is here and thriving. There has been some turnover in this location since I've lived in Charlotte and it looks like this one will stay around for awhile.  I've heard fabulous things about all of the food---especially the chicken and flounder. You can choose a meat and choose three sides to go with it -most for under $10 which is a fantastic deal given the amount of food you could get. Our server was sweet, talkative and full of suggestions. She told us the meatloaf sold out each day so if we wanted to order it make sure we get there early. The special yesterday was Chicken Fried Chicken, which the other seven people in my group ordered. I was going to go with that but remembered reading Demetria M's review of the flounder. I decided to be a loner and order that along with collards, slaw and mac n cheese. If I'm eating comfort food, I'm going all out. Noshed on some biscuits before our meal came out (which seemed like it took 5 mins) and I am not a huge cornbread person but the others in my group said it was out of this world. The flounder was light, buttery and flaky and the tartar sauce was phenomenal!!! I think it was the best I've ever had and reminded me of a chunky aioli sauce rather than a traditional tartar. The mac n cheese, slaw and collards? Gone within five minutes. Everyone in my group received a membership to the clean plate club yesterday and I left without feeling the need to put on my fat pants. I cannot wait to visit again and will be saving room for their desserts--they all sound delicious.",

Very solid comfort-food offerings, that mostly seemed to be at the appropriate price point for what's given.    I do remember that the first biscuits sent out were room temperature and seemed stale, but the waitress saw I had only picked at mine, and brought more out - this time from a fresh, hot batch.  Much better.   I had Meat & 3: pot roast, butternut squash, collards and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were listed with gravy on the menu, but only came out with a dish of broth/au jus on the side. I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be the \"gravy\", or if that was for the pot roast and they just forgot the potato gravy all together? Anyway, it was decent and filling, and would have had leftovers if I'd cared to take them home.  Nothing too special though.  Pot roast was fork-tender though, I'll give it that.  Fiance ordered...some kind of fried fish, with tomato jam on a bed of cheesy grits.  His dish was definitely of a higher caliber than mine, more upscale, both in presentation and in flavor experience, but you could have told that in advance based on the menu descriptions and prices of our respective dishes.  This was our first visit, spurred on by an about-to-expire online coupon we'd purchased.  Overall the experience was fine, but we had a long wait before being seated, and the jazz duo/trio (?), which we were seated near, was a bit too loud to be able to converse and hear each other.  King's Kitchen was fine for one evening's eating adventure, but there are other restaurants in Charlotte that we have had consistently better experiences at, so this one is unlikely to enter our repertoire for future revisits.",

Today was my second trip here, and as I usually bring my lunch I occasionally forget lunch in uptown Charlotte can set you back about twenty bucks. You'd think I got ripped off for spending that much on a BLT.   You'd be wrong.   Firstly, King's Kitchen is non-profit and helps those trying to get back on their feet by giving them a good, steady job. That alone is worth a higher price tag.  From a strictly selfish perspective, however, let's talk about the sandwich, a 3.5\" high pile of heirloom tomato slices, baby field greens, thick slices of perfectly crisp bacon and Duke's mayo (because we are civilized southerners) between two slices of delicious toasted artisan bread.   I love tomato sandwiches but am persnickety as heck about my tomatoes. These heirlooms were perfect. I already want another one of these babies for dinner.   If the sandwich weren't enough, I also tried the mac and cheese, my favorite comfort food.  Shazam. Best I have had in the city. And the collards and butter beans my companions had looked delicious too.   Give King's Kitchen a try when you're hungry uptown. Not only will you be giving people a helping hand, you will also enjoy a darned good meal. This place is a Noble effort indeed.",

The crab cake appetizer was barely warm and completely tasteless with a strange lumpy sauce.  The cornbread was bitter and dry.  The greens were unpleasant with a bad aftertaste.  The potatoes were more runny than the gravy.  But the worst thing was the fried chicken which came out barely warm and completely dry. I had to drink a few swallows of water to even get my first bite down.    It is so hard to find decent fried chicken in Charlotte and this version definitely goes on the scrap heap.  Disappointing!",

The local Riesling was better than the expensive French blend recommended by the server and was also the only local white on the menu--surprising for a place that emphasizes using local. The cheese plate was decent but the cheeses didn't have a lot of diversity to them and there wasn't enough bread for the amount of cheese. The fried oysters tasted like butter and salt so I loved it (and skipped the mayonnaise with the fancy caper remoulade title that was definitely mostly just mayonnaise) but the sweet potato fritters also tasted like salt and butter which was very disappointing since they smelled like delicious cinnamon. Those little balls came with a fabulous sweet butter that I even got extra to go. The Shishido peppers were nothing special, also tasting like butter and salt without a hint of any of the things it was supposed to taste like such as lime.   We each liked our entrees and didn't like the other's entree. I had the duck confit porridge and love rice and leeks so that made my meal, although the butter and salt flavors were still unnecessarily strong. I took one bite of the cornbread and decided it also needed to be slathered in the sweet butter from the sweet potato fritters--a bit of honey would have been preferred option. Partner had the pot roast with the lima and black eyed beans. I found the piece of meat to be 1/3 fat rather than meat and wasn't a fan, but he liked the flavor, the beans, and the biscuit. Surprise: we both thought the dish could use less butter and salt flavor... His mac and cheese was great, though.   I did the corn something dessert but when it came out it was just generic vanilla sherbet balls with three tiny pieces of dehydrated corn. Hmmm.  The bill was upwards of $100 for two people and I think the only leftovers were two fritters and my cornbread. Given that we were made to sweat out on the porch where people walked by smoking and cars honking and we could clearly see open tables inside all night, I'm not considering this a good value fine dining experience. But it wasn't a disaster, either. Just... singularly focused on butter and salt.",

We went for lunch, on a beautiful day, and were able to sit outside.  Having read the \"share\"idea on the menu, and hearing that the portions are rather large, we ordered one fried chicken dinner for the three of us!  We ordered our 3 sides, mmm (especially liked the greens) and by mistake the waiter brought us a Mac and cheese that we hadn't asked for.  So we had 4 sides, and ordered an extra biscuit.  That was enough for us!!  Very good food, good value for money, and though it is not evident, a small contribution to a good cause..   calm atmosphere sitting on the patio.  Servers were all very friendly.... dessert - banana pudding - seemed rather pricey, and none of us were too excited about the marshmallow topping.. (sometimes it's all about what you're used to).  This restaurant is uptown, so either come by rail, or expect some parking difficulties during the day.",

The side biscuits are the perfect size to get a taste of their deliciousness but not fill up too much to enjoy your meal and save room for dessert. I was recommended by a friend to try the banana pudding. I don't know what other desserts they have without going to look at the menu, but it doesn't matter - this banana pudding is amazing! It's more of a custard than a typical pudding I've had in the past, and the toasted marshmallow topping completes the entire meal.   With the quick and friendly service from all the staff and the great food, I will make King's Kitchen a weekly visit!",

I ordered the pot roast which was very tender and not smothered in a ton of sauce.  The mashed potatoes are perfect. Then finished off with coffee and and a slice of apple pie.  Very delicious not too sweet, fresh and the coffee was better than the chain coffee shops. You would enjoy this place it's elevated southern food to a elegant level.",

    "text": "I planned a business dinner for out team in the Charlotte area and chose The King's Kitchen because of the great reviews and their mission to feed the hungry in the community.  Because of the size of our group - they required that we preset our menu and adjust the time of our event so our experience would be optimal.    When we walked in, the expansive bar area was just starting to fill up with dinner patrons.  They serve only beer and wine but the menus for both were varied and extensive enough to please everyone.    Our server was friendly and helpful - it took awhile to get things rolling, like our drink and app order, but once we did, the pace was ok.    The menu options included chicken, pot roast, vegetarian risotto and salmon.  I don't believe anyone ordered the risotto and I only heard feedback about the salmon (which was dry for a few that ordered it).  I had the pot roast which was a nice sized portion but was slightly chewy.  Everyone who had the fried chicken seemed to be pleased with their choice.  The sides were the highlight of the evening - we chose butter beans, mac 'n cheese and green beans.  The mac 'n cheese was slightly under seasoned for my taste but the pasta was cooked to perfection and the cheese was creamy in the center and appropriately crusty on the top.  I thought the butter beans were amazing and the green beans while a bit overcooked, were full of flavor.   We tried a few of the desserts - banana pudding and angel food cake to name a few.  All were tasty and came in generous portions.    Overall, everyone enjoyed the meal and the service.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The King's Kitchen but I'd probably try another dining spot in the Uptown area before I'd venture back.",

Well, we finally did and I am so glad that we did!!    We started out with the fried oysters as our app and they were... Kick A$$!!! (see pic).  They were huge with the perfect amount of crispiness and textured seafood gooey'ness on the inside.  They were accompanied by delicious cocktail sauce and a second balsamic vinegar dressing thing.. Never had that type of dipping sauce for oysters before but it sure worked!  I then moved on to the Fried Catfish and WOW!  It was excellent.  The perfect amount of herbs and spices in the batter mix complimented the an ideal flaky delicious fish.  I was blown away with the taste.  Not to mention, they gave us three side options for the entree.  I went with the collard greens, fried mac n' cheese, and the mashed potatoes.  I would highly suggest you do the same.  You cant go wrong with some collard greens.    My only issue would have to be the fact that they NAILED this dinner perfectly.  Now, I am going to go back and have to order the same thing and not try anything new.  I know, crazy frustrating, right?    Enjoy!!  -Ian M.",

However. for an entree I had the bone-in pork chop and it was fantastic!  SO incredibly juicy and flavorful.  I was a little surprised to see that of the 3 out of 4 people at my table that all ordered that, they were all a different size.  By quite a bit.  I was a little ticked that mine was the smallest by almost half of the gentleman's to my right.  I may be a lady, but I can eat and I am being charged the same.  They need to talk with their butcher or sell it market price by the ounce.",

    "text": "Sigh. I REALLY wanted to like this place. I've been wanting to try it for months, ever since I've been planning a trip to Charlotte for my mother and searching for the perfect dinner spot to meet her tastes. We arrived on a Friday evening around 5 and were promptly seated by a very courteous host. My mother ordered a vegetable plate (her standard order anywhere) and I ordered the white meat pan-fried chicken meal with green beans, macaroni and cheese, and potato salad, with cornbread as my bread option. It literally took less than five minutes to get our meals out, which was the first clue that disappointment was soon to follow. Five minutes is fine if you're just scooping vegetables onto a plate, but that short turnaround time told me my chicken was not going to be freshly cooked. And I was correct. The sides I ordered were great, but the chicken was so dry I had to take each bite with a sip of water. If I'm paying $15 for a chicken plate, it should not be so dry that I fear death by choking. Did I get the leftovers from lunch that had been dehydrating under the salamander all afternoon? Did patrons after me get fresh chicken, or is it always dry like this? I may never know, because the chances of me returning here are slim when Charlotte has so many great places to eat.",

Tried it for lunch today and am impressed with its mission of feeding the flock. But. (!)  It's a restaurant, so it's job should first be feeding its patrons. That where it totally fails. Cornbread was nasty and dry. Suitable as bird feed, but not for people. Meatloaf was dry and unpleasant too. Sides were below average.   Much better meal choice is to walk to Gus's and then donate $5 to your favorite charity.",

My two friends and I split two meat and three plates with collard greens, green beans, butter beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, and mac and cheese, an appetizer of fried oysters, a side of carmelized beets, and grilled cornbread. Everything was good, but the fried oysters and green beans were great! I also enjoyed a tasty IPA and banana pudding with toasted marshmallow topping for dessert. Yummy! Luckily, the restaurant was almost a mile from the hotel, so we had some time to walk off some of this great meal.  And best of all, this restaurant donates its profits to help the City's homeless and hungry. As they say on the menu, \"Eat chicken and feed somebody.\" Who could ask for more?",

I got the flounder with the Mac and cheese and my friend got the chicken plate with green beans(pork in it) and mushrooms.  My meal was pretty good, the Mac and cheese was exceptionally good which is always a hit and miss.(seasoned well). My flounder was breaded and pretty good, cannot complain.  My friend first received a burned chicken breast but was quickly and happily changed for another piece. I actually tried a piece of the chicken and it was very good. I'm a fan of mushrooms but they were very salty(for my friends liking).  I also had a biscuit and my friend had the cornbread, both were good.  For dessert my friend got the coconut cake, even though they expected a bigger piece it was good. Soft and moist. Would I come back to the Kings kitchen yes...",

    "text": "I really love the philanthropic concept of King's Kitchen; however, the food and service were both just average at best during my visit. We started with an appetizer of sweet potato fritters, and to be blunt- they were awful. They were way too salty and had way too much ginger and cloves; did not taste like sweet potatoes at all. If you like honey, they became edible by dipping them in the sweet honey sauce, but I would still definitely avoid them. For my entree, I ordered the pot roast meat and three with mac & cheese, collard greens, green beans, and a biscuit. The pot roast was exceptional - so tender and flavorful; you didn't even need a knife to eat it. The mac and cheese was pretty solid as well. It was baked custard style which I like but wasn't that cheesy. The collard greens and green beans were okay but nothing special. The biscuit was dry and crumbly but according to our server is a lot better than the cornbread. My girlfriend ordered the pork chop, but unfortunately it came out overcooked and a bit burnt on the one side. It was certainly edible, but not something you'd want to pay $25 for. Her side of \"fondant sweet potatoes\" was 5 slices of very thin sweet potato baked and with little seasoning or flavor. That leads me to my biggest disappointment- the portion size. My girlfriend isn't a big eater, but she was still hungry after her small pork chop and even smaller side dish. When I think of a classic southern \"meat and three\", I'm thinking that I'm going to be absolutely stuffed full of food and/or have some to take home, but the portions were really small. All three sides were small portions, and the pot roast was maybe 4-5 ounces of meat. Our server was a friendly guy, and I respect that they help the homeless recover by offering them jobs, but he did not check on us much at all once our food hit the table, and he seemed very confused every time we ordered, although luckily everything was correct. He also spoke very quietly so it was almost impossible for us to understand what the specials were or what he asked us that wasn't obvious.  I'm disappointed that I didn't love King's Kitchen since it is such an awesome concept but the food, service, and portion sizes were all letdowns for a $50+ dinner without drinks.",

    "text": "Hands down, one of the worst place I have been to... I have never been so disappointed. Service was horrible. Food was cold and mediocre. Was expecting a lot more.  It started with the waitress.. My bf and I sat outside to eat. I could NOT hear a single thing the waitress said or asked. She spoke so soft and quietly that it was impossible to hear her. I repeatedly asked her to speak up and repeat herself.  Secondly, we asked her a question about the menu and she seemed like she didn't know how to reply to our question so she just read everything word by word from the menu she took for me, after we ordered she questioned our orders... \"Are you sure you want that?\".. we said yes. She went in to enter in the order and about 5-10 mins later, she comes to our table and tells us that one of our orders was out for the night and we had to switch it out or something else. After we ordered our food, two tables came in. They got their orders before we did... waited 30 mins for our food. When the food finally came out, they brought it out to the wrong table...... the waiter brought it back in and a min later, brings it out to us. Half way into our food, our waitress came to ask us if we needed anything, I asked for straws and it took her 5 mins to get two straws.... I felt like the waitress just wanted to waste our time and she took her time for everything...  At the end of the meal, we asked for our check. She brings it out and stands next to us for a minute and waits for us to get our money... she just stood there while we took our payment out.. I mean normally your supposed to just leave it on the table and let the customers take their time with the check, but not her. When she returned the check to us, she slid the check on the table and said \"goodnight\" and just walked away... not even looking at us..  Food here is mediocre as stated before. We both got the fried chicken and it was cold and hard. They gave me half of a wing and counted it as 1 piece of chicken. The corn bread is hard and dry... mac and cheese have a very odd after taste.  I can not stop ranting about this place because of the horrible service I received.. I'm sorry, but you're honestly better off eating Bojangles. It is 20 better than this place.",

Three of us went for lunch there recently.  All of us left less than impressed.  First the good:   1.  The whole concept of the restaurant is wonderful!  Giving folks a second chance and giving them meaningful work experience is truly something that we all should strive to do. 2.  Our server was very friendly. 3.  The macaroni and cheese was excellent.  Now for the less than good: 1.  While he was quite friendly, our server was also very over-worked.  It took forever for him to take our order. 2.  None of us was overly impressed with the food.  One person had the meat loaf and she said it was dry.  Another had a chicken sandwich and the bread that it was on was seared, but came to the table quite cold. 3.  I had the veggie plate which, for $12, came with four veggies and a piece of cornbread.  I expected for that price the portions to be substantial.  They were not.  If anything, they each were a bit on the small side.  The black eyed peas and cabbage that I had were simply OK- nothing special about them at all.  I could not eat the collards.  They were way too salty.  As mentioned before, the macaroni and cheese was quite good.  But that really was the only high point of the dishes that we all had.  I really was wanting to give this restaurant and excellent review, but I am afraid I cannot.",

Then I came across a two page feature in the airline magazine about Jim Noble as being early on the farm to table movement after a trip to Napa and I knew I needed to make a point to try it.    The unassuming exterior opens to a nice clean restaurant.  I realized this was a little more then your average southern restaurant when I noticed seared scallops on the menu.  The meal started off with CORNBREAD <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3WA7a-OVzFj2K_SP4BIw?select=l4s1Iu-2W5TISJro27qCBA#0cz5dmpB3qdUTI3hk8JjrA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3W...</a> It was glistening as it came out, crisp on the top with corn kernels blended in.  Quite unique.   Ordered the FRIED OYSTERS with BACON VINAIGRETTE <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3WA7a-OVzFj2K_SP4BIw?select=l4s1Iu-2W5TISJro27qCBA#GPXXgS0bm80mU3SAmiruBA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3W...</a>  It crunched the fork.  Very good, both the bacon vinaigrette and the think and chunky cocktail sauce were excellent  MEAT and THREE (Choice of meat and three sides) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3WA7a-OVzFj2K_SP4BIw?select=l4s1Iu-2W5TISJro27qCBA#txgFhMazxsiXJkL6X6Pfkg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3W...</a> Had a hard time deciding between the catfish (single entree) and the flounder (Meat & three option).  The waiter recommended flounder it was very good as well...  crisp, crunchy and flavorful.  Got  collard greens, mac & cheese, Rosa's green beans. Rosa's greens beans were the best although my friend got the creamed corn which he said was the best.  PECAN PIE <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3WA7a-OVzFj2K_SP4BIw?select=l4s1Iu-2W5TISJro27qCBA#xjkMHhQLCOtB3wr4peIp5A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VH3W...</a> A classic southern dessert, also the waiters recommendation.  While I wouldn't say it was amazing the caramel sauce pulled everything together very well.  Aside from the great food, King's kitchen is a not-for-profit restaurant.  The profits go to feeding Charlotte's hungry and working with businesses, ministries, and non-profits to minister the gospel for Jesus Christ to helping to train troubled youth, rehab graduates and other members of the community who are in need of employment.  It's the kind of place that you feel good both about the food and the establishment as a whole. Will definitely be back and looking forward to trying out Rooster, Jim Noble's other restaurant.",

We left with our hearts warmed and our souls humbled when we find out their mission and purpose in supporting the Charlotte community.  The soul food is delicious, including the Fried Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Black Eyed Peas, Mushrooms, and Biscuits.  We ended our meal with their coconut cake which is a must try.  Definitely check this restaurant out when you have a chance, we loved it!",

OMG!!! 3) very good location, right in the heart of uptown.   The fried chicken sandwich will blow your mind. I mean, it is literally a giant fried chicken breast inside a sandwich with slaw and such..  I dare you to eat all that - I can't, but it's awesome.  I really like the chicken salad sandwich too.  And of course you can just be basic in the best way and order the fried chicken with some sides. The sides are classic southern fare. But they are SOOOOO yummy!  Collard greens, butter beans, cream corn. Like Mama makes, if Mama were a southern raised cook who knew how to make food taste sinful when it is something as innocent as beans or corn.",

    "text": "When visiting Charlotte for work, a local colleague took us to The King's Kitchen for dinner. The menu consisted of several traditional southern foods which sounded good. We actually all ordered the pan fried chicken, which comes with three sides. I selected the mashed potatoes, collard greens and a biscuit.   The chicken itself was amazing. Perfectly crispy. Amazing flavor, perfect texture. I devoured it. The biscuit was fabulous and ranks right up there with some that I loved in Nashville. I devoured it and wanted to order a second. The greens were awesome. Acidic and still crisp. Finally, the creamed potatoes with gravy were rich and creamy (as you'd expect by the name). I devoured them.   Also want to note that our service was impeccable. The waiter really knew the menu and food and he was super professional.   I highly recommend The King's Kitchen if you find yourself in Charlotte and you're hungry.",

    "text": "Things to know: - The chicken is so/so - The collard greens are really good - The macaroni and cheese is okay - The cornbread is salty - The potato salad is bland - Service is quick though  I walked in to get food to go today. I ordered Aunt Beaut's Pan Fried Chicken with macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and potato salad, and cornbread.   The collard greens were so good. In the past, I've ordered them at restaurants and they tasted spicy. I was worried these would be as well, but they weren't. They were perfect.  The chicken was okay. I had a chicken breast and a wing. The wing was good and the breast was a little dry. As I was eating it, I dipped it in the collard green juice and thought about the following meme. LMBO.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvids.onsizzle.com%2Fwhen-the-juice-from-the-greens-touches-your-cornbread-24020469.mp4&s=594167d954e4ca7ff7d70bd85304dfb279fed14e16030001a62b911c2e41658c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vids.onsizzle.com/when-t...</a>  Back to the review...  The macaroni and cheese was okay. I've had better. The cornbread is what I was really looking forward to, only it turned out to be pretty salty. I wasn't expecting that.   The potato salad tasted like it came straight from the tubs they sell at Food Lion. It was missing something.   I'd be willing to give them another try and order a different meal. The only thing I'd order again is the collard greens.  Service is quick though. I think I got my food within 10 minutes of ordering it. I also love the fact that they feed the poor.",

My husband had the fried chicken w/ greens, corn, Mac & cheese + corn bread. Our friend had the Duck + side salad and I had the gumbo + corn bread. We all thought our food was delicious. But I wasn't really a fan of the corn bread. The bathroom was clean and the staff was pleasant; the manager for the night seemed really nice. Our server was a little dry at first and then he started to come around and I ended up really liking him. We ended up getting banana pudding for dessert and it was average. The price was moderate. I would say the parking is difficult if you are trying to get street parking but there are parking garages near by. Overall so grateful that we decided to have dinner.",

To our surprise they actually have Sunday church service which we thought was pretty cool especially in a big city. We ordered appetizers, we got the crab dip and as odd as it may sound, I asked for their potato salad as an appetizer. I love potato salad and it's really hard to find any without onions, when I asked and they responded that there weren't any onions in it....my selection was over. I tasted the potato salad first and I soon realized, the amount wasn't going to be enough, I was the second best potato salad (my favorite is my own homemade) i didn't even get a chance to take a picture of our apps bc they were so good. The crab dip was good. I will say they did inform me that it contained er onions but I was fine bc they are cooked however, the dip did have a strong onion flavor, it didn't slow me down! The shrimp and grits were very good, the grits were very creamy, just how I like them. The one downfall was the shrimp still had the tails intact which I do not prefer. My husband had the porkchop and he said it ranked in his top 3 of pork chops, he said the mushrooms were \"real\" mushrooms, which he said was awesome. And bc I only let him have a bite of my potato salad, he ordered his own and agreed with me on how good it was, and i stole a bite or two of his too lol. Great place, wishes they were open on the weekend for lunch bc we are only in Charlotte for the weekend bc o would come back for every meal!! A++ experience and food!!",

We made a reservation online and they were limited on time slots, but we got there early and they sat us right away...and there were plenty of tables available. We sat at a kinda smallish table outside...not the greatest but we got over it. We tried a few local beers and our waiter was great at explaining the drink options.  For dinner, two of us got the chicken and waffles, one of us got the ribs, and I got the fried chicken with garden peas, fries, and mac and cheese with a biscuit. The chicken and waffles was incredible!! My cousin was floored with how good it was. My other cousin said the ribs were some of the best that he has ever had...and ribs are popular where he is from. They were so tender he was able to slide the bones out cleanly and eat it with a fork and knife so he didn't look like a savage (his words). My fried chicken was on point! I've had it before and just love it. The sides were just alright. The biscuit was soooooo good and the fries were great, but the other sides were just okay.  The food came out very quickly....perhaps too quickly? We were in and out in less than 45 minutes. But the food was tasty and the waiter was very friendly. I'll definitely be back!",

I had the Fried Chicken Sandwich with coleslaw on top and it was the best restaurant style chicken sandwich I've ever had.  For my side I had the mashed sweet potatoes and they were almost as amazing.  The only downside here is that I was uncomfortably full for quite a while afterward.  Inside was quite amazing as well and offered a very large dining area very meticulously decorated almost as if it was a Crate and Barrel department store.  I was very impressed all around and cannot wait to be back for dinner in the near future!    Food:  9/10 Atmosphere:  10/10 Service:  8/10 Value:  8/10    Will return!",

When we arrived we were seated right away. There were a few tables occupied but it wasn't very busy at the moment. Our waitress came immediately and took our drink orders. As we reviewed the menu we wanted everything!! My friend settled on the Crab Dip & Pan Fried Chicken with Biscuit, Mashed Potatoes & Butter Beans, while I ordered the Crab Cake & Pan Fried Chicken with Corn Bread, Mac&Cheese, Green Beans & Collard Greens. Both of us were very pleased with our meal. The chicken was fried & seasoned just right, like your grandma fried it. The Mac&Cheese was my favorite. It's not often I visit a restaurant that makes it like my mom and leaves me leaving more but they accomplished this rare task. It was very cheesy and not watery and not dry, just perfectly baked with a nice crispy top & edges from the cheese, YUM!!! Everyone knows that the top is the best part of Mac&Cheese when it's made right and this was no different, I saved it for last as if I was home lol. The Collard Greens were perfect for me. Some may not like them because they had a bit of sweetness to them (Brown sugar), but I typically add sugar to my collards anyway. They cook those and the green beans in pork. Speaking of the Green Beans, those were the one thing that I did not like at all. My friend tasted them and we both tried to figure out where they went wrong. I could have been the seasoning because they were pretty bland. But there was still something off with the taste, as if the pork was bad or something. Anyway, I just swapped them out for more Mac&Cheese and I was happy again. You could tell the corn bread was REAL no Jiffy Mix here. I'm not a bread person so I like my corn bread to have a hint of sweetness to it. But those who love real corn bread will like this. It wasn't dry at all. The appetizers were also awesome. I'd order both again. Our waitress was also great! Very attentive. We were so excited when our food came that forgot to take pics lmbo. But i'll definately be returning soon & often. There are other items I need to give a try.",

Hubby and I had pot roast, mac&cheese (amazing), green beans, collards, pot roast, and Charlotte Red Rice. All the flavors were great, though the Red Rice portion was small for the price. I love this restaurant most because of their not-for-profit mission to feed the poor and job-training for those who need a new start at life. They are good folks!",

The positives:  Very friendly staff, the purpose of the restaurant is wonderful, the collard greens are amazing, decent wine selection, and the willingness of the management to talk to you about things not working with your meal.    The not-so positives:    Spare ribs should be tender where they should be easy to pick off the bone.  These were very tough and I was fighting with them with the butter knife.  At least serve them with a better knife.    Water glasses were only refilled for some of the people at our table...seemed to be the pretty ones; the banana pudding - while the claim is it is the signature dessert - it was a bit runny and didn't seem to be set long enough.  I was disappointed with the ribs.  The waiter asked my truthful opinion and I told him.  He said it was taken care of and the manager came over and talked to me about it as well.  I appreciate this and the purpose of this restaurant and in order to make things right, the staff needs to know about these flaws.",

The fried chicken plate with collard greens and mac and cheese was the best meal I've had in a while. The greens were perfectly cooked and had a very smokey and sweet flavor that left me wanting more! I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte.  In addition to the great food this restaurant is also a non-profit. All of the profit goes to furthering the restaurants mission \"to raise funds to feed the spiritual and physical needs of those who have the least in our community and to train and equip those previously unemployable in the restaurant trade.\" Amazing food and a MISSION!",

There were 5 of us for a late dinner and desert, King's Kitchen did not disappoint. We started with the cheese plate and fried oysters. The oysters were perfectly cooked and served with a bacon balsamic dipping sauce. I had the shrimp and grits (with the tomato sauce on the side) and it was wonderful. The shrimp were grilled and perfectly spiced and the grits were possibly the best I've ever had. I stole a bite of my friends flank steak and cornbread panzanella while she wasn't looking and it was just as good.   We shared a couple deserts between the 5 of us, we had the pecan pie, coconut chess pie, banana pudding, and the brownie. They were all fantastic.   The service was very good. Our server did a good job of keeping our drinks full making sure we didn't need anything while not interrupting our conversations. That's a fine line to walk with 5 women who don't see each other very often. His knowledge of the menu was helpful when ordering, he knew the menu and dishes inside and out.   My favorite part of the King's Kitchen is that every penny of their profits are donated to help feeding the poor. As if that's not reason enough to give them your business, they also partner with area outreach programs to provide employment to those in need of a new beginning.   Between the delicious food and the knowledge that you're helping those in need, there is no reason to *not* enjoy a meal at The King's Kitchen. Often.",

They are a not-for-profit restaurant that donates 100% of it's profits from sales to feed the community. Not only do they have a noble mission and vision, but they have tasty food!   I had a group interview in Uptown and a few of us were looking for a lunch spot close by. It was the one rainy, cold, windy day that week and we were on foot. Someone suggested Jimmy John's but I refused to walk too far.  Luckily, The King's Kitchen was at the corner of the block. We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints. The other selections at the table looked tasty as well! The prices were fair, $9-13 for the lunch menu.  The service was attentive and everyone was very polite. I would like to return to try their dinner selections.",

    "text": "I give The King's Kitchen a 4 on food and 2 on service for the first visit.  Maybe after the another visit, I'd be willing to bump up my rating.  First off, it's conveniently located downtown, with some nearby street parking or a garage right behind it.  The decor inside is very cute, with some old pots and pans scattered near the front, as well as some interesting home-made art.  I really appreciate their mission of giving the profits to the homeless.    The food was very good.  For the starter, we had the fried oysters, which came with a cocktail sauce and a bacon vinagrette.  They were delicious, and I am not usually a fan of oysters.  I had the fried chicken, with roasted carrots, mashed potatoes, and pan seared cabbage.  The fried chicken was awesome, and all the sides were quite tasty.  The bread they brought to the table had the perfect texture, more crunchy and chewy toward the outside and soft in the middle, with just a hint of sweetness.  They served with real butter, and it was fabulous.  My partner had the fried flounder and mac and cheese - both of these were also great.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  For dessert, we chocolate peanut butter crunch cake.  The cake itself was just ok, but they served it with some really delicious vanilla bean ice cream.  I feel bad complaining about the service, because our server was really nice and it wasn't entirely his fault.  We arrived there for dinner on a Saturday night at 6:00, and we left the restaurant at 7:48.  Our appetizer arrived quickly, but then our food order got lost.  Because our server was so busy, it was almost 7:00 before he realized we had not gotten our food.  He rushed the food, and we got it about 10 minutes later.  He apologized to us then and as we were leaving.  It look another long time before he came over to get our dessert order.  I think they were understaffed, because everybody was really rushing around.  I would definitely come back again, because the food was very good.  I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt about the slow service.  I genuinely feel bad for looking a bit annoyed about our food being lost.  I would watch for slow service if you plan to come here on a busy weekend.",

Our friends had highly recommended it and they did not disappoint.   We sat on the patio, so hopefully our mess wouldn't be too bad. It did get loud with some Friday afternoon traffic and busses, but it wasn't constant. Our waiter was very attentive and sweet to the kids.   My kids split a chicken tender kids meal and they both loved it. I am not a fried chicken fan, but after reading other reviews, I decided to try it, and I am SO GLAD I did! It was very lightly battered and so crispy. The sides were delicious. They were out of green beans, but the mashed potatoes, butter beans, and corn were perfect. My husband and friends had the herb roasted chicken and they thought it was great too. The biscuits were perfect and cornbread was delicious.   My husband had the blueberry cheesecake for dessert and it was gone before I could get a bite! I devoured the banana pudding. The toasted marshmallow on top was the perfect compliment!",

Before food arrived, I decided to wet the palette.. and what do we have here? Oh my, a double IPA! Well thank you very much, I'll have 3.   I went with the fried chicken, mac n cheese, cabbage, buttered beans and a coronary. I ordered the dark meat but got a breast, and so happy I did - it was insanely juicy. The buttered beans almost stole the show, they were so good. The cabbage was greasy but I quickly forgot that as I inhaled the mac n cheese.  The staff was excellent and even gave me a little history of the place, which was pretty touching as the restaurant serves over 60 homeless people every day.

I highly support their mission and the fact that they are not for profit, give jobs to those who might not be able to get employment to past circumstances, and give back to the community in many ways. It is such a great idea and I wish that it would catch on more!  We got deviled eggs to start. They were good deviled eggs! For my entree I got a chicken salad sandwich and a side of mashed sweet potatoes. The food itself was good and I was happy. It wasn't the best I have ever had but it was good. The menu was a little limited and I would like to see it expanded. Maybe there are more dinner options though so can't complain.   The service was excellent and I like the location/feel to the restaurant itself. I suggest stopping by here to support the community and give it a try!",

It was recommended to me by someone in the hotel as a great local place to eat if you like \"Southern food\" He said, you know fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I'm in! That's all I need to hear. I was pleased to hear Christian music playing on the radio and a friendly staff greeting and waiting on me. I ordered the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, butter beans, black eyed peas. Very good and reasonable priced for downtown eating. I also learned more about their mission and how they help people get back on their feet. It's a great place grab a meal when you're in Charlotte.",

Couple that with a few of their sides and someone is going to have to roll you out of the restaurant.  From a sides standpoint, the macaroni and collards are excellent.  They also have a solid pimento cheese dip as an appetizer.  I'm 100% confident that you could wear a blindfold while choosing your dinner and still leave happy.  I love the whole concept of Kings Kitchen.  I'm always a big fan of restaurants giving back to the community in some way shape or form.

We were seated quickly in the bar area and almost immediately had water in front of us (much appreciated after our walk to the restaurant from our hotel).  The host saw that the bartender was preoccupied and he came over to take our dinner order so that we didn't have to wait.  Major bonus points for that awareness.  I ordered the steak frites and my coworker ordered the Salmon served with pimento cheese grits.  I also tacked on a biscuit because. . . why not?  The steak was good.  Not great.  It was cooked to my liking and the demi glace was good but I wish the steak itself had been seasoned more.  The frites were good.  My coworker let me try the pimento cheese grits and those were delicious.  Very rich flavor.  The biscuit was pretty meh.  I expected something to be served with it (butter? jelly?) By itself it was pretty forgettable.    This review is really a 3 star for food and a 4 star for service.  Great service wins out in that battle.",

I had the tri-tip steak with fries and mushrooms, while my wife had the pot roast with mac and cheese and mushrooms. The meals were prepared really well and everything was great tasting.

Our goal was to intake as much southern cuisine as possible, as this was the most \"southern\" state we had been to. With that in mind I ordered the shrimp and grits and my partner ordered the fried chicken. The shrimp were well cooked in a red sauce, but there weren't many and I didn't find the sauce anything extraordinary. I couldn't take the grits. They were just too thick, cheesy, and rich. I love cheese, it's one of my main staples but I couldn't handle these and my partner agreed. I would have much rather had her homemade white wine and garlic shrimp and grits, which are also a while lot healthier than the heart attack on a plate I had. She was also generally unimpressed with her fried chicken which also arrived a little cold. Fried chicken should be piping hot. The service was friendly and the place was very busy so it's clearly well liked, however, I would not go back.",

Ambiance was pleasant. Service was flawless. And, the company was fantastic. Highly recommend this King's Kitchen. Mostly for the good it does in the community. You'll enjoy it.",

The waitstaff are friendly and knowledgeable and the food was excellent. I had the fried flounder with mac n' cheese, collard greens, and butter beans. Each item was tasty - just how you would want it to be, seasoned like it should be. These are some well-known, established type foods, and you have expect it to taste a certain way. And it does, so I was satisfied and happy.  Only downside for me was that it is loud when its full of people, being all glass and chrome, it makes for some noise.",

    "text": "\"Each chicken, feed some people\"- Their slogan on the menu  We loved this place. The fact that their sole purpose is to make good food so that they can feed the homeless in the area makes me happy.   I had the fried chicken with mac & cheese, Black eyed peas and creamy potatoes. The entree was excellent for the most part. The peas were not my favorite, but I think it's more of a preference thing for me. My wife had the fried flounder, and it was amazing. I was actually a little jealous, but don't tell the chicken. We also \"split\" the chocolate, peanut butter crumb cake that was decadent.   The staff were amazing. Some of the best service we have had. Our friend told us that their cornbread was extremely tasty, but when we asked about it, we were informed that they only serve that at lunch now. A few minutes later our waiter came back a warm basket saying he found a few pieces in the back for us. All of his recommendations were spot on and he helped us understand a little more about the mission of the restaurant. Knowing that the proceeds were helping the community, we didn't mind splurging on items that we normally might pass over like dessert.  The atmosphere was also warm and cozy. My wife said it felt like someone's home. The candlelight was perfect and the layout of the place was nice.   Definitely try this place if you are looking for soul food in the Truest meaning of the phrase.",

They all got along swell in my belly.   I had high expectations and they were surely met. Parking wasn't bad, the interior space was very neat, and the waitstaff was very attentive.

    "text": "The Wife and I were heading to a 7:30 show and wanted to give Kings Kitchen a try.  We set a fairly early 6:00 reservation and we were one of the first groups in the restaurant that Monday night.   The server appeared promptly (maybe a little too much so) to take our drink orders, so we put him off just a bit while we perused the wine and beer selections, which were pretty good.  When we placed our dinner orders I let the waiter know that we had a 7:30 show, no big hurry at that time, but better safe than sorry.  I had the Fried Chicken that has gotten so many good reviews, Mac and Cheese, cabbage and mashed potatoes.  My dear Sweet Wife went with the Fried Flounder Filet, Collards, Mac and Cheese and mashed potatoes.  OK, here's where I'm supposed to complain how everything fell apart, we were late for our show, and I died from undercooked chicken.....but none of that happened.  Our meal arrived promptly, but not so fast that we did not have time to enjoy our drinks a little before eating.  The chicken was delicious, juicy and flavorful with a nice crust.  Try as I may, I can't seem to cook chicken, so I appreciate it when someone gets it right.  The cabbage had good flavor, not watery, as you get at many restaurants.  The mac and cheese?  Well, it rivaled my Wife's (sorry Babe), and she makes really good and unhealthy mac and cheese with lots of cheese and cream.  Mashed Potatoes?  Biscuits?  Done right.  The flounder was breaded with the same sort of crust as the chicken instead of a corn meal breading.  She said it was very good.  A big portion of collards were well done.  We passed on dessert because the main portions were plenty.    All in all, we had a good experience.  We had plenty of time, but we weren't rushed by the staff. Of course Monday at 6:00 is not a busy time, but by the time we left several parties had arrived and the place was pretty busy.",

    "text": "King's Kitchen fills many voids in the Charlotte area. First it's a meat & three, which has been long missing since Gus Sir Beef left Latta Arcade years ago.  Second it's a GOOD, upscale meat & three which is part of the Noble family of restaurants (one that even I will enjoy going to). Third it is the most wonderful concept: it is a nonprofit conceived by all proceeds are leveraged to donate to soup kitchens, and other food charities. Beyond that, they employ the otherwise unemployable (formerly incarcerated, rehabilitated, etc.) and are integrating a 40-week job training program to teach life skills. They also hand out box lunches to homeless. There isn't a place like this anywhere around, so I wanted to support this nonprofit even if the food wasn't good. Maybe their motto should be \"Do Good, Eat Well\" because lucky for me, it was delicious.  They said they have the best pan fried chicken in town, so that's what I tried along with some of the best grits I've had in Charlotte (Anson Mill stoneground grits with some corn kernels), stewed squash and fried green beans. The squash was absolutely delicious, and the beans weren't really what I expected- I thought they might be battered and crispy, but they were possibly stewed and then fried so they were definitely more crispy than stewed, but not crispy crispy. My chicken's breast was very tender inside and I would definitely get that again.  I will refrain from commenting on my husband's pot roast since I never like fatty meat. He said it was tender. He accompanied the roast with mac 'n cheese (good but not plentiful enough), collard greens which were tasty and not too vinegary, and creamed corn which weren't too creamy. He was very pleased as well.  Other meats included fried flounder, grilled chicken breasts and Eegads! chicken livers!! We are in the South, Jules, get over it.  There were several other things to choose from as well as some sandwiches.  Desserts included a banana pudding with a torched meringue top from the pastry chef from Johnson & Wales, a brown sugar pound cake, chocolate pie, coconut chess pie and others.    Service was very friendly, but we got the sense some of the staff was underemployable. Since they've been open only a few days they're still in training mode, but was very encouraged about the friendliness.  Right now they are only open for lunch M-F, but they hope to open for breakfast and eventually dinner as well and are going to play with opening for breakfast/lunch on weekends.  Their spot on Church & Trade has a great spot for outdoor seating but I would understand why they would opt to have it be weekdays only.  My office is right next door, so I will definitely be going again. Probably not every week because I would need to change my nickname to Fat Jules, but definitely every other week, perhaps only with a veggie plate!",

The outdoor seating looks great, maybe I'll get to try it next time. The decor was lovely, and reminded me of my great grandmother's summer room. The only issue I had environment-wise was that there were TVs; it seems like too classy a place to have those.  Our server was really friendly and helpful, service was great.  The food was great! The server started us out with a biscuit and piece of cornbread each. The biscuits tasted gorgeous. They were JUST a tad drier than I like though. The cornbread was super moist but was not sweet (yes I want cake at dinner). We both got \"meat and 3\". I got fried chicken, mac & cheese, creamed corn, and mashed potatoes with gravy. Mom got pot roast, mac & cheese, potato salad, and green beans. My chicken was lovely, well cooked and not too dry. I would have liked a little bit of heat (a bit more pepper) before calling it perfect. The mac & cheese was good, it was baked and not the saucy kind (but not the good custard-like stuff you can cut into squares). It was very nice, if a bit oily/greasy. The creamed corn was wonderful. It tasted like it had been on a fresh cob about 30 minutes (I'm guessing at how long it takes to cook it to that nice consistency) before I got it. The mashed potatoes were very nice, although I would have preferred a brown gravy to the cream (I actually ordered them for my mom to eat with her pot roast). The green beans are listed as \"fried\" on the menu, but the server said they're actually stewed (with I think he said bacon, but I'm not sure). The beans needed \"stringing\" but my mom said they were really good. She loved the potato salad and considered trying to order a pint of it to go. I guess the pot roast was ok, I didn't taste it and she didn't say anything about it either way. It definitely looked good.  Sadly we didn't get dessert because we were full. I really want to try some chocolate pie though, yom!  They also have a decent-sized wine list. I don't drink though so I really have no idea if it's good or not. If they add spoon bread they will have a regular customer in my mom; she can't find it anywhere and how can you get more Southern than spoon bread? (The souffle kind, if your chef is reading this, KK! Not corn pudding, although that would be good too.) I'm leaving NC to move to TX so I'm glad I got to visit this restaurant before I left. I wish I could come back soon but that'll have to wait another year...",

The service was fantastic and the food was the absolute best!  I had the fried flounder and my brother had the grilled salmon.  He travels the world and said it was the best salmon he ever had.  Everything tasted fresh and flavored just like a home cooked meal.  I would love to go back and have the shrimp and grits!  If you are looking for a great place to eat, don't skip the King's Kitchen.  It's also a non-profit restaurant that helps feed the hungry...cool!!",

The food is why I had to lower my rating. I went with 3 friends.  I ordered scallops, everyone else ordered the fried chicken, salmon, and pot roast.  First off, our service was SLOOOOW.  Took a long time to order/get our drinks and order food.  Waiter never once checked on us after our meal arrived to find out if everything was ok. He just dropped the check when we were done and then took his sweet time taking care of the bill. When our meals arrived, I was appalled that I only got 3, really small scallops and the tinest scooping of zucchini/tomato ever.  For $22, I expected more. The scallops were well prepared and tasty but about the size of a quarter. The zucchini/tomato mix was severely overcooked mush and I only got one-half of a grape tomato. The corn bread was VERY dry.   Salmon was prepared well, but again a very small portion.  Pot roast was dry and small portions. The only person that enjoyed her meal, and didn't leave hungry was the one that got fried chicken.",

I had the arugula and goat cheese salad, which arrived minus the goat cheese.  Ok, that got fixed.  I ordered the salmon for dinner.  It arrived, a very small piece of fish (~5 ounces?) served in a pool of cream sauce that was devoid of any particular flavor. There were no vegetables, no sides, no nothin.  And 5ounces of fish.  And all for $22.  Sooo not worth it!  And the menu hadn't changed in the year between visits.  The only reason I went for 3'stars is that the server was very good (Dave).  I won't be returning.",

The best part it was a not for profit that went to feed the homeless. After fighting all the road construction we made it there. We had a hard time making a left turn with all the road work. The restaurant was very clean and the personnel were pleasant. My wife had a zucchini appetizer and I had the pot roast dinner. The food was cafeteria quality, edible but nothing to return for. The dinner cost me $45 dollars. They use the restaurant to train people and feed the poor. The 3 stars are strictly for the food.  It's a great venue doing good for the community.",

    "text": "Delicious! Made reservations for 8:30pm through Open Table on a Saturday night. We were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant was a bit slow, but this was the Saturday before Christmas. Most of Charlotte seemed to have left already. The restaurant is casual, open, and spacious.  Our server greeted us shortly after being seated. She was wonderful! She was quick and knowledgeable. My SO and I tried the following: Beet salad - $6 Tomato bisque (cup) - $4 Bread - complimentary Seared scallops - $22 Trout (seasonal special) - $20+ Sticky toffee pudding cake with vanilla bean gelato - $10  The tomato bisque was creamy, but not heavy. The beet salad was refreshing. I was a bit disappointed when my scallop entree arrived. I knocked off a star because the portion was a bit small, especially for the price. It came with 4 small to medium sized scallops and a handful of veggies on the side. Regardless, they were absolutely delicious! I was scraping my plate in less than five minutes. I was still hungry. My SO could tell and tried to offer me more of his dish. The trout entree on the other hand, was significantly bigger than mine. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and full of flavor on the inside. For the dessert, the sticky toffee pudding is to die for!!! It was heaven in my mouth. My SO saw my face light up after the first couple of bites and decided to let me finish the rest of the dessert. I could have easily eaten five of those! After the dessert, I was finally full.  We appreciate the message and mission of the restaurant. We cannot wait to return!",

I didn't ask, but it appears that there are no soft drinks, and I didn't see anyone drinking tea, just water (which is what we had) and beer/wine.   We got the Sweet Potato fritters with sorghum butter to start and it was impressive. Great fry on the fritters and a sweet, rich flavoring on the butter.  My entree was full of flavor but had many technical errors. I got the Fried Chicken platter with Mac & Cheese, Sauteed Mushrooms, and Green Beans. Chicken was just slightly overcooked with dry meat, I did choose the white meat instead of the dark, which probably would have been more forgiving moisture-wise, but I expected a finer attention to detail from a restaurant specializing in southern cooking. Mushrooms were very flavorful but perhaps placed in a very cold bowl because they were lukewarm while the rest of my food was hot. Green beans were full of flavor, perfectly seasoned, but very stringy. My girlfriends shrimp and grits were outstanding, I kinda wish I had gotten the same thing!   Had I gotten this meal anywhere else it probably would have been close to a 4 star review, but as a self-proclaimed Southern Kitchen, I expected these fundamental dishes to be perfect, especially 1 block away from Trade & Tryon. I'll be back and at least I know what to look for on the next visit.  As a non-profit, they have a noble cause, which you can read more of on other reviews!",

My colleague gave me a few options, including The King's Kitchen. She explained to me that the concept of this restaurant is upscale southern home cookin' with a twist-most of the staff are looking to get out of rough situations or improve their skill set so they are more marketable in the workforce. I was sold on the idea!  The service was friendly, although I could tell it was a little out of the comfort zone of our server. But I give him 5 stars for effort and dedication! Keep it up, my friend.  As for the food-I got the pot roast and it was amazing! The entire experience was great and I'd love the change to support them again if I find myself in Charlotte.",

It's been awhile since I've been here, and never at lunch always at dinner time but the King's Kitchen did not disappoint. While my friend enjoyed the kale salad, I dove headfirst into the NC catfish platter, with sides of collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and cream corn, and oh yes cornbread.   The catfish was scrumptious, lightly breaded and fried just right, simply delightful and went down very quickly. The Mac and cheese were nearly homemade and the collard greens for out of this world. In addition to the mission of King's Kitchen, being a not-for-profit run restaurant that does great work in the community, they also do a great service to the stomach. Service here was excellence, The Waitresses extraordinarily attentive and we had our food in record time.  King's Kitchen is a must-stop when uptown Charlotte.",

Long story short, they are a non-profit business that provides job training, meals, and a church service to the homeless and those in need. I'm not a super religious person, but helping people in need is so amazing, you can't help but support it. There are religious references throughout the restaurant, so if that bothers you, you've been given a heads up.  You need to make a reservation if you plan on going on the weekend. Hubs and I went on a Friday night, and waited about 20 minutes to sit at the bar which we didn't mind. We both got a glass of riesling which was delicious and reasonably priced. The menu is good, ol' southern comfort food, so we ordered the fried chicken plate. It comes with 3 sides of your choice for about $15 which is very reasonable. There are nicer, but more expensive items on the menu. The food was absolutely delicious. Hubs is typically a picky eater and he loved everything.  The atmosphere is romantic and comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. There is no private parking since it's in uptown, but there are garages and street parking nearby. We will definitely return in the future!",

Fried chicken was dry and all my sides were lukewarm. However the catfish and fries were hot and tasty. The Mac and Cheese was stellar and the collards were seasoned just right (tang and sweet). I was most impressed with the customer service. Hostess greeted and seated us immediately. The manager checked on our table during the meal and when I gave feedback on the meal he was genuine and appreciative. Even our server was attentive and thoughtful, apologizing when he forgot to bring a condiment. Overall I would return the dining experience alone made quite an impression.  TIP: Choose biscuits over cornbread!",

    "text": "I was staying at the Holiday Inn a few blocks from here and I was recommended The King's Kitchen by the front desk staff. I got in at about 8pm on a Saturday night and was looking for my first taste of southern food. The King's Kitchen was the perfect choice for the evening. It was a quick walk from my hotel and I was seated immediately at the bar for a late dinner.   To start off I ordered Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout, I loved it, it's a full bodied stout brewed with milk sugar... great local beer. For dinner I opted for Aunt Beaut's Pan Fried Chicken dark meat, which came with a biscuit and a choice of 3 sides so I went with collard greens, mac and cheese, green beans. The fried chicken was great - crispy and savory skin and super tender dark meat. All the sides were great as well - collard greens were bomb, mac and cheese was super creamy, and the green beans had a nice flavor to them as well. The buttery biscuit was good too but I was too stuffed from all the other goodies to finish it.   Not only was the food and drinks delicious, the mission behind The King's Kitchen is just the cherry on top. It's a not for profit establishment that donates 100% of it's profits to feed the poor in Charlotte. The staff are Charlotte residents that have suffered from life-challenges such as poverty, homelessness, or incarceration. Loved everything about this place, I would highly recommend it if you're ever in Uptown Charlotte.",

    "text": "I have to say I was less than impressed after reading some great reviews and coming in with high hopes for King's Kitchen. Every time I'd be in town, I'd miss their open hours since they close early, but I got lucky this particular Thursday where they were open a little later than during the rest of the week. The venue is nice and open with a small private party room off to the left and friendly staff to greet you. It does offer a nice open bar area with open seating and table service, depending on which one would prefer. But the important part of the whole experience comes down to the food. I started off with the bartender recommended fried oysters. They were a bit dry and inconsistent, however the achilles heel was all the shell fragments that were fried with the oyster. Either they weren't shucked properly or just a matter of bad hands going from shell to batter to oil. I fought through 2 of those before I pushed that away. Moved on to the dinner portion and asked between the fried chicken and the salmon. I was recommended the salmon and again, maybe it was just the recommendation that did me wrong? The salmon had a funny texture to it, meaning it was likely frozen and quick thawed before being cooked. It did have a good flavor but the texture was definitely off. What made the dish bad was that it was served on what I would call a bed of shoe-string fries. With salmon, I was hoping for a nice steamed vegetable or greens of some sort to cut what is typically a fatty fish, but very odd combination. I did opt for dessert which was the banana cream and that was pretty awesome served in a mason jar that gives the idea to make it at home and create a dangerous portable snack. Overall, maybe my menu selections were bad and this was an off night, but considering the other numerous options around downtown I'd pass on this one.",

I didn't learn until after I had eaten here that this was a non-profit organization, which is cause enough for me to return. The food was really delicious. The sweet potato fritters with honey were a nice twist from a usual appetizer. I couldn't even take a picture of my entree because just as soon as it arrived I started to indulge. I ordered the pot roast which was very juicy and tender (recommended) and my friend ordered the pork chop which was decent. The mashed potatoes are a great side, especially if you get the pot roast. The roast juices mixed with the potatoes are a divine combination.",

Nothing amazing, but it did have a nice thin crust that was not over powering.  I was almost out the door for $20 when the desert special of fresh bread pudding caught my eye.  They say it takes 20 minutes and it was a good 20-30 min, so if you are interested either order it early or be prepared to wait.  It was incredibly rich and fresh, no complaints.

The concept is so wonderful, and such a blessing to see that \"unemployable\" people are trained and given the opportunity to work well with the public.  Grilled Meatloaf was top notch and the sides were all so good and properly prepared.  Local stout on draft tied the entire meal together.  Bravo, and God Bless this place!",

The waiter seemed really busy.  He took our order and I tried to order an appetizer, but took off before I could ask.  I've never been here before, so maybe this is the normal wait time? Who knows...  The waiter is nice and the Arnold Palmer is delicious so far.  Oh and the water here, superb!  Maybe I'll revise this later when I see/taste/smell the food.  If I don't revise, that means I walked out.  I don't have time to wait much longer for food.",

    "text": "I would describe this as upscale southern and dangerously good! We had dinner here last Friday and had a great time. The food and service was great and we chatted with our neighboring table that happened to be a family that moved from California to NC.   I ordered the fried chicken ($14) and it came with three sides, so I went with the mac and cheese, collard greens, and green beans. Even though I know how collard greens are prepared, I was trying to trick my body into thinking that I was eating semi-healthy by ordering some veggies. lol. The fried chicken did not disappoint and the collard greens were the best that I've ever had (second only to the homemade greens made by my friend, Earl). I'm pretty sure it was cooked with the most flavorful bacon fat! :p   My bf ordered the fried flounder ($17) and he chose mac and cheese, creamed potatoes and gravy, and creamed corn. The flounder was good but I was going bananas over the potatoes and corn! Take a scoop of the potatoes and a little of the corn on your fork and YUM! Heavenly! Speaking of bananas, we decided to have the banana pudding ($5) for dessert. It came in a drinking glass and was topped with toasted marshmallow. We usually share a dessert but I think next time I want my own. lol! It was so good! It was nicely chilled and super creamy but with a few chunks of banana and hints of vanilla. I think it had some graham cracker crumbs or cookie crumbs for texture as well. Whatever it was, it added to the loveliness of this dish.  And then there's the concept that I absolutely love. It is a not-for-profit restaurant that gives back by feeding the hungry and helping people get back/stay on their feet. I talked to Jake (our waiter who was excellent!) about the mission of the restaurant before we left and he also gave me a piece of paper that explained everything. I'll be in town for a couple more months and I will gladly spend my money at KK, not just for the excellent food, but to contribute to a wonderful cause.   Photos taken: meals noted in review plus banana pudding and view from the street.",

At the recommendation of my waiter, I had flounder, mac n cheese, corn, and greens........not bad, not bad at all. They also serve cornbread while you wait, but be warned if you're used to your cornbread being sweet, you may want to pass but it wasn't that bad. The flounder was very crisp and light served with some of the best tarter I think I've ever had. The corn was absolutely delish.....I mean my meal could have been a plate of corn and I would have been just fine! I'm not sure why they call it creamed corn, because what I had was definitely fried corn where I'm from. The collards were very tender, but had vinegar in the mix, which I am not a fan so I'll leave it at that. I wasn't expecting the mac n cheese to pass my taste test but to my surprise it was a winner. Very good meal overall......4 stars.",

The Bad: I'm not sure if we were there on an off night or what (quite possible when looking at photos from other reviewers) - but the food just wasn't good.  Given the reviews - we were very surprised.  We started with cornbread and biscuits for the table - they had little flavor and were so heavy and greasy that when we ordered our meal we said no thanks to the bread option.  I ordered fried chicken w/ mac&chs, butter beans & collards.  The greens were good - but that was pretty much it.  The chicken was dry, the mac&cheese had the same old-oil taste the bread had and the butter beans were okay for being out of a can, but nothing special.  A friend order a Salmon special and she said that was good so I wish I had ordered that instead.    The Good:  Service was good.  Attentive and friendly server took care of us.  The premise behind the restaurant is fabulous - giving back to the community.  But I would have rather given my $$ directly to their cause than spent it on the food.",

We must say that the food was excellent and beyond our expectations, mainly because the southern cuisine taste and style of cooking was prevalent in all dishes which we were seeking coming from ny as tourists. The fried chicken, mac cheese, potato gravy, and steak were all very well made and all in southern style of cooking. The portions are not too small or big but I would stay away from appetizers if you get heavier entrees like chicken or steak. The restaurant gets packed fast so you can either go early like we did at 6pm for dinner or make reservations. Clean, tasty food at good ambience restaurant.

So, I'm very happy to see that the King's Kitchen has been going strong for over a year.  The food and service here are very good. I typically opt for the veggie plate (delicious mac and cheese and greens), but I'm also a fan of the white-meat fried chicken, and I have a friend who swears by the pot roast. The deserts are definitely a weak spot--the banana pudding tastes instant and the chess pie wasn't very good either.  But you go here for the entrees, not the deserts, so that's forgivable.  As many have noted, the restaurant has a positive social message, which makes it easier to tolerate the high prices for what is, in essence, extremely cheap Southern soul food (I grew up on these delicious artery-clogging recipes, so I feel that I can say this with some authority).  This type of food is neither difficult nor expensive to make. But, since I'm not making it at home and this place does a good job of it, I'll have to put myself down as a fan.  I would recommend going here for lunch rather than dinner because the lunch prices are cheaper and the portion-sizes for both meals seem to be about the same.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place a better rating, I really did.  The food at King's Kitchen is amazing (though a tiny bit pricey) and the restaurant seems to have a really great purpose.  However, after the treatment we got on our anniversary I doubt I'd ever go back.  My husband and I went to the restaurant to celebrate eleven years of marriage.  We were expecting a special event, especially after reading all the glowing reviews.  What we got was a waitress who treated us like dirt, while treating her only other table at the time like old friends.    We sat at our table, and when we saw a woman roll her eyes as she stared our way I whispered to my husband \"Oh man.  I hope she's not our waitress.  She looks like she hates us already!\"  Lucky us, here she came.  She said nothing about specials, gave us no suggestions, had to come back to hear our drink orders TWICE, and all we ordered was tea.  And ten minutes later, when a couple of women sat in her section across from us, we got the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies, telling them in detail the specials and what came with them, which dishes were good and even telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was SOLD OUT.  What?  And while our appetizer sat on the counter where we could see it, she held a ten-minute conversation with these ladies about the conference they were attending and oh my gosh, we're all from the same hometown?  What a coincidence!  Let's talk some more!  After that the loud PLUNK as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the restaurant.  Before we could even request a refill on our tea, she was gone, back to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interrupted.  We didn't get our food for forty minutes, during which time we got to watch our neighbors, who arrived fifteen minutes after us, dig into two plates of delicious-looking food.  By the time we got our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the restaurant for an hour and twenty minutes and we were actually feeling like nuisances.  We honestly should have complained to a manager, but we had to get to our other anniversary plans.  If I had it to do all over again I would have said something.  As it is they've lost us as customers.  If I'm going to pay that much for dinner, I'd like to be treated like a human being at least.    The funny thing is the ladies and that waitress had more than their hometown in common, and though I'd hate to think prejudice came into play, it seems to be a very plausible possibility.  I just don't know why a woman who is so friendly to other people could look at us and decide we were worthless scum without knowing us.  But that's what happened.  The difference in the way they were treated and the way we were treated was astoundingly obvious.",

Proceeds go towards the local homeless population and there's some job training aspects.  Very neat idea and cause!  Was a bit empty at dinner (like most of downtown Charlotte) but couldn't get a table at lunch the one day I tried.  Leave your expectations at the door and just enjoy a well cooked meal and a well thought out cause & mission.",

    "text": "Today for lunch I had the pleasure of re-visiting The Kings Kitchen and I have to admit that their service has improved dramatically. When I arrived the staff here really rolled out the red carpet! I was warmly greeted and seated quickly. I started off with the sweet potato fritters which were quite amazing they came out with a side of honey they were the perfect appetizer . For my entree I ordered the catfish that came with three sides. I've never had catfish before and didn't know what to expect but when it came out I was in heaven ! The catfish was fried perfectly it was light and crisp but not greasy and flavorful for my sides I choose the Mac and cheese, seared cabbage and the butter beans that came a side corn bread and a biscuit everything thing hands down was good. When you come here for lunch come with an appetite . Now last but not least one thing makes this place special from any other place . This restaurant is a non profit that donates all of its proceeds and opens it's doors in the afternoon to feed the less fortunate in Charlotte! I had the pleasure of witnessing this first hand and it was beautiful to see the non profit in action. So if your looking for a great meal please support this place. Not only is the food fantastic but your contributing to a great cause. Eating out never tasted so good :)",

    "text": "Well, I guess that satisfaction is a derivative of expectations versus outcomes and based on the very high reviews of King's Kitchen, my expectations were equally high.    Granted, the concept of this restaurant is wonderful - all profits go to help the homeless population and job sharing programs with the homeless help them establish greater self-confidence and good job skills to help them get back on their feet.  What I wondered, however, was whether the mission swayed the reviews some.    Based on this being a non-profit, I assumed that this would be a hole-in-the wall location with a modest environment.  However, the setting was a little bright and loud.  The first thing I noticed was that my bread plate was dirty, as was the one at the neighboring table where I was borrowing a replacement.  The biscuits they brought for the plates were good and warm, but not the best I have had.  Our server was very friendly and explained the concept and the chariable mission, which was nice background to have.  Unfortunately, that is where the positives ended.    My girlfriend had a stuffed pork loin at the recommendation of the waiter and I had the blackened catfish over cheese grits.  The pork loin was extremely dry and over-cooked and the additional sauce we requested to try to make it more edible didn't help much.    The blackened catfish was decent, but half of it was beyond blackened and I had to cut off a decent chunk of the fish that looked like charcoal.  The grits were good, but its pretty hard to mess those up.  I'm disappointed that I didn't like this place better.  I really wanted it to be good and have a new place to which I could return.  Its a great cause, but at the end of the day, the food has to be what brings me back.  I'm glad to see others had better luck than we did.  Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things.  Sounds like the fried chicken is the way to go!",

    "text": "Deviled eggs, braised pork belly, skillet fried chicken, mac & cheese, coconut pie... have I died and gone to heaven?!?  I got a LivingSocial coupon the other day, and I think this is the fastest I have ever used my coupon.  I have been wanting to try this place, and there's no better way than to drag my girl friend with me on a random Tuesday night armed with an empty stomach and gift certificate!  The interior hasn't changed much since it was ARPA (and on that note, I miss ARPA and their sangria by the pitcher).  We got a table quickly.  Our server greeted us and informed me (since I'm the newbie) that this is a non-profit establishment.  I think it's a very great concept and admirable thing to do (bravo to Chef Noble).    We decided to split our \"loots\" since it was getting late and she wasn't too hungry.  Somehow we still managed to polish 2 appetizers, 1 meat and three and a dessert (as you can guess, it was mostly my doing... taking a bow here).  Deviled eggs was tasty, the filling was a little more liquid than I am used to, but it was still good.  Braised pork belly was fabulous; perfect balance of fat and meat... I think it was served on a bed of sauerkraut, which was a bit too salty.  Skillet fried chicken was crispy.  The breading didn't take away from the meat.  The 3 sides we picked were mac & cheese (fabulous, moist, just enough cheese sauce), pan seared cabbage (looked undercooked but wasn't, it was amazingly flavorful), and butter beans (another good one, I'm sure there's bacon in it, just have to!)  We closed out the night with a slice of Coconut Chess Pie, which was topped with a fluffy (big) dash of whipped cream.  The pie was a little hard (both the crust and the filling) but I love coconut, and it tasted good... not too sweet.  I think the most disappointing part of the meal was the butter that was brought out with the cornbread... it was bland... but I am picky about my butter.    It was a great night of good food and good cause.  I will definitely be back, I have my eyes on the Polenta Bites and Fried Pork Chop :)",

Now for the food... I ordered the gumbo [over spiced and tiny] and the fried chicken with mac&cheese and sauteed mushrooms... the fried chicken was really dry and the meat itself had no flavor it was all in the skin.. which was still lacking. The mushrooms weren't even really cooked.. it just tasted like raw mushroom drowned in veggie oil. The cornbread was dry as well [woohoo..] the only decent thing I had was the mac&cheese.. but yeah.. no drink refills.. slow service.. meh food.. 1 star",

Everyone is super nice and helpful, you can tell the staff really like their jobs and want people to feel at home.    The decor is perfection for me, really chic bar and white linen table cloths.  I cant wait for summer to eat on the pretty corner patio!  Obviously the restaurant is for a good cause so it is catty to say something may be overpriced on the menu....but it was.  The $13 cheese plate came with tiny tiny bits of six different kinds of cheeses (that were ok) and a few crackers and two tiny globs of honey.  This should have been about $6 bucks....that really is the only critisism I have of this place.    I got the Meat and Three (butter beans, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  Yes the mac and cheese at Macs is better but it was just fine here.  The chicken was the 'Meat'  and it was perfectly done fried chicken (yes better than Prices!)  Everything else was fantastic!!!  My friend got the Meat and Three also (fried flounder, collards, cabbage and green beans).  His green beans you thought may be boring??? OH NO!!!  They were spicy and delish - maybe a white pepper on these or something?  I couldnt place it...but all awesome and worth every penny.  Great wine list and very attentive service.  With wine and the app and the meals and to-die-for Pound Cake for dessert we were out of there for $80.  Cant wait to come back!!!  :-D",

I went with the meat and 3 and did the fried chicken with mac & cheese, creamed corn and sweet potatos.  It was all good but not great.  I prefer the style of the sides at Rooster's and the creamed corn wasn't really creamed.  The corn bread was awesome though.  I did have to ask about them because our server never brought them over till long after our food arrived.  My aunt did get a run down of the restaurants mission statement from our server and overall they seemed to really enjoy themselves.

    "text": "Mmmm... Southern comfort food served up under the watchful eye of restauranteur Jim Noble and located right in the heart of uptown.  Additionally, the restaurant is a non-profit where 100% of profits goes to feed the local needy and servers are folks identified by other ministries as looking for a new beginning.  What's not to love here?    Jim Noble has labeled his cuisine \"new local Southern\"  and it shows here, where the menu revolves around a selection of the classic \"meat and three,\" though you can also have a sandwich or salad as well.  Chicken, both friend and barbecued, is featured prominently along with staples like meatloaf and friend flounder.  The real gems here are the selection of vegetables available to you- I am particularly found of the smashed sweet potatoes, wilted spinach, and red sea island peas.  And you know they have pepper vinegar or texas pete to throw some heat on these!  Vegetarians rejoice- you can have a veggie plate of 4 selections for $10 (my usual go-to).  The tomato soup is pretty darn good here too.  And don't miss the biscuits here folks- I've had my share of dry, large biscuits, but these are almost creamy in the middle- like soft pillows just waiting to be ripped apart.  Holy goodness!  They make a cake-like cornbread too, but it's a red-headed step child to the biscuits.  Servers are dressed in jeans and white dress shirts.  All I have encountered have been nothing but professional and accommodating.  They all have their favorites on the menu too- if you can't decide just ask.  The dining room is a comfortable mix of tables and some booth seating.  The colors are warm and neutral- furthering the \"Southern comfort\" ambiance.  Large plasma TVs on the wall generally play sports on mute, nice for those at the bar seats, but a little disjointed for the main dining room.  If you do venture here for lunch, note that things are usually fine before noon and after about 1 PM.  The noon hour is a zoo with a line usually out the door.  The hostess will get to you in order, but the wait can be a little unpredictable.  This is just proof others think what we've been writing here, King's Kitchen is good food for a good cause.  A rare win-win for all involved.  Bravo!",

The serious standouts of the meal were the fried zucchini (batter was reminiscent of a tempura), the not sweet but so buttery and good cornbread, and the comparable biscuits. My pan fried chicken was quite tasty, although I personally prefer my fried chicken deep fried. My friend raved about the tender goodness of his oxtail. We all did go for meat+3 BUT I noted that they also offer \"big plates\", I suppose to appease those people who look down on meat + 3 out of principle. They read more like entrees so I suppose thats what they are. Anyway.  Even though the place is basically a charity, it ain't charitable to eat here.  It's well-deserved.  Darn good cookin'.",

I have been in the hospital and could not help but think about my graduation dinner I had there with my family who came into town. This was an important part of my life for me. The food was not all what I expected. The wait time was horrible. Especially when everyone else had gotten their meals except for my brother n law. I felt he was made to wait longer due to the fact of him being the only white person at the table. He ordered the quickest thing that could be prepared salmon. Why did it take salmon 30 minutes to come out after our meal? I feel that sometimes situations such as this happens on purpose due to the fact that interracial couples are not welcomed.",

I got the fried chicken with sides of Mac and cheese, green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy. My dinner date got the duck breast with roasted sweet potatoes, candied pecans and sliced apples. Everything was SO Flavorful and fresh. We learned that all their ingredients are from local farmers and local businesses which we thought it was really cool! For desert, we got the coconut cake --- ITS A MUST TRY! Our waiter was so awesome! He was so professional and did not rush us at all. If you are looking for a nice place for southern food, this is it! Highly recommended.",

I was in Charlotte on business and we liked this place so much, we had to come back again.  The cheese plate is excellent, with some really great local cheeses.  Both times I had the scallops because they were so damn good, but the seven other people said all the dishes they had were fantastic too.  The dessert was amazing - that freshly made bread pudding and the chocolate mousse really stood out.  Prices are very reasonable as well.  Appetizers between $5-10, entrees between $15-25, and desserts around $8-10.  For the quality, you'd be hard pressed to find a better more reasonable meal that tastes this good.  All in all, one of the best dining experiences I've had.  If you're in town, you've got to try this place.  If you live there, The King's Kitchen should already be your go to spot.",

I contemplated trying it for 2 days before a co-worker looking to grab dinner convinced me to test it out. I'm very glad she did.  Naturally like others - I love the concept. I've come across it several times now in my travels, but this is the first time I decided to eat at such a restaurant. You get them feel goods when you do.   I ordered a scallop special and my co-worker had a duck special. Both were fantastic! Or so she told me on the duck because of course I didn't sample hers. I am not the biggest scallop fan, though I keep ordering it because I WANT to like them. These were the best scallops I have ever had. EVER. The succotash paired very well with the seafood as did the apple sauce tasting ... sauce atop them. Beautifully plated and amazingly delicious.  Admittedly, the service was slow. Very slow. But the food and fantastic weather (we sat outside) push me to give this restaurant five stars. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone I know visiting Charlotte.",

I went for lunch with my family and were not disappointed. I ordered the chicken sandwich with a house salad, the sandwich was fried and seasoned perfectly topped with homemade pickles, slaw, and a special sauce. My family got the fried chicken with sweet potato mash, collards, and green beans. The fried catfish that my sister got was delicious it was so flaky and flavorful. Everything we received was amazing. We decided to try the banana pudding for dessert and though presented pretty that was the only disappointment we had. The pudding consistence was grainy and creamy, I wouldn't recommend it.  Definitely want to try their bread pudding though next time, but they only serve it during dinner.  Tip: If you come for lunch make sure you don't go an hour or two before they close because after a certain time they run out of chicken during the lunch rush.",

Normally, when you add a piece of chicken or fish to an entree salad, it will cost an extra $5 or so.  Well, I was shocked when I got the bill.  The salad was $12 and the small piece of salmon was $14.  That means I had a $26 salad.  NOT RIGHT!  I confirmed with the server that the bill was correct and he said it was.  As fabulous as this salad was, every single bite, the salmon upcharge left a bad taste in my mouth!  Otherwise, I love the mission of this restaurant and the fact that it is a non profit. They are doing some good things in the city.  The uptown atmosphere was fun, though the restaurant was a bit noisy for a conversation.  When I left, I purchased a bracelet at the register.  The proceeds will go to a person in need who strung the beads.  It's s fun little ditty for my wrist. All in all, it was a good experience.  I just didn't count on a lunch that was almost $40.",

This is a non-profit restaurant whose proceeds go to feeding the less fortunate. Amazing! They also work with the Charlotte Mecklenburg Dream Center, and host bible studies during the week. What an incredible place!!   Now for the food! I ordered the famous fried chicken with mac and cheese, creamy potatoes, creamed corn, and cornbread. DELICIOUS!! The chicken was fried to perfection, but a little dry (no worries though). I loved the mac and cheese, potatoes, and cornbread (so yummy)! The creamed corn was good, but not my favorite. I really wanted to try the banana pudding, but I was so full from dinner. That gives me an excuse to go back!",

We knew time was of the essence and wasted no time in putting in drink and food orders. The food was great. We both had the steak and frites. Our options were limited because the kitchen had run out of a few things. (Again we showed up one hour before closing, so not their fault) the service was top notch, the food was great, and the benefit to the community is priceless. I would highly recommend this place, and if you want to get your hands on the best dishes, show up a bit earlier than we did. Cheers!",

Fresh, well executed, and very tasty. But moreover, the restaurant is entirely non-profit, with all profits being donated. The restaurant is also staffed by employees who have all been given a second chance in life.  Now as for the food, my coworkers and I tried almost all of their appetizers, with the sweet potato bread and jalapeno hush puppies being our favorite.  For an entree, I had the shrimp and grits, and can definitely see why they're known for this dish. Get it! Don't think about it. Just get it!  As for dessert, I had the sweet toffee cake with gelato. It was a great way to end the meal. Not too sweet,the ice cream was all melt, and when the melted ice cream mixed with the toffee, heaven!!",

The prices were on the high end but it is a nonprofit and has nothing to do with my three stars.  The salmon was cooked well but had way too much soy sauce which overpowered everything in the dish. Every bite tasted like I was taking a shot of soy sauce. Also, the service was not good in my opinion. Our server seamed annoyed to be there.  I do hope to make it back to kings kitchen soon and have a better experience.",

When you walk in, there are news articles and things for you to read and get a better understanding of this establishment. They offer bible study, job training, and help feed/employ the homeless, among other things. (That alone will bring me back)  Our waiter was super nice. I ended up ordering the fried chicken. I have NOT had fried chicken that delicious since my great grandmother was alive(God Rest her sweet soul). It was fried to perfection. The Mac and cheese was delicious. The greens were ok though. Not amazing but not terrible. I probably wouldn't get them again. I'm usually not a heavy eater and almost always take more than 1/2 my food home. My plate was CLEAN when I was done. No leftovers whatsoever.   The next time I'm in Charlotte, I will most definitely come back!",

The menu was VERY limited and because of this we chose to tip the waiter and count our losses. We were eating with another couple and children were in our party as well. We are primarily poultry eaters and the chicken dishes were pretty much fried. No one wanted seafood so it went downhill quickly. We decided to eat at another spot but if in Downtown Charlotte again I would definitely like to give it another try.   Con- I accidentally knocked my water off the table while waiting for my husband to park and join us. Our waiter oddly enough gave me a kid cup with a lid like the rest of the children at the table.

When I walked in I was greeted and seated fairly quickly maybe because it was a table for one. I already knew what I wanted.. Salmon with beet risotto w/ kale.  My drink came and then a couple minutes later my food was ready. I was surprised how quickly they prepared knowing risotto might take a little longer.  I first tried the salmon and it was delicious. But as soon as I tried the risotto I knew why my food came out too quick for a reason. The rice/risotto was hard. I've had risotto in many places and I also cook it at home and it wasn't this hard. I understand al dente but it didn't  even seem as my rice was cooked. I complained about it and they made me a new one, unfortunately, the risotto was hard again. I guess the chef didn't taste the remake of the risotto before serving it again. Just by looking at the rice it didn't even look cooked or al dente. I didn't even bother of complaining again. I just ate the hard rice. I didn't eat anything all day so either complain again and be brought the same tough risotto or just eat it since my salmon was already cold. I decided to just eat, pay, and leave! I don't know if this is how risotto is really prepared at the kings kitchen or this is how north carolinas like their risotto. But I've tried risotto at different restaurants in different states and the risotto here is not part of the norm. It stands out but not for the right reasons.",

I had the skillet fried chicken with mac and cheese, pan-seared cabbage, and creamed corn.  The chicken was fabulous, moist with a delicious crust to it.  The creamed corn was really good.  Fresh corn with just the right hint of seasonings.  Mac and cheese was just like Mom's so it was delish.  Husband had the steak special with au gratin potatoes and some wilted spinach.  The steak was on the smaller side but the flavor was terrific.  I really like the potatoes.  They were well cooked.    For dessert, we had the brown sugar pound cake and the bananna pudding.  Both were really great.    Friday nights is live jazz night.  The musicians were great, but it was a bit loud for conversation in the small space.

Fried chicken melts in your mouth; cornbread delicious; pot roast yummy; 3 sides included; banana pudding WTC (worth the calories!). )Everybody  is professional and super-friendly. Service is terrific. Reasonable prices too. Best meal we've had in Charlotte and we've been to Mimosa Grill and Luce. Paid more than double what King's Kitchen costs too. The icing on the pecan pie....humanity benefits from this not-for-profit restaurant also!!",

I really wish we had room for desert afterward because there were a few options which I'm sure would be great. On top of it all, it's in a good location. A block from the action, it's along Church Street where I usually can find a parking spot. We will be back for breakfast for those biscuits.",

    "text": "I eat here quarterly. It's about every time I need a hair cut I always find myself going next door to King's because I know I'll get something qualitatively good.   Much if not all of The King's Kitchen menu is farm-to-table and that will always have a sweet spot in a slow foodies heart. While I haven't toured their menu extensively I do fall into some easy categories.  Instead of need a V8, I often need a Veggie plate. Collards are smokey-bacony, mac and cheese is buttery delicious, corn casserole or creamed corn is--well creamy nomnom. I sometimes range on my veggies--carrots are in sometimes, green beans others, or a dish of fresh beets are yummy too.  Grilled meat loaf. Sometimes you just need a weight in your belly, a good anchor point is a slab of meatloaf grilled a bit with a side of smokey sauce and some veggies to go with it. Haven't gone wrong with that yet.  Specialty sandwich of the day--this ranges all over the board. Yesterday was a Virginia fried oyster sandwich, tega kay lettuce, aioli which was--dayum good.  To add to it--they added a pastry case in the front sometime in the last year and even though I'm surrounded by desserts 24x7 I really enjoy some of the treats they cook up. The coconut brownie is a heart attack and perfect for a partial late night snack.  To balance out all this goodness their pricing is on the high side, which is to be expected for something local and scratch made. Sides for sandwiches are extra, don't let this throw you or it will. Portion size are just a tad small for sides but it's good to moderate. So these mild detractors are just cosmetic. They don't interfere with the quality of the meal to be had. :D",

Atmosphere was great. Packed, but got seated quickly. Service was very friendly and suggested a couple specials. I had the pork chop dinner....it was incredible. The chop was so juicy. The polenta was great, and the glaze sealed the deal. Top 3 best meals of all time!! Im serious.   The $9 house salad was disappointing (bland, no salt n pepper or flavor) with a ranch dressing that didnt come close to the flavor of ranch, more like a creamy herb I couldnt identify.  But I tell you, the pork chop meal completely made up for it.   My colleagues got the gumbo and said it was really good, as well as the fried chicken. I very well may go there again tomorrow because it was that good!!",

Hot Pimento Dip:  Probably the highlight of the meal.   Sweet Potato Fritters:  Awful.  All you could taste was clove(?).    The server was sweet, but seemed out of it.    Last but not least, the printed beer menu was ~80% wrong.  Instead of just telling us what was on tap, the server simply responded \"sorry, we don't have that\" to nearly every beer on the menu.

We started our meal with the sweet potato fritters with honey and I was blown away. They could have easily been served for dessert and were out of this world delicious. I would have been a lot happier if i just got these and then dessert. This 3 star review would have at least been 4 stars.   For dinner i was starving so i got the King's Kitchen Burger with a side of Mac and Cheese. I wasn't asked what temp i wanted my burger at so i made sure to clarify that i wanted it medium rare, it was definitely more medium/medium well. My mac and cheese was good, but wasn't outstanding. Overall the dinner portion was mediocre at best. My one friend got the gumbo, which she seemed fairly happy with, and the corn bread. The corn bread was dry dry dry. It was definitely not what she wanted. My other friend got the tomato soup and was happy with it. She got a biscuit on the side and loved being able to dip it in the soup.  For dessert we decided to split the banana pudding with a marshmallow on top. We told our waiter that we were going to split it and she kindly had them split it in the kitchen so we each got our own marshmallow. The banana pudding was delicious. If i come back to the King's Kitchen i am going for the sweet potato fritters and the dessert. Everything else was not worth it.",

We're from a small town in Georgia and we live for soul food, we know the ins and outs of the kitchen and how REAL southern food is supposed to taste. And THIS AINT IT. The collard greens taste like the were drowned in sugar, tougher than jerky, and had an after taste we can't explain. The chicken wasn't southern fried at all and wasn't crispy. The Mac n Cheese had clumps of cheese in it and the noodles weren't covered in cheese like baked Mac n cheese should be. My friend ordered the duck.... it wasn't tender, hard to cut and still had blood in it. She asked the waitress to make sure it was cooked all the the way through and the waitress stated she would just put it in as medium so it won't be dry.   All I can say is that my steak was cooked medium rare like I requested and my tea was sweet like I like it. I don't know why or who is rating this place 5 stars but please stop the madness. I am a southern girl who's had southern food all my life, my mom and I should have went in the kitchen and cooked our own food. It was disgusting. I know it's for a good cause but please if you label yourself as a southern restaurant get southern cooks and recipes.",

We tried to order either chicken dishes, but by 7pm they were already out (which seems a little early to me). My husband had the pork roast, which he enjoyed, along with his sides of green beans, mac and cheese, and potatoes. I had the veggie platter- which brings me to another concern. On my veggie platter, I ordered green beans, which ended up being full of bacon chunks (a delightful surprise for most!) which I do not eat and could not exchange. It just made me think that if someone orders a veggie plate, it could be good for the waiter/waitress to advise them that the green beans have on not vegetarian. Just a thought.

    "text": "First, I'd like to say I think the mission of this restaurant is AMAZING. What they do to help the community is beyond commendable.   This review is based on my experience with the food.   Let me just say: I really wanted to love this place. I'd heard it was good and was excited for reservations on New Years Eve. Despite having a reservation, the wait time was about 20 minutes and it looked like they were severely understaffed. With it being a holiday, I imagine they had a lot of call outs.  Overlooking the wait, I was happy to get seated and order a glass of wine! It was good.   I debated what I wanted to order for a long time because everything sounded amazing! I finally decided on Aunt Beaut's Pan Fried Chicken. Yikes, I don't know whose auntie passed down that recipe, but I was not impressed. It literally tasted like no seasoning was added at all. You know it's bad when you have to ask for hot sauce to make it more edible.   The black-eyed peas were good.   The macaroni and cheese and collards were just ok.   Being from the Deep South, when you say \"soul food\" I'm expecting the seasoning to be immaculate and to not want to put my fork down! I would much rather go to a \"hole in the wall\" establishment with better tasting food than a fancy place with food that is so mediocre for the price.   Again, good mission. The food needs work, though. I was not impressed.",

I will say I personally didn't like that they only seat you when half of your part arrives. Especially when there's no one in the restaurant, but rules are rules.   When we sat down our server immediately introduced himself and provided us with glasses of water to start. We had time to scan the menu and select what we wanted for lunch. I chose the fried chicken sandwich with collard greens and slaw on the side.  Our food arrived hot and looked beautiful! Everyone rebased over how delicious the collard greens were. We also tried to figure out the ingredients lol. The food was seasoned very well {southern girls favorite} so I give extra points for that. Our server was nice, I failed catching his name but he was very punctual.",

    "text": "Finally made it here for lunch even though I've been working uptown for a while now.  Went with folks from the office for a farewell lunch, but it was a good experience.  Located right off the main drag on Trade & Church, the space is modern and comfortable.  The glass that surrounds the restaurant has southern recipes all along the perimeter.  We got there around 12ish for the lunch rush, but we were promptly seated and the staff were super friendly and accommodating (even though the place was busy).  Where I was sitting, I had a view of the construction happening across the street.  It was not that long ago that I remember a park being there with a big sculpture.  I think a hotel is going in.  I had the Copain Country Panini and it was delicious.  Frits for my side were crunch and rustically cut.  You can't really go wrong with Pimento cheese, but add it to a sandwich with some arugula and you've got a winner.  I'm also a fan that the owner of this restaurant incorporated their passion in their faith and realizing Restoration Word Ministries.  I know most people may get turned off by attaching a religion onto a restaurant entity, but I did not feel like that was a major player in my lunch experience.  It is a public restaurant that puts its profits and proceeds toward feeding the poor.  They also have a work program to help train and employ people that need it, so I think that's a win for the community in general.",

The cornbread was the worst! It tasted like they just mixed the box ingredients together and baked it. No flavor whatsoever.

The food, service, and drinks were great and I will go back next time in town.   Let's start with the service. It's never easy making everyone in a group happy but somehow our waiter did it. The level of service we received from him was phenomenal and this was with two groups (my group had 8 and the group beside us was about 12). So for them to be able to keep both tables happy, have our food out in a decent time, still have it hot, and no one had any problems with their order shows the level of care they take for their customers.   The food. OMG y'all, this is a southern boys dream. We started off with some Pimento Cheese and Crab Drip and both were on point. The crab dip had just the right amount of seasoning to it so it wasn't overpowering. Others at my table also had the Okra. I didn't personally like it to be honest because it was roasted and not fried but to each their own (update the website says it's fried now). My entree I had the pot roast and it was like my grandma's. I was looking for her to pop out the kitchen and come sit and eat with us. It was that good. No one at our table was disappointed and I have some super opinionated friends.   One thing I have to say before I wrap this up. The one thing I love the most about them is their mission. Please please please go to their website and read what they do. They give opportunity to those that may not have the most options out there. They teach them life skills they can take with them and the best part is that they are a non-profit organization. So give them all your money!   In closing; if you want to make a difference in your local community, have some great food, and be showered with great service check them out!",

The gumbo was pretty tasty but nothing that blew our mind. Quite spicy but we both enjoy spice. Neither dish was out of this world.

For the entree 2 of us got the shrimp and grits.  It was recommended and we both had to do it.   The taste of it was so good.  The shrimp was tasty and the grits were perfect.   Thinking back at it now makes me want more.  It was one of the best tasting entrees I have had in Charlotte.  It cost too much though, at least for what we got.  The serving was too small for 22 dollars when we got less than 10 shrimp and a big bowl.  I'm not complaining though because the taste was great.  I just left a bit hungry.   The other one in our party got the 4 sides option.  No need to talk about anything else but the Creamed Corn.  By far the best on her plate and must get if you are ordering a side.    This place is fantastic taste.  Make the spot and enjoy the story of the restaurant too!",

In fact, we researched the best fried chicken places in the area prior to coming.  King's Kitchen wasn't one of the restaurants that we were going to hit up for fried chicken... we read about this place just having good food so we came here on our last night.  The mister and I ended up ordering... yes, fried chicken. He ordered black eyed peas, collard greens, and Mac and cheese with his fried chicken plate as well as a biscuit... I think that entire plate was like $12... I ordered a fried chicken dinner as well but got their mushrooms and corn bread along with collard greens and Mac & cheese.   The fried chicken... YES... this is what we came all the way here for. This kind of fried chicken. It was perfection. Before coming here in the days before, we had gone to Price's chicken and Bojangles. Sorry, neither of those places come close to the tastiness of King's Kitchen's fried chicken.   Their side dishes.... the mushrooms, you MUST order. It is scrumptious. They use various types of mushrooms and they are all cooked beautifully. The collard greens... order this also!!! The biscuit was dry as was the cornbread... but it didn't matter because everything else was so good. We also ordered their baby kale salad to start off with and that was very refreshing.   Total for everything with a glass of wine, salad, tip and two dinners was like $65 which wasn't bad at all given the quality of the food.  Service was friendly as it was everywhere we went in North Carolina.   Check out this restaurant if you're ever in the area!",

I typically order their meat and sides entree. Ad your meat, you can choose from pork, grilled chicken, fried chicken, fish, etc. They have tons of side options but the corn, mac and cheese, and collards are my favorites.   Their food is upscale Southern and it sure is tasty.",

Then I had the fried chicken (whit meat) with slaw, Mac and cheese and the mushrooms as sides. I must have eaten it in 5 minutes. Delicious! Would highly recommend eating here and that fact that they support the local community makes it all even better.",

    "text": "A friend and I took our 13-year-old sons for dinner.  We love the restaurant's concept of giving back to the community, and the boys were intrigued by the idea of a restaurant that donates all its profits to feed others.    Everyone loved the food.  Started with the hot pimento cheese dip in the bread bowl and only the fact that we were in public prevented a couple of us from licking the plate.  Followed with fried chicken & vegetables (3 of us) and one flounder & vegetables.  All were great -- the collard greens, butter beans, mac & cheese and mashed potatoes were favorites.  The biscuits were delicious -- I haven't had homemade biscuits that good since my grandmother was alive.  Just typing this is making me consider the drive uptown for those biscuits...    We finished by sharing three different desserts because we couldn't decide and wanted to try them.  The caramel cake was good, the s'more mud pie was great, and the banana pudding was so good the boys refused to share.  Servings were substantial; enough to make 13-year-old boys completely full!  Rodney was our server, and he didn't steer us wrong on anything. Get a table in his section and he'll take great care of you.  One more note:  when you get your check, there is a line at the bottom where you can add an amount (separate from the tip) for a donation to feed the hungry.  The servers don't ask you to contribute, so look for that if you're interested in donating.",

Wings (7) were our appetizer and they came with both ranch and bleu cheese. The macaroni was decent & the collards needed a dash of sugar.  Hats off for using Yukon gold potatoes for the potato salad, but it was missing salt and flavor despite the dill.  Cabbage and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes were good.  His salmon was nicely charred and flaky and my chicken was moist and lightly seasoned. The turtle pie was pretty good and the Hummingbird Cake was very tasty.   The decor is nice and the cause is great. We were not offered any of the cornbread which I thought was another well-known item for them. Oh well, we plan to return to try some of the other entrees.",

Because my heart swelled three sizes upon finding out they donate 100% of profits to feeding Charlotte's homeless, I would go again but I didn't find the food to be worth the cost.  The shrimp and grits came with five medium sized pieces of shrimp and about a cup and a half of grits. And while it was delicious, it wasn't $20 worth of food or preparation. Grits may be even cheaper than rice and beans and the shrimp (being a Charlotte restaurant and all) wasn't fresh caught.  Others bought the fried chicken dinner that came with dry cornbread or a biscuit (which was fairly good) and THREE sides for $14. Meh. The chicken wasn't fried long enough so the skin was soggy and juicy -- but not in a good way. In a way that screamed cook me longer. The cabbage isn't soul food cabbage but was quite firm and inedible for us real Southern girls. The macaroni and cheese was very good as was the mashed potatoes.   Another girl ordered the flounder and it didn't say in the description that it was fried. She ordered that because they'd run out of baked chicken and didn't want something the fried heaviness. So much for that.",

It had absolutely no flavor. Quite astonishing, actually. How do you make a sandwich with turkey, bacon, and mayo, and yet it be completely bland. My wife had a \"meat and 3\", fried chicken. The collards were good because of the smoked ham. But otherwise everything was average at best. Portions of the sides were very small. Even though the food was relatively cheap, it still wasn't worth it. I feel sorry for people who live in Charlotte if this is one of the better places downtown. 3/23/12",

Strangely after looking at the menu none of us chose the fried chicken most seem to rave about but still enjoyed everything we received.  The oysters with bacon aoli were good enough that we got a second order and the smoked salmon was great but should come with more crostini.  The short ribs were fall off the bone perfect.  The scallops were perfectly finished but yield my normal complaint of it being too small of a portion.  The pork chop was was nice thick sliced chop properly cooked with a good amount of residual moisture.  Our server was very nice but certainly seemed to be more experienced working a lesser restaurants.  She had very general suggestions with the wine.  I wish I could remember her exact quote on which she preferred the salmon or the flat iron steak but it was something like \"I like the steak better because its bigger\" - ironic that I found this a poor commentary considering small or varied portion size is a pet peeve.  She made of for her lack of knowledge by refilling glasses and checking in several times as we slowly worked out way through dinner.  A discussion when the check came revealed the restaurant's mission.  Next time we'll try the fried chicken too.",

We meet every year in a different American city, and part of my job is to organize a dinner with for the group.  This year, I brought everyone (about 30 people) out to King's Kitchen, and we had a terrific meal.  The food was great, the wine was great, and the service was great.  Our food came out together (a tough feat when plating 30 meal), and everything was really tasty.  So tasty, in fact, that some of our diners were upset when the restaurant ran out of pecan pie (I had some - it was delicious!).  Thanks, King's Kitchen, for a great meal!",

You can easily hear everyone talk.  There were 9 of us and we got a nice table in the side room which gave us our own space.  I'd have to say that my only compliment was the size of my meal.  I got the salmon with pea risotto.  The portion was very small.  But, boy, did it taste fantastic.  I don't even like peas and I loved the risotto.  I noticed the steak meals were well-sized portions.  I had a salad with dressing that was homemade.  Absolutely delicious.  And then I split the brownie dessert with someone.  They add ice cream to it, which is a nice touch.  And, last by not least, I am a sucker for giving back to causes.  I love the concept of this place.  I would definitely go back again!",

    "text": "King's Kitchen is great in theory, and good in actual execution. The story/cause behind the restaurant is amazing, and one you should definitely read up on to truly appreciate the experience if you've never been - worthy of a 1-star bump in and of itself. As for the food, I find it really good at a reasonable price for an uptown sit-down experience.   When I visited this past weekend, I had the fried chicken plate with collard greens, mac-n-cheese, and creamed corn.  The chicken was definitely the highlight, with the collard greens a close 2nd.  The collard greens had a \"kick\" to them that made hot sauce unnecessary - a pleasant surprise. The creamed corn + mac-n-cheese was OK, but nothing to write home about. My wife also had a biscuit w/ muscadine jelly that was really good.  Lastly, the banana pudding was tasty, though nothing too outside of the norm.  Though I didn't partake, the beer list seemed formidable, and there were plenty of wine options, as well. Overall, a good dining experience built upon a great mission of community service in all directions. I'm definitely a fan.",

    "text": "We discovered the existence of King's Kitchen based on a Living Social deal a few weeks ago. After seeing the number of ratings the place had we knew it was worth making the purchase. The deal was for one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert for $25, which was quite awesome. We headed down there for dinner tonight after taking in an afternoon hockey game and spending some time at the Mint Museum.  King's Kitchen is a nice little place right amid the hustle and bustle of Charlotte. Upon entering you find a bright, clean-looking restaurant with one of the nicest bars I've ever seen. I usually opt out of sitting at a bar, but if the need arose I wouldn't have any second thoughts about popping down there. The rest of the indoor tables are a bit close to each other, giving you little privacy, but I've been smushed more by other restaurants. There were also some tables in an outdoor area, but the wind was a bit much to deal with that. We had made reservations so upon entering we were seated quickly and our server came over shortly after to take drinks and whatnot.  We were a bit limited on what to order since there was a separate menu for those using the Living Social deal (something that was not mentioned anywhere on Living Social), and I wasn't crazy about the choice of appetizers. We ended up settling on the pimiento cheese ($5) with lavash (sp), which ended up being these really light crackers. The pimiento cheese had a nice spice to it, and definitely went well with the cracker. There was definitely an excess of cheese to cracker, at least for us, since the cheese was a bit much (spicy and rich) to be spread too abundantly over the crackers. They did offer us bread to sop up the remainder of the cheese which was nice, but with two full meals coming we decided to not stuff ourselves.  For dinner I ordered the fried chicken ($13) with butter beans, sea island red peas and roasted carrots. I went with the white meat, which consisted of breast and wing. The batter is nice and light, but I wish it had come out a bit crisper. The flavor was totally there and it tasted great, but the chicken was a bit drier than other fried chicken breast I've had. The butter beans were awesome, but I wasn't a fan of the red peas. I had never had them before so I have nothing to compare them to, but I just wasn't a fan of the overall flavor. The roasted carrots were crazy good, and I never thought I'd be raving about carrots after any meal. They are char broiled so they have all the black char on them and they are so soft and flavorful...almost tasted like sweet potatoes!  The only fish on the limited menu was fried flounder ($14), but the miss' isn't a big fan of fried foods. Luckily the folks at Kings Kitchen were kind enough to substitute that for the blackened catfish ($20) at no upcharge, which I was very grateful for. This blackened catfish knocked my socks off. It had the PERFECT level of spice...I like enough spice where my nose will run, but not too hot where I have to chug a gallon of milk after each little bite. This blackening spice was right at the threshold for me, where it met the maximum but did not stray over even a little. She also got the mac & cheese, creamed corn and collard greens. The mac & cheese  was good, but a little too mushy for us. I really loved the creamed corn...it had this sweetness to it that made it the perfect side. I was not a fan of the collards, but I don't really like any greens, so don't take my word on the collards to heart.  For dessert we split the chocolate and peanut butter cake with vanilla gelato.  I don't usually rave about a dessert, but this one is definitely worthy of it. The cake is a couple of layers of chocolate, peanut butter and ganache with some crispy layers thrown in also. The contrast of the soft cake to the crispiness worked well, and the ganache was simply indulgent. Then you had the heaping scoop of vanilla bean gelato. It was soooo rich and thick and the miss' detected a hint of some spice (possibly cinnamon) that really brought the flavor out. When you combined a little spoon of gelato with a spoon of the cake, you really had the ultimate dessert.  Kings Kitchen definitely dishes out some slammin' Southern cuisine, and I love that they do it for a good cause at a great price with heaping portions. While some of the food was totally spot on, some of it was also lacking a bit. If I could dish out 4 1/2 stars I would, but I think there are a couple of things keeping it from 5 stars. Still, I totally recommend heading down to get some serious eats on.",

My dinner companions said the chicken was good but not any better than popeye's however everyone said their sides were fantastic. I ordered the Mac n cheese as my side and it was better than out of the box but nothing special. Bottom line a good meal but if you are expecting \"soul food\" like Sunday dinners at your grandma's house expect to be disappointed. That being said, still one of the best meals Charlotte.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my dining experience here for the most part.  I am born in raised in north Florida though and have very high standards for southern cuisine.  I dined with my girlfriend and we had a Living Social for 1 app, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert.  Good thing we did though because I still ended up spending $40 on 4 drinks and the tip.   But hey, it's uptown, I need to start accepting that.....Or should I?  I thoroughly enjoyed the fried oyster appetizer.  It came with a bacon vinaigrette and cocktail sauce for dipping.  I wasn't wowed by the vinaigrette like I thought I would be, but the cocktail sauce made up for it.  We both ordered the meat and 3, and we both ordered flounder as the meat!  I always try to order something different from her, but I just wasn't feeling the other options of salmon, flank steak, or fried chicken (yes, the chicken was tempting, but I didn't want to have to pick at anything during my meal).  I thought the flounder was fried perfectly.  It was a little salty, but I have a salty palate so I liked it.  The sides are what I really thought could have been better.  When I think about southern cuisine, it's all about the sides, bottom line.  I ordered the mac n' cheese, cheese grits, and mashed (creamed) potatoes.  The potatoes were pretty good, but I make better mac n' cheese and grits at home.  When I go out for southern cuisine, I want to eat food that's better than what I make myself.  The mac didn't have enough cheese and tasted very eggy.  The grits weren't thick enough and made me wish I had ordered something different.  I can't really remember what she had as sides, oh well.....  The dessert left something to be desired as well.  It didn't taste homemade, but who knows.  We had the turtle pie.  I would eat here again with a Living Social, but honestly if I'm in search of getting my southern fat kid on, I'm heading over to Dish.",

Normally when I eat, I seem to end up eating my meat first and veggies/sides last. Well this was a first. The creamed potatoes and cabbage were the two best things on my plate! They were finished before anything. The mac and cheese was good also. The fried chicken was not the best I've ever had, but definitely not bad.   The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the cornbread. Weird, especially since they have a bakery attached, but the cornbread was not good at all. One bite, and I placed it on the side, and never touched it.  I also had the cheese plate appetizer which was delicious.",

After several minutes to ponder my path tonight, I arrived at Jimmy's wings, the peach glazed pork chop with hoppin Jon and finished with banana pudding.  I remember sitting back from my chop and dreading my last bite as this amazing dish was coming to an end.  I have traveled the country and eat in a lot of great chop houses and no where can even touch what the executive chef has created here.  Words cannot describe the flavor that crosses your lips on every bite.  Watching other diners around me, I noticed the same look of extreme satisfaction on their faces as well from the first bite to the end.  Finally, the banana pudding was as sweet and smooth as silk.

There were 10 of us and when we called about an hour ahead as we usually do in these situations, we were told they didn't have room for a party our size as they already had reservations for several parties. The lunch was for a coworker's birthday and she wanted to go anyway, so we did and ended up all having to sit at the bar, which was fine. I'm glad we stuck it out! The decor is modern and a little funky but very nice and classy. The staff we encountered were all friendly, helpful and quick and the food was really good! I think everyone in our group enjoyed what they got. And the lunch prices were really very reasonable... the only thing we were a bit put off by was the high price of the desserts (all $6 each - the meals themselves were $7-10 for the most part so it seemed odd to pay almost that much for a average size slice of cake/pie) but a few of us indulged anyway and everything was delicious. I personally don't eat out uptown often at all but if I'm ever presented with the opportunity to eat there again, I definitely will and I recommend it to anyone who wants to check it out. Oh... and all of this is on top of the fact that they some (or all?) of their profit goes to help the homeless in our community.",

(side note: my mom grew up in the kitchen and in deeply southern fam and produced perfectly prepared southern classics, then she became a schooled gourmet chef in her spare time bc she wanted to broaden her art) anyway, the mac'n'cheese tasted exactly like my aunts, which is my favorite on earth, simple, classic...perfect. the creamed potatoes w/ white gravy and black eyed peas freaked me out b/c they were EXACTLY like my moms, yes, i know one of the reason why is bc they use bacon fat in a lot of the veggies....GOOD that stuff is what dreams are made of and these two veggies blew me away... and finally the skillet fried chicken, thick crispy crust, perfectly cooked, lightly seasoned, pretty sure the use peanut oil to fry their chicken and it tasted EXACTLY and I mean EXACTLY like my grandmothers which isnt the best friend chicken i have ever had but it was phenomenal. i think there can be different types of friend chicken and if you want good old classically prepared fried chicken this is the best in charlotte, followed closely by myers park cc and then probably prices. they brought us some perfect biscuits and delicious cornbread to start, she got the flounder and was blown away by it and the collards (which they brought out with the proper side cars in both types of vinegars) we also got a really good rose to drink. we had a perfect server, dylan who we knew had recently started working there and he treated us perfectly and he knows his stuff. i was really really impressed by the place and will def be back many many times in the future. hats off to jim noble once again, this guy knows what he is doing and is doing it for the greater good which is to be commended.",

    "text": "Southern fare for the greasy at heart  Work buddy & I came to King's Kitchen right after arriving in Charlotte - she was looking for something farm to table-esque & had been here before & liked it a lot  Started w/ a couple of beers & man oh man do they have an awesome selection!  I chose the Duck Rabbit Stout & it was bold & creamy & had a lovely chocolate undertone - perfect for me!  Work buddy chose a darker IPA, as recommended by our waiter & he steered her right - she loved the balance of hops but no bitterness  Offering NO real veggie entrees except for \"Plate of Southern Vegetables\" which is a combo of 4 veggie side dishes & a biscuit ( pathetic! ), I got an appie & a side for my meal & chose the Sweet Potato Fritter and the Mac N Cheese  The fritters were awful - I was expecting something semi-light like a hush puppy but these were dense & heavy & completely over-fried to the point they were almost black & hot as napalm....totally burned my mouth throughout the meal - they never cooled down!    Even so, these fritters were still raw on the inside - not sure how that could be accomplished.  There was way too much ginger & not enough sweet potato flavor & the honey dipping sauce which I suspected had a ton of corn syrup in it, due to its abnormally thick consistency, just put everything over the top  The Mac N Cheese came out in this teeny bowl & it also had a greasy consistency to it - no stringy pulls of cheese but a gloopy, congealed bechamel w/ strong white pepper flavor  And from those glowing descriptions, it's obvious I was not a fan of my \"meal\" at all - left over half & this is coming from a Southern girl who loves her comfort food!!  - 2 stars!  Work buddy got the Shrimp & Grits & it was classic NOLA / Southern deliciousness - creamy grits & they didn't skimp on the shrimp!  She was a fan - 4 Stars  All adds up to an average 3 Stars - I prob wouldn't come back here to eat but to indulge in their wide variety of beers, that'd be a different story",

    "text": "Wow! We were sitting at another resturaunt in the Epicenter and looking over a menu that looked less than appetizing. My husband jumped on Yelp and discovered this place is only a couple blocks away. This was the best decision of the night! This restaurant has such a cute shabby-chic factor that I love and a few private dining rooms that I'm possibly interested in reserving in the future. My husband and I tried the pot roast, fried chicken, creamed potatoes and gravy, creamed corn, collard greens, green beans, and macaroni and cheese. The sides are the most amazing Southern tasty treats I have ever had! We had banana pudding for dessert and it was so delicious. We brought friends from out of state and they loved it! My husband and I will definitely be back. The great thing about this establishment is that it is completely non profit and all proceeds go to feeding the homeless in Charlotte. What a great way to give back to your community by dining here. This is a must stop for Uptown Charlotte. As an added bonus, there is a full bar!",

And while every penny of profit at The King's Kitchen has a higher calling, each bite of the food served to patrons, features Chef Jim Nobel's \"New Local Southern Cuisine.\" Specialties include premium Carolina organic produce paired with fine southern meats!  So that first paragraph is a synopsis of the establishments mission...feed the body, nourish the soul and help thy neighbor... and nobody does it better!  Fresh, tasty and ALL done to perfection.  On our lunch menu for this Wednesday afternoon, Ms Funk and I shared:  A Beet salad with Goat Lady Chevre, Arugula, Toasted Almonds & Sorghum Vinaigrette. The addition of chicken or grilled salmon was available, we opted to pass as our Pannini had chicken. A perfect combination of sweet and savory.  A Sourdough Panini with Tomato, Arugula, Pimento Cheese and perfectly grilled Chicken that could not have been tastier paired with the house prepared potato salad, possibly the best we've ever had.  Ms Funkette chose the day's special: A steak burger with local lettuce, tomato, house prepared condiments and frites on the side... and yes it was a beautifully prepared medium rare steak. Not ground, not chopped but perfectly grilled and tender!  Maybe you've picked up on the whole \"perfect\" thing going on at this eatery.  Well, that would be perfectly fine with us!",

The chicken was decent but not that fresh and all of the sides were disappointing and salty.

We ordered the cheese plate which had three great local North Carolina cheeses. We also had two of the daily specials, the grouper and the strip steak.  The presentation was fantastic as was the food.  And it was deliciously clean as it seemed void of over seasoning, butters, or creams.  We will be back!",

I'm not sure what has caused the noticeable change, but the service has been pretty bad the last two times I've been there in recent months. And the food? Not what it used to be. This was one of my fave, go-to places in Charlotte (I'd recommended it a dozen times to friends, uptown coworkers, & out-of-towners), but no more. Even 3-stars seems generous at this point.  Food took forever to order & receive both times. Orders were wrong. We never got any corn bread (despite asking for it twice!). Water refills were non-existent. Dessert was not impressive. It could just be me, but it appears they don't offer the same amount of side items anymore (or they've changed their variety to less healthy options that no longer appeal to me). And did their portions get smaller while their prices got bigger? Again, it could just be me. Or perhaps I'm more sensitive to the prices when the food & service are so disappointing.  My husband had visited a few other times for lunch and warned me, but I tried to stay optimistic and hoped he was wrong about the changes. Alas, he was right (as usual!), and I'm left searching for a new, favorite dinner spot.",

We were impressed to see that this man fulfilled his request without a question by walking to the kitchen door (which was open to the outside) and calling into the cooks to prepare the man outside a burger to his liking.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place out since we moved here, and last night my boyfriend and I finally got our opportunity. We came at 8 pm for dinner, probably a little later than their normal customer base on a Monday night, but we did not feel unwelcome. we were immediately sat and given refreshments. I am a vegetarian, so I was so excited that I could get a meal of just sides--- i guess this may not be every vegetarians dream, but it is mine. We love good hearty southern food, and that is exactly what this place delivered. We started with the pimento cheese and bread, which set the tone for an amazing meal, it was some of the best pimento cheese ever, and the bread was perfect! literally everything we ate we commented on how excellent it was. I'm mad we didn't try this place sooner! for the price, you get a ton of food... it feels as though your eating thanksgiving dinner, above that, your money goes to a great cause! This place is a MUST try.",

    "text": "I really like KK. The decor is wonderful, and I don't usually comment on decor--it's simple, tasteful, and genuine, just like the food. Breakfast biscuits are a bit pricey but Huge, with thick cut bacon. I had one phenomenal shrimp and grits dinner where every bite was perfection and then another meal where my fried chicken was really dry, so I'm not sure how consistent it is--time will tell. The bacon cornbread appetizer radiates butter, but it's delicious and worth the temporary waddle. If you are uptown and jonesing for meat and three, this is a good standby.  I want to power down a star for the bakery bread, but can't bring myself to because I really do like what they are trying to do. The baguettes are all sourdough (strange and taste specific), and one was already fairly stale the day I bought it. Still, I think they are working on getting the bakery wheels turning steadily, so that's okay. And I know if I had gone back and said it was a little old, they probably would have given me a fresh one without a fuss. Nice folks work here.  Update--this place has stayed interesting, but the addition of a massive cross in the center of the dining room is a bit much. It's pretty churchy vibe now, less like a quiet urban southern food today than it was.",

Buttery, flaky croissants stuffed with ham n cheese, Swiss n mushroom or chocolate. Yum-o!! The Danish are light, sweet and full of flavor.  The Sweets include, a to die for brioche sticky bun, sticky, sweet and topped with pecans, excellent with a coffee. Muffins are tender and loaded with nuts or fruit. The cookies...huge and crispy, soft. All things considered, the grab-N-go grabbed my taste buds and took them on a most delicious ride.

I love supporting a local place over a chain--King's Kitchen is a non-profit, with 100% of profits going to feed Charlotte's homeless AND they employ homeless and give them job skills to be successful in the restaurant industry.  I ordered lunch and had a glass of wine while I waited.  (Washed my hands before eating and the restroom was spotless.)  The Event Coordinator, Joseph, let my friend and I both try the glass of wine we ordered before we bought it, and made wine suggestions based on what we liked, (ie: I said I liked Pinot Grigio, not too sweet, and he suggested the Pinot Gris.  My friend loved Chardonnay--Joseph said he had a Napa Chard and a French Chard, and the French was his favorite.)  Nowhere else does that.  The sandwich I got-sourdough Panini with chicken, was fantastic.  The sourdough had the right amount of butter, and had grill marks like it had been done on a real grill, as opposed to something electric.  The chicken breast was a good size, and the pimento cheese on the sandwich was so good.  The flavor and texture of the beans was fantastic--flavored with pork and not mushy like some.   Atmosphere was fantastic so I was definitely not wanting to go back to work.  Can't wait to bring people here.  I've passed this place so many times and I'm only mad I didn't try it sooner!",

At 8, they were out of fried chicken, one of their signature dishes. The resturant was only 1/3 full at this time of night, and the kicthen seemed to be struggling to keep up. The bread hit our table exactly 2 minutes before our entree. My meal, shrimp and grits, was near perfect.   My husband ordered the pan seared scallops, and was told he would get 3 scallops on a bed of succotash. Well, what he got was 1 scallop, and another scallop that was sliced in half. How do we know? First it was thin, then we saw each was only seared on one side--because it was cut in half!  My son's porkchop was grossly overcooked.....way too dry. We will pay for a good meal, but to order something and not get it...not cool. We spend a lot of time in Charlotte, but we will never come back here again. Would I recommend this place?  No!  If I could have given it a zero I would have.",

One reason we came was because of the generous background of the restaurant, and the fact that they use their profits for a good cause.  They gave us a private area for our meal, which was really nice except that we were split into 2 tables. Our waitress was really nice and attentive, but slow. She struggled to open our wine bottles, but she worked really hard to please us. She had much more patience with my parents, who could not pick a wine, than I would have. She also lit the candles on the cake we brought in and cut it for us. I really liked her, even though she would disappear for a long time. We ended up spending 3 hours there for dinner.  My food was good. I loved the cornbread, and the biscuits were great! I loved the moscato that we ordered by the bottle. I had the sweet potato fritters, which were really good especially with honey. I ordered the pork chop, which was good considering I don't usually eat that. I recently discovered brussel sprouts (because my mom didn't like them, I ate them for the first time this year at the age of 23!) and they were made with vinegar I believe, the macaroni and cheese was good, and I don't remember what else I had. The portion sizes were small, but really I think they're what normal people eat and we should stop expecting plates that feed 4. NC has a high enough obesity rate.",

The service was great and the  waitress was knowledgeable of the food and the beers.  But when my food arrives the drumstick seemed like it had been taken out from yesterdays cooking and microwaved.   The thigh was pretty good as was the rest of the plate but it was cold.  I don't understand it because the food was so great the last time.  Hopefully the coldness of the food was a glitch... but a tough and tasteless chicken leg from a place that is suppose to specialize in fried chicken is unforgivable.",

They were amazing about getting me a fairly last minute reservation for 9 people and we ended up with kind of a private room. Our server was really great especially with all the special requests we had going on. We tried the pimento cheese dip and crostini which I actually really liked a lot. I went for the pan fried chicken and for my 3 sides I did the southern green beans, mac and cheese, and creamed corn. So first off, they were out of white meat, it was a bit of a disappointment, but not a deal breaker. The chicken was okay, but not a ton of flavor. There just wasn't any spice to it. The green beans were delicious, and the mac and cheese was seriously work dying for!! I was instantly transported to Sunday potlucks at church. I'm talking True southern mac and cheese, yumm! The corn was decent, but I could have done with double mac and cheese and been happier. I also got a biscuit which was delicious. Normally in a situation like this I'd probably only give 3 stars because the food wasn't super impressive. However there were enough items I liked, the service was fantastic, and the Bordeaux we got was a great choice. I love the purpose of the restaurant as well and that alone is enough for another star. I'd come back to try something else and get a vat of mac and cheese lol.",

Why no cobbler, sweet potato pie or even Red Velvet cake was odd to us but maybe they are not known for those offerings.  Where it went bad was the SERVICE!  I gave it 3 stars only for the food The service was terrible.  We had an older gentlemen who acted as if were bothering him asking questions about the menu.  He took his time taking our order and was very slow on bring the drinks.  My friends ordered  wine and it was poured in a beer glass??? He never brought us water until we reminded him on his third trip to the table.  When he brought the food he smelled of cigarette smoke which meant he took some sort of break while our food was cooking.  Not exactable.  Makes me wonder if he even washed his hands upon his return.  Since his service was mediocre at best his tip reflected as such.

    "text": "The Kings Kitchen was the answer to my \"where to eat after our quickie wedding\" prayers. The owner of the restaurant, Jim Noble, has a few other restaurants in Charlotte. I've eaten at one of them. Noble's, and it was fantastic. But a bit pricier than I wanted my new husband to have to deal with. I saw a link to The King's Kitchen, and after checking out the website, I was in love. The food was very southern, but I was immediately drawn to the salmon AND what they do for the community. So, I told my husband about it, made the reservation and anticipated a delicious meal.  After our short & sweet wedding, we headed downtown for dinner. We had reservations, but they weren't incredibly busy, so we probably would have been fine without one. We were seated quickly and our server greeted us promptly. He took our drink orders, came back and we ordered a few appetizers for the table. We ordered the deviled eggs & the pimento cheese. I can't comment on the pimento cheese, since I don't care for it and didn't try it, but the eggs were delicious. He also brought out two plates of biscuits with homemade strawberry jam and cornbread. Everyone raved about the cornbread. I had a biscuit with some jam and it was delicious, but nothing special.  The entrees came out quickly and everyone was more than pleased. I had the salmon with the pea risotto, which was fantastic. The salmon had a lime butter on top and the risotto was perfect. And the color was gorgeous and interesting. I was very pleased with the flavors of this dish (the salmon was some of the best I've ever had).   Several members of our table ordered the pot roast. I had a bite of my husband's and it melted in my mouth. I've never had a roast that was that tender and had such great flavor. My new mother in law had the fried flounder. I had a bite of that and it was incredible as well. Everyone loved their side items (the mashed potatoes, creamed corn & macaroni and cheese were HUGE hits), and almost everyone was pleased with their entrees. My new brother in law ordered the fried chicken, and while it looked delicious, he said their was so much grease it actually became unappetizing the more he looked at it.   Other than the fried chicken, the dinner was a huge success, and a fantastic evening was had by all. And while I loved my delicious dinner, I love what the restaurant does for the community and that just makes me want to go there over and over again. Anyone in Charlotte needs to try it out.",

Great non-profit mission based restaurant that wants to make a difference to the local community and serving some of the best comfort food I have had in a long time.  Today was extremely cold and windy, and really needed a pick me up. the hosts set me up with the Tomato Bisque (best tomato bisque I have ever had) with extra crostini's, and a cup of mac & cheese.   I have dined here in the past, and the atmosphere is pretty great. If you are new to the area, come check it out. Be aware that this place is pretty popular so be prepared for a wait if you arrive during peak hours for dinner, especially later on in the week.   take care, and excited to see what else these guys will do in the future!  -Z.A.K",

Best comfort meal ever!  And make sure you save room for sweets after - the banana pudding is to DIE for.  I was a little disappointed last time I went - they changed their menu slightly and no longer had the pimento cheese spread. They had a dip that was equally as good - but I missed the spread!

    "text": "I was lead to this place because of an appearance that I'd saw on OWN. So, the following week I made reservation for this place and specifically (in my reservation notes) asked to be placed far away from high traffic. When we were seated, we just happened to be in a high traffic area. I went to the front and asked to be moved (ironically a manager was the one who placed us) and was advised that we could sit at the bar or wait for another table to open. At this point, I was beyond frustrated because I'd already had a lot of other things going on, and was intentional about my request in the reservation--at the least, I thought I could have been told about the seating upon arrival. A few moments later, the manager came over and offered a free appetizer... pimento cheese. I'm not the biggest fan of the stuff, but didn't want to interact much more because I was already \"bothered\" by what had happened; however, I didn't want to carry on being a pain in the rear. As I centered myself, I was able to recognize the gesture to \"make it right.\" Even when I shared with him that I thought pimento cheese was \"okay,\" he offered to get me something else if I'd wished. I appreciate this calmness, patience, and willingness to see that I had a good experience. It's not something that he had to do, but he did and that was much appreciated.  Nonetheless, up having an incredible server! She was super wonderful about helping us navigate the menu and make dinner choices. Further, she took time to answer our questions about the establishment in general--helping us to understand how the restaurant was involved in the community, events that take place through the year, and shared how the menu changes with the seasons.   The food, including the pimento cheese, ended up being wonderful as well. My husband had the fried chicken, collard, greens, butter beans, and biscuit. I ended up with the roast, mushroom, collard greens, and corn bread. I recommend all of it. I also enjoyed the fried okra as well. Hubby got the cup of gumbo and found it to be a bit spicy for his liking, but if spice is your life, go for it! I tried my husband's  biscuit and the honey spread... it made me regret that I hadn't just ordered a whole plate of biscuits and honey... so, so, so good.   When I left, I forgot that I was even frustrated when I first arrived. I was grateful that the experience itself and would certainly go back. The atmosphere is great and menu has awesome selections.",

    "text": "I took a group of 20 people here recently for a business dinner.  I primarily chose this restaurant because I work for a not for profit and we believe strongly in community so the King's Kitchen seemed like the perfect place to host our team dinner.  We had a pre-set menu which included the options of Pot Roast, Salmon, Fried Chicken, Vegetable Risotto and collard greens, mashed potatoes and mac n cheese as our side items with the two dessert choices being banana pudding and coconut cake.  First of all my group was really impressed with the selections of beer and wine.  The demographic of my group consisted of a bunch of 23 year olds with a few of us old fogies around to pay the bill.  They are all into different kinds of beer and raved to me about the selections available.  Upon arrival I asked the server for some of the \"Starters\" from the regular menu and the kitchen staff did their best to accommodate this last minute request.  Although it did seem to be a big deal (I thought restaurants like it when you order MORE food).  Not sure if they only have so many servings available per night but I'm not judging them on this.  The Sweet Potato Fritters were AMAZING, the Cheese Plate was beautiful and the Pimento Cheese was my favorite thing.  My only feedback would be to give more pieces of bread to go with it.  It was a huge ball of cheese with only a small amount of sliced baguette.    We started with the Gumbo  and a Salad which I had never had before but thoroughly enjoyed and those who had the salad said it was so good.    The mashed potatoes were perfect, the gravy was so flavorful, the mac n cheese was absolutely fabulous.  We also had collard greens which I liked but some mentioned that there seemed to be too much smoke flavoring in the greens themselves.  We all agreed that the bacon in the greens would not give the greens THAT much smoky flavor.  But EVERYONE ate them regardless.  I had 2 servings.  YUM.  Now about my FAVORITE thing in the world......FRIED CHICKEN.  OMG this was by far the BEST fried chicken I have ever had.  Not dry at all and so full of flavor.  I think I even dreamt about it that night.  So Good.  My group had the pot roast and the salmon and all said their dinner was amazing.    They served the banana pudding in small jars which was a nice touch.  The coconut cake was really good according to my group but I went with the banana pudding which I was IN LOVE with.  It looked like browned marshmallow on top, layers of fresh bananas, pudding and cookies were so good that I wished I had taken one TO GO!    Our server was a delight and every front of house staff member thanked us and said goodnight.  We felt very welcomed and I personally cannot wait to come back again........and again when I'm in Charlotte on business.  Highly recommended.",

The story of The King's Kitchen reflects well upon this city as it has helped Noble's ministry thrive. I hope this story adds more chapters and successes as the years go by.",

    "text": "Was in Charlotte on business last night and decided to have dinner here based on all the positive reviews on Yelp. Once again, fellow Yelpers did not disappoint.   My colleague and I had a wonderful experience from start to finish. The ambience is inviting and well appointed- it was so refreshing to a) have an INCREDIBLE playlist (nostalgic '70's hits -think Stevie Wonder, Jackson 5, James Taylor), and b) be able to enjoy the music AND the dinner conversation at the same time. WHOA....ok, yeah, I just realized how that sounded. I'm old.  Well, if being old means I can enjoy good music, good conversation and a meal so good that if blindfolded I would have sworn my Mamaw were cooking in the kitchen? Then, yeah- go ahead and issue me my AARP card a couple years early.   We started with the pimento cheese spread as a starter. Excellent choice. Came with toasted french bread brushed with olive oil. I loved the fact that when my friend and I got dangerously low in the bread to cheese ratio, the bus boy noticed and brought out extra bread, of his own accord! Who does that nowadays??? It's the little things like that which make a good experience GREAT.   Our waitress, Angela was top notch. Attentive and professional, never once leaving us to want for a thing. In fact, everyone working last night seemed so pleasant. So happy, engaged, productive....the front of the house as well as the back of the house. It was really refreshing.   But I digress, back to the food.   We both ordered a \"meat & 3\" w/ fried chicken. The sides ranged from creamed corn, mashed potatoes, green beans, black eyed peas & collard beans.  Everything tasted like you hoped/dreamed/prayed it would. I swear.   We finished off the meal by splitting a piece of the homemade lemon merengue pie.   I cannot recommend this place enough. Not only is it on point in terms of its gastronomic prowess from an American comfort food standpoint, but the folks working there are doing so for reasons other than just putting food in our mouths. It's an organization that helps individuals learn skills to assist getting back on their feet after experiencing various challenges in life.   Not only did I leave last night with a full belly, but I just felt like all was right in the world- somehow good chicken = good karma.",

I chose the fried chicken and it was very good made southern style. The sides were mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese and coleslaw. I loved the potatoes! My kids loved the Mac and cheese with a panini which was pretty standard. The sweet tea was delicious. Our server was filled with humor and hospitality. The kitchen helps homeless learn the job trade so it was also a great feeling supporting the community. They have a covered patio that is huge and inviting. Large bar in the center. Wish I would've looked at the standard menu. Next time!",

I also got a cup of the gumbo which was pretty stellar.  I ordered the Southern Risotto and the Hubby got the pork chop.  Both were the perfect combo of savory with a hint of salt.   My cousin got the shrimp and grits.  She's a pretty particular eater, and being from up north, was not sure what grits was all about but low and behold, she loved it!   The staff could not have been nicer, and truth be told, I really appreciate their mission.  I would certainly come here more often if it was a bit closer to us.    We did get two desserts to try at the end- brownie cheesecake and banana cream pie.  Really fun looking, but both were lacking in flavor for this girl.",

Service was warm, sincere, and fast.  Menu changes frequently.  One tiny complaint: the cornbread was bland. Not bad, but not as delightful as the rest of the meal.

Tastes yummy more like a donut dessert - crab cakes.  It's only one piece for $15.  But it's made with mostly crab.  Really awesome.  Highly recommended.   Then I had the grouper entree.  The fish was perfectly cooked.  Wasn't a fan of the farro though. Over seasoned.   They were kind enough to remake but still over seasoned for my taste.  Maybe I just prefer most things light on salt  Overall a great experience and the food came out fast which was great since we were hungry.  Definitely worth trying and the price was right.",

This has happened more than once at The Kings Kitchen. On this particular visit they were out of both lemonade and creamed corn. I seem to always enjoy the BBQ Baked Chicken which on this visit it was rather dry. This was my first time trying the potatoe salad it wasn't the worst but was on the equivalent to a restaurant wholesale brand. Will not be doing that again.

All profits go towards feeding the hungry and helping to educate their staff members. It's truly remarkable to know as you pay for your meal that you are helping change someone's life.   Now let's get to the review......The interior of this restaurant is great. Very country modern- a look I love! They also have a nice outdoor patio for you to enjoy. If you're looking for a quick lunch try sitting at the bar area too!   I've been here twice for lunch and it's always been pretty busy. The service isn't amazing, but the food has always been delicious! I've had the deviled eggs for an appetizer which is a must. I haven't ventured out of the menu too much, but the chicken panini is great. It's comes with pimento cheese, arugula and a marinated tomato. The sandwich is a little messy since the tomato is marinated, but it will do with a knife and fork.   Plus, they have a large selection of southern sides including mashed potatoes, collard greens, fried okra, creamed corn and more! Actually they have 15 daily sides. Holy cow!!!! My favorite side I had was the daily special-yellow squash and zucchini (with tons of butter of course!). You can even get a \"veggie\" plate which includes your selection of 4 sides if you want to try a little bit of everything.   I've heard their dinner menu is amazing so I'll definitely have to check it out again! Stay tuned!",

Our server was friendly and attentive, I had gumbo which was cooked and seasoned perfectly and a little gem salad with pears& pecans the vinagrette dressing was complimentary it let The vegetables shine without overpowering the dish. My friend had the Kale salad she really enjoyed the salad especially the chick peas. I can't wait to go back and try more. Two different people raved about the pot roast.",

    "text": "So I yelped this place before coming to Charlotte on business and liked the idea that all the profits go to feed the hungry in town. When I went it was early in the night around 5 right when they open. I was the only one there and my server took the time to explain the whole story to me and provide recommendations for drinks and food. I could tell he was really passionate about the place and whether you're into the religious piece of it or not, it's a really great cause regardless. Then to top it off, the food was perfect. I started with the sweet potato fritters with honey and they were hot, crispy and perfectly fried (definitely sweet so if you'd prefer to start savory maybe start with something else, but they were great for me!) For my entree I got the fried chicken and three sides (collards which were awesome, black eyes peas and Mac and cheese). If I had to pick, I'd say I could have gone without the Mac and cheese but it's also because I ordered so much food!   I would definitely recommend this place if you're in Charlotte looking for some high quality Southern food... And last, but most importantly, the homemade biscuits are worth going back for on their own and they offered me extra to take on the road.",

At lunch, they used to serve you biscuits and corn bread before your meal. The cornbread is now served with the meal. So, I don't understand why they still give me a side plate.   The prices are reasonable for dinner, but they're a bit steep for lunch. $15 for fried chicken plate, and $19 for salmon plate.",

It's in a great Uptown location just off Tyron and nestled on the corner across from the park. We sat along a window and ordered iced tea, received a variety of bread (love some cornbread!) and ordered our lunch entrees. I got flounder with a choice of 3 sides- I opted for mac and cheese, green beans and cole slaw. Y-u-m!   The best part about King's Kitchen is that it's for a good cause- from the website:  \"We're a not for profit restaurant serving up southern cuisine made with fresh, local ingredients from right here in our community. And the proceeds go back to the community, helping to feed those in need. So, come on in. Because when you dine, the whole community thrives.\"  I'm a big fan of supporting those in need, so King's Kitchen gets an extra star for this alone. Looking forward to my return!  Fun tip: they have great pastries in the morning. My boyfriend got a spiced muffin and scones on his way to work- they should definitely advertise this, because they'd knock the competition out of the park.",

We both got the fried chicken (dark as they were out of white) I got potato salad, Mac and cheese, and black eyed peas. The black eyed peas were to die for. I've never had any that good from a restaurant, the Mac and cheese was also pretty solid. And I'm very critical of Mac and cheese. The potato salad was just alright. My friend got the greens, creamed corn and potatoes and gravy. She said they were all very good as well. My only gripe would be to offer your vegetables without pork as well. As someone who doesn't eat pork I had to get a salad instead of greens or green beans because both contain ham. The only other complaint would be the lack of liquor. I do enjoy wine. But sometimes a good crafty cocktail and can take a meal over the top. Other than that it was great service. Very reasonably priced and a nice place. Definitely will come back with my family!",

    "text": "Visiting The Kings Kitchen, I had very high hopes. By the end of the night, my hopes were let down a tad bit. We had 8:30pm reservations, but by the time we were seated, it was around 8:45pm. We did not receive drinks(water) until 9:20pm, and our food around 9:35. We waited almost an hour before eating, and I know it was busy for a saturday night, but an HOUR!?! Come one people, do better! The food was ok, the waiters were nice but ALWAYS on the go. The bbq wings we received for an appetizer were not cooked all the way thoroughly, and although they replaced them with more, it left a bad taste in our mouths of the cook. How can you serve bloody chicken wings at a restaurant?! Also,  I was very disappointed when I found out they did NOT serve liquor, only a few beers and a few selections of wine. 2 thumbs down in my book.  We all tried the \"corn bread\" and only 2 out of 5 enjoyed it. I felt it was a little too \"wet\" for my liking.  I ordered the fried chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens. The chicken was juicy and delicious. The mac&cheese was ok, but the collard greens had a little too much vinegar for me. I did not like them at all. My sister had the fried chicken, mac&cheese, collard greens and carrots, she loved it all. My mother had the fried chicken, black eye peas, mac&cheese & collard greens. She liked it all except the black eyed peas, which she thought were a bit mushy. The rest of the table tried cabbage and corn as a side, which they thought were delicious, while a friend also had the tilapia and she enjoyed it alot.   Would I go again? Maybe, but not for a very long time.",

Coming into this place it looked very much in its element, which means that it is very elegant, with a open bar, simple clean tables with very upscale silver, china, and stemware.  Very fitting for being at the end of the block down from Trade and Tryon.  The menu is also simple and elegant, with choices for the not-so-hungry and the very hungry.  I had seen the reviews on Yelp, so I had the Fried Chicken with 3 sides.  Everything was just perfect.  The chicken was perfect, mac and cheese perfect, stewed tomatoes perfect, creamed corn PERFECT.  One thing I did not notice until \"checkout\" is that there is a place to put an additional donation at the bottom of your receipt, which will be added to your (credit card) bill.  Even without an additional donation, I suppose a nonprofit would be a preferred location if you want to help out.  O-O I'll be back !!",

Yes I was very rude not the first time here come on to charge these prices give me some good food! Ok as for the homeless they were begging me before I came in to eat close this place down!!!!! Is this place a scam for something eles?",

The flounder was absolutely delicious.  It was fresh and light and the batter was delicious and crispy.  The macaroni and cheese was just the right balance of crisp cheese and well-cooked pasta.  Please do not get me started on the collard greens and cornbread.  Suffice it to say, deliciousness.  My boyfriend gave me some of his ribs and they were also an awesome option.  Overall, our server was fantastic, the food was great and the prices were reasonable.  All four people in our party were beyond pleased!",

Will never come back to this place again  cornbread was so dry sucked up all my saliva - okra nasty, collard greens had zero seasoning, fried chicken was bland...even the damn biscuit was dry.  The ONLY thing that was decent was the Mac and Cheese. Gumbo sucked cheap with the meats! If you want some REAL REAL GOOD Cajun food: Cajun Queen is your place!!! Anyway so we paid and left The Kings Kitchen and we are now here at Rock Bottom to eat...AGAIN...so pissed!",

    "text": "I am between Meh and A-ok. Mostly leaning towards Meh, but rounding up simply because I love the concept and was excited since we love Roosters and they are owned by the same people had high expectations.   Had made a reservation, but were still seated at an awkward table at the front of the restaurant where I had to actually change seats with my husband since there was a giant light that was shining directly down on my face. He said it didn't bother him since he is taller, but I think he may have just been trying to make me feel better.   We decided to start with the cheese plate which was tasty, but never comes with enough crostinis so I had to ask for some more, which is not a big deal except for the fact that within a minute of bringing them out, our entrees arrived. This is a big pet peeve of mine at a restaurant. I order an appetizer to enjoy before my meal arrives. I don't like to be interrupted halfway through with a big plate of food. Something always ends up getting pushed to the side and that feels like such a waste to me. (I know I could have sent it back and said we weren't ready yet, but our service was already iffy, at best, and didn't want to risk being served a cold entree since they were annoyed with me).   Both the hubs and I ordered the skillet chicken and found it to be pretty tasty, though I would have liked to see a little more seasoning in the skin. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part. I found it to be disappointing that we had to ask for the biscuit and cornbread that were ordered with our entrees and then equally disappointed with the quality of the biscuit when it arrived (though husband thought the corn bread was pretty tasty).   All in all, I left feeling a little disappointed and even though I think it is a great concept, don't think I will be heading back or recommending it to anyone any time soon.",

I was surprised about the religious sayings in the restaurant, my boyfriend told me it is normal in the south. We would definitely come again.",

Out of town guests? Don't tell them the fact that this is a non-profit giving a few great people a chance at learning a new skill in this upscale restaurant setting. Tell them as they enjoy their meal.   The bakery is fantastic. Take some home. Try to dessert. You'll be glad you did.",

Parking - Plenty of parking lots around the city.  Service - Friendly!  Food - For the most part, very good. 1.  Pimento Cheese and Toasted Bread - Love it!  Big portion to share. 2. Pork Chop - Avoid.  Dry and bland. 3. Shrimp and Grits - Very light and delicious.  However, the portion is a bit small. I walked away hungry. 4. Scallops - Cooked very well, flavorful and moist.  But again, small portions. 5. Banana Pudding - Very very good.  Made with real banana's, not that yellow store bought banana flavored pudding.",

    "text": "My best friend and I were headed uptown to see the Book of Mormon at the Belk Theater and decided we had just enough time to grab a quick dinner.  I used the Open Table app to get us a table for just as we would arrive at 7pm.  We were greeted and seated quickly.  The restaurant was fairly full so we were quite happy to have gotten a table.  Knowing the show was to start at 8pm, we ordered and bottle of wine, the Pimento Cheese appetizer and each got a cup of the Noble's Tomato Bisque.  Our waiter was so understanding of our tight dinner window; the wine was brought immediately and the food followed shortly thereafter.  The pimento cheese was some of the best I've had and was a perfect compliment to the tomato bisque, which was a lovely balance of tomato without the heaviness of cream.  Although our visit was quick, we thoroughly enjoyed and I look forward to another full meal at another time.",

If you are craving authentic southern food, you must eat here. I, however, am more of a modern southern cuisine girl so the food did not sing to me. The fact that my food also came out of order and sometimes 2 plates at the same time (nope, I am not kidding ... ) might have confused my palate a little bit. I thought the food was incredibly over-salted (and I consider salt a food group) - even my wedge salad was salted. Heavily.   I was pleasantly surprised when I blindly ordered a glass of Riesling (no mixed drinks here!) and was presented with a local NC wine. And, yes, it was excellent!   My husband is on a quest for the best banana pudding ever (is that even what it's called? you Southerners need to set me straight ... banana pudding, vanilla wafers, etc.) ... and he said that this definitely makes the top of his list.   Check out the King's Kitchen. Jim Noble is doing some amazing things over there. But maybe check it out mid-week or perhaps for lunch where the service might be a little bit less harried.",

Although the fried chicken looked fabulous, I needed something a little lighter. So I ordered the chicken salad which came out on a crusty, thick crescent roll; they called it a croissant but it is not the light French pastry you might anticipate. It was accompanied by shoestring fries sprinkled with what might have been pepper. My colleague's lunch was the panini which she enjoyed.    The place gets five stars for its commitment to the homeless and for its overall mission.  The place is clean and the service is also five star.  The food was good and very reasonably priced.   Bottom line: Go. Give back to the community and get a little something for your tummy while you're there.",
