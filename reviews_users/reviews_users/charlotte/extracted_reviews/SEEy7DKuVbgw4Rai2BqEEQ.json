    "text": "I heard such great things about Los Paisas that I had to give it a try.    It sits in the corner of the McMullen Creek Shopping Center and it could be easily missed.  I entered and despite being really busy, I was greeted immediately.    The service is what stood out here.  The servers realized I was new and went out of their way to let me try and empanada with the various sauces.  I wanted something authentic so not knowing it was the biggest thing on the menu, I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana.  The beef was good especially with the chimichurri sauce added.  The sausage was my favorite.  I didn't care for the pork crackling, the tortilla or the rice but I'm not a big rice eater (read my Asian reviews).  Everything else was wonderful.    But next time I don't think I'll order the largest plate on the menu.",

    "text": "Call this a very low, marginal four-star.  Which we could have half rating from Yelp!  Having traveled extensively in South America, one month in Colombia was an excellent experience and a better way to know the food, people and cultures of the country.  The Colombians have good reason to be proud of their country and keep asking, \"Where are the American tourists?\"  I remind them of the drug wars, which they are burying deep in their mental pasts and the conversations moves on.  My wife and I never found Colombian food to be anything special, but we were impressed with Los Paisas.  Los Paisas is how they refer to thenselves and their trademark, very traditional worker's meal is a paisa.  This is the full-court press of sausage, fried pork skin, rice, beans, fried plantain and more.  It is a feast and will last you for a day.  Try it at Los Paisas.  We were the only gringos in the place, so you know that the food is what the latinos like.  And with the servers all fluent in Spanish, Los Paisas is a comfortable place for those who do not speak English well.  Best news is that they have daily specials prices at just under $7.  Includes soup, beverage and a choice of three entrees.  An excellent way to shop through Colombian cuisine.  We had the grilled pork covered with white cream sauce,  Nice little salad with it and the lighter green plantain, which is not really green as is raw, but lighter fried.  The standard plantain is heavily fried, thicker and comes out a orange-yellow.  Wife had a salad with avacado and it was a very generous portion of both greens and avacado.  House dressing is a red wine vinaigrette made in-house.  I found it way too sweet for my taste, but my wife liked it.    Iced tea is very weak, more like tinted water.    Service was excellent.  They have skillfully used their limited space to put in a full bar and have room to dance.  Seating is available outside and is not crowded inside.  We will come back for another lunch special as we think Los Paisas has potential to be a full 4-star or a five.",

I had to sit at the bar because the place was so packed.  Amazing is a serious understatement to describe this dish. it was a lot of food I was so hungry I almost finished it all...I could have if I had not ordered the two Epanadas which were superb. The Colombiana had so many different textures & flavors ..tip make sure you mix the chimichuri sauce in with the white rice...& BOOYAW! When you combine the egg, rice n beans, steak, sweet plantains & avacado in one bite...DAMN makes you want to jump up an smack somebody.... this has to be the best South American restaurant in Charlotte... no wonder its in Balyntyne area....I will definitely be coming back here.",

If you're used to mexican food, this might at first appear similar, but it's different enough to be worth the visit.The first thing I noticed that was different was that instead of tortillas, they served plantains with every dish. The rest of the dishes might be familiar enough, so don't think this will be something crazy that you won't have a clue what it is, it's all recognizable.  Overall the place is very clean and the staff is friendly. It's popular, which is well deserved by the attention they put into their preparation of the food. The portions were a good size too.

Think of how many places you would drive that far out of your way to eat at.  You should eat here and see why it is worth the drive.  I always go here with my Colombian house guest who happens to be married to my uncle.  What I love about this place: 1) Meat/Res (especially beef/carne); 2) The hot soups; 3) The sausage (red, not the black so much); 4) Volume of food you get for your order; 5) The rose colored mayonnaise sauce.  My wife loves this place, heck everyone I take here loves this place.  This is not a big place, they will accommodate your group but there are only 20 or so tables.  The place is packed and half the time I come here I have to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated.  I come here with 4-7 people and it is usually the more than 4 people that lead to the longer wait times.  The staff are very friendly, speaking both Spanish and English.  Don't tell Wifey, but some very fit people come and eat here.",

Bandeja Paisa - the flagship dish - is huge, not too expensive, and yes, it puts you into a food coma.  Drink selection is great too, big old cup of concentrated exotic fruit juice mixed with water.  Staff usually can deal with spanish or english.  Service is very fast unless they are completely full.  Outside seating for overflow is nice.    Their fried yuca plate is really too small, I'd rather fry it at home at the price, but that's about the only negative I can find.  Stop in, order something, and enjoy yourself!",

Their specials come with a side salad, rice, plaintains, and a huge bowl of delicious veggie soup to complement the entree. The chicken was savory and awesomely seasoned, and every bite made me wish I lived closer to Pineville so I could become a regular.  Not much to say, everything was faultless! Great lunch specials, cheap prices, and really friendly, quick service. Convenient location too, even though it's hidden behind the Waffle House. Can't wait to come back for dinner someday and try their desserts. No doubt, this is my new favorite South American restaurant in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Just flat-out delicious cuisine!  This is based on 3 meals that I have thoroughly enjoyed during lunch hour. The pictures on Yelp really don't do justice to the wonderful flavors that one experiences with each bite. I know that this review is sounding a bit cheerleader-ish but this is exceptionally delicious food.   I hesitate to mention this but I believe that their menu is under priced. When I watch the food shows on cable TV I see dishes that take 15, 20, 36 hours to prepare. This is one of those places (I'm guessing). It seems that the secret to Los Paisas is that they serve up slow food instead of fast food and, wow, you can really taste the difference.  They have 3 lunch specials every day (plus the menu dishes) and the specials are different each day. Order with confidence. I don't think you'll get a mediocre dish no matter what it is, so throw a dart and enjoy a properly prepared plate.  One thing that I will order every time I go in, is the guacamole app served with plantain \"chips\". Try this, it will change your life.  I find it interesting that Colombian cuisine does not rely on spicy peppers for flavor. They don't use chili's at all in the food but if you do like it hot, there is a 3 variety container of different pepper sauces that is brought to your table. Another interesting twist is that all the servers are men. They are all very professional and attentive. It's not really a \"thing\" but it is a difference that I haven't come across too often.  Lastly, the portions are very generous. I come away from a meal at Los Paisas feeling like I have just had something from someone's family recipe book. It's a real treat to find a well run, consistently great restaurant!",

It was my go to dish at my favorite Columbian joint up in NYC.  This dish is enough to fee two people!! You get rice, beans, steak, sausage, pork belly, a fried egg, avocado, sweet plantains and a thick white tortilla. I can't begin to descried how delicious every single bite was. I almost didn't make it back to work as my food coma started to kick in.  The entire staff was extremely friendly and welcoming which made me feel more comfortable as I was probably the only non-Hispanic person there. I sat at the bar so I could watch a soccer game on tv. The owner/manager himself came out and spoke to me for a bit. He even checked back in a few times to make sure I was doing ok. Overall, I had a great experience and I will recommend this place to anyone looking for good Columbian food. I can't wait to go back.",

This dish has everything but the kitchen sink, chicharron  (pork cracklings - there is a reason \"Crack\" is in the name), steak, rice, beans, avocado, sweet plantain, chorizo (Colombian sausage), and a fried egg!  It tasted great and very authentic.  The chicharron was a little small but still tasted great.  The beans don't typically have too much flavor but these were well seasoned and tasted like homemade Colombian beans. On my way out I noticed they had breads (it's a bakery too).  I took some almojabanas (cheese bread), which were amazingly good, soft and warm...  Ac was broken but the food helped me troop past that!  Will definitely go back",

I got the Wednesday lunch special which starts out with a flavorful lentil soup which reminded me of my grandmothers, I would definitely go back just for that , next came the main course which was picadillo (steak with peas and corn ) and it was accompanied with rice , fried plantain and a side salad. That was lovely and so flavorful!! I also got an empanada which was nice and crisp the filling was very delicious. I also got an arepa with chorizo which was also a great dish, I got all this amazing food for only $13 . My only criticism for this business is the service, it could use some improvement  he took our order and only checked on us when we finished eating our meal but other than that the food is excellent and it has a great atmosphere !

We were greeted warmly when we arrived and our server was very pleasant.  I ordered the trout - it was so good! It has braised onions and mushrooms in a delicious and not heavy sauce. If you are a fish lover as I am, you won't be disappointed. It came with tostones (fried green plantains), but unfortunately they were hard and dry with little flavor- I was disappointed as I was looking forward to them. Rice and salad was part of the entree as well and both forgettable.  My friend had the pechuga de pollo (chicken breast) in a mustard sauce. Sounds strange but it worked. The chicken was tender and the sauce an interesting change from normal fare. Both entrees were large portions. There was just about something for anyone on the menu. Seriously, if the tostones hadn't been so bad this could have been a 5 star experience.  The ladies room was clean, and every person I saw friendly and welcoming. Casual attire.  I totally would recommend",

(Just never like beer except going to Germany, Belfast or UK) If it is not raining, this place is always jam packed. Most guests are from Colombia (my friend is) or South Americans. They need to do something for the floor if they really want to take care of customers who love to dance.  The floor is YUCK!  Even they have cleaned it up before the party time.

The food was tasty and top quality. we started off with Empanadas, which had good flavor and probably could have been plenty for two as a meal. But we didn't stop there... we also ordered a side of Yuca, which seemed a bit on the dry side, I don't believe it was an error on the cooking process but instead I don't believe the Yuca was quite ripe, even with the dryness they were great! I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana, which honestly is enough for two people. Everything on the plate was cooked perfectly and had such great flavor. I loved the sausage and crackling. Because of the amount of food on my plate, I didn't get a chance to try any other dishes, but there were no complaints from the table.  This is definitely a top notch restaurant, not the best of locations though (it is at a location that you need to be going there to see it, its located in a corner of a shopping complex that isn't thriving anymore).  Everything said, We will definitely be visiting again for more!",

    "text": "Initially we wanted to go to a different restaurant nearby that was closed. I saw Los Paisas and it was crowded, which is always a good indicator for good food. I am normally very picky with my food, but this restaurant was good. I loved their fresh juices. They are just $3 and are freshly prepared. I had a mango and passion fruit juice. Both juices were very refreshing, came in a large sized glass and were just wonderful. If you don't like it too sweet, make sure you mention not to put too much sugar in your juice.  Also, I looved their black sausage. It is a blood sausage. People usually don't try blood sausage, but I would highly recommend this sausage. I wasn't too impressed with the ox tail soup, but it was home style and I think many people would like it. It was potato based. The ox tail was excellent. I am just not too big on potato soups in summer. Also, for my taste, it was a little \"plain\", but it is a classic potato based ox tail soup.  They have also a very good starter. It is guacamole with fired bananas that are like ships. It may doesn't sound great, but it was very good. I enjoyed it.     Overall, it was good food. I wouldn't call this cuisine \"exciting\", but it was very good home-style food with large portions. If you are new to this cuisine, start with starters. Ask to share one portion of the soup. It comes with rice and salad and will get you full. We shared a soup, had 4 starters, paid about $35 and were happy and full. It was good.",

    "text": "I am reluctant to give only one star seeing all the 4-5 stars on Yelp for this place which was what brought me to Los Paisas in the first place. My husband, son and I went Sunday 2pm. The place was packed and we had a short wait. We were very excited to see the place packed translating to a good restaurant and seeing the food being served to other patrons looked delicious. Unfortunately, my $15.99 seafood bouillabaise was terrible because it had 2 small/medium size shrimps, 4 frozen (not fresh) mussels, 2 tiny pieces of fish, 2 small rings (size of nickel and dime) of calamari, 3 crab legs the length and width of my fingers that was fully intacted in the shell (with no means of cracking the legs open). It came in a deceiving big bowl only to have me fish around in the sauce for the seafood. Why do they even bother having this on the menu only to serve frozen mussels and teeny tiny seafood? My husband ordered a cup of coffee which was luke warm he says. He hailed the waiter over and the waiter did remedy this by getting my husband a hotter cup of coffee. I was also excited to try the crispy pork from my husband's plate only to find it really hard to chew. Way over cooked/fried. The place was packed with Colombians so I would think its authentic and good. Don't go by my 1 star and not try this place, just don't order the seafood bouillibaise. Or maybe they just want to serve to Colombians? I'm fine with that. Its too bad we didn't have a good experience cause we are the type that would patronize a restaurant every week if we love it. Other restaurants would be glad to take my money once a week I'm sure.",

I am kind of surprised at their somewhat high prices for some of the dishes (at least compared to the big city I come from). Also, I wish they had soup options throughout the ENTIRE day not just for lunch. Their tres leches dessert is to DIE FOR!!!!",

If you like a place where the managment treats you bad and you dont feel appreciate it it might be for you otherwise they are plenty more restaurants that really make you feel welcome in the area and colombian food as well, I understand now why the other two locations they had closed. Really bad service. That is the bottom line! By the way food is ok not the best, tip if you order empanadas tell them you do not want them to burned",

    "text": "After reading the numerous good reviews, I had to find out for myself. My wife and I drove out to the Mathew-Pineville area which is a 28 minute drive.   Once we arrived, the restaurant appeared to be busy and very chaotic. We made our way in and were not greet due to the busy nature of the restaurant. After a 5 to 8 min wait I had to ask if we could even get a seat. We finally got acknowledged and were told to wait for 10-15 mins. I believe this was the one big negatives that kept it from getting 5 star review. The hostess and everyone seemed to not want to acknowledge or ask if we needed help.   After finally getting in, we dive into the good stuff. The food was exceptional from the beginning to the end. Being Colombian, my standard were set pretty high. The appetizers empanadas and arenas con chicharrones were fresh. They were not greasy or stale. The empanadas picadillo had the perfect balance between spicy and flavorful.   Our entrees were no less than spectacular, my wife ordered chicken and mushrooms which he described as heavenly. The rice and plantains were cooked perfectly.  I ordered the bandeja tipica which is our traditional dish in Colombia. Again everything was prepared perfectly and the dish was not overwhelming in season or grease. This dish is probably one of the hardest to balance due to the huge amount of food and fat but this was done perfectly. The only thing that got over cooked was the chicharrones and it was missing the arepa.   After stuffing our faces we still made room to order flan which was great. Not much of a desert person myself but my wife loved it.   Our waiter was good and quick which helped a bit since our greet was terrible. The only suggestion to improve is in the greeting and make a investment in high chairs since ours did not work.",

I drank about 4 glasses of water and I never had to ask once for a re-fill. My food (app, soup, main dish) were all delivered in a timely spaced out manner.   2. Smaller but spacious restaurant dining side and bar side. Soft music and a soccer game was on.   3. Priced reasonably for the amount of food you get. ($1 empanadas)   4.  Delicious Colombian food! Homemade green sauce (aji sauce?) was given was soon as we ordered our food. And I think I used about half of the bottle. It was so good! The beef empanadas were large and so good topped with the green sauce. My boyfriend asked how many I wanted and I said one, so he ordered three (we share everything) and we ended up getting four, so....I ate two. I just couldn't stop!   5. Large portions: I ordered the daily special pork, rice, salad, and soup. My homemade chicken soup came in a large bowl and it was so fresh! The pork was grilled and seasoned. I love the rice, again topped with the green sauce! The salad was okay, it was tossed in dressing and seemed to be a pre-mixed blend.   I will return and tell my friends to come for some authentic Columbian food!",

Heaping amount of food that had been cooked to long back and was not edible. Rather than send back and cause a scene I left with others.

We started out with empanadas (meat patties), which were absolutely delectable! Then we ordered Milanesa de pollo (Breaded chicken), a Picada, and 2 bandeja Paisas. The Milanesa de pollo was so delicious and flavorful and the picada was excellent in every way. The bandeja paisas like always were a fan favorite at the end of the day. In the end, I absolutely recommend Los Paisas for the food, service, and fast ordering!",

Service is great, menu has a lot of good options and their price is more than fair. To start we always order the beef empanadas, they were crunch and flavorful. The best empanadas I ever had! As entree we both had the Bandeja tipica Colombiana that is rice, red sausage, egg, avocado, grilled beef, pork cracklings and plantains that I always switch to fried yucca. To drink I had guava juice that was really good too. You will be surprised to see how much food they serve. My husband and I barely could eat half of our plate.  The food was amazing!!! On the weekends they get busy but I've never seen a long line waiting for a table.  I have been to at least 4 Colombian restaurants in Charlotte but this one is so far the best!",

    "text": "Los Paisas is a great little Columbian restaurant in south Charlotte. They have great lunch specials Monday through Friday for $7.62! The lunch includes soup of the day, entree, side salad and sweet plantains. They Have three lunch specials that change every day. There is always a beef dish, a chicken dish and a pork dish to choose from. Additionally, they understand that people usually don't have much time for lunch so the food comes out promptly! All of the food that I have had from them has been fantastic! The empanadas are small and very tasty with the perfect amount of crunch! If it's your first time for dinner I recommend the Bandeja tipica Columbiana. It is a sampler platter of some of the most popular Columbian dishes. It has grilled beef, red sausage, egg, pork crackling, rice, beans, avocado and sweet plantains. It comes with white corn tortillas as well. Warning: it is a huge amount of food and you're likely to have leftovers! Service has always been fast, friendly and efficient. This is an absolute hidden gem in South Charlotte!",

The staff is friendly and they give you this tasty slightly spiced green sauce when you sit down. It's for empanadas, so you have to get one. (heck they're $1!!) we got that amazing combination dish you see pics of all over here, and yes it's just like that. Each part is so fresh authentic and tasty.  I got the Bistec encebollado and I will definitely get it again. Picture beautiful marinated flank steak topped with tomatoes, onions, peppers and in a yummy tomato sauce that goes fantastic with the rice. Topped with a fried egg that only compliments it. It also comes with fried plantains as a great bonus. Yes, will come back and bring friends!!",

I told him I needed to go somewhere with flavor and seasoning and he brought me to Los Paisas. He'd gone with a friend and said it was good food. When we got there the place was packed with what looked like mostly Colombians, (forgive me if I'm wrong) and to me that's always a good sign. If the people who know the food are eating it, score! The wait was about 15-20 minutes and then we were seated. We got waters, two complimentary empanadas with a green sauce that was absolutely delectable, hubby got the steak encebelloda (sp?) and I got the Colombiana plate!  The chicharron was my favorite but everything on the plate was delightful! Rice, beans, plantain, steak, sausage, egg, tortilla, the sauce! Yum! Yum! Yum! We saw another table order a refreshing mango drink and we got one too. It was very nice but just not cold enough so we brought it home along with our leftovers. And the service was prompt and polite. Not super friendly but in no way rude. Just more on the efficient side with no personal engagement from the waitstaff. If they add that in, it'll be even better. And the total cost of our meal with tax and before tipping was $34 and change. For the portions and the goodness, it's a great price! See my pics! Go. Eat. Drink. Enjoy.  That is all!",

This could be a good place for lunch with family/friends or coworkers - also appropriate for a date. There are tons of options on the menu, even for vegetarians/pescatarians.   The drinks/smoothies/juices are delicious. Also, pretty much everything on the appetizer list is really good. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed with the entrees. I tried the trout in lemon/mushroom sauce. It was just OK. The chicken was also, just OK. Nothing to write home about. The service was surprisingly good, our waiter was great. Prices are also not bad, for the amount of food you get. Los Paisas is a good option to try some Colombian cuisine, but they just need a little bit of help in the kitchen - to really blow it out the park.   Nevertheless, que viva Colombia :)",

I ordered the white rice, beans, and chicken breast with mushrooms and maduros (sweet plantains).  It was absolutely delicious.

We have been to some really good ones, but Los Paisas is the bar. We have been to 4 Columbian restaurants specifically and none of them really compare.   The flavor, the value, the service, it's all there. I always get the Bandeja Tipica Columbiana. It has the best bang for the buck for me. It's so much food, I always have enough for another meal later. It comes with grilled beef, beans, sausage (which is the best I've had), pork crackling, rice, egg, plantains (which I swap for Yuca), avocado and white corn tortilla. Even just saying all of that is a mouth full.  The first thing we do when we are seated is order some beef empanadas. You'd think that if you've had empanadas before then you already know what to expect, but that's far from the truth. I've had my fair share of empanadas in my life and I can't even compare them, as they are in a league of their own.   Bring your appetite, bring your wallet and bring a blanket (for the nap after, since you'll be in a food coma).",

Part of the combo plate was beans but the presentation was not appealing; the beans were watery which made some of the water spill over on the side of the plate and on some of the meat.  We also had coffee which was nice a rich dark roast. Our waiter was great at making suggestions and we tried pretty much everything he suggested lol  We had 2 margaritas which were awesome, not too sweet, just like I like it!

There was a short wait (they said it would be 15 minutes, but it was more like 6 or 7), and we were seated in the back area. For some reason, the windows were all fogged up, and it was super humid inside. Odd.  For dinner, I went with the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana (the typical Colombian platter) since I figured that would be the best representation of the food and the restaurant. The red sausage was good, and so were the plantains (they're pretty hard to mess up), but the pork cracklings were hard to eat and didn't have much flavor... neither did the beans or rice. The fella got the Pechuga en Champinones - chicken in mushroom sauce with rice, beans, and plantains. I don't like mushrooms, but his definitely won in the flavor department. We got a tres leches cake for dessert, which was the second best thing I ate behind the chicken.  Service was good, but not great; however, they were slammed. I wasn't wowed, and I won't be in a hurry to go back, but it was... fine.",

    "text": "On the penultimate eve of my final day in Charlotte (I'm moving to NYC), I do believe that I just had one of the best meals of my life.   Los Paisas is a Colombian restaurant that serves amazing food, has great prices, and the best service.  First up, the margarita was huge and strong! The empanadas that they give you a la nachos and salsa at a Mexican restaurant, had so much flavor! If I had known, I would've ordered them as a full appetizer.  Boy were they amazing!  For the entree, I had the Bandejas Tipica Colombiana, which is the combo plater that has the works: fatty deep-fried pork, grilled steak, rice and beans, fried egg, avocado, sausage. The steak was a particular flavor standout. I had the identical dish at Pio Pio a few weeks ago, but the one here was a hundred times better.  Los Paisas also gives you 3 dipping sauces to accompany your meal.  All 3 are green and are equally delicious, though the one with olive oil was my favorite.  The service was authentically friendly and professional.  Such warm people!  I absolutely love this place, and am disappointed I only discovered it now.  This place rocks!!  (Update: I came back the following day for lunch, because the food was so good.  For lunch, I had a mojito, and chicken with mustard mushroom cream sauce.  It was really good, as it came with rice and plantains (requested).  I love this restaurant!)",

They had a live band the night I went. Loved it. The place is on the small side and it was for sure a full house! Crowded near the door.   We had the meat empanadas to start ! Straight perfection. Perfectly crispy! Gone in two seconds.   I had a guanabana shake ....again perfect my little sister gave me a sip of her mango shake you guessed it perfect!   I had the Columbian platter has tons of stuff rice, beans, meat, sausage, plantains, a fried egg, fresh chicharones ( I think it's pork skin) & an arepa. Everything was as expected wonderful. There's a hot sauce I had that was awesome too. It's one of the three they have. I didn't look at the other two so I can't explain, but it was so good even took some home.   My son wanted tostones (fried green plantains) he topped them with salsa roja (red sauce) red sauces is something you need to experience it's just so amazing!   This place was awesome I will for sure be going back.",

The place was packed with Latins having lunch at their  usual (Latin) time.   Service was fantastic, in spite of hustle and bustle the help made sure I got my food asap when I told them I had to go.    I ordered the Picada, way too much food and definitely heavy but very tasty. I loved the roasted casava, plantains etc. The \"red sausage\" (chorizo!) very good tasting but compared to the Argentine version it's much drier and tougher. The \"black sausage\" ( morcilla or blood pudding) has rice in it, again drier and nowhere as rich flavored as the Argentine version, but it's a Colombian restaurant so that's not a completely fair comparison. Also people who are not used to it would probably prefer the milder Colombian black sausage. I had to run and didn't have time to finish my lunch, but I'd definitely return if I'm in that area. I looked at what other people were having and all of it looked very appetizing , huge portions too. Don't go there if you're on a diet!",

My stepdad got the cocktail de camarones and was very disappointed.  It was like a like luke-warm bloodymary mix with tasteless shrimp.  I am a big fan of south American food, Cuban food, and anything worldy, so I'm fine with eating a fish w/ a head on the plate.  Everything there besides the table salsas was rather bland.

For $7.50 (with tax) you get a soup, drink and choice of daily special. All specials come with rice, salad and fried plantain.  I ordered the steak in black sauce. Absolutely fantastic. Flank steak cooked just right and smothered in a tasty black sauce. The salad was fresh and topped with pickled beets, which I adore. The dressing was akin to a ranch but a bit sweeter. The rice was not overcooked and the fried plantain was a great compliment. My co-workers ordered the pork loin with mushroom sauce and the baked chicken, both stated they would order their dishes again!  I can see this easily becoming a regular lunch stop.  Service with a smile, lick your plate clean food and respectable prices, there is no reason this place can't receive anything but a 5 star rating from me.  Try this place for lunch! Fabulous!

This place definitely has DC beat on ambiance- it's a cute restaurant and nicely decorated, plus they also have a nice little outdoor eating area and a couple of TVs (tuned to soccer).  Started with an empanada and pan de bono each- both awesome! Their pan de bono is actually the best I've ever had (but if you want to try them or any of the other baked goods, you might want to go for lunch- they do all their baking in the morning, and when it's gone it's gone!). Then we moved on to the paradilla (a large platter of grilled meats, with fried onions and peppers) which came with fried plantains and rice on the side. Not the best I've had, but it was pretty good- and at $20ish for two people it isn't a bad deal.  I'll definitely be going back, as there are some other things on their menu I can't wait to try. One item my husband was excited to see is sancocho, which they don't serve at DC.",

    "text": "Tried Los Paisas this weekend - we were seated quickly and our waitress came right over. They had $3.99 Mojitos and Margaritas, so we tried both. They were good - and good-sized! It is in a strip mall, but the inside is clean and not cluttered. Lots of tables that aren't on top of each other.   We ordered the GIANT combination plate (Paradilla) - it had grilled chicken, steak, pork, 2 kinds of sausage, plantains and a large side of white rice. There were 3 kinds of sauce on the table, I liked the bright green one best and used it on all the meats - tasted fresh and a little spicy. The combo was $23, so a really good deal for the massive amount of food. We didn't take leftovers but you could easily make 2 meals out of it.  It was a fun experience - not your run of the mill restaurant. They even had live music! Check it out if you want a getaway from your average night out!",

    "text": "From the looks of it, Los Paisas may not seem like much, but once inside, strap yourself in, because you're going to treat yourself to one of the best culinary rides in Charlotte. As with any \"comida tipica\" (meaning \"authentic\"), you're going to get a lot of food. No, I mean A LOT OF FOOD. Come with an empty stomach. You won't be sorry.   For those of us who crave authentic, there's plenty to choose from. For those of you who might be a bit apprehensive, never fear, there's also plenty to choose from to satisfy your palates. Great menu for kids, too.   I grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. Little Bogota. So I ate a lot of \"comida tipica colombiana\" back in the day. Los Paisas brought me back to my days running around on 82nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. Simply put, there's authentic, and there's Los Paisas. Their dedication to authenticity is absolutely admirable, and we as the consumer will always benefit from this.",

Soup, which which was part of the meal was \"vegetable\" today & was cold & basically chicken broth w/veg all.  I ate very little  of my food, including the soup.  Yet I was charged for the soup & the beverage, both of which were to have been included in my meal.  Not sure I'll go back...for the $$ I spent, I could have gone to Subway next door...at least I would have been full for the same amount of $$.",

    "text": "Glad I finally decided to try Colombian cuisine. As you can see from the pictures, they give you a lot, so recommended you come hungry. The skirt steak was quite generous as well as the fried plantains. Food quality was terrific and a great value. I also got a smoothie (dairy-based) which was served in a very tall glass - can't remember the name of the fruit but it was awesome. For those looking for something different and affordable, I recommend Los Paisas and look forward to returning to try some of their seafood.",

    "text": "Looks like I am one of the only ones who wasn't very impressed. Maybe I need to go back again and get something different?  We went for lunch and I was pretty excited after reading the reviews. The inside is clean and quaint. It is located in a shopping center (a little tough to find) but it is tucked in to the right of Staples.  We split two beef empanadas and the Bandeja Paisa which includes a mixture of egg, steak, sausage, an avocado cut in half, a sweet plantain, beans and rice. I really enjoyed the plantain but the rest was lacking a bit of flavor and wasn't very hot temperature-wise. I liked the steak once I added some of the side sauces to them but my chimichuri-loving husband said he thought it tasted jarred to him.   Most dishes minus the lunch specials (4 which change daily) were about $12 for lunch. That is a little steep for me , the dishes are definitely shareable which is nice but it limited us to ordering what the other person would want too. For the price I just didn't feel like the meal lived up to some other $12 lunches I have enjoyed.",

    "text": "Los Paisas has stolen my little Colombian food loving soul. I am crazy about plantains and yucca and LP carved a nice place in my heart! Finally made it in for lunch after hearing many good things from my wife and other friends.   The inside is quaint and houses a small bar, a handful of tables and a few TV's. Not over the top with decoration. Just simple and direct.   The staff was zipping around the dining area with multiple plates in hand. A wonderful Colombian culinary ballet was happening around us as we anticipated the arrival of our lunch.   We started with the Tostones con Queso. Green plantains with queso fresco. Only 3-4 on the plate, but perfect for two to share. These things are topped generously with fresh, melted cheese. Chewy plantains and melted cheese? Might as well be a bullseye.   I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana. A menagerie of flavors, textures and traditional Colombian dishes. The pork cracklin' was by far the most interesting item on the plate. Fried pork skin. It's like a high-five in your mouth. Like a chewy pork rind but succulent. It's a mammoth-sized portion. I'd recommend trying a bit. Eating the entire portion would be a bit much. The steak, egg and sausage were all fantastic.   Here's the kicker. The herb mixes they bring to the table are the golden goose, the cheery on top, the KO punch and the holy grail rolled into one. Spices and herbs, olive oils that complement every dish rather well. Mixing each one in with the rice and beans....something I crave daily. Can't wait to come back in just for these.   Lastly, the agua frescas are immaculate. We tried the pina (pineapple) and loved it. Served in a tall glass with many fresh chunks of pineapple afloat. Loved every sip/gulp.   This is definitely one of our go-to's in Crown Town! Love you, Los Paisas!",

We started with Empanadas! Nice size and they actually had meat in them! Score! We had Bandejas Paisas, Sobre Barriga Criolla...they were all winners! We all fell into a food coma on our drive home! Will fore sure be back!",
