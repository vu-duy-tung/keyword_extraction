Found myself disappointed in the amount of food on the tacos this time around. Don't get me wrong, they're delicious but I would like a little more bang for my buck. I ordered the Mac and cheese for my side and it lacked flavor and was oily enough for me to pour it out before I consumed it. Service was awesome. Our server Alyssa handled herself very well for it being the last night of restaurant week. The vibe of the whole place is really nice. I love all of the charm. I'll be back, probably regularly, but won't be getting the Mac and cheese again.",

They have big tv's over the interior bar and tv's surrounding the patio. This is definitely a great spot to catch a game or grab drinks with the crew.

    "text": "Went on the first night of restaurant week. Fiance and I went to this establishment for the first time and overall we were satisfied with the food.  We placed our order and the server asked for everything at once since it was restaurant week.  It took a little longer than expected for our apps to come out but not an abnormally long period of time.    Philly egg rolls were good and so were the lobster corn dogs.  They were still a little warm but on the verge of being cold, but tasty nonetheless.  Within two minutes of our appetizers arriving the entrees showed up...  That was a little frustrating since we had just been brought our appetizers.  Entrees were good!  She had the pasta and thought it was a little spicy for her taste, but that is just personal preference.  I had the pork chops and enjoyed them.  The brussel sprouts were 'swimming' in the sauce that they were served with which I didn't like but they were flavorful. Dessert is were they lost us though.  Fiance ordered the cookie skillet and it was two rock hard cookies in a skillet that she couldn't eat.  I guess we could have asked for clarification prior to ordering but it was not what she was expecting.  I had the lava/molten cake and it was just a solid piece of cake with some ice cream. We think this place has potential and will consider coming back in the future, but not during restaurant week.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this restaurant. First, the good: -Fun, lively atmosphere with several big TVs make it a good place to watch a game -Good draft beer prices. $4 craft beer of the month, $3.50 Yuengling, $3.25 Miller Lite, etc.  But unfortunately, there was a significant amount of bad: -I asked if the veggie burger patty was homemade and the waitress said yeah so I ordered it but it was clearly a Morningstar frozen patty. When I showed her, she never apologized or said sorry. She just asked if I wanted something else. I ordered the nachos. -The nachos came out without black beans. When I told the waitress, again no apology or sorry. Just a I'll bring you a side bowl of black beans. The side bowl came out only half filled but I poured them over the nachos and began to eat. Overall, pretty tasty but what ruined them were the tortilla chips they use. Absolutely horrible because some of them tasted burnt like maybe they fry the chips themselves but over fried them. Yuck, so I only got through half the nachos before I gave up.  The waitress finally apologized for the veggie burger fiasco when she dropped off the bill, saying that apparently they used to make homemade veggie patties but switched to frozen because their homemade ones weren't sticking together. Still annoyed I was given wrong information prior to ordering because had I not said anything, it's almost as if they're passing off frozen patties as homemade. If they're not even using homemade veggie patties, it makes me wonder how much of their menu is just frozen stuff. I don't want to pay $10-$12 for food I can just warm up at home myself.",

This last time we went, there was a 20 minute wait despite the numerous tables open. I understand that people make reservations so we gladly waited. 20 minutes later our table was ready and we were told we would be seated upstairs. Once we got upstairs it was a completely different atmosphere with four tables, odd lighting, and music playing from a speaker in the corner. It was like we were getting shoved off into some unfinished part of the restaurant where they put people when they were too busy. On top of that we waited for 13 minutes to even have our waitress come greet us, even when the manager went in and out of the upstairs three times. After the 13 minutes we were done waiting and left. Don't expect anything close to the same experience if they hide you away upstairs.",

Again wants to bash the consumer and is more worried about the review than the customer experience.    Jason, I'd like to start off by thoroughly apologizing once again for your evening at Caswell. I understand that it was a bad experience and not what you had in mind for a family's night out. However, restaurant experience aside, I take personal issue with a lot of what you rushed home to Concord to put on the internet. Your server absolutely cared, as did I. You mistake not caring with being overwhelmed. If I didn't spend any time trying to make it right then how do I know that you recommend going to Twin Peaks for the games or Union St. to eat a good meal? I said we'd do our best to make your night go up from a poor start...and the way you inhaled your steak there's no doubt in my mind that it did. See guys like yourself ARE the problem with yelp. Cat has your tongue at the table but go home and pound the keyboard. At least you know your strengths. We had a rough go at it tonight but I assure we will learn from it and be better for it. Maybe I can offer you the same opportunity...you see, we operate restaurants to support our families and make a living. Little proof from tonight, but actually are pretty damned good at it too. There's not a yelp for me to come cherry pick and post your worst day at the office online and even if there was I'd probably opt to shake your hand and tell you you'll do better next time B/c shotgun reviews like yours actually affect people livelihood. But hey, all men aren't created equal... that's just how the cookie crumbles, sir. Take care, Jason G.",

The food was really good and the beer selection was abundant. I got the chipotle and garlic wings and was not disappointed. I think the chipotle wings were the best of the two.

Not sure if the review will be worth it because their restaurant week menu had items that was not on the regular menu. They had a Game of Thrones Game Night going on so we couldn't join. The calamari was good, could've been a little crispier. The cheesesteak egg rolls were BOMB, the red sauce that tasted like sweet and sour sauce was interesting with cheesesteak BUT TRY IT lol. The main dishes, pasta and chicken Marsala, were both VERY tasty! The cookie skillet and cheesecake were BOMB, and I'm not really a sweets person! We did notice that the manager or whoever he was pull the waiter aside (might wanna take these convos out of the dining area, people can see you) like he was was rushing our waiter to get the tables in our area out the way it seemed. So with that we felt rushed, there's nothing wrong with that but we weren't even there that long. Normally for restaurant week your full order is taken but our waiter told us \"leave the menu and just let me know what you want next\" after the sidebar convo with the manager that's when we felt rushed! Oh well. Besides that everything there was good and they had my favorite beer Juicy Jay so I was happy. If patrons are buying off the main menu, don't rush them.",

    "text": "Went to visit Caswell Station, the first new restaurant/bar in the neighborhood since several closed down over the last year or so. I think it was soft opening, so perhaps they can work out some of the issues we encountered on this first visit.   It was Sunday Brunch and when we walked in, we were quickly acknowledged (great!). We were at first directed to sit anywhere, but then another server told us she'd take us to a table. There was some clear confusion between the two. We chose to sit at a booth. Unfortunately once we were seated at a booth, we realized how uncomfortable they are. There was about two inches between us and the table, which couldn't move because of the size of the table base.   We ordered the French toast with bacon and an avocado bacon sandwich with hash browns. The sandwich, which besides the avocado and bacon, had tomato and flavored cream cheese, was very good aside from a little too much cream cheese. The French toast looked nice and was topped with strawberries and whipped cream. Sadly the entire inside was undercooked and fell apart after putting the fork into it.   The service overall was very lackluster. Our server was very hard to find and seemed to have a chip on her shoulder that AM. We had to flag down a different waitress, who was much more obliging, to let them know about the soggy toast.   They removed the item from the bill, and the manager was very nice about it. Our waitress only came back by after the manager stopped over and crassly said something about the toast that indicated she didn't know about our issue, even though she should have since she was our server. She also snapped when I asked for more coffee that she was getting it, even though it took a while to come back by with the pot.   On our way out, we were nicely thanked by two servers sitting at the front, but one was eating a yogurt. Another pet peeve was that the ketchup asked for with the hash browns was served in a plastic to-go container, rather than a bottle or ramekin.   Don't think we'd run back here anytime soon, even though it's within walking distance and they did a nice job remodeling from when it was Kennedy's.",

Ideally, more vegetarian options would be great, but totally understandable for a more laid-back burger-type joint. Very reasonably priced and a delicious meal. The manager was very accommodating and let us hang out for another round after it was slowing down and the bar was about to close. We will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Pretty fond of this place. During a 3-month-long group search for good chicken wings in Clt, we found Caswells and we never left. We eat there about 2 times a week now. Wing Rating on flavor, variety, and not being tough, dry or burnt they win across the board=5 stars.  SOCIAL FRIENDLY RATING 4 STARS. They have Tues bingo and Thurs trivia, lots of TV's, and Karaoke. Kid friendly, Large outside patio with TV's, games, large fans for hot weather and heaters for chilly weather. Lots of seating for large or small groups and a private room upstairs. On-Lot parking is a premium and a little tight but $3 parking is right across the street. We always rate the girls restroom B/C it's important. They had a sauna-type heating issue for a while, which has been fixed, as well as the doors on both stalls not closing, which have also been fixed. Quick, hot water and soap for clean hands and decent TP. Clean and well-staffed = 5 stars. The only reason I put 4 and not 5 stars under Social Friendly is because of the STOOLS. Instruments of torture. SO uncomfortable. Many a night my friends and I left and went to another establishment or just cut our night short B/C our asses hurt. Perhaps the square stools with the round-corners made of red, white or silver metal were a deal but they do not fit everyone. Just a handful of one other variety of seat with--IDK, a little more space in the seat or a different shape or SOMETHING, would keep us there longer for sure. Good marketing to keep people there longer with something as simple as a comfortable stool.  FOOD & BEV RATING 5 STARS. There are only a few things I have not tried here but IMO this is above average bar food. It seems to have gotten even better in the past 2 months. There are some pretty creative selections on the menu and something for everyone. Great food specials including nights when kids eat FREE. The salads are always fresh, wonderful avocados and they even have a pretty good Brussel Sprout appetizer, although not really \"crispy\". All the burgers and main plates I've had (almost all of 'em) are well above average. You must try the Flat Breads. They are Excellent. Working my way through the Main Plates. Love the MeatLoaf, Pork Chops and Elizabeth Pasta. Prices are very reasonable for what you get and they have a great selection of alcoholic bevs. and some unreal specials. Kids menu is pretty good. They have food specials almost every day of the week and they even get points for presentation. The only thing I've had that was not good IMO were the CheeseSteak egg rolls. Not much cheesesteak flavor and not much egg roll flavor or crunch.   SERVICE AND STAFF RATING 5 STARS. Every single person who has waited on us in the past 6 months has been very friendly, personable and attentive. They really listen and pay attention to anticipate your needs so you're not desperately trying to flag down your server for more coke, etc. They are very patient when we get rowdy and I have seen particular attention and patience given to pets and special needs kids. Clean utensils, plates, tables and chairs. Occasionally the menus need to be wiped off and I have a pet peeve about not getting a cocktail napkin with a drink to wipe my fingers after squeezing the lemon or lime. I hate using my big dinner napkin for that.  Really like this place despite the uncomfortable stools. Looking forward to trying the Surf & Turf Fajitas, the Fried Crispy Pickles and the Caswell & Veggie Burgers.",

I only stopped in for a glass of wine late so I could look at the menu and see what it was like inside. Basically it still a sports bar type place. The difference is in the menu (some interesting appetizers, flat breads, sandwiches and main dishes) plus the red blend I ordered was good for the price. I will go back ASAP to have dinner and will update my review then.  Big positive: they give 10% off food to hospital employees. Yay! somewhere else to walk to.",

I've been here 12-15 times since it became Caswell Station, but it's already exhibiting the same issues that plagued Kennedy's in its final moments--a complete lack of interest in customer experience.   I am literally sitting here, right now. We made reservations online earlier today in advance of the Panthers game--then called to confirm. They were confirmed. Upon arrival, we were told that they weren't supposed to have reservations for Panthers games, and had lost any record of it. \"Luckily,\" we were able to squeeze five grown men around a (small) 4-person table.   Then we get to service--I don't know of it is our particular server, or whether it's management issues, but wow. She comes by every 30-40 minutes, at best. We are drinking cheap beers on a guys' night, that's not sufficient. We raised the issue with the hostess and the waitress, yet it continues. We just now started ordering from the bar.   And then, of course, they see the need to pay for an awful DJ to blare crappy music during commercials. Here's an idea, get rid of that guy, and pay someone extra to serve food and beer.   Just a terrible, terrible experience. It could be so much better, if they even pretended to care.  [Edit:  my previous 2-Star review was a bit harsh. As mentioned, I've been here more than a dozen times. Most of those times involve sitting at the bar--the bartenders are very good. So I'm bumping it to a 3, based on that. At the same time, the above review is completely True).",

It was all very tasty.  Unfortunately, there were a few things that were out of whack.  My companion wanted a glass of one of the wines on the menu.  That wine was not available.   Secondly, their towel dispenser in the restroom was broken and they just had a roll of towels that their patrons had to tear off on their own.   Finally, the noise level was annoying to us as we were trying to have a good discussion.   They have only been open for a few weeks and I am sure they will get better and better.   Based on the quality of the food, I would return.  I just need to take someone whose words I don't need to hear and I can already think of a few people . . .",

Following our meal, we both mentioned that we would absolutely come back in the near future! The staff was friendly, the prices were reasonable and the food tasted excellent! I would definitely recommend trying it. With the numerous big screen TVs and casual atmosphere, it's perfect for catching a game or just a casual evening.

It concerned me when I walked in on a Saturday night and they didn't seem very busy and the parking lot was basically empty. We were there at 7:30 so I gave it the benefit of the doubt that we were just eating later. After having dinner there, I understand why it wasn't busy. I had the French onion soup and the bread felt and tasted like a BRICK. It wasn't soft and soggy at all like it's supposed to be. I also ordered a shrimp taco which was decent but I've had better. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken flatbread which he said the hot sauce was REALLY HOT. Our food all came out at weird times but it was REALLY QUICK! Like oddly quick how soon our food came out.",

First the actual building is kind of cute since it's a big old house. We walked in to a large clean bar and restaurant with some fun style and tons of tvs. Great spot to watch a game I'd imagine, will have to come back for that. Our server was super friendly, attentive, and lovely. We ordered the cheesesteak egg rolls and Brussels to start. Love the egg rolls, cheese and beef deep fried with a tangy dipping sauce, what's not to love. The Brussels were a super large portion and very tasty but the texture wasn't my favorite, that's just personal preference. I ordered the neighborhood grilled cheese, so good, totally worth the clogged arteries. My bf had the burger which he said was good but not great. I'll definitely go back for some better than your basic bar food.",

First, the waiter refused to substitute an item (even when I offered to pay a surcharge on the new item) because of my dietary restrictions. Only after talking to another person, was I able to get the item substituted.   Second, the waiter was inattentive and, after numerous requests, members of my party had to go into the bar to get refills, waters, etc. Two members of my party were overlooked for ordering food and then when they said, a few minutes later, that they needed to order, the waiter was short and said something about how it was their fault they didn't order.   Third, food was late for multiple members of our party - one person actually had to ask where his food was after everyone else had received their food half an hour earlier.   Having worked in the service industry myself, I'm willing to overlook a lot. I am not willing to overlook complete ineptness in service by our server - Anthony. I will never return.",

Food is okay and just what you would expect from a bar.  Not a place that I would say is great for date night but awesome to watch a game.  I had the 7th street salad and it was delicious! A little small for the price so you might want to snack on an appetizer.  While I'm at it.... pick your cheat day and DO order their cheese steak egg rolls!  The Caswell burger is great too.  It's a big sandwich so you might want to share with a friend.  Lastly, I've also had the quesadilla. Nothing to write home about.  What I expected.  It's the same layout as Kennedy's but with fresh paint.  Looks like they've added a little outdoor area to play games such as corn hole.",

Seriously, great food every time and it doesn't disappoint.  CONS What is going on with the a/c unit? I have been this summer and it has been hot as balls inside. Like literally sweating as I am sitting there. I know it is an old building, but get it together mgt. I went another time and sat at the booths along where the window is and the a/c was blowing straight down on me. It was so cold I had to move onto his side of the booth. This is the booth that is by the window, but closest to the bathroom.   The high top table chairs- these are so uncomfortable. The metal digs into my bum, and my bum is average size!

    "text": "The Lady and I had a totally decent experience here, but we recognize it was also Monday night at 8pm when we arrived. Service was still a tad on the slow side, so it does worry me that the rest of the reviews are totally correct when it comes to the staff being the biggest problem of Caswell.  There *is* parking behind Caswell station, and that's a good thing too because there's no other parking elsewhere in the area. I think I might've seen a sign about overflow parking as well, but I didn't get a good idea where that was located.  The actually building itself kind of reminds me of Angry Ales in Montford, but more house-like. It's dim with TONS of TVs, but it was a nice night out so The Lady and I sat outside (again, plenty of TVs to watch games!) on the main patio. There's also a lower patio with astroturf where you can sit.   We both ordered cocktails - I got the Caswell Mule (sweet but a good flavor) and The Lady ordered some type of spritz that she liked a lot. At that point, we hadn't read any reviews, so we ordered an appetizer of the Crispy Asian Brussel Sprouts, because that sounds good, right? Nah. It's not crispy at all, and the sauce is weird and can get a little mushy. So, skip on that. For our entree, I saw that they had a Monday night special of $.75/wing so I went in on 12 wings, half with the Chipotle sauce and half with a honey hot. They came out fresh and the sauces were good, with blue cheese, carrots, and celery (just like every good wing plate should have). Props to them on doing wings better than average here!  I think I would come back to Caswell with a group without question because I didn't have a bad experience, but there wasn't anything standout that makes me really want to rave about them or come back. I won't really remember this place in T-1 week.",

    "text": "Interesting little place to try out. It's a two story house/ restaurant with an outdoor area for seating also. We came on a Saturday evening, the weekend before Halloween. They had a Halloween costume contest, and I will say the guy on stilts (assuming he's an employee) was pretty awesome!   We were seated right away, the only seating available was outside, and my only complaint was there was not enough heating lamps on the deck (2) so it was a bit chilly. But on the plus side we were surrounded by football games on every screen and we were not inside where it was very loud. Oh and the lighting ambiance was pretty nice also.  The food was AWESOME! We ordered their nachos for an appetizer, and those were smothered in queso and other yummy nacho goodness.  I ordered the Hawaiian burger, which was full of spice and flavor. It had grilled pineapple, jalapeno smoked bacon, and a mango jalapeno sauce. That was probably one of the best burgers I have had in a while. Different and good!   Overall I would come back and give this place another try next time I am in town. This seems like a place locals love and enjoy. Which is a plus to me!",

Of course they have the usual Sunday mimosa special for $2 and a double for $4. It was delicious, I hope one could never mess up a mimosa.   They have outdoor TVs for football and sports, which is nice. The waitress was friendly. She was personable and carried a nice conversation. Recommended for Sunday Funday fun.",

I had the Mexican burger and it was good, and the tater tots were warm and crispy.   My friend got the chicken and avocado wrap and said it was too much avocado, but I am not sure how that's possible. Ha.   Another friend got the dip trip and commented the pimento cheese was a bit runny, but honestly I was inhaling my food and didn't notice hers. Ha!  On another note, the women's restroom is special. One stall the door doesn't close and the handle to the door out is like turned the wrong way.   Tight parking entrance, so pray that no one is exiting when you are entering or vice versa.",

The first time I was here my fiance and I sat outside and ordered burgers and wings to split. They were having a special. Both were pretty good and reasonably priced. It was a nice day out and there were a lot of people outside on the patio. It looked like a nice place to come and have a drink and relax. I'll have to come back for that.   The second time I was here was for their anniversary celebration. There were great drink specials and a DJ. The DJ seemed a little out of place - like they were trying too hard to have people dance when most people were just hanging around the bar or outside.",

    "text": "My husband and I resolved that this is a good place to go to drink, but NOT a good place for food.  We went there for a late lunch one Sunday. The place was not busy so we were seated right away at a nice breezy table and the waitress immediately brought a water bowl out for our pooch, which was very nice. The service throughout our visit was very accommodating (which is the only reason this is a 3-star review not a 2-star one). However, we were incredibly unimpressed by the food.  We specifically asked about the Crispy Asian Glazed Brussels Sprouts appetizer, and the waitress raved about them. So we ordered them, but wish we had sent them back as soon as they got to the table. They were NOT crispy. In fact they were mushy and gross. I've had better brussels sprouts out of my own freezer. They were also overly sauced. Definitely not worth the $8 price tag.  We also each ordered the Strawberry Salad and both added Shrimp as a protein. The salad was fine, nothing to rave about, but was a bit small for an entree salad. $16 for a salad with shrimp is within the range I'd expect to pay, but it simply wasn't very delicious.   After tax and tip, both my husband and I agreed that this meal was not even close to being worth the $50+ we spent, and we had no interest in eating there ever again.   I can see how the place would be nice for drinking and watching a game on the many TVs, but it's just not up to snuff when it comes to the quality of their food. (I blame an overly active microwave that they're definitely using instead of an oven or grill for items like the brussels sprouts and the shrimp that went on our salads).",

Caswell has taken over the spot that Kennedy's used to occupy, and they have cleaned up the inside, and definitely improved the menu. Overall, I like the vibe here now more, it just seems cleaner/better overall. There's games and activities on their large porch area, but there's also ample amount of seating outside, perfect for our Charlotte weather! The inside has ample seating, but still struggles with the same problem Kennedy's had...the AC! They do have additional units inside, but it still struggles because the building itself is older (but don't let that deter you).   The Caesar salad isn't anything to write home about, in terms of their food, but that was really the only miss out of everything we have ordered there. My husband loves their wings, both because of their meatiness and their spice/flavor options. We have also come for brunch, and their avocado toast is fantastic for a summer day.   Definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed!",
