They offer free soup with your entree, so yes based on the other yelp reviews, you should come hungry. I was searching on my phone for a good place to take some of my local clients, and they enjoyed it just as much as I did. Definitely recommend this place! Since I am in sales, they also offer great catering services, so the next time I have to bring some lunch I will be calling Bedder Bedder & Moore!",

We were warmly greeted, seated quickly, and received a tasty cup of chicken soup.  It's their way of saying welcome and it worked!  Our waitress was great, too.  We ordered a chicken salad on wheat and a Dagwood with a side of potato salad.  The Dagwood would be a better sandwich IMO without the coleslaw which completed with the flavors of the meats and cheese, and it was too messy for my likes.  The hoagie roll was OK but lacked flavor--an unfortunate casualty of most Southern baking.  My wife thought her chicken salad sandwich lacked flavor, too, but was saved by the toasted wheat bread.  Two sandwiches, water only, tax and tip:  $22.50.  Not bad, but lotsa room to improve.",

It use to be the hottest lunch spot in Myers Park/Montfort Park for great food, homemade soup and excellent service and staff.  Now it's lost all consistency. They never have a consistent hostess, the soup, which was the biggest draw has gone downhill. They don't even serve the soups that made them a hit. They've driven off their great employees who were there for many many years and who made the place great. It's just plain mediocre now at best. Sad for the customers who use to stand in line outside waiting for a table. Now it's hardly ever busy. They've lost their regular customers who had been coming for years.

Even an egg salad sandwiches.   I have a peculiar food allergy that confuses them every time the office orders from here. No matter what I order I have to carefully inspect my food to make sure the cook isn't out to get me. Again.   High points are the turkey club and the egg salad. The Asian chicken salad is okay but the chicken has a Greek flavor that conflicts with the sesame dressing. Fries are on the greasy side. They may be better on site when fresh. The sweet tea is good.",

You're there for a great 'wich and a free cup of soup. Yes. Free. As soon as you sit down, your server will bring it over with your beverage.   As for lunch, I chose the Chicken Philly Wrap - a giant grilled wrap stuffed with hearty chunks of grilled chicken breast, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and wrapped with a big slice o' cheese. It was fresh. It was delicious. I would happily get it again sans mushrooms as those canned shrooms give me the willies.  Will I be back? Mmmhmmm.",

Today I had an interesting experience while trying to use Groupon type voucher and it is was a difficult process. The first cashier tried to just take 50% off my meal and tried explaining to her that I already paid for $5 so I could have $10, hence the 50% off. She knew she had never seen this before but still insisted she was right initially but then went to get someone else for help. The second person came up to me and said, \"do we have a problem here sir?\" I could tell when she was serving me earlier that it must have been a bad day and when she asked me that question, it came off in a very un-affable mood. Finally they got the third guy who knew how to take my coupon, but tried telling me I had to buy more food at first.   As I said, I have eaten there before and the previous experience was much better than the latter. But today was an off day, I did not enjoy my time spent.",

It also comes with blue cheese dressing, but I left that off.    Unfortunately, the spices that they used on the blackened chicken along with the blue cheese resulted in the whole thing tasting way too salty for my liking. :-(    Next time I'll stick with one of my stand-bys from here, such as the grilled chicken patti melt (sans dressing of course) or a salad.",

I've had a few pitas and was less than impressed, but other than those everything I've had was really good.   During lunch it gets really busy with mostly moms and older couples. During this time the waitstaff, while always friendly, seems to get overwhelmed.  On nice days they have a few tables outside at which you can sit and enjoy your lunch.

I had heard a few people on Twitter mention this out-of-the-way place, so I was in the area, wrapping up my lunch hour and decided to grab a sandwich to go. (Thanks to my Yelp mobile app, I had no trouble finding it off Montford.) Within just a few quick minutes my toasted sandwich & drink were ready and I was on my way.  Oh.My.Goodness. The turkey sandwich was the messiest, yummiest sandwich I've had in recent memory! I don't even know what I got, since I asked the hostess for a recommendation and that's what I went with. But it had turkey, cheese, coleslaw, and 1000 Island Dressing. I subbed rye bread for whole wheat. I was practically drooling all the way home in the car, as I could smell what promised to be a tasty lunch. It did not disappoint.  The menu looked large, so I will definitely be back to spend a little more time exploring their other options and perhaps trying something new next time.",

    "text": "This is a cozy local place that is pretty busy during the lunch rush. The place is small but surprisingly fits a good number of patrons for dine-in. My husband and I were there this past week with our daughter. They offer a cup of complimentary soup if you dine in, which they asked us if we wanted some, we said yes, and they forgot to give us soup. We asked for soup after a bit of a wait, which was no problem. They apologized for the wait. We got to try their shepherds pie soup, which was hot (temperature wise) and tasty. I had a burger and fries. The burger was fresh but bland, could've used a bit more salt but nonetheless was overall okay. They add fresh lettuce tomato slices and pickles to the burger, and it was on a brioche bun. Fries were hot, fresh, seasoned with celery salt. My husband had the Turkey Smasher with coleslaw--he said it reminded him of a typical \"melt\" sandwich. Coleslaw was crisp and fresh. As for my daughter, they didn't give us a kids menu so we had to ask for one, but they do serve the breakfast items all day and she got the chicken and waffles. The tenders on the plate were very hot and fresh and crispy but tiny for its size. If your child was bigger/hungrier than ours, it wouldn't be a decent portion size. The waffles, however, were big and very yummy. Homemade and fluffy.  Overall, 4.5 stars docking for the above-mentioned items but will be back to try some other items on their menu.",

Since I don't work close to the restaurant anymore, I haven't been there in quite some time. To my dismay I found out after returning home with our order that they have changed their recipe for their chicken salad. \"BLAND\" is the best way to describe it. I can make a tastier chicken salad in my kitchen and just to give the owners a heads up, using way too much celery does not add flavor. Why would you ruin a perfectly wonderful chicken salad recipe by changing it to be so bland it was tasteless? So a heads up to all the chicken salad lovers out there, do yourself a favor & don't order it at BBM, instead, head over to Chicken Salad Chick for delicious chicken salad!",

Arrive early before the lunch crowd, and as you browse the menu of many hot and cold sandwiches and wraps, be sure to note the item number of your selection because that is what you'll tell your server when your order is taken. Don't overlook the salads, quesadillas, and hamburgers either. My favorite items are the # 656 Firecracker Chicken wrap (on the spicy side, so beware) and the very filling # 619 BBQ Chicken Salad (which comes in a large taco shell bowl). I rarely drink sweet tea, but when I do, I only drink BB&M's sweet tea. We go back week after week and are never disappointed. Make Bedder Bedder & Moore YOUR Saturday (or any day) lunch spot!",

When I called 5 min after the salad was delivered I was told by Stephanie (the manager on duty, or  she said) she said that she could send me another salad or credit me a salad for a later date. Since I have a one hour lunch and only had 20min left I chose the credit. I called today 8/2 to redeem my credit and I was told that there was a $15 minimum.. I decided to ask the girls In the office if anyone wanted to order and they did so I called back and spoke to Stephanie to place the order...she NOW stated that I had a .50 cent CREDIT YESSSS A .50 CENT credit towards my order! HOW DOES THAT make up for the WRONG salad they sent me yesterday? It does not make up for it. she continued to argue with me back and forth and said I did not tell you that, bad attitude the whole way through. I said I wanted to speak with her boss and she said she was the manager on duty. If THIS is the way the MANAGER treats her employees I wonder how everyone else is allowed to treat customers? I am so upset that THIS is the way you guys do business, this is ridiculous . Stephanie obviously needs training in customer service. Yesterday 8/1 was my first time eating there, and I WILL NOT BE BACK! And I will also make sure people in the office here know the terrible service or lack of service is provided there! SHAME ON YOU  ****update: minutes after the review was posted, Lisa (The new owner) called me back and let me know she was never made aware of this situation. she made sure to apologize many times and let me know this is NOT how they intend to do business. I appreciate the call and I appreciate the apology...I understand employees do things sometimes that the owners are not aware of, I hope employees get better training and the business grows. Thank you Lisa!",

Happy to help with suggestions on what to have.  At one point our waitress looked at me and said, \"Everything is good, I recommend one of each.\"   Such a great time.    The atmosphere was great.  It was a nice local place that served great food.  Very personable, like hanging out at a friends house.     So onto the food.  Man do they have a great selection.  So much to choose from.  They start off by giving you free soup.  SO GOOD!!!!  My wife had the Itallian panini and I had the Chicken Salad sandwich.  Both had really good flavor.  My wife is picky about Itallian sandwiches and her eyes lit up at first bite.   The chicken salad was pretty tremendous.  Not too much mayonnaise and had a lot of chicken.

This place will give you a great meal, with a good sweet tea, that will leave you feeling happy all afternoon.",

    "text": "First: lots of parking, easy access from many different main roads. A little hidden but clearly marked on building! We were sat and given drinks in an quick manner and everyone was super friendly!! There were other patrons when we walked in but the noise wasn't over barring. The food was so good, I didn't even speak for the first few bites! The coffee, a local company, was phenomenal!!! The pictures are the chicken and waffles that they make in house and the breakfast club, which was what I ate. It comes with either rosemary potatoes or grits. I had the potatoes which were a mix of sweet and russet potatoes!! Over all an amazing breakfast that was all under $25 with both meals and two coffees!!!",

    "text": "Well we were in our way thru Charlotte to Atlanta and decided to give it a try for breakfast as the reviews were fantastic. Not so much.  Prices very inflated for an egg combo (plastic) plate which included 3 teeny slices of avocado, two small pieces of sausage (one piece the 'butt end'...really??) and a margarine/grease soaked biscuit that seemed like it came from a pop can.  My husbands breakfast club was ok but not great.  Also know the grits come orangey due to cheddar added so if you don't want that give a shout out when ordering.  As an aside, 80s transistor quality music.  Come on. We won't be back.",

    "text": "They recently catered our staff Christmas party. Without a doubt their catering has been one of the best I've ever had (and I've been to a lot of weddings.) We were served \"family style\" so large plates filled with food set in front of us. I could have just kept the entire dish of greens in front of me, but of course it was a staff party so I had to act accordingly. I did splurge on the pork chops flavored to perfection with apples (don't ask me how). While everyone around me had maybe 1 pork chop, I was able to devour 2 and a half because in all honesty it was impossible to stop eating them.  Their servers were fast and friendly. If you want catering, and you want it done right this is the place to go. I've never been to the restaurant, but from their excellent catering I will of course make a trip to the restaurant in the near future.",

We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and quickly seated. Drink orders were taken and delivered promptly. Our orders were taken and served in a very timely manner. I had the chicken and waffles served with both warm syrup and a cup of sausage gravy. The 4 chicken strips were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffle was warm with just a bit of crust. My daughter had the biscuits and gravy served in a large bowl. She said it was really good. (I used one of my chicken strips to dip in my gravy and it was hands down the best gravy I've ever had in a restaurant). My fiance went with the eggs and cheese grits. She couldn't rave enough about how delicious they were. We all agreed that this was one of the better places we have tried and that it would not be our last visit. Next time maybe for lunch, as their menu had some interesting things we want to try!!!!",
