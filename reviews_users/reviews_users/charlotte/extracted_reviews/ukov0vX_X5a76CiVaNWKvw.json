The $3.99 breakfast cannot be beat. Have had lunch a couple times, tried the chicken pita on the first go round; which was great, and the corned beef Reuben with potato salad on the second. I enjoy a Reuben with soft thick rye like the kind they use here, but I wouldn't say it tasted like an authentic \"NY deli reuben\".  Potato salad was quite tastey, you can tell its made in house and not from a tub. Yellow based, and tangy as expected.   The best part- one of the cooks is a Deadhead, so if youre a fan too, the conversation can be quite entertaining :)",

    "text": "Sammy's Deli looks like a simple, unassuming burger joint more than a deli. It's the kind of place that you drive by a few times, look at the quaint exterior and sign and pass because you already know of a great burger place that you can count on.   One rainy day while I got my oil changed at nearby Meineke, I decided to give Sammy's a try.  The menu is reasonably priced, ranging from your typical burgers, sandwiches and salads from basic to the ones with lots of fixin's.   The interior isn't very notable. Order up at the register, walk by their open kitchen, and take a seat at one of the vinyl booths with a formica table.   Los Angeles would snap up this authentic old cafe style restaurant and throw in some new modern light fixtures, fill in a cool color scheme to make it less sterile, and hire lots of hot waiters and waitresses. But, Sammy's keeps it real. What you see is what you get, no pretension. It was busy, but no long lines, just a few tables of fireman and local folks.   My cheeseburger was surprisingly pretty good. Well-cooked, well-seasoned, a soft bun and pretty satisfying. Fries were also good. One of the cook's (possibly an owner) came out and asked how we liked things. He was very friendly and not overbearing. We traded tips on nixing computer viruses and spyware.  Sammy's food is solid and is a good alternative to the beaten path joints.",

She made it blatantly clear she did not want to be there and was extremely rude. After we ordered and sat down there was another man who was waiting on a togo order she almost physically pushed him out of her way and basically screamed \"EXCUSE ME\" to him. Shocking. The food portions were huge, and everyone else on staff was friendly and helpful. The food was nothing impressive in my opinion, but I think the single actions of the hateful counter girl really guaranteed we would not be bringing our business back here. As someone who lives so close and is a big supporter of local business it's a real disappointment to cross this place off our list.",

However, if you or someone in your party is a sanitation freak, wear a blindfold or avoid this place. (90% score) The seats were a little torn, stains on the ceiling, someone was smoking. Otherwise, tabletops and floor seemed clean, just an older establishment i guess.  We both just drank water, but two big, filling breakfast meals for under 9 bucks works for me. Overall, a greasy little meal  served on paper plates. Well worth the cost.",

From their incredible breakfasts (even better when hungover) to their savory lunch entrees, Sammy's really knows how to pull it together.  My personal favorites: Breakfast - Western Omelette or the biscuit sandwich (with sausage, obviously) Lunch - Gyro Plate, Triple-Decker Club, or patty melt (when was the last time you had a patty melt)?  This is loved by all sorts of locals. Don't let it's exterior fool you, the food is just what you would be looking for from a local \"greasy spoon\".",

If it wasn't for the servers and the service in this place I would never go back. The waitresses there are cute and friendly and make sure that you're taken care of even if your having a rough day",

    "text": "My go to spot in plaza midwood.  EXTREMELY cheap breakfast specials and reasonable lunch deals mixed with a clean place and quick service.  I'm not saying the food is 5 stars by any means, but the price makes the place worth it.  If I want food for around $5 in plaza midwood its here or HoHo cherry house(my cheap Chinese place).  The $2.99 breakfast special is a great deal, but for a only a dollar or 2 more you can add some extras.  At $3.99 you get 2 eggs, toast or biscuit, hash browns or grits, and your choice of meat.  They bring it out to you, but there isn't waiter service, so no tip is necessary.  FOR REALS $4 out the door with a stuffed belly.  Way better than Waffle house.  I found myself taking advantage of this special quite a bit lately.  The lunch menu is diverse.  Plenty of affordable options.  The gyro has become one of my favorites.  The fried fish ain't bad either.  I'm new to the area and will be in dukedom over there soon enough.  I'll be sure to keep all updated once I delve into the menu more thoroughly.  FYI:  They close at 3pm and you are sure to find FOX news on pretty much any time you go in there.",

The place is what to be expected when you enter, very umm homey. Its clear there are a good deal of regulars here, as the staff seem to know them quite well.   We went around lunchtime so I opted for a sandwich, instead of breakfast. I ordered the tuna melt w/ green beans (I love green beans). The green beans clearly came from a can, & were incredibly salt..which was actually fine by me, but some people may not care for that. The tuna melt itself was very flavorful. My only complaint with it would be that it could've been a bit hotter.   I would really like to try their breakfast, as that seems to be what they're known for.",

We were looking for a quick breakfast spot this morning after trying to go to a popular place up the street only to find that it would be a 45 min wait. Today was the kind of day where I just wanted to say, \"ain't nobody got time for that\" and be on my way. So back to the car we went when it hit me. What about that Sammy's place we always drive by.   So we found ourselves at Sammy's. I was happy to see the reasonable prices and we placed our order and headed to one of the booths. -1 star right now for having a high chair with broken straps.      All of the workers we came in contact with were super friendly and the good was exactly what you would expect from a place like this. Nothing bad- but also nothing spectacular I'm going to be raving about it to my out of town friends.   This seemed like a real locals type of spot and even though we enjoyed food well enough (especially the price tag!) I'm not sure it would be enough to make it into our regular rotation.",

    "text": "Sammy's is one of those Plaza Midwood spots that I've always driven by but just never stopped for. And I'm not quite sure why...? Maybe it's the old school-bare bones-flat-top grill wasteland I thought it would be. But really, Sammy's is a pretty solid stop.   For an array of sandwiches, super affordable breakfast platters and a damn tasty gyro, Sammy's is sweet. I strolled in on a pleasant Friday afternoon and took in the fairly diverse menu. The counter lady/order taker was quite pleasant and even offered some suggestions for me as I was a first timer. I took a seat and took a gander at the basic setup - a smattering of tables and booths, a few friendly faces and that's about it. While you will not go here for the ambiance, the man behind the grill (Sammy or a relative of his, perhaps?) commented on the gorgeous day and my pretty smile. Yes, positivity and flattery works. I liked Sammy's already.   I imagine many of the patrons I saw at Sammy's have been coming here for years. YEARS. And I fully appreciate that...have to trust a place where loyalty is important.   My gyro was pretty tasty - the meat was super tender, the pita soft and lightly toasted but the tzatziki could have used a bit more of a punch. I was not a fan, however, of the side I chose, potato salad. Sammy's make theirs with a heavy hand of yellow mustard. This would be really helpful info for those of us who don't particularly love yellow mustard laden tater salad. Nonetheless, the portions were generous - especially for the $6.50 price tag. I'll be back Sammy's and I'll tell ya - that BLT looked purty good...",

The corned beef and kraut were pretty good, but the cheese was almost non-existent as was the russian. The bread had good flavor, but again the second sandwich was almost hard to eat at times (we switched just so I understood - she wasn't lying about the bread).

I have probably eaten this food over 20 times in over a year but today was my first time sitting down and enjoying this authentic spot for great breakfast and lunch. The staff is uber friendly. Smiles and laughs for days. Needless to say no more take out for me...this food is to be enjoyed sitting down amongst good folk and friendly faces!!",

There's ample seating, 2 flatscreen TV's for viewing pleasure and you can order whatever is on the menu at any time.   I ordered the chicken philly and fried squash.   They have themselves another customer. I'm thoroughly satisfied.",

I like getting the classic breakfast and my boyfriend often gets the sandwiches.  Family-run place that reminds me of all the places I grew up going to in New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland. The staff is extremely friendly and always have smiles on their faces.  As long as your expectations are for a no-frills blue collar joint, this place will never disappoint.",

    "text": "Hole in wall dinner. The menu is extensive, sandwiches,  seafood platters, veggie plates, hamburgers to name a few. Most plates come with a side and are prices in the $7-8 range. Food is ordered at the front, cooked to serve and comes up fast. It  is brought to you by the staff, who are marginal at best. The inside definitely has that hole in the wall feel meaning if looks dirty because nothing has been updated in years, the seats of chairs and booths are stained and have tears from age. But overall food is a B+ and there is something for everyone",
