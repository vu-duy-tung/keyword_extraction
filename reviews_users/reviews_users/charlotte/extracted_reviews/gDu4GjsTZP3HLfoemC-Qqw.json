Downstairs speakeasy had a great atmosphere and the Smoked Old Fashioned was good. However, after waiting for over 20 minutes to attempt to get a 2nd drink, we left.",

We sat down at the table to wait for 10 minutes before our server got to us. We had to ask for her as well. She was not pleasant in the slightest bit. My husband, mother and I all ordered martinis. When we finally got them, they were in wine glasses because they \"didn't have enough\". When my husband complained about this to the manager, he brought back the martini in a dirty martini glass and my husband's drink looked cloudy, not clear. We ordered apps - the shrimp and cheese plate. Both were not up to par compared to how overpriced they were. We decided to get the check and go somewhere else due to poor service and food. The manager knew we were upset with our experience and did not comp one item off the menu-even the martini we did not drink. I will never go back here or recommend it to anyone. Horrible experience.",

Avoid the Margarita Cansino (the Rita Hayworth nod is lit) unless you absolutely love the flavor of agave spirit. The sazerac still has me buzzed hours later. If the bartenders were just a bit more attentive, and the kitchen had later hours, this would be a 5 star for me.",

We asked what the soup of the day was, she then walked around aimlessly for 5 minutes then went into the kitchen for another 5 minutes... Only to come back and ask us if we had any questions or if we were ready to order... Well we would still like to know what the soup is...  She made her way back to kitchen and came back to tell us the soup of the day was a potato soup, I then asked if it had bacon pieces in it and she replied no it did not. Well it did have bacon in it (I love bacon but if you dont eat pork for any number of reasons you may be upset if it comes to you containing that magically delicious meat) ... I ordered a beer and my wife ordered an Irish coffee because it was so cold inside, our waitress then asks my wife what she would like her Irish coffee made with... come on it's not that hard, the bartender supposedly knew how to make one... She came back with hot black coffee with a single shot of Jameson in it... no baileys or creme or sugar... Every other word that came out of this girls mouth was \"For sure\"  We recieved our check and I was blown away at how expensive it was... a single shot of Jameson is $13 here!!! Another 10 bucks and you can buy a bottle!! Our tab was over $45 for 1 beer, 1 horrible excuse for an Irish coffee, and 2 small cups of soup...

Loren & Mike are seasoned professional mixologists behind the bar with no shame in their game making proper Old Fashions.

Exactly what they advertise it as definitely a speakeasy with great prohibition themed drinks and an awesome menu that describes where the drink originated. You feel like you've been transported back to the 1920's. Comfortable seating and great 1920's themed music. Definitely recommend for an after dinner drink.",

    "text": "Came here for Fathers Day. Made a reservation the day before to be sat outside since we brought a dog, which I thought was great that they are ok with. Got there, waited an hour ten to be seated, though they had empty tables on the patio, were sat then waited another 30 minutes to have waters brought to our table. One of the Dad's let the waitress know about the terrible service so far, and then a manager came out to apologize letting us know they had 4 waitstaff call out, which is understandable, it's not like we had the option to go anywhere else at that point. I wonder if anything would have been said if he didn't complain. They had a mimosa special which was great, the manager comped our first round which was much appreciated. The food was decent, a few people got the chicken and cornbread waffles, decent, a little dry on the waffle. The salads were great, chicken pesto paninis with Manchester sauce also decent. I've been here before for dinner as well and we loved the wings, Mac and cheese, shrimp, rice. What I didn't understand was that, even after having staff being out, they still had every single time slot open on opentable, and we saw parties coming in while were eating that were just sitting there waiting just as long or longer than us. You'd think that if you didn't have the staff you'd adjust the reservations you're taking so you don't ruin people father's day meals with ridiculous waits? Stars for the dog friendly patio, manager eventually apologizing, decent food (primarily dinner not the brunch we had).",

They took 10 mins to have a server come over after being seated, then another one decided to take our order (then our real server was confused about this and had to chase the other one to get our order from her!), drinks (overpriced) took too long to come out... overall a frustrating experience that keeps you wondering when the hell you'll get service instead of enjoying your visit. Food was good but it's basically fancier bar food options, so given the chaotic service, long waiting times and overpriced drinks it's not a place I'd go back to.

    "text": "Normally don't write these, but feedback is important for cool new spots, but first a disclaimer: We only got there with enough time to experience the \"late night\" version of this place around 10PM More on that in a sec.  One star for a few reasons:  It took us about 20 minutes to get a drink after getting the attention of a bartender, it wasn't really THAT busy when we got there. Busy, but not any busier than a regular bar right before the rush on a Friday evening, and they didn't have a drink menu (they took olives and wine upstairs and only served generic drinks). Kinda lame... Additionally, the atmosphere was cool, but they tried to turn it into a night club (why?) for the \"late\" part of the night.  Ill say this: nobody going to this place off of the advertising wanted a club experience. If I wanted to go to a club, I wouldn't go to a speakeasy. The whole experience was just confusing and frustrating. It doesn't work as a night club, it's too small, and the point of having a secret \"password protected\" lounge is completely lost on the fact that they tried to turn it into a party scene WITH BOTTLE SERVICE(?) Who the heck will pay for that at THIS place? Nobody is there for bottle service...  I wouldn't recommend going here for the club portion of the night, which by the way starts way too early.  I bet it'd be really awesome to go during the speakeasy hours for that nice niche experience, but I won't be back for the night scene. There's places for that scene, and Room 1812 is not it. Way too small for it.",

While we were there, we each ordered one drink and a charcuterie board that had meat, cheese, and bread. Upon receiving the board we noticed that it was incredibly difficult to bite into our slices of \"bread\" and it felt like our teeth were breaking with every bite. We asked our waitress if they had anything softer and she brought us back some toasted pita bread. The next morning we were both ill and throwing up the whole day. We believe that the charcuterie board was either sitting out for too long or that the meat and cheese were not kept at the right temperature to serve to guests.   On top of the food poisoning, Our waitress was having trouble remembering everything we had ordered. She asked our friend if she needed another margarita without bringing her the first one...and also had to ask my girlfriend after putting 2 glasses of wine on our check if she actually ordered 2 glasses or just 1. She had only ordered 1 and sent her back to remove it and bring the new check. Our friends asked what one of the cakes on the menu was like and she responded with \"it's cute\". Not sure that was the response she was looking for in terms of describing what the dessert was.   Anyways It would have been fine if this was a weekend and they were busy but it was a Wednesday night with an average amount of people in the bar. The bar staff was dressed up in flapper dresses and feathered headbands. It was a little too over the top for me and seemed like this place is trying too hard to be a speakeasy.   Beware of food poisoning if you go here!",

The deviled eggs were decent.   When a salad is split between 2 people, split it in the back. That prevents the guests from having to waste their time splitting it, and not enjoying their time there.   Why did our entrees arrive before the salads??  Odd, not very English.   $30 \"12 oz. Prime\" ribeye, ordered MR, that was WD and looked like it was grilled on the grill's cold spot by somebody's 8 year old.   Furthermore, the inability to use 2 very important ingredients in savory cooking. S&P!!  The asparagus was heartbreaking.   The service wasn't any better. I'll save my thumbs and I'll leave it with a surprising, yet unsurprising disappointment.   I can deal with bad service, if the food is prepared  the way it should be and sent out accordingly.

I couldn't believe how many shrimp we got and they were perfectly fried.  The Jalapeno Bacon deviled eggs were decent, but not something I would have to order again. The pretzel twists and beer cheese were yummy, just wish there were more pretzel sticks.  We split the cheapest bottle of red wine (we're classy broads) and our total was ~$30 a person with tip?

Service was quick, food was tasty and the space was clean and not too loud. Nothing we ate blew me away, but for a walkable southend restaurant I definitely want to come back and try more things! As a note, entrees are a bit overpriced IMO. I got a sandwich and fries for half the price of my boyfriends entree and we got the same amount/quality of food",

To our excitement, Manchester had no wait, and the menu looked pretty good. Based on the decor, this is likely a really nice bar/date spot at night though the ambience felt a little weird for 12:00 on a Sunday. Two words - Lobster Roll - Get it! It was delicious. It came with a side of fries (which were a little to heavily salted), but the lobster roll more than made up for it. Huge chunks of lobster, a buttery roll, and very little filler/mayo. I will definitely be back! By the way, we were done with our meal and halfway home when Tupelo finally texted and said our table was ready....",

It took 15 minutes for someone to come by to fill our glasses and we had to ask for our server and menus. Our server came over and apologized, telling us that they all thought someone else had our table. She also sat down at our table to take our orders which was weird.

The drinks are on par with speakeasies you would find in NYC as are the knowledge of the bartenders. The vibe is dark enough to make you want to stay off your phone, the music is classic 20s Jazz, and they play old black and white movies in the background. They have a bar in the center along with couches lining the room. The servers dress up in True 20s fashion. It really is a valiant effort and a valiant execution of bringing a speakeasy vibe to charlotte that is truly, currently lacking.  Thank you, Room 1812, for stepping this up a knotch, and for making this a real, authentic speakeasy. Keeep it up!   P.S. I spoke with the servers about the \"club vibe\" that a lot of these reviews mention and they shared that this venue is no longer transferring into a club in order to stay True to their speakeasy patrons. Bravo!",

    "text": "Do you like the idea of paying $40 for an appetizer, a beer, and a Bloody Mary? Do you like paying that amount and then realizing you could have gotten the whole thing at Applebee's instead for roughly half the price and the same generic quality? Do you want to find your food so egregiously overpriced that you'll leave halfway through your meal to find another restaurant? Then head down to the Manchester!   The interior of the place is cute enough. However, it doesn't match with the vibe. The food is British pub style, but the decor resembles a hip sushi place. I guess the fact that almost no one was there during Saturday lunch rush should have clued me in that culinary delights were not in store for me.   I was happy to find one of my favorite local beers on tap. I was less happy that it cost $10. I get that it's a craft beer, but it's also local, and that felt overpriced to me. Our server, though nice enough, inexplicably didn't bring the cocktail menu until we requested it. He also told us we were his second table ever. I wasn't exactly sure what to do with that information. Perhaps, in his own way, he was subtly urging us to turn back. My wife ordered what was essentially a Bloody Mary with tequila--at a $14 price tag. I love Bloody Marys, but this was incredibly bland and average. I would've felt better paying $8 for it.   We decided to get an appetizer while perusing the menu and opted for the spinach and artichoke dip. We received an almost comically small bowl of dip with pita chips. The pita chips were greasy enough to leave residue on your fingers. Yum! The dip was okay. You know what wasn't okay? The fact that it cost $12.   At this point, nothing on the menu looked good enough to justify its price. $19 for fish and chips? $12 for a basic cheeseburger with American cheese? Now, I don't mind spending money on good food. I'll pay $150 for lunch at Hello Sailor without batting an eye. But the prices have to be in line with the quality and style of food. This is cooking for middle America, and it's not worth it. We opted to stop at this point and not order anything else.   I felt better about that decision when an incredibly overpowering fish odor permeated the room all of a sudden. I scanned the menu for the strongest fish. Salmon? No. Fish and chips? No. I'm not sure if something was off, but I wasn't interested in finding out.   Pass on this one. If you're tempted for mediocre bar food, at least go to Applebee's or TGI Friday's because at least you'll save money. And I'm saying that as someone who hates those places.",

At first, the voice in the loudspeaker turned away the group we were standing behind citing an hour wait, but we decided to hang out and see if we could get in anyway. Sure enough, a few minutes later the door opened and some people exited, so we just walked in. There was no one at the door carding people or asking for the password, so we just found seats at the bar and ordered some drinks.   It took a little while to get our drink order taken and each of the drinks seems to take some time to prepare. But they were worth the wait.   The vibe was chill, I think there was a dj spinning lounge-y tracks. The bathrooms are single stalls so I could see how there could be long lines when the place is packed.   There is a staircase you can go up that opens into the Manchester restaurant (it opens up as a secret panel behind the hostess stand). We were starving so we decided to go upstairs and grab some dinner.",

There wasn't a wait on the dining side, so we were able to get seated right away for a table of four. We started off with the spinach dip. It came with warm pita and the dip was in a small cask iron skillet. It was good, nothing out of this world for $12. My friends ordered the shrimp and deviled eggs app. I didn't try them, but they looked good.  I ordered the prime steak and cheese sandwich. The bread was fresh and the sandwich was ok.  I don't mind at all paying for food, but $15 for a sandwich and fries that aren't made in house, just makes me feel like it's not worth it.  Everyone thought their food was good, nothing special. Since the bar area was so busy, it took a while for our drinks to come (wine and old fashions). I was a little confused by the music and the overall theme of the restaurant. I liked the music (90s-2000s hip Hop) but just felt like \"what's going on here\".  Overall, I don't know if I would come back to eat. I do want to try Room 1812 once it opens and I would grab a drink in the bar area.",

We arrived and asked to sit outside because it was a beautiful day. We sat down and our waitress (Alex) came up very quickly, we had hardly even completely sat down.  We said we would need a moment to settle in and look at the menu... she just stood there... we told her again please give us sometime. Then she comes back in one minute, making ya feel quite rushed. We were still not even close to being ready.   Anyways we finally placed our order and started our wait for the food. When the food arrived I immediately was confused by my $19 fish and chips having one single piece of fish. Also an order at our table had the wrong side and when we told the food runner he was quite bothered and didn't apologize for the mistake.   When our server finally came back I had to ask for ketchup (ALWAYS BRING THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE FRIES) and I questioned my portion size. I saw the table next to us have two piece on their fish and chips... but she claimed it was suppose to be one. THAT IS A CRAZY PRICE FOR A SINGLE PIECE OF FREAKING FISH!   I won't be returning to this location because you can't run a restaurant on location and nice decor alone. You have to have good food at a decent value and great service which they didn't have any of.   Save your money and go somewhere else!",

Now the drinks that's a different story we all enjoyed our drinks and the staff made it fun for us to step into the speak easy it's like a secret wall that you tap into and you enter into what appeared to be a very jazz old school vibe basement it was super cool and that was probably the most enjoyable part of our night there . Once arriving and leaving there is a photo screen op to take photos with yourself and friends and you can have them emailed or text to your phone which I thought was pretty cool .

I loved the lattice work with ivy and wood textures throughout the restaurant.   I also like the whimsy;  there is a wall with empty frames hanging on them.  Haha.  I liked the funky lighting and the bar. This is another warehouse type place, with exposed black pipes on the ceiling.  It is definitely probably more of a pub and bar than it is an eatery, but with that said, my garden salad with grilled salmon on it was very good.  Loved the apple cider viniagrette and its tang!   Kathleen ordered the lobster roll and let out a lot of happy sounds when she was eating it.  The menu wasn't huge, but was good for an upscale pub.  The service was good.  Several different people came by to check on us.  The music that was playing was from a generation ago, so we enjoyed it.  It was not softly in the background, but the sounds were dominantly wafting in the air!  This restaurant is across the parking lot from Tupelo Honey.  It's easy to find in the SouthEnd, right on South Blvd, just before East Blvd.  If you are out and about and want a cool atmosphere for a meal or a drink, this is a great choice.  You may want to hire the same interior designer to come add some funk to your home!",

Now for the food: I had the basil chicken panini..pretty average. The chicken was somewhat cold for some of the bites I took which took away from a lot of it. It would have been much better if it wasn't cold. Fries with the sauce were pretty good though. Pretty average overall.",

However, once you spend more time with him you see that he only comes around intermittently, and each attempt to fulfill the most basic of commitments, falls short.   I want to believe it's his first day. At least that would explain some of it. Or maybe he is racist and hates white people, but his complexion makes me think there is more to it.    Maybe he has never been to a restaurant himself. I mean, he doesn't seem to know refills are a thing, and he just brought me a light-pink colored sauce he seems to believes is ketchup. Who knows?  Food's good though. So, there's that.   Note: If you read that anything has \"A-1 steak sauce\" on it, it's a damn lie. Unless \"A-1\" is the lowest score on an in-house sauce ranking system. Perhaps this is Costco's (or some other chain's) generic interpretation of A-1, or it was expired. Or both. (Like several years gone.) Not sure, but \"A-1 Steak Sauce\", my good sir, it was not.   Also, if you come across any drink garnishes that are a deal-breaker for you, be prepared to bring your own or fight your server to the death for that skewer of olives. Up to you.",

The day of I had dropped off his cake and balloons and they stored it for me. When we arrived the tables were set and ready for us. I loved the fact they had a photo booth in entrance which just made this experience even better !!  It was a party of 17, we all didn't show up together. So I know that was kind of aggravating. But our servers did not seem bothered by that. (at some places you can read it all over their faces) Our servers where amazing !!! They took excellent care of each one of us.   We started with the spinach artichoke dip, firecracker shrimp (I was nervous based on the yelp reviews) , deviled eggs and fried pickles, all amazing appetizers!!!  Everyone enjoyed their food all great complaints. Just to name a few dishes my party recommend: Shrimp and grits, seafood risotto and lobster roll. We did have some problems with the filet they just couldn't get the temperatures right either it was too rare or too burnt. But again they were very helpful! Loved this restaurant!",

    "text": "Tried this place out for restaurant week.  Not very impressed.  8pm reservation and arrived at 8:05 (parking was a challenge as there were literally vehicles parking in the mulch in the rear/making their own spaces.  Anyway, arrived and was informed that no tables were ready and that it would be a 15 minute wait.  Told them we had reservations and they were able to procure a table after 5-7 minutes.  After sitting down we tried ordering a bottle of the Malbec only to learn that they did not carry that variety (yet??) settled on two glasses of Riesling. (I ordered the Greek salad-lobster/shrimp risotto with asparagus while my wife ordered the ginger salad with lamb chops. (Desserts to be ordered later)   Salads arrived quickly. No wine yet.  Apparently the bar was busy...though there were 6 empty tables to our right. My Greek salad had an abundance of hummus and grilled shrimp however no calamari while my wife's seemed to meet expectation.  After salad was done our wine arrived.  Generous sized pour, but the wine itself wasn't all that great.  Entrees arrived.  My risotto was advertised to have a lobster tail & claw along with shrimp....which if I added it all together probably had a totality about 4 shrimp and a half of a 1lb-lobster sized tail mixed in with the dish. A lot of cheese and risotto.  Sort of goopy without much presentation. Average taste for a dish with such lauded ingredients.  Asparagus was good.  The lamb chops with root vegetables my wife ordered were cooked perfectly and nicely presented on the wooden board.  Might have suggested the sauce be on the side so the root veggies and lamb didn't cook it. Yogurt based tzatziki sauce shouldn't be warmed up by the dish.  Pretty tasty though.     Waitress checked in a couple times mid meal and on the second occasion asked what we wanted for dessert while assuring us that the selections wouldn't arrive until after we completed our entrees.  About 1 minute later she arrived back to the table with them (peanut butter cake and truffle.  We sent her away with them since we were still mid-meal.  She came back three minutes later with them and left them at open spots on the table. For the dessert the cake had plenty of peanut butter flavor but seemed to not really have much else going for it aside from the moisture content.  The truffle was ok.  It's chocolate moose filling seemed flavorful but the nut/crumble base was lacking.     Though it was restaurant week I couldn't help but be disappointed in the service we received.  Our water glasses spent more time empty than full and we had to stack plates on the edge of our table while numerous wait staff passed by seemingly oblivious of our need to make room for what ended up being a pressured/rushed meal.  The kicker was we were adjacent to the kitchen and yet we had to still request water and for plates to be removed.  Not worth the $94 bill.      Having worked in hospitality at a 4-diamond resort I've come to appreciate quality food and service.  Neither seemed to be the case with this establishment.",

It's actually what made me go back with my family..... but that's where it turned for me - appetizers are still Uber tasty (deviled eggs & Brussels sprouts are noteworthy)! However, it's like something falls apart with the main courses. Hubs ordered prosciutto grilled cheese..... way TOO MUCH prosciutto and not enough cheese. Toast was thick and hearty but the sandwich was lackluster at best. My salad was a horrible disappointment - chuck full of what should have been great, but tomatoes were sad. They were multicolored (exciting) but mushy. And no, they were not stewed tomatoes, just BAD mushy. The taste was \"fungus-y\" to sum it up. I couldn't finish. Good thing o devoured those deviled eggs!!!   Bartender/server was a great personality, but I'd guess he's not everyone's millennial funky, trendy type and he could make some folks crazy. We enjoyed him enough, but he continued to refer to us as \"friends\" which made the table near us aggravated (they noted they were NOT his friends). I'll take kind servers over miserable versions any day. Sadly, this place has made the \"do not return anytime soon\" list.",

The buffalo sauce had a little heat and a hint of sweetness. I'm a fry junkie, so I got an order of those too!  These fries were hot and crispy, with the perfect amount of salt. Wednesday is also half priced wine, so it was a win...regardless of the horrible singles mixer!",

I really enjoy going out to eat & the server clearly has knowledge of the menu items to the extent that they have actually tried/had most of the food there.   I had some of the spinach & artichoke dip, spicy dry rub wings, and the black bean burger with seasoned fries.   The spinach and artichoke dip was super tasty. I liked the consistency of the dip & the pita chips that came with it. I'm typically not a fan of pita chips to be honest, but these were crispy & went really well with the dip.  The wings and the fries were ok. Nothing to really get excited about. The black bean burger itself was really good. You can tell a quality black bean burger by how much it falls apart. Now the bread that the black bean burger was in, I personally did not like.  It was dry and kind of cheap to me.",

All the best appetizers (according to our server) and I would have to agree are all $5.   I shared the Brussels and Bacon, Wings and Jalapeno Deviled eggs.   The Brussels and bacon are what dreams are made of! They are so savory and delicious. The wings have the BEST dipping sauce. I don't know what's in it but I loved it. And you really can't ever go wrong with deviled eggs not they definitely kicked it up a notch.   I would order all of these again and again.   But then it was time for the entree. I ordered a burger with a side of fried grits. The burger was a bit dry and didn't have any flavor. It was topped with cheese and bacon but still it was lacking something. And I can't even explain the fried grits. But they were not good. I asked for an extra side of sauce to see if that would help (it did not)  but there was no saving them.   So the sever that brought the extra sauce said that the fried grit are a hit for brunch. Because they come topped with a fried eggs and bacon. Honestly, I'm willing to try that.   So stay tuned for my brunch update. But for now they are just A-ok in my book.",

The bones (yes, bones) of this place provides a enough space to come hang out with a group of friends, while balancing the intimate feel if you want to just have a nice even with your beau. Also, if you're with a small/medium group... ask if you can sit in front of the fire place (if it's going) or outside on their patio on a nice day/evening. It was just two people in my party so we were able to grab a high-top table near the bar.   It took a little while for our waitress to approach us, but once we placed our drink orders everything else was seamless. I decided to try The Original burger (it was my one cheat day - go big or go home, right?) with a side of fries and I'm glad I did. First and foremost, I NEVER... I repeat... I NEVER eat all my fries! It was something about these that just hit the spot! The burger was cooked perfectly and I was grateful for their knives that cut it in half without chopping up my bun (knives used to cut burgers make a difference, LOL).   Overall, I will give them another try even if just for happy hour. Also, if you're there don't forget to ask your waiter(ess) to show you down to Room 1812 (their very own speakeasy). Keep in mind, that you'll need the password to get in... (hint: follow Room 1812 on IG, it's posted daily on their stories)! Hope to see you there!",

    "text": "Place: It was a very nice modern/old fashion resturant! Lots of decor. The speakeasy makes you feel like your back in the prohibition era. Loved every bit of it. Food and drink: slightly pricey. Spent close to $70 for 2 drinks each and a dessert and about the same on an app and 2 entrees. So it was a pricey night out. Drinks were tastey. They have a separate drink menu downstairs, but also serve the entire dessert menu in the speakeasy.  Service: our waitress was prompt. Refilled my water several times and continued to check on us. When we asked how to get downstairs the manager walked us around personally.  All and all an awesome little place. Will definitely return. A definite recommend.",

    "text": "This place is definitely a must if you are looking to do something fun and different. You can make a reservation but it's not required. We went on a Saturday and got a table immediately. The waiter was super nice, and the decoration is really nice. Don't expect that much out of the food it's not bad but it's not a meal that you think it's great! I would do some improvements in that aspect. The drinks were really good and strong, so take it slow.   The cool part of the experience is at the end of your meal ask your waiter that you would like to have dessert and after dinner drinks. They require a password were you can find on their instagram account, so make sure you check prior. They then take you downstairs to their speakeasy which I LOVED. It was dark and old school and the drinks were really good too!   I will definitely come back and recommend this place! I just would love for the menu to be a little more improved!!",

    "text": "Located across the parking lot from Tupelo Honey, we happenstanced here for brunch when the waiting time at Tupelo's was an hour. The lighting at Manchester's is uniquely elegant - the walls were of a slatted woodsy design that was offset by back panels of light. As much as I liked the lighting, the dining area was a bit dark for a brunch meal.  I opted the veggie frittata.  The kale salad atop the frittata added texture, flavor and color - perfect for a light protein breakfast. The star of my breakfast were the grits we ordered as a side. Omgosh....absolutely delicious! It was prepared as sticks, breaded and fried - Great compliment to the meal. We also ordered the monkey bread which was basically a cinnamon roll. It was a nice add-on nonetheless.  The service was very attentive. Looking forward to future visits to try other items on their menu - with a side of grits, of course.",

    "text": "After seeing a post on CHARLOTTE Agenda, I was super excited when my coworkers suggested we try Manchester's for Lunch.   Entrance Walking in, at first I was saddened because they replaced The Liberty, a restaurant I enjoyed. But I was excited to try Manchester thanks to the recent post. At the entrance my coworker noticed their neon sign, \"you are exactly where you need to be,\" and as we turned around there was a photobooth! How fun! Of course, we snapped and sent several pics then headed into the restaurant.  Dining Room We were immediately taken to our seat and walking in I noticed the changes for The Liberty but also a few decors that they kept. Sitting down our server greeted us and provided menus. The menu visibility was so hard to look at. It's a naturally dark restaurant, and the background was like a wood forest image with white lettering. Unfortunately, it was the first few bad things we noticed because we work in marketing.   Price The food is considerably overpriced especially for what they offer. You would think they offer a lunch menu or pricing, but they do not.  Food I ordered the firecracker shrimp, and I was not impressed at all. The flavor was good because they used so much breading, looks were very deceiving when the food came out. Myself and one of my coworkers ordered the chicken sandwich. It was so incredibly salty with every bite we took. The roof of our mouth had the feeling when you overeat salt, and it feels like you've burnt it. We barely ate a quarter of the burger, and she finished her fried, and I passed my fried grits to my other coworker. I was not impressed or pleased with anything. When the manager finally made his way to our table, I was not impressed with his comments. To quote him he said, \"I'm sorry the chicken was salty today, but look at it this way you get a free meal!\" apparently he completely missed the issue.  Staff The manager was at least 4feet from our table the only time he approached our table was when we had an issue with the food. Then entire time he stood at the kitchen looking into the dining room but did not move in our direction. Typically the manager will make there way around the restaurant, introduce their self and ask how the food is before there's a problem,  it this person. I will say I served was great! She consistently checked on us, and when we were hesitant to share how made our experience was with the food, she recognized it and immediately addressed the problem.   Leaving my friends and I stayed, the best part about this restaurant was the entrance. It's not likely we will be back for a while for the food, we were hoping it would be on point since it's new.",

The food is good, but feels a bit pricey for the experiences we had.    I've had the charcuterie board, bacon jalapeno deviled eggs and (twice) greek seafood salad.   The greek seafood salad is on a bed of white bean hummus that is really tasty - and probably the reason I'll come back...  But, the service (both times) was SO SLOW and inattentive.  It seemed like the servers were either overbooked with tables or just not concerned with taking orders, filling drinks, checking on food, etc.  The food was brought out by people who didn't know what it was...truly, guessing what the food was to determine who had ordered it.  The second time, our appetizer didn't arrive until way after our entrees.    It's a decent experience, but not outstanding.",

    "text": "Decided to come here for my birthday dinner with my wife, they were slow when we arrived and we were seated right away. We had the option to sit at the bar area, outside, or in main dining room. We opted for the bar area, once seated we were quickly greeted by our server who was friendly and she took our drink order.  We ordered the beer cheese pretzel twists for our appetizer, the standard portion comes 4 twists to an order, or 2 for the happy hour discounted portion. They were pretty good, but could have used a bit more salt, the cheese sauce was great though. For the main course I ordered the prime steak and cheese sandwich with fries for my side. The order came out in a reasonable time and was very good. The fries are battered and crispy and come with a side of some dipping sauce that is also pretty good.  After we ate we decided to pay a visit to the 1812 room, the hidden speakeasy that requires a password to get in. We were escorted there by the manager, since we didn't know where to go, he was very friendly.  It was very dim in there and had a decor reminiscent of the speakeasy days. The primary drink menu is specialty cocktails, but bottled/canned drinks are also available. We ordered dessert and drinks, both of which arrived quickly. The drink was stiff and the dessert was decent, we had the mousse madness, I was already full, so maybe I'd have enjoyed it more if I wasn't already stuffed.  We finished our dessert and relocated to one of the comfortable couches in the room to finish our cocktails, then we ordered another round of drinks while relaxing. It was a great experience and we'll likely come back again, even if only to visit the speakeasy. I found the drink prices to be a bit steep, but for the unique experience I suppose it's ok to splurge on occasion. I would give the place a try, access is easy and there is parking in the back of the building that is also shared with the business next door. The light rail station is also right behind the place, so that makes it easier to get there as well.",

The bar area to the right is causal. They have a couch area and high top tables along with the outdoor patio. The more formal dining area is to the left. The inside will remind you of the Liberty if you went there before it closed. The decor is definitely different and very interesting.   We got the kale and brussel salad, the noble chicken sandwich, and the pork belly banh mi. I'm not a big salad fan, but that salad didn't even taste like a salad -- it was amazing. The banh mi was my favorite -- incredibly flavorful and delicious. The chicken sandwich was just ok.   Overall, I like what they've done with the place and thought the food was pretty good!",

Such a cool little spot! Went here after work right when they opened for the day. Checked the password on their Instagram (room_1812) and buzzed right in. Dim lights, old black and white movies playing, old time bar music and the staff dressed to the nines of the time!  Now the drinks are more than enough to write home about! You know when you get the drink menu and there are no prices, you're probably going to be paying a pretty penny, but at the same time you expect to get a strong and delicious concoction... which they were spot on here! I asked the bartender what the best drink was/what he made the best and I ordered that. I can't remember the name but it had gin, raspberry, an egg white and vermouth. It was beautiful, strong and DELICIOUS!!! The friends I was with ordered a mojito and gin gimlet, both were delicious as well!  Definitely a fun atmosphere during the Speakeasy Hours! Interested to see it during the \"DJ/club\" hours, as currently the reviews aren't great, but it's only been opened a week so hopefully it gets better and I have something good to report back with. Until then, go get your speakeasy on folks!",

If you don't drive the metro literally has a stop behind the parking lot! Upon entering they have a foyer area where you can take a selfie and the other side with a positive quite about your presence and flowers. They have indoor and outdoor seating. If you choose to sit outside they have fans. I choose to sit at the bar after asking about specials. From 4-7 they have a limited menu of discounted food items. You can also order from the main menu too. David was an awesome bartender and I told him to create something I could enjoy. No pressure right?! Lol well he did a great job. It was called the \" Vanishing Tiffany\" as he said because I was going to make it vanish and I did. The wings were tasty the pretzel was fresh... I didn't care for their mustard sauce that came with the pretzel. The deviled eggs with jalapenos are dangerous. Make sure you clear your plans after eating those you can clean out a room.  The plates on the table weren't clean, but we were able to find some clean ones on the empty table next to us.  I got the chicken pesto panini which was filling and flavorful. It was noted to be a popular item on the menu. The fries were crispy and good.  I was way too full for desert. I would like to return again to try some different dishes at another time frame. Overall it was a pleasant experience. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I came here twice in one week, so let's talk about each experience separately. The first visit, I had a decent experience. They have $5 apps before 7PM and they have a good selection of items. I liked the deviled eggs, wings, and brussel sprouts the best. They were all very good. The eggs were my favorite. The wings come with a delicious sauce. I ordered the goat cheese salad for an entree and was sadly disappointed. The goat cheese was so yummy, it's one of my favorites. The onion straws on top were disgusting. I also asked for no craisins, but they put them on anyway. The waiter said they made the onions in house every AM. Gross. They were stale tasting and tough. They ruined the rest of the salad. It also needs to have more beets. The butternut squash soup was ok, but actually too sweet, even for me. The waiter was so nice. He was one of the best I've had in awhile. I have no service complaints.   The second visit was a late night bite. We had artichoke dip, pretzels, and hummus. All disgusting!!!!!!!!!  I mean, disgusting. The pretzels were too large and stale tasting. The artichoke dip was the worse flavor I've ever tasted in my life. The hummus was extremely bland, flavorless. The pita chips were the soft ones and they had a horrific aftertaste. Again, the service was good. They have some great people working for them, but the food needs some help.  I would not recommend eating here. Or, if you do: wings, sprouts, and eggs only.",

When the bartender finally gets to me, I order an old fashioned.  The bartender tells me that they don't serve craft cocktails after 11.00 pm and I that need to order a mixed drink ..... The current time was 10.55 pm.  The bar staff obviously isn't very good and it ruins what could be a great place.",

    "text": "My first experience here was a few weeks ago when my husband and I stopped in for a drink and appy at the bar. We had the spinach/artichoke dip, which was fantastic. The bartender was super nice. When we went for dinner with a couple friends last week, we had a parallel universe experience. The waitress had a terrible attitude and was very unfriendly. The service was erratic. I had ordered a beer and got it when we were almost through - she had probably forgotten, and it wasn't even busy. We were the only ones in the back room, which is beautiful by the way. I had the fish and chips, which I wouldn't get again because the fish was thick and had a weird consistency, like it had been frozen for a long time. Our friends were similarly put off by the bad service and surprising lack of quality in the food. It's also expensive for pub food, but you see that a lot in Charlotte. My friends said they would not go back. I would consider going back, but hope to get a waitress who didn't act like she hated waiting on us. That is just uncomfortable. Anyway, I try to give new places a second chance because they could just be ironing out the wrinkles.",

If you're visiting  Charlotte, RUN to the Manchester, experience the dining at the bar and then tickle down to room 1812 in the basement.  This is a hidden gem... THE HIDDEN GEM of the city. Go see the lively crowd, have a couple Corpse Reviver 2's and hear all about the local speakeasy scene.  I came to the Manch tonight, had an incredible experience and ventured downstairs through the walled subdivision.  Enter if you dare. But be aware, there's entry to the 5 other local realms dow there.   Peace, love.  Enjoi",

We had 14 people in our party, many of whom ordered different dishes, and everyone collectively agreed that it was fantastic.  2) The manager, Mike, went above and beyond to take care of our party.  He could not have been more personable  and helpful. 3) The staff was fantastic as well, and took care of the large party seamlessly.  They were friendly, efficient, brought out everything pretty quickly for such a large group, and it was all still hot.  And gave us separate checks - none of which were incorrect.  I really appreciate good service like that.  4) The general manager, Dan, was also awesome - and gave us a tour of Room 1812 downstairs (which I HIGHLY recommend for anyone who appreciates a pretty authentic speakeasy with top quality cocktails).  I'll definitely be going back soon.",

While I understand the restaurant is pretty new and still figuring everything out, we experienced many issues. The bar was backed up so by the time all 7 of us received our drinks, the ice was already melted making the drinks very watered down. 2 of the 7 girls at my table received their entrees 20 minutes after the other 5. Several of the meals were cold and/or weren't nearly as described as on the menu (ex. Seafood Greek Salad was basically squid and shrimp on top of a heaping of hummus - yuck). The salads were definitely overpriced for what you actually received. We also experienced issues with bills - some were charged for drinks and appetizer, others weren't at all. The waitress was very sweet but didn't seem to want to adjust the bills accordingly or comp the items she said would be. What was planned to be a 1.5 hr (max) dinner, took at least 2.5 hrs due to the very slow service and many issues we experienced. Overall, extremely disappointed. Sadly would not recommend. The spinach artichoke dip with pita bread, however, was the only thing I'd recommend about my experience there.",
