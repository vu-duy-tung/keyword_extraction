    "text": "Pupusas are my new BFF. Seriously. I never knew such deliciousness came from El Salvador! If you haven't had these spherical, stuffs of love then you should go get some. Now.   Yes, a bunch of hungry yelpers got together fora casual UYE to fill ourselves to the brim with pupusas, tamales, plantains, rice, beans, Jarritos, and so much more. Word to the wise - if you can speak a bit (or quite a bit) or Spanish, that will help you here. While the servers are very nice, there is a bit of a language barrier. However, as other yelpers have pointed out, the menu is in English and with the photos throughout the menu, you can easily point & order.   As mentioned, the pupusas are delicious. Try all three - they are only $1.50 each. Equally as tasty are the fried plantains and the fried corn tamale. The fried corn tamale tastes like the delicious baby of cornbread and a tamale, fried. It's heaven. The chicken tamale left a lot to be desired - it was like the sad, squishy cousin of the fried corn tamale. I'll skip the chicken tamale next time. Overall, you'll get a ton of value from your meal regardless of what you order.  The interior is simple, but lends itself to large parties of diners at a time. Frankly, as long as it's clean and I have somewhere remotely comfortable to sit, I don't care much what it looks like. I plan to work El Pulgarcito into my fave lunch spots - it's so tasty and so affordable!",

Wanting to taste the broadest swath of offerings. we started with a sampler plate (El Tapatio?).  Holy gluttony, Batman!  There was an ungodly amount of shrimp, beef, chicken, etc. on that plate!  All for a whopping $12.99!  Before we were done, we tasted all manor of papusas and tamales.  If I had just one dollar for every time I found myself saying, \"This stuff is just silly good!\", the meal would have been free!  When the check finally came, thanks to the aforementioned coupon, I was embarrassed to pay it.  I almost felt like a thief.  Gluttony may indeed be one of the seven deadly sins, but I will return to sin some more!!",

It's on Central Avenue, so parking is not an issue. And you won't have trouble seeing the restaurant from the road due to the neon signs all over the outside. The service was good but there was a bit of a language barrier, so if you don't speak Spanish, be sure to point to what you'd like on the menu (which has English translations, so no worries there). Decor was simple and the restaurant was clean.  At our table was an order of pupusas ($1.50 each), two orders of fajitas ($8.99 each), an order of tostadas ($6.99 for 3) and some fried plantains. The portion sizes were huge! I tried all the dishes and they were great - very authentic El Salvadorean deliciousness. And the pico de gallo was absolutely fantastic; we ended up asking for more it was so good.  This is a great place to meet a friend (or 10) for authentic food in a clean, customer friendly atmosphere.",

    "text": "Wow!  This a 4.5 star place.  Located far down Central Ave in an unassuming shopping center, El Pulgarcito is a savory and affordable sit down Salvadorian restaurant whipping up an extensive selection of treats like papusas, tamales, fried plantains and more.  I only had the opportunity to get the plantains (delicious), pork and cheese papusas (delicious times 2), and sampled some fried corn tamales (fried deliciousness).  I wanted to try every single heaping dish that passed by to some of the other tables.  The menu is pretty extensive - all kinds of meat and seafood options in huge value-sized proportions.  Interior is dinerish.  There is a lot of blue and cafeteria like tables and nothing extraordinary - but we don't need distractions from the wonderful food anyway.  Service was very quick and friendly.  The place is populated with staff and clientele that are native Spanish speakers, but you won't have much difficulty ordering - menu is in English with pictures and everything I saw looked good!",

But if you insist on gallivanting about, the mojarra frita (fried fish, honduran style) is an excellent, excellent choice. Fried crisp and whole with the eyes and all, served on the world's plumpest grains of rice with a side of crisp tostones sprinkled with coarse salt and a peppery, fresh salad. I ate my fill 3 separate times off this dish, for under 11 bucks. If you're a heat-lover, order the tamarind drink as the perfect cooling accompaniment. And the churrasco is pretty good too. I recently moved near Pulgarcito, and I'm not ashamed to say they will know my name.",

    "text": "Given the recent yelp love this place has received (and being in my fave zip code), I decided it was high time to give it a try.    Parking was tough to find, and it was busy but not too busy when we went inside. The waitress was a little distracted and missed my initial order for horchata (a cinnamon rice milk drink).  I finally did get it, and, like at Three Amigos, it just wasn't so great. Very grainy, and not the smooth creamy deliciousness that you seem to always get at joints in Chicago. So, a no-go on the horchata.    I then ordered two bean and one cheese pupusas.  The cheese one was much better than the bean, but, in general, they were m'eh. It's basically fried bread and beans covered in salsa, which, by it's very nature, is going to be good, but I wasn't over the moon about them.  I actually thought the tostones and the chicken tamales that my significant other ordered totally eclipsed the pupusas, and if I were to go back, I'd definitely stick with the tamales because you can't easily make them at home (although we sometimes try) and they are just so freaking delicious when they are made well.  So, this place was perfectly fine, but I'm in no hurry to go back.",

I soooooo *proudly* wrote the very first review for this place and have been recommending them since. I too went the first time based on a recommendation. NOT anymore due to our last takeout order.  To be nice: It. Was. Bad.   Four of us placed an order. The chicken enchiladas were diced up pieces of dried out chicken, rolled up in dried out tortillas, with a thick glob of cheap ass cheese, covered with the salsa rojo(so the menu says) which in reality, was canned hunts tomato sauce with some black pepper tossed in for good measure.Seriously, it was so obvious when I opened the container and \"that canned sauce smell\" slapped me in the face. My friend who ordered the very same thing, claims to have been slapped twice.   The beef fajitas were a takeout dish full of peppers and onions (where's da beef ? Oh there it is, pointing to about four slivers hiding under the P&O's ) we asked for corn tortillas and searching through the takeout for them I said \"Oh who ordered papusas\" NO ONE did! Those things, that were as thick as a papusas, were the corn tortillas for the fajitas. No thank you.   Good thing we ordered back up tacos. They're always good.  WRONG. Again, back to the *dried out * theme. Where's the garbage?  Even the salsas, green and the red, WAYYYY off.  I know places have their \"OFF NIGHTS \" but damn.   One thing that has not changed, unfortunately, is the use of little plastic baggies for the condiments on the takeout orders.",

    "text": "El Pulgarcito de America (the little thumb in Spanish) is not to be confused with the umpteen million Latin restaurants on Central Avenue.  Over the years of eating countless Mexican and Latin American dishes, I think I've become quite discerning of quality food. El Pulgarcito hits the mark!   At a recent Yelp! lunch event, I had the infamous pupusas.  Grilled tortilla patties with gooey pork and cheese filling.  Yum yum! At a $1.50 a piece, pupusas are best thing since tacos (maybe better).  They served them with 'curtido', spicy coleslaw, and I doused them a generous helping of salsa verde for extra kick.  Like my fellow Yelpers (Tiffany N. and Nicole W.), I was joneseing to come back and try the colossal platters that other passed by us as we ate.  The staff spoke decent English and were graceful with our Spanglish faux-pas as we attempted to order while pointing at colorful menu photos.  Luckily, no order was lost in translation.    Instead, our lunch party got far more than we were bargaining for.  What looked like a small plate of goodies ended up being a platter, resulting in the sharing fried tamales, fried plantains, chicken tacos with onion and cilantro...you get the picture.  Depsite the heaping plates, I don't think anyone paid more than $10 for their lunch.  El Pulgarcito is a virtually smorgasboard of Mexican and Central American food and culture.  The walls are covered with Latin kitsch, telenovelas are playing on the TV's, and yet the deer antlers remind you haven't left the South.  Take a seat, eat to your heart's delight, and stagger home stuffed!",

Second, get a bean and cheese papusa. And plantains. And any kind of kabob- they're all magnificent.   Third, expect everything to be about as fresh as it could possibly be.

I've not had the pleasure of eating Salvadorian/Honduran  food but this place provided me the chance to do just that.   I really enjoyed the papusas (cheese, bean/cheese, and pork). The bean and cheese were definitely the favorite out of the three, i'd skip the pork as I agree the meat is minced...not my thing.   We then split two meals the Camarones al Cilantro (shrimp, cream sauce, beans, rice, pico de gallo side salad) and Carne estilo Honduras ( char grilled steak with rice, beans, salad, avocado, pico de gallo). I found the shrimp to be a bit overcooked and the sauce heavy although overall flavor-wise it was good. I couldn't eat too much of this as it was super decadent.  The sides and accompaniments were good. The steak was the winner at our table. It is not a steakhouse so we were not asked what temp we wanted it cooked to. It was a chargrilled thin flank steak (close to well...I'm a rare girl usually)  but it had a ton of flavor and was awesome with a healthy dose of fresh lime juice. I'd get this next time.   Finally because we were nervous that we still had not reached our $35 limit (even with steak and shrimp) we split the flan. Flavor-wise it tasted good, cinnamony, though the toppings were lackluster (hersheys syrup and a defrosted strawberry.... sadface).   We also each had a modelo ..very refreshing and inexpensive at $3 a bottle.  As mentioned earlier knowing some Spanish would be helpful at this place...but we were able to order without any real issues.   I'll most likely return as it was pretty darn good and the price was right.",

Can you imagine those two things combined? You've just imagined the Tostones app served here. Only it gets better, because the 10 - 12 waffletains are swimming in salty Crema and pureed black beans, with a cube of tasty queso fresco hanging out for the hell of it. SICK delicious, and 4 bucks.  Uno mas amazing thing - vegetarian burrito - the ONLY burrito I've eaten in this town without picking up a fork and knife. All that was in there were tasty grilled veggies, red sauce, and rice, but it was mucho delicioso. Walking out into 89 degree weather afterwards sucked after eating this much cheese and grease, but we just cranked up the AC and mumbled happily to ourselves. Awesome.",

The veggie burrito was like eating veggie fajitas with rice...that give your taste buds a kick! The ingredients were fresh. The proportion was large and plenty enough to get you full.   It's not comparable to Mexican food. It's more Salvadorian: less cheese, refried beans, and not the typical salsa (less chunky, more liquidy). The service was very friendly and speak both English and Spanish. It seems the majority of the business was \"to go\" the night we went.   Definitely give it a try! Your taste buds and wallet will thank you.",

My daughter and I dropped in for dinner earlier this week based on Seth A's review. And I discovered that I'd been here before with my husband for lunch one Saturday.  My husband and I were thoroughly satisfied with our meals. I had the pupusas and don't remember what he had.   This week, my daughter got the (giant) chicken burrito and fell in love. I was mildly surprised because at Qdoba, she only gets the veggie burrito. When I asked her about it, she said the chicken at El Pulgarcito is juicier than Qdoba's. LOL  I wish I could say my chicken pupusas (with slaw) were good but I can't. (Insert sad face here.)  While my pupusas looked great on the outside (fried to a perfect golden brown), the inside left me puzzled.  When I cut into one, I saw no cheese, the \"chicken\" looked like some type of minced meat, and didn't taste like chicken. Not nasty but not what I expected.  I also ordered a side of fried plantain. Yum! I love plantain. The crema (sour cream), mashed red beans, and cheese on the plate were new to me. It was a gooooood combination with the so-so pupusas.   My daughter enjoyed my plantain platter as well. I can't get her to touch plantain at home.  Our meal with drinks (two Pepsis) came to $18 plus change.  Because I'm pretty sure I can get a better pupusa here, we'll go back again.  Stay tuned...",

    "text": "So I'm pretty dense.  I came fully intending to get pupusas because of all the hype on Yelp about them. I had never had one, after all, nor had I had Salvadorean food.  I went with a large group of 18 people and they were very accommodating with separate checks. The servers were a little overwhelmed, but very sweet and kept us straight (well our orders anyway).  The menu was about 4 pages long, and oddly, the Salvadorean section was only 1/3 of a page. In fact, I ordered the only Salvadorean \"combo\" which was called the Rico Combinacion. Conveniently, however, it was a mere $4.95 when my comrades were ordering $16 meals.  The menu also had a small breakfast section, a whole page on Honduran food, and a page on Mexican food. My not-so-adventurous colleagues got Honduran & Mexican items.  So my Rico combinacion included a chicken tamal, which had  sweetish corn filling with some shredded white meat chicken in the middle (3/5), and then a pupusa and a empanada. Enter denseness. I couldn't figure out which was the empanada and which was the pupusa. Or more correctly, I cut into the empanada expecting it was the pupusa. This was A) because i had never had a pupusa and didn't pay attention to the photos on here beforehand  2) all previously consumed empanadas I had ever had were meat, chicken or spinach filled and fried.  So I cut into the empanada and took a bite and was startled by the sweet plantain flavor, with a white filling. I still can't figure out what the pure white filling was, but after Googling, it seems it might have been a sweet milk/cornstarch mix.  Anyway not exactly what I expected. But it was nice, so I left it for dessert.  The pupusa was all it was cracked up to be. I had a bean & cheese one, and it wasn't at all overwhelmingly cheesy, so it was just as I liked it (5/5).  I definitely could have some cravings of these. Simple, but perfect.  As someone else mentioned, the slaw was spicy, but to my delight, it did not have cilantro in it (my vomit-inducing kryptonite). A perfect complement to the otherwise mild meal.  (5/5) I was surprised that there wasn't more heat to the tamal especially, but perhaps Salvadorean food is similar to Somalian food in that it's just kinda mild.  That said, my friend Julie ordered the Shrimp El Diablo and it was 4 alarm hot.   I returned to the plantain empanada for dessert, and along with my Tecate with lime, I was a full girl, all for $8. Now that's a deal.  I would definitely return to try out some Honduran food next time, but starting w/ a pupusa! Aye papi!",

Warm, gooey and when you looked under the hood, the combination of beans and cheese living in bliss (and soon my belly) was a heavenly sight.  The only issue? I kept having food envy as the waitresses brought out other tables dishes which then made me question the pupusas. So that means I must go back and have some platter of yummy, ethnic goodness for 8 bones or so, I can do that.  I like the decorative deer heads on the wall. I kinda wanted to go up there and hang my pupusas on the antlers......instead I ate them.  4 items and my bill was under $7--holla if ya nasty!",

Talk about $1.50, let me order 27. It's quite the bargain $12 check average and we pigged.  I was eyeing every other customers food, they served a shrimp cocktail in a deep glass with salsa and avocados on the bottom, I saw the guy put hot sauce on his shrimp and I wanted to crawl over Julia S. and go sit with them.

    "text": "We first found out about El Pulgarcito through a GroupOn they had a while back and since I am always on the look out for any type of Carribean/Mexican/Central/South American food I was really excited to find this delicious Salvadoran spot. When driving down Central I usually stop at Three Amigos, so if it wasn't for the GroupOn I don't think I would've ever made it far enough to find this place.  Let me just start off by saying that we had to spend $35 for the deal, and between just two people it is nearly impossible to do that at this place. What made it even more difficult is the fact that they had a whole fried fish on special for $6.99 that day and I can never say no to fried fish when it comes whole! It came with a salad, rice, refried beans, and a homemade salsa and it was TO DIE FOR! This is the type of food us immigrants seek in the U.S. because one bite and we are instantly transported to a beach somewhere back in our country (mine is Venezuela!).   I don't remember what my husband ate, but we did get several types of pupusas, tacos, empanadas and other sides as well. I felt like we were at one of those Brazilian steakhouses where the food just keeps showing up at your table because to reach $35 we had to just keep ordering A LOT! Needless to say, we both went into food comas and were completely worthless the rest of the day, but it was totally worth it.   This is a really great place to try too because it has a huge variety of offering, not just Salvadoran food, but Mexican as well. They also have pictures on the menu so if you're not familiar with a specific dish it is easy to order from the pictures. El Pulgarcito offers friendly service and delicious food at incredibly low prices, there's not much else I look for in a restaurant!",

    "text": "This is actually one of my favorite Latin restaurants in the area. The only reason for the 4 stars is you really have to watch with breakfast because they will often cook even sunny-side-up eggs to death so make sure you're very clear if you want them cooked medium or less. And I'm a real egg freak...   I've been to this restaurant several times and ordered a variety of items. The Platillo Guanaco will satisfy even the hungriest carnivore with a protein urge, while the seafood soup will almost make you cry it's so good! Oh and for breakfast it's excellent here- with a delicious green salsa for huevos rancheros (but heed the previous egg warning well). If you're used to the thin Mexican style tortillas these are really very thick and may surprise you, but they are very good. Also they have agua de jamaica, and I can never say no to that.   If you don't speak Spanish it can be a challenge here, but well worth a little confusion. I speak Spanish and there has been occasional confusion anyway, but they always jump to fix anything that you think might have gone wrong with your order. Parking can be a real challenge as their lot is frequently full (a sign of how good it is), but like the occasional order confusion it's still very worth it.  The prices here are a real bargain. I think another reviewer mentioned having to get a table-full just to be able to use their Groupon and that is about right. This place will definitely not kill your budget, all while serving surprisingly well-executed and extremely large dishes. When I order a Platillo Guanaco (the chicharron is pretty dry though, so I skip it and get more steak) I have 1/4 to 1/3 of it in the restaurant before I'm full, taking the rest home for 2-3 more meals.",

We normaly order the bean and cheese pupusas, carne asada tacos, carnitas tacos and chicken tacos, and all are pretty good. Their green salsa is delicious and Carne Asada quesadilla is good too.   With $26 you can feed 4 people- the prices are pretty reasonable.  We are regulars here. The food is great and pretty authentic--- A must try if you want to venture down Central Ave.",

Dishes are huge and come with all kinds of things (beyond rice and beans you can get yuca, plantain and other sides). Food here is a bit heavier and not quite as fresh-tasting as Three Amigos' is, but still good.  The options here are bigger and while you can get fajitas and burritos, they also have other dishes like seafood soups and all kinds of entrees.   It's very cheap, especially considering regular menu items seem to be on special occasionally - same dish, lower price, such as chicken and veg fajitas for 6.99 recently. (Great option, at least veggie fajitas here doesn't just mean onions and peppers but also squash, broccoli, etc.)",

    "text": "\"El Pulgarcito\" apparently means \"little thumb,\" but more specifically \"Tom Thumb.\"  And \"El Pulgarcito de America\" refers to El Salvador, which is what this humble restaurant's food is mostly about.    The wife and I live in Cincinnati, a metro that apparently has zero Salvadoran food.  But I'm a fan of this cuisine, if not a very knowledgeable one, so I'll often jump at the chance to have some when on the road.  Luckily, my brother, who lives in Charlotte, likes it, too, so off we went.  El Pulgarcito is a rangy diner-style restaurant on Central Avenue, and it offers superb value for the money.  A plate of three sizeable pupusas (all different) and a large plate of fried plantains (served with thin refried beans and sour cream) set me back less than ten bucks, and was solid, if unspectacular eating.  (The pupusas were slightly mushy, and neither the best nor the worst I've had.)  My brother had this giant whole fried fish that he said was quite good; that entree was only 12 dollars or so.  The menu has a pretty large Mexican section in addition to the Salvadoran specialties.  Most of the locals seemed to be having big bowls of soup, so that seems to be the way to go here.    Service was efficient enough, even if the staff weren't exactly rays of sunshine on this evening.",

I knew this was a place I had to try.  I wasn't even hungry, so I was happy to see they had some cheap options.  I instantly knew what to order from a place like this.  Some $1.50 papusas and a tamale.  All came out quick, hot, and quite tasty.  I kind of wondered where my salsa's were, but apparently they had forgotten, as the apologized quickly once they saw the puzzled look on my face.  Service was so-so, maybe there was a little language barrier, but that was my only complaint.  The food was great per $.  Also, I certainly don't mind the location, but those that are used to the southpark area might feel a little uneasy later in the eve.",

They only serve beer for their alcohol selection so I only got water. I had the papapus bean and pork. It's the best I've tasted in this area.  I appreciated the waitress coming by seems like every 5 minutes to each table with a smile and asking if everything was ok. They have tv and the place is a nice size. I will definitely come back and being hubby next time. The traffic on this side of town is pretty hectic but it's worth the drive.",

Great menu which needs a few more visits for me to get a good handle on it . . . no problemo!   The food was fresh, fast, and tasty (although I thought the plantains were overcooked).  Nice variety on the plate, and a refreshing departure from rice-n-beans.  Diner-style layout.  Family friendly.  Credit cards accepted.  Give 'em a whirl!",

They all help each other.  The food was excellent too.  I got the veggie burrito done my way and she was super cool about making it just with the ingredients that I wanted.  The horchata was delicious! Make sure to try it.  I just wished they made pupusas with just beans.  I would def come back.",
