My wife and I dropped by around 10 a.m on Sunday & ordered eggs, crisp bacon, sausage, toast, home fries, & coffee! Everything delivered was fresh, hot, & properly cooked & served. The meals for both of us cost about $17.50. We could not ask for a better breakfast.  Brooklyn Pizza is tops in my book for a really good meal !!",

    "text": "So disappointing. We arrived at 8:30 on a Friday night and there were 3 customers at one table and about 5 staff out on the floor. They were cleaning the floors even though they are open until 10. I have a gluten allergy and I've had their gluten free pizza recently as take-out, and it was decent. I learned that they have gluten free penne, so I ordered the primavera with grilled chicken. It arrived on a big plate with a huge serving of pasta, lots of veggies, and 2 good size chicken breasts. Problem is, the pasta was undercooked and hard, the whole plate was swimming in a butter/water bath, and yet the chicken on top was dry. I tried mixing it together but the plate was so full, I couldn't. There was really no flavor to the chicken or the pasta and the vegetables were just awful, mushy and bland. My husband got the linguini alfredo which looked very unappealing. He ate a little and decided he would take it home and 'fix it' to make it taste better later. I honestly didn't even want mine; I tried. So, I went up and ordered myself a gluten free pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni, and extra cheese. I ate a dinner salad, which was a good mix of greens and shredded carrots, a little cucumber and tomato. The house dressing was good, but they give a small portion. My husband ordered a pinwheel (cheese and pepperoni wrapped in dough, which he liked a lot. My pizza was good, but I was tired by the time it arrived, so I had a piece and took the rest home. Overall, it was a pretty poor experience. I wouldn't bother dining in and I certainly won't try anything other than the pizza. Hope this helps!",

    "text": "I was very disappointed on my last visit.  The young girl who took our order made a mistake keying in our order.  No problem, not a big deal.  When we sat down my wife asked about the total we were charged and it seemed high.  We totaled it up in our heads and it seemed like we had been overcharged.  I asked a waitress to ask a manager to come to the table.  The manager came over and we told him that we thought we had been overcharged.  He was very arrogant, rude and belligerent.  He reluctantly took our check behind the counter and came back a few minutes later.  He told us that the order had been rang up wrong but that we had not been charged for a side salad and that we actually owed money.  And, he was a real jerk about it. But, the more I thought about it the angrier I got.  I asked a waitress for a pen and a menu.  I told her how big of a jerk the manager was and she agreed commenting that he was the owners brother. I added up what we had gotten and it was obvious that we had been overcharged.  I asked another waitress if the owner or another manager was there.  She told me that another manager was there, so I asked that she come over to our table.  I told her what had happened and showed her my receipt.  She went behind the counter, totaled it up and I saw her show the \"jerk\" manager the total.  She came back to our table and apologized.  She said we had been overcharged and she needed my credit card to refund our money for the overcharge.  Turns out that we had been overcharged by about $4.00.  The arrogant, rude manager never came back to apologize or anything.  What he didn't realize is that my wife and daughter along with many moms and daughters from my daughters dance studio frequently visit the restaurant after dance on Saturdays.  It would be safe to say that they spent collectively several thousand dollars there last year.  Because of his horrible attitude and lack of customer service he may have traded $4.00 and an apology for thousands of dollars in future revenue.  I will not EVER go back.  The pizza was good but it's also good at Portofinos and Bella Fresco down the street.  If the owner allows his brother to treat customers like this it is only a matter of time and this place will be history.  I also sensed from the employees that this guy was a real jackass to work for.  It's a shame that a place with so many good things going for it has such bad management.",

    "text": "So I've noticed quite a few excellent reviews on this place, however I'm probably not going to make the authors very happy!! In all honesty I'd rate this place 2.5. I should rate them a 1 considering my friend ended up with food poisoning however I did not so 2.5 it is!!   I ordered a slice of pepperoni/mushroom pizza and the zucchini sticks. The pizza was alright, not great. It wasn't really hot and I could tell all they did was take a slice of pepperoni and throw some mushrooms on it before halfway heating it up. They pretty much all fell off as the cheese wasn't even melted enough to make them stick. The taste would have been there had it been a fresh pizza made to order I think. My crust was hard as a rock due to sitting for so long and the halfway reheat.  I will say however the zucchini sticks were awesome, absolutely loved those but zucchini is my favorite vegetable!! The Marinara dipping sauce for them was watery, cold, and lacking in spice/flavor.  Maybe we went at a bad time, or maybe the trick is to order an entire pizza (that isn't pre-made).  I really want to believe that I hit this place on a bad afternoon so I will be back to try them again (if only to get the zucchini sticks... did I mention they were good!!)  I'll review again at that time and hope I don't end up with the same fate my friend did!!",

Being the sweet soul that I am, I tagged along one day with my husband and little boy (resigned to have a salad). Much to my surprise, they had a sign on the counter now offering GF personal pies! Obviously I was elated, and ordered a personal hawaiian (my favorite). IT. TASTED. JUST. LIKE. THE. REGULAR!! Seriously delicious. For everyone out there with Celiac, let them know that you have the disease and they will make sure your pizza does not have contact with any wheat flour.

I take a glimpse at the pizzas and see they're only half baked, kind of makes sense when you have little traffic and the stuff may sit around for hours. The downside is that they take longer to heat up but that didn't bother me.  What bothered me is that when the pizza slices arrived the crust was tasted and felt like cardboard, there weren't anywhere cheesy enough, and I didn't like the toppings one bit. The sausage and ham were sliced and chopped to the size of confetti, the vegetarian slice was overwhelmed by a load of under-cooked peppers    NY pizza, this? I've had better pizza at the food court of shopping malls. Since pies are baked to order , very possibly they're not that bad but as far as slices go , meh I've had a LOT better.",

We tried the nonna pizza & it was a good choice for us. Simple but tasty. We also tried their zucchini sticks which were very yummy! I love that they were more tempura battered. So good! I look forward to our return.",

    "text": "This pizza place is the closest thing to NY.  Don't get me wrong, the feel of the place does not make you forget that you are in Charlotte and are eating at some local pizza joint in Queens or Brooklyn.  But if you close your eyes and use a bit of imagination, you might think you are! Yes, the pizza is that good.  Being a home-grown NY guy,  I can say that I'm lucky to have had the best pizza in the country whenever I wanted.  Now that I'm in Charlotte (and anywhere else for that matter), good pizza is hard to come by.  Besides your run-of-the-mill Pizza chains like Pizza Hut and Dominoes (all of which I am not a fan of), I think the best pizza places are those which you can grab a quick bite to eat.  In NY, we refer to these joints as \"street corner\" pizza places.  BK Pizza Parlor is that type of place - but also has the feel of a restaurant.    I had the regular cheese pizza - no need to get all fancy.  The crispy crust, tasty sauce, and whopping amounts of gooey cheese made this place the best pizza place i have had in Charlotte.  I definitely recommend!",

We ordered our food at approximately 8:30 pm, with the restaurant having a closing time of 9 pm. Sadly, the employees at Brooklyn pizza didn't care that we had spent $70 in their restaurant, all they cared about was escorting us out the door as soon as closing time hit. We were denied drink refills at nine and the servers were unwilling to allow us to finish eating. They began clearing our table as we were still eating, and not in a nice, polite way. They were clearly done having us in their restaurant, and we were not loitering, we were simply trying to finish the food we had ordered.   This is a note for you to beware, if you happen to show up close to closing time expecting pleasant employees and a decent experience, you'll be disappointed. Customer service was severely lacking, and although the pizza wasn't bad, there are other establishments in Charlotte who most certainly will welcome our business, and I would expect, treat us with respect, unlike at Brooklyn Pizza. It just isn't good enough to be denied the courtesy of being allowed to finish eating the food that we paid for. Unbelievably RUDE employees and food that is just not worth the bad experience that came with it.",

The low quality sauce and cheese they use left the crust of the pizza oily and slimy. We asked the waitress to look at the pizza - she said that's how it comes out. Lol. Horrible. We asked for the pizza to be put back in the oven. Eh 5 mins later - same - now more burned pizza with a still raw crust came out. Instead of being a problem we ate this crappy \"Brooklyn\" pizza.

Stumbled upon this place to get pizza, and figured they would have the game on since they claim to be very New York with their name and decor.  No NY games showing.  What came out of this was having THE BEST pizza ever at Brooklyn Pizza.  I'm a native New Yorker and 90% of the places in NY don't even compare to the great taste and flavor as this.  The pie also came out super hot, which burns the roof of your mouth.    Later in the week, we got pizza and wings to go.  The quality suffers from eating the pizza at home.  Plain wings were over fried and seemed day-old. Sauced up wings were \"eh\".  Stay in at Brooklyn Pizza and eat here instead.  Saves the clean up!",

So long that they pretty much know our order and special topping requests.   5 star for food quality and promptness in service. Pizza Nonna is my favorite and its crusty edges and soft base is good. Their sauce is flavorful and definitely made fresh. We have tried once to get to-go order but the experience is much better dine-in.",

    "text": "Surprised I have not rated this excellent pizza place as we have been regulars for years.  Funny how that happens.  They really have great pies.  Yeasty dough, not thick and not cracker thin, but just right.  Tomato sauce with flavor and even a cheese pizza is special.  Have yet to get out of our rut to try Stromboli and other such items, but did \"get out there\" to do their penne vodka and it was GREAT!    Oh Lord...does this mean that I will be in a decision loop trying to decide on which one each time?  Or will I just get both and split them with wife?  Full bar, lots of room and you regularly see kid athletic teams having their parties there.  Fits right in without a problem.    Take-out is normal and those pies stay hot for quite some time.  And pizza is great for breakfast with just a microwave heat-up.  New Yorkers will poo-poo anything, regardless of flavor and quality unless it is made in \"The City\" so ignore them and enjoy Brooklyn Pizza as it is REALLY good.",

After, talking to my server she explained that she did not know what happen but that she was sorry about it. Once i left the restaurant i call and spoke to Amanda who plainly told me that she was sorry as well. I do not know about everyone else but if i pay for something i expect to get it. Do not try the Calzone or try to add the extra items in it. You will be disappointed and the manager will not be bother with what you had to say.",

    "text": "Yum!  This was my first visit to Brooklyn Pizza Parlor, and it won't be my last.  I was impressed at how BIG the restaurant is, how nicely decorated it is, and how it's not just your typical \"big room\" restaurant.  There are several types of tables, with divisions throughout (including a fireplace right in the middle of the room), so you can feel like you're getting some privacy no matter where you sit.    You order at the counter and then they bring your food out to you when it's ready.  There are many menu choices besides pizza (although you can buy it by the slice or by the pie), including sandwiches, salads, and pasta.  This first time, we opted for the pizza.  We split a \"Meatza\" Pizza and a White Pizza, which are just what you'd expect by their names.  Both were delicious and came out fresh and hot.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  Even though we just ordered waters, many people stopped by at different times to see if we needed refills.    Brooklyn Pizza Parlor is a casual dining restaurant, yet it feels nicer than a lot of casual dining restaurants.  Best of all, Santa Claus was in the next booth over with a pizza, so you know it has to be good!",

    "text": "The pizza at Brooklyn is outstanding. 5 stars.  Unfortunately, this review is NOT about the food. I called in an order for a pizza on a Friday night at around 6:15pm. Understandably, they were very busy. I expected this before ordering, which is why my first question when I called was \"How long would a take-out pizza take at this time?\" The woman answered with \"about 30 minutes\". Cool, I thought, because I live in Fort Mill and I figured it would take me about 20-25 minutes to get there. I placed my order and jumped in the car to go get it.  If you've never been to Brooklyn Pizza, when you walk in there's a place to order food to eat there and a separate counter to pick up 'to go' orders. When I arrived, there wasn't a single person in line to order 'eat-in' food and there was 13 people in the the 'to go' line. I actually had to ask the people ahead of me \"did you all order to go?\", because I thought some of them might have been confused as to how the lines worked. Nope, they knew.  Each person ahead of me stepped up to the counter one at a time, told the person their name, paid for their food and either got it or waited. Now, here's my problem with that. When I arrived, it was almost exactly 30 minutes from when I ordered. It took me almost 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. At least 4 people ahead of me paid for their food and it wasn't even ready for them yet, which tells me that they ordered AFTER I did. And the people that did get their food as soon as they paid had to wait about a minute each for the ONE person working the counter to run their credit card and then walk all the way back to get their food.  Here's where they're failing, in my opinion. 1) When there is no one in line to order food to eat in the restaurant, the other 'cashiers' should invite people from the 'to go' line over to their registers to help move the line faster. Or 2) Someone should be walking the 'to go' line and asking the people that are 3 or 4 deep for their names so that they can go back into the kitchen to check on the status of their orders, that way, when they make it to the front of the line, their food is ready to be carried out so that the 'to go' cashier doesn't have to hold up the line because they're spending time in the kitchen. Or 3) When to go orders are ready, they should call out the name on that order and let that person come to the front of the line to pay and go. No one should have to wait for people that ordered after them to pay and then wait for their food. Paying first shouldn't be the priority, ordering first should. Or 4) They need to get a food warmer that sits in their 'to go' area so that when you pay for your food it is right there ready to go and you don't have to wait, like I did, for about a full minute for the woman to go get my pizza. I understand it sounds like nit-picking when we're talking about a minute or less, but when you add that up over 15-20 customers, that's a long time.  So, in summary, here's the deal. I absolutely love the pizza from Brooklyn and I wish there was another location closer to where I live. I think they'd do exceptionally well with a third location in the the Fort Mill/Rock Hill area, because the pizza around here is not all that great. However, their 'to go' system is flawed, at least at the Colony Rd. location. Perhaps, I caught them on a bad night. But, when I overheard the two women ahead of me in line discussing how they always have to wait to get 'to go' orders, with the one even suggesting that the other pre-heat her oven at home before she leaves to get her pizza, I have to believe this is a regular thing. When I finally got my pizza and was leaving, I took a pic of all the people in the 'to go' line and I felt sorry for them. There was at least 10 people that probably had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get their order. Had I known how their current system works, I would have ordered while sitting in my car in the parking lot and then walked in to stand in line for 15 minutes, paid for my food, and then waited a little longer for my order. If that's what they expect customers to do, then I imagine a lot of business is turned away because of it. I truly hope they can figure out a way to make this system better, because their product is great. I want them to succeed. Good luck Brooklyn Pizza.",

Two Sicilian slices usually come out to under $6...which is a steal as far as local pizza goes.  There are waits for take-out ordering at times, but in the end it is worth it.  The owner frequently checks on customers to see how they're enjoying their food, which is always plus. If i tried more than the Sicilian & Margherita pizzas on the menu - and if they renovated their seating areas and decor - then I would feel more compelled to give 5 stars.  Looking forward to my next visit.",

The concept was a little different from other pizza places we've been to - you order at the front counter and find a table and they bring your order to you.  They do come around and help with refills, etc.    The pizza was very good!  Definitely on-point NY Style pizza.  We ordered a pepperoni pie and it was excellent.  Very greasy, but I'm one of those people who like it that way.  We also ordered garlic knots and they were delicious as well.    I'm giving them 4 stars instead of five because when we came in, it took a few minutes for the guy behind the counter to acknowledge us.  We asked one of the girls who was walking around if she could help take our order and she couldn't.  It wasn't the best welcome, but as they say patience is a virtue and our patience paid off with a yummy dinner.  The leftover pizza was just as good!  This place is definitely worth a try and we will be back when we are craving pizza!",

I ordered one \"meatza\" pizza and a cheese pizza.  The sauce was mildly sweet and the crust was chewy, slightly thicker than my preference.  The cheese had good flavors while the meats were generally less flavorful than the best in the area.  If Domino's is a \"C\" pizza, then Brooklyn is a \"B+\".  Much better than average, but not quite in the league with the best in these parts.  At the price, I'll look elsewhere for my next pizza fix, while not regretting my long deferred choice.",

We were going to ask the lady behind the counter what they were, but when we were finishing up our meal the next customers after us came into the restaurant, forming a line at the counter, so my friend goes over to ask the guy working in the kitchen, what exactly are rice balls?

Also I  ordered the pizza online and by the time I got there my pie was ready. They also had a legit  box of Italian cookies that I deprived my self of.",

We are vegetarians, we do not eat chicken or meat. We have always ordered meatless selections. On a few occasions, the staff has made an error and served us meals with meat. The staff has apologized and made the correction. I called in a large order last night. Everything I ordered was meatless. When I came to pick it up, I reiterated directly to the staff member giving me my boxed and bagged order, \"There is no meat?\" The staff member responded sharply, \"Nothing you ordered has meat.\" When I got home and opened the pizza box, instead of a cheese pizza, it was pepperoni. I called and told them what happened. I drove back and make the exchange. They gave me a $30 store credit. I thought it was fair. By the time I got back home, my family had already eaten. I took one bite of my now cool Eggplant Parmesan. It was chicken. I called the shop again. This time they told me they were busy and I would have to hold.  I hung up.  I will not be using the $30 store credit.",

It is by no means our favorite spot for pizza, but I won't soil this review with the names of other places that we frequent more often, so on to my thoughts.  Up side: - Buffalo Chicken pizza and White pizza * are quite good - Salads, especially the Caesar, are large and they don't skimp on toppings - Fettucine Alfredo, if you add chicken and bacon, is filling and tasty - The owners clearly care about the business, keep it clean, and are onsite all the time - Prices are average to low, so the whole family can go out to eat, or pick up dinner to bring home, without breaking the bank  Down Side: - Counter service: cafeteria style, no table service to speak of. Order at the counter, grab a flag, someone brings your food. Most of the food comes on paper plates with plastic utensils - The place is run mostly by high-school teenagers, and while they are trying, the floor service is mediocre simply due to lack of experience - One of the two doors to the place is ALWAYS locked - with no sign to indicate this. I'm convinced the do this to entertain themselves as people slam into the unmoving door expecting it to open... - * The pizza is almost always undercooked, greasy, and doughy. Also fairly bland and aside from being thin, not very New York-like. A good NY pizza has a somewhat crispy bottom to the crust, never had that here, sadly - The place is popular with local families especially, so expect long wait times for both in-house and to-go food during busy periods, especially Friday evenings  We'll return, but mostly because its convenient, inexpensive, and the food is passable.",

Excellent creativity on the menu (even if some of the combos don't come off all that well, they get serious points for sticking their necks out and trying).    Great spot for young families.  If you're going on  Friday night you had better be there before 6pm -- the parking area can be cramped and this place can be really busy ... so plan ahead even if you are only doing carry-out.
