    "text": "This place needs a little TLC.  Let me start by saying I am a Fuel Pizza fan. The pizza is good and I love a place where I can get garlic knots! You can order by the slice or a whole pie and most locations are open late night ( hello convenience!).  Unfortunately this location is starting to slack... The last few times I've put in an order for pick-up, the orders weren't ready for the time I was quoted so I had to sit around in the dining room watching everyone else enjoy delicious pizza while I waited for my pizza to cook. To make matters worse, usually the staff has been preoccupied chatting with each other instead of packaging the order as soon as the pizza is out of the oven.  Then I tried delivery. Ordered 6 knots and a medium cheese pizza on a Monday night. Was quoted 45 mins for delivery but the pizza didn't arrive until over an hour after it was ordered. The pizza was cold and only 3 knots made it to my door (instead of 6 as ordered). Of course the delivery guy scurried back to his getaway vehicle before we realized the pizza was cold. Darn.  I hope the management notices and they turn this place around because I'd hate to have to take my business elsewhere. I guess only time will tell....",

    "text": "I don't know what all the hype is over this place because I was not impressed at all. I was really wanting pizza-mind you I'm gluten intolerant so that is not an easy thing to do. At least not a good pizza. Since this is in my neighborhood and got good reviews I thought I would give it a try. The crust wasn't bad, a little under cooked but not the worst one I have had, just too soft. I ordered the vegetarian pizza. It was pretty bland, not much cheese. I was wondering why they were skimping on my cheese-pizza and cheese go hand in hand, so where was my cheese? Most of my crust was bare naked-no toppings or cheese. I had to add a bunch of red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese to give it some flavor. I was very disappointed since this 12\"(the only size for gluten free crust)with a tea cost me $19. I could have gotten a better gluten free pizza at Dominos-and probably saved a few bucks.",

So since I lived down the street I decided to drive up there. I wanted to order some wings and the guy proceeds to tell me they're not frying anything else that night ( this was an hour before they closed ) so I said ok.... And proceeded to order a regular sized pizza pie. A girl walked up and said they're not doing any more pies for the night. So I then asked.... \"What do you guys do then?\" ... They said I could get a slice from one of the pies already prepared. (They looked like they had been sitting for a couple hours now) I walked out the door and left. I've never received service that was worse than this. I use to work at the fuel pizza in Davidson and I know how the store works. This would have never happened at the location I worked at. I don't know any other restaurant that denies business an hour before close. I am a regular at this location and there have been many times I've received bad service here, but this time, I will never be returning to this location again, and will be saying something to Jeremy (owner) about these employees!!",

    "text": "I really hate to be writing a negative review of a place that I had full intention of going in and thoroughly enjoying.  Some of my extended family came down to the \"big\" city from Mooresville so I figured we could check out Fuel Pizza since I also had a coupon.    Since it was my first time, I was a little bit disoriented by the menu since you have to order before taking your seat.  We were able to pull our tables together and sit by the window, which was nice.  The garlic knots are also very tasty.  My problem is with the pizza.  I ordered my favorite pizza as always, a cheese pizza with garlic and onions.  The pizza looked OK, although the toppings were very minimal.  I couldn't really see the garlic, and the onions were mostly burnt and too thin to have much onion flavor.  All of these problems would've been OK, if the pizza tasted good, but I couldn't honestly taste \"anything\" when biting into it.  I could taste a little bit of the garlic, but since that wasn't freshly chopped it was not a pleasant taste.  The crust was OK, but also not that special, and there wasn't really enough sauce to taste it at all.  I'm from the Northeast so I definitely like my thin crust pizza, but this wasn't at all what I had hoped for.  The buffalo wings were OK, but didn't have enough sauce to provide much flavor or heat.  The people were nice enough and the location in Plaza-Midwood is very cool as well so I didn't leave feeling upset or anything, but I'm not in a big rush to go back either.",

It's a pretty neat little place but like Julia said, it's more about the convenience than the quality. The food is fast and easy, which is what you are looking for late at night. And on a hungry alcohol stomach nothing tastes better than pizza.  Food was cheap: 2 slices and 13 garlic knots for $11. If I had to do it again, I'd skip the knots. They were tougher than expected. I suspect that there is better food to be had on this street. I'll be back to confirm that shortly.",

The crust was the perfect thickness, a little thinner than most with a touch of crispiness. The sauce was awesome - loved the herbs in it, the cheese was nicely melted and the pepperoni and mushrooms were plentiful. I ate four slices of the large pizza - I topped it with alot of red pepper flakes and grated parmesan. I meant to take a picture, but the pizza did not last long.   We sat outside too b/c the weather was so nice. Great location, except for the homeless people asking for cash for bus fare.   I AM going back....often!",

The knots were great - much softer than I thought they'd be. As a previous review said, it does get warm in here so dress in layers if it's a cold day. One server jumped up and opened the garage door on the front to air it out. No worries though, it's screened in. I'll definitely be back!",

Either way the past few times I've ordered delivery its been wrong or I paid extra for toppings and they weren't there I don't know how I pay $13 for toppings and a calzone and it comes out looking like a slice of pizza that was burnt outside and somehow at the same time under cooked on the inside it was absolutely ridiculous. 5 toppings and when I dissected it like a lab experiment because I couldn't believe how small it was there was barely anything on the inside at all and I mean like one or two of the toppings I asked for. I'm not ever going to eat here again unless I'm out with friends and they all want to go in then I will probably just get a coke and be charged too much for that somehow or there will be a roach floating in it barf.",

The crust is the proper thickness and consistency. The sauce is seasoned but not to an extreme. The cheese is nice and melty. There is red pepper flake and garlic powder on the tables (There is also grated cheese but I refuse to acknowledge that it has any right being on a slice). The garlic knots will give you breath to knock out a dog (this is a desired result). There is a respectable beer selection to wet your whistle. And most importantly, very most importantly, they are perfect folding slices.  They are open nice and late so Fuel is great for a post-bar food fix. If you are getting delivery (because sometimes you just don't want to have to put on pants to get delicious pizza) I highly suggest the online ordering for ease and convenience.",

I'm a fan of the veggie slice, which is on a really good whole wheat crust. Fuel also has excellent cookies, and they'll warm them up for you in the pizza oven.   The Central Ave location has the usual tattooed, hip crowd. The staff are all casual and friendly, and I like the kids' art on the walls. The outdoor area is in a fantastic part of town for people-watching, so I usually opt to sit outside. While the Trade St. location is nice for lunch breaks, the Central Avenue spot isn't too far away from the center of town, and it boasts its own parking lot, which is often the tipping point for me.   You can't go wrong with Fuel, in my opinion. What they lack in pizza perfection, they make up for in warm cookies, cool staff, and parking convenience.",

    "text": "Fuel Pizza is just OK.  I've ordered it quite a few times, and it is probably one of the better places to get pizza here.  I grew up in the Midwest, where you could get Chicago style pizza a lot of places.  I had a lot of great pizza there and in Chicago, which has made me very, very picky about good pizza.    As far as I can tell, the only crust you can get here is hand-tossed.  The crust itself is pretty decent.  It holds up pretty well to the toppings, and it has the right level of chewiness that a hand-tossed pizza should have, although the flavor is a little blah.  The sauce isn't too sweet, which I like, but it doesn't have enough flavor to set it apartment from other pizza sauces.  The 'Veggie on Wheat' and 'The Whole Engine' are the best pizzas they have.    A lot of people seem to like their wings, but I thought they were disappointing.  I've tried both their actual wings and their boneless (which is basically chicken strips covered in sauce).  They don't do any cooking of the wings with the sauce; they just pour the sauce over them afterwards.  While the sauce is good, it really doesn't impart much flavor to the chicken itself.  But I admit it - I am kind of a wing snob.  Their garlic knots are just OK as well.  They don't have enough garlic flavor for my taste.  They also have salads, subs, stromboli, and calzones on their menu, none of which I've had yet.  They also offer desserts, via cinnamon knots, Brad's cupcakes, and cookies.  I've also not tried any of those.  They do have relatively quick delivery, and their take-out time is pretty reasonable as well.  Their prices are decent as well.  So, if you're looking for fast, relatively cheap pizza, this is a good place.",

You are basically paying for cardboard crust with toppings. Wings really are good if they get the order right. But just had to throw in the towel and give up on them. 4 of the last 5 times we ordered from the central ave location it was either bad, not what we ordered, did not even have our order one time, one time it was correct but again pizza was subpar and the last time I went to pick it the delivery guy had taken it by mistake. Done with them. Way too many options out there to deal with Fuel Pizza. They need a manager who can expo.",

Flavorful crust that wasn't too chewy, smartly seasoned sauce, and fresh toppings. I had to figure out where it was from...and I've been stopping in for a slice (and those addictive garlic knots!) when I'm around ever since.  On my most recent visit to the Central Ave Fuel, the staff was incredibly kind and quick, especially considering it was the tail end of the dinner rush. Turns out I was mistakenly overcharged - I didn't notice. But the girl at the register found me at our table, asked if I'd like a refund or the extra piece I paid for, and threw in a cookie for the confusion! Honesty and great service!  The only thing on the menu I haven't tried yet are their take-and-bake pizzas. If they are anything like the stuff you get in the restaurant, I may be in trouble...",

My husband and I visited them tonight, a Friday evening around 7pm.  He has never been there before and I, being a pizza snob, said it was great before and for him to order any kind of pizza.  We ordered a 19\" Hawaiian pizza, add chicken and jalapenos.  To go.  The cashier, nor anyone else, ever even spoke to us tonight except to say \"for here or to go?\". We waited about 15 minutes, which was a short time to wait for hand made pizza, so that was a plus.  We were in a hurry to get home so we only glanced at the pizza before wet left.  When we arrived home and each grabbed a slice we were both very disappointed.  If we were still there we would sent the pizza back.  The pizza has an extremely minimal amount of cheese, we think.  Neither of us could find any so we are only assuming there is cheese on it.   The sauce was ON TOP of the cheese, then the toppings.  Ass backwards.  Because they put the cheese directly onto the bread, if at all, then the sauce, then the toppings the toppings were all dry, much like dog or cat food.  This was an extremely poor execution of pizza.  I REFUSE to eat Domino's or Pizza Hut or Little Caesar's, however, on this occasion, any of these would be a much better choice.  If you are looking for great pizza and friendly staff, this is NOT the place.  I'm so disappointed that we just threw a $28.00 pizza in the trash because this pizza place doesn't know how to make pizza.",

    "text": "So me and my boyfriend thought of ordering some pizza for take out. We looked up their website on the phone and decided on two options - The Whole Engine and Roasted Chicken and Peppers. We called up to order, and the girl who was taking our order over the phone seemed completely befuddled at \"Roasted Chicken and Peppers.\" She asked the other staff about it and nobody seemed to know. Then she asked me \"so on the other half you only want chicken and peppers?\" After both me and my bf trying to tell them what we wanted (we even read out the exact name from their website) no one seemed to know what we were talking about, so we just decided to drive to Fuel Pizza and order there, thinking that maybe that particular one wasn't on the menu at this location. On getting there, we found the very pizza on their menu! So how am I supposed to trust a pizza shop to make my pizza right if they don't even know what's on their menu?  Also, while we waited for our pizzas, this place was so loud (I think it was the AC vent) that I got a headache from straining to hear my boyfriend over the sound. It was apparently so loud that the cashier did not hear us when we said this would be for take out, and our pizza was brought to our table.  Back to our food, the garlic knots had a good flavor, but they weren't as great as everyone else is saying they are. I mean sure, it's garlic and I've never had garlic knots that haven't been good but I don't think they were anything to write home about. The pizza was decent. The Whole Engine was delicious, the Roasted Chicken and Peppers, not so much.",

Next morning I woke up to several calls from my bank because they caught fraudulent charges on the card I gave fuel. Apparently someone there decided to buy a few pizzas for people on our card (or just ran a scam through the register, refunding in cash, who knows...but there were three more charges for different amounts after our initial order) and then try to do some online shopping. So this place is definitely not getting any business from us now. Require us to give our CC# over the phone and hire people who commit credit card fraud?

Decent, NY style pizza that is ok at best but nothing to write home about.  Sober me thinks they should change their name to Fuel Wings because those are the real shining star of the menu.  We got a pizza and 18 wings delivered last night (with a $2 delivery fee) and the total was $42 before tip, which I thought was a bit steep for what we received.  However, me after a few cocktails out in Plaza Midwood gives Fuel Pizza 5+++ stars.  Conveniently located in the middle of Central Ave and in walking distance to all the bars, this is a perfect way to end a fun night out.  The pizza is always hot and can be ordered by the slice.

The pizza isn't the best I've ever had, but the speed that it comes out and the friendliness of the service makes it my go to place for a quick bite in the plaza midwood area.  Lots of different slices to choose from in this converted old gas station.  Plenty of specials all at reasonable prices.  No place better to be for a quick bite late night on the weekends IMHO!",

When I ask the young man behind the counter who's in charge he pointed to a young lady who had a ponytail and was Caucasian standing off to the side talking on her cell phone and laughing and giggling and I do mean her personal cell phone all while I'm still on hold when I asked her was she the one that put me on hold she tried to convince me that they didn't had five calling orders which could not have been the case because she was not on the job phone if you ask me is unacceptable unprofessional and just a blatant disregard for customer service they won't have to worry about me coming back! *UPDATE* then to add insult to injury I just get back to work and this pizza is undone!!!!!!!!

I always though the renovated gas station was cute but sadly the care and attention to detail taken on the outside was not reflected on the inside. It was just a little grimy, and the drink selection was pretty low (maybe three types of alcohol and two types of soda left in the refrigerator). The person calling out the orders mumbled and was hard to hear even though there weren't many people there.   There were some good points though - fresh, hot pizza in a matter of minutes for a reasonable price. I can see the late night food appeal and while I am not rushing back I would certainly go again, especially at the end of the night.",

I always always always get my food as dine-in. The young lady brought my two pizza slices to me in a to-go box. It was no big deal initially, until she responded to my mentioning of it. I quite simply said \"I ordered my slices for here, you know me, I always eat here.\" She looked at me and said in a very sarcastic tone \"Well, your slices are in a box now, and I'm busy\" and turned around and walked away.

It sucks that they are closer but aren't following protocol...not cool...  We order the same pizza everytime we go, the Buffalo pizza. The flavor, the taste, everything is consistent.

Lets see how many people remember THAT place. We used to get a neighborhood discount and I used to get slices, wings, and calzones all the time from here and I REMEMBER thinking it was good. Either my tastebuds have changed over the last 10 years ( doubt it, I was BORN a foodie), I wasn't being picky, or they have gone downhill since then.   Looking for some late night grub, me and some buds dropped in for a late slice. As expected the options were quite limited. I got a slice of what appeared to be white pizza with spinach. The size is kinda that in between size, where one is not enough, and 2 is a bit too much.   I took the thing home heated it up in the oven and even added some feta and fresh cherry tomatoes to it. Even still it was flavorless.  Flavorless sauce, flavorless toppings, flavorless crust. The only thing I could actually taste were the things I added to it. But seeing as though I refuse to salt pizza, that was how it was to remain. I did all I could with the feta and tomatoes, and just went to sleep thinking I had wasted money and stomach real estate. I mean if it can't taste good drunk, its definitely not gonna cut it sober. Want late night pizza? Pester a friend into taking you to Benny's instead.",

At this point, I contacted Slice and asked what happened and went to bed.   This morning, I promptly received a refund from Slice and an apology - they contacted Fuel Pizza who responded by saying \"They got busy and never made my order\". Seriously? I can understand being busy because it was late night on a Saturday, but to not even make the order at all or have the courtesy to call and let me know they couldn't fulfill the order is absolutely ridiculous.

Literally every single time except for once when someone I knew took my order. I decided to give you guys a second chance this week, and the only reason I'm giving you 2 stars is because your staff is always extremely friendly. However, I ordered a calzone with pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and banana peppers in it this week. I only mention the ingredients because with 4 it should have been a fairly decent sized calzone. I ordered for carry-out, so I didn't look inside the box until I got to my destination. I wish I had looked at it before I left, but I asked the guy who was working if my garlic knots were included in the box and he said that he had checked to make sure everything was right.   When I opened the box I seriously could not believe what I had been given. This was the saddest calzone I have ever seen in my life. In no restaurant that I have ever worked in would this have been allowed to leave the kitchen. As thin as a slice of pizza (which I probably should have ordered instead), I'm not even sure how to describe the way it was overcooked while still undercooked. And I paid $13 for this thing.  I really love supporting local businesses but you guys have got to fix this sort of stuff. I'm not the type of person to call in demanding a refund or wanting something for free, I understand food costs and loss and would never want to get someone fired because I understand everybody has a bad day here and there, but please, get it together. Don't send people off with less than par food. In fact send them off with amazing product so you don't lose business to the other pizza joints popping up in the neighborhood.",

Great decor. However, the pizza choices were in glass containers, clearly made hours before- you know- when the cheese has gotten cold and is that gray color. The servers were just fine. After ordering- they put the pizza on a tray and warm it up. In the days of wood- fired and \"make on the spot,\" pizza- I'm not sure how Fuel will survive. Sorry- not fresh- no thank you.",

I was looking for the \"extreme meat\" but couldn't find any. We were given plates. No peppers. No napkins. No Utensil for the salad. The side salad was a joke. I asked that the tomatoes and onions be omitted from my order. Lettuce and carrots was all that the salad included. Fine. The lettuce was old. There were brown spots on some of the leaves. The pizza wasn't GREAT but it wasn't too terrible. It was that \"I'm eating this because I don't want to waste my money\" good. Won't be ordering from them again.",

I'd take frozen pizza over it (Yupp I'm that girl). However, their grandma's pizza. Now that pizza is bomb. The crust is thicker and almost has a  smooth buttery perfection to it. I honestly don't care for meat on my pizza but the pepperoni isn't too shabby on this one. I don't know why they call it grandma's pizza but they do.  Parking is kinda meh. My friend and I parked right across the street at the Walgreens. No issues with that at all. There is a parking lot right behind the building but it's kinda tight. Just a heads up :).",

They didn't like that and the blonde who saw nothing  chimes in after saying the girl was right when she was ringing up customers but apparently had a full view.   Gone here more times than I can account literally including the previous night, but per the attendant I've officially been a problem.

I hate to say it but you've really let yourself go and I'm just not that into you anymore. It's not me, it's you.   I asked you to come over tonight and you said you'd be here in 45-60 mins. My first thought was \"damn, it takes Fuel an hour to get ready for just a casual night in?\" But I figured you must've been having a busy night and I let it go. I waited and waited for you to show up.  2 HOURS LATER you finally did.  When you arrived I could tell you'd already been out for awhile. You were a mess- really cold, soggy and gross. And you forgot the extra ranch and veggies I asked you to bring with you. So basically I paid an extra $2 for absolutely no reason at all.  You can't say I didn't try, Fuel. Once I saw how bad things were going with us tonight, I tried to warm you up. But it was quickly obvious that I couldn't salvage things with us. You were downright nasty.  Things have gotten really one-sided between us and tonight was the last straw. You obviously don't care about me and I feel like you're just using me for my money. When I tried to call you to talk about it, you were SO RUDE. You made it very clear that you don't give two f$#s anymore.   So, at this point, I think it's best if we go our separate ways. Good riddance. Good luck.  You're gonna need it. Bye.",

This was my first time being back in probably 5 years and it has definitely gone downhill.

By the time I got to order, I asked for a slice of cheese pizza and garlic knots. The guy working the register told me they did not have garlic knots and I said, okay the girl just said you had \"everything\" coming up soon but that's fine. (???) As I was standing to the side waiting for my food to be ready, the register guy looked over at me and said, \"Can I help you with something?\" And I said, excuse me? And he goes, \"you're standing there staring at me like it's kinda weird\" ... Okay. Let me not go off on this dude right now.  ANYWAYS, very rude and unprofessional. I would have given one star BUT the guy who handed me my pizza box was polite and friendly, so he earned another star.

They have a pretty cool combo where you get a slice of pizza and 5 wings for about $8 (no drink included but if you want the drink it comes to around $10) I opted for a pepperoni slice an hot wings. The wait for the wings is about 6 mins which isn't bad. I can't resist pepperoni pizza it's actually pretty sick how I will just overlook any other slice lol. The slice came out good. Just the right about of Crispiness. I'm from New York we know pizza! The wings I was also pleased with. I couldn't decide on a sauce at first but hot seemed pretty standard. Both locations that I went to are in heavily popular places but I managed to get parking in both fairly quickly. Neither restaurant was really crowded either so no wait in line which is always a plus. Overall a great place when you are in the mood for pizza and wings which if you're me is all the time.

Delivery guy was super cool, very friendly, asked me about my hockey front license plate, which is a rarity for anyone to even notice here in the south. Sorry its not a Nascar plate.    This is where the great starts, we ordered a 19\" Super, with just cheese. Let me preface this by saying I am from the New Haven, CT area, which claims to be the first and best pizza in the nation.  Having been here in Charlotte for 5+ years now, I have given up hope of a \"hometown Pie\"  This was by far the closest thing to being home. I have had Fuel pizza by the slice before, but this was my first whole pie. Wow is there a difference. By the slice who knows long its been sitting, or under heat lamps.  It had fresh herbs in the sauce, perfect sauce amount, great cheese, and perfect chewy yet crisp crust.  Can't wait to order again!",

I don't like Fuel in general, because I never seem to have a good dining experience. I have been to the one uptown on College, the South Blvd. location and Central. My last visit in Plaza Midwood was on New Year's Day and it was my final straw. Maybe the employees were just as hung over as we were, but they acted like we were bothering them when we came in. Like I said before, maybe it was the day itself, but it was the nail in the coffin for me.",

    "text": "OMG this place has turned into a dump!  I have been eating at Fuel ever since they opened and they have gone way down hill.  They have no idea what customer service is and they mess our order up more often than they get it right.  The food isn't actually bad, but it isn't worth the experience of the hapless staff or the consistent errors with orders.  They really don't care and it shows.  If there is a manager in the place, you certainly couldn't tell.  You would think with all the new pizza places opening up near-by they would step up their game, but they only seem to get worse.  They had to call the police last time I was in a man was so mad about the staff.  I had to actually wake the person up at the register today because he forgot to even place my daughter's order for a slice of peperoni.  No apology or anything.  Just rude.  We usually eat at Fuel on average twice a week, but that is coming to an abrupt end today.",

    "text": "I've been to this Fuel Pizza before and would have given it an extra star, but this time around, have to give it a 2.  Reason being, my slice of pepporoni was floating in grease.  Now on the other hand my slice of just cheese was fine, so I guess if you don't add any kind of meat on the pizza, you'll probably be alright.  But, you can't judge a pizza parlor by just it's pizza, can you? The garlic knots were warm and fresh, with just enough garlic, served with a wonderful, tomatoey, garlic, oregano and basil laced dipping sauce.  It was so good, I dipped my puffy pizza crust end in it just to have something to sop it up with. My friend ordered a side salad with her slice and the caesar dressing.  I took a swipe off of her dressing lid, and mmmmm, it was very good...didn't know if it was homemade, or a really great bottled dressing you pay an arm and a leg for at Harris Teeter. Since this particular Fuel is housed in was once a filling station, there's lots of old auto memorabilia as well as .....well...memorabilia of all sorts.  There's also lots of customer decorated paper plates on the wall and some of them are really creative and artistic.....must be lots of NODA customers going there! And, the prices are good and the staff were very nice and quick!  It may have been an off day for them, and I expected better, but if I were that way again, I would probably order a pie to go, sans the pepperoni.  Anyone know how much grease a green pepper would put out?",

    "text": "The original Fuel Pizza in Plaza-Midwood is everything a local pizza point with big slices and generous toppings in a converted service station.  I can't say I'm a huge fan of Fuel @ Plaza Midwood, but I can't find much wrong with it either.  Fuel is a good bet for pizza wherever you can find one.  I highly recommend the strombolis here-they warm them up in the oven when you order them and serve them with marinara sauce.  The pizza slices are good as well.  The crust tastes like brick oven pizzeria crust and they always put generous slabs of fresh mozzarella cheese on whatever they make. Yum!  If you are jonesing for slices of pizza though, be sure to do so during the lunch hour peak.  Otherwise, you might find the pizza slices dried out.    The Plaza Midwood location is smaller than other Fuels, though the outdoor patio is ideal for people watching in Plaza Midwood.  The staff are pretty friendly as well, so I regularly stop in for a quick bite for lunch or cheap meal before a night in Plaza Midwood.",

While waiting for our order I noticed he over charged me. I informed him and he proceeded to argue and tell me I gave you what you ordered. I told him no I know what I told you. This went on for a minute. There were people sitting and eating they get up and leave.  this little man of manager is arguing.  Finally one of e employees returns my money and the manager throws some free slice pizza cards at us. I throw them back I won't be coming back here again. I called the next day to another store to explain what happened I get the spiel about someone will call you back. Well no one has to this day. Needless to say I will never visit any of these stores again. I've had better frozen pizza.",

You could tell that the slice had been sitting in the case for awhile and was just not hot enough, even after they warmed it up. Notsogood. This second time at Fuel, I learned from my earlier mistake and had them make an entire pie for my friend and me.  Bingo!  A much better experience.  The sauce was quite good as were the toppings.  I really like the novel concept of the place (a old timey gas station turned pizza place), and it has a cheery interior as well as free refills on fountain drinks.  I don't think it will be a destination place for me, but now that I know how to order, I could see myself returning.  Again, as a word of advice:  avoid the slices.",

I haven't been to the Park Rd. location but just by the reviews on this webpage alone, I think that the Central Ave. location has it beat by a long shot.  The employees are all pretty cool; one even commented on my MSTRKRFT flyer and said that he was attending the show as well.  I love places that don't require their staff to shave and allow tattoos, it helps keep them fresh and independent.  I thought that the establishment could have been a little cleaner, but it seems like grunge is the theme for a lot of the businesses on this block.",
