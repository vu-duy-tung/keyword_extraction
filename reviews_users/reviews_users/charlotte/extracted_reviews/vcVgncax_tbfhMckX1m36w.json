The King Fish classic, Yuzu wasabi, and shrimp sauce are all great recommendations that I would try based on your preference. You can also mix and match if you'd like free.

Everything here is very bright and fresh. The restaurant itself is nice and bright and the staff is so incredibly friendly it just gives you good confidence before you even order.  I'm familiar with the concept of poke, but from what I've seen with other customers coming in, the staff is more than open to helping a first timer through. They're all always cheery and smiling.  Happy to say the ambiance isn't a cover up for anything, just a nice touch! The food is great, everything is so fresh. All of the proteins I've tried here (Shrimp, Ahi tuna, and spicy tuna and salmon) are great, and the vegetables are nice and crisp.  I've been here a few times and have used the classic sauce each time. It's not that I am not adventurous, but it's so good, I've been experimenting with other protein combos first. Maybe I'll try other sauces some time, but I'd suggest going with Classic your first time.",

This one is about a 4 block walk from the McCullough light rail stop, which is convenient if you're coming from the Tryon side of UNCC for lunch, say. I tried salmon and tuna poke with gochujang sauce (which was not really two flames spicy, but still good). Added in a bunch of veggies, some crab salad and avocado, and crunchy bits on top. Verdict: for the price of a pack of grocery store sushi, you get a big fresh bowl of goodness made to order. It's not fancy, the quality of fish is about what you'd expect in the $10-12 fast food sushi price range. But everything tastes fresh and good. Will definitely go back!",

I'm sold! I had a signature Poke Bowl (The Braveheart) and modified it slightly to add in King Fish Classic sauce to cut down the spice of the Sriracha Aioli. Both sauces were amazing on their own. You can tell a lot of time has been put into making and crafting them. One of the owners served me and spent time talking with me. Genuine people with heart and passion for what they are doing. Love it, will be back!",

The difference between the two is the amount of protein. For the regular you have a choice of two and for the large you have three. The portion size is definitely worth the price. The regular standing at 8.95 and the large being 10.95. All their fishes were super fresh and the variety of toppings and sauces is definitely what makes this place special. Their yuzu wasabi sauce is so refreshing & tasty. If you're looking for something fast, but a more healthy alternative.. definitely check this place out. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "By now, I've frequented a number of poke restaurants, so I'd like to think I have a baseline for what distinguishes the superior from the mediocre. Unfortunately, I believe King Fish falls into the latter category. Here's why:  1. The rice to toppings ratio is way way off. They use the plastic bowls here that are very deep so the servers end up filling a lot of the large bowl with rice, since you can't fill the obvious extra space with expensive toppings. So more rice is just jam packed in the bottom until the bowl doesn't look so empty. This makes for a very lopsided meal--totally not balanced. Even if you tried your best to portion out your fish and toppings so that you don't eat it all at the beginning, you will undoubtedly be left with a lot of extra rice that you can a) eat by itself... or b) throw away, which is just wasteful. I suggest King Fish get shallower bowls or something to combat this issue.  2. Although the base prices for King Fish are quite competitive and cheaper than I've seen at other places, I was less impressed after I found out they charge for staples that are usually free--including Kani Salad and seaweed salad! Upcharging for little things like that which are usually free add-ins left a bad taste in my mouth.  3. Finally, my husband got the Niner signature bowl and they told us they had no more mango..so the employee suggested mandarin oranges..which he later found out they also didn't have! This was on a Saturday afternoon for lunch..I could understand if it was late night weekday..but you don't have these key ingredients (mango..since it was listed in the signature niner) during your prime business hours? Hmm..  Anyways, I know they're new so hopefully these kinks will be addressed.",

The tuna and salmon were super fresh and the fish sauce(?) that was suggested was really, really good!  If you like poke bowls, go give this place a try!",

    "text": "This is gonna be our new spot when we are craving poke fish! Best one so far hands down compared to the other 3 we went to in Charlotte.  This is why: 1) For a poke bowl at $8.95 (Regular-2 proteins) and $10.95 (Large-3 proteins) with the amount of protein you get, prices are very reasonable!! Heck my girlfriend couldn't even finish hers and she got a regular 2 protein size. Not to mention they're very delicious and I finished every bite!  2) You get option of creating your own bowl, sushi burrito or salad having them create a signature bowl.   3) The restaurant is clean, aesthetic, and has a minimalistic feel with a welcoming feel.  Nonetheless, try this place out when you're hungry for poke! You won't regret it! You'll come in hungry, and leaving fully satisfied!",

I started with brown rice (I'd read on another review that they give too much rice so I asked for less than normal - which was still a lot of rice!) and chose tuna and salmon as my protein. I then added carrots, cabbage, edamame, jalapenos, cucumbers, seaweed salad, cilantro, green onions, tempura flakes, and spicy mayo.   All in all - I thought it was tasty and fresh. My only complaint would be the lack of protein. Compared to the ratio of rice and toppings, it just wasn't enough fish. With that being said, the flavors were great, as was the price. I still want to try some other poke spots in CLT but will definitely come back here (and ask for a bigger serving of fish) in the future.",

I contacted DoorDash and they were able to give me a full refund and said they will be contacting the store to inform them of the issue.",

The funny thing is, my friends got a large bowl (for $10.95, which is still a great deal - 3 proteins), and our bowls were the same size.  They even looked pretty much the same, with all the content inside.  I understand the protein is the costliest item on the menu, and looks are deceiving, because it's just a few more scoops of fish, but I'm just saying you can be satisfyingly full with a regular bowl if you choose your toppings well!  I got a regular bowl with salmon and tuna, and the fish tasted pretty good, considering the price point.  The toppings all seemed fresh, and I thoroughly enjoyed my bowl.  The space is clean and well-kept, and the service was friendly and prompt.  Overall, King Fish is a great bang-for-your-buck option when it comes to poke / sushi, in my opinion.",

It's got a very sleek, modern feel with not too many tables crammed in there. The menu is displayed on large screens right above the prep station.   This is another Chipotle-style, choose your own ingredients. You can start off with either a salad, bowl (with either brown or white sushi-style rice), or burrito. For my first visit, I chose a regular-size poke bowl with sushi rice. You are then given a choice of two scoops of protein: shrimp, salmon, tuna, or chicken, tofu.  I went with two scoops of tuna and then proceeded to have my bowl topped with cucumber slices, matchstick carrots, diced green onion, edamame, red cabbage, jalapeno. You are then able to pick which sauce you would like added, I went with gochujang because I love heat. I asked for it on the side but, normally, they would throw into the bowl to make sure all ingredients are coated. Their gochu is/was delicious. I will happily have them douse my poke bowl with that sauce on my next visit.  There are also extra additions you can have added to your bowl/burrito, etc such as avocado ($1.25 extra), ginger slices, wasabi, shredded nori, and so on.  If you're not in the mood to make that many decisions, you can choose one of their pre-made combinations that are listed on their menu. For as much as you get, the price is VERY reasonable. Total for my poke bowl came to $9.60.   I'm happy to have this place in the area and will be back!",

Still a good deal for that amount of fresh fish and other food.  That said, the fresh fish....  I'm not quite sure how fresh the \"spicy\" versions of each meat are, nor am I sure if the crab is actually crab, or is faux-crab which is normally spelled like krab.  Anyhow, I didn't order any of those things, just stuck with the tuna and salmon, which was great.  Another side note, the back door didn't work, not sure if that is legal or not, especially in a place with a kitchen.  I'll be back for sure.  I love this new trend in places like this popping up over the country and this is my favorite one for the north Charlotte area for sure.",

    "text": "This is the cheapest poke bowl place in town I've come across.  $8.95 for 2 proteins and unlimited toppings!  You cannot beat that!  The service was great, they offer samples if you're unsure about a topping or sauce.    Everything looked of great quality - the Tuna tasted like it had been out a bit, but not awful enough to deter me from a future visit.  I got a sushi burrito and a bowl. The burrito  turned out to be a bit smaller than I expected. I had so many toppings I'm not sure how - but I was still hungry after.  So I was glad I got a bowl too.    I like to get my poke bowls over greens (salad) - it's definitely a game changer if you're looking to refrain from rice.  Overall, I feel like the ingredient prep will get better as they settle in their routine. Glad the University area got a poke bowl spot!  UPDATE: I've been back twice in June/July 2018 and they've definitely got their routine packed, every protein/topping looks and tastes fresh - and the customer service has been nothing but amazing!",

The selection and quality of mix-ins,toppings and flavors makes this place apart from other poke places.(try their King Fish Classic, also I personally love Korean Gochujang-so good and if youre a spice lover be sure to check it)  Service is always good no matter they're super busy or not. Price also reasonable! Definitely worth stopping by and trying if you're in Charlotte. Highly recommended!",

It was so good with a great blend of flavors! Affordable price around $12 since seaweed salad was additional $2 but oh so worth it!   The salmon was just so-so in my opinion and don't taste the freshest but overall the bowl was rlly tasty! They workers were super nice too because I came close to closing time!

Last thing is the crunch my choice was: garlic crisps and to top it off tempura puffs. Overall place is clean, customer service is great and of course the food is great.

Short and to the point, I've always been impressed with the food even though I had a severe allergic reaction on my last visit here. This is the second or third time I've had a severe reaction to food and let me be clear, this is in NO WAY King Fish Poke's fault! It turns out that after scheduling an appointment with an allergy specialist and getting a full panel test done, I found out that my body reacts very poorly to sesame! King Fish is very good at labeling their bowls and one of the ingredients in the bowl I got here was black sesame. Upon doing some research, black sesame has a significantly higher concentration of oil and proteins that cause my reaction!  Again, I want to make sure everyone understands that if anything, King Fish helped me realize that I needed to get this food allergy figured out!  Aside from all that, my bowl was delicious (I don't react instantly to my food allergies apparently, it took an hour before any of the effects kicked in). Their fish is extremely fresh and toppings are top notch. I also noted that the restaurant, while very minimal, was spotless and squeaky clean.  I can't wait to return and try something else, probably without Black Sesame, haha! Oddly enough, I can have regular sesame and although I am still sensitive to it, I'd have to be having a really bad day (exposure and/or buildup to other things I'm allergic to) to have a full-on reaction.  Probably the oddest positive review I've ever written but still positive nonetheless. Thanks again King Fish for the awesome fresh food! I'm almost certain the next visit will be a five star experience.",

    "text": "I've been to a few poke spots on the East Coast but none in Hawaii so I can only tell you that this one is consistent with the themes I've seen and might not be close to traditional.  Poke is similar to the assembly line sort of thing that's been popularized and commoditized with Subway and Chipotle. You start at one end of the line, pick your base, and as you go down the rest of the line, add toppings or mix-ins until you're at the register. Easy and simple.  King Fish Poke offers salads and burritos and bowls with a handful of different proteins including fresh salmon and tuna, toppings including seaweed salad and cucumber and carrots and edamame, then add some sauce with a flavor. It's easy, it feels super healthy and it's delicious.  As I'm working my way through a keto-friendly diet, I stuck to the salad base adding salmon and tuna with cucumber and cilantro and red cabbage, topping it with the wasabi aioli that was rather spicy. A big bowl of food and very delicious.  The shop is super clean and the guys working the line are friendly and speedy.  [Review 10249 overall, 12 of 2019.]",

Nice.  I settled on a lettuce base, spicy tuna and shrimp as my proteins.  Everything was very fresh.  I think you'll like it, too.  All for under $10 including tax.  Cool.

    "text": "I arrived during lunch time on a weekday. King Fish Poke is located in a shopping center. Plenty of parking available shared by multiple businesses.   The space is big, clean, open, and bright. Lots of seating. The staff greeted me when I approached the counter. I was intrigued that they not only offer poke bowls, but also sushi burritos. I let the staff know that I couldn't decide between the two. She asked how hungry I was and I replied, \"very\" so she suggested a bowl. You have the option of creating your own bowl/burrito or choosing from one of their King Fish Signatures. I went with her suggestion and ordered a bowl.  Step 1: Choose your size (Regular: 2 proteins $8.95 or Large: 3 proteins $10.95) and base (choice of white rice, brown rice, and lettuce/spring mix. You can choose half and half). Step 2: Choose your protein (salmon, ahi tuna, spicy tuna, tofu, shrimp, chicken, and char siu pork). Step 3: Choose your mix (unlimited - sweet onion, cucumber, edamame, seaweed, red cabbage, jalapeno, cilantro, mango, mandarin orange, and carrots). Step 4: Choose your flavor (shrimp sauce, wasabi aioli, sriracha aioli, King Fish Classic, yuzu wasabi, and Korean gochujang). Step 5: Choose your toppings (sesame seeds, green onion, wasabi, ginger, masago, seaweed salad, crab salad, and avocado - some for upcharge). Step 6: Choose your crunch (onion crisps, garlic crisps, shredded nori, and toasted rice puffs).  I ordered a regular bowl $8.95 + crab salad ($1.25), seaweed salad ($.49), and lots of mixes and toppings. The regular was more than enough for me. I took about half to go. It was fresh and flavorful! I will have to come back and try their sushi burrito next time.",

    "text": "Had the opportunity to try this place while I was in town for training. $10 for a large is a great price considering it's usually $14/$15 where I'm from. I built my own bowl with sushi rice and I absolutely loved the rice. My usual spot only offers plain white rice but their sushi rice totally kicked it up a notch! It was sweet and tangy and very flavorful and really enhanced all of the ingredients I added.   I got the salmon which was really fresh and flavorful. They had a wide variety of toppings and were certainly not skimping on their scoops! I got fresh veggies like edamame, onions, avocado and cilantro. I got a side of crab salad, seaweed salad and pineapple. My only thing was that their options included mango which is my favorite to add, but both times that I went they had none available and only had pineapple. All in all, it was a great experience. The portions were huge, definitely had enough left over for two lunches and the ingredients were fresh and tasty.",

The vibe of the place reminds me of being in a modern tropical costal town. Simple design and nice light neutral color. I ordered a salmon and shrimp sushi burrito with fillings like cilantro, onions, avocado, shredded crab, cucumber red cabbage carrots even garlic crunchy flakes and it was the best and freshest tasting! I was allowed to taste the sauce before ordering to be sure I knew what I liked which were all of them. I was so focused on eating I didn't even take photo guys seriously. I think im going back for dinner I was extremely satisfied and would recommend King Fish Poke to any fresh seafood lovers and don't worry if your bestie doesn't like seafood they can get veggie or even chicken ( I KNOW !!!!!!!!) My drink was a fountain ginger ale with strawberry syrup super refreshing! Thanks for the wonderful experience and even better food!",

We got the large three's scoop protein version with brown rice and we had enough food for lunch and dinner.",

We both chose salmon and ahi tuna as our proteins and the fish was very fresh, as was the avocado that I added to my bowl. The sauces are amazing, and their King Fish Classic sauce is a must try! Also, I love that they offer fruits as toppings! All in all, it's definitely a 5/5 experience!",

Drove two hours from Anderson, SC just to fulfill my poke craving yesterday. To anyone living in Charlotte, this place should definitely be on your restaurant rotation.",

    "text": "Wow, can I give a shoutout to the SERVICE here at King Fish Poke!!! We originally came to this shopping center for the middle eastern grill next door, but saw the poke shop and thought we'd just stick our head in and see what they had. One of the male workers saw us reading the menu and proceed to come over and talk us through the menu, his personal favorite, and recommend mix-ins and sauces and such -- after all that, how could we say no? The woman at counter (it's a chipotle-style assembly line) began to help my companion, and the man who was formerly talking to us put on a pair of gloves to serve me when he realized I wanted to order too, even though I didn't mind waiting for her to finish with my companion -- after all, we were the only two in line. Then, once we got our food, he came over about five minutes after we sat down to check on us and see how we liked it. Every conversation we had with him, he had a big smile on his face. If I lived in charlotte, I would come here for the service alone!  Now, as to what I actually paid for: the food. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our meal; they offer sushi burritos, bowls, and salads. My boyfriend said he wished they had a bit more variety in fish, but that didn't take away from his experience. And all mix-ins and sauces are unlimited!",

Delish, and my only regret is that this place isn't closer to my hometown so we could eat here more often.
