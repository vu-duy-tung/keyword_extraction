Rice and beans, fried pork, plantains, guacamole, yucca, soup, Cuban sandwiches, mango and other fresh fruit  milkshakes,  flan ... REAL FRESH CREAMY FLAN... , tres leches cake .... And to top it off Cuban cafe au lait.  As for the decor... It was like stepping into my Ecuadorian family's restaurant in Quito... dark wood, high back leather chairs, deep red curtains and wrought iron accents, tiled dance floor ... and the service was just like family ... welcoming and generous to a fault.  Yup ... It's ALL that ... And did I mention the food is to die for...   One of our new favorite places for sure... And one of these nights my Mamacita is going to light up the dance floor.",

We had a debit from the checking account for the $59 AND the $82. When we went back to speak to the manager. She said it was up to the debit company to correct. She refused to fix it even after we demanded cash back. She said it would be applied back to the account in a month. INSANE. We would not EVER eat here again. BEWARE.",

I remained about 10-15 minutes before the bartender finally asked me if I wanted a drink and I told him I was waiting for food, he gladly took care of me! Except for the bartender, the kind of service I received will not make me want to return any time soon. Hopefully they haven't lost too many potential customers due to this!  John B.",

The highlight was seeing Coach Riveria for the Carolina Panthers there with his family and friends while we waited. There was no one to greet us when we walked in. After having to ask for the host we were told there was no tables available. So we sat the bar. I had a pina colada without alcohol. It was too sweet. The pork bites were nicely seasoned and good.

I only mention it because there werent live musical instruments being played, but it was okay because whatever sound system they have makes the music sound like it is live in the building.  They were great singers and even stepped out and danced at times with the customers who gathered at the front to dance.      I ordered the stewed beef with rice. It was very good. I also tried the strawberry mojito.  Im not typically a drinker, but it was very strong (to me). I don't know if that's good or bad.

We went on a Saturday, and got there early enough that it wasn't yet crowded.   But the food is what really disappointed us. My churrasco (skirt steak), came out very overcooked (I had asked for it medium-rare).  Not even a hint of pink in it. It had also been pounded with a meat tenderizer until it looked like a cube steak. I sent the steak back, and the next one came out a bit less overcooked, but still no where near medium-rare.   My husband's picadillo was even more disgusting. The meat was ground so fine it was about the texture of canned cat food. It was covered in a gloppy tomato sauce. Normally a picadillo has things in it, like peppers and olives. None of that in this version, just meat ground to an unrecognizable pulp with tomato sauce.  Both entrees came with black beans and rice. The rice was mushy and completely unseasoned. The black beans were also woefully underseasoned. We had tostones with our meals instead of the standard maduros. The tostones were overly soft and very greasy.  I agree with previous reviewer would suggest Carlos Cafe in Rock Hill. The food is always well-seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the service is great as well.",

Waiting thru most of my meal for someone to come by to see if we need anything was a bummer. Any good waiter/tress will stop by a few minutes after food is served to check on the table.

We would get seated right away but then it would take awhile for our order to be taken.  Once we ordered the food came out pretty quickly but then it would take awhile to get drink refills.  By the time we got refills we were ready for our checks which also took awhile to get.  Aside from that the food was pretty good.  I had the ropa vieja the first time which was good but didn't come with enough rice (at least for me, I like to have some rice for each bite and I ran out half way into my meal!)  I had to ask for more, which they had no problem just giving me some more.  The second time I went I tried the lechon asado which was also good.  This time I ordered the rice which had the black beans mixed in and that was a better helping than when I ordered the rice with the beans on the side...I'll definitely be back for lunch to try some of their other dishes but hopefully they can get their service a little faster.  They are very nice and helpful but just a little on the slow side!",

He is Puerto Rican and we have yet to find anywhere to eat since we moved here in August, 2006. We found one place - I am naming no names - but it was not authentic and we were excited to go out to this place for his birthday dinner. We got there and were seated quickly. We loved the atmosphere and thought surely the service and the food would measure up...NOT - it took forever to get our drinks, we had a party of 5 - including 3 adults - and only got 5 rolls. They don't have Cuban bread! They even only brought 3 pats of butter. It took the waiter several times to understand our order so when it was my husband's turn to order - he ordered in Spanish which the waiter still didn't seem to understand. Our food came out with the white rice cold, the tostones cold, the plantains cold - my chicken soup never came - the waiter said he thought I said I didn't want it??? My Chicken Milanesa was not supposed to have onions but I bit right into one! The tostones were soft not firm - the yellow rice was weird - not authentic and I have had plenty of arroz amarillo in my day. We asked for more bread on several occasions and it never came, nor did our refills. When we asked the last time for more bread - we were told it would take 7 minutes!!! We told the waiter of our dissatisfaction and he didn't say too much. When the check finally came - the waiter said - the owner gave you a discount and some coupons...A 10% discount off of a $55- $60 bill! The coupons were what they would give anyone - buy 1 entree and 2 drinks and get one half off! I will never go back here again! What a waste!",

    "text": "As a native South Floridian partially raised by Cubans, I know my way around Cuban cuisine. Reading through some of the reviews, I was a bit hesitant to go to A Piece of Havana, knowing that my hopes and dreams of a walk down memory lane could easily be dashed. Suffice it to say, I'm glad my fear of disappointment didn't get in the way of my need to reminisce.  We went at kind of an off time: 3pm on Saturday and there were very few people there. We were greeted and seated right away, then the fun began. Our server was delightful, especially since she was helping me persuade my fellow dining compatriots to enjoy some adult libations with me.  Mojitos, Cuban bread, crispy shredded beef, Havana chicken, shrimp, black beans and rice, and Cuban coffee...?! You can't go wrong and I'm excited to go back.",

I personally hate loud music while I'm eating and they had a microphone on every instrument.  In a small space like their dining room you don't need to be that mic'd up.  I was deaf before we got our food and we couldn't carry a conversation with our friends.    A good band knows how to adjust their volume for the venue.  They played a weird mix of Latin and US pop songs, and Bob Marley.  I wouldn't go back just for their band unless they lowered the volume and stuck to a theme in their music.  It's not a drunk wedding crowd they're playing for...  I got the Cuban sandwich (no cheese) with fries.  It was pretty tasty but I was burping pork the following 24 hours.  We went out afterwards and I definitely did not feel like dancing!  I would go back to try another dish but only if that's the only thing we're doing all night...",

    "text": "This hurts to write...my hope is that the owners read this and course correct the issues. I have been coming here since 2015. I have hosted corporate team dinners, family reunions, dinner parties - probably have dined here 25-30 times. The service was always hit or miss...but being Cuban I didn't mind...and  because food was always incredible. Not tonight. It was average at best. Our entire table commented that the food had no taste. The ropa vieja was fatty and bland. The yuca was dry and the mojo was all lime [barely any garlic]. Overall - disappointing...and we want to come back so please re-train the cooks. I asked my waiter if they had hired new cooks and he responded that they are always training new cooks so my suggestion is put some quality controls in place. We ordered a flan and when the server brought it to us the caramel/sugar around the flan was all black - clearly it was burnt and as such tasted bitter. I would have hoped that the waiter would have not served that and then took that opportunity to give the cook some feedback. I regret that I didn't provide this feedback while there - but again, my hope is the owners see this and take action. The meals I have had there in the past were some of the best Cuban food experiences I have had...and this from a Cuban who moved here from Miami. Please, please please take action!!!",

    "text": "It's really unfortunate that I'm giving this restaurant a bad review. We've been here a couple of times and our first visit was okay. Our second visit however, was absolutely terrible. We came with a group of friends before a church event. There were eight of us in when one of our group members went in to get a seat, the restaurant told us that they did not have space for us. At the time, the restaurant was completely empty and they continued to turn us away. Eventually, my friend had to beg to be able to eat there, and they allowed it as long as we promised to leave by 8 PM.   The staff must have felt frustrated about having to serve us after claiming that they did not have space. The server was extremely rude and inattentive. She rolled her eyes several times and was extremely impatient.   Several people in the group had made an order for chicken. While our food was being made, one of the servers came out to tell us that there was no chicken of that type yet and suggested that they replace it with a different kind of chicken. We agreed and that's what they served. However once we got our check, The three of us that had ordered the chicken found that we had been upcharged for the chicken breast. This was completely unacceptable, considering that the change made in the menu was made by the restaurant. And needless to say, the meal was sub-par as it could not be prepared in its original, authentic way.   It took more than 30 minutes for us to get our meals. Overall it was such a disheartening and disappointing experience. We were there for the joy of authentic Cuban food and hospitable service, and we did not get either. To be completely honest this experience was enough to deter me from going back. I hope that The staff could be more mindful about the customers' needs.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to southwest Charlotte and to A Piece of Havana. Growing up in Tampa, I have had the opportunity to eat at some authentic Cuban restaurants, but since moving to North Carolina, it has been difficult finding  Cuban food. For the most part, they fall short of my expectations.  Dora here. With so few Spanish restaurants in the Charlotte area, we were surprised to find the place empty. This is what it looked like on a Sunday around 11:30, but during our meal, people started rolling in. We just tend to be earlybirds.  For an appetizer, we chose the Caribbean Calamari, breaded, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce. The calamari was plentiful, good, fried crispy, (maybe too crispy) and worked well with the dipping sauce. Dora here. Dry and brittle for me, but hubby cleaned the plate, so...  For my meal, I chose one of my favorite Cuban specialties, Fried Pork chunks slow cooked in Mojo sauce then deep fried and topped with sauteed onions. The pork chunks were great, fried perfectly and mixed well with the Mojo sauce and sauteed onions although more mojo sauce would have been great. The plantains (banana family) were firm, just as I remembered them, and the fried yuca was cut into larger pieces than I prefer.  Dora here. After living in Tampa for so long and loving Spanish food, I admit being a little disappointed upon first glimpse of the Palomilla Steak (Bistec de Palomilla). Pounded super thin and unbreaded, I could've done without the chimichurri sauce. I don't believe it added anything and actually detracted from the presentation. What do you think?   Still Dora. Service was quick and the place was spotless. If we make it back (it's a long drive), I will order something different to avoid comparing A Piece of Havana with all our favorite haunts in Florida. The meal ended on a high note.  We rate this restaurant 3.5 forks out of 5 for a family restaurant serving very good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

The white rice was hard, so also undercooked. The green beans and rolls were nice. The atmosphere is dark, very nightclub feel but you are surounded by families, feels disjointed which is interesting because they have a lounge on the other side of the wall, what?  Personally I think the venue is too small for live music, but doesn't stop them grom putting her in the center.",

I am guessing she is the owner's daughter bc there is no other way you would have someone with such poor people skills in the front. It is so bad that when you go during their peak hours and are waiting for a table, random people bond over her horrible service. She is so rude to customers and the rest of the staff, it seriously puts a huge dent in your dining experience.  I do want to note that everyone else in the staff is great!

    "text": "When I was feeding my car down by Carowinds Blvd, I used my new(er) BFF aka my droid phone Yelp app to locate a new place for lunch.  The truth is I've been condemned to un-cultured, un-worldly food for way too long.  I was determined to get some real taste back in my mouth before it goes on strike.  Who knows there's a cuban restaurant in the suburbs!  The location is obscure... a little strip mall off Tryon (right at Moss).  Something about Cuban/Latino music, it just brightens the day (and the place).  Ok, so the service was slow (no one sat me, but to their defense I was standing by the hostess stand looking at the menu, I think they thought I was a to-go customer).  Lunch menu (smaller portion) is only available during the week.  So I went after the sandwich (didn't feel like breaking my bank for a quick solo lunch).  Instead of the old standby Cuban sandwich, I tried the Miami Sandwich.  It's like a Cuban with with lettuce, tomato and mayo and ham croquettes.  I love croquettes.  I also orderd the soup of the day, Ajiaco Cubano.    The soup was tasty.  Though it's very brothy (not as much as stew-y as it's described during my quick research online).  It definitely wasn't creamy like the waitress said.  But nonetheless it was good.  My cup ($2.95) had a piece of fatty pork and a little yuca in it.    The sandwich ($8.95) itself was ok.  The pork was a little tough.  That's the disappointing part. (side note: best freaking Cuban sandwich EVER was the one I got in DC in the market... see my old review).  The bread was good, and the mayo/mustard added to the taste.  I definitely enjoyed the croquettes, which were being deliciously smushed by every bite I took.  The sandwich was big enough for me to save half for later.  I substituted fries with plantains maduros.  I'm a sucker for sweet plantains.  And they were good.  But is it possible to mess up sweet plantain?!  Overall it was an ok experience.  The waitress was nice, but I can see if it's busier (the place had 3 other tables at the most, virtually empty) the service would be slow.  The pork was the least impressive.  But I was happy, I was very very happy that I haven't lost my appreciation for REAL food :)",

We've made reservations several times: sometimes they'll seat us right away, sometimes they'll try to put us at a two-seat table right in the middle of the dancefloor and the greeter will argue with us when we tell her we reserved a booth.

We were totally impressed with the food. The service was excellent and the waiter patiently explained what we didn't know about the food we were ordering. I finished with Cuban coffee.

However, once we were finally seated and our order was taken, the food was ultra fast. Our server asked if we were familiar with Cuban food, and well, I've never been there, so no. We ordered the roasted pork and grilled fish (mahi mahi). The roasted pork was good, the fish was OK but I'd order something different next time.  The plantains were (of course) delicioso, and I wished we had tried some of their really yummy looking mojitos (like 18 flavors) or sangria.    But the whole point of this review is that FINALLY after waiting my whole life (OK so the 14 years I've been in the QC), I found worthy empanadas!! The server said the ham & cheese was his favorite but I went for the beef.  The pastry covering was nice and crispy, but not greasy at all and the beef was seasoned perfectly and also was not greasy at all!  Hallelujah!! Hail to the empanada maker!  Even though I live nowhere near Steele Creek/Ayrsley I would make an excuse to come back and have a meal of mojitos, empanadas, perhaps some of their avocado dip special and tres leches. Bueno!  Tip: coupon in Citipass made it even more reasonably priced.",

The server was nice but it seemed like it was a Cuban restaurant trying to give the appearance of a Mexican one to gain money from \"anglo locals\" that assume anything \"Latin\" = Mexican.

My waiter was nice and attentive once he came over. Two of the eight tables were speaking Spanish, which could be a good sign that ethnic locals frequent this place.  I had the Original Mojito, Cuban Salad, Pork Chunks with Congri and Plantains. The mojitos here are all made from scratch. My mojito was made right away and was very good. The Cuban Salad came out in about five minutes, and the meal came out a few minutes later. The salad was just as it appears in pictures posted to Yelp. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. The pork chunks were properly marinated and cooked, and were really good. The congri and the plantains were as I expected, which is to say good and authentic.  I ordered the Tres Leches for dessert. While it was ok, it certainly was not authentic. Instead of the real thing, this was a slice of pound cake soaked in condensed/evaporated milk with whipped cream topping covered with a squirt of dulce de leche.  Overall, the food and drinks were great, dessert was ok, and service was ok.",

But A Piece of Havana is the sort of place where I'd really have to be stretching to find any reasonable criticism.  In the 10-15 times I've been here I've tried several different appetizers, entrees, desserts and cocktails and not once has anything failed to impress. As far as I'm concerned, there are really only a few things a Cuban place has to get right: Cuban sandwich, mojito, ropa vieja, flan and cortadito. And finally, some effort has to be made with the decor and music to make the diner forget for a moment that he/she is actually still in Charlotte, NC.   In every one of these and many more, A Piece of Havana surpasses expectation. Something as simple as their black beans are the best black beans I've ever had. The flan is also the best I've had, at least outside of the Spanish speaking world.   Perhaps most impressive, the Cuban sandwich is as good as you're going to get outside of south Florida. I grew up taking family vacations to the Tampa Bay area to visit family. And until I found this place I'd given up on finding a proper Cuban sandwich in Charlotte. I don't know where they get their bread or if they bake it themselves, but it makes the sandwich. Everywhere else, to their eternal shame, seems to substitute French bread.",

Both were pretty good along with some tostones and plantains.   Crispy beef was a bit oily but I ate every bite of it.  This time I had the garlic shrimp and tostones and boiled yucca and the gal had some skirt steak with rice and beans and a couple plantains again.  Skirt steak was ordered well done and was a little chewy which is expected cooked well but did taste good.  The garlic shrimp was decent some where cooked better than others, I like my shrimp cooked longer, more well done, a couple were that way and a few were softer, not as good.  Yucca was perfectly cooked and tostones,  well, it's hard to mess up a tostones,  so it was good as well.  Service was good, waiter was very attentive,  didn't have to look for him for anything.

Most restaurants give bread that you can munch on while your food is being prepped but not this one. You have to order it like an appetizer to get any. The food is standard but not exceptional. Our reason for going to a restaurant is to eat and not to socialize. For others gathering here as a group function with no rush to get done with their meals, this place would probably be fine. Couldn't help but wonder how the lunch crowd get serviced during the week when their lunch time is limited... Not sure if we'll be back. There are other restaurants that consider the needs of their customers that we'll revisit before Havana.",

This is the first place (Out of Puerto Rico or Miami) that serves authentic Cuban food.    Want to know if you're in a real Cuban Restaurant?  Ask for a Materva.  If they don't have any, calmly proceed to the door.  Guess what, A  Piece of Havana keeps them ice cold.  Friday night is great here.  The Jazz band plays great Latin music, and creates a great ambiance.  The food:  My favorites are the Ropa Vieja, and the Parrillada Cubana will give you a a huge selection of food (steak, pork, and chicken), plus rice beans and sweet plantains.    Next time I go there, I plan to order the Sea Food Paella.  It looked insane.    I would eat here every week if it was closer to my house.  Have I said enough?  Go get your Cuban on!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stopped in one day since I've always wanted to try the place and pass it all the time on the way to Club Fitness. We ordered some sangria and Havana Sampler to start. The sangria, turnover and plantains were delicious. The fried pork chunks, meat balls, and fried yuca were very bland and overcooked/dry. We also got the roasted chicken which is supposedly a house specialty. The portion was huge but the sides and chicken itself were again bland and overcooked.   OVerall, this would have gotten the place at least a \"meh\" and two stars. However, the service was absolutely terrible. I never like it when servers interrupt you during a meal and ask how it's going while you're still chewing on a large forkfull but at Piece of Havana I had to get up and ask for an extra silverware despite trying to flag down a waiter making his rounds. I then had to wait abnormal lengths of time to get a water refill. At that time I also requested a sangria refill but by the time it came out we were already done with our meal! I then had to get up again and go to the hostess station to ask for my check! Very inattentive service led us to not even order the tres leches dessert which I've heard is fantastic. This is too bad since I won't be back.",

Service was quick and steaming hot.  However, we stop in today (Sunday evening) for dinner and service was not so good...  First, for a Sunday evening (6:30p) customers were few at hand. (maybe 8)..so we had hoped service would be quick and attentive...NOT!!  On the contrary, service was very slow... Secondly..We waited at least 30 minutes to be served. (remember almost empty restaurant) Thirdly, and most disappointing, was the food...Unlike the lunch service, the food was luke warm....Important ingredient (Mojo sauce) left out of recipe....Rice, cold...Plantains, burned.  Smh!!  Not acceptable.... If you plan on visiting this restaurant....Make sure it's LUNCH TIME!!  Because the food is really good...",

The to stones were great. I had the masitas de puerco and they were great too. I asked for lime just because that was how we ate them growing up, with lots of lime. The boiled yuca was good, could have used a bit more mojo. My kids had a pan con bistec. It was the thin steak cooked just as it should, i am just not sure it was on real cuban bread. It comes with mayo and mustard so we opted to have it without. They ate it all though and really liked it. The Cuban coffee (espresso) was very authentic, the way they make it on calle ocho. We look forward to returning. So glad to find this place!",

    "text": "I have frequented this dining establishment several times and have experienced the same service, rude and unprofessional. My first encounter was when we got to the restaurant approximately 1-hour before they were closing to be turned away because the \"kitchen was closed\". Good luck talking to the hostess, she is extremely rude and unprofessional. The second experience was just last night where my friend and I went there to listen to music and eat dinner to only be confronted by the same rude hostess stating that they only take reservations and there are no tables. It makes absolutely zero sense to me why a restaurant would only accept 100% reservations and turn away every walk-in customer.  Anyways, we got a table after speaking to the Manager. The food was good, the experience not so much. Do not go here if you want to dine comfortably and then dance. They have rules which are pretty standard for actual 'clubs'. I was asked to leave because I was wearing shorts. If management is going to be strict about their \"Friday Night\" dress code, then they should have the same rule for dining or state the time the 'rule' goes into effect. From what I gather, most people who dine late tend to stay and listen to the DJ and dance, so again, if they want to be strict about their \"Friday Night\" dress code they should impose the same rule for dining AT ALL TIMES or state the actual time their 'rule' goes into effect (you're welcome).  I find their attempt to be a 'club' ambitious but their attempt is lackluster due to the poor management, including the rude and unprofessional hostess and waitstaff.",

During my time waiting I noticed how other guess were engaged and remembered the lack of attention I received. I felt if I spoke Spanish then my experience would have been different. I was not offered a refill of my wine glass or just coming over to Check and see how I was doing. It took some time to get my order but I just left the payment and left.

We were a party of approximately 20 people so our service was a little slower than it would for a smaller party. Going to dinner with a large party, a longer wait is to be expected so it wasn't a big deal. I ordered the mango mimosa and it was quite tasty!! For dinner, I had the shrimp with garlic sauce and chose yellow rice with veggies and Cuban toast as my sides. The shrimp was DELISH!! The yellow rice with veggies was a little on the salty side but I ate it all so I suppose it wasn't entirely TOO salty, lol! My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich and it tasted excellent! It was my first Cuban sandwich and I'm not a huge pork eater but ended up eating the second half of his sandwich for lunch today! The prices are reasonable but my cousin ordered a strawberry/mango margarita and it tasted too sweet and syrupy. I would recommend you try the mimosas!! Everyone was pleased with theirs! The restaurant itself is clean and the bathroom was nice!   It was also a plus that Arnaldo was willing to hold my aunt's birthday cake in the cooler until it was ready to be cut. Little things like that make for a more memorable experience. I will be going back with my husband so we can try other dishes and have a few mimosas!!",

However, the customers who walked in behind us, she acknowledged them and sat them down first, I'm guessing they were regular customers...? This was the beginning of a bad experience. My daughter was anxious to try the jupina drink, however our waitress said they ran out. She offered another drink similar to jupina, which was fine. There was 8 of us. She took forever to make 2 shakes, a coffee, a mojito and a water. Two members of our party came shortly after and they ordered another shake and water. We were starving and ready to put in our order, but somehow she insisted to make the shake and water that took another 10 mins first before taking our order. She finally took our order only to come back telling us they had only 5 empanadas left (our table ordered 7). She asked if my son wanted something else in place of the empanadas and he settled on white rice and beans. Two customers walked in after us and was able to get 2 cans of the jupina drink and so I asked our waitress why, especially when they came and sat down after us. She explained they had ordered their drinks before we did. All the other tables that came after us got their food and drinks way before we did. The food comes out 30 mins later, cold, and my son had what was rice and beans mixed together. I asked him if he was ok with it and the waitress heard me and said that they were out of white rice, never informing me about it. The place was so cold, we asked if she could lower the fan above us and she apologized and said that it was hot in the restaurant and everyone was hot. When we got the bill, I saw there was a charge of 7 empanadas and pointed it out to our waitress and she reminded us that the rice and beans were about the same price and in place of the empanadas. On the receipt there was a 3 % charge on paying with a credit card. Puzzled by this, I asked our waitress and she tells us that there was a notice posted at the entrance door about this charge. She rings up my bill and 10 mins later, hands me a receipt telling me she overcharged my card with the wrong amount, voided it, and recharges it with the correct amount, all this while it seems she was teaching her what seem to be 10 year old son on how to ring up and use the credit card machine. She never gave me the voided receipt, only the corrected receipt. Never have I experienced such bad service. Slow, deceitful, uninformative and careless service.",

Who laughs at customers who need something? My husband noted that his meat was incredibly dry, and I had specifically asked for my order to be cooked a certain way, and brought it up with the waitress. This girl had a pretty huffy attitude, didn't even apologize and at one point even uttered an incredibly sarcastic, \"Awwww, really?\" Rude, rude, rude. Normally we get a flan when we go to a Cuban restaurant, but we didn't stick around for dessert this time, since we were pretty appalled by the service and the horrible quality of the food.  I would have hoped things have gotten better since our last visit, but from the looks of some of these reviews, they haven't. Piece of Havana? More like Piece of Shit!",

    "text": "I want to rate this higher but sadly, this restaurant has disappointed me every time. Mostly in regards to service which is what Cuban restaurants are exeptional at in South Florida from my experience. The first time I visited I was told I needed a reservation even though restaurant was practically empty. We sat next door and while the waiter was nice, the food took over 45 minutes and then I get a notice that they ran out of white rice. How does a Cuban restaurant run out of white rice...with a practically empty restaurant next door?! The second time I visited they didn't have avocado, the black beans tasted burnt, and the service was far slower. I gave them a third try during the World Cup breakfast hours they promoted and everyone's order was wrong and the food that did come out (many orders didn't) took over an hour and a half. That is three strikes, so I have given up on this place being the Cuban food gem Charlotte so desperately needs.",

It kept getting in my straw and I had to constantly keep spitting it out. May come back for entertainment and perhaps a different drink.",

I took half the sandwich home to give to the dog. The roast beef on the sandwich was tasteless, very small amount of ham, and the Swiss cheese was there, but heated away outside of the sandwich by their sandwich press. So much mayo it dripped out when trying to bite the hard bread. I NEVER had nor put mayo on any Cuban sandwich I made or got in Miami. I didn't taste any pickles on it, either. I would have sent the sandwich back but I was with my son. I won't go back. I can cook my own Cuban sandwich much better. It's a nice place, the employees, are very professional & friendly.",

I opted for one of their skirt steak dinners, which arrived accompanied by a few plantains and two scoops of very tasty rice. Not a huge meal, but a decent portion. The steak was cooked perfectly, though the steak knife was appreciated. It was melt-in-your-mouth though not cut-with-a-fork. Great flavor with some spices but also the taste of the grill.  Service is excellent at keeping drinks refilled, clearing dirty dishes and generally staying on top of things without being annoying.  As we were leaving, the live music was getting set up. I understand that they also do some salsa dancing here. This place would be a perfect date night.",

The servers are friendly and always willing to explain the menu if you have questions.   For lunch, it gets a bit busy even when it's not full.  It's more of a sit down, and you may have to wait a bit.  But, things may have gotten better because dinnertime seemed to be almost quicker.  Maybe an extra chef?  Who knows. The food itself is great.  The lunch specials are good deals, but even the dinners are reasonably priced.  You can substitute sides, but I usually go with yellow rice and black beans.  The maduros are good and not too sweet.  I had the gaunabana shake which was a bit different.  Probably won't get it again, but it wasn't terrible. I'd definitely recommend this place to people who want something different, but it's a bit heavy so don't go if you are looking for something light.",

We have been to other Cuban restaurants before but not with the same atmosphere and flair as Taste of Havana. After a tasty Mojito, we started out with the calamari appetizer. It was very tender and seasoned well. We both agreed the sauce was so good, you almost wanted to eat it as a soup. For entrees. she had the fried pork chunks and I had the fried shredded beef. Both were equally delicious (we tried each other's entree). For desert, we both had the tres leches and Cuban coffee. A perfect compliment. There was also a live band which added to the ambiance. I was very pleased with the check as well. Drinks, appetizer, entrees, desert and coffee all for around $60.00 bucks including tip. We will definitely be coming back and bringing friends.",

Mine came correctly and hers came with yellow rice and black beans but no plantains.  It was corrected by the server promptly after I sampled mine and determined that they were too nice to pass up! So the pork was melt-in-your mouth tender with delicious mojo seasoning..... The rice and beans were tasty but the plantains were carmelized perfectly and complimented the dish amazingly.

The two of us got there at 7pm on a Monday night, were seated right away, there was 4 other tables with guests inside and 2 outside. Some were just having drinks. There were 2 servers, 1 bartender and 1 cook from what I could tell. We ordered within 10 minutes and we had the Starter Family meal that has a combination which is perfect for introducing someone new to Cuban food like my guest. We had , shredded Pork, Grilled Chiken and specialty thinly sliced, pounded sirloin. We also had Plantains, white rice and black beans.  We had to wait about 30 minutes after we ordered which seemed long given the low crowd in the restaurant. When the food came it smelled great but was luke warm and it almost seemed like they had forgotten about us given the time and temp ? I did not send the food back (which is rare for me) because it was all together. Despite the coolness, the food still tasted great. Full of Cuban flavors and in the end I was content. My guest also enjoyed the food but expected a little more. Over all I will recommend them but just plan on a long wait and be sure to get it at the right temp and you'll be satisfied.",

It took the server 45 minutes to take our order, two people at our table waited 15 minutes longer to get their food, beers were warm and mixed drinks ice was melted by the time it got to our table.  We would've said something but we only saw our server twice the whole time. I wish the server didn't add gratuity because she certainly didn't deserve it, not to mention adding gratuity automatically now is against the law for a few years now. Maybe if you didn't let your servers add gratuity I wouldn't be writing this review because she may have actually tried to do her job. The one positive was the band was pretty good.",

There was not a lot of seafood options of my liking, but I made do with was was there.  It was so so.  the fish I had was very tangy as if it was seasoned with lemon juice.  Everything else was good!

We finally waited so long that I got up and went to the bar because that was the only place I could see any of the staff. I told a waitress we'd been sitting for 15 minutes with no server, and she said she didn't know who ours was, but she'd find out. Apparently our waiter was also the bartender. He was really nice, but trying to find him at any point during our meal was like trying to find a needle in a haystack (until it was time to pay and then he was Johnny on the spot.)  Our food was good - we got beef/ham and cheese empanadas to start, and then I got the Havana Pork with plantains and boiled yucca, and the fella got the Fried Pork with rice and green beans - but our service was so terrible that it colored our whole experience.  To end on a positive note, they did have live music, which was a nice touch and not too overpowering.",

Waiters passed us by and NOBODY greeted us or bothered to tell anyone that we were waiting to be seated. In fact, a guest there called what seemed to be the owner's son to seat us. At that moment again no greeting and only said...ILL BE RIGHT BACK.  This was about a 25min wait while standing in front of the hosts podium!  Wife and I walked out. It was then when a woman ran out the door to call us back. That moment we decided to leave because of the lack of professionalism. Ok. So I gave it another try. This time with some buddies and my 25year old nephew. Well dressed but wear a baseball cap. We walk in and he was immediately told he must take hat off to enter.  Of course he took it off and held it in his hand.  While seated he was asked to leave if he was going to hold the cap in his hand. Mind you, HE TOOK IT OFF HIS HEAD but apparently having it in his hand was a big enough offence that he was asked to leave if he continued to hold it in his hand.  In all. There will not be a strike three because I WILL NEVER RETURN to this OVERATED so called establishment.",

Ropa Vieja was dry, clumpy & so bad tasting I couldn't eat it (and I have never not eaten a meal at a restaurant before). Also, I ordered the smaller portions and brought/charged for the more expensive portions. Same situation with my wife who ordered the steak which had a good sauce on it but the steak itself was practically tasteless. My kids ordered Cuban Sandwiches & Miami Sandwiches but the waitress came back to tell us that they had none. No Cuban Sandwiches at a Cuban restaurant? That should have been my warning sign. When the bill came, we were charged for 3 extra items and a hefty tip was already included. We informed her of the incorrect bill and she corrected it but left the same tip for the higher amount. Basically she gave herself a 28% tip! I corrected the tip but because I know how hard these people have to work for a living I still gave her a 20% tip. Waitress was nice and apologetic but service was mediocre at best. I know there are not many Cuban restaurants in the greater Charlotte area but still would drive past this one to get to another one much further away. I have never said this before but if you're thinking of going here, think twice about it. Honestly, I felt like it was a waste of money.",

    "text": "My daughter and I tried this place Sunday for the first time on a quest for the ultimate Paella. Unfortunately we didn't find it here.  In my opinion, there are two main criteria for a basic Spanish Paella since there are limitless variations out there floating around depending on what you want in it, albeit seafood, rabbit, pork, beef, chorizo, seem to be the norm.  The first of those two basics is cooking the dish in the traditional open shallow paella cooking vessel, usually carbon steel, which helps forms that wonderful socarrat as the rice starches caramelize during the cooking process. The second is the all important saffron for seasoning.   This paella had neither. There was no saffron flavor whatsoever and when the dish arrived within minutes of ordering I realized after looking at it it was assembled with a basic yellow rice adding the seafood (we ordered the Cubana version for two) at the last minutes. Obviously precooked.  The picture on the menu by the way shows two lobster tails, which makes it easier serving for two people but unfortunately it only came with one VERY small tail making it almost impossible to share. We were a little disappointed. On a scale of one to ten I gave it a five. The socarrat and saffron flavor just wasn't there.   On a positive note, the sangria was descent, if not a little weak, and the service was what you'd expect. Can't complain there.  Would I go back? Absolutely, there are several other things besides the paella I'd love to try!",

Unfortunately our main dishes were a little disappointing. I had ordered the crispy beef, came out a little cold along with the green beans and rice, that were also cold. Flavor of the beef was just 'ok', I expected a little more spice. My wife ordered the roasted chicken, and her plate came out cold also. After the plates were served our server never checked back. They only had a few people sitting at tables, so do not know what the problem there was. Perhaps the food sat too long prior to table delivery?   This restaurant has been here quite some time now so maybe they are starting to get a little complacent on their service and quality.   I doubt we will return because of that along with the other options in the close proximity that desires our business more.",

The only part of the meal i could tell was just made were the tostones. Living in Miami for the most part of my life this was definitely not the quality Cuban food Ive known and grown up to love.   The restaurant was clean and had nice setup. The service could of been better because my waitress surely seemed as if she didn't want to be there whats so ever. She barely attended my table and was more concerned speaking to her other coworkers about God knows what but it sure wasnt about taking care of her tables.

I did not have any disappointed guests and we came with 8 ppl. The havana sampler was amazing! Rice and black beans were just was I was looking for. However, the flan had too much strawberry glaze and a little to spongy but all in all great food and great music! Will return soon!",

The waitress told us they didn't have white rice or congri (what kind of Cuban restaurant doesn't have white rice????) and it would take over 1 hour to make it. Anyhow, we still ordered our food and they took almost 1 hour to bring our appetizer and another hour to bring our entrees. As we were waiting for  our food, we saw  many servers pass our table with dishes containing white rice in them. Our server was extremely rude and unresponsive, rolled her eyes and slammed the glasses and plates on the table. We usually give restaurants 3 chances whenever we don't have a pleasant experience. This is our 3rd and last visit. Each visit was worse than the precious one. We're never coming back.",

The waiter was unfriendly and didn't seem to want to be there. He never asked how the food was either. When my food came I started to eat. I noticed some thing was different about the steak but I couldn't put my finger on it right away. Then it hit me; the cheese! The cook put white American cheese on the steak, not Swiss like you are supposed to. The cook also put a tablespoon of red sauce on top of the cheese when it was supposed to be covered with it. The rice and beans were cold as well. Then the check came. It seems that they charge a 3% convenience fee for taking credit card payments. I paid my bill and I will never return to this restaurant. I'm done.",

However, I didn't like the first waitress attitude as the first thing she said to us was that they were closing at 10 (we sat down 9:10). Like it's not about to close for almost one more hour! After we ordered our drinks, a different waitress took our food order. She was nice & courteous, and remained with us for the remainder of the night.   We ordered the Empanadas as an appetizer, Chicken Hemingway (chicken wrapped in bacon), shrimp in garlic sauce and chicken alfredo as the entrees. The Empanadas and shrimp in garlic sauce were tasty. The Chicken Hemingway could have used more marinade and seasoning as it was kind of dry and bland.  The Chicken Alfredo was okay, just a different sauce that we are not used to. Overall, I would come back to hear the live music and try something different the next time.",

I truly enjoy bringing friends here, coworkers, clients, my boyfriend and family here. I recently moved up to Charlotte from Miami in January so your girl KNOWS her cuban food. Although I would not really classify this as 100% cuban eats - this place does have your Cuban staples and the savory flavors are undeniable.   I've tried their churrasco, roasted chicken (my fave when I ate meat) and most recently the grilled mahi-mahi. All were superb. Highly recommend any of these options if you are indecisive.   They also have a pretty extensive mojito selection which I have been dying to try!",

The first time I ordered the whole fried fish and it was over cooked and tasted as though it had been cooked in old oil, my plantains were over cooked as well.  my girlfriend ordered some dish that contained shrimp that weren't  de-veined.. The only reason I gave it a second chance was because  she loves their mojito's.. This last time I ordered Pollo a la Habanera, rice and beans, and plantains. The chicken was over cooked and lacked any seasoning at all.  She ordered Ropa Vieja.  It did not taste or look like it has other places.  She pushed her plate to the edge of the table and our server (Manuel) asked what was wrong.  She proceeded to explain that it did not taste as expected. He responded that it was their signature dish, then proceeded to ask what was wrong with it in a harsh tone.  I interjected and stated that it was different from what she had before and maybe the recipes were different.. He snatched the plate away and did not return for 40 mins.    The overall service was terrible.. We had to grab another member of the wait staff in order to get another drink, another member of the staff refilled her water, and I was never offered anymore tea by my server.  I kept my cool no need to get upset it wasn't worth it..   In conclusion.. I've had two bad experiences at this establishment and I love Cuban food.. I love food period. In order to get me to write a negative post you've really had to screw up..  The bright spot of the night was the entertainment though.. Loved the band.. They made the atmosphere very fun and pleasant..    If you're ever in the DMV you should look up Cuba De Ayers..",

    "text": "So I have been here multiple times and I would have given it a much higher review had I not had the experience I had last night. I suggested to a few girl friends that we have a Monday night girls night for Sangrias and dinner. I have been here before and the food is always good and the mojitos were always good so seemed like a winner. Well that's where I was apparently wrong.   Our waitress had to be the nicest WORST waitress in the history of the profession. Two of us got there at 5:30 and were seated at a table. We decided we'd like to move to a booth so we were waiting for the waitress to come back. This is where the night of waiting begins. We didn't get out of this restaurant until about 8:45 when it was all said and done. Every time she'd come by and say oh I'll be right back it became a minimum 30 minute wait. Took us over an hour to get our food not to mention the hour it took us just to get to order the food. The Sangrias were really bad. Tasted like concentrated juice (without added water) and really sweet off red wine. The empanadas were tasty and my friends chicken soup looked and smelled amazing. Our main courses came out not as hot as they should have considering the wait and one of the orders came out wrong. 3 of us ordered the crispy beef and somehow my friend got a different beef dish instead. I got a mojito after the bad sangria which I again didn't drink because the basil was discolored and slimy and it was really watered down. I have never had a bad drink here before so I'm not sure why it was this bad but something changed.   Now as I was watching I gather they only had 2 people working the floor and the bar last night so they were short staffed. I was prepared to just say okay they are having a bad day. We order dessert, she's picked up the pace here at the end, and the bar has shut down so pretty sure they wanted to close up shop. She brings us our bills and we notice that gratuity has been included already. Also it's a hefty gratuity (over 20%). For my one friend that was the last straw for her and she asked to speak to the manager. We asked if it was customary to add gratuity to a group of 4. He says yes this is what we do here. Then another friend asks but it says we are a table of 6 not 4 on our bills. So then he back tracks and says oh no she put it in wrong etc. (I feel here there is a language issue going on and want to give the benefit of the doubt but I probably shouldn't). The whole thing was a mess. We had an enjoyable night in spite of the bad service but that was due to good company. The food was good but definitely not as hot as it should have been considering how long we waited.   Overall I'm giving it 3 stars because I've been here before and the food, drinks, and service were good. However If I was basing it on last nights visit I definitely would give it 1 star. Also my tres leches cake was not very good... tasted like grocery store cake where the bottom had been soaked in condensed milk. This could be skewed because I've had amazing tres leches cake in Charlotte and this didn't live up to it.",

This is the first restaurant that I've been to in this city that puts fresh fruit in their mojitos, I recommend the strawberry and mango ones.  The decor and overall atmosphere is really enjoyable, we went on a Friday night when they had live Cuban music.  We were also told that later that night, they'd open up the dance floor for salsa night.  The service was very prompt initially, actually too prompt.  I've always had a pet peeve around being given my entree less than 5 minutes after you brought my salad out.  Other than that one slip up, the rest of the service that night was excellent.  The food was very fresh and tasty.  I had the calamari, chicken Caesar salad and the Havana Pork.  The calamari was very fresh and had a nice tangy dipping sauce on the side.  I only had a couple bites of the chicken Caesar before my Havana Pork came out, so I can't really comment on the salad since I just had them trash that.  The Havana pork was nicely seasoned and extremely tender.  Based on the way the pork was cooked, I'd recommend their pork dishes to anyone.  Pricing is very reasonable, most entrees run between $7-16.  If you're looking for good Cuban food, A Piece of Havana is a great place to go.",

He had extra chimichuri sauce brought out - not because he needed it, but because the sauce just makes your taste buds happy, happy, happy.  My Crispy shredded beef, again, was just delicious!  My daughter enjoyed her Shrimp Scampi.  We both had enough to take home for lunch the next day.  I recommend that you make certain to finish with their Cuban coffee.  When they bring out this tiny cup you think \"What the heck?\"  This little coffee will knock your socks off.  Wow!  Noone needs to drink more than one of these.  The flavor rocks! Any more than 1 cup would be too much.  Weekends there is a live band.  It can get loud with the band, but, just ask to not sit right next to them.  Or, you can even sit outside when the weather is nice.  Delicioso!",

    "text": "Firstly, this was my first visit.   Just to reiterate.....service is well below par. With that being said the food is meh. It is neither good nor bad. My boyfriend and I were hungry so we tried one of the combo platters made for two. It had steak (salty, chewy, and overcooked), chicken (seasoning was minimal and it also was overcooked) and lastly pork (this was the best meat on the plate). It also included white rice which was ok and some plantains. I ordered the empanadas....one beef and one chicken. This was the highlight of the meal. Beef was better but I did enjoy both. Lastly, you are supposed to get bread with the meal....like many restaurants it comes before your meal. I asked once we received the main course and our waitress said that they were out. Probably something you disclose at the beginning of the meal. Well come to find out, they were not out. I'm sure she noticed my unhappiness with this news and came out a minute latter saying that they would have it right out. So basically she lied.....not sure how you go from being out to all of a sudden having some stashed in the back???   Needless to say probably won't be coming back. If anything....I would order the $2 empanadas and call it a night.",

Had some croquettas for an appetizer they were ok not quite how I remembered them but not bad. For an entree I had the Havana pork which was much better than the appetizer. My wife had the Milanesa Steak and it was also good. A WARNING this is a Cuban restaurant and is going to have a laid back atmosphere. You will most likely not get in and out quickly. If you want to talk and have a few drinks this is a good place to do it while having decent Cuban food. But if you want a quick meal I would not recommend it. I gave 3 stars becuase although the food was decent I never felt the need to go back again.",

Drink orders were taken once, delivered, some to the wrong people, and almost never thought thought of again. When they finally took or orders (40 minutes after we arrived) it still took another 40 to be served.  The food was far from good either. The seafood and chicken in all the dishes was overcooked and tough. The only reason our drink and water glasses got filled was because all of us were asking. No one even came and asked how the meal was.  I spoke to the owners, a husband and wife, and while she was somewhat apologetic, she several times tried to lay the blame on our group for not telling them what to do. Hey, hears an idea - how about you the owner come over and see if everything is okay.  In the end we were served three complimentary flans, but it didn't make the situation any better, especially since the came out over cooked and burnt on the bottom.  I don't think any of us are ever going back.",

I have to admit I was skeptical at first but they had me at my first mojito!   The food is muy rica (delicious) and very on point with what Cuban food is. We started with the mariquitas (thin slices of crispy plantains) and they transported me to calle Ocho in little Havana!  I ordered my favorite dish- vaca frita and it did not disappoint. We ended with flan and tres leches for dessert. Since then we have gone back several times and had great experiences. Never a bad dish.  They have live music on the weekend (first was a great salsa band.. Another time was just a Latin dude and his keyboard).   Either way I am a fan and when I'm craving some good old Cuban cooking, that is where I head!",

The Ajiaco soup didn't have any pumpkin or chunks of meat, it was very bland. The roast pork was OK but needed lots more mojito and more onions. The masas de puerco (fried pork chunks) were cut into too small pieces, they were fried right but the chef failed to use any garlic which is a must for that dish. This restaurant doesn't even offer chicharrones de pollo which is like the best fried chicken in the world and the so called \"Cuban turnover\" was an Argentine empanada.   The sides were solid, the congri (rice and black beans) was not typical but way better than usual, the maduros (sweet plantains) delish and the tostones tasted like.... tostones.   Prices were very reasonable, portions were generous, service was cheerful and you better drink tons of water before bed to compensate for all that salt.   There's potential but the chef needs to get a lot bolder with his spice rack, mojito and garlic.",

I ordered the Havana Fantasy drink - and boy, do you get your money's worth!  That drink was strong!  It was very good - and it was $8 - so honestly, I was glad that I could taste the liquor I paid for.  I felt like this place was ok, and fine.  Then our food came...  I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce with Cuban toast and fried yuca.  That's the moment I became a total Piece of Havana fan.  The food was delicious!  The sauce and shrimp dish was just right, the bread was great, and the yuca was crispy and amazing.

I enjoyed the decor but I will say that their leather chairs were a bit uncomfortable.  Nothing like Cuba Libre in DC (amazing decor!) but for NC it is a great ambiance. Now about their food...    *sigh*  What a disappointment when I drove almost 2 hours to eat here. I got here about an hour before closing and I guess that wasn't enough time since our waitress was rushing us to order. We came here to have this GRAND experience and left with nothing but a decent steak sandwich that I ordered after my disappointing meal (that she put TOGO without asking and I had every intention of eating it in the restaurant). My mother started off with a sangria which she gave it an \"OK\" it was on the sweeter side but still a decent sangria. Between my parents they split a Paella (which was huge) but they had no lobster! It also came with no sides and cost almost 30 dollars. The Paella was good but not the best, the rice was not fully cooked and the clams were closed shut! I on the other hand ordered their garlic shrimp with yellow rice and sweet plantains..... and I will never order that dish again... ever. I figured out their special sauce! The shrimp was overcooked and was chewy and the \"special\" sauce overpowered the dish.... all I can say is... Mojo Criollo anyone?? The yellow rice was cold and all I enjoyed was my sweet plantains.   I will come back again with an ample amount of time and hopefully the food and service will be better. I love Cuban food and thats the only reason why I can't turn my back on this place just yet!",

The atmosphere was very nice, and we were looking forward to our meal.  Unfortunately, our waiter seemed as if he didn't want to be there. we waited about 20 minutes for drinks, and another 20 for him to come take our order (and he only came over because we were all staring expectantly at him). He never came to check on us once, unless we got up to get him, or flagged him down (which was difficult, as he never seemed to look towards the tables, instead keeping his head down over the screen to the POS ordering system).  Once the food came, everything was delicious, flavorful, and well prepared. Such a shame that the horrible service ruined it for us.",

I ate there at minimum once a week. While not quite as good, this place has been the closest I have found so far. Definitely a lot more upscale than my Atlanta spot, which had bars on the windows, but the food was really good and reasonably priced. I had a beef empanada and the Media Noche. The Media Noche was pretty good but the empanada was outstanding. If I had any room in my stomach, I would have ordered 2-3 more of them.  They place is tucked away at the end of a strip mall but now that I've found it, I'll be back.",

    "text": "I really tried to give this place a chance several times because I am of Cuban heritage and grew up to enjoy Cuban food. Each time I went with my mother who speaks fluent Spanish was great, but when I have gone by myself it was a whole different experience since I do not speak Spanish.   The first time, the service was so bad. The hostess had an attitude with us and told us we had half an hour to eat. Our waitress came to our table only twice. We ended up having to speak with a manager and she gave us a $15 voucher for the next time we came in.   So the next AND LAST time we came in we tried making a reservation for 8:30 and the man who picked up the phone kept telling us that they closed at 9. I told him we understood that but we were driving 2 and a half hours to eat at that particular restaurant. He then told us basically that by the time we got there we could not eat within 20 minutes. We got there anyway at 8:30 and were able to finish our meals by 9 no problem. Pretty sure the same man served our table.   We ordered the croquette and empanada platter. When it finally came out we received 5 empanadas and no croquettes. We were only informed then that there were no croquettes and we got 1 extra empanada. This did not seem fair because we were still charged the $9 for an uneven number of empanadas when there were two of us and we were supposed to get a total of 4 empanada and 4 croquettes. He then asked us how many empanada we would rather have and if he should take the extra one away. He almost grabbed the 5th empanada with his hand.   Our next peeve was that we specifically asked for the salted plantains instead of the sweet ones as our side and we got the sweet ones instead. He then told us that since we said plantain instead of tostone, we got the sweet ones. Right after that I saw him go up to another coworker with an attitude and point at our table.   Overall we will not be returning again and will take our business somewhere else. Being open until 9 does not mean you stop serving half an hour before and that you have a limited time to eat. I have worked in the restaurant business and if you cannot wait for customers to finish eating after the time you close then you should not be working there. Being tipped is based on the quality of service that is deserved. It's very poor management and extremely rude. It is such a shame.",

Every visit I have made to this restaurant the food has been delicious and except for my first experience the wait staff has been good.  What to try here:  The empanada sampler - they taste amazing and come hot fresh out of the oven! The dipping sauces served alongside the empanadas are a wonderful flavor addition. The Argentinian Parrillada with Malbec - I am going to venture a guess this meal would comfortably feed 3 instead of the 2 advertised. The real surprise when we ate this meal was that on a plate of meats, including steak, I have to say the chicken was the winner! I don't particularly care for bone in chicken but it was prepared perfectly with generous seasoning and every bite was juicy!  The Cuban sandwich - I can only get so excited about a sandwich personally but my fiance adores this sandwich and orders it consistently when we go for lunch.  Chicken Bacardi Alfredo - I am surprised to be saying this as well but my friend ordered this at lunch and I had some serious food envy! The Bacardi alfredo sauce was unique and delicious.  It's proven to be a solid date night location with large comfortable booths and consistently delicious food and drink specials. I am glad I went back and tried them again.",

Took forever to get menus and place drink orders. We just ordered everything at once when she finally came. With that said the food was really good, definitely no complaints there, everyone was satisfied with their food. Big portions too.

He was acting confused from the very beginning. I didn't understand that. I love when there is a language barrier because I feel like the food would be more authentic but not for this case. I ordered a Cuban sandwich. It was cold. The bread was dry and not even hot pressed. Ham was cold, mealy sliced tomatoes, mushy mess of ham croquettes, cheese had started to solidify. So opposite of what I was expecting. Also fries were soggy. I really wanted this place to be good because just moved from Wesley chapel and miss Bella Fresco Cafe and Gelateria in the Arboretum. Bella's I would have no problem recommending but not Piece of Havana.",

    "text": "Super disappointed! And after reading the first few post on Yelp we should have walked out! But we gave it a chance. Nothing like a \"Real Cuban Restaurant\" An hour before even getting there the phone rings...rings...or busy but when someone finally picked up and I asked I was put on hold forever and he NEVER came back on!! The hostess said it would take 45-to an hour wait. After an hour wait we are still waiting but we 2 big groups of people to sit. When I approach the hostesses reminding her I been waiting and I was there prior to those groups. I was told they had reservations lol!!! WOW!!!!  Finally we got to sit down to a table with nothing!!! No water!!! No Cuban bread with butter!!! Crackers!!!!NOTHING!!!!! 10mins later the waitress decided to show up. By this point we had our order ready. No \"oh give us a min\" we told her everything we wanted. When the food comes out she tells me they ran out of fried banana?! HELLO?! Seriously?! For the prices they charge the portions are small!!  My breaded steak was brunt, the chicken my step daughter got was super small and my husband steak was very skippy!!  Not sure why we ordered cafe con leche more or a disappointment!! It was rusty!! Then they only have just plain flan?! Once again even more disappointing!! I'm honestly convinced the owners are not Cuban this would have NEVER happen in Miami or Jersey!! This is why Cuban restaurant never make it here in Charlotte. Considering this is the ONLY!! One how they made it around this long oh yea because people do not know how bad it is!!!!",

It would have been a 1 star if we didn't start asking other servers for things (turned out our original server couldn't care less).   Having said that, the food was what brought me back - never had fried yucca before!  The second visit was a complete 180!  Our server was super-attentive and kept the cups full and checked up on us consistently and always with a smile.  The food was again amazing - I could seriously eat their chimichurri sauce out of a bowl.  This time there was a live musician and the atmosphere was electric - people got up to dance in the front as well!  The coolest thing I noticed was that most of the tables were larger groups - which probably aided in the festive atmosphere.  You'd be a fool to not try their fried yucca and if you're really going for that food coma- definitely get the tres leches for dessert!!",

The only reason I didn't give perfect 5 was because the space is very small and crowded and I ordered a sampler plate so that I could try multiple items, and the roasted pork was AMAZING, the steak was \"good\", but the chicken was \"blah\".... We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and he and I both had a wonderful time-- the band was absolutely amazing, the vibe made us feel like we were in Little Havana in Miami, everyone- patrons included- were happy and lively and having a wonderful time. If only they had a bigger space so that you didn't feel so crowded it would have been perfect.  And again, the food was delicious, over all, but I feel on a sampler plate where they have chosen the best of the best authentic items for your to sample, everything on the plate should be outstanding. The chicken was really dry and wasn't seasoned....the steak, again, was good, but not great....the star, by far was the roasted pork...OMG!! Soooooooo Amazing! I truly hope they expand and open another one of these somewhere else in Charlotte, as I feel it This cuisine and culture is missing here(and I live in Mint Hill, so SteeleCreek is kinda far for us to get to).  Can't wait for an opportunity to return....",

Although, the restaurant was never totally full during our time there.   There was PLENTY of staff to go around, but it still took a very long time for our server to approach. We placed orders, no problem, but almost never saw our server for the rest of the night. Others came around to top-off our drinks...at one point, topping off my diet soda with sweet tea. Somehow, our absentee server saw this happen and brought a replacement, which was nice.   Food was just okay. The Cubano is not the best I've had, and the fried yuca was disappointing. We never did get silverware, and only got napkins because a bus boy spilled water on us. Also took ages to get the bill, which turned out to be for a different table. So we had to hunt down our sever again and have her fix   Overall, the place is clean, staff is friendly enough, and they have good live music some nights. Maybe they are better on a regular night. I doubt we'll go back, though.",

This is not normal for this dish.  The yuca was very undercooked and tough to cut/chew. Plantains were great, but also pretty hard to mess up.  All said, the price was great at $6.95 but flavor and quality were very low too. Too bad because they have a great atmosphere for sitting in a strip mall area.",

This place has some character, is comfortable and is a lot nicer looking than I was expecting.  I ask one of the waiters about Cuban Style Espresso and told me to try something else.  I do not speak much Spanish so I have no idea what it was, though the name sounded really good and he seemed confident that I would like it.  Since I believe \"Fortune favors the Bold\" I thought I would see how I liked it.  This Coffee with milk had a good (not great) flavor and it was better than many, though miles from the Great Cuban Style Espresso I'm used to!  What he described as their approach to Espresso Cuban Style sounded close (close but not quite) and I probably should have ordered it and will next time.  OK I know I'm crazy and I do not speak Coffee, so I'm part to blame!  They serve their Cuban Sandwich with Mayonnaise, yet you can choose to have it with none as I did!  This Cuban Sandwich was very good, the pickles were thick, the mustard could have had a less dominant presence though I'm not counting that against it!  Swiss Cheese, Ham and Pulled Pork, YUM!  This sandwich gets 3.85 yelp stars, because I am almost a fan.   Instead of Fried Potatoes (french Fries) I substituted ($.99) fried Plantains (the sweet kind).  The Plantains were perfect...5 yelp stars!  Soup of the day was Corn (Not the Creamy style) I guess it was a broth or water base, was flavored nicely and had some meat in it, 3 yelp stars.  The service was Superboy on Cuban and if you do not know that is a compliment.  They made one small mistake on my order yet fixed it before it left the kitchen and I know they don't think I saw it.  They put fries on the plate and my server caught it before he picked up the plate to bring it to me.  Five Stars for Service!",

Long version: Went there with the family over the holidays for the music and to get a taste of home. Having grown up in the restaurant business (a Cuban one at that) and relocating from South Florida; it is mad hard to find a decent Croqueta in Charlotte. Such a staple in typical cuban bakeries yet, apparently in Charlotte, bakeries are not licensed to fry foods so coming across a Croqueta in this town is already a challenge.  Anyway, I was excited to try this place out, especially since they call themselves \"Authentic\". We arrived on a Saturday night and the music was going. We very much enjoyed the musicians and even did a little dancing. That is where the highlights end.  We ordered 2 samplers (which have my very sought after croquetas), a Vaca Frita, Rabo Encendido, a Miami sandwich and Mojitos. The Rabo encendido was very tender and well seasoned. The Vaca Frita however, was over cooked and bland. The Miami Sandwich, though it had slightly different ingredients than the typical, was pretty good. The samplers however were extremely lack luster. The croquetas were mushy and almost smashed looking. The other items were just \"ok\".   The mojitos were pretty watered down but were much better after we asked the bartender to re do them.    Overall, go for the live music. The dishes are hit or miss and the service can be slow but friendly and accommodating.",

The ambiance, service, and food was everything I had hoped for. We had a fabulous dinner, including ropa vieja, churrasco, Cabernet, and two cortaditos. Not to mention, we were greeted by the manager and owner to make sure we were enjoying our experience. My boyfriend and I are foodies, and find it difficult to enjoy a restaurant that can deliver a great meal, at a fair price, and great service all at the same time. But, I am happy to report that \"A Piece of Havana\" knows how to do things CORRECTLY. Can't wait to go back and enjoy some of the other food items. We were completely satisfied!",

    "text": "This was my second time visiting here but first time reviewing. My parents were in town and we tried to go previously on a Sat night but they were completely booked for the whole weekend.   So .. I made sure to make reservations on OpenTable this time and we made our return  We were seated with no issue. I recommend first getting the havana sampler it allows you to sample empanadas, fried yuca, tamales and more.   We ordered drinks. The sangria is delicious and their mojitos are some of the best. I also had a Mangotini which was good but it was so small it was laughable.   For the food my parents split the Parrillada Cubana a combination platter with food enough for two. They got their bang for their buck with it. I got the Milanesa bistec with rice and plantains. I LOVE their plantains and my stepdad even ordered some more for dessert.   They had live music which started at 7 that night and our reservation was at 6. The band was pretty cool. Our food probably took 20-25 or so mins to come out but we didn't mind since we had drinks and were wanting to be there when some of the music started. On a regular day though the wait time would be unacceptable.   We also went to have some dulce de leche cake for dessert however they were out of it which was disappointing.   Overall, the food was good, seasoned well, a good amount, the service was okay, and it is definitely somewhere to come if you want to experience a different atmosphere.",

However, our second experience was not as great as we remembered. We couldn't remember which steaks we ordered our first time here (we did remember it had chimichurri sauce on it) so we ordered the Churrasco and Palomilla. I asked for my dish (Churrasco) to be cooked medium and it was served to me well-done, so I had to ask for another plate. The steak was okay, but I thought the Palomilla tasted a lot better. Overall, the food was good and the service was okay. I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because our first experience deserved 5 stars and our second deserved 3.",

    "text": "I went here like 3 years ago with some co-workers.  I've spent sorta a lot of time in s. florida, and for years the only Cuban food I've eaten came from refugees.  There's not generally a lot of it (cept in Miami) and good cuban is amazing, so I like good cuban food and I don't really bother with crappy cuban food.  So couple three years ago when a bunch of rednecks from the warehouse area of Charlotte suggest \"cuban\" I almost stopped them, but I was in a good mood so I let it go.  I didn't have any reason to expect much.  After the meal I remember thinking, at the time, that this place was too good to be in Charlotte.  I finally got a chance to come back tonight.  My family is here with me, we're killing time in Charlotte, and my wife loves cuban food.  We popped in, she eyeballed the menu, we went for it.  There was a singer in tonight; she was pretty legit cuban, thick accent and all.  And *very* good.  Like \"is this candid camera\" good.  She was beltin' em out for 1.5 hours (we hung around after our meal), and still at it when we left.  A few into her set she dedicated (in English) a song to the kitchen, then repeated in Spanish.  After the translation they erupted in applause, so I guess the kitchen is cuban too.  The food was over-the-top amazing.  Crispy vaca frita, SUPER tender and juicy.  Black beans + rice were great, maduros as well.  My wife won't stop talking about the empanadas.  After, when we ordered dessert (flan) and coffee, our waitress (\"Estephanie\" lol) asked \"cuban coffee?\"  It's sorta like gauging a barbecue place: you order tea, and if they bring out sweet tea you know it's legit.  If they ask (\"Sweet or unsweet?\") it's touristy but probably ok, and if you get unsweet then you should probably eat elsewhere.  I always ask for \"coffee\" in cuban restaurants, and north of Miami I just get crappy coffee.  Here it was the real thing -- absurdly strong and sweet.  Just like the rest of the experience, it DID NOT belong in a strip mall outside Charlotte.  This place is the real deal.  If you are at all curious about what cuban food (or people) is like, please come try it.  Prices are great ($12 entree!!!), service is great, everything is genuine.  This is now going to be a required stop when we're in town or driving through.",

Found within which warm friendly atmosphere, extraordinary service, and drinks that will have you ready to get up and try your steps. Initially thought of being good and simply ordering a caesar salad, but the lure of oxtails won me over, and oh, was I happy that I made them change. Their oxtails were tender, extraordinarily seasoned, and pleasing to the palate.. A taste of the empanadas also proved to be a wise choice, especially the beef. The washing is down with the cool crisp mojito, I was ready to try my Latin two step on the dance floor with everyone else... Come on down on Friday night and get your tastebuds pleased and your dance step on at a Piece Of Havana.",

Came to this restaurant after a long day at Carowinds and was hoping to get in and get eating because we were so hungry. We go to the restaurant and waited a couple minutes for hostess to help us. We were checking out the money and debating whether or not to say because there was a wait, but hostess told us of the next door lounge that is same food, but in different environment. We went next door hoping to be served quickly, but similar situation arose. Finally after being seated we were quick to decide, but didn't have much help with questions on the menu. Waiter was kind, but wasn't informed on the menu as well as he should have been. Food came and I was expecting a hot dish of sea food, but it instead came out cold and he said that is how it is supposed to be, but there was no mention of this on the menu. Food was alright, I really liked the plantain chips and we still had a good time with the music playing and the neat looking building. I probably wouldn't come back unless I heard of changes in the speed of service.",

I ordered the boiled yuca in sauce and my friend ordered the croquettes as an app.  The croquettes came out steaming hot unlike my yuca which was ice cold.  I had to send it back, 1st strike!  I ordered the only vegetarian option (disappointing); my friend ordered the ropa vieja, and again the meat dish came out steaming hot and my dish again was cold and not to mention the plate had more rice than vegetables and my maduros were black!    As the waitress brought my yuca back to the table, I just handed her back my plate and said, \"this is cold too\"!   After a few minutes, enough for me to eat my yuca, my plate came back out, this time the presentation was different but that is besides the point.  The food looked hot and was hot however they simply just took the maduros from the cold plate and put back into the new plate..... I took maybe 2 bites, only to be completely dissatisfied!  The vegetables tasted sour and of burnt garlic, not to mention the maduros were previously burnt and now cold and I even had one that was literally a rock!",

Food was SPECTACULAR (huge portions)!  The vibe is really cool.  We went on a Friday night and they had a group performing. There is a small dance floor where patrons could salsa and mambo.  It was so much fun!  If you're nearby, be sure to check it out.",

On my second visit here, I just went with something listed as a favorite on the menu and it was decent, just not something I was expecting.  On my most recent visit, I asked my server for a recommendation and he recommended a shredded beef dish.   Now I am not a big beef eater but this dish was absolutely amazing.  The crispness of the beef is what did it to me along with the chimichuri sauce.  For a side item, get the green beans!  They are very flavorful.  The fried Yuca was good too but I've had better at a Peruvian place.  I spent a little time talking to my server and I think this is a place I will bring the dinner group very soon.  I've never been here for dinner and some of their menu options they only offer for dinner so I am looking forward to trying them.  One odd thing,  The chairs here are custom made.  The backs and seats seem to be made out of leather.  The only problem is that I sunk down a bit when I sat down.  I felt like I was sitting in a hole.  But that's the only flaw I saw with my latest visit.  Good stuff.  Check it out sometime!!!",

I ordered the roasted chicken with mixed rice/black beans and plantains.  I think the dish was $5.95 which is a great price.  However, I was a bit disappointed in the chicken - it was tasty but a rather small portion. Sadly, the mixed beans& rice was a bit dry and did not have a lot of flavor.  The plantains were good though.    On the plus side, the service was very good and the food was delivered  super-quick.   This place is not bad overall and if I happened to be in the area I would probably give them another try.",

It's a trek from where we live in Dilworth, but I'd say it's damn worth it. Located off of South Tryon past Carowinds, It's in a small shopping center, but as it's own building.   We stopped in on a Saturday night and we were greeted with live music. It was awesome. The guy was singing his heart out and I'm happy to say that he was really good. It wasn't unpleasant at all. Actually added to the ambiance.  We started out with the avocado dip (basically guac) with fried plantains. Dude. I'd highly recommend getting this. The dip is pretty commonplace with other guac varieties, but the fried plantains make for a really nice change-up from plain corn chips. We cleaned the plate between the three of us.   I went with the Cuban sandwich. I have to order it any time it's offered at a Cuban place. Happy to report it's a textbook sandwich. Flaky Cuban bread, yellow mustard, Swiss, pork, ham, dill pickles. That's all you need. Ordered it with a side of tostones. Mashed, and fried plantains served with \"mojo.\" Basically an oily, garlic-y dipping sauce. It's amazing. Super mild and a nice touch.  We also ordered a couple of the gin mojitos. Have to give these a big \"meh.\" It's a great idea, but the grenadine really killed the flavors. It was just too heavy.  Service was incredibly friendly and cordial. The place was packed and the guys on the floor took care of everyone with a smile.   Cuban dinner round #2: Coming very soon.",

The meal was swimming in garlic. Almost literally. I didn't finish because it was so garlicky. Pretty sure I am going to smell like garlic tomorrow. However, I do love some garlic, so this will not deter me from coming back.   I also got the house made sangria. It is $3 on Monday which I think is a good deal. For all of you beer lovers a pint of Coors light is $2 everyday. Back to the sangria, it was ok. Vey sweet, but a good compliment to the meal.   I thought our service was great. If I could just rate our waiter I would give him a 5 out of 5 stars. Very attentive and helpful with making our decisions.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Piece of Havana, but was instead horribly disappointed. This place fell flat in every single way it could.  Let's start with the service.  It was severely lacking.  There was barely anyone (only 2 other tables) in the entire restaurant and it still took an obscenely long time to get anything, from our initial drink orders to refills to even our food.  If they were slammed I could understand, but the waitstaff spent most of the time chit chatting or watching one of the TV's mounted on the wall.  Now, the food.  I don't believe my standards are unrealistic.  There's plenty of good Cuban food to be found outside of Miami, all it takes is a little effort.  Also, it shouldn't be overpriced.  We're not talking foie gras or lobster here.  Sadly, this place suffered from both bad and expensive food.    First of all, the Cuban salad was a joke.  It was the bare minimum needed to be considered a salad and clocked in at 8 dollars.  There wasn't even a dollar's worth of ingredients on the plate.  Then there was the Vaca Frita which should have been called Vaca Greasy.  It was served in a little bowl swimming in grease and fat.  There was nothing Frita about the dish with all the meat hanging limp and dripping oil.  The chimichurri sauce was equally greasy and unappealing.  I'm not even going to talk about the rice and beans (a staple dish of any Cuban restaurant).  Suffice it to say, I've had better at Taco Bell.  The one thing they did well where the Mariquitas and the avocado dip.  That's it.  The best part of the entire depressing meal was the appetizer.  This was a bad experience across the board.  I don't understand why such little effort was put into what could otherwise be a fantastic place.  The decor is great, they have a solid looking menu, and the right ambiance, but it fails at the very essentials of any restaurant, food and service.",

After we were seated we waited 20 minutes and no one had even came to our table to greet us. So my boyfriend got up and went to the hostess who came to our table to take our drink and appetizer order. Another 10 minutes past and a guy that seemed to be our waiter brings us our drinks and ask if we wanted appetizers to which we told him yes that we had already ordered them. Another 20 minutes later we received  our appetizers. A little crazy as we have now been there for over 40 minutes. We quickly ordered our entree when our \"waiter\" brought the appetizer because we didn't know when we would see him again. We waited another 20 minutes no food. The staff looked disorganized with their full attention on a large party celebrating a birthday. I needed some air so I walked outside and told my boyfriend if our food is not here in 10 minutes we are leaving. He talked with the \"waiter\" who went to get the food. Finally at last a Christmas miracle came and our food came over an hour after we arrived. By this point I was over it and over the lackluster food. Never again. If I was completely exhausted and hangry I would have spoken with the manager.",

To begin with we arrived at 5pm, restaurant had a few patrons. Asked to be seated at a booth and was told they couldn't as it was reserved for someone at 6:30 pm. REALLY? You're going to deny paying customers a seat because the booth is reserved 1 hour and a half later?? Makes no sense - in the end we got the booth but were warned that we would have to be done by 6:30 - fine! Ordered the shredded beef dinner entree and my husband the skirt steak and we both agreed we'd never eaten something so bland and tasteless at a Latin Restaurant before. Had to order salt, pepper and hot sauce to pour it on and see if it picked up a semblance of flavor. Totally unhappy with both our meals - we are definitely NEVER going back. Oh and the icing on the cake - I ordered a drink (which the menu stated \"in a martini glass\") they forgot to add the word \"mini\" in front of martini glass. Yes, the drink came in a MINI-Martini glass. I actually asked the waitress \"Excuse me, did the bar run out of martini glasses or is this what your drinks regularly come in?\". She said it's what they typically come in - SMH. In the end, waited.....waited....waited....waited for our waitress to appear. Had to flag down a different waiter and asked him to please find my waitress as I needed the check. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. Not sure how this place actually has positive FOOD ratings - maybe I caught them on an off day? Every single time I've been there?",

    "text": "The first thing that impressed me was the daily specials. In my opinion, that is never a bad idea, especially on drinks. They had a decent bar selection and their mojito came highly recommended. I love Cuban sandwiches, so I couldn't wait to try the \"Milanese\", a breaded beef steak or chicken breast, with lettuce, tomatoes, ham and cheese in Cuban bread. They use American cheese in the sandwich and when I tried to order it with Swiss or Jack (my twist) the server looked confused and slightly hesitated, so I just let it ride with the American cheese as-is. My friend ordered the homemade chips and guacamole and it was really good. My sandwich was good, it came with a side and they featured a good bottled beer special that night. We also got a mojito and it was actually as good as word of mouth. The Menu appetizers include Papa Rellena (Stuffed Potato with ground beef), Empanadas and Tostones Rellenos de Camarones. Entrees include such specialties as Arroz con Pollo, Bistec de Palomilla, the very popular Paella from Spain (a seafood mix with Saffron yellow seasoned rice cooked with beer) and ropa vieja (Shredded Beef) a traditional Cuban dish. They have a decent selection of wines, Latin-American cocktails, domestic and imported beers as well as their famous Mojitos. They also have Cuban style sangrias by the glass and by the pitcher.   The design of the dining room is a re-creation of the early 1900's in Havana, Cuba. Although it's not as authentic as it could be, It does create a warm and cozy feel. The chandeliers make the room sort of dimly lit and romantic. There is a lot of Cuban art on the walls and they play Cuban music for background ambiance through the week, with live music and DJ's on the weekends. This seems like the type of place my man Ernie Hemingway would have visited in La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana to get loaded on Mojitos and Daiquiris, then fall into a hammock and scrimshaw a few classics. Ah yes, Big Ern was a wild boy. No doubt. A Piece of Havana features live music every Friday & Saturday from 7PM to 10PM. Fridays are \"Havana Nights\" with a DJ spinning International music. If you're not too familiar with Cuban cuisine, start with sandwiches and salads and work your way up the menu.",

There were a few hiccups though; while service was friendly, it took a long time to get our lunch and my portion was on the small side. I was actually kind of hungry when I left, which is never a good sign.  Looking at other photos on Yelp it may have just been my entree- so maybe next time I'd opt for rice instead. I also thought the tostones were bland & the green beans next to them were super salty. My best guess is maybe they just salted the green beens twice instead of both of the side dishes? Anyway, I would definitely give them another shot-as overall the main dish did taste good & they have some great sounding cocktails on the menu.",

If you are familiar with it and enjoy it, you'll like this place.   I'm native to the Tampa Bay area of Florida so I'm quite familiar with the cuisine. The food here is excellent and seasoned well, the atmosphere is quite beautiful and the staff is personable. I had the Palomilla Sirloin Steak and it was delicious. Their homemade tres leches cake is also intensely delicious (extremely moist yet not mushy), and their Cuban shakes are very good too.",

It happened to be kids eat free night and I ordered the items from the kids menu. My discount dining dollar value for a meal at up to $12. I ordered a meal for myself which was just under $17 and an additional meal for $12.95. A few minutes later the waiter came back and said I would not be able to order from the kids menu because I couldn't use a dining dollar discount certificate and get the kids meal free. I said OK I will order something else. I ordered a meal for $9.95 for the kids to share. I knew that once I presented my discount certificate that the service would be somewhat poor. The waiter never came to check on us. I had to call on another waiter to go and get him when my daughter needed to refill her drink. He never came and asked us if we need anything else. He never asked if we wanted desert or anything but showed up with a box and the check and proceeds to tell me that he only took off 9.95 and not the 12.00. Ridiculous. I tried to protest and he gave me a so sad too bad look. There are just way too many restaurants here in Charlotte for me to give them my business. The food was OK.",

There is nothing authentic about it. There were 8 of us at the table and no one liked their food. The appetizers were so low on salt that they didn't taste like anything. Our entrees were all cold and taste was horrible. You could tell the food was not fresh and just been reheated upon serving. Honestly, it is a shame that the food is not good as their ambiance and music is amazing. In my opinion the owners should really look into having better quality when it comes to food. Also, although the service from our waiter was good, it did seem they were very pushy all the time asking what else were we going to order when we really wanted to take it slow. Have some appetizers at first and drinks. Then order our entrees, after all a place like this is inviting for you to stay the night consuming and dancing. Yet it seemed like they wanted us served and out. Mind you, we were a party of 8 consuming and there was no waiting line of people wiating to come in. Honestly, I would love to go back only for their music but would definitely not eat here again. I really hope one day they actually serve good authentic Cuban food with quality as this would probably help the business a lot.",

They had live music on the night we were there which was a Friday. If you are looking for a quick meal this is not the place as we were there about 1.5 hours from start to finish.

Came with 4 (3 different) delicious empanadas...ham, chicken, and beef.  The avocado dip was perfect and came with plantain chips that I could have eaten by itself.  Split the shredded beef and Milanese chicken entrees.  Both very good...I couldn't decide which one I like better.  Side of sweet plantains and yellow rice were both delicious.  We all agreed the yellow rice was better than the congri.  Had tres leches cake for dessert and was perfect.  I am a chocolate lover and preferred this cake over the chocolate crepes that we also ordered.  Only complaint was one person had the pork and it was a little overcooked.  Overall great food and live music was a plus.  Can't wait to go back!!",

The best days to go if you're into entertainment while you dine are Fridays and Saturdays. On these nights, a live salsa band performs salsa versions of greatest hits. I would recommend making a reservation as it can get extremely crowded on these nights. The waiters are all very friendly. The drinks are good and well priced. The spotlight here is the food. The empanada platter is very good (it comes with 4 empanadas and 4 croquettes. I usually get the Crispy beef which is delicious with the chimichurri sauce on top. The churrasco is also very good.

We got here right around 7pm when the music was about to kick off. I was impressed because they had a decent size band playing live music!  I ordered a coconut mojito and my husband got a Dos Equis. The coconut mojito was very tasty and had shredded coconut on top. It wasn't very strong at all....not sure how much rum was in it!   We decided to get the Havana sampler for a tizer and then split the shrimp in garlic sauce for the meal. The sampler was pretty good. However, most of the food was fried. Not really my style. I did like the plantains a lot though! The shrimp in garlic sauce was delicious though! That sauce was so yummy. For our sides we got black beans and green beans. Both were pretty decent and nice portion sizes!   The band was awesome and definitely the highlight of the evening!",

She personally remembers it cause she wrote it down. I assured her that neither i nor anyone else had called and canceled it. She went next door and found us seats. Place is really nice and they have music but the service yesterday was horrible.. got appetizers after 45 min of getting our drinks. The food came in probably 45+ min later. I had to chase the waitress to bring us more drinks and she only brought us 1 of the 3 drinks we ordered... she never came back withthe other 2 drinks. I never even bothered her again about them as we were getting ready to leave anyway. The. I had to chase her for the check and a box. 20 min later i had to ask another waitress for them as my baby started to cry now!! It was way past her bedtime ( we left there @10 pm).",

Very bad service. Bar was rowdy and they had three large parties going on at the same time. We tried to get a drink at the bar, but bartender never acknowledged us. We scrambled to get a menu while we waited but hostess was too busy and snotty. Reservations are required or a must. I will not be coming back here.

    "text": "After a recent visit to FL and enjoying a great Cuban meal there, we decided our craving for Cuban food was worth 30-mile drive to give Piece of Havana a try.  We were not disappointed!  We started the meal with two mojitos, and a pork empanada for me and the soup of the day for my hubby (Ajiaco Cubano for Saturday).  I loved the empanada - it was the perfect portion, it wasn't too greasy, and the pork filling was very flavorful.  My hubby also enjoyed his soup which was full of meat.  For our entrees, I had the fried pork chunks with white rice and plantains.  The rice was nicely flavored (with butter?), the pork was crispy but a tad dry, and the plantains were nicely cooked and not too sweet.  This was a great value for $9.95.  My hubby had the crispy shredded beef with yellow rice and black beans for $10.95.  His rice was just as good as mine, and the beans were well flavored.  We actually preferred each other's entrees, and so we switched halfway through.  His beef was topped with a delicious chimichurri sauce that made the dish for me.  We didn't have room for dessert, but we had to try their Cuban coffee.  Basically, it's sweetened espresso.  They were a tad sweeter than I prefer, but the coffee was good and strong.  Service was fast and efficient.  The dining room is also very nice, and we had a spacious booth for the two of us.  I haven't tried any other Cuban restaurants in CLT yet (really, there aren't many!), but given the great food, prices, and service, we'll definitely make a return trip to PoH very soon!",

    "text": "I grew up in South Florida and have a Cuban mom so I know Cuban food. Unfortunately A Piece of Havana does not quite get Cuban food right. I am not saying the food is bad. It is just not Cuban. Other reviews here who claim to be Cuban or from South Florida and give this place rave reviews, I am not sure what Cuban restaurants or food they ate.  Let me give you a few examples. Their Cuban sandwich has mayonnaise in it. Cuban sandwiches do not have mayonnaise in them. They douse their Palomilla steak with Chimichurri sauce. Palomilla steaks do not have Chimichurri sauce. They put soggy onions on their Palomilla steak. Palomilla steak is supposed to have either raw onions or lighly cooked but still crispy onions on it. They put raisins in their Picadillo. I have never ate at any other Cuban restaurant that they put raisins in their Picadillo (although I have been told that some Cubans do cook it this way). And their white rice is completely off. Lacks the flavor or consistency of real Cuban white rice. If you want an example of Cuban/Colombia white rice done properly, head over to Los Paises instead (which BTW is great and truly authentic Colombian food).  To me it seems like they have \"Americanized\" their meals so it lacks the True Cuban authentic feel and flavor. Again the food is not bad, but it is just not \"Cuban\" to me.  I have been to A Piece of Havana many times throughout the years. I always go back hoping it improves since unfortunately we don't have many other choices here in Charlotte when it comes to Cuban food, but I always come away disappointed. The service and food quality is also very inconsistent. I can say that some of my meals here have actually been very good and they did get the rice right, but most of the time it is mediocre and the rice is completely off. One time we were seated and had to leave after waiting for 20 minutes when no one even came by to take our drink order.  I also made the mistake of coming here once on a Friday night. They had a live band going and we were seating right next to the band. It was extremely loud and we could not even hold a conversation. As other reviewers pointed out, you don't need a bunch of amplifiers and speakers for such a small space.  Ultimately this place down in South Florida would close pretty soon after it opened as it wouldn't even compare to some of the even more mediocre places. I am not expecting a Versailles or even La Carreta, but would love to see something on the level of a Latin America Cafeteria. Too bad this is not it. Ever since Carlos Cafe closed down, I have not been able to get a decent Cuban meal in Charlotte.",

On several occasions we visited and was told there weren't any available tables because of the tables were reserved, yet there only a few people in the restaurant. I guess my question is, if you arrive at 6:30 and a table is reserved for 8:00, I don't understand why one can't be seated and served and out by the time the table is needed.",

Getting there, ordering, receiving food, and getting the checks is over an hour ordeal, and I don't know how many more times I can go here before I get called out on it...  Anyways, the food is usually pretty decent. I got the crispy shredded beef, and it was drenched in oil. Soaking. I don't know if anybody else has had this problem, but it definitely dissuades me from ever ordering this again. Flavors were altogether good on this though! The plantains were nice and crispy on the outside, but the yucca was seriously under seasoned. Just kinda a disappointing experience. Not enough to never make me come here again, but it's going to be low on the list of places I want to return to.",

The fries weren't crispy and had the sandwich had more pork on it, it might've been worth almost ten dollars. I'll give it another chance, tho. Overall, the sandwich was good and everyone deserves a second chance.",

We were told that the kitchen was very busy and it also depended on which wait staff got their tickets in first. Never heard of such thing. My friend wanted to order fish and was told they \"ran out\". She was very disappointed. By the time the food came out I was not hungry anymore. They had live music which was great. Wish they had this all night over the DJ.  I was told they would move the tables so that you can have a dance floor but they never moved the tables. The small dance floor was so crowded you can barely move, people bumping into you practically knocking you down because they wanted to take up the whole dance floor. Very disappointed! Won't be back.

The owner called us unreasonable. She then changed her story and blamed her receipt printer malfunction for double-charging three separate checks.   The amounts have not cleared yet and she has finally agreed to a refund, but the issue lies that until the banks open, all that money is still on hold.  I understand that mistakes happen and it was a busy night. We simply wanted things to be made right, not to be fed False excuses. Therefore accept the issue and try to make it right instead of resulting derogatory remarks. The owner has even gone as far as to search for my family members on Facebook, screenshooting pictures to text them to us as a warning to never return.  We had a good time and we were even going to overlook the lackluster food and poor service, but unfortunately this will definitely have us never returning again--even before we were threatened. I even left a $20+ tip because I tried to be understanding. I now regret it. What a shame, I truly believed they were an asset to the community. I would share the texts from the owner and pictures of my bank account, but unfortunately I can't in this review.",

Food was good... atmosphere was great... and the musicians were playing passionately  add my 2 glasses of Tempranillo and it was beyond lovely. Only thing I wish was that they had more tables available. It was a bit strange to see all the tables in the center of the restaurant completely empty on a Friday night- and to have to leave earlier than we would have liked due to a reservation coming in. (We were still super grateful they sat us for the hour and a half we had there though.)  Really fun dinner experience, will definitely be back next time I'm in town.",

Today I took guests without mentioning my first experience.  To start the service is horrible and extremely slow. I do not mind waiting if it's worth it and it wasn't.  We order vaca frita, white rice, black beans. Another order was roasted pork with maduros and black beans and another was  chicken with yellow rice and tostones. The white rice was hard, the black beans came straight out if a can and you couldn't tell which was roasted pork or vaca frita. The chimichurrie sauce also didn't have flavor. It wasnt worth the wait  to be served or orders taken and it wasn't even good food or Cuban. My main point for writing this review is so people realize this is Not what cuban food tastes like and I'm disappointed to think many in Charlotte are walking away with this impression.  Save your time, money and taste buds!",

Horrible service ..Poor management!!!Went there for dinner and drinks on a Friday night at 8pm with a group of friends..Everything was going good until about 1030 when we were approached by an employee who I really have no idea what his function was at this establishment..Not sure if he was a bouncer or part of management..He stated that my party including myself had to leave the premise because they didn't allow shorts after 1130pm..I tried to explain that we were clearly inside the restaurant before that time and that I had just spent a good amount of money at dinner..He stated he didnt care..I asked for a manager and he literally told me I had to leave the restaurant and THEN the manager would come outside!!! When I refused to leave until I spoke with someone of authority he proceeded to now get in my face and tell me \" You either leave the good way or the bad way!! OK now I really wasn't leaving until i spoke with the manager!!!! He went outside and got the Police officer who was stationed out front...Out of respect to the officer i went outside and waited till manager came out...I explained that we were not aware of this NO SHORTS rule..It was not posted anywhere..And we just spent a good amount of money in their restautant!!! He said sorry but we couldn't stay..I watched as they literally went table by table and asked people to pay their bills and leave because they also had on shorts!!!!!!Unproffesional all around!! Will never visit this place again..",

The restaurant was fully booked with large parties however, the hosted was extremely helpful and accommodated us knowing that the other parties may have to wait.  We were so grateful.  Her understanding and customer service is a reason I will continue to visit this restaurant and recommend them to others. In addition, we had a fantastic meal, met the most adorable waitress who came from Cuba and has only been in this country for 1 year.  All in all, the experience was fantastic as well as the food.",
