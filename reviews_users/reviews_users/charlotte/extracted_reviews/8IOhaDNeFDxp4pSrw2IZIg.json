    "text": "Have been a regular family patron for years.  Friday night, Jan. 2, 2015, went there and was treated so poorly by owners we will never return.  All we wanted was the hot wings for 11 year old he has enjoyed for over a year.  Because he wasn't very hungry we got the kid portion not knowing this place has some \"policy\" over no hot sauce for kid meal.  We asked to have them redone and male owner was RUDE about it.  Refused to listen or for me to explain he eats hot wings every Friday night.  He should know his regular customers.  Female owner came over and was full of excuses and whiny.    All we wanted was the wings to be served as we ordered them.  Why are we arguing about a chicken wing?  Don't punish your regular paying patrons for someone else's doing.  This used to be a regular place for our family.  I was embarrassed by how we were treated in front of 4 kids.  This place has been changing from a family atmosphere to a loud, pop music, with young, snotty wait staff for some time.  With owners as the example they proved to be I can see why the wait staff has no guidance.  Would not recommend this place for families or if your kid has a taste for anything off the kid menu.  We would have ordered the adult meal as usual had we known this was going to be so difficult.  Did not appreciate the attitude from owner and will not return.",

My son built a beautiful salad, I had the taco salad and of course a side of fries. Next week we're trying burger's and fish fry! Wish we had this place instead of Hickory Tavern in Sun Valley. 4 out of 5 cause it's not big enough. But, worth the 30 minute wait on a Friday night",

He never finishes burgers when we go out, but he sat and forced himself to finish his burger because he said it was too good not to! Build your own burgers (and turkey burgers), and the prices are FAR FROM over priced and there is more than enough food and you will not be left hungry.

The fries had great texture & flavor. My wife had the build your own burger that offers a ton of topping selections. She had the side of sweet potato tots. I wasn't a big fan of the tots. Kinda tasted like the frozen kind. Nice little craft beer selection on tap too and with great prices ($4.50 for a pint). I got the OMB Dunkel. Shout out to Jules for the great service!!",

My wife got the Reuben, which was just ok, I got the jambalaya which had a weird taste and wasn't worth the $13 I paid for it. We ordered the fried pickles which was advertised as \"1/2 pound\" which was a whole lie. We had maybe 15 small fried pickles for $7.25. The atmosphere was absolute chaos. We spent almost $40 for a dinner for 2, and were very disappointed. If you want to find a place where the food and service is \"Dunwell\" don't let the name fool you, go somewhere else.",

The sweet potato tots saved his meal though! Overall good service. We'll be back. As mentioned in other posts, 4 stars relative to mint hill but solid 3.5 in the grand scheme.",

It was actually quite loud in there and you can get the whole sports/bar/grill vibe they are  going for.  Nonetheless we were seated right away and opted for the outdoor patio.  This was nice and casual and simple..exactly what we were looking for.  We started with their homemade chips and salsa.  The salsa was very fresh, we practically drank it!  We enjoyed it.  IT had somewhat of a beer flavor but when we asked if it had beer in it we were told no.  Maybe the chef was drinking on the job and accidentally dripped a little in our batch.  Regardless, it was very good and we had no problem woofing it down.  I went with the turkey burger and the husband got a regular burger.  Mine came with a sauce of choice and avocado, some other yummy stuff and on a gluten free bun.  All of the patties are made in house so that is good (except the veggie burger is frozen).  The sauces were somewhat  generic but not bad.  The sweet potato tots were everything they needed to be...greasy, sweet and more of a dessert than anything else!  They were quite good.    They weren't the best burgers we have had but again, there isn't much to compare it to in this area.  So in that regard Dunwellz stands out!  They offer specials throughout the week/weekend, music and other fun themes.  They have a fun, relaxed atmosphere so definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.",

Afterwards everyone's check was brought out, she said mine was the only one she didn't have a pen for. Not that it's a big deal but I don't feel like I was treated with priority, although I was spending the same money as the others. You pay for a service and expect to get treated with respect, as customers we don't owe restaurants anything, be grateful of our patronage. You're employed because of our support.

In Mint Hill, it is definitely 4 stars, especially considering the alternatives (or the fact that there aren't really alternatives).   While it is far from a taproom, Dunwellz has a decent selection of beers on tap and in cans and bottles. They have regular drink specials as well. Sometimes you just want a simple beer from OMB, and Dunwellz delivers that.   The food is pretty good. I'm a big fan of the sweet potato tots with the crack/cinnamon sugar butter dipping sauce. The sandwiches are good but not great. If you're looking for decent pub food, you'll find it here.   I never seek out Dunwellz, but I'll come here now and then when I am sick of other local options.

I had the meatloaf burger, which was incredible.  My oldest son had a burger which he said, and I quote: \"almost brought him to tears\".  My youngest had the BBQ wings, which he loved.  Great service too.  We were there after 1:00 on a Saturday and it was still crowded but food came out fast and hot.  This will likely be our new go-to joint.  Can't recommend enough.  Plus, they're locally owned, which is a bonus.  This part of Charlotte has too many crappy chains or unremarkable local places.  This place has verve and great unpretentious eats.",

    "text": "Sometimes, the value of a restaurant is significantly influenced by its surroundings. A good place can be less desirable if it's hard to get there. Conversely, a mediocre place can be great if it's convenient. Dunwellz falls into the latter category.  Dunwellz is fairly middle-of-the-road in both food and decor. The food is decent. It's not amazing: fairly typical bar quality, but it's not bad, either. My chicken quesadilla was filling and not dried out, but it was slightly on the bland side. The same could be said for P's burger. The menu is divided into appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on, and you get to \"build your own\" within each section. That's where the custom part comes in.   Nevertheless, Dunwellz is A-OK in my book, and the reason for that is they're open till 11:00 during the week. That makes them one of the few late-ish night options in Mint Hill. And for that, I say hooray.",

Their beer batter fries are good as well.  My son had a quesadilla, straight out napoleon dynamite. His tortilla shell was crispy, as it should be, because it was cooked ib the griddle.

    "text": "Saturday night at 8pm I scored myself a HUGE burger, built to my preference with a side for only $7.50 which is their speciality every Saturday after 7pm - I got it to-go so I can't comment on the service but I built my burger with Bacon, Mozzarella, guacamole, lettuce, onion and pickles! Pub chips with ranch were not fried properly, a lot of the chips were over cooked and extremely oily. So they tasted like burnt oil and the burger was also COVERED in grease.. it must of been from the bacon or melted cheese? But it was almost soggy when I unwrapped it to eat and the drive was only 8 minutes home from the restaurant. After dabbing up the grease on the burger bun which required 3 napkins total  the flavor was great and the burger was cooked and built to exactly my request! It was a thick, juicy patty with a lot of flavor and I would definitely try this place again, especially if I'm in the area on a Saturday night. Hopefully the greasy-grease overload was just a fluke and it's not always like that",

Also highly recommend the sweet potato tots with this amazing honey cinnamon butter they serve on the side.

The chicken tenders were your general run of the mill tenders, the Korean barbecue tacos tasted like unseasoned London broil that was chewy and not able to be consumed in a single bite. The fries were pretty good and well seasoned. We got a side of ranch that had lumps all throughout. It was questionable if the ranch was bad as it had an odd aftertaste.   Service was good.",

We ordered the fried pickles for appetizers which my kids liked so that's a plus! My husband liked the dressing more than the fried pickle. He also thought the sweet tea was perfect cause it didn't taste like full on sugar load.  I ordered the salmon street tacos and I actually enjoyed the flavor of it. Sweet potato tots were my side dish and it came with a sweet butter sauce. I was actually fine without it cause the tots tasted sweet already. But I wasn't able to finish my second taco cause I thought it was plenty!  Our server was attentive and sweet. I appreciate when you don't have to request for extra refills and they are aware to provide without calling on them.   Not sure I'll be rushing back soon but definitely will visit again to try their other items on their menu.",

They changed the menu since my last review added new things got rid of others, I do miss the chicken penne as it was one of my favorites. The build your own burger is always a great option as well as the salads, and there mac and cheese is tasty. My only one wish is it wasn't so loud it's so hard to talk to others at your table and I feel like I always have to ask the waitress to repeat what she said. The service is great everyone is really friendly and on the ball. This restaurant is one of the best around!",

We ordered potato skins app, me a burger and Mac and cheese, home fish tacos and pub chips. Our app: three potato skins. And they were rotten. After I was thoroughly horrified, and out server had disappeared, we finally found someone to take them away. When our meals came out, my man and cheese was ice cold. We had to flag down our server. When I said this is cold \"Oh, did you want it warm?\" Seriously? Then I checked my burger. Now I have food allergies and when I order I'm specific as to what to not put on my burger. It was on there, and had been scraped off, and had I eaten it, I could have ended up in the hospital. So I never got to eat. My boyfriend was so mad, because he wanted to celebrate my new job/career, not have me use an epi pen.  In the midst of this, a manager with stink face brought my macaroni, said they had warmed it. No thank you. Never again. How about you focus on service instead of trying to be the cool bar. It's obviously not working for you.",

Everything we have had here has been great. Generally we start with the spicy fried pickles. Then we have the make your own burger (we choose black bean). My favorite though is the shrimp tacos blackened. The wasabi dressing is amazing. We love the pub chips and the sweet potato tots which comes with a cinnamon butter. Yes those are to die for. They always have the local brews to drink which is always a reason we come.  My friend and I have come for karaoke before. That's been highly entertaining!",

    "text": "This was hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I have been to Dunwellz a number of times before and had a decent experience, but after today, I'm never coming back. Here's why...  My friends and I went here for lunch. At first things were going well. The waitress came right to our table and was very accommodating. Then about 15 minutes in, we started noticing some of the waitresses staring at us and talking. We thought that was a bit weird, but then things got weirder. Many of us had finished our drinks, and our waitress wasn't coming to our table to refill them. We could see her looking at us, but she wouldn't come to our table. Then the manager brought our food out, and he seemed a bit miffed at us. Every one of us at the table were racking our brains trying to figure out what we did to cause everyone to act so offended. I finally got up from the table and brought my empty drink glass to our waitress to ask her to refill my drink and the drinks of my friends at the table. She refilled my drink, but would not bring it back to our table. Another waitress did. A few minutes later, I took another empty glass from our table and asked a different waitress for a refill. She refilled the drink, and our waitress handed me the checks to bring back to our table. Then she realized she had forgotten a couple of our checks and came over to our table for the first time in half an hour to bring those two checks. One of us asked her what was going on, and our waitress told us the hostess had overheard one of us say our waitress was a little b***h. Of course, none of us had said anything even close to that. The hostess was lying. But because our waitress believed the hostess, we were treated like trash. It was also clear that the manager also believed the lie that was told about us. So if you like going to restaurants where employees won't lie about you, save yourself the trouble and don't go to Dunwellz.",

My wife and I both ordered tacos. The braised beef, although a bit salty, was tender and tasty and was served with sour cream. The side salad was fresh and loaded with good stuff.  The shrimp tacos came piled high with medium sized shrimp and a delicious wasabi sauce. The sweet potato tater tots with cinnamon butter were addictive. Overall bill was about $29 without tip.  Rounding things out, the atmosphere was casual and the sanitation score was an impressive 97.5. Would consider returning if in the area. If Yelp allowed, I'd rate it closer to a 3.5 than a 3.",

They reserved a table for us and let us drop a cake off early!  I ventured out and tried the sweet potato and black bean burger in a wrap.  It was AHHHHMAZING.  My husband got wings, which are always on point, my mom and dad order the chicken sandwich on Texas toast (huge portion), my sister got the buffalo sandwich, and my sisters fiance got the chicken tenders.  The food was brought out promptly and everyone devoured it quickly.  You can create your own salad or sandwich which is a nice menu addition as well!

Have a nice menu with a variety of options, great daily drink specials, friendly servers, and more. This place really hits all spots. If there is any negative, it's that it's a popular place, and if you get there later in the evening you're probably going to wait for a table. My family can't wait to return.",

You'll find they have pretty good tacos great hamburgers love the crispy fries in the condiments.

After 5 minutes one girl looks up and ask how many proceeds to tell us it is a 25 minute wait then takes off and didn't return for a bit. She didn't write us down. Another girl asked us how many then wrote us down. They kept seating tables of 2 instead of pushing two tables together at that point we had been waiting 25 minutes. We waited another 25 minutes and decided to leave. After cancelling our table two members of our party was still in the building talking to family members that are regulars there to over hear the waitstaff get told the 8 top decided to leave and the others to excitedly say thank goodness, i'm glad....hmmm I will never step foot in that door again.

Me and my little girl enjoyed the carmel sauce that came with the apples she got with her meal it was very good.  My mom enjoyed her salad, I got the hamburger on texas toast with fries and some fried pickles.  I wasn't expecting the pickles to hot but they were, and that made me really upset. Any who, the burger well it was just ok nothing to shout about or be excited.  It was so good that the other half of it is still sitting in my refridgerator.   I hate that it wasn't that good because there aren't too many places to eat at around here.  I think that maybe I just ordered the wrong food, not sure if I will give it another try or not.",

We normally eat wings at The Hill Grill,which are great wings, but the way Dunwellz prepares theirs were more of our taste, slighty smaller wing which fries up better and gives it a great taste.Lots of sauce selections, and the prices are more reasonable than any other place in the area.The onion rings were also good. Great drinks. Will definitely be going back to try one of the build your own burgers. They have great food and drink specials daily.",

    "text": "We have tried this new, locally owned place 3 times now. The first time was shortly after they opened ,so we will excuse the bumps in the service-which was lack of service. We actually had to flag wait person down to ask to get service. Meanwhile the person I take to be the owner is standing at the end of the row of tables talking to friends. Finally order the food and are served. No problem with the food at all. Very tasty burgers & fries. Onion rings kind of weak.  Second trip everything is fine, good service, good food. The one problem was the delay in the charge card - husband put the tip on the card, but noticed the next morning when he checked his bank statement on line it didn't show the tip. Not wanting the server to think we didn't tip her, he went up later that day and gave her the tip. Of course, the next day the separate charge for the tip comes through. Oh well. Last night was the 3rd visit. Greeted at the door by 2 hostesses & taken to our table. And then we wait. And wait. And wait. We can count 8 servers millling around. We finally ask the hostess to send a waitress over. Once again food is fine. Interesting note is the owner actually came by the table to pick up an empty plate- never said a word to us. For a local place, I really would think speaking to your guests would go a long way in getting them to return. Training someone to be in charge of the floor and take notice of what's going on would help as well.  Would we return? Not really sure- there's a lot of good burger places out there that have good food, good service and really appreciate the fact that you choose to support their business.",

You just don't want to walk in expecting anything more than a local hangout that has staple bar food.  Do that and you too will like it.",

Not to mention, you've got very few options out here so I would've thought this place to be pretty popular.   Beer, Food, Games, Patio, Clean...  *scratches head*  Oh Well, It was a good find for me while staying close by so call me a Fan!  I ordered the Fish and Chips that were pretty dang good The fish meat was super tender white and juicy, the crust had a nice thin layer of crisp bread and the server knew that the dish goes well with Malt Vinegar.  While I can't vouch for all their food my fish and chips were grade A.  Peace.",

It's a shame they are so unprofessional, becacuse the food is actually good. They clearly don't care if they have customers or make money. The place is always only a third to a half full, but they can't actually serve the people trying to eat there.  EDIT: 1/16/13: We gave this place another try, and it was much better the second time.

On a Tuesday evening, they were packed (again, minimal choices locally). Luckily it was a nice evening, since the patio were their only seats. It is secluded, away from the parking lot and other traffic. There are a couple corn-hole sets to go with their picnic table seats. The hostess and server were very nice.  The food is OK. It wasn't abysmal, but I'm not counting down the days to go back, either. Typical bar food, though I was expecting everything to be a dollar or two less than it is.   They have a small, but decent, beer list as well as a few wines and mixed drinks.   They'll be a great option in the area when I want to go out for a beer but don't want to drive to University or South End.",

    "text": "My wife and I along w/ my 2 little boys recently went to Dunwellz.  As we entered the restaurant the hostess told us we can sit anywhere. So being that we have two little ones and don't want to disturb others we took a corner table in the back.  The 1st issue was we waited over 10 minutes just for someone to take our drink order.  Not for beer or soda, just to get water.  As the waitress approached our table she appeared that she was not happy to see us sitting in her section as she rolled her eyes and gave us the \"look\".  Once the waitress took our order, she was back in about 5 minutes w/ our drinks which is OK since the restaurant was starting to fill up around 1pm.  We placed our order (wife ordered Mushroom Swiss Burger & I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich).  My wife however asked that instead of Swiss Cheese they add American cheese.  Pretty simple request I thought.  20 minutes later food came.  We were starving and ready to enjoy our lunch and of course my wife's' burger had Swiss cheese instead of American.  Now, if this was the 1st time, honest mistake, I can accept that, but this was the 2nd time the kitchen made my wife's burger incorrect.  We had been there a couple of weeks earlier ordering the same things.  So, both waitresses both times confirmed they keyed American cheese into the POS and they confirmed it with the receipt so shame on the kitchen staff for not getting this right.  So the waitress took the burger back and then within a minute the burger came back w/ American cheese, but you could clearly see that all they did was scrap off the swiss (which by the way there was still little bit on there) and then they placed a cold piece of american cheese on the burger.  So my wife now had to eat a semi warm burger that has been handled multiple times w/ a cold piece of american cheese, gross!   The other thing that was very annoying is our waitress was not attentive at all and I had to flag her down at least 4-5 times for another beer, clean up and the check. The waitresses were huddled together by the soda machine checking their cell phones and talking.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, I enjoy the vast selection of craft beers, but if I was a new comer and had this experience I would assume Dunwellz wait staff and kitchen staff pays no attention to detail and also doesn't wait to pay attention to families w/ little kids.",

On the downside, all of the beers were very, very safe choices and nothing that stood out.  Ordered a burger and got chips instead of fries.  Chips were OK but I did wonder how old the oil was.  Burger was on the VERY RARE side of \"Medium Rare\", I just know some of the times I have requested medium at other establishments it gets cooked all the way through.  This one was still mooing but it was tasty all the same.  I forgot my wallet, but thankfully have memorized a credit card number - not sure how that would have worked out...I'd probably still be there washing dishes! I will give a different dish a try next time, hopefully they will work on improving their beer selection.",

The \" regulars \" are normally out there partaking in shots and smoking cigarettes while engaging in deep, philosophical discussions that include numerous variants of The ' F ' word. Went there recently on a Sunday ( their advertised \" Sunday Kids Day \" ) and the regulars were out there while at least two other families were out on the patio with children and had to hear the filthy language. I mentioned this to one of the wait staff and finally said something to one of the gentlemen but my wife told me to not start any trouble. Seems to me that whomever is bartending at the time should have cut them off after about their 4th shot.",

The brisket grilled cheese sandwich is fantastic and on nights they have the tomato basil soup is a perfect combo.  The family loves the wings or Queso for an appetizer.

I can't comment on the beer selections, we don't drink, but my Diet Coke was very refreshing. We went because I heard from a friend that they had a diverse menu, which they do.   We started with a yummy southwest egg roll app served with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce. A little too spicy for my 14 year old, but Alina and I enjoyed them. Alex ordered the make your  own burger, which she said was very tasty. She also had a side of baked potato soup, which she liked even more than her burger. Alina ordered the make your own fish sandwich, which was way too big for her to finish. Alina really liked the potato bun, it went great with the crunchy fish filet. I ordered the 1/2 lb chicken tenders app as my meal. I asked for a side of bbq sauce, and guess what? It arrived with the meal, I didn't have to send the server back to get it. The tenders were small, but abundant. I'm a big guy, but I couldn't finish the fries. Oh, I finished the tenders, no worries there. I was very happy with my menu choice, it was great.  If I had to find 1 con, it was that lunch for 3 with only 2 sodas came to $41, a little pricey for lunch. If we are ever back in Mint Hill, we will definitely return for another great meal.",

    "text": "I decided to stop in for lunch and check out this place to see what it was all about. The rumor was that it was going to be a type of build your burger joint and for once the rumors were pretty spot on. While the food itself is kinda what I would call on the level with \"bar food\" (ie burgers, wings, etc) it is all very well prepared. There wasn't one hiccup in either my order or the food itself which it seems like a lot of times when you try new places they usually tend to mess something up. Not the case here which imo goes to show they know what they are doing.   For lunch I had some chips and queso for a app and the queso was kind of standard but the chips themselves were more of a high quality restaurant style which were served piping hot and tasted awesome. I followed that up with a Turkey burger and some sweet potato tots. The patty on the turkey burger was seasoned extremely well and tasted delicious. The sweet potato tots were top notch and served with a honey cinnamon dip that complemented them very well. The one thing that I gotta say that was cool about the burgers is that they let you choose multiple toppings and don't nickle and dime you to death on the price for each additional item. I think it's like 50 cents extra for chili but all the standard stuff is gratis which is awesome.   The only one down side I can say about the place is that they had country music as a static background. It fits the place well but seeing how I personally hate country music I just had to suffer through it with the meal but that didn't detract from the excellent service or food at all.",

    "text": "I've been coming to dunwellz for years since I've worked in the same shopping center. It was the local hang out spot for me and my friends and co workers to hang out after work. However, we have stopped coming here as much and every time we do we decide to probably not to come back again bc THEIR SERVICE SUCKS!!!! waitresses are rude and slow whether they are busy or slow. Can't even bring me the water I ordered. The bartenders only focus on regulars at the bar, and distant themselves from other at tables. It's very apparent that they are solely focused on guaranteed tips instead of helping others, and it's absolutely terrible. I stood at the bar not waiting for a drink, but waiting to even get asked if I've been helped or would I like to order, ALL THREE bartenders passed me by for over 15 minutes even when I tried getting their attention to order and I still got nothing. So I said oh well and left. I ended up getting drinks from the gas station and went home. This is how local places like this lose business and eventually close down. I don't think I'm gonna come back at all, and I'm gonna tell all my customers that come to my store in the same shopping center not to either!",
