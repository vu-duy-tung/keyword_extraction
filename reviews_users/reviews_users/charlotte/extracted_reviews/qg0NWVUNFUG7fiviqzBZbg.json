If you come in here expecting a Bad Daddy's kind of burger and atmosphere, you'll be disappointed.  Our server was Katie, she was training another girl - I can't remember her name. But Katie was very friendly and helpful. Every time we asked for something she went running off to get it. I got the bacon cheese burger, with bottomless fries. The fries are very good (apparently, they sell them in stores?) When I finished my first little cup of fries I wanted a handful more - but not too many. I tried to explain this to Katie, like \"portion controlled bottomless\" haha. She asked for me to give her a number, like how many fries... \"Seven.\" And that's exactly what she came back with! *see photo* It was a perfect \"portion controlled bottomless fries\" interaction. We all enjoyed our food, and Emileigh (6yr old) was given crayons and paper to keep her busy. So this is a nice! family friendly place.  I wasn't super impressed, but it's good for a quick and low priced burger. I'll come back, but I probably won't crave it.",

I had the burger with an egg on top ( forgot the name) and I thought it was so good! My Boyfriend had a bacon cheeseburger. We both left full and satisfied. If you're looking for a cheap bite I would recommend heading this way.",

I met my friend/broker here for a mid lunch before the closing of my home. It was slow because of it being after the lunch rush. We sat at the bar. Usually service at the bar is great but not this time. It was slow and long. We also didn't have everything we needed when our food came. I.E. Silverware and condiments. And my friend was missing an item off his plate. We managed to get out of there in time to be 5 minutes late for the closing. While the food is good, the service can improve.",

    "text": "3 PM on a sweltering hot day.  When I lived in Connecticut (4 years ago), there was a Red Robin in the Boston Post mall.   The motif was a 50s diner and similar menu.  Relatively cheap burgers.  That's what I was expecting as I walked toward the door.    What I found was a fairly upscale bar that happens to serve institutional food.  I ordered the \"Arctic Cod\" fish and chips with the Orange cream Soda.  The cod were overcooked and tasteless - closer to fish sticks.  The plastic container basket seemed designed to cool food as quickly as possible and awkward to use.  I neither asked for more steak fries or a refill  The music playing was annoying, along with the sports on the TV.  Most people would probably consider that a plus.  The waiter explained to me that the chain in CT was a different company.  That's not True.  They reimagined themselves to not tcompete against Steak & Shake or 5 guys, which was what I was hoping to find",

Overall, the experience was above average and I would definitely recommend going to this Red Robins and enjoy the food.",

Hardly anyone in the restaurant. We sat and weighted for 15 minutes... literally 15 minutes. No one ever came to our table, so we got up and left. My wife said something to the manager as we were leaving. She tried to give us a coupon for a free meal, we didn't take it though.   Came back 1 time since then. Similar situation. Our waiter came and took our drinks, didn't come back with them for 10 or 15 minutes. We sat and watched him chatting with the cooks just messing around.  A shame cause I love Red Robins food, and this location used to be good years ago, but it sucks now. Terrible customer service.",

Dipping sauces not so much but they don't need any help. And remember to save one of those rings for your burger.   Ordered my S&P medium with crisp bacon which was grilled to perfection! I added that remaining ring for additional crunch...delicious!  The fries are similar to the ring dipping sauce...forgettable! Surprising considering they're target market is the burger segment.

Bottomless fries is pointless if you can't get a servers attention to get more. Place has gone down hill from our last experience.",

I decided to order the Whiskey BBQ burger which had aWhiskey BBQ sauce, onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese. It came with bottomless steak fries which were also perfectly seasoned and hot. This is a huge burger, but it hit the spot! I pared it with a traditional margarita on the rocks with salt since it was Margarita Day! I loved the decor and the collage of pictures above our heads. The oversized Lego burger and milkshake were really neat too. They have trivia to play at your tables but you pay for the games. What I loved was you could order food, call your server and also pay for your check on the same trivia machine! This helped keep things moving and also quick to check out.",

After about 15 minutes, my waiter showed up and finally took my order. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger and ordered a beer along with it. It took so long for the food to come out that I had already downed my first beer (the 22 oz I might add) before the burger even arrived. I typically enjoy eating my burgers with a beer, so I ordered a second beer. After waiting about 20 minutes and watching my food grow cold, I decided I couldn't wait any longer. I had only a couple of bites left before the waiter finally showed up with my second beer. The burger tasted pretty good overall, and the garlic Parmesan fries I had with it were surprisingly addictive. Had it not been for the poor service, I would have given my evening 4, possibly 5 stars. However the poor service makes me wish I tried another burger joint in the area instead.",

Hostess went to get a napkin, a regular table napkin, and wiped off the table- shoving the crumbs to the floor.  I told her I would prefer it actually be cleaned and would wait. Menu still in hand she got a wet rag, wiped it off and sat me at the soaking table. I asked her to dry it.  She then asked and commented on why I was dining alone... I placed my order and then ordered a wedge salad on the table top menu ziosk. No salad eve came. Around 15-20 minutes later my burger appeared and the waitress said the salad was coming. I canceled the mini wedge as that was an appetizer.   Someone came to apologize but stated the kitchen never received the order. If they hadn't how would the waitress know to say it was coming...    This was a reward burger but has taken way longer. McDonald's wouldve been better.   On a good note burger was ok. Nothing special but it was a reward burger.  After all that charged me for the salad, had to get it removed... asked to leave a tip via card, they heard me wrong. Poor waitress I wish I had cash but after all that atleast she got something.",

My husband ordered the whiskey river bbq burger and he took one bite and had to stop eating right away. He bit into the burger and he tasted a chunk of salt on his burger. The burger was not seasoned evenly. He barely had a bite of his burger. The manager did come and try to have him order something else. Although, the burger left such a bad taste in his mouth that he didn't want to try anything else. Overall, the food was just okay. Hopefully  they start taking their time and seasoning the burgers correctly.",

I ordered the clam chowder soup as an appetizer. This took forever to come and when it finally came, it was about 3 minutes before the food came. Then the soup was running like a river. I was upset about that and then it was a river soup. The orders were all messed up. We ordered black beans and they bought out fries. My son ordered grilled chicken and oranges and they bought him grill cheese and fries. I guess the waitress was ordering our food for us tonight. Once that was corrected and the manager came over you would think things would have gotten better... auuuh NOT!! They forgot the black beans and when it finally came out.. it was cold. Now what in the world. Really... how are black beans cold. That makes no sense at all. That basically told us the pot was not on at all. Then the manager visited our table again. Soo when it was all said and done the manager treated us to nice deserts. Since the meals were all jacked up from the beginning to the end. We had the mud pie which was good ice cream for days and I had the brownie which was delicious. We may return but not sure if it will be this year. They were just completely off tonight. We have visited this location several times. We were very disappointed in the service tonight. Maybe time will change something's... next year.",

The rude hostess arrived and Didn't even greet us.  I said table for two and she reluctantly searched for menus.  She dragged herself I to the bar and set the menus on a four person high top.  Still never saying a word to us.  We don't like eating in the bar, especially when there are plenty of tables available, and we really don't like hightops.  We left and ended up at Big Daddy's.",

We ordered mozzarella sticks because my child wanted some. Needless to say they never came. The waitress we had never came by to check on us and the manager became our server and actually apologized. Our original waitress never came by to apologize. This is the third time we have had problems at this location. I will never be coming back because of all these problems. Get better staff who actually care about their customers.",

And another 15 minutes to get our drinks. The place wasn't super busy and we were seated near the kitchen and whenever I looked our server was standing by the food pick up just waiting looking around. He didn't once check in on us to see how everything was, when we needed something we had to flag him down. My chicken sandwich was slightly undercooked, and I had to tell him I wasn't going to pay for something that I didn't even get to enjoy. The only good thing I can say is the onion rings are amazing. I'm glad a person I was with shared his appetizer with me or else I would have gone hungry. We had empty water cups for the majority of our meal, he didn't once come with any refills on the waters. Which is something super easy and noticeable for a server. Probably will never be back to a Red Robin again. Can't ever get good service. Maybe the managers should put an emphasis on customer service and their servers will probably make more money in tips. The awful customer service makes the entire dining experience a lot less enjoyable.",

Always seems completely understaffed. My last and final visit I ordered Togo. I stood at the front for ten min before anyone even came up. The entire lobby was packed full of confused guests. The dining room floor did not seem busy whatsoever. Finally a young man came up and took my name. He was very friendly and helpful but the look on his face read overwhelmed. They have the poor guy seating people and doing Togo. It was insufficient. In total I was in Red Robin's lobby 38 minutes. For Togo food. Needless to say when I got home my salad was wilted having been packed with once warm food. My family's food was cold. Fries soggy. Altogether nasty. Red Robin needs to focus more on customer service and properly staffing the restaurant. I honestly can't believe this location is still open.",

I felt the restaurant was dirty. There was crap all over the floor under tables. The tables themselves were also not that clean and were getting bussed extremely slow (if at all). I ordered multiple items and was told they didn't have them because \"the menu changes daily\". I ordered a Heineken (didn't have it), then a Miller Lite (didn't have it), then fried pickles appetizer (didn't have it). The sign for \"Today's Beers\" was blank (super helpful). The bathrooms were also gross with no paper towels. There was a puddle of either urine or water under the urinal. We made a complaint to the manager who did nothing but look at us with a piercing stare as we described our poor experience. She then claimed half of the staff was at a co-worker's wedding and she was left with the \"C crew\". Management here needs a swift kick in the pants.",

    "text": "Since we were out of town and I haven't tried Red Robin, ever (believe it!), we went to this location to check out their food.  They have remodeled the place, which is huge, and fun environment. They have an upgraded menu, more modern, but this isn't a place for you if you want healthy food or if you're a vegetarian. It took us a while to find burgers without bacon added on them. I got one of their \"finest\", the DGB with oven roasted tomatoes, arugula, olive oil dressing on ciabatta. It was pretty good, more interesting. My husband wasn't too impressed with his Whiskey River BBQ, kinda bland, he wanted his cooked well done and it was more rare than he wanted. I wanted regular fries and our waiter assumed I ordered sweet potato fries, which I don't like (and didn't order) and that's what he brought me. Since they have their endless basket of fries, I got regular ones soon. The basket is pretty small and I don't eat a lot of fries. I can't say I was impressed with them.  The beer selection is poor, I couldn't get anything better on the tap besides Sam Adams. Just your regular Buds, etc, nothing special. I'm a beer aficionado, so this place's selection didn't make the cut for me.  They have some gadgets on the table if you need to call your waiter. That didn't work. Service wasn't great, the beers came late, just before they brought our food.  They have loyalty cards if you go to this place a lot, better get one to enjoy some perks, coupons, etc. They give you a free burger when the local football team wins, so look into that for details. I don't live in the area, so I don't have the scoop on it.  I care about my girlish figure, so this visit is just a rare occasion for me at Red Robin, not a habit.",

Red Robin has lost it's way.  In Charlotte there are 3 and none of them are up to par. The one we went to last night is a train wreck. Even after getting the manager to come out. She was busy in the back doing inventory while her staff was busy watching the game on TV. There were at least a dozen dirty tables in the middle of the restaurant. All of them had trash under them and were in no state to be used by anyone. There was a piece of paper from a straw next to our table that just about every server stepped on but never picked up. Even after I made eye contact and looked at the paper they server still stepped over it. They were very busy breaking down the bar area and cleaning the things they could vs. taking care of the actual customers who were there. Only about a dozen customers in the store at the time and no one was getting taken care of.  After getting the manager to come out she offered nothing to make up for the situation. You all need help in NC. All of the Red Robin's here are crap and the only reason we were there was because I had a gift card. I will not be giving you my money for a long time. You also might want to fix that menu. It's a freaking train wreck too. Way too long and way too complicated. There is no flavor to anything either. It's just boring.",

It's been nearly a month since our visit and it's taken me this long to be able to write a constructive review that wouldn't be doused in anger toward them.   We showed up at a party of 10... 8 adults and 2 small children. We were seated and greeted by our waitress who immediately seemed miserable. She didn't even try to be friendly. We started the visit off with most of us receiving the wrong beverage. Once that was worked out, we placed our orders. The kids both got cheese pizzas, and the adults ordered various burgers and chicken tenders. We waiting an obnoxiously long time for our food, although the restaurant wasn't busy. That's aside, once the food arrived, the runner started auctioning off our food by holding in front my brother's face and shouting \"Who had...\" and aggressively enough that my brother had to duck and pull away from his seat. His face implied he was just as confused by the runners lack of self awareness as the rest of us were.   Then the manager (Shaun, who I believe is the General Manager) arrived with two pizzas for the kids. Both had been made with pepperoni. Now anyone who has been to dinner with small children knows that if a kid ordered and wants CHEESE pizza, then pepperoni ain't gonna cut it. They wont touch it. But when we brought to the managers that it was suppose to be cheese pizza, he replied with frustration and asked if could \"just pick off the pepperoni\" and then became even more annoyed when we said no.   After that whole debacle, the kids got their cheese pizzas and everyone was eating except me. My food never arrived. And though I had brought this to the attention of BOTH managers who visited the table, nearly everyone was finished eating before Shaun finally returned to tell me that my food was never rang in and that it would be out shortly. I kindly asked him to bag it up to-go since everyone else was nearly finished eating.   I must note that after our order was taken, we never saw our server until we were ready to pay. The only people at our table in between those times were two very incompetent managers. We needed extra napkins, refills on our drinks, and many other things throughout the evening and no one offered to get them or even responded when we asked for them.   To boot, once I told the manager I would not be paying for my burger (because why would I at this point, honestly?) he became argumentative and told us that our server had low blood sugar and used that as an excuse for our terrible experience. He had about 10 baskets of fries sent to the table even though we were ready to leave, and I think this was a sad and pathetic attempt to please us. He did eventually comp my burger, but we never actually received a sincere apology for our experience, only excuses and poor attitudes from every employee involved.   So, needless to say, we won't return to this location again. And I hope for the sake of that store, Red Robin finds a new managing team because that place is a total shit show.",

COLD SANDWICH TOASTED BUN CRISPY ONIONS on my sandwich COLD FRIES (they looked as if they were someones leftovers, refried) NO KETCHUP  Husbands order...(remember he order a sandwich)... COD PIECES (he said tasted like greasy sponges) NO BUN NO BUN MEANS NO TOPPINGS COLD (STEAK) FRIES (again, his looked as if they were someones leftovers, refried) NO TARTAR  I'd HIGHLY PREFER TO GIVE ZERO STARS but that's not an option!!!",

    "text": "The 2 stars is based solely on the service. A turtle might moved faster. We were traveling and do not have this chain in Charleston and wanted to give it a try. I follow a low calorie, low carb, low fat diet and my options were limited but I was able to find something that was really good. Most options are VERY high calorie and it's a place lurking of heart disease and diabetes. I had a grilled chicken wrapped in lettuce with grilled vegetables and endless broccoli for my side. I could have eaten my weight in the broccoli. My husband had a burger that he said was one of the best he'd ever eaten. What a shame the service was so horrible. We had to wait forever for drink refills and the endless broccoli was somewhat of a joke because the refill on it was a few stalks.",

    "text": "This is the last time I ever go to this Red Robin. We went kind of early, expecting a wait. They told us it would be 30 minutes. It turned out to be 45. No big deal. On the way to our seat we saw the number of un-bused tables. The lobby was full of people waiting to get in and 30% of the tables just sat there. In fact most of those tables went un-bused while people waited. You could tell that the manager of this place just didn't care.  The food took forever to get there and the fries were old. We ordered a refill of the endless fries and never received them. Wait staff were checking their phones in the dining room. Kitchen staff were coming out to check the TV even though the game wasn't starting for 30 minutes. All told we were there for 2 hours and 10 minutes. That is not good when you are there with kids. And it is not good for the restaurant when they need to turn over the tables fast.  Then I had to take my kid to the restroom and it was like we were in a third world country! There was some kind of hair net/dew rag on the floor and both toilets were stopped up.  I should have known when I saw the health rating of 94 that we should have gone elsewhere. Never again there are too many other good burger places in CLT.",

You can never go wrong with bottomless fries, but every so often I TRY to opt for a healthier side option, ya know, like sweet potato fries ... okay, okay.. sometimes a salad, fruit or vegetables occasionally.  They remodeled it towards the 'upscale' side during the latter part of 2015 and it definitely has  a cooler, more 'adultified' feel.  The bar is okay, they have a few draft beer options, but a larger stock of the bottled type.  The fancy modern table-side tablet concept is interesting. Can probably be amazing if you don't like to talk to people - since you can basically order your drinks/meal, play games and pay your bill all on one magical machine. ( I don't mind dealing with a server ... unless they really suck at their job - which is always a dreaded reality of the service industry )  Paying your bill quickly - especially during shortened corporate lunch periods - can be a wonderful thing. Unless you have coupons, then unfortunately that will take a little longer.  YUMMM!",

The waitress removed the charge from our bill; for that matter, the service was friendly and both our waitress and another waitress took care of us.

First our burgers were good however I had to ask the server 3 times for a to go box the fourth time I asked I believe the mgr not sure.  Finally got a box , I had a coupon for a milk shake , that was the worst milk shake Ive ever had , McDonald's makes a better shake an cheaper Do not get a Milk shake. It was milk with some crumbled cookies in it yuck!!!  I also work in Ballantyne an we get the Ballantyne corp discount card an today they said they no longer take it mm odd they've taken it for 5 years.

That being said, I'm not sure if this place is under new management or what is going on bc my visit tonight was definitely a change from what I've experienced here before. They seated us rather quickly, I'll give them that but we had to wait 15 mins for waiter to arrive. ...plus side, this gave us time to decide on an entree. Once ordered, it took another 10-15 mins for the drinks to arrive....in a cup that appeared to have been in the sink, tilted, halfway full of liquid and given time to crust over to indicate so. Food arrived in another 10 mins..which was surprising considering we waited 10-15 mins for water....Guess they needed time to \"wash\" my cup. Son ordered Mac and cheese and speckled fruit. They got the speckled part right but looking at the soup that used to be something else, hard to say if this was fruit. I got the Red Robin gourmet burger.....which pretty much confirmed they use the word gourmet loosely. ...or like a kid that's just beginning to use bigger words but not really sure what they mean. Burger looked nothing like the pic and was burnt. To their credit, the tomatoes were actually solid...I'd say, best part of meal.  My side was bottomless fries but I'm guessing they don't want this to be taken advantage of bc the first order came out showing me the bottom...bottom of the plate that is....pile was less than a small order at McDonald's. They were cooked rather nicely tho. Later, went to wash my son's hands off; usually the options are hot and cold but today, it was just hot and hotter. And lastly, to top the whole dining experience off, we found a massive roach leaving the parking lot.....keeping with their theme of mediocrity, it was just outside, not inside.",

Only downside their onion rings contain dairy and they don't have dairy free mayo. Like other restaurants they serve fructose 'Heinz' ketchup.   Service was very good.

Our server, Ashley, is talking at top volume. I think that she thinks we're hard of hearing . She told the customer behind us that they had 5 people working and there was no reason why the tables weren't bussed. But she told us that they were slammed and couldn't bus the tables, a mystery for sure.  We ordered the guacamole and salsa. Two halves of a tiny bowl for $7.00. I won't be making that mistake again. The bottomless rooter float is still as great as ever. My wife ordered the fried cod and chips like she did the last time we were here.I ordered the Mad Love Burger and kept the birthday burger back for another time.  I don't know why I ordered this burger yet again. I am still probably hoping that it'll taste better one day. Unfortunately today wasn't that day. When RR first came out with it it was very spicy & nice. Now its just a tasteless burger in a long lineup of tasteless burgers. The burger arrived with a thin orange disc protruding from it like a tortilla. We had to ask the server what it was. She said it was a crispy cheese disc. It looked like it had been scraped off the grill. I didn't eat it. The onions had no flavor, nor did the tomatoes. There was some gooey cheese affixed to the bottom of the disc. I scraped it off & ate it. It had some nice flavor. I think it was Swiss cheese. The side salad with ranch dressing was tasty too.  It appears that they have totally redone the interior and eliminated the booths on the far wall of the bar. The wall decorations are different too. Its a shame that the food hasn't gotten better.",

    "text": "So let me just say this started out as a 2 Star because our Server Melissa was very impersonable, semi-rude to my family and myself. She was not helpful at all with our questions. It was like she wanted us to know what and where everything was on that menu. And when we asked a question she hurriedly stated \"It's right there, you passed it\". Never explaining what we wanted to know. Then a family of four seated right across from us and Ms. Melissa was extra \"happy\" and \"excited\" with them offering smiles and suggestions. So we them decided that Yes we were going to speak to her manager.   Well guess who bring us our appetizers??!!! The Manager Debra...and thank God for her because she was amazing. Her smile and welcoming spirit was what my family desired from Melissa. We told Debra how we we felt about our previous Server and asked her was she taking over for her. Well Mellissa came over at that time inquiring about our order but Debra had already handled it and politely let her know. From that point on we were more than happy. See we are a Black Family and the family across from us was Hispanic(don't think Melissa knew the difference) and we didn't want to play the race card but it was obvious to US!!!   Debra was the best. She brought out different fries for us to sample and constantly made sure we were ok. See the thing with customer service is...you never know who is who or who is reviewing the establishment. I am so thankful that Debra(?) came in and handled the situation. And hopefully she spoke with Melissa about her people   skills because whatever someone's ethnic  background..,we are all human.   Went back January 9, 2019 because it's my sons fave place but that will be the last time I patronize this establishment. Fries were COLD, I'm an adult and my Clucks and Shrimp were kids meal size. Server brought out the extra fries(which were also cold) as opposed to coming back and asking did we want more fries. And never asked about a refill  On our drinks. Wait I forgot to state that we waited 5 minutes to be seated because no one was at the front. I had to go to the cooking area and ask \"do we seat ourselves?\" So that's it!!!!",

    "text": "Sunday and Saturday left much to be desired.  Both days were to-go orders. This was my cheap alternative to cronuts and they had freebies all week. Each day was something different.   I emailed the mgmt about the missing drink on Saturday.  Returned Sunday and the BLTA + cup of chowder, ordered online missed the mark on No tomatoes, no mayo. The Chowder wasn't even a full ladle. Guy working apologized and worked hard to correct everything.   Walked off without my chowder because they said - everything is ready. But at least they chased me down in the lot to give me the chowder. They corrected it by giving me watered down soup Clam chowder. I'm like everyone knows chowder should be thicker. Alas, the BLTA came back with no tomato no mayo yet barely had any avocado and I was over it.   The wings were tepid and 2 were just ice box cold.  Y'all.. I don't know if they have a whole new kitchen, some steady employees were gone for the weekend but I do know I can only recommend getting the cronuts to go. See, I'm holding out hope dine in is just better. Either way, even the Speckled Lemon was bitter and tasted like powder mix. Yuck",

How do you have several dirty tables and hardly any customers?  The quality of food has declined. My all time go to burger, A1 Peppercorn is just not good anymore. It's sad, I really enjoyed this place. My last 3 visits in 2 years has been the same. Poor service, poor food and poor cleanliness. I am officially done with Red Robin.

Was seated in the bar and judging from the dirty dishes on table tops and backed up around the bar not sure I want to see the kitchen??  Ordered a Chophouse Burger as pink/red as possible but apparently they had no pink left in the kitchen as it was DONE!  Pretty sad when the fries are better than the overpriced burger!

At the end of the meal, and after my wife and I talked to her separately to make it a surprise to our daughter, she came with the Bday ice cream by herself, put it on the table and said \"happy birthday,\" after that, there was a quiet moment where we all looked at each other thinking that it was a joke but she turned around and left.

I wanted to treat her to a nice, teen-oriented meal to celebrate; this was NOT the place for any sort of celebration.  There were three tables filled (should have been a hint) six servers standing around the register and NOBODY actively assisting their tables.  We saw the waitress when she took our order and when she dropped off the bill and that was ALL!  The manager was the one who ran our food, who filled our glasses for the ONLY refill we got (and after we had been out of drink for twenty minutes) and got something the server forgot to include on the first order.  That manager ran herself ragged filling the requests of the tables in the restaurant, all while her servers stood and gossiped in the corner.  I tend to give servers the benefit of the doubt, but it was painfully apparent she had lost control of the people working under her.  She needs to speak to corporate about making some heads roll.  As for the food, it was subpar.  The tavern burger was the same as one of those value meal sandwiches you can get from the drive-thru for two bucks.  And there are no bottomless fries if you can't find the server to deliver them!  Don't bother with this place.  Not until the manager gets a backbone.",

This time the server we had, her name is Ariel. Ariel was nothing but smiles and treated us with just the best possible service possible. My kids we all smiles when she came and checked in on us. The food this time around was definitely a 180 from the last time. The fries were done, apps and main course time in between was perfect and the only thing that was a miss, was they forgot my tartar sauce with my fish (but i honestly think it was because i asked for a side of ranch for my fries, no biggie). Ariel brought the missing tartar over in a hurry. One thing i dont like about here but this could me being old school, the at table kiosk thing. I think its.a great idea for paying the bill, but i think it takes away from the interaction between the waitress and customer. Thats just my opinion on that. Overall, Ariel did an amazing job taking care of us, checking in and making sure our visit here was a good one. She definitely nailed it on the head. As for the food, definitely a better experience and we will definitely return.",

    "text": "Ok, I'll admit Red Robin is a guilty pleasure. There are times in every foodies life where you just want to get a burger with your kids and not worry about the seven course tasting menu or what vintage of White Burgundy to order.   We went here to celebrate a special occasion with my oldest son, a meat-loving seven year old who LOVES Red Robin (god bless him!) Atmosphere is fairly loud and busy with lots of TVs showing either sports or cartoons. Basically a kid paradise.  Many are suckered at Red Robin by the various burger combo's, typically which include bacon, some sort of sauce and an assortment of fried products on top. Blah. Not only do these mask the flavor of the beef, but they also reduce your life expectancy by at least six months. As a result, I order the \"natural burger\" with a whole wheat bun, lettuce, tomato, red onion and blue cheese. My better half ordered one of their new fancy salads and my Little Man ordered the cheeseburger. Ironically we also ordered the mini-app of onion rings (also known as the cardio-kicker). Can't resist onion rings, damn it!  Overall, no problems with this meal AT ALL. The steak fries that come with the burgers are pretty good and the Red Robin seasoning is addictive. The burger itself was a good size, cooked well and the toppings were fresh and crisp. BTW, I highly recommend the whole wheat bun because it is fresher and more substantial than the mushy standard bun. The salad also looked pretty good (no wilted lettuce or weird chicken). This is not the gourmet burger offered at BLT or even Big Daddy's, but it was still very tasty and you could taste the beef.  We ended our meal with, what else, but a Chocolate Milk Shake. Perfection as usual.  Thumbs up to this mass-market marvel. Carry on Red Robin - go forth and spread your message of beefy goodness!",

Quality was mediocre - I expected better for a sit-down.  We have 4 kids, 17-11 and none were impressed.  My 14 year old son wouldn't even eat the chicken fingers (which he always loves at other places or at home) he ordered - they were pretty nasty.  None of the kids want to come back - and kids want to go out whenever possible! (has no bearing on my wife's cooking - she's great)",

But by the time we were ready to go the fickle kid decided nope, he wants a cheeseburger!   I tried to go to Big Daddy's but there was a 20 minute wait and the little guy said let's go somewhere else. I remembered seeing Red Robin further down the road so we went there and thankfully were sat right away. I got my nephew a kids cheeseburger and even with all the options for sides he wanted apple slices. I got the chicken caprese sandwich.   The food came fast, which is good with kids. I wanted a burger but knew I'd be better off with the chicken, so I tried a bite of the kids and it was really good. My sandwich was good too, basically grilled chicken on a soft ciabatta bun, with lettuce, balsamic marinated tomatoes and surprisingly good fresh mozzarella. I asked for the pesto aioli on the side. It came with the steak fries but I only ate 3 of them. Not a big fan of these wish they were crisper.   All in all a pretty good experience and definitely reasonably priced.",

The place was hot, our table was uncleaned, and the service was abhorring.  Nowhere on the gift card did it state cash items had to be purchased to use the gift card, yet the manager insisted that we had to order something & pay cash to use it.  We chose to order a kid's meal, (nowhere does it state adults cannot order this) using the gift card, & he started yelling & screaming, again, refusing service.  Bad thing is, corporate sent the gift card, stating kids meals or anything could be ordered.  This manager was literally screaming, and very offensive. Other Red Robin Restaurants have Never treated us this way, but were kind & accommodating.  Will NOT return to this location-",

The burger are not fresh to the point where we compared it to gas station flavored food. The hook of getting you in this place are the \"bottomless sides\" where guest are free to reorder endless side items like fries. The kids menus are reasonable since it includes sides and a drink (up charge for specialty sides/drinks). I cannot think why one would choose this place over the likes of Bad Daddy's where the burgers are priced the same with better taste. This truly will be the last time we would even think of going to again. The service was good so there was a bright side.",

However if they don't change some of the menu items back the way they were, I may never eat here again and I've talked to quite a few others who have said the same.  Their salads used to be delicious..  That is until they changed everything about them and now they are a huge disappointment.  They are served on a long plate and are about half the size they used to be and several toppings were non-existent (like the hard boiled egg it clearly says should be on there!!). The pretzel bites, which you typically can't go wrong with were gross.  And We have always been able to order whatever salad you wanted with the soup and salad combo but not anymore apparently.  Huge let down!  Thumbs down to my latest experience.  I hope they are smart enough to listen to their customer feedback and instead of trying to cut cost and skimping on their dishes, serve what the consumer wants which ultimately leads to more consumers and more money!",

A quick survey on Buzzfeed, claiming to tell you what you were in the mood for for lunch, led us to the local Red Robin.  Before I get to Red Robin, let me say whoever is writing the algorithms at Buzzfeed deserves a raise because they were spot on.  Now on to Red Robin.  Red Robin is the perfect example of the old addage \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"  I had this place pegged all wrong. From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like family.  John, our waiter, was having a rough day with a malfunctioning credit card machine, but if you think that changed his care and attentiveness, think again.  When he came to take our orders, I went with the Madlove burger.  Talk about fun.  If a burger topped with bacon, avacado, and onion strings is something that gets your taste buds tingling I strongly recommend this, if not read through the menu and pick out something that makes your mouth water.  A co-worker summed up my first Red Robin experience perfectly \"this beats a freaking salad any day.\"  On the door Red Robin proudly hangs a sign that reads \"You'll be Happy Here,\" what they forgot to mention is how sad you'll be to leave.  Until next Red Robin, I thank you.",

We had finished almost half of our sandwiches before the fries finally made it out.   However, whent they finally appeared, the fries were fresh and hot... and my chicken teriakyi sandwhich (with lettuce, tomato, grilled pineapple and swiss cheese) was good.   A couple of negatives about the place, they have several tiny two seater booths that just do not have enough table space. Also, I wish they would serve the sandwiches on a plate rather than in the baskets that they normally use.    The place is very family-friendly and normally a good place to visit for a fast casual meal.",

I've had good service and bad service at this restaurant but I will say this, the management is always willing to make things better.

I have literally watched my food just dieing in the window. They only reason I go there is because my daughter loves the place. Good atmosphere to take gets, just not a descent meal.",

His attitude was really contagious and we quickly realized that there was a HUGE difference from our last visit. Ryan kept our glasses full and our burgers were served promptly, hot, and as ordered. We had a great time tonight and will definitely be back!! Thanks Ryan for making our Friday night out so enjoyable!",
