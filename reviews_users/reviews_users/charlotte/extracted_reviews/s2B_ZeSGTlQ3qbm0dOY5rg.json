    "text": "I'm so torn bc I'm an original Andy's ( it will always be Andy's!!! ) so of course the food is great. However, at this new location my food was sub par. My burger was cold, bacon was hard, and my requests were ignored. I don't know if some of this has to do with the service bc everyone in there seemed very distracted. It was like in school when your teacher steps out for a minute and everyone goes crazy. Everyone was very nice but just bc you're nice doesn't mean it's quality service. I had to ask 3 times for my missing fries which I wanted crispy but just gave up on that, 3 times for a cup of hot sauce and wave down someone for refills. I know that might sound petty but wait staff is supposed to offer refills, right? When we were still eating someone came over and announced our total. I'll probably stick to the university location but thanks for the good food.",

    "text": "This place is relatively new so I was willing to overlook the fact that we were ignored for over 10 minutes after sitting down. After I inquired we saw  the servers discussing our table; evidently there was confusion about whose table it was. After ordering my coworker went to the restroom and upon returning a different server came over and asked her if she had found a cell phone in the restroom. She told her she had not. The burgers were good and the shake was good too. The bills for both of us were incorrect but since they were close to what we got we just paid them. Then we rose to leave and as we got close to the door a manager and another server blocked our exit. The manager said are you sure you didn't find a cell phone? My coworker said no. My coworker felt like she was being accused, and said I don't even have a purse. The manager replied, 'well, we keep pinging it and it comes up to your area' pointing at our table. My coworker assured her again that we didn't have her cell phone. It was very upsetting to be accused of stealing a cell phone when we were just trying to eat lunch. I phoned the store later in the afternoon and spoke to the manager and told her who I was and asked if she had found the phone. She said oh yes. She was flippant and uncaring about the way she had treated us. The entire staff was unprofessional. The food was good (not great) so I gave a star for that. We will not return or encourage others to visit.",

The staff don't seem like they want to be there and they are not very attentive and I hate that I sounded so needy but when I picked up my to go order majority of the staff were standing around aimlessly until I had to wave someone down to let them know I was picking my order up. Placing my order over the phone was even a headache. When I got to paying for my order i asked for an itemized receipt and the girl gave me the most confused look on her face as if I asked for my money back. I would like to give them a try again but id hope to have a better experience.",

    "text": "We were excited to find something along the lines of South 21 in the Steele Creek area so we tried Highway 55.  It's trying to be a 50s theme diner offering hamburgers and hot dogs etc.  The food was ok, but the cooks and servers mishandled it to the point that the side dishes came out long before the burgers so they sat and by the time we got them they were no longer hot.  The burger was reasonable and had my onion rings been piping hot they'd have been much better.  The sweet tea was good and they offered a tiny spoon sample of a flavored custard... but as the waitress hands it to us she says \"I don't think we have enough to make you anything with this, but I just wanted you to taste it...\"   What?  How is that making a sale?  How is that helping the customer decide on a dessert?  Just an awkward interaction for no real purpose ...  it was odd.  There were no less that 6 employees standing towards the back talking and laughing... a tired sight at places like this.  They haven't been open very long so maybe they'll get better.  We'll give them a while and try it again.",

She can't be more than 6 years old and she was wearing the same black pants and pink uniform shirt as the rest of the employees.   She came to our table and introduced herself as \"your waitress\" and took our drink orders.  She checked on us several times while we ate and upsold their products.  When I declined to order one of their shakes for dessert she took the folder feom her apron, selected my check from the several she had and lay it on my table.  I watched her press buttons on the touchscreen register to process my payment as an adult employee watched and supervised,  I guess.  My first act upon leaving the restaurant was to call the non emergency number for the police.  There was no answer so I called 911 and told them it wasn't an emergency but here's what is going on and can they send someone to remind these people that child labor is illegal.  They gave me the non emergency number for the sheriff department.  I called and reported the facts and asked again if they could send someone.  They gave me the number for the state OSHA complaint line that operates during business hours.  I guess I'll leave a message in case anyone cares.",

    "text": "Ok with the good. They are family friendly, A LOT of friendly waitstaff, and with lots of seating.  The bad is a bigger list. This is a more expensive Steak n Shake, with higher prices and average milkshakes. We were there with another family, so we had 2 waitresses. Unfortunately, the other family had their orders taken 15 minutes before our order was. So, we watched  them eat for 30 minutes before our food came out. We realized why there are so many people working there, to deliver the food. As the food is ordered, it is cooked and placed out in the ticket order. The manager was yelling at them to stay in line, in order, so the food could be given to the right person. All the burgers look the same, the staff can't tell the orders apart. You would think the ticket would be placed with the basket or something to help the delivery process. I ordered the grilled chicken with pepper and onions, with coleslaw, fries, and Texas toast. Well, the chicken was just same old grilled chicken, kind of bland, and with no peppers or onions. The coleslaw was good. The fries were no different than frozen fries that were fried. This meal cost just shy of $10. The rest of the family ordered burgers. My husband didn't even get his burger, they forgot the onion ring and bbq sauce. The one thing that was supposed to make it different than the cheeseburger he received. His chili cheese fries were fries with liquid cheese and canned chili, no different than 711.  So, then they ordered dessert, milkshakes. My husband asked what flavor ice cream they have, um only vanilla, but you can put whatever topping you want to flavor it up. Then, you are left with a milkshake with big chunks that were stuck in the straw. We pay and leave. Multiple people were immediately sick. The pain created after was not worth this food.  Overall, the price and quality of the food was not good. I get it, it's burgers. But a place that specializes in burgers, we just expected more with less pain.",

    "text": "I know that this location just opened so... I'll try to be a little easy on the negatives...  Let's start with the negatives:  1.Frazzled staff. I went on a weekday and got there right at 2pm, usually when the lunch rush is winding down.  The place had many employees but they all were running around all over the place and when I entered, I was asked to take a sit after I told them I'd be dining in. I sat for five minute as waitresses walked by me a hundred times before I had to get up and say \"Hey, can I get some service?\" They were really polite and apologetic.   2. Over-priced. I spent $11.00 and change (plus $2.00 tip) on a chicken sandwich, gravy fries, and a soft drink.  The quality is maybe one step higher than fast food places and maybe one notch lower than franchise restaurants like TGIF or Chilies... yet, the price up there with Chilies. This is due to them offering only one combo for a burger, so if you want a burger and fries and not a chicken sandwhich (fried or grilled), it's way more expensive as there were no combo options (I asked).   Really, that's all.   Pros:  1. Atmosphere. It is clearly doing the 50s vibe, with the layout, decorations, colors, and oldies music playing.  It was relaxed, had plenty of space, and is overall a good place to go to lunch.  It was very clean, obviously since it just opened.    2. Food. While overpriced due to no combo values, the food was good. I'll be trying more menu items as time goes by, just to get some variety. It's greasy, it's fattening, it's delicious.  My fried chicken sandwich was tasty and this being the first time I've had gravy fries, I am now a fan of them.  As I've said, I would say it's one notch higher than fast food like Zaxby's, a place I really like by the way, and about a notch lower than TGIFs, another place I really like, so this is a compliment.",

First off, this place is near the industrial/manufacturing area and other businesses, there's a big lunch crowd, we don't have 2 hours to eat lunch. We waited over 5 minutes after was told to sit down for someone to notice and bring over the menu. There were 4 waitresses, and only 4 tables at the time. It should not take over 20 minutes to make a few burgers, that's unacceptable given there were 4 kitchen staffs. The buns were too thin and soggy, I'm always up for a greasy burger but it was just off. I'd rather pay a few more bucks and go down to five guys. My friend had to go and ask for the check, was told she'll bring it to our table but she forgot so we ended up having to just stand at the register. It was getting pack when we were leaving, if we waited over 20 minutes for our food with 4 tables, everyone else might have to wait an hour.",

Side eye (lol) well everything was ok I can say I enjoyed the sweet tea but that was about it the burger and fries were both blah to me not what a burger should be  in my opinion. The one thing that did it for me tho was when I entered the ladies restroom and it was not clean,sanitary looking at all which is one of my pet peeves about any restaraunt a clean bathroom, there was tissue every where,the floor appeared unclean as if it needed a good mopping and sweeping, this tops it i even seen the toilet brush u use to clean the toilet thrown onto the side of the toilet ,its pretty safe to say I probly won't ever visit this burger joint again.",

I should have known it wouldn't go well when I ordered a coke or Pepsi only to be told they were out.   We ordered appetizers and didn't have them come out until our meals were ready. Our meals sat ready to be delivered to us for almost ten minutes before they brought them to us. By then the food was cold. The kicker? It was dead. There were only two other tables filled.   My daughter ordered a poutine and what she got I have no idea. It looked nothing like a poutine and it didn't have any gravy like the menu said.  I ordered a side of gravy with my fries and never got it. When I asked for it again that's when she told me that they didn't have Gravy. Which explained my daughter's poutine. So instead of telling us that to begin with she brought my daughter fries and cheese curds with no gravy. My son ordered the kids hot dog and it came back bright red. I have no idea what was in that bun but it sure wasn't a hot dog.   I could go on but I'd rather not waste any more of my time. I will go back to another HWY 55 but it won't be this one and I highly recommend you look else where too.",

FIRST...I tried calling in my order (an attempt to save time) and was told to hold on before the call was disconnected twice.   SECOND... once I arrived at the register to place my order (opting not to complain because they were a little busy) I was greeted with \"I will get someone to help you\" and the young lady walked away to go chitchat with another waitress. Finally, I got the attention of another waitress that obviously saw the look on my face and asked if she could take my order. She was pleasant and quick.   This location has a young staff but that does not excuse the lack of professionalism and sense of urgency during the lunchtime rush. I waited 20 minutes for two hot dogs.   If the other fast food places didn't have such a long line, I would've just bypassed this place and kept it moving.",

I was told, through a forced smile, to sit where I like. Three of the four available tables were still dirty. After being seated, we waited 18 minutes before a friendly waitress (Alia I believe her name is-she earns a whole star by herself) asked if we'd been helped. After giving us menus and a couple minutes to look it over, our orders were placed and repeated back to us with, \"Your food will be ready in five minutes.\"  Twenty-five minutes later our baskets were placed before us: a small burger (regular size) and a blt, both with fries (which my wife is pretty sure were Ore-ida brand). The top bun of my burger was stale, about a third of it was chewy and my last bite I could bear was actually crunchy. I left the last third behind. My wife's blt was promised \"5 pieces of bacon,\" and that's what she got: five small pieces of bacon. Three on one half and two on the other, not even enough to cover the soggy bread. The lettuce was wilty.  The custard (described as \"premium ice cream made daily\") earns the other star.  This stuff is pretty amazing, and the only reason I'll go back. In fact, I watched one couple pop in and out with a milkshake each, ordered at the bar. I could tell they had been there's before!  If you don't love ice cream, this place is totally skipable. We had good interactions with our waitress, but the food was disappointing. I'd rather go to Cookout and take it home.",

    "text": "Hwy 55 gives me a Moe's vibe. As soon as you walk in, everybody choruses with a \"Welcome to Hwy 55!\" I thought it was pretty cute. They're probably tired of doing it, but it's pretty fun to me.  I've been twice with the husband and we've only ever sat at the counter because it's just easier. I do like watching them prepare the food, though! I wanted to kidnap the lady running the kitchen the last time we went through. She was keeping those food times low and keeping everything in line in there. I need that type of organization in my kitchen! Oh, wait. It's just me, though. Never mind. Talking to myself might make me seem crazy.   Anyway, let me start backward here. The custard. It's insane. They have these things called concretes that are basically like Blizzards, but better. You can get anything from the custard area blended into it. They've got a decent list of candy options and they also make special custards of the day. Both times I've been, I was offered a sample and it was rocking. Give it a shot.  Now, the food. The first time we came, I went straight for a burger and I was glad I did. You can tell the burgers are fresh and well seasoned. I got a pretty bare bones cheeseburger, but it was still fantastic. Juicy with a nice crisp on the outside. I really loved the fries that I had the first time. I think they were more of the fresh-cut ones, but they've switched to the crinkle ones now. The crinkle ones are decent, but I *loved* the first ones. The second meal for me was the Philly sandwich. It was filling, full of flavor and I really enjoyed the bread. I think they may have steamed it, so it was nice and soft. I hate having to try and tear through a piece of hard roll on a Philly, so this made my day! They even give you a knife and fork in case you need it.   Overall, this is one of my favorite new places in the area and I'm really glad I don't have to break out the grill at my house for just one burger. I can just come on down to the Hwy!",

She was fast, fun and friendly! She gave us a quick rundown of the menu and offered some great suggestions. I opted for the meal deal which is a burger, fries AND a drink for only $7.99. What a deal - and you can make any modifications you want to your burger!   When our food arrived it was hot and fresh. My burger was seasoned and the fries were nice and crunchy! Just like it should be! I'd absolutely return to this place and I HAVE to try one of their milkshakes.",

And the young lady that's managing make sure she stops by at least once if not twice to check on you and how your food is I think that's a wonderful thing. Looking forward to my next visit there also I've been stopping by and getting the salads to go wonderful wonderful salad just the right size for lunch. Someone is looking at this from Highway 55 please thank your employees they're doing an outstanding job there's a lot to choose from in that area. But this is the place I like to go thank you",

The staff was friendly, the decor is adorable and definitely has the vibrant 50s theme going.   The food was typical diner food and it was great. My husband has been hunting for a really good chili cheese dog for a very long time and he's finally found it here. The texture and flavor of the chili are spot on. His only wish is that they offered a shredded or sliced cheese vs the liquid (they actually might, he didn't ask). I got the steak and cheese which was good. Not the best I've ever had but I would order it again. We also split onion rings and chili cheese fries which were all great. I like chunky onion rings. The kids meals come in a little truck which I thought was adorable as well.   Before we left I was sure to get an Oreo milkshake which was delicious.   We will definitely come back again in the near future and give the burgers a try.",

The portions were small, the chicken bland, and the food was cold due to the above mentored ac issue. No explanation offered why the food took so long to arrive.

The place has the vibe of a 50s burger joint and that's one of the best things I can say about this place.   I looked over the menu and decided on a cheesesteak but they were out of steak. My second option was the John Boy & Billy chicken sandwich which was described as a kicked up version of their regular chicken sandwich. Also ordered tots and an unsweetened tea.  The sandwich was bland. There was nothing kicked up about this whatsoever. The tots were crispy but also bland.   I ordered a shake to go but they were out of ice cream. Another strike.   Looking around the place they have serious ventilation issues looking at the air vents they are all dirty/rusty.  But the health score says 'A'.   With them being out of 2 things I ordered and the fact that there were only 3 tables occupied during peak lunch hour, I'd guess this place isn't going to last much longer. Food is mediocre at best. But the music is good but I don't think that can save them.",

    "text": "Ok, sorry but I was so unimpressed and disappointed with Hwy 55, I would not return to this location anytime soon.  I was craving a hamburger, a rare occasion, and was on my way to the Charlotte Outlet Center and saw this location just a few minutes away. I arrived a few minutes past 12:00pm and the parking lot was empty...maybe that should have been a sign.  Upon walking in there were three or four servers standing around, and two line cooks.  They told me to sit \"wherever\". After choosing a booth the waitress brought me a menu and I decided to order the All American Cheeseburger with Fries and a Hot Dog, all the way. Why not try a few things to get a feel for what I might like.  Less then three minutes later my food arrived. The burger was so overcooked, and tasted like packaged meat I was not impressed. And, I love all the toppings, lettuce, pickles, ketchup and mayo, but when the mayo overwhelms the entire burger it is a little too much. The fries were definitely precooked and so overdone they weren't even edible. And, one thing I will add, which I saw in another review, they over salt everything. And, I love me some salt, but I couldn't even do it.  As for the hot dog, I don't think I have ever seen a neon pink hot dog before, nasty. The cole slaw and chili on top was straight out of a can and disgusting.  Obviously there are some great reviews, so I am not sure if I went on an off day, but based on the fact that Charlotte offers too many great hamburger and hot dog joints I will definitely not be returning to Hwy 55 anytime soon.",

    "text": "Friendly and Efficient with Good Fast Food  Frustrating visit to the Outlets but since it was lunch time, decided to try someplace I had not been to in the area. Used to like the Hwy 55 up our way but after 6 months, service dropped off and have not been back since.  Wanted to see what this one was like.  Walked up the door and one of the employees greeted me on the sidewalk, opened the door for me and took me by the arm and escorted me into the building. All of this while welcoming me. As soon as I was through the door a number of employees shouted out greeting as well.  I was made to feel at home and this is how the one up our way started out.  This location has been open a little over a year and they seemed to have maintained that enthusiasm.  Told to sit where ever I wanted so I chose a booth and sat down and a server was t here immediately to take my drink order and bring me my menu.  I initially thought about the current special of a two hot dog combo but decided instead on the John Boy and Billy Chicken Sandwich along with fries. I was given a choice of grilled or fried and since I'm trying to watch my diet, I chose the grilled. Note: Fries are a separate menu item and not served as part of the sandwich.  While I waited, I looked over the restaurant and it's a typical Hwy 55 or what used to be Andy's before re-branding.  50\"s theme with color of pink and light blue or should I say, Art Deco with vinyl records and other items from the time on the wall. The ladies wear pink shirts with the name Pink Ladies in a reference to Grease. Piped in music is more 60's that 50's but at this point in time, does not matter. Good through back.  The John Boy and Billy Chicken Sandwich is quite good and more than a mouthful. The Sauce on it tends to overwhelm the taste of the Chicken. Biggest distraction was the tomato which unfortunately was on the crispy side if you can believe that (under ripe) with little taste. Maybe as we get later into the season and we have more local produce, this problem will disappear.  Fries were pretty good. Nice an crisp and not raw in the inside like so many other places server them. This place does them right.  If you're in the Charlotte Premium Outlet area, this is a great place for lunch.  It's on the north side of I-485 while the mall is on the south side, if you exit the Mall to the north, you end up on Shopton Rd and the restaurant is on the right in a strip mall.  If you come out on Hwy 160, turn left and go over I-485 and the restaurant is on your left.  Enjoy",

    "text": "The deals on yelp for this place are great. Was shopping at the outlets waiting for a flight when I took my family here. The food was amazing I had the moose and my family all had burgers. The steak sandwich's we orders were amazing we shared the two and the burgers were fresh. Service was fast despite being pack. I would for sure recommend and return when in town. Jatayah was an awesome server hustling and great friendly service. Not to mention the old time fashion style dinner with the music to go with the era are my favorite can not beat the environment and great food.",

Someone else mentioned the tater tots tasting like fish. I experienced that too. Hopefully they have a friatator dedicated to that role.  I spoke with the owner via email. Nice people. Give em a chance!  7/25/18 - update - much better. Clean store and burgers were typical Hwy55. I like 5 Guys but I personally think Hwy55 is better.",

    "text": "Classic 50s style American food restaurant. They have a menu with burgers, fries, hot dogs and of course ice cream and shakes. It was fairly easy for me to find and a huge plus was that there was parking literally in front of the restaurant. Who doesn't love not having to take a long walk in the parking lot when you're starving?! I got a cheeseburger with American cheese, mustard chili, bacon and an onion ring. The fries were some of the best fries ever and I usually don't like fries nor do I finish them. These fries were good. The burger was good too. I'm not going to say how quickly I finished it but I got it to go and finished it before I got off the exit lol. Next time I'm going to try one of the ice cream sundaes or milkshakes. I was a little hesitant because I heard it was on the expensive side but the burger meal was around $10-$12. On my cheap days I hate when I pay $12 for a burger and I don't get a drink! Like seriously why?! Great place to try if you ever come across one.",

The first bite of that burger...I literally heard music.  In addition, the customer service and employees were friendly, warm and inviting.  If you're looking for a juicy, fresh and yummy burger, this is it!!",

Took 20 minutes just to get our order taken and then 35 minutes to get our food with only 3 other tables in the whole restaurant. I actually had to go up to the register and wait for someone to come help me just to pay my check! Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else and skip the hassle, headache and aggravation for just mediocre food.",
