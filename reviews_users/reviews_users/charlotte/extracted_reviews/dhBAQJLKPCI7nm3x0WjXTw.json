    "text": "Pros- spicy tuna bowl was really good. We loved the rice and overall combination of flavors.   Peach tea was good and crushed ice always rocks.  Menu is interesting - lots of combo bowls.   Lobster roll was tasty. But:  Cons- it was the tiniest lobster roll I've ever seen! It was on a little Hawaiian bun rather than the larger, longer tradional toasted roll. We spit both things and half the roll took 3 bites to finish. It was not priced like a single slider... $22! I recommend Dean and Deluca(3 sliders for same price)  or the place near Talbots/ Southpark(based in Florida). They used to have delicious lobster rolls on Fridays.   It came with  a large portion of fries but they were not hot and they lacked flavor.   There were a lot of employees and everyone was pleasant but there seemed to be a lack of focus on helping customers at the counter. You have to order and pay at counter first and food is brought to table.  (Pet peeve- paying same or more for food at places that don't offer full service.) This was lunch but they do have full service at dinner.  No regular brewed tea.  We plan to back one weeknight for half-price oysters. The variety looked really good. I'd like to try the poke nachos too.   I'll keep my eyes out for lobster roll improvement!!",

He had a great attitude and was so easy to talk to! Attentive but not overly so, he really made tonight a treat. It's pretty rare that service stands out like that these days, we really appreciated it. Go check it out, keep an open mind and let Caleb point you in the right direction!",

    "text": "Loved my poke rainbow bowl,  just with a few tweeks. I got it with no cabbage or cucumbers but added wasabi peas, edamame, pepper flakes & cilantro. I highly recommend their creamy sauce, taste like a lighter spicy mayo. All of the other sauces were much more of a thinner liquid & clear ish. Their super kind worker let me try a good portion of their options, which I didn't expect at all but I'm glad bc I don't think the others were my type, but they were interesting. I'm sure the plus is that It is healthier.  The bd tried the lobster roll which he said must be their huge seller bc 4 out of 5 people ordered it when he kindly glanced at other guests plates. It was tasty, semi sweet & he absolutely loved it. It was on the small side for him (if he was starving) but the plus is they give you great quality portion, big meat but smaller bread. It's a good thing he had breakfast.  Their strawberry cooler I liked better than the peach tea. Strawberry had more flavor and the peach tea was more of a light refreshing taste but I still liked both. Big plus for having infused water and I like their ice! Not cubed, not slush, but good. And I adore the fish lines they painted in the parking lot instead of the regular straight line, never seen that anywhere else! Would love to come back for the oysters, we thought it was a good price.",

I ordered takeout for my boyfriend and I. He had the Ahi Tuna Bowl and said it was good. The drawbacks to this place are the atmosphere and the price. It's trendy so we expected it to be more expensive than it should be, so that wasn't a surprise. The atmosphere wasn't my style. Pretty cold, but I didn't eat there so I don't want to judge something I didn't experience. It's definitely worth a try but I'm not sure we will be back.",

You know how you can taste if the fish was fresh... it was fresh. Actually all the ingredients were fresh and in good combinations. We ordered the regular vs the large bowls and that was plenty of food. Cool space, clean vibe with good sized community table and places to have one on one conversations. I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 because of the price of the beer. Cans are in a cooler next to the cash register and we grabbed two local / non-seasonal / did I mention local /beers. No listed prices anywhere we could see and paid $7.00 and $7.50 for two local beer cans. I expect that pricing at a concert or sporting event, not for a quick lunch.  We will be back, and will order waters - unless they allow BYOB.",

I went to the restaurant this week to purchase takeout for a lunch meeting. To say I have been DYING to try it is an understatement. First, I can walk to it. Second, I love sushi and poke bowls. Third, tons of my friends had posted the most beautiful Insta posts and positive comments.   The place the gorgeous. The staff is so enthusiastic. But not through or detailed oriented enough. I wasn't given a \"place card\" when I ordered but didn't realize I needed it. Multiple times staff came over to ask me if I had a question and was ready to order and I told them I had already ordered. They brought me my to go bag and I grabbed some chopsticks and left. After I got back to my home office and was preparing for a meeting I found that they did not include one of the items we ordered. When I call back, The first thing they said is oh you forgot your nachos. I didn't forget it they didn't give them to me. Sorry, I'm just a pet peeve about the customer is always right and you should never say anything to make them feel like they are wrong. Especially when they are not wrong. Theyvasked if I could come back which wasn't possible so then they said they would talk to their manager and I would have a credit next time I came. I will update this review based on the next time I come and if that works out.  After getting off the phone with them, I opened my bowl and started to eat. That's when I realize that they completely ignored the instructions that I gave them and I saw on the computer screen. No Mandarin oranges no red cabbage. See this bowl, they didn't listen. Even though it was clearly printed on the screen that I saw when I ordered.  The reason it is 3 Stars and Not 2 is because the food was great. But they got two strikes on a to go order. You cannot fix that customer experience after they walk out of the door so you have to guarantee the orders are accurate. FYI - I went early so it wasn't super slammed.  I will definitely try again but hope this review makes everyone double triple check their to go bags before leaving",

I have been back several times since and the food has always been excellent. Seafood lovers need to give it a try when they get a chance.",

Would have rather had a larger roll and paid $28.00. That being said the roll wasn't tail. It was packed with succulent knuckle and was tasty. But, I have had better, thus the 4 stars. Also, those that are saying the portions are small for the bowls, I don't agree. 8.50 is reasonably priced! Considering Charlotte is very behind every other decent city when it comes to a variety of food, I will be back!",

Their sliders were delicious. I really enjoyed the wagu beef slider but was disappointed by the fried oyster slider. For $4 it should have had a minimum of 2 oysters for the size of the bun. I will definitely be trying HI Tide again.",

In short, if you love poke, seafood, or oysters, you HAVE to come here. The service is very friendly and very helpful without being pushy. The atmosphere is perfect for an authentic seafood place. Not too stuffy, but has the polish of a well-managed restaurant. I got a bottle of Coke from the cooler, and when I went up to the counter to order and pay, the employee asked me if I'd like a cold glass, and pulled a glass out of a cooler with ice. I loved that touch. So simple, but so thoughtful.  My boyfriend got one of their speciality poke bowls and I got the lobster roll with fries. The lobster roll was amazing and the fries were super fresh and seasoned perfectly. I spent summers in New England and know how a real lobster roll should taste and they nailed it. My boyfriends poke bowl was delicious and full of flavor. I noticed that they have half off oysters 4-7 on weekdays, which is a deal I plan on taking advantage of in the near future. Love this spot.

Food: Flavors are extreme- seaweed salad was so salty and they re- dished it but still quite salty...we asked what it was dressed in thinking maybe overuse of aminos but our server was unsure.   Ate the 5 small pieces of hamachi that came with my small yuzu hamachi bowl and the spiraled cucumbers and long strips of carrots and left the rest because it was so acidic.  I LOVE acidic foods (hence why I ordered yuzu) but balance is needed in this dish. My partner ordered sliders (which didn't come on Hawaiian rolls as stated on menu) and the rainbow bowl and agreed that we will give them some time to work it out before maybe trying it again. (He was a little stuck on being served canned oranges though so not sure how soon that will be)  Service: Good. Our server seemed to be the only one so refills on water took a bit which is understandable but she was quick to try to help rectify the salad being overly salty and removed from check.  Ambiance: cute place but staff yelling across restaurant about the corn being cooked wrong then cleaning grill an hour before closing left a poor impression.    In short, I am waiting on my room service now.",

It was small inside and we were a big group- but it worked out well on a Thursday and we never felt rushed or crowded and we were there for a while. Half price oysters were also excellent. Poke bowls are small- even the large so it's worth it to pay the extra few dollars for more.  Thank you to the establishment we enjoyed our experience.",

The positive of the restaurant was that it had unlimited toppings. Once we chose a protein however it was very little maybe five pieces  in a regular. We ordered oysters and the seaweed salad. The seaweed salad originally looks different. It has more of a Hawaiian theme. We took a few bites and it was delicious and then we found a piece of hair in the seaweed salad.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Hi Tide after seeing their Lobster Fest event advertised on multiple Charlotte Foodie instagrams. When we arrived it was busy, but not crazy. We ordered a lobster roll and poke bowl and were given a playing card as a number (which seemed to be very confusing for the food runners - they had to come close to every table just to see the specific card). We waited...we waited some more...people came, ate, and left and we still were not fed. After 45 minutes of becoming increasingly hungry and impatient I asked the female food-runner to confirm that our food was coming. She looked very flustered and said \"I'll check hold on...I don't get paid enough for this\". She checked and let us know she told the manager as she continued to bustle around complaining to different diners about how little she was being paid which was odd. After another 10-15 minutes the manager came over and let us know that the ticket didn't make it to the kitchen for whatever reason and kept saying he had no idea what happened (assuring...a manager who has no idea what happened or how to handle it). After another few minutes he put the food in front of us and instead of offering a concession or making any real effort to mitigate our inconvenience he said \"here's a cookie to smooth you over\" and walked away. \"To smooth you over\"...really? Maybe I am a little more conscious of customer service and hospitality having worked in hospitality and property management, but I was pretty shocked.   The redeeming factor for Hi Tide is that their food was pretty good. Not the best Poke I've ever had but possibly near-best in Charlotte. I just don't know if I will feel right patronizing a restaurant with such poor customer service. I'm disappointed for sure...I still posted pictures of the food on @KenzieAteWhat because it looked nice (hence the 2 stars).",

    "text": "It just wasn't good.   I've been here once before and enjoyed it.  It's gone downhill since. They really seem to have cut corners and cut quality.   I'll start with the one good thing - the oysters. They tasted to be of high quality and were well cleaned.  There is nothing else positive to say.    The service was horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  Not rude, just inept.  We were there Forever.  We had to ask about our food several times.  We had to go to the counter to pay.  It was So bad.   The poke bowl:  It tasted like fast food quality poke. The quality was much better last time.  There wasn't much fish, mostly filler.  And the fish that was there was decidedly \"meh\".    We also ordered the poke nachos as an appetizer.  It came out 30 minutes after the poke bowl.  Yeah, 30 minutes.  The people across the table had come in well after us, eaten, paid, and left before this dish of suck showed up.  Here's were things get really Taco Bell.... the \"nachos\" were among the greasiest, fattiest, piles of excrement that I have come across.  Obviously, I'm not thinking \"healthy\" when I order anything that has the term \"nachos\" in it. But the polar opposite of the clean cuisine I'm looking for when I go out for seafood.    We just wanted to get out of there after we tasted the grease bomb nachos.  Alas... no server was present after waiting for 20 minutes.",

I dropped one star cause the ambiance is a little off.  Many of the Poke bars I've been too are similar to the Chipotle method of Orderring.  This place chooses to use a menu.  They are also mixed with a seafood store/aged meat seller. It all seams like a weird mix.  Plus the music seams loud.   Overall a great meal and a unique consent for the Queen City.   I wish them the best going forward.   Check this place out!",

This place is seriously so bad I wish I could give it 0 stars!   If you feel like paying $14 for a tiny ass bowl of mushy gross rice and mediocre fish (see my pics), then this is the place for you!   I weigh just over 100 lbs and I ordered the \"large\" poke bowl. I left the restaurant feeling like I didn't eat at all. We also ordered the poke nachos or whatever. If you want heart or kidney failure from sodium overdose, then this is the dish for you! The chips were SO salty and over seasoned with sauce that you can barely taste the fish. It felt so unhealthy. It's probably because they want to cover smell of the fish thats not fresh? Idk but it was so bad that I had to tell one of the waiters that it is too salty. He took it back and brought out another one that was the EXACT same thing that we just had. WTF?   Anyways the conclusion is that this place is pretty damn terrible lol. Maybe they think most people that come here don't know the concept of Poke and therefore will be fooled into buying their vastly overpriced disgusting tasting food?? who knows. I've been to places in Manhattan that give you way more food that's more fresh and cheaper!",

We decided to try it after they advertised for \"Lobster fest.\" I will say that the portion of lobster in their lobster roll was decent! (However I don't think they provide this on there typical menu.)   Seating is extremely crowded and odd. Most of their seating is at a community table. Basically, there is one long table where they seat multiple different parties. Then there are various 4 chair tables around it. However the space is pretty small so it quickly started to feel really cramped.     The food is pretty pricing, and really just was not up to par (taste wise-presentation was good lol).   Our service was excellent though, we had multiple people check on us and our waitress was great! And our food came out very fast.",

    "text": "It breaks my heart to review one of my once favorite places with a low star review. I am just extremely disappointed with the service and food quality the last few times I have visited HiTide.   I order takeout pretty often and I feel that I always get a smaller portion, items are often forgotten on my build your own bowls and just not as much love given to my dish.   This week we decided to go sit down and see if the quality of the food was better. My fiance just had knee surgery so he is on crutches, when we arrived the place was VERY busy. (Side note: it doesn't take much for it to be very busy because the place is way too small) Either way I came in to hunt for a low chair for my fiance because he can't sit at the high tops or stand for long. I saw a table in the far corner that only had one chair and wasn't being used. My fiance sat down and we were approached by a server and told they were on a wait. I explain my fiance's knee, we weren't trying to cut the line but it was obvious that this table wasn't being used since they didn't have enough chairs to go around. We were treated quiet rudely. No one every returned to our table to put us on the wait, I approached the counter and said we can just place a togo order since my fiance can't stand and y'all are on a wait. I was told no it's ok y'all sit there and we will be with you shortly.   Eventually our sever came over. He seemed flustered by the \"lobster roll special\" rush. We explained that we would do oysters to start, they were out of several on the board but we order 2 of each for a sampler. My server told us \"we really needed to go ahead and put our food in because it will take awhile\". We ordered our poke bowls as well and then next thing you know our bowls are on the table without or oyster app. I asked if he had forgotten to ring it in and they said oysters take a long time to prepare. (Mhm really? Shucking 8 oysters doesn't take long but ok) My fiances bowl was wrong, it was suppose to be half portions of two fishes and it wasn't plus a few ingredients left off. Then a few minutes later we were basically done with our dinner and the app of oysters shows up. The, what I believe was the manager, sat them down and walked off. She didn't tell me which oysters were which or tell me about the sauces or anything. Eventually our server comes back and we ask him. He didn't know either and had to go ask. Then I said \"I don't see any horseradish, May I please have some?\" The server points at a ramekin of ice \"it's right there\" like I am stupid or something. Apparently it was horseradish ice but how was I to know that??? Overall it was an awful experience and my fiance has sworn that we won't \"waste our money here again\".   I personally haven't sworn it off completely but I think they are really losing the spark they had upon opening! Poke places are opening all over these days... the competition's hot on their tails!",

Brioche bins are always a good go to. The slaw really complimented the taste of the oyster.  For my entree I ordered Spicy Tuna Poke bowl. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS..!  I'm not going to describe what's in the bowl, because I don't want to spoil your excitement when you come!  I highly recommend giving this place a try. If you are unsure what Poke is... It is diced raw fish. The proteins served here are familiar to what you would order as sushi.   Thanks Guys!",

There are three drink machines against the back wall and she didn't know what was in them.   Food: The $21 lobster roll was cold and tiny. The best part was by far the fries. The poke bowl was good but tiny, even though I ordered a small, it was really, really small. We also ordered poke nachos which were basically a big bowl of wonton chips with a few pieces of fish and some seaweed.   Service: They use a card system which is very inefficient so there was constantly someone asking you if what they were holding was yours. We got our first two things fairly quickly and then had to ask 20 minutes later where our third dish was.   Overall: We would go back but would definitely get large, overpriced, poke bowls only.",

    "text": "I am in LOVE with this place! We came here around 7 on a Saturday night, and there was no wait. The set up and ambiance was awesome; the best way I can describe this is laid back casual. The vibe is a True New England fish market, but a modern no-frills hip take on it.  We ordered the Poke Nachos, Lobster roll, Spicy Ahi Tuna Bowl, and the Seared Wagyu Bowl. First off, the Regular size poke bowl is a great size. For 8.95, the regular size is plenty to feed one person.  They also offer a large for $12.95 (which is prob what a large dude would eat if they were trying to pack the protein in.    The nachos were unexpectedly tasty! They're served on fried wonton crisps, and that is the perfect choice. You can tell the dish is really balanced, and that a lot of thought went into the elements.  The seaweed isn't your normal seaweed, and is a perfect touch. The creamy and spicy togarashi sauce ties the whole thing together without overpowering the tuna, and leaves you wanting more!  Bowl of our bowls were really really good, and I especially like how they have a sauce and accoutrements station at the tables; you can spice, sauce, and season the bowl to your liking! And for FREE. The soy reduction and lime ponzu were our personal faves, but they were all good.  Last, but not least, the lobster roll. OHHHH, the lobster roll. A moment of awed silence for this. I'm from Connecticut. The COAST of Connecticut. So when I tell you I've had more lobster rolls in my life than most people have had glasses of water, I'm not kidding. So believe me when I say, this is the BEST cold lobster roll that I've ever had.  { Only second to a hot lobster roll that I had in Maine, because... butter. } The lobster they use isn't over cooked or over-steamed, which happens a lot unfortunately. Their lobster is clearly great quality and properly prepared. And there's SO much of it!! It's a huge portion for only ~$20. Best part: it's not oversoaked in mayo or huge chunks of celery...it's light and fresh. Served on what is obviously a toasted Martins Potato roll (True connoisseurs choice for lobster roll), this is just perfection.  This new spot is no amateur hour, and is the product of what is obviously a lot of careful and deliberate planning from its owners.  Check it out ASAP, you won't be sorry.",

    "text": "I heard about this place via the rave reviews, but when I first walked in, I was greeted by the aroma of a fish market dumpster. I understand that they sell oysters and seafood, but when kept at the proper temperatures, the smell should never be an issue.  As a first timer, I wasn't sure what to get and asked the employee for some suggestions, but the nonchalant \"get whatever, I'm tired\" attitude put me off more than the odor. Come on, as a fellow service industry member, I try to be at minimum, pleasant to deal with when I'm in a bad mood.   When the food did arrive, I knew my nose didn't betray me. I know great quality and wasn't expecting that - I just wanted some good for the cash food. I won't bother spelling out my order because from what I could see behind the bar, the food quality isn't anything to write home about. Sadly enough, I've had better tasting meals at the Harris Teeter sushi bar. I was even willing to ignore the stench, the poor service, and the dirty seats and floors if the food was good like prior reviews insinuate. I fail to understand how the owners can let all of this slide in good faith, knowing that customers spend hard-earned coin for subpar food.  I guess I will stick to Pokeatery. Should have known. Thank you fellow Yelpers for advising me to toss $30 down the drain.",

It starts as a base of fried wonton crisps and then is piled high with tuna, avocado, cucumber, seaweed salad, scallions and delicious sauces! A steal for the price! Poke bowls are also on point. As were the kobe sliders. The service  here is excellent!! Order at the counter and grab a number  and a seat to wait on your food. During slower  times there is table service. Also, a nice selection of local beers and craft sodas are available as well. Definitely recommend!!",

The only flaw I saw was the toppings in the two bowls were slightly different and mine didn't have the spicy sauce.  The staffs were super super friendly. They let us take time to order and always walked by to check if we need anything. I got their peach green tea which was really good. They packed another cup for me to go when we finished our meal.   We will definitely come back.",

I only wish I had a more tuna to match the proportion of wonton chips and sauce. It was very filling.  My friend ordered the poke rainbow, which I will try on another visit.

Small restaurant that also played as a small fish market. They had different types of oyster ranging from $3-5 each with half off Monday to Friday 4-7. It was a clean establishment. We had the lobster deviled eggs that both my boyfriend and I LOVED. Then he ordered a poke bowl, (portion was really small), ahi with seaweed salad, kimchi, onions etc.... He said it was alright; nothing beats our poke spot in Ballantyne. I had the seared ahi burger and it was a big burger for me. The ahi has sesame seeds on it and had a good flavor. Our bill was $33 something so the prices wasn't bad. Our male server was nice and attentive and tipped 20 percent for him. Definitely will come back and will try the oysters during happy hour.",

To my own fault, I should've checked the box prior to leaving the restaurant. I don't eat beef but for some reason I had Multiple beef sliders when it was suppose to be oysters.   Today when I ordered again through Grubhub I created a \"build your bowl\" I was craving one after my rather daunting Friday meeting. I paid for a large but received a small. Additionally, over half of the items I requested to be in my bowl were missing. Sigh. So, needless to say my lunch was just Blah.   The quality of fresh ingredients is good, don't get me wrong but quality control on to go orders is an area that needs some attention. :(   Maybe, 3rd times a charm....",

My husband and I talk about HiTide often because the potential is all there, but execution is flawed and the portions don't seem to matter when you order a small/regular vs large. It seems like you get more noodles/rice, maybe a few more cubes of fish, but nothing else changes.   I stopped in yesterday for a takeout order, and the server/cashier at the counter was helpful but I was surprised to see I was being charged more for additions because I haven't had hat previously. One of the additions was excluded from my bowl and that was really aggravating after we had gone through it all twice. The portion was similar to when I've ordered a small/regular, meanwhile I ordered a large. It took about/just under 10 minutes to make the bowl which is fine, but I am generally displeased with the service/execution. I was trying to give HiTide another chance while my husband was away, but it may have sealed the deal for a while.   I'm sad to have to do this, but I think I'm going to give HiTide a break and try some other places in the area. I'd like to know that what I'm ordering is going to actually be in my bowl, and I'd like to know up front how many additions or substitutions I can have before being charged for them. The consistency is not there, and in a market where more and more poke places are popping up, consistency will be more necessary than ever.",

This one was unique compared to most other poke places because you order from the menu at the counter, but you don't see the ingredients when you're ordering and you don't watch them make it. They had a large variety of ingredients, but it was hard to order because I didn't know what several of them were. The person taking my order was helpful and tried to explain them to us.   We got our food quickly and really enjoyed it. The ingredients were high quality. They had most of the sauces on the table so you could try as many as you wanted.   The restaurant is fairly small inside, but there was plenty of seating for us. We sat at a large community table in the middle. In addition to poke, they have quite a few appetizer and seafood options.   I would recommend checking this place out if you are a fan of poke/seafood.",

    "text": "Hi Tide Poke & Raw Bar is a nice hybrid of a casual poke restaurant / oyster bar and (small) seafood market.    I stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday evening around 6:30 pm and had my choice of tables.   Oysters are half-priced from 4 pm - 7 pm -- they had about 6 options ranging from $3 - $5/oyster (before the happy hour special).  The oyster selection is up on a chalkboard - check out the 1-5 rating to determine salinity (5 is super-salty).    We started off with half a dozen oysters (3 varieties - all D-LISH) and a bowl of seaweed salad.  I love, love, love seaweed salad and order it frequently.  I have never had a seaweed salad like Hi Tide's version.  It's make up of 3-4 varieties of seaweed, sesame seeds, crispy garlic and mixed with a very light dressing.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.  I think it was an interesting flavor - worth trying - but, not something I would necessarily order again.    We both ordered large poke bowls (they're not huge - I would recommend the large for an average sized meal).  The fish and toppings were fresh and crisp.  There were 4 different sauces on the table to add to your fish (in addition to the sauce that came with your bowl), if you so desire.  They have a nice selection of beer, wine and sake.  Overall, this is a great option for a casual, fresh meal that feels a bit \"fancy\".",

We started with the Poke Nachos and I llllllooooooovvvvvveeeeddddd them! They were so good! A lot of times, dishes like this have few toppings and by the time you get half way through, there are just plain chips left. Not these! Even at the bottom, the wontons had some toppings on them. So tasty!  On this particular day, I was feeling crazy and decided to try my first raw oyster. My husband loves them so he ordered a few. I tried one (didn't die but I am not a fan). My husband loved them and said he would definitely get them again.  Lobster rolls were full of yummy lobster meat. I was expecting more of a sauce but either way, it was tasty! My husband's roll had a few pieces of lobster shell in it that he picked out but mine didn't. Neither of us particularly loved our sides (he got fries, I got chips), but we were so full from the Poke Nachos that it didn't really matter.  We will definitely be back and next time, my husband can keep the raw oysters for himself!",

    "text": "A poke invasion has finally swept through Charlotte. I'm not mad about it.   Located next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill, this spot serves up fresh poke bowls, oysters, and seafood rolls. There are 10 Hi Tide Signature Bowls (Regular: $8.95, Large: $12.95) to choose from and you can add toppings to those. There's also the option to build your own bowl with a laundry list of bases, proteins, toppings, sauces, etc. There are sauces on the table as well. If I'm getting a lobster roll, I'm dipping my fries in the sweet soy reduction. I also throw some sriracha in my ketchup.  Specials alert: all day long on Monday's: lobster roll with your choice of seasoned chips or fries $15.99. Big savings, they are usually around $23 (market price). Monday-Friday they do oyster happy hour from 4-7pm. 1/2 off fresh oysters. Note: regular price of their cheapest oyster is usually $3. I still say the steal of the menu is the Poke Nachos ($8.95). Delicious, big portion, and the unagi saucy is tasty.   They always offer free cucumber & mint water. They also have fresh daily made frescas and a delicious cold brewed Hawaiian Coffee with coconut cream. There's also a cooler with wine, champs, and beer options.   A heads up: the parking lot is kind of on the small size, you may have trouble finding a spot during peak lunch time.  The Stars are Just Like Us: Coach Ron Rivera sat at the table next to me during a trip here, so if anyone asks I technically had lunch with Riverboat.",

Here is my prior review:  Love the concept, love the place, wanted to love the food.  But...  I didn't.  Fish was fishy. They need to bump the quality up. The prices could be bumped to account for the quality improvement and still remain affordable. Small poke bowls are $8.95 and large ones are $11.95. When you consider the prices it remains a great value.   The Ahi Poke Nacho appetizer was good but the ratio of chips was too great for the tasty toppings.  Perhaps serve it in a shallower dish and get the ratio better so I don't have nicely topped chips on top and a bunch of dry ones below?  Nice  that they provide various sauces at the table. Love the beautiful wooden communal table.   As a long-time Charlottean I instantly recognized and felt immense nastalgia for the Fresh Fish sign from Butler Seafood, which occupie this space for many years. In a city that rarely celebrates its historic elements I was extremely pleased to see this sign prominently displayed inside!",

The pricing is decent.  A small bowl is plenty for one person ($10-11).  They have a menu but you can build your own bowl as well.  Everything looked and treated super fresh.  The interior is that rustic industrial that's so popular now but works well with this concept.  Plenty of seating inside and they are working on expanding their patio and getting it covered.    I'm glad I tried it and the location is central to Uptown, Myers Park and is right next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill.    I'll eat there again.",

I may try to build my own bowl and see if that makes a difference, I just didn't enjoy the seaweed salad in the bowl with some of the other ingredients. In my specific bowl there were too many red onions, and that flavor kind of took over.  The ingredients were fresh. I ordered the Ahi Tuna bowl with coconut rice. Everything tasted good, I was confused on the sauce situation--the bowl definitely needed some type of sauce on it. But the quality of the fish was fantastic and all the veggies etc. were crisp and yummy. I absolutely loved the pickled radish and would return simply to eat more of that. I got the regular and the portion was perfect for lunch.   I'm interested in other items on the menu such as the lobster roll and raw oysters, I love the concept and the interior is really bright and inviting. I think they will need to figure out additional seating because it's a popular spot with very little room to sit inside--the parking lot is also small FYI.   Again, overall it was really good. Ingredients were fresh, service was great--I'd like to go back and try some other items!",

After having a bowl tonight, I can only hope it does.   I chose to build my own bowl since I have dietary restrictions. As i was going through the list i was surprised by the options and how much I could pack into this vibrant bowl of fresh healthy foods.   I opted for the large, a $5 up charge, and I'm so glad i did. It was filling, but not too much (especially scone I had mostly fruit and veggies). The crispy tofu was better than most and didn't seem greasy.   I can't wait to take my husband here for the lobstah (New England way of saying it) roll. He will be wicked happy!  I don't think you could go wrong with the menu options or something you create yourself.   Next up for me, those nachos!!",

Don't get me wrong, I love sticky rice, congee and all but didn't care for the taste/texture of the milky rice base. Next time I'll definitely go for a substitute grain or just build my own bowl.

Boyfriend lives across the street and if I wasn't obsessed with him already, I'd probably still stick around just so we could continue hitting up this joint every weekend.  Everything is so fresh, flavorful, and delicious. I can't move past the signature shrimp bowl, but I have ventured out to try the waygu steak bowl as well as the wonton nachos. Nachos are probably/definitely not gluten free and man, did I regret it later; however, THEY WERE SO GOOD, I can't promise that I'll never order and suffer again.  The shrimp bowl is like heaven in a dish. Yummy, fresh shrimp, surrounded by pineapple and spices and vegetables, and I smother the whole thing in their Kuzu Lime sauce and I just really can't imagine myself happier than I am when I'm eating that thing.   I tried the waygu steak bowl - the steak was a little rare for my taste and the wasabi peas were a little spicy for my taste (I know, I'm a child, shut up). It was still great and it's my boyfriend's go-to bowl.  The nachos are otherworldly - wonton strips and delicious chunks of seafood and vegetables and it's all covered in this obscenely delicious creamy sauce that would make an old shoe taste good. Seriously. Get the freaking nachos.  Service is awesome - they've made fun of the boyfriend and I for literally coming in for 3 days in a row before. Stop making the food so damn good if you don't want to see our faces!",

It's like I'm cooking for myself except not really)  I digress. I added, said, 8 or so ingredients (which, by the way, is about the SAME as if I had ordered an \"off-menu bowl). Sorry, I digress again.  Ahi tuna was yummy, I didn't feel like it was fishy at all. They did forget the pickled onions, but I didn't ask for them so I can't ding a star.  Justin had some other type of bowl with rice in it (I opted for quinoa).  I wish there was a note on the menu that said quinoa contained nuts. I am assuming it was the quinoa. I do not have a death-allergy to nuts but I try to avoid and I was surprised they somehow ended up in my bowl.  Staff was all-hands and super friendly.  For a quick meal that won't bog you down, we'll probably be back again.  Their fish and beef prices were pretty solid, too, so I am glad I can finally get my hands on some more Faroe Island Salmon! Oh, and maybe some Waygu...",
