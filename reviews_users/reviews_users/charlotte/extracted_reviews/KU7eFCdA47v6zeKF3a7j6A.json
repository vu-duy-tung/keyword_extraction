Great place to go and have drinks and an appetizer, or go out for a nice dinner with friends and family. It has the ambience of a neighborhood restaurant, and while its in a nice place, you wouldn't expect to find such a nice place in a tucked away strip shopping area. Try it, you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "This is a neat little restaurant in the Arboretum Shopping Center. There aren't many of this type of upscale southern cooking in Charlotte. At least, I haven't seen any around. The atmosphere is great. They've got live bands playing occasionally. The food is actually quite good. One thing is that the portions aren't great and the price is a bit on the high side. The dishes are well plated, and you can tell they put time into the preparation of not only for taste, but also aesthetics.   The few times I've gone I ordered the fried chicken appetizer. That is very good. The chicken is tender and well marinated, and the breading is near perfect. For the main course I've ordered a fish dish. It was pretty good. I've also ordered the shrimp and grits. I believe that may be the signature southern dish. It was delicious. They lose a star due to portion size, but otherwise this restaurant is superb.",

    "text": "New South Kitchen is the former Dakota's, located in the Arboretum Shopping Center.  Four of us went for lunch yesterday - and I won't go back again.  Pretty limited lunch menu plus a buffet option (spaghetti and meat balls).  Menu was \"small plates\", \"salad plates\" and \"sandwiches\".  Didn't try any of the \"small plates\" but the fried okra salad was a pretty small plate too!  Two of us ordered the burger which was small and came with a choice of one side dish - fruit or potato salad.  This looked like the best choice at the table.  Fourth person ordered the grilled club - ham, turkey, cheese on a flatbread - with the same choice of sides.  No discernable trace of the turkey on the club sandwich and it was very spicy, much more like a quesadilla than a club sandwich!  And the potato salad was bland.  All menu items were priced in the $8 - $10 range.  Desserts were more creative than I've seen on the menu elsewhere - cheese plate, beignets, roasted bananas.  But for the price (comparable to Harper's, a little less expensive than Maggiano's), I was very disappointed.  In my humble opinion, smaller plates (which I really think are a great idea - most places give you way too much food) should also carry smaller price tags.  Am I being unreasonable here?  Lunch crowd was VERY sparse.  If this is indicative of their overall business, better try this place - if you dare - while you can!  To the table of three ladies seated in the booth beside us - if you're going to discuss the virtues of latex vs. lambskin for disease prevention at the lunch table, you might be better served having lunch at home rather than out in public!    Service was nice (not great), food was barely ok, prices way too high for what you got - plus you have to battle the Arboretum parking lot!  Only two stars.",

    "text": "Since moving to Charlotte in October of 2008, this has quickly become one of our favorite restaurants.  We have dined at New South no less than 20 times in the past six months and have never been disappointed.    Tucked away in the Arboretum, it has a rather cozy feeling for a place with a more \"modern\" design.  Our server (Jim) is very knowledgeable about the menu and is able to answer every question we have.  New South has a really cool mix of \"comfort\" foods.  I think we have tried at least half of the menu including a lot of their nightly specials.  The deep fried turkey (Sunday) is a favorite - I also like their meatloaf, the chuck roast, flank steak, and my favorite (which is the Monday night special) Fried Chicken.  The Grilled romaine salad and artisan cheese trays are great starters and the apple Charlotte is their best dessert.  I highly recommend New South for dinner.  They have different diner specials and drink specials every night so you may want to call or visit their website before you go.  I know that Tuesday is 1/2 bottle wine, Sunday is 1/2 wine by the glass.",

    "text": "ORIGINAL POST (ALSO SEE UPDATE BELOW)  New South is a go-to dinner place for us, for a reasonably priced, solid meal.  However, tonight was disappointing on a number of points:  We were seated at a booth that had a large patch of red duct tape over a hole in the seat (I hope this is very recent and temporary??).  We then sat about 5 minutes before anyone noticed us at a table, and then it was someone other than our eventual waitress.  The waiter who did greet us took our drink orders and promptly served us, followed soon by our waitress, who from then on did fine attending our table.  I ordered the mixed greens salad and forgot to ask for dressing on the side (my fault), and yes, it had too much dressing on it, but also just a disappointing salad for $6 -- greens and not much else, and the greens not all that fresh.  I ordered the flank steak, which I've had before and loved, but tonight I could only eat about 1/2 of it because of how chewy most of the meat was (some I just had to stop chewing and spit out; other parts I could get through by cutting really small bites and chewing a lot).  The dish was also overly sauced with a very salty brine that seemed to be mostly just W sauce.  The potatoes were pretty tasteless and watery (with some soft chunks in there too).  Green beans were crisp-cooked and good.  On the plus side, my husband ordered the pork, which he said was tasty and tender.  Also, you can't beat $4 for a generous pour of a very decent house cabernet.  Add to that their participation in Citipass and other discounts, and I am willing to overlook an occasional disappointing meal since the price is right, but tonight, yes, I was very disappointed in one of my favorite non-fancy restaurants.  UPDATE:  After posting this review above, the owner contacted me and offered to comp my meal.  I suggested I just visit again and give them another try, which we did tonight (11/11/11).  Everything was superb!  Got seated quickly, table visited & serviced promptly.  I had the red fish entree, and my husband had the pork shoulder.  Both were perfect, and the sides were great.  Loved the fresh greens \"slaw\" on the fish, and the braised squash.  Cooking time was still just a tad longer than some places, but the dining room and bar were both packed (Carrier Classic on the big screens), so I imagine there was just a temporary backlog as we were there at peak time.  I appreciate that New South offers deals in Citipass, etc.  Their menu is already affordable, so that makes it an even better deal.  I spoke to the chef/owner and his wife; both were gracious and interested in our impressions, and they comped our meal tonight.  It doesn't get much classier than that.  Thanks, New South.  We will be back!",

The place has a nice decor, colored chalk boards list the local farmers they use and also the local brews they offer. We came at 11:15 so this was brunch. We started with the fried green tomatoes, not my number one favorite but a top contender. My mother got the penne pasta with chicken, grandmother got the salmon with grit cakes and I got the lemon chicken sandwich and got the braised greens in the side.  Since we were served brunch we were also offered a biscuit or a sugar muffin- sugar muffin please!!! All 3 of us were happy with what we choose. Moms pastas had some good flavors but to me you can order that anywhere, nanas salmon had all kinda stuff going on, the grit cakes, Brussels sprouts, and the salmon on top, all were cooked GREAT! She also got a side of Mac n cheese which was totally not worth the extra $5 they charged her. My lemon chicken sandwich had goat cheese and a tomato compote with a nice herbal mayonnaise, I took the bread off for carb purposes and was happy with the way it tasted! The sugar muffin ended up being a happy surprise and dessert!",

Not only will she assist you in every way she can, she also is very informative and knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu. Kudos Kelsey! Now the food..OMG! So since it is Charlotte Restaurant Week 2015, I chose New South because it's menu was more conducive with my company's pallette..lol. The pork spring rolls were perfect and non greasy. They filled with smoky flavor and very juicy. The dipping sauce was sweet with a sneaky spice kick. There was a pickled red onion slaw that added the needed sour acidity. I had the fried green tomatoes. Since they pretty much taste the same anywhere, I did like the horseradish sauce that accompanied them. They were sliced perfectly so that you don't look like a salvage slurping the juices while chewing. Course 2 Exquisite Rainbow Trout seared to perfection and crispiness. It was paired with collard greens and a roasted pepper medley. My plate... the SUPER moistened meatloaf made with grass fed beef. Oh yeah, did I mention ALL OF THEIR INGREDIENTS COME FROM LOCAL FARMS?! OH YEAHHHHH! It's  like even if you wanted to cheat and wanted something fattening that you shouldn't.. it's still healthy and pretty much organic.. so no guilt! By the time dessert came, I was fat, full, and almost completely lazy! There was pound cake served with  homemade vanilla espresso ice cream and marinated peaches.. again OMG! Powdered Beignets...somebody loves me! Kelsey mentioned one more detail that just sent me over the edge.. COMPLIMENTARY  chocolate truffles! Look I know how this review must read however you HAVE to go and EXPERIENCE New South Kitchen. New South is the new twist in Southern Fare!",

Our waiter seemed to love his other tables around us, but was lackluster to us, possibly because we were college students and therefore he thought we were broke?! We were treated with utter disrespect and were basically ignored all night-drinks were never refilled, dishes were never cleared from the beginning, and it took at least 30 minutes after we were done eating to get our check. Thankfully a kind young waitress finally cleared our plates and gave us the bill, probably seeing that we had been waiting for so long. Never judge a book by its cover!!",

    "text": "I came in town for Charlotte Restaurant Week and was completely disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. After drooling over the pictures on the website, I was so excited to try this place. My friend and I were sat immediately, but were taken to a tiny tot table floating awkwardly in the middle of the dining room. We had to ask the hostess to move us to one of the other six empty tables where we wouldn't feel like we were on display.   Our server, let's call him Grumps because he never actually introduced himself to us, automatically assumed that we wanted the preset menu without asking. He missed an opportunity to introduce us to the regular menu, did not inquire if we wanted cocktails, or anything outside of the complimentary red or white. He acted as if it was a chore to serve us, and kept this attitude up all evening.  Now on to the food. To start my friend had the fried green tomatoes, bland is a great description for this, in fact bland could be used to describe everything we ate except for the pork belly and one dessert. For entrees we had the pan fried chicken and the shrimp and grits. The chicken was the better entree, as the shrimp had no seasoning at all. For dessert, we had the pound cake and beignets. The pound cake was probably the best thing we had all night, the beignets were more like hot fried balls of dough-more akin to a hush puppy or blob of funnel cake than a beignet.   Grumps continued to make us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I hate that I wasted an opportunity to eat at a great restaurant by eating at New South Kitchen.",

I've been living in the South for thirteen years now, and as a Northern transplant, I've come to appreciate that not all Southern cooking means meatloaf and mac n' cheese. I had my suspicions that New South would be the kind of place that would try an upscale approach to Southern comfort food, which often times takes the \"comfort\" out of the dish.  New South does exactly that, blend an upscale approach with a respect for traditional Southern cooking. And it left me pleasantly surprised.   Take their fried green tomatoes, for example. A fairly standard dish, yet in their capable hands, a delectible, savory starter that had me sopping up the crumbs with their homemade bread. I say this with no reservation: Best Fried Green Tomatoes Ever!  The shrimp and grits also left me pleasantly surprised. Instead of what we've come to expect, a dish that's often left floating in a mass of gooey cream sauce, the chef tempers the dish in a delicious light mushroom sauce, thich enough to give the grits that consistency the dish needs. I thoroughly enjoyed this new approach to a classic dish.    The dessert, a dish of fried blueberry pie coupled with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream, was to die for. The perfect ending to a surprising dinner.  I'm looking forward to dining at New South again.",

The goat cheese was good, but about the size of a super ball you get in a vending machine....  Next...the bread and butter came out...I love bread and butter...this I did not love.  It wasn't 'just ok', or a non-factor....it was horrible..if that is even possible for bread.  Usually you can just salvage the crust, or just drench it with butter, but not this time.  It was kind of like eating compressed dust...  For dinner, we got the KT's Penne, which was very delicious.  The sauce was unique and fresh tasting with some good bacon mixed throughout.  They should bottle it up....why not?  Overall, the service was great and the food (except the bread...wow) was good.",

I also got an appetizer of their deviled eggs. They also were very tasty - my favorite one was with bacon. If you're near the Arboretum give this place a chance. I don't think that you will be disappointed. I've lived in Charlotte for 10 years and can't believe that I'd never dined here before. I will be back and try some more options. The time that I was visiting they had a limited menu. But, I was told that they also have a more extensive menu at later times. I was also told they have a brunch.",

Biggest star was the grilled pound cake with blackberries. It was awesome. Service was good too. We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "I would really give 4.5 stars on this one. The only reason I can't give 5 is because they have a patio in front however they were not staffed to serve on the patio on a Saturday night, with great weather. We did have the option to sit outside but service could have been really slow.   Now, on the very positive side. Let me start with our server, Mike. He was very attentive and very personable!  We had my 1 year old granddaughter with us and when he noticed we didn't have the kids menu he made suggestions.    We shared small plates--grilled romaine salad, fried green tomatoes, pulled pork spring rolls, and pork belly.  They were all amazing and couldn't pick one favorite.   At the end of the meal Mike made mention that since we obviously liked wine that they offer 1/2 price wine by the glass on Sunday and 1/2 price bottles on Tuesdays.",

Not only is the food delicious it is also all local which is very important to me. Of course this means it's a little pricier but trust me, it's well worth it.   The wait staff has always been pleasant! The bartenders are super knowledgeable about the menu and make a delicious cucumber cooler. Try out New South - you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Ahh... the South.  As a girl from the Appalachian Mountain culture, southern food is in my blood.  When a restaurant claims they're putting a new spin on what I often consider perfection, I'm often skeptical.  New South, however, knows what they're doing.  I had lunch here with three other friends a few days before Christmas.  The menu isn't huge, but it had a nice variety.  I saw several things I would like to go back to try.  This day, somehow the fried chicken dish was calling our names.  All four of us ordered it!    To start we had the fried green tomatoes.  I've lived my entire life in the south and can say with total confidence, these were THE BEST fried green tomatoes I've ever had!  They were simply perfect!  Our chicken entree was equally good.  The breading was a little crunchy, the gravy was amazing, and the mashed potatoes were silky and creamy.  I tried the brussel sprouts with mine and loved them.    We enjoyed good service, yummy bread and we all felt the prices were good, too.  Check out this great little gem at the Arboretum.  For me, New South is a new favorite.",

    "text": "Overall view of this place: \"It was just meh! ... you could do better\" -- Read more to know why:  I've been to this place three times now. I know ... what is wrong with me? I've given this place \"two stars\" and have been there three times. You'd think I would have learned my lesson the first two times.  Each time I go there, I find myself saying in my head, \"Well maybe if I got this, my meal would be better ... or maybe my pallet is off today.\" The thing is ... it's not my taste buds or the dish I got, it's the chef. The food is just ok. Sorry but it's True.  On the bright side the decor is really cute. It's well lit and very \"shabby chic\" with cast iron skillets hanging inside rustic wood picture frames. You really want to like the place.   I bought one of those \"entertainment books\" ... you know, the books that the neighborhood kid sells for their church or band club at school. The book had a coupon for this place so we were like, \"what the heck ... let's try New South out.\"  The first time I went for lunch, well more like brunch, since it's was around 11:45ish and it was the weekend. I got the \"florentine omelet\". It consists of: 3 egg omelet with spinach, mushrooms, onions & goat cheese topped with creole sauce -- served with pan fried potatoes or grits (I got the potatoes)  The thing with this dish was, the goat cheese over powered the entire meal. It was like I was eating a plate of goat cheese with a side of everything else. Not good ... not good at all.  The next time I went with my gal pal who had \"yet another coupon\" from the entertainment book. This time I decided to order a fail safe plan ... the \"New South Burger\". This consisted of: a beef burger topped with house made pimento & cheese, smoked bacon, lettuce & tomato.   Again with the heavy hand on cheese. Yuck ... and I LOVE cheese.  Also, the burger was a bit dry and I didn't ask for it overly well done on anything. So that really should have not happened. It's like the cook squeezed out all the juices. It was \"just ok\" again.  AND then the last and final time I went there, it was for dinner with my dad and husband. We were super starving and figured the Arboretum shopping center is close so why not give this place another try. \"You know cause third times a charm and all that jazz.\" Well don't believe that saying for a minute because it a down right lie.    I mean the menu seems so creative. It should work, right? Wrong. The execution is just NOT done correctly. My dad got the Monday special of the night \"fried chicken with buttermilk biscuits and gravy\". His review of the meal was that, \"it was alright\" ... with a shake of the hand.   Both my husband and I got the \"cornmeal dusted flounder\" served with caramelized autumn veggies, local greens and lemon butter. It was \"bleck\" Spell that word out and you'll understand what it means. B-L-E-C-K ... Yuck.   The server suggested it. I was torn between the 1/2 roasted chicken and that. The waiter said go with the flounder so I did. Boy was he wrong. The fish was mushy and the veggies were vinegary to the point of no return. It was not good at all.   Also, geeze louise. We had the hands down \"worst service\" that night. It was like our server quit or something. BUT HE DIDN'T ... he was just MIA and the manager or owner or whomever he was ended up waiting on the majority of the time. It's was a big confusing mess.   I'd really like to rave about this place. I LOVE FOOD and really enjoy giving good reviews ... but if it's not good I'm not going to pretend it was. I eat for pleasure ... my mom's a chef and I know food. This place is just not up to snuff. Womp, womp!",

Went for brunch a few weeks ago, and was impressed.  The brioche french toast was flavorful, light, and fluffy.  The mini muffins I ordered on the side came out warm, and were a great serving of totally unnecessary additional carbs.  As was the biscuit that I ordered.  For $0.50 for a muffin or biscuit, why not?  My girlfriend got the eggs benedict - definitely not traditional, as it was served with pulled pork instead of ham, and on top of grit cakes, instead of English muffins.  The red potatoes side was perfectly cooked, as well.  Girlfriend couldn't finish all of the potatoes, so what the hell, more carbs for brunch!  They still have a great beer selection - all but one draft was from a Charlotte brewery, and the final draft was from another NC brewery.  In fact, each Charlotte distributing-brewery (Four Friends, NoDa, OMB, Birdsong) was represented.",

We find the nightly specials to be very worthwhile: Fried chicken on Mondays, St Louis ribs on Wednesdays, and deep fried turkey on Sundays have all been good. The wine list is good as well, and they have beer and wine specials at various times of the week (see their website for details).  We have had one or two nights where the service wasn't the best and one night when the food really wasn't done as requested, or even well. The nights with poor service, I have no idea if this was the fault of the server or the kitchen, but they aren't charging Denny's prices and I do expect better follow-through than we had those nights. For that reason, the fourth star remains to be awarded.  But we'll go back, hoping to have a night that gives us reason to award it.",

    "text": "I went during Queen's Feast which is like a Restaurant Week.  The menu consists of a wine, 2 apps, entree, and dessert - all for $30.  I thought the deal was too good to pass up, since ordering just an entree + salad would've came to about the same price.  The entree choices didn't have what I came for (flank steak), so I picked the meatloaf.  The dish came with potatoes, which is the most tasty I've had.  Instead of mashing everything, the cubes still kept a bit of their shape and had lots of flavor (probably thanks to bacon fat).    As for the meatloaf, I was not a fan.  The consistency was like over-processed mystery meat.    As for the 2 apps, the fried green tomatoes (my first time eating this) sounded better than it really is.... it's like eating a fried cornmeal crust with bland tomatoes inside.  The grilled salad was very good though.... the lettuce leaves have a nice charred / smoke flavor.   My dessert which is the bread pudding with ice cream was a bit too sweat.  The ice cream was tasty but too sweet and I felt ice crystals in it (maybe that's natural for homemade ice cream?).  It would've helped to get a spoon with it which wasn't provided.  The portion size was pretty small.  Not that I could've eaten more after the other courses, but if this is the same size as a normal order, then I'd probably be disappointed.  Overall the price was reasonable, and the waitress was very friendly.",

You get three big pieces, more than you can eat at one sitting, but since it was overdone you didn't want to bring leftovers home.  Along with the chicken was mashed potatoes and gravy and some really nice green beans -- the beans were the best part of the plate.  Salads were pretty standard fare.   For a place that emphasizes organic ingredients something didn't quite come together. It's a tad pricey and the dishes sound better on the menu than they taste in actuality. Nothing wrong, but nothing to get sparked about.  Ended the meal with beignets and a dipping sauce. Should have been a happy indulgent end to the meal, but like all the other dishes, will be damned with faint praise.",

    "text": "Serendipity blessed us with finding this gem in a strip mall.  We actually tried to visit another place across the parking lot and they couldn't seat us. Thank goodness for that.  As a Manhattanite visiting Charlotte I felt right at home with the decor, the food, the presentation, the menu and the bar.  You could literally plop this place down in mid-town Manhattan, and aside from having to double the prices, you'd be good to go.  The restaurant's name, \"New South,\" describes the concept with the food.  They offer southern favorites that have had the benefit of the diligent application of the collective knowledge and skill of modern restaurant artistry.  Favorites like Mac and Cheese, Deviled Eggs, Pimento Cheese, Meatloaf, Shrimp with Grits, and Fried Okra shimmy into a little black dress and get ready for a chic-chic little West Village party in your mouth.   The deviled eggs were served with pork confit, the mac and cheese had a nice toasty top, the roasted fingerlings were savory and creamy.  They have daily specials and a surprisingly complete prix fixe for $25.  I recommend New South as a place to take your friends who usually turn up their noses at restaurants in suburban strip malls.",

We got small plates for our meal and shared between the two of us. We left feeling hungry and like we wasted our money.   Deviled eggs-Too mustardy for my liking Pulled pork egg rolls- The favorite at the table. Not bad but not worth the price Grilled romaine- bad version of a caesar salad. It didn't have a good taste. BBQ Shrimp- my favorite they were pretty good, but barely luke warm Fried green tomatoes- bland breading, disappointing sauce  It was a complete miss for me and my boyfriend. I do not think we will make it back.",

For main course had shrimp and grits which were phenomenal, and did not lack salt at all as mentioned by another yelper. Also had the special, braised short ribs on a bed of grits..so moist it melted in your mouth! Kids menu had fried turkey with mashed potatoes and green beans, meat was moist and green beans crispy.  For drinks had the Moscow mule, which was served in a  mason jar not a copper mug no mint on side. It was disappointing, would not order again. The kids lemonade was delicious, not Minute Maid crap. The iced tea was ok, but nothing to write home about.  Overall we would visit again if in the area, food was very good and fresh.",

The salads are made from local lettuce- which always makes a HUGE  difference. House made dressings. Also, The desserts are made in house and can't be beaten. Homemade ice cream. Pound cake is delish!  Good selection of drinks and wines. I have a weakness for their fried okra, pulled pork sandwich and the fried green tomatoes. YUMM!!!",

I had the grilled chicken wrap with fries and my husband ordered the New South burger.  The wrap was good but the burger was excellent. The burger was one of the best I have had in Charlotte - it is topped with pimento cheese and bacon.  The waiter told me the buns were made in house by the chef.  The fries were perfectly salted.  They also give complimentary homemade biscuits - I wish they served these with something other than regular butter but they were pretty good.  We will for sure be back and next time I'm getting the burger!",

    "text": "Visited on a Saturday, a little after 5:30 pm. I was with my husband and two kids. The restaurant was pretty empty since it wasn't dinner time yet. The hostess asked if I had a reservation, which I replied no. She made a sigh and said she will see what she can do and stared down at her paper for a very long time. After waiting a while, I walked over to the dining area and there was only one couple sitting down , all other tables and booths were completely empty. I kindly let her know the dining room was empty to which she responded \"those are all reserved, I'm still looking to see if we can seat you\". She finally said she found a spot and sat us at a table. At this point I told my husband I didn't even want to eat there anymore due to her bad attitude but he told me to give them a chance; luckily our waiter was the complete opposite of the hostess and was very pleasant. We had the BBQ burger, chicken and waffles, and Mac n cheese.... everything was phenomenal. Service time was also great, we were in/out in less than an hour. Additionally when we left, there were still over 8 tables/booths empty. I'm not sure what the hostess' issue was but I'm glad I did not let her bad attitude drive us away from a great meal.",

Fresh ingredients, home made recipes, and truly fine food.   The entrees were fantastic - Of the three I tasted the Pork Loin was simply to die for!   But honestly, I could of made a meal just of of the appetizers!   Smoked Trout Spread was best fish spread I have ever had!   Crispy Pork Belly was good, but man oh man - the accompanying garnishment which consisted of \"warm butternut squash & pecan salad, orange glaze\" made this appetizer on of the most flavorful dishes I have had in years! truly a \"wow\" dish!   The Pimento Cheese spread was 100% homemade but, to my taste, the pimentos were a  bit more spicy than I like.   I will 100% go back again as this is my new favorite local restaurant in Charlotte!",

The waiter came over fairly timely, but started off fairly surly. He wouldn't make a recommendation. Then as we perused the menu, he disappeared for nearly 15 minutes. When he finally came back we ordered the New York strip and the butternut squash salad. The salad came out fairly quickly, and was tasty. We then proceeded to wait for over 20 minutes for our steak. The steak, which was supposed to be 10.5 ounces, was no more than 8, had not been trimmed so the grill had curled all the fat, and the steak was clearly medium, not medium rare as we had ordered. It was not well seasoned. The brussels sprouts, which were supposed to be cooked with onion and bacon, had neither onion nor bacon, and only about half of them were cooked. The waiter came back and checked once or twice while we were eating, but was hardly warm and fuzzy, and made no effort to make things right for our long wait. (By the time we received our steak, we had been in the restaurant for over an hour.) All said, a disappointing date night...",

The food was dynamite, and all (except the Brie) from a short menu they use during weird hours like Sunday afternoon before dinner.  So many places are CLOSED during this time, so I applaud them for being open.  Our server was great, too!  Enjoyed sitting outside in the nice weather, wish it was more ambient than an active shopping center parking lot.  Maybe some iron railing would help?  Plants?  Sadly, we saved no room for dessert - the choices sure sounded good.  We've already made a plan to return!",

I went online and looked to see if reservations were available (it was a Saturday night) and they looked pretty open, so we drove the 10 minutes over to the restaurant. After arrival, there was 1 party seated in the dining room at 6:45. We were told there were no tables available except for a high top at the bar. The table was awkward to dine at as it was much too small for 4 people, and once we left there were more than half of the tables in the restaurant still empty. I guess if you have the option definitely make the reservation. Our waitress was fine, but not extraordinary. Everyone's dishes were plated beautifully but were kind of meh. My trout wasn't seasoned well, my husband's meatloaf was dry, and everyone else was meh about their dishes. The sides were pretty tasty. But overall, after this experience I don't think I'll be back. Especially since Cajun dog is so close and soooo good. I think we just felt like we weren't welcome or appreciated the whole time we were there.",

    "text": "I found new south kitchen on restaurant week. I was very excited heard some good things so 4 of went. Their appetizer started with pimento cheese spread with pita bread an pork spring roll an crispy potato salad an fried green tomatoes. I loved the fried green tomatoes an pork roll were delish. The pimento cheese had red peppers too hot for me. The crispy potato salad was pieces of potato n corn an not sure what else an a poached egg on top.  That was not a hit at our table. For entrees we ordered the pork belly with collards an fried chicken with smashed potatoes an string beans an the shrimp and grits with gravy. The pork belly my friend said was perfectly cooked moist an great flavor the collards were not as good. The shrimp and grits were perfect shrimp cooked just right n grits very smooth and creamy perfect dish. The fried chicken breast was disappointing , first I smelled something an realize as I'm eating my chicken they Burnt the breading on the chicken. It was 2 chicken Brest a lot of foodi should have sent it back but I was hungry so I took the breading off. My friend said they could see it was burnt that should have never come out of the kitchen . My mashed potatoes were good but very little gravy I didn't wanna ask for more since I was already charged .50 for an extra biscuit .  If I'm at showmars or McDonalds n I want another sauce it's .25 fine I expect that but not at a very nice restaurant . Your cost should be in each entree already. So for desert we had the grilled buttermilk pound cake with vanilla ice cream an black berries . It was okay I was thinking they would just have a few grilled marks on the cake which would make it warm n add the ice cream to melt that would have been so good. No they had a sugary taste so I assume they put either sugar water or sprinkled sugar than grilled it maybe but it was too sugary for pound cake. My dad makes homemade pound cakes they are to die for . We also tried the pecan bread pudding now that was good moist not over cooked an more pecans would have been nice. I wish I could give them a 5 but a 3 is the best I can do. I would only wanna go back for some appetizers :)",

I had The fried turkey with cranberries and stuffing dressing and collard greens.   My husband had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and fresh green  beans.  Both were very good however I'm partial to turkey. The homemade biscuits were very good but unfortunately you get no refills. Otherwise I would've up my rating by an extra star. Would also be a great choice for vegetarians.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner the weekend before Christmas with my aunt.  We made reservations through open table and even got an email confirmation.  When we got there, they had no record of our reservation, so we had to sit at a high top table in the bar.  No big deal, but there are reasons why you make reservations.  We started off with the deviled eggs and and pimento cheese wontons.  Both were good, but the wontons were not cheesy or what I expected, just had a pimento cheese decorative sauce line on the plate rather than on or in the wontons.  Also kind of pricey when you only get three.  For dinner we ordered the chicken and waffles, pork chop and pork shoulder and split three sides - squash, succotash, and mac and cheese.  The chicken and waffles were good, but I've had better.  The jalapeno jelly was too spicy and I like spicy foods.  The pork chop was okay, but loved the pork shoulder!!  The sides were just okay to me, nothing outstanding and pretty pricey for the small amount you get on one plate.  Would we be back?  Sure, but it won't be my first thought.",

Of course everything turned out beautifully.  Our reception was rather large with 150 people which naturally had me overwhelmed but the management, service and quality of food was perfect and put all my wedding worries at ease. Working with Chef Chris Edwards and his wife Sue (who put together the service end) were so helpful with the planning, the choices for our menu, keeping our menu within our budget, and allowing our day fall in perfect sync with our timeline.  If you are looking for a catering service for an event that not only has delicious food, but also an amazing staff ...this is one to look into! We were very happy with our decision.",

    "text": "New South's menu is made surrounding seasonal ingredients from the Carolinas. They take pride in supporting family owned farms that use sustainable, all natural farming methods. They make sure the beef, pork and poultry they acquire are raised with no antibiotics or artificial growth hormones, and they make sure their seafood is sustainably fished or farmed in Carolina waters. They even have a gluten free menu!   New South is most known for their deviled egg appetizer. This comes with 2 eggs of each: traditional, bacon, and pickle stuffing. Their yolk stuffing is unique in that you can taste a kick of mustard! I also recommend their other popular appetizer, the Pork Belly. This dish consists of pork belly cubes on top of sweet potato and pecan salad, and an orange glaze. The Pork Loin is arguable the best entree on the menu. A nice sized filet of pork is laid on top of baked mac and cheese, collards, bbq jus, and topped with apple chutney. The sauce on here -- sweet apple with a hint of spice -- really makes the dish!",

I like the comfortable seating and decor, both inside and out. At this point I've sampled over half the menu and everything was really good...I think you could order just about anything here and do well for yourself.   Additionally, prices are reasonable and portion sizes are good. There are some ways in which they could potentially liven up their menu, make it a bit more exciting, but there's something to be said in New South's reliability in terms of taste and freshness.   Of note, I have never had a salad w/ croutons keep so well (as leftovers) until I took home New South's roasted romaine salad in a doggy bag. I saved this salad (w/ it's house made croutons) for lunch the next day fully expecting to end up throwing a soggy mess into our chicken coop as a midday treat for our chooks. Instead I was met with a salad that was just as good as it had been the night before...croutons and romaine were still totally fresh and crunchy/crispy! I'm not sure how this particular salad accomplished what I'd previously assumed to be impossible...I've attempted this same feat for about 25 years now with no luck. To me, this little leftovers coup is a testament to freshness of the ingredients that this restaurant uses!",

There's enough  room for my plate to fit on the table- and also all my notebooks and meeting essentials. The staff has always greeted us, offered us info on the daily specials. Their beef is grass fed, and the burgers are amazing (they accommodate  me with bread free dishes- and never seem surprised or dismayed when I ask). Their side dishes are great portions and scrumptious!! Loved their roasted Brussels sprouts. They also are conscious of our meeting discussion, and have perfected when to ask us a question \"how is your food today\"? Or \"would you like more water\"? in a way that is not disruptive to our conversations. This is a great atmosphere, a little slow to receive food- but perfect for a business lunch or to catch up with an old friend.",

Our services was slow too, but we didn't mind as we had a larger group and were enjoying our conversation.  For the starter I had fried green tomatoes. I have never had fried green tomatoes before so I have nothing to compare it to. The tomatoes were hard but tasty and the breading on it wasn't too much. It was definitely lacking in salt and I am not one to ever put salt on my food. My girlfriend that also order the tomatoes and has had them a lot said they weren't that great.  My entree was crab cakes and mac and cheese. The crab cakes were good, but again, I have had better. I did like that they served it with a mustard sauce instead of the remoulde. The mac and cheese was great. It had a few crunchy pieces which I always love and the cheese made it nice and thick.  The dessert was by far my favorite. It was a piece of chocolate mousse cake with raspberries. There is nothing better in this world than chocolate and raspberries.  Overall it was OK food and I may go back again to give it a second chance.",

The style is modern southern. Classy, but not stuffy. Our server was prompt and pleasant and reviewed the specials with us. I opted for the pork cutlets with bacon and tomato jam. I ordered a side of collard greens to go with.  While waiting fresh biscuits and whipped butter was served. They were light, fluffy, and delicious. I could have been happy with a basket of biscuits for my meal.   The cutlets arrived next, and they looked wonderful. Two thin cutlets were stacked and topped with mushrooms, diced country ham, bacon and tomato jam, and a thin brown gravy. The dish looked wonderful, and tasted even better. The pork was cooked perfectly. The bacon and tomato jam was so savory and made a nice addition to the pork. My side of collard greens was perfect too. They were seasoned very well and didn't need any extra salt, pepper, or vinegar. They were soft but firm, not mushy.   I will definitely return to New South Kitchen & Bar. Their menu has lots of items I'd like to try. I give this one 5 stars y'all.",

Food choices ok. we ordered: make your own omelet with grits, shrimp and grits and chicken salad on a bed of salad plus a cup of muddled seafood chowder, plus biscuits on the table. Food plated nicely, good portions, came out hot. Biscuits very tasty, my seafood chowder great flavor hardly any seafood or fish in it. Basically $4 for a cup of liquid. My  pesto chicken salad tasty but not exceptional. My lunch mates enjoyed their food and said food was very tasty. I would return and try something else. So far not overly impressed.",

It was covered in a gravy that sounded delicious but also lacked flavor. The eggs were cooked well but also no seasoning. It was just a really bland meal.  My server seemed like he was in way over his head. He would ask how things were going as he passed with out a pause to wait for an answer. The couple at the next table received salads that were not dressed. He made excuses rather than admit a mistake.   I have been here for dinner and loved it. I will be back, probably not for a brunch.",

The service was good. The ambiance was good, the restaurant needs so fixing up seems to have taken a beating in the short time it has been around and the benches need to be re-filled or something, they just are not as comfortable.  The only thing that is preventing me in providing 5 stars is the above everything is very good, nothing screams I can not get this somewhere else. Nothing special menu wise, that I can not get or have seen somewhere else.  I Do recommend them because they are very good.",

From the creaminess of the yolk to the saltiness of the gravy. The combination was outstanding. I wanted more! Toques off to the chef!",

I would recommend getting the chicken and waffles - it's delicious! The kids meals are larger portions so 2 kids could split one meal. I had some macaroni and cheese and it was so yummy!  It's a really cute restaurant too - nothing too fancy but not super casual.  They have a wide variety of local beers too. Be sure to check it out if you're in the area!",

The only thing I would say they could do better is having the biscuits come out warm but that is just a personal preference.  As for dinner I had the bacon, egg and cheese burger.  It was cooked perfect.  The bacon tomato jam was very good and the bun was soft and toasted just right. My daughter had the grilled cheese (She started eating before I could get a picture) which she enjoyed very much.  Also her side of fruit was a good fruit cup with strawberry's and grapes.  None of that melon filler fruit no one eats.  My wife had the pot roast with grits for a side.  Everyone was very nice and it had a great atmosphere.  We will be back again soon. Well I spoke too soon.  We ended up with the apple cobbler desert and it was awesome.  It took 8 minutes because it comes out fresh and it was perfect.",

Everything I read sounded good and I've have similar dishes before. I was expecting a new twist on southern cuisine but I'm not going to harp on the name. The ambience is similar to a fast casual chain and outdated. Once you order they bring you biscuits. One per person . So we had two for the table. The food was overly salty and we didn't finish. The service was good but that's about it. We were excited to try this place because it does have good reviews but we won't be going back",

While waiting for my friends, I ordered the Charleston Mule. I learned that the liquor used in the mule came from Charleston. It was satisfying as I sipped on my drink and waited 20 minutes for their arrival. I ordered the butternut squash salad and I was not disappointed. It was absolutely delicious. This was a meal for me as I didn't eat that much. One of my friends took a chance on one of the specials - the scallops. The other friend thought they were going to be too tough and chewy but when we tried them, they were cooked perfect and just melted in our mouths - delicious! My 2nd friend came a little late and ordered the soup and devil eggs (6). She said the soup was wonderful and her eggs were good. I thought I would have room for dessert, but by the time I ate most of my salad and half of a biscuit our waitress bought, I was too full! Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She helped us select our meals based on our questions and taste. I love this restaurant and will definitely be back when I'm in town!",

I had the herb baked chicken with fried okra and mashed potatoes. Although tasty, the mashed potatoes tasted as if they came out of the box. This was disappointing because this \"soul food\" restaurant harps on their home style food. However, our waiter was awesome. Very attentive, and relatable. Why I give this restaurant 2 stars are the atmosphere and vibe I experienced. My friend and I were the only African American couple there, and quickly felt it as the restaurant stared at us the entire visit. Particularly, the table across from us where a man stared at me and my friend the ENTIRE VISIT. Needless to say, it will be our last visit due to the uncomfortable vibe we experienced!

    "text": "Updated 3/2012.  Charlotte now has many good restaurants but I find that after a few years I tire of my current favorite place and move on; this has not happened at New South. Their food at dinner is always good and nobody in Charlotte makes better vegetables; they have a dinner special for $25 or $30 that includes a glass of wine and dessert you can't beat that price for the quality of food that they deliver. That is one kitchen that delivers above their price level. Best breakfast in Charlotte! I have always liked this restaurant for dinner as their kitchen delivers at a much higher level then their prices but this morning I tried their breakfast   for the first time and it is outstanding, plus reasonable. I had my standard American breakfast of eggs, meat, potatoes (as good as they get), biscuit. Even the small fruit salad on the side, which normally I push to the edge of my plate, was five stars and I could have eaten a bowl full. The menu also covered your standard brunch fare but I will let someone else review that as I will stick to my American blue collar breakfast. You will find my American pickup truck parked in front on any given Saturday morning while I enjoy the best breakfast in town. On Sunday their wines by the glass are half price, so that is where I have my dinner on every Sunday. They are open daily but only on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast/brunch. Enjoy.",

    "text": "The wife and I decided to go out to eat during these rough economic times - we had a B1G1 free citypass coupon for New South, which we'd seen whenever we went to the Arboretum shopping complex.   Got inside for the very first time...  place is sparsley filled and decorated - like a college kid without enough furniture and hardly anything on the wall.  Maybe it was just that the place was mostly empty?  The fake candlelights on the table seemed like a cheap touch.  I figured out why the place was empty with the first glance of the menu. Everything was just a bit too expensive.  Entrees do not include salad, and then the salads cost 7 dollars on their own...   I'm not avocating that the world needs more more more, but having a mostly-empty table most of the time doesn't give a great gastronomical experience.  I ended up with a beef ravioli dish that was delicious at $17.  The portion was small in the \"I know better than you\" kind of way.   Wife had the pork dish at $19.  It was good but not great.  The pork itself didn't have a ton of flavor but the accoutrements added to it just fine. Again, the portion was small.  We ended up with the roasted banana with ice cream and rum cake.  The cake and ice cream were very good, the banana was nice, and again, the portion was small for a 7-dollar dessert.  I see that I've said the word \"small\" a number of times. I left the place feeling that I could have eaten a bit more to be satisified.  I usually prefer some nice greens with my meal, but everything was so expensive.  Really, not extremely expensive, but $7-9 dollars for some lettuce and dressing?  That's really pushing my buttons, especially since the world is in turmoil.  Wait service was good not great.  I wanted the waitress to stop long enough to talk to her about why the restaurant was so empty at 8pm on a Friday night but she always quickly moving.  I guess that's just somebody being efficient.  To wrap this up - the food was good but over priced. The place was empty-feeling.  The table was empty-feeling. The waitress was swiftly moving. I really don't know how this place has stayed open so long.  I wonder if Dakota's (the same restaurant in the same place with the same owner that closed to change names ) had the same problem.  Now that we've experienced New South, we'll stick with the Down Under for our future dining needs.",

    "text": "The food at this restaurant is amazing!  Everything my husband and I had exceeded our expectations.  It was very fresh and I love how they use locally sourced ingredients and grass fed beef.  Their sustainable fish from NC comes in fresh daily.  It is too bad that this restaurant is not somewhere like Ballantyne with more space.  The food is so good but the restaurant is so small and kind of hidden at the Arboretum.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the lack of friendliness of the staff.  The nicest person we had contact with was Lauren but we were disappointed by the rest of the staff.  They seem to all be rather curt, not at all personable and just lack customer service.  For the caliber of food they should have service more like the server we had at Vivace.  That server took the time to welcome us, go over the menu and specials, make recommendations and was extremely courteous.  The food as I said was some of the best I've had in Charlotte.  Probably the only place comparable is Customshop.  The service is just not inviting and didn't wow us.  If they could get some more space and train their staff on customer service or hire new people they would do really well.  Give it a try.  The food is worth it!  I want to go back for breakfast and lunch.  i just wish I could help them in the areas where they are weak.  I would love to see a restaurant like this have multiple locations.  It is so hard to find fresh food, made from scratch, without all kinds of junk, processed ingredients.",

    "text": "We were excited to try this restaurant for brunch as a friend recommended it, although she hadn't been there in a while, which might explain things, I'm not certain if something changed in between when she went and when we went, but, we didn't have a very pleasant experience. We went here on Easter Sunday after church and walked to the hostess stand to inquire of a table. There was one family of 4 waiting in that area, no one else. We were asked if we had a reservation and we said no, we did not. We were then informed, quite rudely, that the only place they could seat us was outside on the front patio facing the parking lot. I turned around and looked again at the family of 4 and thought to myself, that's interesting, it isn't like you have a long wait or anything, and if THEY were sitting there waiting for an interior table then THEY must have had a reservation from what the hostess just told us. Okay, we said, seat us outside, A bit chilly that day, but not really an issue for our party of 3. Service by our waiter was EXCELLENT, for having to go in and out so many times through the front doors and his friendliness and professionalism. He gets 5 stars. The food and the hostesses, not so much. I ordered a huevos rancheros and first off, the portion was that of less than a child's plate. Oh well, I though, keeps my caloric intake in check I guess. The eggs were completely overcooked, the salsa nearly non-existent, a few teensy pieces of cilantro tossed on and the \"tortilla strips\" were tossed on as an afterthought. The plate was served messy, zero appeal whatsoever. The potatoes underneath were totally overcooked and burnt. My daughter had a pasta dish that was oversauced and the chicken overcooked in it. My better half had hash and eggs, with his eggs also overcooked and the hash was really only cubed potatoes like mine were, and overdone. A final note on the \"reservations\" needed, we noted that maybe, just maybe, a total of 5-6 families go inside when we were there, 2 of those families seated outside in the same patio area as we were. Going inside to use the restroom and taking a quick peek at the dining room, it was only 3/4 full, plenty of space to have put us at a table. Now that's frustrating. We won't be back.",

When it has not been fully cooked it makes the meat tough and hard to eat. I was disappointed. I had such high expectations for this place. My husband ordered shrimp and grits which turned out nice. Tastes good......but we most likely will not return. I think that for upscale southern food....Mert's is still the reining champs. If you want a relaxed meal in a normal environment try LaWans on south tryon. They throw down in there!!!",

Sure it's in a strip mall (the Arboretum) and therefore faces the parking lot, but if you don't like the view, just face the other way!  New South features upscale southern food. Pricing is good and I'm really digging their draft beer selections and drink specials. I went there Saturday night and had some really delicious locally-brewed beer for $3 a pint!  I also had one of the entree specials: The \"local\" flounder (local? how local? whatever!) on top of herbed spaetzle mixed with delicious little pieces of sweet potato and spinach. I got my beta carotene and I didn't even feel like I was eating vegetables! My husband had the American Kobe beef, (they said it was Kobe-style but raised here) which was also yummy.  Cooked just right.  The service is always friendly and I love the fact that I can get a nice cozy table without a reservation (usually). We really love to go there in the winter, because it's kind of dark in there (more difficult to see the parking lot) and a good glass of cabernet and a warm meal just feels comforting.",

The restaurant week deal was great, I believe we got something like 4 courses and a free glass of wine for around $30. Everything we ordered was delicious.

Which the couple that had went there for lunch, said the buffet was limited and that it was not over the top like she had anticipated. Maybe sounds like they need to change out menus for lunch and brunch.  I have only ever went there for dinner. It has always been awesome. We have tried most of the items on the menu. Starting on the kid's menu, the mac & cheese is awesome. It is completely homemade and delicious. The appetizers from Fried Green Tomatoes, Cheese plate and Redneck Cheese board our all wonderful. The grilled romaine salad is another favorite. We have the rotisserie chicken, the pork, and typically get the veggie plate that is served with only what' s best in season and the freshest. There desserts are tasty too and they have half priced wine tues for an extra bonus. Check this place out as I can only promise you that your dinner will be a delight, cute little classy southern joint. Enjoy!",

So as we did, you might THINK that the menu selection will be a little bigger but it's NOT!!! My mom and I actually got 1 thing from each category except \"sandwiches\". As my starter I had the \"exotic mushrooms\" which had NO taste! That was ok because unlike others I can appreciate the natural taste of foods but this was going a little far. Then we had \"soup & salad\"-Arugula & Brunswick Stew. The soup was OK but the salad only had oil as the dressing so it tasted like NOTHING. Then we got our entree...I had the shrimp & grits with sausage and my mom tried the crab cakes with grits and green beans. I tasted her food first and I was immediately turned off! The grits were tasteless and so were the crabcakes. Atleast the green beans had great texture! LOL! My cheese grits were tasteless as well, along with the shrimp. The gravy and the sausage had flavor but not enough to compensate for the rest of the dish. I have NEVER said any food didn't taste like anything but this was a FIRST. I know how to add flavor without salt and I don't think they do. There was no onion, garlic, herb or spice in those dishes. LOL I will NEVER go back unless a person dear to my heart BEGS me to go with them & even then I will not pay for my own food!",

The food was tremendous, our server was really good and we got something we don't find a lot of in restaurants - value.  Started with the deviled eggs and they are a must.  6 halves, 2 of each kind - regular, pickle and bacon. MMM.  I had the crawfish bisque and this is the reason for the 1/2 star off.  Taste was really solid, but it was a little thin for a bisque and there were no chunks of crawfish in it.  Not a one.  For dinner, my daughter had a burger.  I tried a bite and it was tremendous.  Someone put on a review of this place that the burgers were the best around.  Not sure if they are the best, but they are really up there.  I had shrimp and grits which were great, even though they were in a brown gravy.  Wife is dairy free and they were so accommodating to make the braised short ribs without the dairy.  Killer good, be they are off the chart if you get them made the regular way.  Last but absolutely not least was dessert - fried blueberry pie!  Are you kidding me?  think of a hostess pie from when you were a kid, deep fry it, sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top and oh yeah, lop a scoop of some of the best vanilla ice cream on it.  OYE!!!  First time there, definitely not the last.",

    "text": "I've tried to think of a better way to put it, but in short New South.. confused me. Looking at the menu online prepped me for one type of restaurant (maybe something along the lines of Bask), upon entering to the bar area and the array of printed booth cushions and four tops I immediately got a more family feel... not a bad thing, the casual setting was comfortable and welcoming. Then, our server arrived wearing jeans and a tshirt with chuck taylors (okay this is a little more casual than I expected) and then we received our water in beer-labeled pint glasses. I understand the concept of bringing an upscale and contemporary cuisine to the masses, I just think there is a way to do it without making me feel like I'm in three restaurants at once.   But, onto the food. Our server was pretty quick to let us know the pulled pork spring rolls were about to be 86'd, so if we wanted them we should jump on that. They had sounded good, so we grabbed an order. We then ordered the swordfish and the shrimp and grits. The rolls arrived, and I couldn't accept the contrast in consistencies. It was a perfect fried shell, but the inside was such a mushy pulled pork filling it was an odd mouth feel. The sauce was nice, kind of a thinned out and spiced up sweet thai chili sauce.   The swordfish was extremely pungent. I hadn't ordered swordfish in a while but I felt like the pieces could have coated the corner of the room in fishiness. Smell aside, it tasted great, and the ham vinaigrette was a nice touch. Really the whole dish was great as long as you avoided the cucumber slaw. The shrimp and grits had great components, but together didn't hold much in the flavor department.  Overall attentive service, water glasses always filled, and the food had some good flavors. Also, really nice portion size on the big plates. I think when they release a new menu I'll try them again, but they aren't currently on my charlotte top restaurants list. And they are located along the curve of the strip with Le Peep, not towards the Taco Bell/Walmart area.",

Went with a total of 5 people, two of the guys didn't even go prix fixe.  And the bill was still respectable.  We went on a Tuesday I think, and it was 1/2 price wine bottles as well. We decided to go family style on the apps.  Fried green tomatoes, a meatball flatbread, a tuna spread, \"redneck\" cheese board (pimento haha), and mussels.  They were all delicious.  If I had to rank them, hmm I'd have to say flatbread, tuna, tomatoes, mussels, cheese. For entrees, one guy got the pork tenderloin.  2 of us got the baked chicken off the prix fixe, and the other 2 got the roast chicken from the regular menu.  The house wine was not bad, a bit sweet for cabernet, and the shiraz we got was peppery.   Then we got dessert, we also kinda split up between bananas/rumcake, butterscotch bread pudding, chocolate mousse, and a lemon tart.  Damn, it was a nice surprise and pretty good.  We'll definitely be back.  Oh yeah, the decor is kinda cool, like almost homey, but still modern enough to have a few flat screens at the bar.  I would describe this place as kind of a classy southern place, but not over the top.",

    "text": "I wanted to love New South.  I *still* want to love New South.  Alas... meh.  Located in the back section of the Arboretum with most of the restaurants (right next to Le Peep, and if you hit the car place, you've gone too far), the parking lot appears to have been designed by Helen Keller - but the Arbo parking has been a wreck for 20+ years.  I was greeted immediately by the friendly hostess and quickly seated.  The chair did not find my fat ass to be a fun way to spend the evening and creaked every time I moved.   It's embarrassing to be sitting by yourself in the middle of a restaurant talking to a wooden chair, pleading with it not to splinter.  Nice, simple interior, I liked the framed pictures on the wall.  There was a wall-length cabinet full of wine.  The table closest to me seemed to have regulars at it, which is typically a good sign, though with my early arrival time of 5:45, there were only a couple of other tables seated.    The menu was a simple 1 legal sized sheet of paper with a handful of choices for cheeses/charcuterie, small plates, salads, sandwiches and entrees.  I had checked out the menu online, so I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting already.    The food: A basket containing two thick slices of warm bread with soft butter was brought to the table.  The bread was good, nothing special or unusual, but warm and tasty.  I am not sure if the butter was a flavored butter, but I didn't like the taste.  I ate the bread plain. Pork belly sliders:  I have never had pork belly sliders, though they are on every non-chain menu in Charlotte.  I was told by a friend that it is sort of like BBQ.  It is most assuredly *nothing* like BBQ.  It seems that I like every part of the pig except for the belly (how can something so close to the bacon be so NOT bacon?!).  It was unpleasant for me, but that is a matter of my taste and not the execution of the dish - they very well could be delicious for what they are, but I have nothing to judge them by and I plan on never intentionally eating pork belly ever again.  Not ever.   Pan fried chicken:  Pan fried chicken is usually a little darker than deep fried, so I was expecting it to be a little more done than something the Colonel dishes up. Two small breasts, pan fried, served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a smidge of gravy with a layer of collard greens.  Chicken was tasty, crust stayed on the chicken for the most part, mashed potatoes were creamy, but nothing magical, gravy was sparse, collard greens were well flavored with only the slightest vinegary hint.  Plated well, but zzzzzzzzz  My server rattled off some desserts for me that all sounded wonderful, included a fried blueberry pie (hello!), but I was ready to call it a night.  My waitress was friendly and efficient and when I made a face at the almost full plate of sliders when she picked it up, I admitted to her that pork belly was not what I thought it was.  When I was through with my meal and she brought the check, without me asking she had taken the sliders off.  I asked that she please not do that, as it was my fault for not knowing what it was, but she said it was taken care of.  Excellent customer service - so I feel even worse about not being wowed.  I am guessing the gentleman circulating checking on everyone was the owner, he was very pleasant and was making sure everyone was happy.   All of the staff was wonderful.    I want to go back and maybe try another dish, I really did enjoy the restaurant itself and the employees were a delight.  I might need to return just to try the fried blueberry pie and then update my review.",

    "text": "Four stars for lunch, five stars for brunch. Ive enjoyed every dish Ive had here but the reason that I rate New South slighty lower for lunch is that the small plates are a bit overpriced which is unfortunate since the small plates are actually better than the big entrees. I love making a meal of a few small plates for he variety-I sometimes get taste fatigue-but at New South, the prices make that hard to do.   Now that Ive gotten the negative out of the way, Ill go to the positive and talk about my favorite dishes. The pulled pork spring rolls are excellent. Sometimes pork is dry and tasteless but the pork here is tender and bursting with flavor and that already excellent flavor is enhanced by the sweet chili sauce that it's served with. When I go for small plates, I usually get the spring rolls and the fried green tomatoes. My favorite entree is the pecan crusted trout. I adore nut encrusted fish since the nuts give it texture and crunch without having to deep fry. This dish seems to be prepared slightly differently everytime I go but its always awesome. Ive had it topped with lemon butter sauce and Ive also had it topped with tabasco aoili. The veggies that are offered as side dishes are always super fresh since they come from local farms but since side dishes are five dollars a piece (!!!), i only eat them when they come with my entree  Brunch is more affordable than lunch and the dishes remain great. I like to start my brunch by ordering a basket of muffins (you can also buy an individual muffin for 50 cents if you dont have a big group though they dont advertise this on the menu). They rotate the muffin flavors and the coffee cake ones are devine. The stand out brunch dish is the Southern eggs benedict. This dish consists of grit cakes topped with pulled pork, eggs, and Hollandaise sauce. The combination of flavors is amazing-I dont usually go for egg dishes because eggs are so plain tasting but the combination of the eggs, the juicy pork, and the lemony Hollandaise is supremely enjoyable. This dish also allows me to enjoy the same delicious pork that is in the aforementioned spring rolls in a dish thats much more filling and substantial. Charlotte has a lot of great brunch places but I think New South has the best.",

    "text": "We went there for lunch right after it opened. Considering the reviews and the price, I was expecting more than a booth with a paper menu. Anyways, the waitress had an opinion (always weird to hear them say they don't like something!) and we ordered the chicken plate and the deep friend turkey plate.  They brought out a cinnamon and sugar muffin and a biscuit. If these things were warmed I would've cancelled the order and just eaten these. That biscuit with a little butter and the blackberry jam they provides? Best thing there. Nice to see a local business provided the jams, too. So the turkey was....ok. Deep frying didn't do anything for it, I think. Two of the pieces were so dried out that I couldn't cut them. The cornbread stuffing was not to my liking but that's probably because cornbread stuffing isn't the way I prefer my stuffing so don't judge it by that if you like it. There was no cranberry sauce (really? With a turkey plate?) or mashed potatoes - which turned out to be a good thing. My partner's chicken was pretty basic. Smallish chicken cutlets, fried, over mashed potatoes and services with haricot verts. They called them thin green beans for the people who don't know French food terms. It was all....ok. Except when I tried the mashed potatoes and realized they were INSTANT. We all know what instant potatoes taste a like. A $13 lunch plate with 2 small cutlets, some, ahem, thin green beans and a scoop of mashed and you couldn't give REAL potatoes? That's unforgivable. I should've gotten some with my turkey but I'm glad I didn't.  All in all, with 2 sodas, it was $31. I can think of about 20 places to spend that kind of money on lunch and get something tastier - starting with my favorite pizza place. Ice hears they do a great dinner and I see them on the a Restaurant Week list. It seems like a fool of the dice for me. I might skip further visits. All because of those mashed potatoes.",

He changes the menu often to reflect the best of what is available.  Whatever you order will be prepared carefully and presented artfully.   The staff is very friendly and professional.  They know the food and can help you order just the right meal.  Just the right blend of being attentive and being out of the way.  New South Kitchen is our favorite place to take out of town guests.

    "text": "Traditional southern \"meat-and-three\" meets everything fine dining has to offer at the corner of Pineville Matthews and Providence Road. I would be reaching to find one thing wrong with the overall experience my wife and I had last night at New South Kitchen.   Prompt service in a casual atmosphere set the tone for the night. Our server was on point the whole time, from the time she took drink orders to the bill presentation. When she came to take our dinner order, I had 3 menu items picked, and they all sounded so good I was prepared to order all three. However, our server was able to present and sell the chef's special (soft shell crab) so effectively I went with one of those instead. I love a server who can knowledgeably sell her chef's inspirations. And I was rewarded for my choice with two soft shell crabs that were fried to perfection and so big the legs were hanging off the plate! Fantastic.   I recommend the grilled romaine salad as a starter. Their flank steak was amazing as well...it's very easy to turn flank steak into a piece of rubber...but this flank steak was tender and juicy. Substitute the roasted sweet potatoes for the grits...alot of places frown on substitutions, but this place is more than happy to accommodate. Also, they have daily rotating specials...sort of an homage to the southern country kitchens of old.   Wait...I remember now...there was one thing wrong with the overall experience. There was a hole in the booth's seat. Do I care about the hole? No.  Go to New South and have a great, Southern-fried experience.",

I had the veggie plate with squash (zucchini and yellow a little chunky but good), mac n cheese (penne and velveta-esq) and collard greens ( they were great. not too bitter I like the vinegar approach)  my dining buddy had the fried chicken. It was flavorful and tender. The mashed potatoes were homemade and the green beans were not cooked to death.... The bread was bland and not warm as others have stated. Both big and small plates were Delish...   The service sucked. When we first entered we were told that a table needed to be prepared. The hostess walks away and comes back. We were seated next to a fly inhabited window. Which was more so annoying than disgusting.... Ok it was actually both. We weren't up sold on wine or cocktails even tea. We were given the pitcher of water and that was it.  We ordered our small plates and then we were asked if he wanted to take our menus. Do ppl only order small plates here? We want to eat its 7:00 in the evening... After a bit of observing I realized that the tables are already preset and there were only about 5 other taken tables. Why we had to wait for a table to be put together? I'm not sure. We heard about the snapper special and soup of the day from the same server seating the table behind us.  Boooooooo Scott... I'll try again with a different dining buddy on a busier day and see if anything changes. For now you get 3 stars and that is because the food was delicious.  #MaybeNextTime",

Brave and bold and organic and fresh. My pork chop was cooked perfect and perfectly paired with its sides of cream corn and kale and pink lady field peas. This is a perfect date place  craft beers bustling bar and a nice moody atmosphere. Leave the kids at home for this one although they have a kid menu that is nicely priced it is not where their strength lies.

    "text": "So I'm hanging out with my good friend, and he says to me 'Last night me and Suzanne went up to New South and had a half off bottle of wine and fried blueberry pie.\"   \"Excuse me, what's that now? You had what now? You said fried something...\"  \"Blueberry pie...\"  And so began my desire to dine at New South. Now I know what you're thinking: \"Oh I can't wait to hear what he says about the blueberry pie!\". Well stranger, I disappoint, because when I got there, the dessert offering had items on it even BETTER than aforementioned fried blueberry pie. I should have written down what they were called. I can only describe what I had as \"Banana wizardry\". It was a decadent, light, fluffy, syrupy banana (and rum?) cake with ice cream, reminiscent of bananas foster. Divine without being overly sweet.   We also had a full meal before that, of which I requested a surprise vegetarian meal since they weren't heavy on the vegetarian selections. Now, my theory on asking for a surprise is that it should instill in the chef a sense of adventure and a break in their routine. This was the result here. I received a wonderful mixture of items that were sides on the menu along with new creations. Each were distinct in their flavors and pleasing to the palette. Everyone's meal was great, including a big juicy burger and a salmon dish with big fluffy corn cakes.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, funny, and helpful. I'm the type to harass waitresses playfully, and she handled my idiocracy with grace and humor. The manager also made appearances at our and other tables to check on things, which I appreciate.  Bravo to this fine place.",

However, I would probably give it only 3.5 stars because on several visits, the service has really been been hit or miss.  (This visit was so-so, but last time, we had great service).    Overall, the food is good, but the major limiting factor for me is that they put bacon in almost everything here, which really limits my choices. (Ok folks, we get that this is \"Southern cuisine\" but really, give us a break with the pork already!)    But, on the upside, they have a nice wine list.   Tonight we had the B.R. Cohn Cabernet Sauvignon which was a beautifully balanced wine. David decided to have a burger and the creamed corn.  I tasted his corn and it was flavorful but not at all creamy.  I would have been disappointed if I had chosen this side dish.  Usually I order the trout or whatever fish is on the menu at the time. However, on this visit,  I went for the daily special which was deep fried turkey  breast served with dressing (studded with cranberries) and fresh green beans on the side. (This dish normally comes with \"Southern beans\" which is cooked with bacon but they substituted the fresh green beans since they are not cooked with bacon.)    They are also now serving brunch on Sat & Sun - since brunch is one of our favorite meals on the weekend,  we'll definitely be back to check that out!",

The beer taps and bottles were solid as they offered some craft beers along with your typical domestic staples.  Back to the salad.  This is where I was a bit let down.  I mean I loved the Okra but the food just didn't have any personality.  I know I sound like a brat saying that but with a dish that unique I kind of expected it to be, well, unique.  It was basically a cobb salad - sans egg - with fried okra on top.  Meh.",

    "text": "I was excited to finally try this place since it's so close to my house in the Arboretum in South Charlotte. My husband & I are ready to check out some new places & are using Restaurant Week as the perfect excuse to experiment.  We don't dine out all that often, so when we do & when we plan to drop more than $10 on a meal, I want to be impressed. I want to really enjoy my time & my food. Alas, that was not the case at New South Kitchen.  First of all, we were completely overdressed. I had scolded my husband for wanting to wear shorts to dinner, but now realize his preferred attire would have been much more appropriate for this surprisingly casual place. Most of the workers were wearing jeans & tshirts. And the other guests were equally casual.  Bread - It's not often I turn down carbs. But this bread had no flavor. A flavored butter might have helped, but there was nothing to save this pre-dinner snack. Fried green tomatoes & salad - both were decent. Generous portion of tomatoes with a sauce that had some zip. Deviled eggs - would not order these again. The ones with pickles were the best since it added flavor to an otherwise bland appetizer. I also prefer my deviled egg mixture to be smooth. They use ground mustard in theirs, which I didn't care for. Meatloaf - the hi-lite of the meal! I'd go back for this. Very moist. Very flavorful. Pork - this was my husband's entree. Tasted good but had more fat than he wants in lean protein. Grilled pound cake & chocolate mousse - both were ok but not worth the extra calories in my opinion. We preferred the chocolate option over the pound cake, which the server recommended & raved about.   Speaking of our server... ugh! Very loud. Too over-the-top. Used the same ridiculous lines with every table while taking orders, bringing the food, and collecting the check. Instead of trying to be Mister Funny, he should have been paying attention to our water glasses that were empty and we had to ask for refills twice. The manager doing the \"table visits\" barely approached our table, as he breezed by several tables at once asking us all if everything was ok. I didn't get the sense he was actually interested in a response, but rather just checking our table off his list for the hour.  Lastly, the thing that really was a bummer about our evening was the flies. Yes, flies! I expect that when I dine on a patio, but when I'm inside eating in a nicer restaurant, I don't want to have to keep shoo-ing bugs away from my food. If this is what we were experiencing in the dining room, it makes you wonder what the kitchen is like. Not good. Not good at all.",

    "text": "We decided to stop in here on a recent Friday night after doing some shopping it was around 8:15pm and most of the other places in the Arboretum had quite long lines.  We walked right in to no lines and a half empty bar area.  We were greeted almost immediately and were told it would be a few minutes.  It was a little weird as the host walked away and kind of left us just standing there for about 10 minutes.  When we looked around about 25-30% of the tables were empty so we weren't sure why we were waiting but, I digress.  We decided to get 3 small plates and split an entree.  We got the fried oysters, Pimento Cheese, and fried green tomatoes for our small plates and then the catfish entree, to spilt.  The server asked if we'd like the food to come out in any particular order and we said no.  I thought is was really awesome of her to ask that.  Her service was excellent, seriously, it was excellent.  She asked all the right questions, checked in on us at the right time, just fantastic.  Anyway, our 3 small plates came out.  The best thing of the 3 was the pimento cheese as it was the only thing with any flavor.  The fried green tomatoes were very bland, i had to smother them in the sauce it came with.  Would not get those again. Fried Oysters again, were bland.  i guess it's maybe a lot to ask to get flavorful shellfish this far inland.  We smeared the pimento cheese on the tomatoes and oysters just to give it some flavor.  we finished the small plates and then the cat fish was brought out.  The cat fish was good, but again, very bland. It came with a sauce that you had to smother the fish in to get any kind of flavor.  The grit cakes were just ok and my boyfriend commented that the Brussels sprouts weren't as good as the one's I make at home.    Long story short, while the service of the waitstaff was excellent, the host/hostess needs to manage things better and the for the price the food just isn't worth it.  75% of our food was flavorless and bland, though it came quickly and was piping hot.  I don't think we will be returning unless the food improves.",

    "text": "I just want to start off by saying this place is amazing!!!! We stopped here by chance because our normal brunch place had a long wait time and we saw New South has $3 mimosa! Winner!!  I had the chicken and waffles with a side of mac and cheese. The chicken was tender and juicy and full of flavor! The waffle was the best waffle I've had in a long time! It was so delicious paired with the syrup and homemade butter. The Mac and cheese didn't disappoint either! I was very pleased with my plate.  I also nibbled on everyone else's plate. My friend ordered a bacon, cheese & onion omelette. It was a nice portion and very flavorful and cheesy. That also came with potato wedges seasoned with sea salt -which were very tasty! My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken that came with his choice of 2 sides; mashed potatoes and collard greens. I tasted both and of course it was delicious!!   Overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant, the prices aren't bad, the food is fresh (& did I mention LOCAL?!!). I will definitely be coming back to try dinner. Brunch was a hit!!",

    "text": "Went there for lunch for the first time and this place is a hard pass. The server opened with explaining that they were farm to table, everything was local and fresh. We ordered the grilled ham and cheese with fruit for our one year old son, which turned out to be Kraft/processed cheese with cubes of ham on pita bread, not grilled but looked and felt like it was microwaved to just melt the cheese. The fruit was large chunks of unripened pineapple, nothing else. I asked if they had any other fruit as the pineapple was hard to bite through. The server came back and told us the chef said they have limited berries so it would be a $1.50 upcharge. Paying extra for ripe fruit - hardly what you think of with farm to table (along with processed cheese product for that matter). I ordered the soft shell crab benedict special and my husband ordered the meatloaf. Both came out cold. My husband did like the flavor of his. Mine was very bland even with extra salt. I also asked for no tomato on my benedict but it came with two tomato slices. The server was nice but didn't notice or ask about me not eating my meal. Their biscuits were good so I'll give two stars but there are plenty of other decent to good places nearby...no need to try this place.",

We ordered an omelet and egg rolls and it took thirty minutes for our food and we were the only two in the restaurant. And let's not talk about the mixed drinks. Will never go back.",
