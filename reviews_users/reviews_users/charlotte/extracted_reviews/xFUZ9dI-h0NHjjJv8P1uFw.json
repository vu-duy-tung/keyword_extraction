The sauce was really good and it was a nice way to \"think out of the box\" so to speak with pizza.  The only thing missing for this dining experience were TV sets and a better bar selection.  Having a variety of alcohol available and TV sets on would make Wolfman a real go-to place for having food and fun.  The staff members were friendly and gave top-notch service.  Giving them more fun options available with the bar and TV viewing would really help them shine.",

Great regular pizza but poor service and a dangerous error. Just a heads up since they offer a GF menu.",

    "text": "Happy Holidays!  I know it's been a while since I've wrote but it is the holidays &amp; I've stayed very busy with them.  Hope everyone had a great holiday as I did.    So let's talk about a pizzeria I ate at during the holidays...Wolfman Pizza at Quail Corners on Park Road.  At first look, it looked like a small, empty place as I walked by to do a little shopping.  But when I walked inside, it was actually full; the seating can't be seen as the booths are further in and tall.  Luckily a booth was empty, even though I was by myself, I need my space :)  The place is small but they do make the most of it.  With a few tables up front, several large booths, and even bar style seating with a great view of the pizzas being cooked.    A family friendly place, on this night, you saw a variety of people from elders, to young kids, to the high school/college crowd.   The menu is unique, printed on a newspaper, with a variety of pizza toppings.  \"The Laboratory\" section of the menu allows you to create your own unique pie from the sauce, to the crust, to the variety of cheeses.  Want a Black Bean sauce pie with Bleu Cheese &amp; Bean Sprouts...it's yours here!  Since it was my veggie day, I tried the White Wolf pizza.  The 10 in pizza arrived & was delish!  Garlic butter, New York style crust, with mozzarella/parmesan/Swiss cheeses, topped with Roma tomatoes minus the basil!  The size was just right, though I couldn't finish it.  One thing I didn't care for was all the oil...it was everywhere.  A little paper napkin to soak it up & I was good.  The cheese was oozing everywhere...the way I like it .  On tap, local beers which I think is great!  I enjoyed a nice NoDa ale, a little darker than I expected but still good. $ is good too...I recommend you try if you're a pizza lover!",

Ive also had the wings which i didnt like... they r baked, but i got buffalo with barely any buffalo sauce so if u like them saucy ask for extra! and personally the wings werent cooked enough for me, they should go about it a different way. noone likes soggy wings. but overall, great place, great pizza, awesome on delivery too!",

They don't have much counter space, and anyone who had longer hair was just wearing a baseball cap, so that didn't seem very sanitary. Now about the pizzas.. We got the cheeseburger and a veggie. Cheeseburger actually tasted like a cheeseburger, and it seemed like there was mustard and other cheeseburger seasonings in the sauce!! Didn't even try the veggie, just filled up on cheeseburger.

    "text": "This Wolfman location was my first, hopefully of many, visits to the small chain. I'm so accustomed to the pizza/bar setup with good food, kitschy interior, massive TVs with ESPN streaming and an overt amount of sprinting youths. This location feels more like a quick service pizza joint with service at the tables, draught beer, and an open kitchen.   Made it in for a late Sunday lunch and had a great time. Cozy booths line the wall, big cushy stools at the bar, and fun decor abounds. We grabbed a big booth for the two of us. The menu is printed like a newspaper and makes for a memorable read-through. Tons of sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, and all of the usual suspects for apps. We started with some \"Styx.\" Breadsticks with sundried tomato pesto, marinara, and creamy artichoke dip. All dips were spot on, the sticks were seasoned heavily, but balanced, and they certainly didn't last long. 6 comes in an order and is a perfect serving for two.   Our server was very gracious with our vegan order, too. We ordered the veggie pizza with no cheese and also a buffalo chicken....with no chicken or the typical cheeses. Nothing of note for the meat-eater/dairy-lover, but was rather fulfilling for us. It's rather pleasant to visit a restaurant that doesn't balk at a diet-specific order and is rather generous with the time and consideration. Very humbling. The crust is fantastic and I'd imagine is equally notable for other pies.   Prices are fair and definitely worth their weight. I'm looking forward to visiting this location or one of the others around town soon. Cheers, Wolfman!",

Since I do not Read Menus well they gave me a \"Silver Bulletine\"  Newspaper about Happenings with Warewoofs!  If you are a Warewoof someone is hunting you and I would watch it!  OK this was mostly a Menu which was harder to understand than the other kind and maybe I'm not real good at reading anythinj other than Pictures and some GREAT Reviews on yelp, the ones written by Friends (someones Friends, right).  You KNOW I LOVE YOU!!!  Who ever though of \"Build Your Own\" must have known someone like me... Except I usually have CHEESE, Tomato Sauce and Crust... If a plain Cheese Pizza is Good, then......  Since I have eaten this Pizza in other places I knew it was good...  Fresh Basil (turned out Crunchy, still very Good) Red Onion, Sausage, Normal Pizza Sauce (just like I remember and Very Good)... Until last night It has been years since I have had a PIE for the Woofman.  Dessert...Hummmm, How do I word this?  S'mores Pizza... Before I say Two and a Half yelp stars, I'll call it a Poor Dessert to Bare the name S'mores!!!  NOTE to the Owners***  On this Dessert and on your Dessert one person is saying right here...\"Go back to the Drawing Board\" or, OR Ignore me... I'll still eat your Pizza and go somewhere else for Dessert!  I'm NOT mad... This is a NOTE to help YOU! Woof!  I'll go somewhere and learn to use spellject!  Appetizers? Hummm... Last Night I was HUNGRY and really wanted something, Appetizer or two before the Pizza... Instead of making a second note to the owners, I'll ask someone else to make some CREATIVE and Delicius Pre-Meal options, ideas so the Woofman can eat the competition, not that he could not anyway (being a Woof)... Pretzels come to mind!  Thinly Sliced ONION Rings like the Cow Fish Onion Straws.... Something from a Great Horror Movie or an Idea for the Next Horror Movie to come out in the Spring!  Woof... these are the clues: \"Hot\" Sweet Potato Chips (NOT reheated - Made-to-order) or Zoo-kini (Zucchini) Chips (like at Nolen Kitchen) or how about Bacon Wrapped, Sausage Stuffed Jalapenos with Bacon Marmalade Dipping Sauce!!!  Very Good Service!  Most of the Servers are VERY Good with Children...They took GREAT Care of me!!!   No Way this is a Sports Bar, right? ? ?  Place looks GREAT...Like Chucky Cheese for Adults with a lot of kids too!  Warewoofs photos aretalt over this placet... Serious about the Woofs!  Warhol or Warholesk Woofman Art!  I LIKE it A lot!  Ricciocho ask me to catch a Coyote pup so he could \"Raise it as a Dog\"... I told him \"It does NOT work that way\"!",

    "text": "I really like the changes and new location within the shopping center. Seriously delicious pizzas and good service. Much smaller space than the original, but I like that it's not so \"sports bar\" oriented. A few booths, some bar seating, and a more modern interior. When we went, it had only been open a few days, so they were working out some kinks. I hope that the patrons of the previous location flock back in.   Back when I was eating meat, I remember loving the Cheeseburger Cheeseburger pizza. So good. The salads are also top notch. I saw a couple of local beers on draught...always something I appreciate.  All in all, for good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere, this place wins. I hope they do well in the new space!",

The food is so good, the menu is unique but also has the typical staples that you want when visiting a pizza place. Service is always spot on at all Wolfman locations we have been to.   On a mom note- they have high chairs available with straps that are not broken! They have a kids menu (pizza, panini or pasta options) but at 5.99 we choose to share with our two year old rather than to get him his own plate.  The servers were friendly with our kiddo but could work on making sure they don't put hot plates or full drinks within his arms reach.    We will definitely be back again and again!!",

    "text": "Like most of the other reviewers, I'd say this is a pretty solid, horror movie and Wolfman themed pizza place. I've never eaten at this location but have ordered delivery from it what must be 50 times. Service is quick and the guy who usually comes is super cool and brings the pizzas inside for us. Best options are the Veg o Matic (the vegetarian pizza), and the white wolf. A couple things have bothered me about this place for years. The basic pizza sauce is unusual in a bad way. I usually sub the ricotta sauce. They have no concept of extra cheese - if you like a lot of mozzarella, this place is not for you. They steadfastly skimp on cheese even if you order extra cheese. Once I called and ordered extra cheese and they insisted it wasn't necessary because they used a lot of cheese to begin with. Not so - these pizzas are light on cheese. And my third problem is that, much of the time, the people who answer the phone to take orders when you call are not particularly friendly. Still, this is our family's go-to pizza delivery because it is one of only two higher end places that deliver to our neighborhood (the other is Rusty Onion, which I prefer because it is more NY style and has more cheese, but my wife and kids hate), and it is consistent and quite good. Expensive though!",

I love buffalo and spicy things don't normally bother me but this was hot. So hot that your mouth burns for a solid 20 minutes after eating.  The food was really fresh.

Literally, the entire top was covered. After putting the pizza in the over to crisp the soggy crust, it did taste okay, but so so greasy. The beer specials looked great, and maybe eating in provides a higher quality pie, but I don't think i'll be back for pizza. $3 beers are worth it, though.",

We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and only one waitress was working, so the wait was slow when it came to refills on drinks or if you asked for additional sauce on the side. Overall unique ambience, ok service and really good pizza.",

He devoured it. :-0  I got the Thai Chicken... from their menu... Asian chili, diced chicken, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, scallions, bean sprouts and homemade Thai sauce. garnished with cilantro.  It was an unusual combination of flavors on a pizza but it worked.  Staff was friendly as well.",

We started off with an order of the Styx with marinara, sun-dried tomato pesto, and cheesey artichoke as our sauces. The sticks themselves were just ok. They lacked flavor. The marinara was also just ok. The pesto was very good and the cheesy artichoke was definitely our favorite.   For our meal, we split a 16\" pizza. We got half Thai Chicken and half White Wolf with sausage added. The Thai Chicken was delicious. Our waiter recommended the White Wolf, but we didn't like it very much. It didn't have much flavor at all.   If you're looking for a good pizza place with unique flavors, I'd definitely recommend coming here!",

    "text": "Today, I was going to be a really good boy. I was going to pull into Quail Corners Shopping Center to check out the Ilios Noches restaurant there. I was going to get a NO GUILT salad.   But when I pulled into the lot, I spotted WOLFMAN PIZZA.  The good intentions went out the window.   I loved Wolfman the very minute I walked thru the door.  It was visually alluring and the booths and bar stools were inviting!  I was a little sad that I was alone today, as it would have been charming to share the atmosphere and share a pizza.  So, I thought that I would order a 10 inch veg-0-matic pizza and eat half of it.  Surely, my hard working other half at home would enjoy the uneaten half for dinner,   Well, that's not how it worked out. I scarfed down the entire thing and had to order another one to bring home!  That crust was PERFECT.  It was really perfect!  Not too thin and not too thick. Perfect. The veggies and toppings could not have been better. I rarely eat pizza cause I am at the age when every bite goes to the mid-section. Oink oink oink.  Today was my once year splurge and SPLURGE I did!  Great service.  Cozy little atmosphere.   Couldn't have been better in any size, shape, form, or crust.",

    "text": "Wolfman Pizza is one of those underrated spots in a not-really neighborhood that just cranks out consistent, quality pizza. The Lady and I used to live right next to here and every time we find ourselves back around our stomping grounds, gosh darn it I can't resist the allure of the Wolf.   If you've never stopped by here, the whole place is werewolf themed. You'd be surprised at just how many werewolf movies there are. You sit down and the menus are these newspaper-esque folds where the story on the front is a satirical story about werewolf, you open the menu and most menu items are wolf themed... they do a great job of theming. All themes aside, I wouldn't give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the food. My personal favorites are the Thai Chicken Pizza and the BBQ Chicken, but sometimes I stray.. like this last time, I got the Big Bad Wolf. Point is, you can't go wrong here. Sometimes The Lady and I order their breadsticks with dipping sauces (don't miss out on the cheesy artichoke dip or the sundried tomato pesto). And I don't think I've ever had a bad or even sub-par experience here! Wolfmans will ALWAYS have a special place in my heart and stomach. And fridge.   As a closer, another draw is the small array of local beers - they have specials on Tuesdays where any draft is $3. Where else can you get that?!?",

Didn't know if we had to wait and put our name on the list or what but there were several others waiting. I finally gave them our name and saw there were 3 other groups ahead of us. Since it was just me and my husband, they told us they had a two top ready for us. I saw on the list that a group ahead of us was also a party of 2. I asked them if that party shouldn't have it first and they were super confused. That party of 2 ended up taking it but if it wasn't for me, we would of gotten sat before them which wouldn't of been fair. Other that that the food was good.",

For eat-in or take-out, this place is still one of my favorites for personal pizza.  As a vegetarian, my two favorites are the Bella (Lugosi) and the Veg-o-matic. The Bella has an Alfredo base rather than a red sauce and is so creamy and comforting... a mild flavor, but a great go-to. The veggie is nice if you're looking for a bit more punch in your pizza. It has a traditional red sauce and banana peppers. I've also had all of the other veggie pizzas and honestly, they are all good.  The service is great and the place has a small home-town restaurant vibe to it. There are probably about 4-5 booths and 4-5 tables so the staff is always nearby to refill your water or get you another beer. They also started recognizing us after we'd been a few times haha.  The beer menu is small but local, with usually 5-6 beers on tap at any given time. Some local staples and some more adventurous options are available. Plus, if you go on a Tuesday, they have $3 drafts!",
