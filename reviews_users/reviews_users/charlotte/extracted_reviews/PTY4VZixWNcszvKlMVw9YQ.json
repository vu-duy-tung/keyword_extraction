It looks and taste like the picture - when does that ever happen? Cause I  can't say the same for the chipotle ribs... The cookie though - best thing I ever ate.. At Chills. 2. Jacob, my waiter. He made my entire experience phenomenal! Again, when does that ever happen? Rare. I'd go back for those two things alone! Next time you go, ask for Jacob and tell'em I sent ya ;)",

    "text": "We were forced to stop somewhere for dinner when driving back home, and this happened to be the only chain on the side of the road. I'm just glad it was a Chili's since that is one of the few chains that I don't mind going to when the need arises.  We hopped in at around 7pm on a Sunday and were seated immediately. The waitress came right over to take our orders but seemed a bit sad that we didn't order alcoholic drinks. Sorry we were in the middle of a several hour car ride where drinking isn't the smartest idea!   My wife ordered the shrimp tacos and they were pretty tasty. The shrimp was cooked nicely so it had that little bit of firmness on the outside, and the sauce that it was served with was a good, and a tad spicy. I ordered the babyback ribs smoothered in their beer-infused bbq sauce. Chili's ribs are the best ribs I've ever had at a chain restaurant and these were no different. They were succulent and tender and down-right delicious. I also enjoyed the sauce which was sweet yet had a bit of a bite to it. I also had the mashed potatoes and they were nothing to right home about...just dry, tasteless lumps.   Is Chili's my ideal dinner location? Heck no, but it was the best option on that stretch of 74. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but if I ever find myself heading back home from the in-laws again and this place happens to come up around supper time, I won't hesitate to stop in again.",

The meat on them was over seasoned and had a lot of gristle.  The worst part is that they put a garlic butter sauce on the tacos.  I normally enjoy garlic, but why put it on tacos!!??  I used to really like the chilis chain but I feel like there food quality has plummeted.",

We did the two for twenty and had to send the chips and salsa back twice because they were both stale and cold. After nearly an hour of waiting for our food our waiter had forgotten about us. The manager brought out our main course and they were wrong. To top it all off the food was terribly undercooked. Once we finished \"eating\" it took another 15 minutes for someone to come by just so we could ask for our check. I usually enjoy my experience at Chilis but not this time. This was the absolute worst restaurant experience I have ever had. I recommend eating somewhere else when in the Matthews area.",

The rest of us get there and wait patiently for someone to come and take our drink order. We wait at least 15 minutes before a friend of mine gets up and starts asking random servers to send OUR SERVER to our table. Dude finally comes and takes our drink order.  We were so upset we made him go ahead and take our food order. It takes another 15 MINUTES for us to get our beverages!!! The service was just UNACCEPTABLE. We kept complaining and the manager came and personally apologized to us. He gave us a free cheese dip to try and calm the waters. Our food still took another 30 minutes to get to the table. I ordered the classic sirloin and requested it be cooked medium. When I got the sirloin it was WELL WELL DONE. Needless to say I was very upset. I took one bite and sent it back. The manager apologized and did not charge us for the plate. Not sure what was going on this night but the service was absolutely horrible. I have eaten here before but never experience such unpleasant service.",

I was enjoying a Saturday night at Chili's, in Matthews when the greeter of the restaurant came to the table and ask myself and the member of my party did we come to complain since the original drink I ordered for the bar was made with traditional margarita instead of mango margarita mix. First off I never complained in the first place my waiter got this issue taken care of in a timely manner and she was great. I stated I'm able to tell the difference between the 2 drinks, I was in the restaurant and had a wonderful experience by the waiter Ryan. The doorman during this evening was Larry and my experience was absolutely horrible today first off if he's the greeter he has no business being all the way back by the tables near the kitchen. He called me a bougie bitc* and said he doesn't care if I tell the manager of.",

I only mentioned my warm beer and how I also am a server so not being a pain and she came off as she didn't care and I was in the wrong.there was no consolation as an unhappy customer at all, had I not been a server and understood the business I would've made a complete scene.but the way I was treated even telling the manager that I was currently in the industry makes me feel like this establishment does not care about their customers and as long as they make enough to pay their cooks per hour they are <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fok.so&s=8cc93c8a745f85dec87ee2777f77a3ee95e5dd7eff1a2e36db222939e83609bd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ok.so</a> please if any type of upper management see this review I would love to speak to you and explain this situation, again based on my job being based on reviews",

Sat at the bar since NO ONE was in it and got great service from bartender. My first draught beer was a little warm, but the second was nice and cold! Kitchen took forever to get my order out with people coming in after me getting their food before. The fajitas where very good indeed after the wait. Since I got all you can eat, they give you progressively less so your stomach can catch up which is good cause the steak was very filling!  You really can never go wrong with these guys, but just keep in mind to pace yourself. Chips and salsa are always a good thing here to say the least!",

If the meat quality is good this shouldn't be an issue. I don't like medium well, which is why I ordered medium rare. It is stated on the menu that the burgers are served medium well.  Don't ask how we want it done if that's not a option and you are going to serve it the way you want, irrelevant of how we order. Service was good although another issue is if you're paying by credit card, we were told to swipe the card at the order machine on the table. Our server was good, but isn't that his job?   With order machine at the table and paying ourself, the wait staff is less attentive and drinks were slow to be refilled or reordered, oh wait we do that ourselves on the machine in the table.  Customer service is lacking, maybe I'm old fashioned, by why are we tipping if we are doing the ordering and paying ourselves?",

Went here on a Friday night and the hostess seemed a little lost and confused, but we managed to get a table right away (for 7pm).  I would call that early on a Friday, but still...  Our server came by and greeted us and took our orders.  Seemed like a lot of people were celebrating birthdays because we kept hearing the Chili's version of Happy Birthday being sung every 5 mins.  I guess that is why the food took forever to come out.  I wouldn't have minded, but I had the cajun pasta and it was.. okay - some of the pasta was overcooked.  Overall, not the best Chili's experience... maybe it was just a bad night.  This is one of those times where service really effected the food experience for me.",

We don't frequent Chilis a lot but this by far was the worst one food wise. We heard others complaining about cold beans as well. Their beer cooler was also broken and they had only two beers on draft. Unless I get another gift card here I won't go back.",

    "text": "This chilis is the absolute WORST. Please don't waste your time eating here. We come to this one because it's closest to our house. We tolerated the bad service just because it's somewhere close to eat with a variety of choices. The last handful of times we came here the service was bad, they skipped on portions and the food wasn't quality. But it's what happened during our last visit that we will not be back. We were sitting waiting for our food and about 3 of the staff workers were on the other side of our table talking, rolling up silverware and they were gossiping so loud. We couldn't even talk amongst ourselves because they were so loud. They would talk English and then switch to Spanish when they started talking about people (I'm guessing they were talking crap) and then they would switch back to English. It was so annoying and rude. Our waitress walked passed our table about 3 times before my husband had to wave her down for a refill.  We got our food and it was burnt and I wouldn't eat it. I waited about 5 minutes for the waitress to come back around, but she didn't even look at us. Eventually my husband asked one of the employees that have been gossiping for about 20 mins to get our waitress.  They took our food back to remake and it took them about 20 more minutes to bring it back out and it was STILL burnt. What really upset me was that the person that brought it out was a regular cook. It was no manager or anything. AND the cook didn't even say sorry or ask if she can get us anything. She literally dropped it off and ran off. And it was still burnt!! We waited for the waitress and again she never showed up, we had to track her down. We ended up just leaving. I have never have been so angry at a restaurant. I would give it a another chance, because I know stuff happens. But the couple times before that weren't the best and I'm done giving them more chances. Not to mention this place is DIRTY. One time we were there and they sat us and there was straw wrappers and stuff in the table from the last guest and the girl that sat us said \"do you want me to clean this up?\" ...... uhhh, shouldn't you have already done that??? Also, the floors are gross like they don't pick stuff up and it's slippery. If you want chilis that bad, drive to a different one. Or take it to go. But make sure it's not burnt.",

    "text": "Visited this location this past Saturday (10/27/18) around 9pm. The hostess was very pleasant and we were seated in a section between the bar and and some windows. There was a large party with a lot of young kids seated near us who looked like they'd been waiting awhile so we assumed that we had a wait in front of us as well. No big deal since it was a Saturday night and we didn't come for the gourmet service. I was also really excited about the local craft beer selection.   There was some type of silverware station on the other side of our booth where a female employee (looked around 16-17 years old) asked an older white male employee not to do something. (No idea what, I wasn't really paying attention.) The older white male instantly started yelling at her to mind her own business. She nicely asked him to calm down and he began a very loud, very whiny tirade including but not limited to \"fuck\" and \"bitch.\" She firmly told him not to curse so he did it some more as he walked away. (I will refer to him as \"whiny pants guy\" for the rest of this review.)   As the dust is settling our server shows up at our table to greet us and take our drink orders. (Roughly 15 minutes after being seated.) He was very personable and gave my partner some beer recommendations. As we're waiting for drinks that will never come we hear the female employee reporting what happened to a different older white dude. She's upset. He doesn't care and brushes her off because he's busy right now. We don't hear anything else for another 10 minutes and I assume that the situation was settled in the back. Two staff members show up in our section to speak to the large party that was seated near us.  They're not there to apologize for the behavior of whiny pants dude. They have run out of pasta and can't fill all of the orders for the table. (Not sure how long that party had been waiting. They must have ordered before we sat down and we had invested 25 minutes into our table.)   A few more drinkless minutes go by and our server walks by (with no drinks) talking with the girl from earlier telling her she shouldn't be starting things. My parter and I grab our stuff and leave.   I understand that the food industry is a stressful environment. I've seen 2 consenting Waffle House waitresses scream at each other across a restaurant at 2am. This was different. It was verbal abuse and blatant disrespect of an employee in front of young children.",

I wish we could have tipped her more. We got a good serving and greatly prepared hot and ready food, delish!! I loved the steak and shrimp fajita's dinner item. Our son loved his mushroom and swiss big burger combo with all the fresh toppings of a burger, tomatoes, lettuce, onions along with the sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese. The manager of the store I think his name was Clint was by far outstanding to hear any concerns and my steak on the fajitas was tender and easy to chew. Hey, our car battery died while sitting in to eat, it has been cold. So one of the waitresses let him borrow her truck to give us a good jump in the parking lot to send us even extra happy home!! I love this place and we look forward to coming back soon!! God Bless you guys!",

The quality of the food is very consistent, but there are two very important things that I look for when spending money at restaurants. First, the cleanliness of the restrooms! I believe that you can tell a lot about the management and employees when walking into the restroom! Ever use a Walmart restroom? That's how I felt tonight when I took my 4 year old to use the restroom and wash her hands before dinner. The restroom was disgusting! I'm not sure if the employees are responsible for cleaning the restrooms, or if they have an outside cleaning service, BUT I would highly recommend Enviro-Master! They specialize in restroom hygiene! They eliminate viruses, order causing bacteria and mold and mildew. To be honest I usually go to restaurants that are services by them! You'll notice a small sticker on the toilet that says \"sanitized by Enviro-Master.\" At that point, rest assured that you are safe! It's very important to protect your employees AND customers! Second, the SERVICE. Our server was very nice. Our experience would have been better if we were \"asked\" more often than we had to \"ask\", if that makes sense. I feel if I order an appetizer, I should have to ask for appetizer plates. As well as to go boxes, bag, check. Overall the food is good at this location, but as far as everything else, there's always room for improvements!!! If you know what I mean....",

The server/bartender, Stan?, was nice, but too busy to be all that attentive. Additionally, the couple at the table beside me both ordered some sort of shrimp and chicken pasta.

When he wasn't babysitting (yes babysitting a child so that a server could tend to her tables) he was very welcoming and attentive.   I saw one server carry a child which, as it happens belongs to her, as a restaurant professional this is absolutely a NO GO!! The man that I am assuming was the one in charge seemed to be more interested in playing around with the staff instead of running the restaurant.   I will not return to location.",

It took us about 15 extra minutes to pay because our waiter disappeared. On another note, our waiter super friendly and did a fine job. If you are expecting top of the notch food, this isn't where you are going to find it. But it's good when there aren't many options to choose from.",

    "text": "They still can't get a burger (or anything else for that matter) right. We went there on Friday night mainly for a Margarita, to tell the truth. My wife ordered a chicken dish, I don't trust their cooking but I figured they could at least get the burger right? I ordered the \"big, fat, juicy just bacon burger\" medium RARE. I told the waiter RARE 3 times!  A long long way long time later we get our food and my big fat juicy burger is flat, dry and very well done, I had to chase my waiter to take it back.    Honestly, the chicken was like what you'd get on a domestic airline but worse. My wife who's a very slow eater naturally anyway slowed down her meal as much as she could, but she still finished way before I got my burger. The waiter didn't follow through on my order and just let it ride like the previous time. The burger was again flattened like a pancake almost twice the size of the bun (nothing like the picture on the menu) and burned to crisp, I mean burned! This time I was ready and grabbed the waiter before he ran off and told him to get the manager pronto.  Several minutes later I get up, walk up to the receptionist and ask again for the manager, she informs me that they know but the manager is busy - the restaurant is at 60% capacity, so busy but not crazy busy.  I go back to my table, and a few minutes later remind the waiter, he too tells me the manager is busy.  Too busy for clients? I warn the waiter we're walking out. The manager shows up 3 minutes later and apologizes. I show him the flat burned out burger pancake and explain the problem. His excuse is they don't do medium rare they do pink, my wife pointed out you can't do pink when you flatten it out like that, the manager then tried to justify it with some story about mashed burgers.  So I left the restaurant after nearly an hour, still on empty stomach and angry as hell.",

The waiter came out talked to a table and went back into the back without even greeting us or getting us waters. We asked to change sections and in the next section we waited ANOTHER 10 mins before being greeted even though the server came out maybe twice... once we were finally greeted we didn't even get a name or introduction from our waiter. We went ahead and ordered drinks, food, and asked for the check because we could tell we wouldn't see him again anytime soon. The food came out and we had to ask for the check 3 more times because he kept forgetting. The food was terrible, which normally chili's food is awesome but this location absolutely sucked. My southwestern cesar salad looked NOTHING like the one on the menu. It was full of nasty, white, tasteless pieces of cheap iceberg lettuce.... the salad wasn't even green. My friend had the shrimp tacos and they were trash. The waiter didn't Check up on us at all, barely came out to check on anyone in the section. I had to walk back up To the host stand twice just to request a waiter. All in all this was the worst service ever at a restaurant it was total trash. I'm unsure how this establishment is still running. The staff can't multitask in the slightest.",

Our oldest daughter ordered chicken bites but we were told the kitchen staff ended up burning them so they made her chicken tenders and were going to comp the kiddie meal off the ticket. Pretty decent. We didn't say much but were pleased they took considerations.   My complaint was the salt level on the food. Both our full menu items (sirloin and the mango chicken) Disappointment occurred with my asparagus.

Chili's offers a grass-fed burger patty for $1.00 more, which wins my vote over other places.   As a food safety educator, I am always picky about the cleanliness of a restaurant. Upon entry, I noticed tables that were not bussed, though they did not seem to be understaffed. Usually a big no-no for me. However, the greeter was sure to place us at a table and thoroughly clean it to our liking. Earned their point back.   The food was delivered to the table exactly as ordered. I requested sauces on the side and a slight char to the burger....achieved.  Our server was quite hospitable and attentive.   In comparison to other locations, it was a positive experience. Certainly can not same the same for the Charlotte-Whitehall location. But, that's another review for another day.",

Finally became calmly frustrated then walked to the bar in order to pay my tab because I was sitting at a table in her section.  I never received the additional salsa requested 15 minutes earlier while I watched her serve 4 others in the same section.  As I paid my bill I reminded her that I had requested more salsa.
