The string could have been from someone's clothing & the wind made it land on my burger. I go up & ask for a refund for the burger because who knows how much string I already ate! The manager gives me no problems & gives me a refund. However the worker had something to say, in hush hush tones of course;bothered that I asked for a refund for a burger that was dirty.",

You give me a Carolina Classic and a medium Dr. Pepper in my hands and I'm a happy man. But seriously, not too long of a line, friendly guy behind the counter, \"fast\" food, full but not too loud crowd, walked-so-no-need-to-park, and so I was happy with my lunch today. As for the sandwiches itself, it was just as good as the first one I had. Hey, it got me through the whole trip to Target. And mattress firm.

If I had to review the food it would have 4 to 5  stars; but the service on a particular day this month was a  little troubling.  I come to this Wendy's often.  I work in the area and they are always moving very fast. and it seems if you are not on the same pace they are a litte annoyed.  My order was $4 and some change.  I gave the cashier a $10 bill and she only gave me change back as if I gave her a $5 bill.  I asked for the rest of my change and she said you only gave me a $5 bill.  I told her she was wrong and she called for the supervisor...actaully she yelled for the supervisor.  I pulled to the front talked with the supervisor, they count her drawer and it was as I said...I gave her a $10 bill.    I don't think the young lady was trying to scam me BUT I know they are moving very fast and they need to slow down b/c incidents sunch as these  The supervisor was blah towards me and not very apologetic at all.  If the supervisor was apologetic I would have felt better.    I would just make sure you say out loud what you are giving the cashier so you both are aware of the money given.",

Atmosphere - Newer, clean, busy, funny   Food - I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. While labeled as improved, it still was damp to the point of making the bun soggy. I think they keep these things in a bath of chicken broth to maintain moisture. For my side, I opted for the healthy mandarin oranges instead of fries. This gave the girl at the the counter a good laugh...as she said \"Oh, how cute\".   Service - Despite being made fun of...it was great. I called the counter girl out on it, in a funny way, by telling her that I was watching my figure. This got her and the girl behind her to laugh.   Price - combo meal $6.54   Overall - I look forward to trying that apple pecan salad...you know..because I am watching my figure!",

If I could give this place 0 stars, I absolutely would. Customer service is everything.  I pulled into the drive-thru and waited for my turn at the speaker. When it was finally my turn, the vehicle in front of me was still slightly in the way of me getting to the speaker. I could only see half of the board with the menu items. The attendant came on, I said, \"I can't see the number, but I would like the chicken nuggets meal\". The attendant and another employee busted out laughing through the speaker and said, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" I again said, \"I cannot see the entire board, I want whatever number the chicken nuggets meal is\". The attendant said, \"so you want a number 10\"? I reply  the same way that I did the previous TWO times. Seriously, tell me my total so that I can move on from this unnecessary experience!! Finally, she gave me my total and I pulled forward.  The attendant opened the window and whatever she was eating/chewing on almost flew out of her mouth when she greeted me, and again she thought this was funny. The sad part is that this attendant appeared to be \"in charge\". I was absolutely disgusted.  Like mentioned, this was my first experience, and certainly my last. This Wendy's location manager should be thankful that it's in a very busy spot. If not, the location would be closed down.",

Yesterday I took my children to see a movie and after the movies we encountered a display of unprofessionalism and unmannerable behavior I have ever witnessed. I pulled into your drive through and waited for 10 minutes and there were no answer. I yelled into the speakers multiple times and I received no answer. I assumed you all were closed. After googling to verify that there was no anomalie, i continues to yell. \"Excuse me!\" \"Anyone available?\" After minutes what felt like hours, I finally received an answer, \"Go 'head,\" I order. I pull up to the window. I stated, \"I thought you all were closed, no one came to the speaker for 10-15 minutes, the cashier looks at me as says \"It's OKAY\" in a condescending voice. In shock, I stopped and looked up, she then says \"hurry up I'm busy.\" I could not believe it. I stated \"Are you kidding me?\" My wife stated let's go. We left without food. I could not believe the level of unprofessionalism. I would have never assumed that someone employeed would ever say something like that. I understand this is late night at Wendy's but I can confidently say that myself or anyone else I encounter will not be visiting Wendy's again. To employee individuals such as this, that makes a huge statement of your companies core values and reputation. I have never witnessed anything close to this experience.",

The drive-thru was backed up so I guess that made the inside store slow because it took almost 20min for my food and then on top of that my fries were half done and my nuggets were cold and seemed like they were just re-fried.  That was a waste of good money and my time.  I won't be going back to this location. I've read the other reviews and apparently management doesn't care because nothing has been done about the negative customer service here.",

It doesn't matter if 7 cars are ahead of me or 2, I still end up having to wait a ridiculously long time at a fast food drive thru. There have been 1 or 2 times that I have been in line and have just left because it was taking too long. They do not even have friendly staff to make up for it.  The last experience I had here it was 2 am and there were only 2 cars ahead of us and it was still a 20 min ordeal. And to top it off I was missing a burger from my order.   If you just have a burning desire for Wendy's that will not go away and will wait as long as it takes to get it, than come here. If not, AVOID!",

On a recent drive thru visit, the individual who took my order was basically having a conversation with another employee while I was placing my order, which in turn probably caused the fact that my order was wrong.  And, second, they are very short and can be somewhat rude at times. Even though the service is poor and my orders haven't been right every time, I will say I do love their burgers. I always order the cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles only, add extra pickles. This way I know it is made fresh to my order and is always good. The fries are hit or miss. If made fresh they are great, but honestly you can tell when they have been sitting around for a while.  I do like that this location is close to where I live, but know there are better places for a quick burger and fries that aren't hit or miss.",

So here's really the only thing to know about this location: if you're running tight or short on time, don't hit the drive thru unless there's only one car in line. I'm not sure why, but it's always so slow.  The food is consistent with what you'd expect from a Wendy's. Although the drive thru is slow, I will say that every time I go the workers are nice.",

We decided to love to the window and the lady at the window, who was on her phone, turned her back on me as if I wasn't even there. Another lady was cleaning the kitchen floor just staring at us and mumbling words. We were given ugly attitudes when they could've just told us they were closed. Shameful. Will be staying away.",

The one thing I don't really like at this, or many other, places, is you get this somewhat pre-packed salads, which is kinda annoying, but the thing was huge, and I ate and ate and ate, and my co-diners were done some time ago. Felt bad, without feeling too bad.  But all in all, the experience wasn't horrible.",

With a nasty attitude. I tried to give her 40 cents. Because be the frosty was 1.40 I tried giving her 5.40 she said it was too late. Said take what I give you and have a nice day. Really I just threw the frosty away I'm done you guys don't worry about me ever coming back there and trust me I will be calling corporate. -5 stars",

They literally took one order at a time at the window. Equals out to one every 5 minutes. They are rude, act like people owe them something for coming to their store,rude people with no Sense of customer service. etc. find somewhere else to go to get a quicker meal: McDonald's, jack on the box, Burger King. Hell, order Chinese food and it will come out quicker than this damn sad excuse of a Wendy's.",

I'm not sure what's going on with this location but I hope it gets better. It is in a prime location, which allows it to get tons of traffic; especially being the only Wendy's in the area. However, partially raw fries and literally COLD chicken nuggets, is not appealing. I'm sure it isn't to anyone and definitely wasn't for me. The only reason I'm giving this location two stars, is because the employee who swiped my card was friendly and I didn't have to wait very long in the drive-thru line.",

On my most recent visit, I used the drive thru. Not only were they slow but the person ordering had no manners, people skills or common courtesy. When I got to the window, he just handed me my order and said \"Here\".   Along with that, I ordered my burger without mayo and it came with it anyway. I doubt I will be back here.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the only fast food restaurant that should actually have the \"fast\" revoked from the title. This is the only Wendy's in the area, so we are forced to return even though not one experience at this location has been positive. The food is consistent with every other location, but the service is so incredibly poor.   I've come during the day on weekends, afternoons and evenings during the week and always find that there could be no possible way a manager is working.   Sometimes they are completely out of drinks-like Coke and Sprite and Dr. Pepper. How lazy do you have to be to let 3 flavors run completely out?  Tonight we came and there were the only 2 employees working the drive through lingering outside. While we didn't think it was possible, it was. Both employees took their entire break together so so the line just kept growing with no movement.   Normally I wouldn't rate a restaurant on service, but this location is so bad I felt compelled to review a Wendy's on Yelp. Technically I'm not sure fast food joints even deserve a profile, but as you see by the overall rating, I'm not alone and the world should know what they are getting into.   Save time and sit down at a decent restaurant. Or if you must, other close by \"fast\" food options close by are Which Wich, Subway, Burger King, Chipotle, Tzikis, Zoe's Kitchen and Bojangles.",

The female employee at the window wearing the headset informed my mom, over the speaker, that she was dealing with a customer and hadn't greeted her yet. Those words don't read as rude but the tone of voice did. Mom apologized and stated that it won't happen again because she won't be back. The employee simply stated ok. Poor customer service can ruin a business. Perception is reality. The employee needs a break and also owes my mom an apology. My 9 year old nephew said she needs to be nicer. My 10 year old niece thinks maybe the employee needs additional training. In the end, the lesson is kindness on both sides of the window.",
