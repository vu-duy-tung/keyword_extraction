It's a no-mess, nothing fancy kind of place that's a great place to pick up a quick sandwich when your fridge is empty.   That said, I have never been disappointed by a sandwich. The bread is amazing, and the ingredients are fresh and prepared well. The steak and cheese is really great - not too greasy. We added sauteed banana peppers for a little crispness, which was amazing. The small sub is the perfect size, too. Not so big you get about 10 meals out of it, but enough to make you full.   Not the most amazing subs I've ever had (I'm from the East Coast), but definitely will be returning.",

Don't get a large unless you have help eating it all or are trying to OD on potatoes. Really love this place. I go here whenever I'm in this part of town.

    "text": "Another sandwich place franchise in town, with several locations in Charlotte.  The one located on Remount is close to work, so lunch I went.    Sandwich options is ok.  Chicken or beef mostly, cooked on the grill. There is cold cut option, but amazingly they have corned beef but not roast beef.  I had the Philly Cheesesteak while my bf had a cold cut turkey.    Ordering process is a bit chaotic.  So the first person behind the machine only takes sandwich order and your name... Nope they don't care if you want fries or drinks or anything, just the sandwich and name.  Then you go down not even 7 feet to another person, who now needs to finalize your order and take your money.  The problem is if you want fries, she has to yell out to the kitchen staffs, who are between the 1st order machine and the cashier.  And all of the sudden Greg or Craig become an issue.  So why don't we just tell the 1st person to begin with?  End result is you may or may not have your fries when your sandwich comes out.  Awesome!  The food quality is nothing spectacular. I like the crunchy bread.  But they don't give you much meat for $4.50 6-inch sandwich. It's more noticeable when you dont ask for much filler items.  I almost needed a microscope to find the turkey hiding under the lettuce.   The fries was good, but this is no Five Guys, these fries are not meant to be shared.   And lastly the staffs there were a little unsympathetic for such a new place... If they don't care now, gosh they really won't care later.   Good luck Penn Station, I think you may need it to survive.",

Five of our meals came quickly and were of decent quality.  The sixth meal was not received until 29 minutes later.  During that time we repeatedly asked about the missing order, and were initially told \"it should be on it's way.\" The staff seemingly took no effort to find out what the problem was.  Only after repeated queries did they decide to look for our order printout, verify that we had paid for that meal, then start trying to get it made.  IF SOMEONE SAYS THEY ARE MISSING THEIR MEAL, GET IT IN PROCESS, THEN VERIFY PAYMENT, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!!  After everyone was finished, we still had to wait for the last meal, and get it as take-out, so the rest of us could get back to work.   As a side note, there are NO SALADS on the menu.  They did make me a salad as a special request, and it was very poor.  My meal was received quickly. I am not sure what it cost (our copy of the receipt was not itemized) our party of six was $64.00.    You can eat way better food and have better service for that price elsewhere.",

I wasn't expecting much from a chain-sub type place, but the corned beef was freshly chipped and piping hot. It was loaded with a thick layer of melted cheese and plenty of russian dressing.

There you have it. I added sausage to the sub and it was pretty good. I would get it again. Next time i think I'll try another sub just to get another sub under my belt.

It was a pretty solid sandwich. They grill it up right then and then run it thru an oven...which is a nice touch. There were good flavors to the meat but the real winner for me was the bread! It was really delicious. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside...perfect!  Fries:There hand cut and could be really delicious if served up hot. But be careful, if you are getting to-go the fries come in a cup and all of them will end up at the bottom of your bag causing a greasy mess....just guess who was lucky enough to find that out the hard way!  Lemonade-Biggest downer....it was watery and even adding sugar when I got home didn't help. There was nothing freshly squeezed or delicious about it. Let's hope it was a bad batch.   I'm looking forward to trying more of their sandwiches. I'll keep you guys posted!",

I ordered the month's specialty: the pizza sub ( of course I forgot the exact name.) The presentation was beautiful and the sandwich could compete with some pizza places. Yes I know it would a different type of pizza with all that meat but still. One nitpick I had having little to do with taste was the relative lack of options. Still I feel as though another trip in which I order a \"regular\" sandwich would allow for a more complete review.   The service was quick and efficient yet professional and the restaurant was relatively well maintained. Unfortunately I forgotten my own golden rule: a reliable method of judging how well maintained a food joint is lies in how clean the bathroom is. But hey, how can I penalize the restaurant for my mistake.",

Tip: I'm also a customer - actually more than one since I usually order for my whole team at work. They haven't gotten a single special order right in the last two visits - something as simple as 'no mayo' seems like a challenge for them. Also their fries, which used to rival 5 Guys for greatness, always seem to be undercooked these days - by the time they get to our office (5 minutes away) they're a steamed pile of soggy potato-like substance that no amount of malt vinegar will remedy.

It was a little heavy on the mayo, but flavors were balanced.   Would I go back? Yes. Would I go back right now? No. Would I revisit the menu with a curious friend who just so happened to have a craving for a sammich and french fries? Of course.",

There's inside and outside seating along with a small to-go order table where people wait.   The subs are extremely delicious and easy to split between 2 people with a side of fries. Lots of meat, cheese, flavors, and veggies. Just tell them how you like it! The price point for a big sub and fries was around $15 so its a little high if you're planning on eating it yourself for lunch. They do offer a small sub for about $7.  Once I just ordered a large fries, about $5.50 and it was huge, hot, salty, crispy... just perfect! The employees are nice and helpful.

The first issue is you were supposed to order at the cashier at the end of the line instead of at the beginning of the line as you normally do. That should have been my warning, right there, But no, I went to the cashier and ordered my sandwich and fries with no drink.  I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited...for at least 30 minutes for friggin sandwich and fries.  One staff member asked me what I was waiting for and said my sandwich had been ready for 5 minutes but we were waiting on the fries. And I complained that my sandwich would be cold by the time the fries were finished.  The acting manager cutting the potatoes one order at a time. Let's wait some more..  I give them credit for trying to calm me down in my now irate status but it was not so successful.  The sandwich maker actually made another sandwich but yet the fries were still not ready.    I asked for my money back and this was also a hassle.  The sandwich maker again tried to calm me down. Finally at least I got a receipt but still no meal.  It was now an hour after I left the neighboring business.  At this time all I wanted to do is leave Penn Station and go to McDonald's where I know my food would be available almost immediately.  After checking with my bank 2 days later, I never received a refund. The manager at this place has no clue what he is doing. I promised them that I would never be back. I'm just glad it was just a $15 meal that I lost money on and not more than that.",

First, our food took a very long time to arrive, and there weren't many patrons in the place. Then, when our food came, it was all wrong and seemed to be thrown together in a rush. Also, there was only about 2 slices of meat on both our sandwiches and the person I was in ordered a larger sub. I would think the meat would be proportional to the sandwich, but apparently not.   Honestly, it was a situation where I wanted to say something once our food came out, and I should have, but we didn't think it would have taken as long as it did for the food and didn't have time to wait for a re-make.

When I arrived, no one was present. I immediately noticed the fabulous, spotless interior. The gentleman taking and preparing the orders was very polite and thorough. I ordered the chicken philly with mayo, onions and mushrooms and a small order of their freshly-cut fries. After paying a bit over $2 for everything, thanks to that awesome coupon, I chose a seat outside.   After 5 or 6 minutes, my order was ready. Everything was piping hot. The fries were perfectly crisp outside and super flavorful with just the right amount of salt. The sandwich was heavenly. The perfect ratio of meat to veggies to mayo to bread to cheese. The bread was soft inside and crunchy outside, the onions and mushrooms were perfectly cooked, the mayo was present in just the right quantity and the cheese was oozing from the sandwich. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. It was the perfect sandwich, indeed.   As I sat outside and dined (on a truly hot day), I was able to watch the LightRail zip past a few times which made for a delightful experience.   All in all, I will be back next time a Philly cheesesteak craving hits. Penn Station gets it right, which is surprisingly refreshing for a chain.",

Today a whole area of the restaurant was blocked off (entrance to building, seating area, and trashcan) for no apparent reason except less to have to clean at the end of the day. One time I went in a good 30 min before closing and they told us the oven was already shut down. I've come here several times because I get mailer coupons, but I'll be trying other places for cheese steaks in the future.
