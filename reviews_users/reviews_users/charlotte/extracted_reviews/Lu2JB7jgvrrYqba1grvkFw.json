Fried shrimp are usually my favorite but the salt and pepper catfish is terrific.  I will order just the catfish next time I come in ... which I hope is soon.  Great hushpuppies, received slaw but did not try it (just not a fan of coleslaw, except my own).  We went last week, it was threatening rain but the parking lot looked like Walmart at Christmas and 50+ people waiting at the front door.  Certainly worth the trip!

    "text": "My fiance and I came to this restaurant last night. I haven't been here in over 5 years (the last time I was here when I was like, 14 and still living with my family). I don't eat seafood (except shrimp), but I did remember they do have other options too. The parking lot was kind of full when we entered, so I guess that was a good thing. We got seated right away, and immediately got our drinks and hushpuppies. I literally couldn't stop eating them. They were so fluffy and good! The best part of the meal we had all night.  I ordered the chicken tenders with fries, and my fiance ordered the Captain's Grilled Platter. The food came with decent timing, but the tenders had absolutely no seasoning. So, so disappointing. The fries were nothing special either. I hardly touched them. The coleslaw also tasted like mushed up baby food.  The Captain's Grilled Platter comes with a fried crab (we had no idea what it was at first), a baked potato (with the skin soggy and burnt), a piece of flounder, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and coleslaw. He wasn't very hungry and wanted to bring the leftovers home. We noticed that more customers were being seated, and didn't think nothing of it at first. Then, we noticed that our waitress was taking 10-15 minutes at a time getting to us. We first asked for a box, that took almost 20 minutes. And we were so disappointed at that point, we just wanted to pay and get out. Because of the lack of service at the end, we didn't tip much at all. And the food was nothing special, only the hushpuppies were amazing.  One more thing to mention: they seriously need to renovate. We sat at a booth, and there was a big gap between the end of the table and the wall. The walls were also green and yellow and looked like they haven't been painted in years. The pictures were so tiny and looked like they belonged in a restroom. And the decor was just... outdated.   I'm not sure if we'll be back. Maybe in like 5 or more years if I happen to remember it.",

I tried the Alaskan Whitefish and the salt and pepper catfish fillet. Both were tasty, but there was enough oil to puddle on the bottom of my plate. I tried the onion rings and found them to be large and without much flavor.  The problem with the coleslaw is that they chop the cabbage too finely and it turns out more like a mush than a salad. The worst part was, even though the parking lot was almost empty, it took longer waiting in line to pay the bill than it did to eat the meal Would I go back? Yeah...the next time I have an overwhelming desire to listen to my arteries harden  while I ate!",

Today we waited at least 5 min. for the waitress to come by and drop off hush puppies. Then waited another 10 or so min. for something to drink before choking on the hush puppies. Being an ex-waitress myself, a customers drink should not get below halfway and we were sitting on empty for quite some time about 3 times total. It was difficult to eat without anything to drink so by that time you just give up and are ready to leave. And of course you wait again to pay the bill so you can leave. I'm not sure if it's the waitresses fault or lack of staff. In addition, I definitely don't want you to smell like cigarettes when you return either when I've been sitting here waiting on you.",

Me being from California find anyone who calls me 'sweetheart' or 'honey' very endearing :)  Anyway, we were seated and immediately were served a huge pile of hushpuppies with honey butter.  It was so awesome, I just kept popping 'em in my mouth.  The other 2 teachers I was with were regulars, so they skipped the hush p's.........more for me!  I ordered the salt and peppered catfish fillets with onion rings.  And it came out fairly fast while still being fresh out of the fryer.  It also came with coleslaw, which was very unappetizing.  I enjoyed my food very much and actually felt like my pant button was about to pop out.  But I only ate about 25% off my plate!  Very huge portions, very good food and very good service.

    "text": "Review is primarily for takeout, haven't dined it yet.   Who can argue with fried seafood?  One day out of the blue I got a craving for fried oysters.  Being homebound with a newborn my lovely husband went to pick up a couple of captain's platters - a generous heap of fried scallops, oysters, jumbo shrimp, little shrimp, fish, hush puppies and some deviled crab.  I ordered two platters for three hungry adults, plus three bowls of chowder, and there was enough food for dinner for all of us plus lunch for two of us the next day. The amount of food is of course the star.  The fried oysters hit the spot for me, and I also really liked the deviled crab.  The only negative thing I would say is that the platter was definitely dominated by the little shrimp - I suppose it's the cheapest thing, but the plates were like 65% little shrimp.  Yeah it was good but I'd prefer more of the other stuff.  Eh, not a dealbreaker.  The chowder was kind of mediocre. Not very expensive at all, especially considering the massive amount of food you get.  This might just be our standby local non-fancy seafood stop. As of 2/26/12 their website is kaput but their menu can be found at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fallmenus.com&s=fc06c95fb79ed04cecf8a34f2a1fe0af54e720572c6b7050d5a229da4d84cb5c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">allmenus.com</a>.",

    "text": "Went to Captain Steve's on Saturday, 3/7 for my friends daughters birthday. It was a large party of about 20 people. She called and they said to come at 6:00 pm. We arrived about 30 minutes early and we were seated on time. After received a group hymnal session and being blessed by the waitress we were pretty hyped. An hour later when our orders had not been taken our spirit began to deflate. Once the orders were taken, another hour passes and no food at all. Most restaurants wait until all of the food is prepared before bringing out the plates. So after waiting and hour, my husband asks what's the hold up and she says that it's the broiled plates that's holding everything up, really??? After about 15 more minutes I suggested to the actual waitress who was serving our table, in a very calm and cordial way I must add, if they could just start bringing out the plates as they were completed. She snapped and said  \"honey, y'all are not the only party here. We have 3 other parties that I have to take care of\". I was proud of myself and didn't snap back and instead told her that I understand, but we've been waiting over and hour for our food.  Meanwhile, all of the seats around us are being filled and they're eating!! I'm watching the carry out area and people are coming and going like crazy. We have children in our party and even the kids meals were not fulfilled. After being there for over 2 hours now, the father of the birthday girl approaches the Asst Manager, Mike and explains the situration. He says that he can't do anything and that he'll get the Manager. Do you think he ever moved from the hostess desk, nope. He stood in birds eye view of our talbe the entire night and never retrieved the manager. He was like a sack of potatoes that could not be moved.I asked the waitress again about our food and she says it'll be ready in 20 mins. We sat before 6:00 and now it's after 8:00pm. We should have just walked out, but by then it was too late to go somewhere on a Saturday night and be seated. We finally get our food and the broiled food that was supposedly holding up everything was not even hot. It's a fried food joint, it only takes about 15-20 to broil fish and even less time to fry it. What takes the cake is that it tasted like fish soaked in water. My husbands and I food was supposed to be blackened, instead it was sprinkled lightly with some type of seasoning that looked like paprika, but had absolutely no taste at all. All of the food finally trickled in except the kids meal. So a 5 year old was the only one still at the table waiting on a kids popcorn shrimp dish. The food was the worst seafood that I've ever had in my life. No one finished their meal. Then the other waitress comes back and sings another hymn, I guess to soften us up for the wait for the tickets. The nail in the coffin is that each ticket was of course charged a 15% gratuity and not one person came over in over 2  hours and 45 mins to apologize for the waiit or say thanks for being patient. My husband was right. He said when all of the singing started that they were softening us up for a bad experience. I guess with one waitress serving multiple tables, one bus girl and one food delivery person bringing out the plates, you can't expect much.   So if you decide to try this restaurant anyway, just remember that I warned you. You'd better go in with low expectations or you'll be extremely disappointed. This place is a \"0\" star, but you have to give it a rating, so ergo the \"1\" rating.",

The selection is very limited and they don't have senior platters like Captain's Galley. They offer small plates, but don't have jumbo shrimp as a selection.  I paid $15.00 for the regular order of jumbo shrimp and the shrimp was greasy and the table wasn't even wiped clean when we sat down.  The flounder was thin and portions small.  It is extremely expensive too.  I will wait until Captain's Galley in Matthews to reopen to get  wonderful seafood!",

My wife and I did this past weekend, and it was definitely worth the trip from South Charlotte.  The decor is simplistic but definitely works in their favor - it has more of a \"fish camp\" feel to it. The food is excellent but the portions are way too large for any one person, which amazingly enough is the only thing I didn't care for. My wife and I could easily have shared a plate, and will probably do so in the future.  Good comfort food here. My catfish filets were light and flavorful, and my wife's blackened flounder, she told me, was outstanding. The hushpuppies are to die for. Definitely plan on taking home portions for later!",

Seemed like a thin coating of cornmeal.  Everything else was good, but could barely eat 1/2 of the platter.  Reason is I had the raw oysters as an appetizer, and presentation was sub par, but I didn't care b/c they gave me 14 oysters shucked and placed onto lettuce for $5.95.  All I had to do was dab some cocktail sauce and eat.  Had the oyster stew, and it was poor.  A few fresh oysters in a light cream soup.  Not what I expected.  The clam chowder tasted OK.  The 2 combo platter with the fish filet gives you two huge filets.  Prompt service and a good mix of black and white folks enjoying the grub here.",

    "text": "I really do not like to write a negative review, but, this time I cannot help it.  I was the last person to arrive in our large party of 23 people.  I seated myself within my group.  As soon as I sat down, I borrowed a menu from another person within our party.  I barely opened the menu when the waitress asked me if I know what I wanted.  I replied not yet, please come back.  She promptly took the other's dinner requests and never came back to me.  I was sitting calmly waiting for her to return.  When another person in the party realized that I had not ordered, they went to the waitress area and a waiter promptly came over and took my order.  No hard feelings, everyone can make a goof. The gentleman across from me ordered the same thing I had.  It looked good.    My order was simple, chopped steak dinner, baked potato (extra butter, no sour cream), salad with french dressing.  The salad was fine,  the potato no extra butter, had sour cream.  The problem came in when I cut into the chopped steak, a combination of grease and blood came out onto my plate.  It was cold to the touch.  I sent it back.  In another 10 minutes a properly cooked steak, baked potato, garlic bread came out.  They also brought me out an order of Jumbo Shrimp that I did not want.  I passed that out to the others within my group.  When the bill came out, I noticed that a 20% tip was automatically added.    Another man in the group ordered a loaded baked potato, it was just a normal baked potato.  The lady across the table said that she hoped that next year they chose a different restaurant.   I know ordering a chopped steak in a seafood restaurant may not be the best choice.  If it is on the menu, I expect it to edible.  I am sure that the chopped steak did not meet the minimum temperature requirements for safe service.  Sorry Captain Steve, I will not be back.",

    "text": "RUN LIKE HELL!!! New to the area and I have heard so many people talk about Captains Steve's and how great it is so this past weekend I decided to try it out. I was really excited! We went on Saturday around 2pm for lunch. Wasn't a lot of people there so I thought perfect. This would be the perfect time to spend some time with my family, relax, and enjoy lunch. Walked in and never received a greeting welcoming us to the place. We had received dinner menus so as soon as I sat down I asked for the lunch menu was informed that they do not use the lunch menus on the weekend. Ok no big deal. Our waitress Kristen was the absolute worst!!! She had a horrible attitude! Never smiled and came across like we were bothering her whenever we asked for something or when we asked her to come back because we were still reviewing the menu. She failed to refill our water glasses and when we finally brought it to her attention she poured water all over our table and did not even offer to clean it up. Horrible customer service experience!! The food was just ok. Wasn't seasoned very well. Overall I was not impressed and will not be back!!!!!   **After talking with a few people about my experience. I learned that Captain Steve used to own this location on Monroe but it was bought out a few years back and they kept the name. not the same owners as the one in Harrisburg or Fort Mill. I'll try Captain Steve's again but it will NEVER be the one on Monroe.**",

    "text": "Captain Steve's has some pretty delicious and definitely inexpensive fried fish.  However, their sides (except the hush puppies) are nothing to write home about, which is a little disappointing.  I have been here a few times now.  On my first trip, I ordered the small plate of the fried Alaskan whitefish.  My partner ordered Steve's Fisherman platter.  Just before taking our order, the waitress brought us a basket of hush puppies with tubs of honey butter.  The hush puppies were fresh and quite delicious.  Then came our massive quantities of food.  The \"small\" platter of fish came with three large filets, more hush puppies, a heaping portion of onion rings, and a small plastic bowl of coleslaw.  The fish comes either with salt and pepper or plain.  I ordered the salt and pepper, and the fish was just delicious!  The batter completely coated the fish, but it was not too heavy and the seasoning was just right.  My biggest complaint is with the onion rings and slaw.  The rings were obviously made from scratch, but the batter was quite plain and the rings were flavorless.  The cabbage in the slaw was basically minced, and it was the slightly sweet vinegar style, which I don't care for at all.  But the fish was truly, truly delicious.  Steve's Platter included fried flounder (in the salt and pepper batter), calabash shrimp, deviled crab, fried oysters, fried scallops, and fried baby shrimp.  The flounder was also very tasty, although not as good as the whitefish (more fishy-tasting, but not necessarily bad).  The calabash shrimp was also SO delicious, with the texture and consistency of the batter being quite perfect.  The deviled crab reminded me of a crab cake with more of a pickle flavor, and I enjoyed it.  My partner greatly enjoyed the fried oysters, and while I am generally don't like oysters, I enjoyed them too.  The scallops were quite good, but very rich.  Finally, the baby shrimp were good and quite plentiful.  He also ordered the onion rings, and on the large platters, the sides are even larger still.    Other reviewers are correct - this is an INSANE amount of food.  I have always left here full and with another leftovers for a whole other meal.  Service has always been good.  The wait staff each time has been friendly and quite helpful.  The decor is very fitting, with fish and fishing gear spread across the restaurant.  However, I will say that it is quite loud in there when it gets busier in there.  Sound really seems to echo in there.  Other important things to know - Tuesdays is all you can eat crab legs night.  It costs $32 a person, but they bring out buckets of crab legs to the table.  On Wednesdays kids eat free.  The also offered broiled seafood for those who are wanting to be slightly more health-conscious.  It's also pretty reasonably priced.  My partner and I have gotten two dinners and two drinks, and each time walked out of there full for less than $30 + tip.  Come here with a big appetite.  So their seafood and hush puppies are both pretty decent.  However, this place would be even more magnificent if they just had some better sides (maybe dip the onion rings into the salt & pepper batter).  They get a solid 3 for now.",

I had not been here in years, and should have known something was up, because the parking lot had about 5 cars in it. I ordered the small flounder with a side of fried okra to go. While waiting in the lobby an employee yelled \"I'm tired of being treated like sh$t!\"... My second warning... It took about 20 minutes to get my food. I should have checked it, but I didn't. When I got home(10 min drive)and pulled the box out, I noticed that the box was not warm.My entire meal was ice cold. The fish was very hard and the okra was like rubber. I called the manager immediately and informed her of the meal and the behavior of the employee. She apologized and offered to make it over. I told her \"no thank you!\" I will never complain about a meal and send it back, or let any restaurant prepare me another meal...I watch TV and YouTube! I charged the $10.00 loss to the game. This place use to be so good. I will never dine here again!",

Ruined date night, we were so pissed to be treated like scum.  First time I've ever sent a steak back, not like we were trying to mess with them- I hadn't eaten off it, didn't even ask for a refund.  Still can't believe she brought it back to the table just to be a rude jerk.  Ugh!",

They ran out of crabmeat on a Tuesday night so my sister couldn't have stuffed flounder.  She said the flounder was ok.  My tradition at Fort Mill Captain Steve's is clam chowder and a half order or crab legs.  New England Clam Chowder should be white.  They added carrots and sprinkled it with Paprika.  No.  Terrible IMHO.  My crab legs were over cooked and looked terrible.  The meat crumbled.  I have never had that happen anywhere but I had already returned the chowder.  And here is the absolute worst - They gave me margarine to dip the crab in.  Flavorless yellow Jell-o goop.  I'd rather use movie theatre \"butter\" than margarine.  Shape up Charlotte Captain Steve's!  And for the general public choosing, I highly recommend Fort Mill. Highly.",

Now, I don't usually have an issue with some other posters complaints and I do agree that sometimes, the service can be hit or miss . Some servers are great while others appear to be disinterested. By and large, it's a no frills place but you are coming for the food ---while both should be a great experience , it's the food that keeps me and my friends and family coming back here to eat.  Portions are very generous and I have never left the place without taking some of my meal home. My son usually orders the mixed fried platter and your eyes just pop when you see it set down in front of you! He is 6ft. and 185 lbs and even he can't finish this. I usually order the grilled shrimp salad but I ask the server to substitute the jumbo fried shrimp which I gladly pay extra for as you get 8 or 9 of them and that is more than enough for me. Hush puppies are good too. I wish they would add a bit more horseradish to their cocktail sauce , though. I would have given a total of five stars in my review but like I stated, the service could be a bit more polished ---otherwise, it's a great place if you are wanting fresh seafood and lots of it.",

No one came back to check on us We had to flag down someone else to have our check brought tot the table. I could go in to further details but let's just say that over all it was close to the top of the bad experience list and we have had quite a few.  To be honest I would put it a #3.  In general I would not recommend anything about this place. Even the water was mediocre at best.",

Someone posted a photo of the shrimp that were not deveined  which  I could have gone without seeing. I tried to suck it up because the shrimp were miniature so I would imagine most of the time they are not deveined but the breading hides it. Anyway, I survived and the shrimp tasted just fine. The cocktail sauce was good and spicy, and side-note, they serve awesome ranch dressing.   Overall the food was pretty good and super plentiful ..the small platter (around $8.50) easily made two meals.    Where they fell off for me was cleanliness. The place just felt dirty....basically everything on the table seemed to have a thin layer of grease on it.  I know it's tough when serving fried food to keep menus and tables clean, but when large crumbs fall out of the menu that's a good sign they need a little scrubbin.   The service was on the slower side but they were busy splitting bills for a large birthday party. Overall we were happy with our server and this wasn't a big deal.",

We came in with a party of 7 adults and 3 kids. 75% of the items we order, they did not have, and most of them we found out after a long wait. I waiter was initially nice, but I guess he got overwhelmed because he kept forgetting items we ordered, and the kitchen did not have it together. He told us they only had 2 cooks available for the night, and that was the problem. The spaghetti dish someone ordered was rancid, not only bad tasting, but completely sour and inedible. Completely rude and unprofessional staff. I would not recommend this restaurant at all.",

    "text": "Sometimes you just feel like a big plate of fried seafood.  We've driven past Captain Steve's on several occasions and always saw a full parking lot.  A friend of mine went there, and told me it was pretty good and that they offered huge portions for the prices.    It was a Friday night and, in the mood for seafood, we finally decided to give the Captain a try.  We got there around 6:30 p.m. and, thankfully, didn't have to wait to be seated, despite the almost full parking lot.  Had we gotten there a bit later, though, there was a definite wait on a Friday night.    The interior was well-themed and, since it looks like the building used to be a giant rollerskating rink, was much nicer inside (with a lot of dividing walls) than I had anticipated.    Instead of bread, we were brought a basket of round hushpuppies as a little appetizer.  Wow.  They were the best hushpuppies I've ever had; not dry at all, and if they were, the honey butter accompanying them would have made them slide down easy. :-)  The menu was pretty full.  They had a lot of \"basic\" fried and broiled seafood options, including combination plates.  I hadn't had fried clams in a long time and had a craving for them.  I ordered the large portion since it was only about 75 cents more than the small.  What a large portion it was.  It was a definite mound of fried clams for only $8.50 or so -- plus a side item.  I brought about half of the clam strips home, although I'm not quite sure if we'll eat them.  Reheated fried clams doesn't sound all that appetizing.  Next time I'm going to try something broiled.  Although tasty, all of that fried food made me very sleepy...at around 8:00 pm on a Friday night.",

When you order scallops, even with one of their platters, they give you several instead of 3 or 4 like some seafood places.  Same with everything else.  You can get it fried or broiled and they have all you can eat specials of crab legs.  I had a broiled platter including filet of flounder, scallops and grilled shrimp with a side of fries.  The worst thing in that group was the fries which were flavorless and could have been cooked longer.   The fish was good with 2 thinly sliced filets.  The shrimp was a little over seasoned for my tasted but it was cooked perfectly.  And the scallops were quite good.  Service is great here.  Everyone was so friendly and appreciative of your business.  The place is also huge so it can definitely handle larger groups.  And from what I understand, this place gets packed on weekends.",

So far, they're hitting one out of every ten out of the park (Aria being that \"one.\" Their fettuccine carbonara with shrimp is SO bomb). The rest are just.....  I came here because my deddy swore it was the sh*t. I see now that my deddy is a liar and I now question everything he's ever told me to date.  Let me say this: the food wasn't horrible. It just wasn't cooked properly (super mushy scallops, light skinned breading on everything, etc). Additionally, I'm not sure who the owners are (and by who, I mean \"do Black people own this establishment? Are Black folks in charge of the kitchen?\"), but I'd love to have a looksy at their seasoning cabinet. Assuming that there even was one, I'd guess it was locked and they lost the key today because it was as bland as a face with improperly filled eyebrows. I get that you don't want to overdo the seasoning due to preferences but when I eat fish, I want fish with a kick. When I eat shrimp, I want shrimp with some umph. When I eat oysters, I want oysters with pizazz. See where I'm going here? If you're ferociously shaking your head \"no\" to brother salt, sister pepper, deaconess garlic powder, and elder Old Bay, you end up offering a plate situation similar to jumping in the ocean and biting Nemo in the ass, then tossing the remains at patrons. Not nice, Steve. Not nice at all.  Again, the food isn't horrible. It just needed more. More seasoning, more time in the grease, more umph.",

    "text": "Throwback to an earlier era. Basic, large place with no real ambience. I knew that in advance but still decided to try for lunch (weekday- not crowded) because I had a yearning for fried scallops.   Was quite surprised at how delicious they were. There were 8 good-sized pieces on my platter ($10.95, including iced tea and one side, plus good hush puppies) and scallops were tender and succulent. (Can't believe I'm using these words and giving a 4-star review given my recent 2-star one for a noted Charleston restaurant.)  I was told that the scallops were fresh. Tasted that way.   The other meal was fried jumbo shrimp. Also very good.  One side item was served cold but they reheated it. Can't speak to what service would be like on a weekend if crowded, but certainly friendly and competent at our lunch.   One could spend $6-$7 for lunch- pretty cheap. I just picked out a more expensive choice.",

This food just covered the plate. I had 1 piece of catfish. I asked the waiter about the amount of food. He checked in the back and said that the plates were correct although he agreed the plates looked like small plates. I told him I was not happy and would they be cooking some more he said no. So i said cool not going to make a scene. I told him not his fault however will not be back. No manager came to address the situation. The hostess came by and asked how was things. I told her no I was not happy. Still was calm she didn't ask why or nothing just walked away no apology. I will never go to the Monroe rd location again. Ft. Mill is much better and you get what you pay for. No one cared or addressed my concerns.",

She never came back, we had to grab another waitress to get our check and cash us out. And she never apologized or anything. My husbands broiled fishermans platter was decent but my food was terrible. I ordered the Steves fried combo but received the fishermans fried combo which was even bigger. The baby shrimp had a funny taste to them, the fried scallops were undercooked and the fried oysters and large shrimp were okay. I ordered the Mac and cheese as a side. Disgusting, it tasted like the dollar store off brand boxed Mac and cheese. The only delicious thing there was the hush puppies and the she crab soup I ordered for an appetizer. We waited 25 minutes before my husband got pissed and got up and got us to go boxes for our selves and when he did that then another waitress finally noticed us. Mind you there were only 2 other tables sat in the dining room with 4 other waitresses so they weren't \"busy\" like AT ALL. To say I'm extremely disappointed and will never go back to this place is an understatement. Do not waste your time or money on this place.",

    "text": "I've been going to this \"fish camp\" for years.    It's like a HUGE 2 dining room building...very open with tall ceilings...lots of tables and booths.    During prime time hours, it can get really busy with lots of \"INTERESTING PEOPLE\" to look at.    Menu has typical seafood items grilled, broiled and fried.  Shrimp, Scallops, Clam Strips, Oysters, Crab Legs, Lobster etc.  They also have great side salads with Bacon, Cheese, croutons, cucumber erc.  The dressings are super good.  PORTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY HUGE!  The \"small fried shrimp\" platter is enough to feed 2 people.    They also have some pastas like Lasagna, Spaghetti, Fettuccine.  They have Burgers, BBQ, and Steaks (which i prolly wouldnt try a steak here).  Side items are FF, Homeade Onion Rings, Slaw, Broccoli, and other things like that.    Varied menu for sure. I have tried most things at least once....and i would say that they obviously do seafood the best...and the fettuccine is a close second.  The rest, i could take it or leave it.  One pet peeve of mine, (which some people seem to enjoy) is that they have a \"singing waitress\".  The woman can sing gospel like none other, but shes so damn loud and disruptive. ...it really gets on my nerves....and it distracts all the servers from doing their job efficientally. Save your sinnging and witnessing for the church house.....not the seafood house.  She really does it for the attention and when she gets done singing....she then races through the dining room drawing attention to herself by acting all panicked that shes got to catch up on her tables and get back to work.  VERY DRAMATIC.  UGH!  People record video of her...and im sure she is waiting on a video to go Viral so she can get a \"big break\".   I think i may have one or two in my phone as well...guilty.  All in all, this place will be a regular stop for me simply because when i eat out....i dont always want the typical Plaza Midwood selections....or a coorperate meal....this is a way to switch it up.  Definitely not a 5 star experience, food is a 4 star experience,.....but the singing waitress brings it to a 3 star for me.",

Ordered a broiled seafood platter - it was very reasonably priced and we could have shared it and been done.  Flounder, Oysters, Shrimp two ways, Scallops and more.  Instead, we also ordered clam strips.  In the end, we brought quite a bit home.  In any case, the food was prepared just right.   On the downside, the affordability seems to bring out the K-Mart crowd.  Additionally, the ambiance is lacking in pretty much every way.  This place could do with a bit of a decor overhaul, along with some healthier prep on the menu (most everything is deep fried) and an updated beer menu.",

After a couple of visits I have zero complaints about the food: the fish has always been fresh, the sides filling (hush puppies!), and the drinks (sweet tea!) bottomless. But I always leave feeling slightly let down. I think a lot of it is down to the fact that this location has been a fish camp for decades, but no longer attracts the crowds it used to, meaning you may be eating in a half-empty room. (Note that although the name and decor are the same, this location is no longer owned by the team from Captain Steve's in Fort Mill.) Will I be back? Probably, but I also won't stop looking for another casual seafood option.",

It was empty during dinner time on a Thursday night. That should've provided all I needed to know . But, I entered looking for some tasty fish.   It was a lukewarm welcome from the employees up front. The waitress was very cordial but the atmosphere was still that lukewarm. Just not a good feel. The restaurant as was the parking lot was not crowded.  I ordered catfish, fries and slaw. I got some hush puppies and they were average and nothing to write home about (oops am I doing that now?).  Although, that was the best part of the meal. Catfish was falling apart and bland. The fries were decent.. just decent. The slaw was too creamy drowned in mayonnaise.   I'll stick with the Fort Mill location..",

It had a ever-so-slight kick to it - as well as the dipping sauce - it was really good!   Side salad was good   I ordered baby shrimp and a side of fries - the small seafood platter is plenty for a single person. It also comes with a small cup of coleslaw. You could probably share this platter with someone. I took half of it home in a to-go box.   The hubby got catfish strips with a side of fries. It also came with a small cup of coleslaw.

The food is tasteless and has absolutely no flavor. I ordered from here recently and they ruined my order and when I called to tell them the manager was super rude and hung up on me. I was absolutely  taken because all of my experiences prior had been awesome. The manager above him then called me back to apologize and asked how she could fix it. I replied a refund with be nice since we hadn't eaten the food minus tasting it. She told me they couldn't do that. I will never eat here again.",

The one in Fort Mill is much better.Plan and simple. the fish and shrimp were both over cooked....I really think the plates and platters we ordered was reheated from lunch of the day before. The baked potatoes were brown the server was nice but did not replace. need I say more. This was a Sunday afternoon the first week of July 2014 I haven't been back",

There is often a long wait at peak hours. I would suggest going early if you want to get in in a reasonable amount of time. My nephew loves the aquarium near the hostess podium.   Good hush puppies.  It's an inexpensive southern experience. Why not? (High cholesterol is a good answer to that question- but other than that I mean).",
