Grits are well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. Breakfast burrito served with a side of what looked to be fresh salsa had a couple corn chips in it, a trick in going to borrow next time I make those for the kids. Attentive and friendly staff, and the icing on the cake was Luuuuuuke and some of his Panthers boys were sitting in a booth. Made my day. :)",

When I arrived to pick up the order,  the Impossible Bacon Cheese Burger was missing from the order. Only when I pointed this out to them did they tell me that they were out of Impossible burgers. Then they offered a veggie burger replacement. So then I waited for that. By the time I was ready to eat my meal the waffle fries were cold. No apologies from the woman I dealt with for not noticing that part of the order was missing, no offer to make a new order of fries to go the burger I had to wait an additional ten minutes for. The whole point of calling and paying ahead on the ChowNow app is so you don't have to wait for the food. The ChowNow app asks for a phone number so the restaurant can call you if there's a problem with the order. They did not call ever.",

The design is very clean and modern, but it retains a neighborly feel. They have great options for any meal, and their daily specials (Pho-rito, lobster rolls, etc.) are amazing! Parking in the garage makes it easy and convenient to access and they have a range of indoor and outdoor seating options.  When I come, my friends and I love ordering from the bar or buying a bottle of wine to drink there, and playing their board games. The relaxed and friendly atmosphere makes this the kind of place you want to hang out for hours!",

Whether you need a large table to play board games, or maybe a nook by the window to eat your ice cream, or maybe you want to sit outside and people watch, they got you.  2. Draft beer, canned/bottled beer, coffee, ice cream (Two Scoops), deli/kitchen, wine, fresh pasta (Pasta & Provisions), charcuterie stuff, groceries--anything you're in the mood for they got. While this variety is awesome, it does make for a confusing first-time experience. Just so ya know, you can open a tab and use it anywhere inside (deli, coffee bar, bar, etc.) and then close when you leave.  3. As for food: - Their Southern Style Reuben is an interesting creation but if you're a mega reuben fan like me, it's meh.  - Their cobb salad (really why I came here to write today) is BOMB. It's only $8 and includes meat??!?! Really fresh and delicious. Also, I asked for honey mustard dressing, even though it wasn't listed, and they had it! It tasted homemade. It was really good and high quality.  - I haven't had their breakfast yet, but that is my friends' favorite thing to get there. Still to try. It's served all day too!!  4. Staff is always friendly whenever I go.   ** Also, when I went last night, one of the employees told me their menu was changing soon. So keep your eyes peeled.",

First, a place that serves breakfast all day is OK in my book. We're from the NYC area and have struggled to find places that do all day breakfast since leaving, so this was a nice surprise. He had the chicken biscuit and I had the people's breakfast platter with a biscuit and bacon. Both dishes are NO joke for the price, they're huge. Their biscuits are big and fluffy. The chicken was fresh and crispy, and the grits that came with my platter were flavorful. The hash browns are very greasy spoon which would be perfect for a hangover. The one thing I didn't love was the eggs. Mine were very overcooked and just not appetizing, but that was just a small miss. We also got coffees here-a vanilla latte for me and a cold brew for him. Both were delicious. The market itself had a fantastic beer and wine selection, along with lots of great local and semi-local products. I definitely want to come back to try more breakfast items and some of their weekend cocktails.",

They also have recycling receptacles and moved to biodegradable to-go containers! Thank you People's Market for listening to your customers' feedback!! (Or just realizing how y'all could be better for your community and for the environment and it's not crazy expensive to implement!) Thanks!   Review in December 2017: Potential for sure with a great location, but if you're going to call out vegan options, deliver. The vegan burger was better than the boring vegan sandwich with a very small amount of bland hummus. Also, how about containers you can recycle or compost or have a smaller impact like paper? Those #6 containers are not recyclable. And where are the recycle bins to dispose of what you can recycle??   We will not be recommending this place to friends and family until it improves.",

Before placing your order here, though, you had best look around to see if a table is available. Sure, they have lots of tables, but so many are taken up with folks nursing a cup of coffee while setting up an office. Saw one guy taking up a 4 person table with his laptop and even a printer! Shoes off, he had is feet up on an opposing chair while he apparently conducted his business. During my two visits, I found over half the tables were taken by long time Laptop users, which is apparently encouraged by management.

Sadly we felt that The People's Market doesn't live up to the standards in and around Charlotte.  Places like Earles Grocery, Common Market and Sunflower Bakery are miles ahead of this spot.  I hope that it is only growing pains and that this place will offer a better variety of items.  On the plus side, it is a large space with plenty of seating.  On the down side it looked like it was a pop up deli that couldn't bother to finish unpacking before opening.  The menu is ok for a deli and there seems to be way too much open space.  We waited to grab a cup of coffee and were never acknowledged and never asked if we needed anything.  I am sure this place will grow into itself, just way more options in the area until it does.",

Good parking options 2. Awesome open layout with a ton of tables, bars, etc, several outlets for working while eating 3.Lots of local, small business treats all around the market 4. All of the employees were incredibility nice  5. Good Latte  6. Nice music playing, easy listening 7. Open late-ish for a deli   Con's  1. different areas for ordering drinks and food makes it more challenging to get your food and pick up from different locations especially if you have a laptop set up. 2. Pricer in my opinion, but hey you're in Dilworth. 7 bucks for a bacon egg and cheese and $2.15 bottle of water 4. Really cold in the market  Considering this place just opened, it was running very smoothly and I'll for sure come back to visit. A lot more pros than con's which really weren't a deal breaker. I really enjoyed all of the space, open layout and so many windows. It's a nice addition to the area.  A casual place to grab a bite or drink while on East Blvd.",

    "text": "I personally had a stellar experience at The People's Market. The Lady and I stopped in here for a Sunday brunch, and were pleasantly surprised at the variety and price point of all of the menu items!  First off, parking. The Lady and I call that shopping center \"Dilworth Dilworth\" because it houses Pio Pio as well as Thai Thai. So it makes sense. Feel free to use that for yourself, you're welcome ;) We parked there and walked across the street.  We walked in and pretty easily figured out that the food ordering was in the back, so that's where we head! Two things here: They should probably get another register in the back for busier days, and they should also figure out which way the line will curve. There's not too much space, and aside from waiting for the guy in front of us to figure his life out, we had multiple people ask if we were in line or where the line was. I ordered the BLT and The Lady ordered a breakfast burrito. We gave our name, and headed to the bar to wait. There's a water machine there that was supposed to be able to produce hot, room temp, and cold water, but I think the temp functions may have been not working? Anyways, we grabbed water, took a seat at the GORGEOUS bar, and ordered ourselves a beer. I would also suggest for The People's Market to get updating draft menus like at breweries, because sitting on the end, it was hard to figure out what exactly was on tap. When we went, they had a fantastic list of really unique brews that a lot of places don't carry (including Deschutes!! Welcome!!). I saw they also had a nice esspresso machine on the other side had we gone the more traditional breakfast route, but luckily breakfast is served all day!  Our name was called and we got our food - which was absolutely to die for! The Lady loved her burrito and my sandwich could not have been more perfect. I heard they're still making a few changes to the menu, but either way, they know what they're doing in the back. Walking around the market, I was curious what market-esque things they had. Craft beer bombers? Check. Local snacks? Check. Bitters, pimiento cheese, cheesecake? You got it. I still do think that they could make do with some more local market type things, such as pastries and/or wine, but they've got time to stock up. Overall, The People's Market is off to a great start, and I'd gladly return to try out multiple items on their menu.",

Overall, I like the concept.  I'd agree with some of the previous reviews saying it's a little \"confusing\" but I think  you come into a relaxed atmosphere, clean-modern space, where you can just relax (do some work with the free wifi), meet up with friends, have a bite, etc.  The staff will help direct you to whatever you are looking for :)  The staff are really nice.   Bartenders have to do a little \"extra\" here since there's an ice cream case and the kitchen is in the back by itself.  I always am a fan of the princess leia artwork on the walls as well as the huge bookshelf of board games.  Concrete floors and wood tables give the space a warm and industrial feel while the large windows let in a lot of light.  Their outdoor patio seems to be a hit... whenever the weather started getting nicer, it was always a sure bet to find people out there when I drive by on East.  There are plenty of tables and chairs... lots of single-seat bar seating that gives you access to outlets and USB chargers for all your devices.  High top, regular seating, tables..... if you can't find a chair you like in this place, there may be a problem.",

    "text": "Friday lunch- Fried seafood special. Choose from perch, catfish, whiting or shrimp. Daily specials vary. I opted for the Salmon BLT with aioli on side. I also ordered tots as my side. You are called by name when your food is ready. I think they should consider a number system for those who dine in. There are a lot of people who work in this space. Having your food served to you would ease some of the stress of having to wait around to have your name called.  I tasted the sandwich without the aioli. It's way better with the aioli. You need it. It's creamy and garlicky, complimentary to the fatty salmon and the salty bacon. Not sure of how the sandwich would differ in taste if the aioli was slathered on the bread. Try it out and let me know. The tots were ok, nothing to write home about.  The People's Market at Dilworth is loaded with some of your fav local products. Cloister honey, Enderly coffee, two scoops creamery, artisan tropic plantain chips, pasta and provisions, king of pops, Lenny boy brewing, etc. A one stop shop.   Breakfast is served all damn day! In my opinion, there aren't enough restaurants in Charlotte that offer an all day breakfast menu. This spot has all the makings for a killer brunch on any day. Breakfast served all damn day, a coffee bar, prosecco and oj at the ready. Check all the boxes.  Hey Brunch, I'm coming for ya!",

I would really come back and work remotely from here. Per my guy, this place is calm, animal friendly, they have a deli at the bar. This is like your Starbucks combined with a Panera bread with a grill in the back.   We ate our chicken biscuit and left. Oh and another plus about this place is they have games such as Jenga, connect four, taboo, operation, scrabble or bring or own definitely dope place! I'd definitely be back!  As far as location it's on the corner and not in the most easiest spot to move in and out from.",

BLT was average, nothing memorable that would drive me back here. Champagne priced well. The reason for 2 stars was the service. They were not welcoming whatsoever and when I went to the food counter I stood there until I asked the guy behind the counter if I could order. I find this extremely unacceptable. No business should ever make people go out of their way to spend money unless they have top notch food and are known for this type of thing. Peoples market you are not one of those places.",

Went for a sandwich and coffee - the sandwich counter lost our order and it took us 30 minutes to receive 2 sandwiches and the coffee gal seemed confused by the coffee order.  Their water machine wasn't working, so I had to also purchase 2 bottles of water.   This place has potential and a good atmosphere.  Will likely give it a second chance.",

    "text": "I stopped by The People's Market to continue my adventure around Charlotte to try all the Reubens the city has to offer. Although most of the unique, non-traditional Reubens have been unimpressive, this one was a hit.   The People's Market boasted a 'Southern Reuben', swapping out the kraut for coleslaw and tossing on mustard instead of Russian. They also subbed in pastrami for corned beef - all around a very different sandwich than your traditional Reuben.   Although it wasn't one of the best Reubens I've had around Charlotte, it was a quite tasty sandwich. The pastrami was unbelievable - juicy and flavorful, it's everything you could want from the main part of a sandwich. The slightly sweet coleslaw was balanced out by the bite of the mustard. The cheese was barely noticeable on the first half as it had somehow migrated to the second half (literally it was coated on the second half and I couldn't find it on the first half), but that second half of the Reuben was perfect when all the flavors came together.   My biggest issue was the bread - they didn't toast it. Although the rye was ok, the untoasted bread just doesn't work on a Reuben.   Overall I think this Reuben is worth a try for it's creativeness, but there are definitely better Reubens around the city.",

Awesome interior, friendly staff, great food and beer choices. Not pleased as much at the prices - high, even for the area. $6 for a pint of beer and most sandwiches were $10 (with no sides). Enjoyed my food tho. Took a flyer and got \"The People's Burger\" (I think) - burger with beer, grilled pineapple and cheese. Delicious but hard to hold. Got the tots too. Will come again.",

    "text": "I stopped into this market with a friend on a whim because we were in the neighborhood and I will definitely come back.  I love the look of the place although it looks like they are still stocking up on merchandise for the shelves.  The layout is a little different and a tad bit confusing but hopefully they will work it out in due time.  We headed back to the food counter and I chose the vegan burger and curry lentil soup and my friend had the egg salad and bacon sandwich (she added avocado) and chips.  I would have loved to have a vegan cheese and mayo option for the burger and would love to see some baked potato wedges or some type of French fries. The food arrived in a timely fashion but the burger was in plastic container which was kind of odd. Maybe butcher paper or something else would be better.  The burger was a thing of beauty and the only thing I changed was I had raw onions instead of the cooked ones put on mine.  The taste was pretty good but the burger itself needed seasoning and if vegan mayo isn't available maybe a special sauce would be cool.  The curry lentil soup was sooooo stinking good. Yum. Yum. Yum!!  My friend said her sandwich was really good and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We sat at the bar area and the woman working behind the bar was so nice and even let us sample some kombucha that I would definitely purchase next time I go.  It was fizzier than usual, more like a soda almost.  The name escapes me right now.  She asked us our thoughts on the food and I shared about ways to improve the vegan burger and she genuinely received the feedback.  She pointed out the owner at the front and as a woman of color, I was thrilled to see the owner is a man of color.  Some may not understand that but it's nice to see.    On our way out, the owner asked us how everything was and he sensed my hesitation about the vegan burger and asked me about it.  I shared my thoughts and he too, accepted the feedback graciously and was thankful it.    Oh, and I forgot to mention that they do have vegan dessert options but the woman who makes them was on maternity leave at the time of my visit so when I go back I hope I can get to try it.  The ice cream from Two Scoops is all dairy but hopefully one day they'll have a non-dairy item.    This place has some improvements to make but with an owner who seems to be willing to receive constructive criticism, they can be made.   That is all!",

    "text": "My first visit of this highly anticipated neighborhood market was disappointing. With not so far away competitors Earl's and Common Market, People's Market needs to step it up. I feel like they are no more than 70% there in any aspect of their execution. But, there is a ton of potential for this place to be fantastic.   Here are the issues I found:  1. Not enough selection. Sparse shelves with limited selection. Too much space dedicated to seating and not enough to buy.   2. Limited beverage selection more like a Convenience Store than a local market. My water selection was limited to Dasani and the likes. No sparkling water selection, no artesian water selection.  Ditto for soda selection. If it isn't a Coco Cola product don't look for it at People's Market.   3. Fresh foods seem more like a local deli than gourmet market. Maybe that is all they are shooting for. The menu was uninspiring. My wife ordered the highly recommended chicken biscuit. She expected a fried chicken breast but received chopped up dark meat reconstructed when fried in the batter. This should have been disclosed as she wouldn't have ordered it.   They do focus on locally sourced selections and beers (but not soft drinks), which is great. They just need more of everything and to step it up with the food to attract the neighbors as regulars.",

Justin and I went for breakfast on a weekend morning, and i enjoyed my breakfast. I thought the portion was hearty and they had great gluten free bread. Justin wasn't totally impressed with his breakfast burrito, and they were still new, but the deli menu was expansive and they had some local offerings, too.   We went most recently on a Sunday for lunch after a car ride. I had the cobb salad and a side of cucumber salad.  He had an egg salad sandwich and a bag of chips.  Both of us enjoyed these very much. The frist trip, the food scene was more of like a food museum -- with like one or two random cans of this or that -- honey, or jam, or one or two bags of the same coffee. When we went the second time, they had fuller shelves, and also fuller seats. It was wonderful to see the place buzzing.  I think they'll make it. There is ample parking even though East isn't always desirable to drive down.",

I had the Vegan Burrito on my first trip and while the flavor was delicious there was so much grease that it hurt my stomach. My second trip I got a coffee and donuts but it was my third (and FINAL) trip that made me extremely disappointed. They claim to have 2 different Vegan Burgers but they actually are NOT vegan! All of the components are vegan BUT they serve them on a brioche bun which has egg and milk in it! The only other option aside from getting it on wheat toast is the gluten free bun but oh again, it has egg in it too. So disappointed and so not right. How many vegans have come here and eaten a burger, thinking it was vegan because they say it is and trust them?!??! If you really care about getting real vegan food, there are much better options in the area.",

So I ordered an egg and veggie wrap with potatoes and some sort of cream sauce. I liked it a lot, but after sitting down at the bar and getting to know the bartender, she informed us that some menu changes were coming down the line and that would not be on it.. boo. That being said, the beer selection was great and the bartender was fun to talk to without being annoying either. Everyone here is really kind.   Upon the second visit, the same bartender actually remembered us! We continued the convo and trying even more beer options and I also ordered another menu item. Wasn't as impressed, but it won't stop me from going back again.  The atmosphere here is really chill. Music varies, but it's all fun and easy to listen to while you eat/read/work. It's one of those places you can come to hang or just for a quick bite. Outside they have a fireplace which is superrr toasty on a cold day. :)",

To order food, you walk all the way to the back.   The order coffee you go to the first bar section.  If you want to order a sandwich and get tap water, you order in the back and then wait in line at the coffee section to get water.  I think they should have self serving water out like Amelie's to solve this problem.   There is a huge variety of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic.  I love the way everything is displayed it's very trendy.    I ordered the blt sub cheese for tomato (I'm slightly obsessed with cheese) and my husband got the chicken salad.  Our food came out super fast.  My sandwich was wrong, but they were quick to fix it so I thought that was really good customer service.  The sandwiches were good but nothing special or unique.  We ordered chips as a side.    I would like to go back for breakfast because it looked like that is what most people were ordering.    This is a cute place to bring out of town guests.",

I ordered the sandwich first. Bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. I actually ordered it for my husband, but I took a small bite it was really tasty. My only qualm is that they use American cheese... lord knows why? Can that really even be considered cheese? I wish it was an aged cheddar or something else really.. anything other than American cheese. The sandwich was $5 and it was large too... so the size and price worked for me!  I was surprised at how quick the sandwich came out. That was pretty awesome.   I then went and ordered a cup of coffee. It was a little over $2 for a local roast. This seemed reasonable to me especially because it was a local roast.   Very cool spot. I was rushed (due to said move), but I look forward to stopping back there again!",

They have a great selection of wine and craft beer from local breweries, as well as a coffee bar by day and bar at night!   The breakfast selection is great! We had breakfast sandwiches when we first went, but could easily order one of everything! The inside is chill too, some outdoor seating available too. Parking can be tough but it's worth it!  There is also a great lunch menu!! I would highly recommend this place for any part of the day or even to just sit back and relax!",

    "text": "This place is interesting. Came in to try their deli with my colleague for lunch. We checked out the menu online and were intrigued by the all-day breakfast.  I had the avocado toast, which is made off wheat toast, guacamole, tomato, red onion, over easy egg, cilantro and added the country ham as protein. It's a $2 upcharge, but I wanted to off-set the sweet guacamole with salty ham.  It was delicious. It fails to say that it is an open-faced sandwich. So make sure you take some utensils with you or things can get messy.  Also added the soup of the day, which was a mushroom and leek chowder. The soup was good, creamy, like you want a chowder to be. And got zappops chips (made in NOLA)...get the Voodoo ones! Any of the 2...love love love  My coworker had the chicken salad sandwich which is made of chicken salad, glazed pecans and red grapes with lettuce, tomato on a brioche bun. She swears by that brioche bun - her guilty pleasure. She also added a soup of the day (they had 2 plus the daily chili). She had the mexican beans soup. Which she loved as well.  Overall the menu was great. I was split between the avocado toast and the morning rancheros. Definitely will try that next time.  They still have a lot of kinks to work out. The layout of the \"Market\" is all over the place. It's very sparse and you have to go from \"station to station\". I'm from new york, so i'm used for things to be more crammed and within arms reach. I think it was more the flow of the space. The cashier did note that she wasn't sure where the home made cookies ought to be. They were at the \"market register\" and I'd suggest them to be by the coffee bar, as you would want something sweet most likely with you brew.  Also odd was that after ordering / getting our food from the deli (all the way in the back) we had to get water at the bar (all the way in the front). With our hands full with our food, we had to walk a lot before getting seated. I wonder if they can serve water from the deli directly. I can understand going to the bar for coffee or beer. They do have soft drinks available in the fridges next to the deli.  They have unique edible goods to purchase, artisan beers, local and international (I'm German, so I appreciated the made-in-germany hefeweizen in a bottle, just like home!) The feature local brews on tap and bottle / cans as well as two-scoop creamery ice cream (YAY! - get the cookies by the sea!)  Lots of space for sitting and chillin, do some work, lots of outlets. there were a few people meeting, for what i guess work. I didn't check the wifi, but it must be good with the amount of people that were there.  Definitely going back to try more of their menu and hopefully they will figure out a better flow of the space in the meantime. Perhaps update my review on their improvements. They just opened and I hope they are there to stay, because the food and the concept are great.",

They have a great variety of beverages inside and the place is clean. It was a very welcoming environment and our drinks were delicious.   I had a beer named \"Bootycall\" and my wife had some sort of blueberry cider. They were both great. Next time we'll try some of the food options.   Speaking of options. Aaron Rodgers did all that complaining in the off season and ended up getting a new contract that makes him the higest paid QB in the NFL. But he ain't making NBA money. I mean good for him, he will be able to finally shop at the same stores as Mike Conley.   I guess. But with the wear and tear on the human body that comes from NFL football is it worth it? Who wants to risk CTE for the same money that the 16th best point guard in the NBA makes?   Aaron Rodgers I guess. What a world. I bet when NBA players see him out at the club they call him \"Broke boy.\"   \"Ah there he go... old broke @ss Aaron Rodgers. Someone better pick up his tab for him. He probably want to split the check with his broke self!\"   Ain't that a trip?",

It is placed on a warm, moist, fluffy biscuit with an egg and sausage gravy on top. A nice hearty meal. My husband enjoyed his food as well. I tasted his waffle. It was warm and fluffy with a kiss of sweet. It comes with a honey cream sauce of which he thoroughly enjoyed.   The vanilla dirty chai (half coffee/ half chai tea) was the best I have ever had! It came in a cute mug with a crafty foam design on top.   Those guys behind the counter definitely know what they are doing!  The place is clean and the people are friendly.

The space is huge and there's plenty of seating around the place. It's a very open concept but set up in a way that it feels like there's different areas. I ordered just a hot coffee and an amazing breakfast sammy and took some baked goods to go for later.

    "text": "We love the concept and every employee we interacted with was awesome. The menu looked promising and we decided on a chicken biscuit, soda and water. The water bottle was small and $2, which seemed crazy to me. Other stuff was more pricey than I'd expected but I'm willing to pay extra to support local businesses. Aquafina, however, is not a local business so I wasn't feeling that price.   We sat down after ordering our food and were surprised at how quickly our name was called. When we tastes our food, we realized why - our sandwich was luke warm, at best. I went up to the counter for hot sauce (because I believe Texas Pete makes everything better) and noticed an employee bringing a bowl of cooked chicken from the back and setting it on a warmer in the front of the kitchen. I realize this is probably why our chicken wasn't hot - it had been sitting there, premade before we ordered. I would've rather had a few minutes longer of a wait and had hot food that was cooked to order. The taste was okay but not stellar and the biscuit fell apart. When we were finished, the bottom of the container looked like we had literally crumbled up the entire biscuit into small pieces. I think this biscuit could be great if it were executed better.   We will be back to buy local products but will probably wait awhile to revisit the deli again.",

    "text": "I'm so happy The People's Market opened up. We need more places that emphasize community and TPM really does that. First off, it's HUGE. There is so much room. Lots of different seating options. I like that the coffee and food are separate, so some people can sit at the bar and others can order food and sit down. There are retail items for purchase all around - an extensive beer collection, wine, snacks, ice cream - you name it. At the bar, they have coffee (including nitro cold brew, my fave!) and beer and possibly kombucha on tap. Plenty of vegan milk options.   Then you head to the back where you can order food. You can pick up a pre-prepared meal or order something hot. They have a variety of options - nothing wildly healthy or super inventive but all very solid. My one big gripe is everything is served in to-go containers: why? Doesn't make sense to me.   Whether you're looking to catch up with friends over a sandwich or sit for a while on your computer with a coffee, TPM has a spot for you!   Oh, and there's a little patio outside too!",

Upon arriving we were pleased to see they have their own covered parking garage which is free! The place is very nice with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. You can place your order at the bar or the kitchen.   The staff was very friendly and started us off with two amazing Lavender Vanilla Iced Coffees  but it didn't end there. I ordered the Chicken Biscuit thinking what the hell you can't go wrong and if you've had one chicken biscuit you've had them all. Well I was very wrong! This was easily the best chicken biscuit I've ever had! The biscuit was so soft and fluffy and the souther Fried Chicken was crispy and very flavorful accompanied by some delicious sausage gravy and scrambled eggs.    Hands down the best I've had! I'm definitely coming back and I recommend you give them a try, you won't be disappointed.",

There is a covered outdoor patio with picnic table like seating. There are some great local products and beverages available. However, my dropping of stars is for the vegan food.   It's tough to be a vegan in an omnivore world, so when restaurants have a whole separate section for vegan choices it gets exciting- as lame as it sounds.   The upsetting part about this review is both times I have purchased the food, for me it is just subpar. Most recently I had the Latta Good Stuff. I ordered it online and said to add avocado, which they did not. Additionally the bread was supposed to be toasted and it wasn't, resulting in a crumbling mess. Finally, the amount of ingredients to bread ratio is extremely off. The humus was a minimal amount of spread, definitely not enough to even cover the bread and get the flavor . There was one piece of tomato, one piece of lettuce, etc. just not enough to give me flavor. I tasted more bread than anything. If they just bulk up the ingredients and make it worth it, I'll be so happy to support this nice market. But I need to enjoy my food!   I'll keep trying, but please improve the vegan dishes.",

They've got pre-packaged foods, snacks, and a full kitchen putting out sandwiches, salads, and breakfast foods (all day!).  We happened to show up on $3.50 pint night, which was fantastic. It's so refreshing to go out for drinks in a trendy neighborhood and only spend $7 (plus tip). They have a decent selection of local and national craft beer, but don't go expecting 20 taps of every style imaginable. They also do not have a full bar, if you're looking for that.  I really enjoyed their Superfood Salad. I firmly believe that salads should have as many ingredients as possible, and People's Market delivered. From avocado to craisins to soba noodles, this salad packed a punch! The cool salad and cold beer were the perfect antidote on an (extremely) humid night after an (extremely) hot yoga class.  Shoutout to the Carolina Honey Sriracha chips - they are delicious! I've never seen them anywhere else before and was pleased to find a regional good on the shelves of People's Market.  Will definitely visit again when I'm back in the neighborhood.",

I was stuffed afterwords...just like the burrito. I highly recommend for breakfast!  Lunch also had a great selection. I had a turkey sandwich with tomato and sriracha mayo (not spicy but had good flavor). I saw they have salads but didn't try any. If you don't like what they offer, you can build your own.   One of the best parts about The People's Market is the array of local foods stocked on the shelves. Love the local support! Aside from the shelves, they have a bar with a bunch of local beers on tap.  Overall, a great, clean, modern space to gather with friends to come by yourself and have a beverage and something to eat. Fair warning, they food takes a little while to come out, so don't swing by if you're in a massive rush. I'm sure I will be here multiple times a week and will be cleaning them out of pimento cheese and beer.",

Quick in and out, the deli (where you order food) is loacated at the back of the market. I parked on the street, I thought I was lucky to find a spot, but later found out there is a garage below the market that has ample parking!   I came in again today with a group of co-workers to work on a presentation for work. We were able to snag a larger table for the 6 of us and everyone enjoyed their meals! The deli can be a little pricey and each item is a la carte, so it adds up if you want a lot of side items. The avocado chicken sandwich has been my go-to both times and I have yet to be disappointed! The group I was with was happy about the parking garage, the table was big enough for all our laptops and papers, the noise level wasn't too high, and the food was good!   Definately recommend for a working lunch if you are in the area! Maybe next time I will venture out of my avocado chicken sandwich!",

Gifts, beer on tab, full coffee menu with local coffee available, moderate size snack collection with the popular health conscious items , beer can fridge and shelves of wine bottles , deli that serves breakfast all day and a good amount of table and bar seating .   They've got drink specials and food specials. I tried and recommend the fried chicken ( breast) and waffle. There is a neat little cream they give you that come solid, but melts perfectly on you waffle or chicken and is really unique, sweet and tasty.",

The bartender was very friendly and was able to explain their drink selections (as there was some I haven't heard of). There are extra food selections to choose from around the restaurant such as baked chips, drinks, ice cream, etc. I highly recommend this place to any newcomer looking for a good brunch or lunch place.",

    "text": "After moving to closer to Dilworth I've passed this place on numerous occasions and never actually stopped by and just made a mental note to visit later.  I met a friend for a business meeting and we decided to meet here. Charlotte has plenty of \"markets\", each with it's on clientele and niche. I enjoyed the modern take here. We have enough divey, bodega like places but this is truly a great take on the concept. You walk in and can pick whether to shop for goods, grab a bite to eat or order from the full bar. The drinks are reasonably priced and the food is great! The portions are just right. I typically order the chicken and waffles. Two boneless chicken breasts and a nice sized waffle priced at $9! There's plenty of natural lighting, an outdoor patio and indoor seating, The bar is massive and a great focal point here.   Some big pluses here:   1) There's free parking inside the garage for the venues including The People's Market 2)   My only gripe here is the space's size hinders the food pickup process. Once you place your order, it isn't as natural to go pick up something to drink or order from the bar since the bar and seating is so far from the kitchen. It isn't uncommon to miss your name being called. I know there isn't anything that they can do in this situation, it just takes away from the fluidity here.   I'd still recommend this place to anyone as TJ, the guy with locs, makes you feel right at home. The rest of the staff is friendly and willing to help in anyway possible as well.   Two thumbs up over here!",

This would be a great place to come do work - not too loud and plenty of tables inside and out.   I had the Salmon BLT without bacon and it was delicious! The bread was perfect and the salmon wasn't fishy at all. Loved the addition of sprouts.   The sides are al a carte - I tried the cucumber salad and pasta salad. The cucumber salad was light and refreshing and likely vegan. The pasta salad was tasty but noting to write home about.   My husband got the Vegan Burger - Beyond Meat patty w arugula, Dijon and grilled mushrooms and onions - very tasty!    Your order your food at the deli in the back and start a tab. Then go to the bar to order coffee or wine/beer. Then they'll call your name to pick up your food at the back deli.   Love that you can buy beer to take home and make your own 6 pack!",

I've been racking my brain trying to remember what fancy restaurant died here...but no matter... The People's Market is a much better fit for the space and a great addition to The Dilworth neighborhood.  The space a has a great flow to it even though it's sectioned for different functions - it just makes sense. We came after dinner for a drink one evening and sat out on their patio. In the immortal words of Tonya P, \"Wanna drink retail?\". The answer is \"Yes, please.\" Here you can get a bottle of wine, bubbly or beer. If that's not your cup of tea, they have a huge bar with beer on taps or actual tea or coffee or a Matcha Latte - you get the point.  At the back is a deli with Breakfast and Lunch menus that will make your mouth drool. Don't worry though because the deli is open and serving lunch items until 9PM.  Long Live the People's Market!",

A bloggers event was held here that i was invited to if it wasn't for that once again i would have never known this small hidden gem existed. Parking is right off on the side of peoples market in a good sized parking deck. The fact that the peoples market is surrounded by other eatery's and fun things to do is a plus. I could have just had a field day walking up and down the side walk. As i entered i notice all the people outside on the patio eating,drinking and having a jolly time.   When you walk in it is a very large amount of space. I didn't know where to go first. The set up is like a convenient store but of coarse way bigger. Almost like the perfect one stop shop where you can order sandwich's, they have a bakery, a cool spot towards the back to buy wine and so much more that i didn't get a chance to explore. The bloggers event sponsored us food here so i will have to come back and try out peoples markets goodies. Perfect name for this spot by the way",

Food: I've recently had the People's market salad and added chicken salad on it. Overall, this is a large salad. Veggies were fresh and crispy. Now, I am a little picky about my chicken salad but this was pretty good. Large chicken chunks and light mayo. I've also had the chicken biscuit. I ordered it as it comes, but it the future I would add pimento cheese and maybe some lettuce. I didn't love the mayo on it.  The nitro cold brew is awesome! Served in a pint glass and coming in around $4.75-ish.   There is a large beer and wine selection in the store area. Some chips to choose from to go along with your meal. Overall, a place I will return!",

What softens the blow is that there are few businesses I'd rather give my hard-earned money to. Everything about this place is perfect. The atmosphere, the food, THE STAFF. Oh my God, I love the staff so much. They're friendly, they're funny, they remember me and treat me like a friend.   Food is solid, cheap, consistent. I love that they offer gluten-free bread. Not sure what else I can say - I've never had a bad meal here.   The bar is awesome, whether you're looking for a mimosa or a cold brew coffee (hint: look for the cold brew coffee - it's the best, creamiest, and most potent I've ever had).

The ambiance is great, the store has an open concept with self serve areas to order/pick up food and drinks. The staff was still very hands on however, making sure you are ok and seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and helping customers!   I had the carnitas rancheros and I must say it was amazing! The carnitas were cooked perfectly, crispy yet soft and flavorful. It's hard to explain how the perfect carnitas melts in your mouth, but these do just that. The black bean, corn and pepper relish was awesome, over easy egg cooked perfectly and the salsa and avocado were the perfect compliments. (I added shredded cheddar and sour cream to mine).  I also had the hash browns and they were great as well. I'll definitely be back!",

Lots to love:  Free parking in the hidden parking deck under the building (or on the street I guess too if you are gambler).  Ice cream, smoothies, hot food, alcohol AND coffee.  Ample indoor and outdoor seating - dog friendly patio.  Great place to come with a friend or two and hang out or get work done for a bit.  Lotttttsss of space - you won't feel cramped here.  The food is solid - its not the brunch dreams are made of but it will do as it seems like a crowd pleasing location.",

The prices are also a plus, considering an impossible burger somewhere else may cost $15+, this place is a gem. They need to work on their faux bacon considering all the other options out there, but I'm impressed! I hope they keep adding more plant based options for us grass eating folk. ;)  Another thing to note that needs improvement is the plastic waste. Food is served in plastic trays, plastic utensils, plastic everywhere... what's up with that? The planet is in distress and we need real silverware!  Also, all smoothies come prepackaged?? So you can guarantee that they aren't fresh. You also can't switch out anything such as whey, which is disappointing because that makes only the green smoothie non-dairy. If you're allergic to something, too bad.",

Vegan burritos and beyond meat burger. The only down fall is the lack of gluten free breads. But it's cool .   The coffee menu is amazing and the beers on tap are equally as good! Beer. Local Coffee.

The only issue I had is they seem to trying to determine if they want a Diner or a market? Food Was good I had the breakfast burrito and the wife had the Juevos Rancheros and it comes on a hamburger bun (I thought this was a food no no, put it on a bagel or in a wrap like everyone else does, Just makes more sense.) and the wife did not eat the bun. They have ice Cream, Coffee, Food, Groceries and free wifi. If you live in one of the apartments or home in or around the area this would be very convenient to shop and eat at,  but if you live elsewhere in Charlotte, too many other places to eat, with better parking and food. Still a great idea.",

When placing the order it was hard to hear because it was loud in the back. I understand that is hard to control, but it was slightly frustrating .We order two sides of hash browns, the market bagel, and the breakfast burrito with bacon.  Everything was lacking flavor. The hash browns were extremely soft and tasted like they had pounds of Oil on them. The breakfast burrito and the market bagel were both underwhelming. It was almost as if they did not put the basics of salt and pepper on it.  I tried to add more flavor with hot sauce but it was a fail. I was very upset to have wasted my money on something that lacked flavor.  The restaurant itself was cute but we ordered was missing a serious wow factor.",

Came here tonight and got something to eat and my Mom and I both ordered margaritas, one spicy and the other regular (both listed on the cocktail menu). After about 10 minutes they brought us the drinks. They were a red color and I asked what was in them to make them that way? They seemed to be confused when I noted this was a Bloody Mary not a margarita. They had made two bloodys both with orange and margarita garnishes. They eventually said they did they would remake them and we could keep the others if we wanted. We took one but as it was 8pm I didn't really want it not to mention it's not what I ordered. We sat down and they brought us one margarita and started to walk away and I stopped them to ask if the other would come out. They clearly had no intention of making the second and went back to do it and brought it out finally...as a margarita with olives. Very strange as I feel like these are two very basic drinks.",

From the cheery, yellow decor to the open seating and awesome playlist, once you find a spot you will not want to leave. And leaving is something you won't have to worry about for a few hours.  You can start your morning off with a latte, tea, or any of the other specialty drinks along with something off of their breakfast menu (which they serve all day). After the morning hours have passed, you can transition into lunch with a cold beverage (such as a kombucha or bottled iced tea) from their refrigerated sections and a salad or sandwich. Then, after you've put in all can work-wise, you can cap off of your day with a margarita shaken up right at the bar. That's right, the same area where you picked up your morning latte is also where you can be served a margarita on the rocks.  Talk about a FULL-SERVICE BAR, FOLKS.  My only recommendation? Try everything.",

    "text": "Finally made it over to People's Market and Dilworth for a breakfast meeting and was glad we chose this place. There's parking nearby which is great and it was easy to find. The place is very spacious with all the knick knacks of a market, along with a bar and a deli. The decor was chic and the vibe fit the neighborhood well.  For breakfast I went with the chicken biscuit. This is no ordinary chicken biscuit! It is huge with 2 chicken breast and eggs topped with gravy. It was delish and filling! I also had a mimosa which they made fresh so of course it was great. They also had a dj playing some old school tunes which added to the vibe. I'm a fan of People's Market.",

This place is a work space, restaurant, bar, coffee shop, and convenience store all rolled into one place.   They offer local products, like Green Brothers Juice, which I enjoy.  They have fresh baked goods from local companies also. The food that they serve is amazing. I've had almost everything from the Chicken and Waffles to the Vegan burger.  Everything they cook has been great! TIP: the chicken here is cooked to perfection. Let's not forget the drinks that they serve. They are know for their RUMmosa made with freshly squeezed juice. You just can't get any better then that.   I would recommend this place is you need a workspace, to have a small meeting, or just come to eat. Don't just take my word for it try it out!!",

The staff is super friendly, they have outdoor seating and  a variety of indoor seating options, food and plenty of random  things to purchase. I fell in love with the whole vibe after being about to buy a bottle of wine and have a glass (or two) while I worked. And I don't think they charge anything extra if you do. Also, I usually go and get a dessert from the deli.   This was the first time I purchased food or ordered a drink. I ordered a rumosa and chicken and waffle. The chicken and waffle was good but the sauce that comes with it was DELICIOUS!   I wish they had more indoor seating because it can get busy but my only real issue with coming here is parking. Depending on the time of day, it can be hard to find.   Would I go back? Absolutely, I've probably been back 2 or 3 times since this visit!",

I was in the mood for biscuits and gravy and when I came across this, it amplified my craving. The outer crumbles from the fried chicken had a nice salty crunch which was perfect between bites of the warm chicken meat, egg and gravy. Loved the fluffy warm biscuit. Huge fan of this dish. Got a blueberry cream muffin on the side. Would have liked some more gravy action, definitely recommend requesting extra.",

I placed my order quickly, making sure not to interrupt the order taker's breakfast. When it comes up it's missing its side. I inquire and now a different team member informs me that my side is in the self service cooler, and I could help myself. This place is to big and confusing to be successful. I think they are trying to be an ultra upscale common market, well they aren't even close. Every restaurant in the spot has failed, and this one will be no different.",

The place feels cold and unwelcoming; the staff were taking to each other and I felt as though I was interrupting. My latte was cold and sweet and there was nothing personable about my interactions with the barista. Again; felt like I was interfering on his morning. After buying a $6 juice and $17 almond butter (seriously!??) we checked out the breakfast options. Deli sandwich was terrible quality; greasy, cold, sloppy. Would return to buy wine and cheese but would like to see some improvement in the customer service aspect. Concept is great and has some real potential!",

But what we got is an IKEA market. It's stark and not welcoming and the aluminum barstools are so uncomfortable (so much for hanging out with friends). Everyone in the neighborhood with a work from home gig, and every PTA mom who has breakfast and/or lunch committee meetings (I identify with both categories) was anxiously awaiting somewhere besides Mayobird to eat while meeting. The food quantity and price point doesn't make up for the lack of ambiance or personality. The space is so huge and has so much potential. Right now it's a drafty cement slab with tons and tons of unused space and no character. I'm rooting for it to adjust to the hood, but Dilworth deserves more than what The People's Market is currently offering.",

I'm left wondering if they rushed to open before they had the store fully stocked.  You only get once chance to make a first impression.  I walked in asking myself, \"are they really open?  where is everything?\"  It's heavy on beer and wine but not much else.  How about lots of healthy snack options and non-alcoholic beverages like various types of kombucha? The lunch menu is ok but it would be nice to have non-processed protein options like chicken breast, natural unprocessed turkey breast, salmon, etc.  I'm in no rush to return unless I hear that they've filled the store out with more choices.  I'm not suggesting you need to clone Rhino or Common Market but perhaps walk through and get some ideas, otherwise People's Market is just too limited.",

While I fully support the enthusiasm, it's hard to execute all those components well and keep everything cohesive. Ordered a sandwich, coffee, and bottle of water from three different parts of the place. That order would have been frustrating if this place was busy at all.  My sandwich order got lost (it happens from time to time NBD) but the sandwich, 10$ club, didn't make it worth the wait or the price. Coffee wasn't anything I'd go out of my way for either. There was almost nothing on the shelves to purchase which made the convenience store part seem pretty much useless. Seating was great though.  I'll probably give this place another shot but I'll have to have a game plan first. I think I'll do a hitch route for a coffee then run a post for a breakfast sandwich in the back. Celebrate with a beer if all goes well.",

    "text": "The People's Market is akin to Charlotte success stories such as Common Market and Rhino Market, but it definitely has it's own (Dilworth) vibe going. All of the employees are friendly and helpful. The food does take a while but they just opened yesterday. We ordered two sandwiches and there were two individual people in front of us but it took about 15-20 minutes to get our order. That being said, the club and the BLT were top notch. They have a great wine and beer selection. I did not try the coffee but will be coming back for one soon. Looking forward to more visits here in the near future!",

Everyone was so helpful considering we had no idea what to do and they took the quick minute to make us feel at home. For anyone else who hasn't been here, pick a station to start at and give them a card.  This will open a tab for you across all stations so you can go to hot food for example, order food open a tab, then go over to drinks/bar order there while you are waiting for your food and either keep open or close out your tab with everything totaled one time. Great place great vibe, super people. Thanks for a great first impression.",

I haven't had a bad sandwich yet and I've had about 6 different options (breakfast and lunch). The atmosphere is very inviting and is great for everyone. However, the large open areas and organization of the market  is confusing. They do not serve iced coffee unless you want to pay $5+ for a nitro cold brew or pay for a cup of ice. Overall, I enjoy coming to this place often but there is definite room for improvement.",
