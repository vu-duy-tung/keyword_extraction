I generally order the large Greek salad with Gyro meat $6.95. They could easily charge $9.95 for this portion. I order an extra side of gyro meat $2.50 and it is a feast that quenches my XL appetite at dinner time. Order whatever you like...it all looks great!",

It is a fun place to go for a casual lunch and I would definitely recommend it. My only word of caution is to stay away from the chicken tenders because they are frozen and not worth the money.",

This is the fast food equivalent of Olive Garden doing Italian, Olive Garden isn't fast food but it also isn't Italian.  Showmars is fast food but its take on Greek isn't really Greek.  I still eat here because it is cheap and close enough.  Don't expect to rave about the tzatziki sauce.  That is what keeps this place from being a 4, and almost got it a 2.  The tzatziki  misses all the flavor notes I really want.  I only ever go here for carryout lunch.  It was a huge hit at the doctor's office I used to work at.  The people were blessed Southern folk but had no idea what Greek food could or should taste like so they found it happy.  If you haven't ever really had great Greek food then this place will work just fine.  I haven't had great Greek food anywhere outside of Europe and New York City . . . yet.  I want to find my Charlotte Greek place and until I do I will pretend Showmars is Greek as a way to keep me from losing hope.",

The Greek-american cuisine of Showmars is fantastic. From great salads, pitas, and fish plates, you will more than likely find something that more than suites your needs.  The food is great. The prices are modest. Service is generally pretty decent but this place will get crowded at times. I would love this place more if they didn't charge you for ranch dressing. I swear that stuff is like an addiction. If you are a fan of ranch- BEST RANCH I'VE EVER TASTED. But only good at SHOWMARS RESTAURANTS, not in the mall. For whatever reason they dilute the dressing in the mall. Burger pitas and fries are awesome!   Overall, I can appreciate a lot about Showmars, and can ALWAYS count on a good meal there. Free drink refills are always good too.",

Maybe it's because this city is overflowing with places to fill your belly and even though we do get home cooking around here, it's just been all kinds of fun to sample the local goods.  We are loyal Showmars customers. The food is decent and similar to what we'd cook at home: comforting and no surprises.  I like meeting my husband here for lunch (he loves the fried fish sandwich smothered in tartar sauce), taking my daughter here for a bite when we're done at the library, or going for dinner when we're all in the mood.  My daughter loves the chicken strips meal with fries. Or the grilled cheese with fries.  I'm partial to the fried fish sandwich, the Calabash shrimp meal, the grilled chicken sandwich, and the sweet tea.

Example, if ordering delivery pizza - I will search for a local pizza joint than a common chain like Domino's or Papa Johns.  I did, however, eat at Showmar's to meet up with a friend and it was my first time eating there.    Pro's:  convenience and speedy-quick in getting our meal; large selection of menu items/dinners; reasonable prices; large portions, so good quantity for the price.  Con's:  the food quality was what brings the rating down...  my friend ordered his \"regular\" a lamb gyro dinner.  Sorry... the lamb did not look appetizing.  It look liked dried processed meat.  Reminds me of the movie \"Bridesmaids\", LOL.  I ordered the seafood platter and I knew it was fried but I didn't experience the sea-smell so I was quite confident that that the fish was not spoiled.  I believe the fish was flounder but it was quite thin - well, actually VERY thin.  At least they didn't overcook it.  And baby shrimp.  OK, I'll accept it.  But I would have been more impressed if the shrimp was larger.  Coleslaw was questionable... not sure how old it was... the mayo seemed kinda \"sticky\".  Husband ordered the tenderloin dinner.  We were advised that it was not beef but pork.  I recommend that they specify that on the menu.  It was \"ok\", but quite tasteless (not marinated).  Overall, for a quick/convenient inexpensive meal, it \"filled the hole\".",

Went here for Saturday lunch, and all the employees were really warm and welcoming.  Our food in particular was actually pretty delicious for what it was. I ordered the Souvlaki Pita, and the pork was just a tad overdone, but the flavor was all there and proportion of ingredients was spot on. Their pita really is pretty damn good.   I don't have too much to say about a fast food place, but I left happy and full. As for the health aspect that I think everybody is harping on, it all seems to depend on what you order. I think I lucked out by getting one of the healthier options, but there seems to be a ton you can indulge on here (ahem, my mother ordering the banana pudding...)",

Was overwhelmed by their extensive menu, and they seem to be known for their burger in a pita (forgot what it's called). However, I was craving gyro meat, so got the gyro dinner plate which came with a side salad, pita, gyro meat, sauce, french fries, and a drink! It was about $10. Very quick in service, and I had 2 boxes to take with me to go! Tons of gyro meat, but it was a bit dry. Their pita is really good, I think they fry it, giving it that extra yumminess. I ended up making my own gyro with the veggies from the salad. Their fries were the crinkle cut kind, and it was good, but way too much! I couldn't even eat half my meal!  They have the special ice, which they put a ton of, which means getting a refill when you pick up your food! Staff are all very friendly and courteous as well. Casual greek food.",

The runners and manager are very hands on, they stop at your table every few minutes to see if you need anything including an endless refill of your beverage (the half lemonade/half ice tea aka Arnold Palmer is amazing). The atmosphere at Showmars is very nice and you won't miss the game, because they have wall to wall televisions streaming the hottest sports games.

The chicken pita is also great. We always stop here when we are through the area. This is a great place if your rolling through. Stop by and check it out.",

I asked for military discount and she was quick to say No. It always amazes me when I get a no without any reason. She was young this is a college town so I guess I will need to get use to lack of respect for soldiers. Place was clean the hello when you walk in is friendly and then it is straight to business with no personality. Maria thought it was more important to talk to her coworkers than take care of the customer.",

I didn't even want to try the Hush Puppies, and didn't finish my food. I didn't enjoy it.",

Friends ordered a fish sandwich and black bean salad and another ordered a grill chicken salad. Everyone enjoyed their meal but I think we were really pleasantly surprised at how many staff members stopped by to see if we needed anything or how they could help. Super friendly folks. Would definitely stop here for lunch if I'm around town.",

I've craved a grilled chicken chef salad in the taco bowl at least once a week and my husband always gives in to my craving! This location is always clean and the staff is always friendly. The food is served promptly and they have very reasonable prices!! Growing up, I would never eat their French fries, but within the past couple of years, they've changed the recipe or something and I now eat them before eating the rest of my meal! The remodel/renovation work has now created a more modern feel but with all of the traditional family favorites! When I'm not demolishing a salad, I go for the old-fashioned pita and fries and I'm pleased every time!! Give them a try!! I promise you will NOT be disappointed! They've also added new healthy options so there's something for everyone!",
