Until I saw the towers of brown paper bags and figured thats how I ordered. Weird I thought at first but hey, its original and that helps. I ordered roast beef, whole wheat toasted.   The sandwich was good, lacking somewhat in the meat department. But all the ingredients seemed fresh and it was brilliant of me to put horseradish and Dijon mustard on the sandwich.",

The Matthews location was new when I first tried this chain, so the service was super slow(understandable).  This location is well groomed and gets you in and out with your order being perfect.  With all the choices you get to pick or not pick, the speed is quite impressive!!  I would stress that if you are feeling indecisive, this won't be the best place to dine.  I don't like standing in a line and being rushed on my order so this place suits me perfectly with a brown bag and marker to stand and choose my pickins.  Black bean patty is DELISH!!!  Little heart burn after but so worth it!!  Everything is fresh and delicious and will have you craving it daily!!  They give a frequent customer punch card to earn a free sandwich and it doesn't take 20 punches like most places to earn one.  Go!  Go!  Go!!",

    "text": "Overall this is a pretty cool place with very good sandwiches.  I must have looked lost when I went in for the first time because the guy behind the counter patiently explained the process.  You pick a bag from a group (beef, pork, chicken etc.) then you check off what you want, things like a choice of mustard, cheese, types of other garnish, cold or toasted etc. Then you write your name on the bag and hang it up.  They were not very busy when I was there so the guy gave me a free drink and we chatted about the sandwiches and sides.  The price was right and my Cuban came out hot, crispy and very tasty.  The only issue I have is the downright horrible parking situation but that is not Which Wich's fault.  Just be aware, if you are in a hurry or easily frustrated, go somewhere else, even in a non-rush time (4:00 PM on a weekday) I had to go to the third level of the parking deck and it was agonizingly slow going.  Check them out if you have the time. They bring a whole new meaning to \"brown-bagging\"",

That being said, the sandwiches are just as tasty. Which Wich is quality product and it is because of that I am willing to wait, and to brave parking at the Met...on a Friday evening...on my way to the airport. So swing by when you have a (generous) few minutes. I suggest the gyro or black bean patty. And don't forget to load up on the olive spread.",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich from here and was pleasantly surprised how their operation works.  A little back-story: I was planning to go to the grocery store, but didn't want to go hungry and buy everything in sight, so I had originally wanted to grab a bite somewhere around Trader Joe's in the Metropolitan.  After almost dying in the parking deck for a spot, I was planning to walk to Chipotle when I saw this option and decided to give it a try.  So you walk in and it was fairly slow.  I was expecting a counter... maybe like subway where you go down the line and pick your toppings and what-not, but this was a bit different.  There are stands of brown bags and you go to the number kiosk that you want your sandwich to be based off of.  All the toppings you could ever want with that sandwich are listed and you take a sharpie and bubble in which toppings you want.  Pretty darn awesome.  When you are done taking your \"standardized test\" minus the number two pencils... hand the bag over to the cashier and she will ring it up.  After a couple of moments, (depending on what you ordered) the sandwich appears in the bag that you had marked on.  Genius!  I forgot all the toppings I had put on my sandwich but I got a hot pesto chicken sandwich [base] and it was pretty tasty.  The staff was super nice and also offered to help if I had any questions - they are probably nice cause they don't have to ask the same question(s) to everyone that comes in (whether it be \"hot, medium, mild salsa\", or \"what else would you like....\"... everything is written down on the bag and you save your breath or having to repeat yourself.  Happiness all around!",

    "text": "Man, this place is overwhelming on your first visit. You have to pick a bag for your sandwich that is all dependent on what category it's in (ie: turkey, ham, veggie etc). Once you process that there is an option for just about anything you could possibly want, you let your hands & a magic market get to work by completing the check-list on the bag of what ingredients you'd like on your sub.   Since it was my first trip to a Which Wich, I decided to go with their 'Signature' sandwich, The Wicked. It's Turkey, Ham, Roast Beef, Pepperoni, Bacon & 3 cheeses of your choice all deliciously piled together on your choice of bread (or lettuce wrap for those carb-counters of there). Pretty much any topping you could possibly want on a sub is there for an option at no additional charge, as is a plethora of dressings/sauces.   My only 'complaint' would be that they don't have a \"meal deal\" option like most other sandwich shops. If you want chips and a drink, you're paying separately for each item as everything is a la carte. Not a huge deal, but it's always nice to save a few pennies when you can. A small sub is big enough for the average eater and I believe most of them are $5.60.",

    "text": "Interesting concept, and might do alright because of location, but not really my \"bag\".  You walk up, you can barely see the open sign somewhat glowing through the window of this extremely new place.  You walk in, there is no one to take your order, but there is a whole bunch of bags and sharpies.  Hmmmm?  The idea is, you write on the bag what exactly you want, then hand it to them and pay.  Seems quicker/more efficient than the subway way, but much less personable.  Fits right in with this extremely busy Trader Joes and Best buy area.  I was not quick or efficient, I kind of just stared at the wall, looked around for a little bit, and then eventually began to write on my bag.  The place was clean, the lights were bright, and the Charlotte Observer was on the wall.  I was taking my mom out for a quick bite, so we just decided to share a sub when I noticed it was going to come out to over $11 for a 10\" sub, chips, and a drink.  She noticed a sign about an avocado turkey for only $1 more.  I went for it.  Turns out that avocado is $1.50 more, so over $12 for a medium combo and still had to buy another drink.  It came out relatively fast and its was good, but nothing special.  Kind of similar to Jersey Mikes if I had to compare to a mainstream chain.  The bag of \"house chips\" were decent.  Pretty small and a little over salted.  But the drinks oh wow.  They've got a tea machine that spits out 4 different kinds of tea.  2/3 green tea, with a splash of raspberry, truly the highlight of my outing.  All in all, I don't think I necessarily wasted my money going there, but for 2 people at lunch, I would have been just as going to the sushi buffet at Pisces, or even happy spending less money and getting 2 spicy chicken combo's at the Wendy's across the street.  Sorry which wich, maybe next time.",

This one is located at the Metropolitan area, so I know that people might complain about the whole parking situation.  If you're already shopping in this area, I highly recommend stopping by.  When you walk in, you'll be able to see the menu on the right-hand side.  Note to not stand in line just looking at the menu, you'll have to grab a brown paper bag to fill out your order!  I didn't know that, so I stood there for awhile until I finally realized what the dilly-o was.  Whew!  The staff is pretty nice.  The food is good.  ALL the times I've been there so far, I've only ordered the Buffalo Chicken wich.  Pretty good.  I can't seem to stray away from it.  Beware though, if you go right at lunch time, it'll take a while to get your order.  I learned to just go either early or later for lunch.    All in all...a nice place.",

With places like Subway, I always feel hurried into making my selections when there are people waiting in line behind me, but at Which Wich, you just pick out a bag, mark all the meats / veggies / sauces that you might want, put down your name and hand it to the servers.  Their buffalo chicken is really good, but that's the only thing I tried so I can't really say much about anything else in comparison. The veggies were really fresh and my sandwich was neatly wrapped up. I tend to be a messy eater, so I give extra points to anyone who wraps up sandwiches in a way that I don't get mayo down the front of my shirt.  Parking can get a little tricky since this is right in the middle of the Met area, and although I went here on a Saturday, I can imagine this place being really busy on weekdays during lunchtime.",

On today's visit (a Sunday around 12:30 PM - think church crowd), we had to park over by the boutiques & Pisces Sushi - in one of the 30 minute spaces...which we took ALL of that 30 minutes.  I absolutely adore their ordering system - pure genius! It's not like Subway; where you're behind someone who just can't decide on what all they want on their sandwich, all the while holding people up.   Because it was SO busy, it really did take about 15 minutes or more to actually get our food - & we were taking it \"to go\"! We ordered a regular rench dip (for me) & my boyfriend got the regular chicken cordon bleu.   In addition to the small space, the pluses are friendly employees & a clean space. Their prices aren't bad either. I love the insane amount of choices you have for ordering. So many combinations, but you can also order a \"set\" sandwich.  On to the food!  We got home & thankfully, my au jus made the trip successfully. It was still warm. :) Bread was just the right amount of \"toastiness\" (made that up!) & the roast beef was chopped up - which was odd to me, but it tasted REALLY good.  Add my Miss Vickie's jalapeno chips & I was one happy (& full) girl. Shawn was \"ok\" with this chicken cordon bleu - he (for some reason) wasn't expecting the chicken to be actual chicken lunch meat & not an actual fried piece of chicken. :D  Being in the busy Met area, it's safe to say this place will always be busy. Good luck!",

You grab a brown bag and fill out your order. Cool ! I chose the Banh mi and wanted to substitute the pulled pork for chicken but they informed me that the seasoning it's already mixed in the meat.  No big deal, I thought.  While waiting for my wich, I'm impressed by the wall of art ! so that's what you're supposed to do at which wich ! Got it ! I will bring out my artistic skills next time I'm here!  My Banh mi taste great, not your authentic Vietnamese banh mi but it's okay. Because it tastes good enough for a sandwich !  Fresh cilantro,cucumber and jalapenos!  Pulled pork is packed with flavor!  I can't wait to go back and try more sandwiches!!!",

When I ordered my food, I noticed that the cashier was processing a large catering order of turkey subs. So I guess that they mixed my sub up. It's funny that I have gone there and they are super busy and the get my order correct. Today I was the only person there and they mess up my order.",

And just the way you want it. You pick a brown bag that accompanies the type of meat that you want and proceed to use a sharpie to fill in the meat, cheese, toppings and spread. just the way you want it and in a cool way. They also have chips, cookies, rice krispy treats and shakes.   The sandwiches are very tasty and you can get a combo meal. They even do a punch card for frequent members for a free sub.   This location is relatively new and the staff is especially helpful. Each time I've gone in, once I enter, someone comes from behind the register to greet me and ask if I've been there before and am familiar with the process of ordering. That's very cool.   Prices are reasonable and the sandwiches are awesome. You definitely need to stop by and order a sandwich here.",

    "text": "Made it into this new location during a busy lunch hour to see what the buzz was all about. After seeing the other locations in town, the location at the Met was definitely a good spot for them to land.   First, being at The Met, you're in for a hell of a time finding a parking space. Next to impossible during a busy lunch hour or evening when everyone in Charlotte decides to shop at Trader Joe's. If you're lucky enough, snag a spot on the street for easy in and out of there. Not fun when you're on a time crunch for a meeting or getting back to the office.   The space inside is pretty small. Not hospitable for 50 hungry, business professionals from Uptown. Standing room is limited. Get ready to brush some shoulders!  The order system is hilariously fun. You mark your order on designated bags with red sharpies and then they hang them above the makeline! Really fun to watch. With my imagination and heart being that of my 4-year-old self, I really enjoyed this. It makes it fun to order what you want on the sandwich and not go with the cookie cutter choices like other sandwich shops.   The house chips are really good, too. Seasoned lightly and served in an innocuous paper bag. I appreciate that.   I ordered the chicken salad. I probably added way too many toppings, but it was good. A bit on the creamy side, but the bread was thick and chewy. It made up for the overt creaminess. The buffalo sauce they have is a nice addition! I'm sure it would be great on just about any sandwich they have there.   Pretty solid choice for lunch. Beware of crowds and parking crazies!",

    "text": "Have to start out by saying yum! I'm your basic turkey on white with mayo, lettuce and tomato girl. If I'm feeling frisky that day give me vinegar, oil and pickles. My fav chain sandwich place is Jersey Mikes, I like their bread and meat. Subway is a NO go and I've been way outdone on Jimmy John's. I've been wanting to try Which Wich because my BFF said it was pretty awesome. She was right. Walk in, get a bag, mark off what u want. Any picky person can be picky here, they'll accommodate you! They have some oddball stuff too for the brave palate. The turkey meat is fresh, Tatar just like Jersey Mike's. I got pickles and they were crisp and super yummy. My friend told me about their house chips and I grabbed a bag of those too. They have a unique flavor...which is a good unique flavor. They come in a bag that seems like they're made in house (as name would suggest) try them! If it's your first time u get a free large drink...that's pretty awesome to me! It comes in a refillable cup which if u bring back u save $.50 cents. Environmental friendly ;)  3 different sizes of sandwiches...I had a small which is 7 inches and only ate half to get full. It was $5.50 which I consider cheap compared to JJ's and Jersey Mikes. You can also create a salad bowl (not an option at JJ's) or a lettuce wrap (not an option at Jersey Mikes). The staff was also super nice and friendly. They great u as soon as u walk in the door and are really fast too. As soon as I fixed my drink my wich was ready. A lot of specials....one day is kids day, a day for medical staff, punch cards, etc.",

    "text": "Ya'll this location has got it going on! I have been to other Which Which stores, but they don't compare!   This location can get pretty busy, so they have worked out a system that has the customer write what they want on a pre populated paper bag that the finished product will go in. They have signature sandwiches on a special bag as well as other meat and veggie base bags. You simply write your name on the bag and pick out the ingredients.   This is different from other Which Which locations I have been to, so I was slightly confused at first, but figured it out quickly! The workers are super friendly and will help you out if it's your first time, just ask or go up to the register to order.   How to order a turkey reuban: I learned the easiest way to make the workers laugh is to use the turkey bag and make your own turkey sandwich and write in rye bread. The easiest way would be to fill out the reuban bag and cross off corned beef and add turkey. They definately got a kick out of my original method.   The sandwich was very very good and I would recommend. The amount of kraut to cheese and turkey was perfect and I got enough 1000 dressing to make my taste buds happy!   Pro tip: if you find parking on the street, you are very very lucky! The garage (on the target side) is the easiest place to park without getting road rage.",

    "text": "Ordered via online and the website gave me the option to deselect  mayo, carrots, and jalapeno.  I added in the comments NO egg and extra cumber instead. I ordered at 10 in the morning as soon as they opened. I left at the time the website stated the ordered would be ready. Got to the location, to pick up. I get there and still had to wait over 10 minutes for my order. I get back to my desk notice everything I said NOT to put on the which is there. I called and told maybe a lady who was the manager and she said she'd remake it, I told her twice I CANNOT EAT MAYO. She blamed they issue on the website and tried to make me believe the deselect options don't \"work\". Got there again and the lady was leaving to go outside, she told the employee to remake the order... they still put mayo on the which... he re-made it a 3rd time and forgot the cucumbers... At this point I was just done. 1st time customer and this was the worse experience ever.",

    "text": "I love a good sandwich (or as my fellow country folk say it \"sammich\")! Give me some soft bread with turkey and fresh veggies and I'm a happy lady. I had driven by Which Wich many times and always wanted to try it. So the opportunity came and I was...underwhelmed.   So the whole concept of writing your order on a bag is cool. I got a small turkey on wheat with a variety of veggies. I did the combo. I had read on Yelp that first time customers get a free drink. I inquired about it and was told they don't do this anymore. I asked about upgrading to a large drink but at that point, the employee already rang up my order. I asked if I could just pay the difference and he told me he couldn't \"because there's no button for that\". Okay. Whatever. Not the end of the world.   The sandwich was just okay. It was sort of sloppily made and a lot of my veggies just fell out of it. The bread was good but the rest was just average. Was it the best sandwich ever? Definitely not. Was it the worst sandwich ever? No. There's much worse. Maybe I need to give this another go but I certainly won't be in a hurry to return.",

    "text": "We came here after work...I was so happy that I found a which which running distance form work! I went out on a limb and ordered the shrimp banh mi sandwich for $7.50 instead of my regular black bean patty. I couldn't help myself and added a small vanilla malt shake.   The sandwich had great condiments and bread but I was disappointed with how soggy the breaded shrimp turned out. :( I was hoping for crispy shrimp like the picture portrayed. I ate it anyways...I was starved from a full day of work without food. The shake helped too..  I will be sticking to my black bean patty from now on. OOHHH, and if you have a punch card..theres DOUBLE PUNCH TUESDAYS! Score...Will be back, just not for the shrimp banh mi.",

    "text": "Oh hmm. Walking in here, seein bags with markers. Do I get to fill in bubbles like I did in school?! Why, yes. Yes I do. Now mind you, this place is definitely going to be hard if you're intoxicated, luckily I wasn't.  So I stroll up trying to figure out how to order and at the same time not being weird doing it. So I decide to get a French dip sandwich, get the bag to fill it out and then I say what the?!? What should I put in a French dip sub? I think mozzarella with pesto and caramelized onions with tomatoes, bell peppers, and mushrooms will do.  Now, if you think that's not a French dip sandwich, you're probably right. I like to think of it as if a cheese steak sub got it on with a French dip sub in the sandwich producing line, this oddly shaped overflowing sub comes out. This is the French cheese steak dip.  And the verdict. Awesome. As this restaurant goes along with that as well. I'll definitely come back here. The only downside to my 5 star recommendation is that it is a little pricey, but still...add on all those add ons and you're golden.",
