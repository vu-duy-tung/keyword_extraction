I had the chicken teriyaki bento box(A) with fried rice, and my husband had a sushi bento box (B).  They both came with miso soup to start, and it was so delicate and flavorful, with the teeeeniest cute mushrooms in it. Our waitress (pronounced \"Hat\") offered to refill our bowls, and I was tempted, but knew I had plenty of food coming. Both boxes had a salad with ginger dressing, and mine had two gyoza and sauce and sauteed veggies under the chicken.  The fried rice tasted a little different from any I've had - in a good way!  We look forward to going back and trying more interesting things!",

Excellent service, food tastes delicious (just like all of their other locations). We sampled a sweet, bubbly Sake called Mio that was awesome. And I honestly have tried Sake and it was always too strong. This was perfect. All of staff worked together to make us feel welcome and at home. The kids loved the chicken and salmon teriyaki dishes, so it is a great place for families. Beautiful presentation for the dishes. Great Friday night in Waverly.",

Then a very rude guy got on the line and with attitude said that room only hold 10 plus it's already taken. I said no worries we will just take a table. He then replied not at 7:30 that is prime time and we would have to move tables for your group. He asked if we could just come in on Sunday. What a jerk. He then replied well if your group would come in at 6 and could be done for prime time around 7:30 he might be able to assist our group. I will never be back and hopefully management lets him go on Sunday. Yama in Waverly- Charlotte NC",

The sashimi is always fresh and has no fishy smell or taste.  They are sure to let you know if they have any specials.  Try the fatty tuna.  It will melt in your mouth.  Be sure to ask for recommendations.  They have a large selection of sashimi and quite a few that others may not.       Give them a shot and you will not be disappointed.

Service was attentive and quick, expect long waits on Friday & Saturday and congested parking, Waverly Park it's crazy packed almost every day. You can order take out and the portions are pretty decent, I was informed by the hostess that they will add pick up parking spaces.   I personally think the bar attendant could be a bit more attentive, we waited for a while just to make some eye contact for an order and the bar wasn't busy at at all, we did get to order but we never made eye contact ha ha, too busy cleaning and multitasking no big deal really.

Tonight was supposed to be a nice date night where my girlfriend was going to try sushi for the first time. Unfortunately rather than sitting down for a delicious meal, we were served a dish of being stuck in the bathroom for hours on end. We did notice something tasted slightly off and we notified our waiter who then took it off our bill. However, this did not justify the horrific experience we had to endure afterwards. If you want a fresher-tasting, better prepared, and better presented sushi dish, there's no need to look further than your local Harris Teeter.",

I live right near this place and was planning to go a bunch because of the convinence- will not be going back.",

Had to flag 3 different people down for refills on drinks, napkins, to order desert, and finally after watching our server stand at the sushi bar for 15 minutes while we were waiting for our check I had enough. No table awareness whatsoever . To the point I almost said something to the manager but chose to reflect my feelings in the tip (flat 10%). I hate to do that because I was in the restaurant business for 15+ years, but get a clue dude.   When you're paying $250.00+ for a table of 4, you better step it up. I'll go back, but was not a great first impression.",

They have a large assortment of fresh fish and the quality of food is amazing. Some of my favorites are: the platter for 2, the magic roll, the teriyaki chiken (I usually don't like chiken but this is super flavorful and light and crispy), the nigiri assortment, California roll, yaki udon, green tea cheesecake, and their lunch bento boxes. I love everything I try there!",

    "text": "First time to Yama. I said I wanted to have a glass of wine and take out sushi. The hostess pointed me to the bar (right beside the host station) and said they could take care of me. But there were no seats at the bar (which she could have seen if she looked.) I came back to the host station and one of the other hosts, noting my confusion, escorted me to the sushi bar. Once I got there - smooth sailing!   One of the sushi chefs immediately greeted me and a server also greeted me and helped me with the menu. While I was perusing the menu, the server showed me the list of special fish available - all sounded marvelous. I decided on The Waverly, from the menu, which involved salmon and tempura shrimp. While I enjoyed my glass of wine waiting on my order, the sushi chef handed me a complimentary portion of lovely salmon nigiri since I was new to Yama.   Shortly thereafter, the server brought me my take out order. All in all it was a nice visit. I will say however that when one takes out sushi, one loses a major part of the sushi experience. Opening a plastic clam-shell container to find the pieces of sushi more or less crammed inside is just not the same as enjoying the appearance of a lovely plate in the restaurant. But again - my decision!",

The dumplings are flavorful and they have steamed pork inside.  For lunch entree I ordered the salmon teriyaki which was a generous portion. They serve it with stir fried vegetables and a scoop of rice with a nice salmon steak.  I found the flavors wonderful and just the right combination of sweetness and salty teriyaki. I hear good things about their sushi so will try it in the future. They were busy with lunch but had good service. Parking is very busy so I parked in the Waverly deck (by the Hilton) and walked to the restaurant.",

Our server was very attentive and we liked his personality.  The only thing that was frustrating was when my dish came out about ten minutes before my lunch companion's did. This is always awkward.  Even though she said, \"ah go ahead and don't wait for me\", it still feels really weird and rude being the only one eating.  At the same time, you realize that your food is getting COLD.  It's the restaurant's job to make sure dishes are better timed and come out together.   Otherwise, a good experience.",

IMHO, this place competes with sushiyas in Hawaii, and is better than most of the places I've been to in LA, SF and Manhattan. Also, the miso soup is exceptional; you can really tell that they care about their dashi. My family says their cooked food and rolls are excellent too, but I go straight for the nigiri every time because Robin is the master. Always ask about their specials, and make sure you get the kinmedai whenever it's available. My other favorites are hirame (get it with the shiso leaf) and ikura (the lemon zest takes it to a whole new level).  The space is very clean and comfortable, and every member of the staff is super friendly and attentive. Hands down my favorite Charlotte restaurant.",

First of all, this place isn't very big, but airy and spacious, thanks to its super-high ceilings...and a bright, light brown wooden motif. The place is also very well air conditioned (always a big plus in my book!); and provides cool, metro-chic overhead music. I've looked into Yama at SouthPark location, and I definitely prefer the modern decor and the lofty layout at this location.  The menu is typical of most Japanese restaurant, featuring the most popular Japanese staples. I noticed that they also specialized in a variety of \"Hand Rolls\", and offered several tantalizing desserts. I ordered the \"Waverly Roll\", along with an order of Tori Kara-age (AKA Fried Popcorn Chicken)...and both were Dee-Lish! From looking at Yelp pictures of their various sushi rolls, I didn't expect too much creativity... but regardless, their foods were well presented, in chic, upscaled tablewares.   Lastly, the service was spot on. Granted, there weren't many diners in the off hours (2-3 pm) I was there, but the waiter was friendly and attentive, and everything hit my table in a timely fashion.  Overall, I really liked what this place had to offer...both casual, yet chic at the same time, with a great variety of Japanese foods in a convenient location. Think I found a new favorite!",

    "text": "Love the decor in here!   Very cool industrial vibe. Good service.  A few things to improve on tho. We were a little mixed on the food.  We had the kalbi rib app - it had a yummy teriyaki glaze but the meat was super chewy and very hard to bite thru esp without a knife.   The popcorn chicken was a decent portion and very crispy.  Sauce that came with was a good complement.   I wish there were more sushi rolls to choose from on the menu like many other places do - several don't even include raw fish (literally half).   We had the niigata, naughty akami, and waverly.  All were just fine - didn't knock our socks off. Wish there was more texture - all the same flavor.   Also had the sashimi platter- very fresh and tender fish.  Lastly, they have a reso system on their website which is great but they do not take same day reso so I guess you have to plan ahead.  The hostess was a bit cold -  smiling a bit in the hospitality business would go along way.  Not opposed to going back, but not at the top of the list.",

As our main dishes we ordered the teriyaki chicken and the teriyaki steak. The main dishes were a bit bland in flavor, but still good. It was freezing cold in there, making it difficult to enjoy ourselves since we were dressed for the 95 degree weather. Our server was actually wearing a sweater in July. Unfortunately, the cold room temperature also caused our food to cool quickly, resulting in the last third of our meal being cold. If it would have been a proper temperature in there, then I would have given Yama 4 stars based on the food.",

It is a small place so I can see there being a wait if it gets crowded. The service was great. Our waiter came over to the table a few times to check on us and was helpful when needed. I would go back here for lunch, the dinner prices were a little high.",

We were seated so quickly for a Friday night during the Christmas holiday that I was almost scared! But those fears were quickly eased with the first cocktail. Although small, the cocktail menu had a few good suggestions. Definitely try their signature ones.   We started with calamari which was very good. I love calamari rings so I don't have to pick through an appetizer to find them.    I'd read rave reviews about the Crunchy to. And OMG was it delicious....so much so that I had the waiter bring a second one.   Only tip... avoid the tables next to the bar. I felt like bar patrons were infringing on our space.",

I didn't leave hungry by any means, but I should've ordered some veggies or something on the side. A couple people in our party had hibachi shrimp, steak, and chicken. It all looked delicious.

He loved each, but combined it's heaven. Sweet & tart lemon drop martini livened my palate! Dinner: He had the Yaki Udon with chicken. Stirred fried udon noodles, napa cabbage, shiitake mushroom, onion, carrot & spring onion. Generous portion with good ratio of protein, ingredients were very fresh & flavorful. I had the Grilled maple leaf farm duck breast w. steamed white rice. A beautiful display, however ... I forgot to order it medium & it came well done. Which made it tough and dry. Thankfully there was some seaweed salad to moisten it up a bit. Our server, Jennifer, was peppy and accommodating. Just wish she asked how I'd like my duck prepared. But the fact she brought extra silverware & laid it on napkins not the table made huge points w.this semi-germaphobe!",

Items ordered: Gyoza, edamame, calamari, popcorn chicken, Brussels sprouts, miso soup, clam soup, yaki udon and snow roll. The udon was very bland and reminded me of Chinese takeout. The miso soup also bordered on bland, but would prefer that over being overly salty which many restaurants tend to do. My husband said the roll was okay and noted the sashimi we had the previous night was much fresher (clean catch's sashimi grade fish). However, my husband is pretty critical when it comes to sushi and sashimi! The calamari was cooked tempura style and it was a little too much of the fried/grease taste and too little of the calamari. Our favorites of the meal were the edamame (kids loved), Brussels sprouts and clam soup.  Service: our server was attentive, friendly and knew the menu well. The food came out quickly and was warm on arrival.  Verdict: We probably won't be back and will opt for Musashi for Japanese food.",

We use to went to their other location at south park but we still wanna go and try at the waverly location anyway. The food was amazing as usual. I love the sea bass.The taste was beyond amazing. My family actually order of 3 orders of those, ofcourse! The bento box was a good price yet it can actually fill you up especially on the straving day from work. I love everything about their taste. They got their own difference taste but when you combine them all together, it become super delicious.! Yummm!",

We sat at the sushi bar and honestly staring at the fish cut up in takeout trays with saturated paper towels on the bottom was a little unappetizing. It looked like a mess. My biggest complaint was the noise. Felt more like a crowded bar than a nice restaurant.",

We went there during the family and friend soft opening. The decor, colors, setup and ambience are all light and refreshing. They offer a full selection of Japanese delicacies at very reasonable prices. LOVE their outstanding fresh sushi here, they are the freshest sushi we could find in Charlotte. We were also ordered a beef dish (Appetizer) Kalbi it was so tender and bursting with flavor, it had us understanding why not everyone in the place was ordering sushi. The service is great from the moment of entrance to the moment of exit. Everyone is friendly. Our favorite sushi place, highly recommend YUMA to my families and friends.",
