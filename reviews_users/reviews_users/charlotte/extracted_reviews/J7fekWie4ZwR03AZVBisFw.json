We order delivery daily for another restaurant and these people are less than 2 minutes from our company but they refuse to deliver unless we have a $25 order. It's fine because the food isn't really that tasty and the host/cashiers are always rude. So, thanks for saving us money.",

I have sampled many different dishes on different days and thus far I have yet to be disappointed.  My absolute favorites to pinpoint are the Meatloaf w/ red sauce, fried squash, and their Corn Bread (which tastes so good it should be on the dessert menu).",

Our waitress, a delightful older southern lady, came right over and had our drinks out instantly. Our fried pickle app, which turned out crisp and tasty, came out pronto as well. While waiting for our food, my bf noticed there were a lot of people working. While it is a large establishment that can fit a large crowd, there clearly wasn't a need for so many servers.  Dinner came out quickly. My meatloaf was clearly not homemade and rather disappointing - scraped off the tomato sauce and went with ketchup instead. The piping hot green beans  were lacking seasoning, however, the homemade Mac n cheese was the clear stand out with vast, down-home flavor! My bf had the crab cake, which were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. In my bf's words \"they've got yum inside of them!\" He paired it with onion rings and fries which were equally delicious. Oh, I also forgot to mention the sweet tea - on point! The desserts, which were displayed near the entrance, all looked spectacular. We will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "It was a Friday morning.  I was hungry, and wanted a break from the norm, so I pulled in to the relatively new Cafe' South on Arrowwood Rd.    You walk in, and it looks like a clean all night diner, but the place is not open all night (Which is ok with me). A few random nick knacks on the wall, and a simple open floor plan.   There is a counter at which you can eat that overlooks the kitchen through viewing / serving windows.  When the hostess sat me, she instantly asked what I wanted to drink, and had it to me before I was able to look through the first page of the menu.   Speaking of the menu, I was looking for a \"house specialty\"  on the menu but really nothing was blocked off or bolded as to make me think that they had one.  The menu (breakfast) was filled with standard breakfast fare.  Eggs, Omelets,  Breakfast Meats, and Pancakes.    The silverware rolled in a clean napkin was also clean.  The service was fast and courteous, tho there were only 3 other tables, so i can not vouch for if they get busy.  So far so good.  I ordered the Sausage & Cheese Omelet, Hash Browns and a Biscuit.   Seems simple enough to me.    Over all the food was not bad....  The Omelet:  The omelet was a bit over cooked for my taste (I know different people like it different ways)  The sausage was spread around in the omelet well, but the first few bites made me wonder if i had ordered cheese.  The second half of the omelet was were all the cheese was.  The omelet as a whole was a bit bland.  Not much flavor in it at all.  I was actually reaching for the salt, Which i never do.    If you like your omelets a bit fluffy and not dry and flat, i would vote you stay away.  The Hash Browns:  The hash browns were out of a box.  Not much different between these and Waffle House hash browns.  They were cooked again with no seasoning at all, just browned up on the flat top.  Once again I reached for the salt and pepper (to be fair, i do use pepper a fair amount)  The Biscuit:  Ahhh.  The glue of a good breakfast.   Being raised in NC i love me a good biscuit.  When it arrived alone in its little basket it looked super tasty.  Big, Fluffy and Golden Buttery Brown.  This is where the fantasy ended.  Again, the biscuit was bland, tho it looked as if it was baked fresh there, it tasted like there was a box somewhere in its life.  The middle was not fluffy like i had hoped and dreamed, but more dense and a bit heavy.  Kind of a sad ending to a mediocre meal.",

She was very friendly, just a cluster...the restaurant is very clean, looks brand new, the staff is friendly, the food is good, and the prices are right. The breakfast menu has several different options to choose from. The Hobo breakfast was delicious as was the omelet we ordered.  Some advice for the owners:  Get real pancake syrup dispensers-slapping down a bottle of Aunt Jemima's on the table is pretty tacky.  Get a better pancake recipe. The pancakes are super flat, dry, and over cooked. I know this not ihop, but I can make better pancakes than the ones we were served.",

I was there most recently for breakfast and had the hobo breakfast, which is hash browns, green peppers, onions, and bacon topped with two eggs and gravy. It also came with a biscuit. It came out quickly, and the eggs were poached exactly as I had requested them. The biscuit was fluffy and light and was not greasy. I also tried my friend's grits and wished I had more room to help her finish them, but the hobo had filled me up. Service was prompt, and our coffee and water were filled continuously. Everyone in our group of 7 was satisfied. Cafe South is definitely worth a try if you are in the area and looking for something quick and familiar.",

Breakfast is not hard but and what I had was good, but the lack of \"FRESH\" kind of set me off. The Biscuits are from a can and you can tell. They taste like it. It's not hard to make biscuits. Probably one of the simplest things to make but I can make canned pillsbury biscuits at home. I go out to have things I can't make at home with ease. There are other canned items on the menu like the mushrooms and other veggies. When I asked the owner about the biscuits he said it was for \"constancy\" purposes.  The grits were good but they had been sitting for a while and had the \"Grit Skin\" on them. Still pretty tasty.  Rule one of a restaurant is if you can get it local and fresh you do. Stop ordering everything from the back of a SISCO truck. Overall not bad but I don't see me going back there anytime soon. Nothing really awesome to write home about.  I think there is tons of room for improvement. The place is clean and in good shape now the food needs to match the offering. You can't have \"HOME COOKED MEALS\" on the sign and get biscuits from an can and using canned veggies...that is not \"HOME COOKED\"",

    "text": "We were really sad to see Bob Evans go as we really enjoy their breakfasts and especially their dinner plates. So when Cafe South eventually opened in the same building with very few changes, we thought we would give it a try.  Yep, nothing structural has changed. The same doors, the same hostess stand, the same tables and the same counters. The menu, on the other hand, has changed quite a lot. It's what I would call \"New York deli\" but with a Southern flavor. A wide variety of plates and meals, ranging from meatloaf to burgers to baked chicken to Thanksgiving turkey dinners. Breakfasts include the usual egg plates, but also a challah French toast and grits and biscuits. Like I said, Southern.  For dinner, I went with the meatloaf and for some reason, the brown gravy. Dumb mistake on my part. Meatloaf should be with a tomato sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was okay. But I feel like I let the side down.  Service was very friendly. Helpful and sincere. Enjoyable, even.  We will absolutely be back again!",

    "text": "We recently met some friends here for lunch and we were pleasantly surprised with our visit!  Our service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the prices were very reasonable.    Looking at the menu, I saw the typical diner-style offerings that were common in joints owned by Greek families when I was a kid growing up in Charlotte.  Here, you will find a huge selection including sandwiches, salads, burgers, or a vast selection of entrees including the traditional \"meat & 2\" offerings (including baked or fried chicken, thanksgiving dinner, fried catfish or flounder, meatloaf, etc...).  The entrees are served with your choice of a roll or cornbread.   The side dish options include such southern staples as fried okra, mac & cheese, green beans, collard greens, mashed potatoes, Lima beans, corn fries, onion rings, rice, fried squash, candied yams, banana pudding, and many more traditional southern favorites.  There were so many yummy sides that on my next visit, I may have to go for a veggie plate (you can choose a veggie plate with 3 or 4 sides).   For my lunch, I decided on the baked chicken (you get to specify whether you want white meat or dark meat), corn bread, mac & cheese and fried okra.  Everything was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The mac & cheese wasn't as good as grandma's - but it as close as you can get in a restaurant!   2 of the folks at my table ordered dessert, so I got to try a bite of each.  First the pecan pie - I would not order this. It is nothing like grandma's - too much mushy filling and not enough pecans. Disappointing... it seemed to be \"commercial grade pie\" rather than \"home-made pie\" in my opinion.    Next up was the peach cobbler - our server really talked this one up, but again, it fell short of my expectations. It was better than the pecan pie, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  (Maybe they can do a better job on this when fresh peaches are available?)  In any case, next time I'll just have to order my own dessert and of course, it will be the banana pudding.  All in all, this place serves up good honest food - nothing fancy - but just yummy.  I really wish there were places like this closer to my neighborhood!",

The food was just okay.\"  Since my whole family was in town visiting, I was trying to make sure we got a few local places under our belt, outside of the typical chains ( like IHOP, Waffle House, etc). Since I've driven past this place many times and it always looks pretty packed, I was eager to give this place a try.   Based on the reviews, I was ready to be beyond WOW'ed and I just wasn't. The hostess was very friendly and seated us very quickly. Our waitress was okay. She wasn't very enthusiastic or knowledgeable about the menu or great at making suggestions for first time diners. But she kept the coffee and water glasses full and got our order so I guess that makes up for it.   Everyone ordered something different, so we could share and before we knew we had pancakes, french toast, a meat omelet, bacon, hash browns and grits flying around the table.   My favorite by far was the french toast, it's made on challah bread and ready thick and filling with a touch of powder sugar...yum!   Everything else was just pretty standard. Not bad. Just standard. There was one small downside, I wasn't a fan of the grits...perhaps that's my fault because I was secretly comparing them to Flying Biscuit...oh well!   I mean I'm not writing this place off completely. I definitely want to try their lunch and dinner options. But for now, this place is just A-Ok.   On a personal note, there's a waitress there named Mary and even though she didn't wait on us she is super friendly and extremely professional. As we were leaving she chatted with us, and even complimented my grandmother on how good she looked for her age...she also made sure to thank us for coming in and told us to have a great day. When I go back, I'm definitely going to request to sit in her section! She's a real jewel to the restaurant!",

Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and personable. I have absolutely no complaints regarding the staff. My biggest complaint is with their prices. Breakfast spots are always known for cheaper prices so when our bill rang up to $30+, we were not pleased. We didn't mention it to management because it is what it is, but we won't go back and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. They don't offer many breakfast combos or platters, so you're forced to order pancakes separate from eggs and a side. I don't recall the name of my combo but I had two scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, grits, and pancakes. My turkey sausage was awfully dry and lacked flavor. The grits tasted good and it's pretty much impossible to mess up scrambled eggs so the meal was decent. NOT $15+ worth!! I ended up taking my pancakes to go but didn't have an appetite for them when I got home (probably because I kept thinking about how ridiculously overpriced they were) and they ended up in the garbage. I'd recommend that the owners reconsider their menu options and prices. Offer better breakfast platters and make their prices comparable to other restaurants that are similar in style. I wouldn't recommend trying this place knowing that there are other breakfast spots in the area that are better quality and more reasonably priced.",

I opted for the \"huge\" baked sweet potato and their mac and cheese. On top of this my entree also came with hushpuppies. Purely impossible to fit all of that in my stomach,  so needless to say...most of it came home with me.  My husband had the country fried steak with mac and cheese and collard greens. Collards weren't like \"home collards\" but he did finish it. It did the job and was seasoned. Mac and cheese was good, again not like home, mine or my mom's! My fish was good and hubs chicken fried steak was good (according to him). The corn bread was warm & soft. The fried chicken our Uncle had looked and smelled delicious along with some of the other guests at the table.  We will definitely return and hope to get Dana again.

In my first experience with her, she wasn't busy but would rather stand behind the counter than to refill my drink. When i ordered meatloaf, she also didn't ask me if I wanted the brown or red sauce and just gave the brown sauce.    The 2nd time Lee was my server, it was crazy busy in the restaurant but the same mistakes were made.  She even had help with her other tables and at ours drinks went unfilled and when she did, she filled tea glasses with the wrong thing.  Sweet went in the unsweet glass and unsweet went in the sweet glass.  Also we didn't get our cornbread until we were almost finished eating.    Foodwise, this place rocks.  The meatloaf is my favorite.  The cornbread is the best I've tasted at a restaurant and the banana pudding is awesome.   Everyone is very friendly here and you get plenty for your money here.  Just watch out for Lee.",

The menu was extensive so a bit overwhelming but southern staples were clearly the theme throughout.  We were here for a client lunch and the menu items ranged from meatloaf to fried chicken to wraps to salads, gyros. They had veggie platters and familiar items like hush puppies, biscuits, sweet potatoes, etc.    I ordered the Greek salad with grilled chicken and it was very good! I was told the owners are Greek so there was no surprise there!  We ordered a basket of hush puppies and they were excellent!  My associates ordered a veggie platter with Lima beans, fried squash, collard greens and green beans.  She enjoyed it very much and it was served with cornbread.  My other associate ordered a grilled chicken plate that came with a side of veggies, brown rice and a side salad.    Everyone really seemed to enjoy their meals and we really enjoyed the price tag.  You can get a lot of good food for a very reasonable price!",

The biscuits were cold and kind of hard, so the butter did not even melt, which is an unfortunate thing.  We also fired the belgian waffle which was average, and fell right in line with the theme of this place.    Unrelated rant: This isn't a complaint about Cafe South in particular, but why are belgian waffles so damn expensive??? $4-6 for some batter that costs the place somewhere in the neighborhood of about $0.05 - $0.10 to make.  And God forbid you put some whipped cream on top, with strawberry syrup, or potentially a sprinkling of chocolate chips.....BACK UP THE F'n BRINK'S TRUCK at that point, bc this mixture of flour and water is going to run you about $12!  Stop laughing, Pancakes....bc this applies to you, too, you consistently overpriced syrup delivery system! It's time we knocked waffles/pancakes down a peg.  Far more creativity goes into making a cinnamon raisin bagel, then throwing some batter on a hot surface and spraying it with whipped cream, but we don't bow down to it and pay $5 for the chance to eat it.    ...but anyway, Cafe South wasn't that great, so I probably won't be going there again.",

    "text": "I wanted one last 'local' meal before heading back to Portland after being in Charlotte on business.  I looked to Yelp as I often do for a highly rated, local place. I am also trying to get my parents out of their chain restaurant rut.  Cafe South fit the bill.  Being the middle of the afternoon we were seated immediately.  Mom ordered a chicken quasadilla; the portion was more than she could eat in a sitting & the chicken tasted fresh grilled (as opposed to cooked, frozen, thawed & served).  Dad got a burger; he's not a man of many words but commented 3 times how good it was.    I ordered the crab cakes which came with 3 hush puppies and choice of 2 sides. From the long list of side options I picked mac & cheese and a sweet potato (which the sound of which I was drooling over).  The crab cakes were perfectly seasoned, the onion batter hush puppies (which I prefer to corn bread HP's) and the mac & cheese was perfect.   My one complaint, why I gave 4 and not 5 stars: When our food was brought to our table the waitress at that time informed me that they were out of sweet potatoes, causing me to have to order another side.  I was disappointed that I was not made aware of this when I placed my order or prior to it being delivered to the table.  The waitress- who was kind, friendly & funny- did not bring a menu back.  Since I could only recall a few, I selected sweet potato fries instead, which I had forgotten were $1 extra (the only side, I will mention that had a surcharge).  One would think since they ran out of my 1st choice they would have offered the fires without the surcharge but I was charged it anyway.  If you are traveling I77 through south Charlotte and need a break & good food this is your place.  Good, quality food at a good price without the boredom of a chain.  PS-- Not being aware the building formerly housed a Bob Evans, my father actually commented it looked like one. lol",

It was a good homecooked meal and contrary to what another reviewer said, we had homemade biscuits.  I know canned biscuits and these were not.  I asked for a small (condiment size) bowl of their sausage gravy to go with my eggs and hash browns and was not charged.

I found the shrimp to be really good and flounder was decent.  The hush puppies were very good, and I ordered green beans and okra on the side.  The green beans were full of flavor and clearly made from scratch.  The okra was standard restaurant okra and was fine.    My daughter said she liked the spaghetti, not as good as home, but better than what the school serves, so I guess that's a passing grade.  She was more fond of the mac and cheese, which was clearly made from scratch and appeared to be cooked in the oven, as opposed to over the stove.  We split a red velvet cupcake for dessert, which was very good and clearly made from scratch (all the desserts look fantastic), although very small and overpriced, which is surprising considering how reasonably priced the dinner menu was.  We will definitely dine here again, as the menu is original and diverse in selection, and, for the most part, the food lives up to the \"home cooked\" billing they give it.",

I do not know if any one there has ever tried to eaten any of their meals from meatloaf to an omelet with the to go fork and knife, but it's terrible.  They just bend.

I did not feel like cabbing or Ubering (is that word in the dictionary yet?) so I decided to give it a try.  I found the food to be very good and the service prompt and friendly. I had a gyro pita platter which included a serving of moist, tender gyro meat with tzadziki sauce. I am watching my carbs so I substituted grilled veggies for fries. They weren't anything really special but they weren't bad at all. The side salad that came with it was served on the same plate as the gyro meat. I would have rather had it on a separate plate but that's just me. Very minor. The salad was fresh and tasty. Nothing exceptional, but good (the tomato could have been prettier).  The service was great. Very nice server and, again, very prompt. I was in and out in a jiffy. All-in-all, a very enjoyable meal. So much so that I am planning to return in the morning for breakfast.",

It is a former Bob Evans and the lobby is not so inviting. There are business cards all over the place and the check-in area could use a refresh. Similarly, the bathroom was rough around the edges. I am pretty sure there were blood stains on the walls.  Anyway, the food was decent. The meatloaf was quite tasty but the yams had a funny metallic taste, almost as if they came out of a can. My server was really nice but I do not recall his name.  Anyway, this is a convenient, cheap southern diner. It is nothing you would go out of your for by any means, but would be good for a quick, inexpensive lunch. If the lobby area and restrooms were touched up, it would probably have left a better impression.",

I've had the Chicken Gyro (fantastic, the chicken was so flavorful) the Flounder Fish Sandwich (came plain, ask for lettuce & tomato) the Spinach Omelette (so tasty) the Breakfast Special! The service is friendly & quick! It reminds me of a Marie Calendars restaurant. There are delicious looking deserts in the display, but I've always been too full to try them. I also saw little 4 packs of wine bottles which I'm guessing you can get to go, especially if you are staying at one of the hotels near here. The grits are soooo good! You have to try this place if you haven't been here before! I bet you will like it too!",

I have been to known steakhouses that couldn't get their steak together and Cafe South really impressed me.  One of my friends got a Pita burger and the other one steak with fried veggies. We all enjoyed our food that took a little to get done but the waitress kept us informed all the way and was very nice. I wish they had more servers for lunch time, I had to rush back to work because took a while for my food to get done. I also asked for rolls and she brought me corn bread.  Overall it was a good experience but they need to improve the prep time. Unfortunately I didn't not take pictures this time because I was really hungry !!!!",

It had great flavor and was cooked to perfection The coleslaw was nice and chilled and it had a nice crunch to it. The macaroni and cheese was a little bland but it was still good. I am an airline crew member and I recommended to a fellow crew member and she said her food was delicious as well. I hope to return in the future. And the prices were quite reasonable. Great job Cafe South",

My main tip is they don't serve breakfast all day. Total bummer.  The menu is rather large but the food isn't that good. I got the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and grilled vegetables. The chicken was ok. Fried well, but dry and not special by any means. The mashed potatoes were under seasoned and cold with very little gravy. The veggies were gross. First off, they were frozen.  Come on, frozen veggies?? And \"grilled\" is a stretch. You can't fix frozen veggies.   We also got the chicken parmesan, kids spaghetti, side of Mac and cheese, side of fruit, and banana pudding.  The pasta dishes were acceptable. The Mac and cheese was good-although dry, and the fruit was oranges and cantaloupe.   Bottom line, for $55 plus tip, it wasn't worth it. We have fond several really great places to eat here while on vacation and this was our first flop. We wouldn't go back.",

We were given breakfast menus, which I thought a bit odd given the time, but breakfast is probably my favorite meal to eat out, so we rolled with it.  Judging by the looks of the place (both inside and out), I'd guess that it used to be a Bob Evans at some point (but don't quote me on that).   The service was outstanding- our food was ready in probably 5 minutes (granted, they were pretty simple orders, but even still...).  My wife had scrambled eggs, grits, and a biscuit. I ordered turkey sausage, egg, and cheese on a an English muffin with a side of hash browns. The food was hot and tasty and prices were pretty reasonable.  Apparently they serve lunch and dinner too, but I'm wondering when that might be if they're still handing out breakfast menus past noon.",

    "text": "Let me state right up front there's nothing really shout-worthy going on here, IMO.  But, it is a solid, Greek-owned family restaurant that has the basics down pat.  Southern cooking and charm, all tucked into a refurbished Bob Evan's shell.    Ample parking, good seating, fast and friendly service, good food, and a great location.  I even was introduced to Mary, even though my server was Shay who did a great job, too!  Bottomless coffee until I said no (the coffee was just OK).  So why not 5 stars?  Because they focus on good--not great--southern-style fare.  Want your biscuits and gravy?  They got 'em (although Midnite Diner rocks this one, they came close).  Want grits with your livermush?  Sure (although Candyce B. thinks Flying Biscuit has their grits beat--I agree).  Pancakes?  Yes.  Three egg omelets?  Yup.  Cafe South has a good thing going here, and I doubt they are interested in tweaking it too much.  I will save my last star for those rare places in this crowded space truly reaching for it with remarkable, \"OMG you gotta try their take on .... \" kind of fare.  But, I'll be back!",

    "text": "A-OK perfectly describes our lunch visit to Cafe South today.  I would not go out of my way to eat here, but we will probably return for the occasional lunch of meat, tea and two for a reasonable price.   We also thought that breakfast is probably really good here, so we may have to blow off work one morning to try it.    Located just off of Arrowood near the 77 exits (previously a Bob Evans), the signage made it easy for my co-pilot to spot.  Parking was fine.  If you need to get back to 77, you will need to make a u-turn at the light after exiting the parking lot onto Arrowood, or exit through the back of the parking lot and drive between the hotels to get to the stoplight.    Arriving at 11:30, a little before the lunch crowd which seemed to all be regulars, we were quickly seated by the smiling hostess and then immediately greeted by our friendly waitress who took our drink order.  Service was 5-star - our drinks were kept filled and food was quickly brought as it popped up at the pass.    The lunch: We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.   I ordered the country fried steak, white gravy on the side, with sides of collard greens and mac and cheese.  When asked if we wanted dinner rolls or corn bread, we simultaneously said \"corn bread!\".    Spinach artichoke dip:  Served hot with tortilla chips.  Standard dip, nothing fancy or odd.  Was creamy and tasty with plenty of spinach.   Country fried steak + gravy:  Instead of one large piece of meat that takes up the plate and is difficult to slice, my serving was two medium sized pieces of meat (a little larger than a Wendy's burger patty). The meat was tender and the fried coating stayed on the steak when cutting.  The gravy was a little bland, but nothing the salt and pepper shaker couldn't help.  (I find diner type restaurants typically are on the bland side of seasonings - you can always add salt and/or pepper to suit your taste, no big). Collards - the first few bites were okay, again not a lot of seasoning, the last few bites were a little bitter. Mac and cheese - sort of like homemade, but again on the under-flavored side.  It was fine. Cornbread - yummy!  It is cake-like in consistency and sweet.  Good with a swipe of butter.  The dessert case looked amazing, with different kinds of cakes, pies and baklava, but I was way too full from lunch to even consider it.  Fast, friendly and priced right, this is a neat little diner.",

I have recommended many people seeing as I work at a neighboring hotel. After the completely rude and disrespectful service we received today we will not be returning. We came in at 4pm on Thursday to have a beer and an early dinner. Darlene was our waitress. It started out nice until she felt the need to ask for my boyfriends ID multiple times. She questioned what type of people we were. After the third time that she asked for his ID she noticed the visibly upset look on my face she tried to defend herself by saying \" we have a lot of people come in and try to play us. This isn't the best area\" how dare she insinuate what type of people we are. We have never left less than a 12$ tip at this place. We keep our table clean or order simple. It isn't hard to read an ID. After the third time she asked us and made little comments about the type of people that come into the restaurant we decided to leave before even placing an order. When we went to notify her that we were leaving she then tried to write up a ticket for the one beer and sweet tea that hadn't even been touched. We told her no we were not going to pay. The manager or owner then asked us why. Upon trying to explain the oh so lovely Darlene began to roll her eyes and deny that she had asked multiple times for an ID. She began talking over my boyfriend while he was calmly trying to speak with the manager. Once my boyfriend turned around to leave she then felt the need to make sarcastic goodbye hand gestures. I called her out on such disrepeftful behavior and stuck to my word when I said I would be giving this review.",

    "text": "First of all the food is not that bad.....the thing that gave this place 1 star for me was the way their staff are treated...the owners Paul and Pete are horrible, they belittle their staff and yell at them in front of the customers....for example...I had went their for breakfast and ordered their breakfast special which consisted of eggs bacon and grits I also got the biscuits with a side of country gravy. I started spooning out my gravy for my biscuit when I noticed a chewed piece of gum in there. I got my waitress and showed her as she was appalled at what I had found. She asked if I wanted another one and I did so she went to get it. She came back and said my manager thinks you put that in there so I'm sorry but I can't get you another one. At that point I was ready to see the manager.....as she was comming back to the table I witnessed the manager/owner PAUL run in the back like he was a coward....like you can't even fix this problem and it's a BIG problem, chewed gum in my gravy. So maybe after 10 minutes he finally came over and DID nothing, not even comp my meal...as I was leaving I had overheard some of the girls talking saying Pete had gotten on the cooks earlier for chewing gum..so obviously the gum came from the cooks not me....so you have lost a lot of customers (I tell everybody I know not to go there) and got a BAD review all because you didn't try and make my experience okay over some GRAVY!!!! DONT GO THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE BLAMMED IF SOMETHING IS WRONG AND LIKE TO WATCH YOUR WAITRESS BE HUMILIATED AND YELLED AT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT....one more thing...if your waitress doesn't come back to the table dont take it out on them that would be PETE telling them not to go back because you sent something back....yes one more thing look at your checks and make sure they didn't forget to price something or make sure everything you ordered is on the bill because once you go to pay and they didn't charge you for your appitizer your waitress is going to have to pay for it even if they catch it and charge you for it they STILL make the waitress pay....HORRIBLE PLACE OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE OWNERS!!!!!!!! ( if I could have gave 0 stars I would have because you dont treat people like that....)",

Everyone enjoyed their dinners - the Thanksgiving Dinner Platter for me with everything you would expect right down to the canned jellied cranberry sauce (my preference!), the catfish and grits for my husband, and the Mac 'n' Cheese for our M'n'C connoisseur kid.  The hushpuppies are just what they should be - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, a little sweet and no weird add-ins.  So good, we went back for breakfast the next morning!  Not many places get \"eggs-over-medium\" right - Cafe South did!  We'll go back whenever we are in Charlotte.",

My company orders from there a few times a week and every single time there is SOMETHING wrong with our order. Usually so bad that we end up having to drive all the way back. The staff is super nice about it but it gets completely irritating constantly having an issue and having to go all the way back after im already back at work. Last time I ordered they completely forgot one of our whole meals that we had already paid for! I complained to the manager about how constantly getting our order wrong is redundant and he kinda shrugged me off but assured me they would start checking the orders. They obviously did NOT because today I ordered an omelet specifying I am a vegetarian and its full of ham. Obviously I am not a happy customer after that. the food is good but it kills the experience when im constantly picking things out or its just not how I ordered It or were missing meals all together! Just wish they could be a little more efficient.",

From the outside, it looks like a boring old restaurant, but once you get inside the staff is very friendly and the comfort food is cooked well. In a 5 day span, I went here 3 times and I did not have one complaint, other than the portions are very generous for the price.

Church let out in Davidson around 10:30am and what should have only been a 30 minutes drive down took a bit over and hour because of a traffic accident at the junction with 1-277 which had all lanes blocked except for one. Six lanes going to one slows things down considerably.  We got to the the restaurant about 11:45 and were promptly seated.  First impression was \"this is a Bob Evans\".  Asked the hostess and she confirmed that this restaurant had been previously a Bob Evans  When the new owners bought it, they did not do much to change the feel.  Looked over the menu and we both ordered the Meatloaf plate.  In my case I got a side house salad and fried okra and for the Meatloaf, tomato sauce on top.  My wife ordered her Meatloaf with Brown Gravy and for sides, fried Okra and Mashed Potatoes.  They messed up here order and brougnt Mac and Cheese but promptly corrected it.  My wife liked her Meatloaf but I found mine to a bit bland.  Sides were very good however.  Portions are large and service is very good. It's at Exit 3 on I-77 just to the east of the intersection.  Good place for the traveler because it's north of the Carowinds Congestion but before you get to the Charlotte traffic snarl.",

It was good but needed a little salt and pepper. I'd give it a 3 out of 5. The Mac n cheese was ok too. The squash was good.  My husband had the grilled shrimp and petite rib eye. He liked it.  The desserts were disappointing but there were several to chose from.  Heres the thing, It bothers me when owners mistreat their employees.  I dont understand how wait staff is supposed to recommend dishes if the owners expect employees to pay full price for meals and force them to pay for drinks even if they don't partake.",

So good after adding a pinch of salt and pepper.  On weekends you can get breakfast up to 1pm and guess what....drum roll please.... banana pudding is a vegetable. Yes people, you can get a very nice, shareable size scoop as one of your sides. It was good too. Hubby and I scaped the bowl.  Everyone was friendly and truly treated you like family. When our server returned with the food she said, \"Food's here. Take them elbows off the table like granny said. Granny gone get ya.\" Wow! My granny used to always tell me that.

Their menu is very expansive and great for home cooked food! But they have so many other things like pasta, gyros, burgers and wraps! Their prices are really decent as well and you get a lot of food! I love the style of French fries they have (those breaded crispy ones)! I would definitely come back here again and again!",

She anticipated what was needed but still checked to see if I needed anything in such an unobtrusive manner I barely noticed her presence. She was friendly though and seemed so at ease at her profession. It's so rare to get service like this anywhere much less in a small cafe. I had tea with lemon and honey. She brought everything out and an extra glass of water. I didn't ask for it, but when you're eating you sometimes need something cold to wash it down. So good food, excellent friendly and efficient restaurant.",

Service was attentive a at all times and everyone was friendly.  Mac and cheese was made from scratch, as well as the meatloaf.  All of it was what I would have expected but the cooks need to learn to cook from the heart and increase flavor.  All of the food was just missing something; it was not poor quality but just the three stars I gave them.  I will definitely return but with a bit lower expectations.",

We had a rule of no repeats, but we were running out of options for a quick lunch by week 2 that wasn't fast food, and we also had a no fast food rule. The 1st time I had a chicken tender salad.  The chicken tenders were juicy and delicious.  I cant remember what my friend had, and the 3rd party probably had burger and fries because that is all she eats.  We also had fried pickle chips that were very crispy and tasty.  The 2nd trip I had delicious chicken and rice soup and club sandwich, I'm not sure what the other 2 had.  Really the only reason we returned the 3rd time was we saw the chicken pot pie on our 2nd trip and regretted not ordering it.  Unfortunately, we didn't know it was a Wed special and we returned on a Thursday.  We were very disappointed about that.  So I had a chicken club wrap which was very large and my friend had a club sandwich.  The 3rd party did not join us on that trip because preferred corndogs at the gas station.  The service is a little slow but I am sure its because the food is all made fresh.  I am still sad about the chicken pot pie!",

After dropping off a colleague in Charlotte, NC (and before a long drive to Charleston, SC), I decided to pop in here in search of a hearty meal before hitting the road.  The menu is chock full of Southern comfort food items.  I opted for the chopped BBQ pork plate with choice of two \"vegetables\", which could include things like mac and cheese or mashed potatoes (both of which I ordered.)  Hush puppies come with any plate meal, but can be swapped for cornbread or biscuit.  The pork was quite good, not overly smoky or with too much sauce.  Mac and cheese was very tasty, with a good creamy texture and browning on top.  Was less enthused with the mashed potatoes, which tasted reminiscent of instant spuds from a box.  After dinner, I ordered the caramel apple pie.  Rather than a traditional pie crust, it had one made of buttery shortbread.  It was delicious and just the right serving size.  Service was very congenial, stopping often to chat for a minute.  Cafe South is just a solid, good 'ol Southern-style diner.",

Staff was friendly. Our waitress seemed a little stiff at first but then she loosened up a bit.   I learned it used to be a Bob Evans, which is the first place my family and I ate when we first moved to NC, so I suppose it was a bit nostalgic. The decor was confusing though. It was almost like a cross between a diner and a trying Italian restaurant, though I really loved the clock shaped like a skillet!   5/5. Nothing was so wrong that I had to take a star away.",

We were seated promptly in a booth and immediately could tell the building previously housed a Bob Evans, with the exact same lay out of tables, booths and counter I've seen many times before.  Hungry from driving all day, we looked over their lengthy southern comfort food menu. Indecisive over so many mouth-watering options, I finally decided on one of my faves, hot open-face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. When our waitress came back and looked at my quickly disappearing meal she said, \"I'm not even going to ask you how your meal is...you should slow down and taste it.\" Yeah, it was pretty darn good, just like her sense of humor.  With a convenient location (right off I-77), wonderful food, affordable pricing and great service, I completely concur with all the other positive reviews. If you find yourself in the area and hungry for some tasty southern dining, find Cafe South and enjoy.",

Now, I know that every restaurant and every cook has an off day and I'm sure that this was what happened here.  We started off with the Cafe fries (fries, cheese, and bacon) and it was pretty good. Fries were crispy and the homemade ranch was definitely good. Unfortunately, one of the appetizer plates came to our table with old food crusted on it.   I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. It was just awful. The potatoes had the strangest consistency and had an unidentifiable and unpleasant taste. I asked my husband to try it and he agreed. The chicken fried steak in itself was fair and the mac and cheese was greasy. The cornbread was a bit tough.   My husband ordered the three cheese baked ziti with meat sauce. As my husband put, \"it's not good\". I gave it a try and agreed with him. It seemed almost watered down.   Our waitress was a doll and was super sweet. She was very helpful and friendly.  If we are passing through town again, we won't be back.",

Decided to give it a shot for breakfast based on Yelp reviews and will certainly return on my many trips up here.  Nice little Greek diner setup with amazingly inexpensive prices. Large portions. Tried the catfish and eggs for breakfast and absolutely loved the light and flaky batter on the fish. Almost no oil. The scrambled eggs were a bit dry, but the bacon, english muffins, creamy grits, and home fries were all absolutely delicious.  Saw the Baklava and pies / cakes in the cooler as we were leaving and it looked absolutely divine.  Service here was spot on, very friendly, and attentive. Good stuff!",

Service was fantastic; menu is incredible (so many choices!); portion sizes are generous; and food came quicker than the time it took me to decide what I wanted to order! Prices are very reasonable. For dessert, we shared an order of the molten chocolate cake and added vanilla ice cream--also very good. I highly recommend this place!",

Other than that very enjoyable experience.  Plan to come back for breakfast - as it's close to the Marriott courtyard where we are staying.  Portions were good sized took some back with us.",

I came here with a group of six, during the Morning Shift of Sunday, and the food about if anything slightly above average for some breakfast and it came out quickly. Clean area, and a fair price for the food that you get. The only note is that the food could be plated more elegantly, but that is just being picky at the least. I would come here again if I'm in the area.",

The sauce was just the right amount where I could still taste everything in the wrap, so it was not over powering. The wrap was cut in half perfectly too, so if you wanted to split it or take it home that's a great option. It also came with fries that were warm and crispy but still potato-y in the middle. The meal cost about $10 and was very good!",
