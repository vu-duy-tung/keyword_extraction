    "text": "Met a couple of friends for dinner prior to the Todd Snider/Kevin Gordon show at the Visulite Theatre.  Apparently our friends had quick service from the minute they arrived, but once we arrived, it took forever in between visits.  We realized next time we ordered a drink, we should order two at the same time.  Horrible.  And we ended up being late for the show.  The food was okay.  I much prefer Don Pedro or Azteca, though, especially for the price and service.  Oh, and watch out ordering the Low-Carb Margarita.  The prices aren't listed on the menu and we were stunned when we got the bill and they were $10 each (served in a lo-ball glass!)  Luckily I only had one to try as my friend was enjoying her 3rd, only to wish she hadn't either.  She wasn't feeling any effects, so they made them pretty weak, too.  On top of that, we thought we were getting a great deal with $3 drafts, but they were short-poured and served in very thick glasses.  Deceiving.  Ahh well.  Live and learn.  The show was great, though and the drinks at the Visulite more than made up for this unfortunate experience.",

It is not just gloopy 'mexican' food on the plate, there is presentation and some good composition dishes, not just taco, burrito, enchilada combinations. The restrooms are spotless and the bartender is knowledgeable. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have not eaten enough dishes (i'm hooked on the chimichangas) to give the 5th star. Now they serve aguas frescas & have daily drink specials. Would recommend you to try them out!",

Great vibe, food, and drinks all around.  I was seated at the bar with a couple of my buddies and the bartender took care of us with quickness and efficiency.  Making sure our food orders came out on time, and that we always had chips and salsa.  I am from the Bay Area, so I have pretty high standard of what Mexican food should taste like, aside from having real Mexican food in Mexico.  Drinks were decently price, not too expensive.  I tried my first \"flight of tequila\" and with it he made his own special sangria mix as a chaser.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Didn't catch his name, but my friends and I thought he was a cool dude.  Non-locals try the Hop Drop n Roll IPA if they have it.",

I like this place- it's a bit more \"fancy\" for a cheaper Mexican spot.  It's a cute date spot.  Cozy booths so you can talk to your dinnermate in peace.    We had table side guacamole.  It was great!!!  We asked for it extra spicy, and she even brought us an extra huge side of slice jalepenos to get it to the heat we were wanting.  The ambiance here is great.  If you want big portions- stick to my spot Three Amigos on Central.  I got the mixed grill fajitas.  The shrimp were tiny compared to Three Amigos and the portion in general of fajitas was half the size.  Ulimited chips and salsa were delish!  I'd go back, but may try something besides the fajitas.",

I've gotten the carne asada dinner several times, and it's pretty awesome.  Huge portion, tasty, and I always got at least one more meal out of it by throwing the leftovers into a tortilla at home.  They also give you more than one type of salsa with your chips, I love that for a change.  I'm a fan of the outdoor seating.  Dislikes:  Definitely tastes like \"Americanized\" Mexican food, though they still do a good job at that.  I went on a Sunday night once and got the margaritas on special, but the marg mix was fluorescent in color and pretty terrible (I cant judge the normal margaritas, since I never wanted to try them again).    Take it or leave it:  Take it.  I like this place.  It's a little Americanized, but so are most places in Charlotte.",

My boyfriend and I are big Mexican food fans (thought not picky about authenticity per say) and we are VERY pleased with 1900!  The chips and salsa are my favorite in town! The salsa isn't chunky, which I actually prefer and it's just the right about of heat. My bf doesn't approve of the salsa, but definitely agrees the chips are legit.  I'm also in love with the refried beans here. I could just eat a plateful of these and be happy!   1900 has a decent selection of vegetarian options, but they could definitely add more to get more stars from from me. Even so, they are great about adapting their other menu options to become veggie-friendly... like substituting beans or grilled veggies instead of chicken or beef.  My favorite part of menu is the CREATE A COMBO on the back. I usually avoid these sections at most Mexican restaurants, but 1900 is a little swankier so I gave it a go....I was not disappointed!!  You can choose between burritos, chimichangas, enchiladas, hard tacos, soft taco, tamals, or tostadas.  One item is $7.50, two items are $8.50 and three items are $9.50. Since all of these come with a heaping pile of rice and beans... this is an excellent deal!  My favorite by far is the CHIMICHANGA! Holy moly these things are amazing! Especially since they let me substitute the meat for those glorious refried beans.  My boyfriend loves the soft tacos here. He's so happy that they come with 2 tortillas to make them extra durable and hearty. He tried the chicken, beef, and pork until he settled on the pork being his favorite and that's all he orders now.  On a final note, I really enjoy the atmosphere at 1900. It's not your typical kitschy Mexican decor, but has enough flare with aztec art and prayer candles that it's got a definite style. The restaurant is neutral enough so that you can dress super casual in yoga pants and a tee or dress up classy with a cocktail dress and heels.",

They came with rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. Quite good.  My husband ordered the vegetable fajitas with corn tortillas.  He seemed surprised when a plate of rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole and salsa arrived with his grilled vegetables.  He did not use the corn tortillas and appeared to prefer eating his rice and bean plate, along with the vegetables.  My husband stated that the vegetables had no seasoning, but, to be fair, he did not consume them in the way intended.  I did try the vegetables, and they needed salt and pepper when consumed without the other items.  Salt and pepper not on the table, which seems to be a trend with restaurants these days. My husband had a touch of the grouch that night, so my review is primarily based on my experience.  I will return when he is having a night out with the guys!",

Their veggie burrito is superior to the local competition, the fact that they use lard-free re-fried beans is awesome! The complimentary salsa is okay, but has a hint of canned tomato to it that prevents it from being great.  They have a very nice selection of mixed drinks that are very tasty. On of my extremely picky friends tried their jalapeno margarita on my suggestion and was ecstatic about it.  The place has a nice wide open dining area with plenty of seating and nice cultural decoration. Good for everything from a family dinner, to a business meeting, to a date. The bar is kinda of small compared to the dinning area, but I have always been able to get a seat there. I'm really glad I started trying this place out more often.",

Perhaps a beer will shroud my anger in a warm blankie of malt and hops and we can move along. Except they don't have most of the list - so I end up with a Dos Equis Lager, aka Mexican Bud. Sigh.  Fajitas were sub par and eerily sweet. Guac was olive-fading-to-bark brown, and dispensed very stingily. What did I attempt to eat? Their tortafication of a veggie burger, which despite muchos toppings, was mushy boredom. Served on waaaay too much Teleras bread. And unripe avocado, which, when put on a sammich, likes to make a run for it and squish out onto your lap/plate/shoe.  Our server was good. Poor girl.

I will clarify that the service I have received at the bar far exceeds the service when in the dining area. My experience in the dining area has been spotty, but not enough to deter me from going here.  Nice outdoor seating on a large sidewalk when the weather is right.  They make a mean Michelada-- which is almost impossible to find in Charlotte!   My favorite menu items are the sopa de lima and the ceviche. The bowl of soup is HUGE- easily 2 servings . Everything my friends and I have ordered there is great!  The portions are plentiful, you will most certainly have leftovers for lunch!",

The salsa was good with a nice kick.  The chips were just ok.  Sangria was on special ($6) that night so I ordered a glass.  It was well-made with fruit flavors that paired well with the wine.  I ordered the Huitlacoche Quesadilla which featured mexican cheese, corn truffle, roasted poblanos, and corn pico.  The positive is that they give you plenty of quesadilla.  I think there were 8 sizable slices.  I wish they had come with some sour cream or extra corn pico on the side.  Our service was fine but defintely not overly warm.",

The decor is colorful and the ceilings high. It is a very high energy environment and all of the staff is very helpful.  The food itself ain't bad. We got guacamole and cheese dip to start. Both were pretty solid. I got the fish tacos for my entree. They weren't bad-- though I have had better.   I might come here again next time I am in the area.

The Carnitas were wonderful chunks of pork that had been flash fried so crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. There were only 3 good-sized chunks which I thought was too little at first, but plenty in the end. We may have found  our \"go-to\" for Mexican close by.",

With that said, let me speak on what I ordered:  Fresh Quacamole Queso con Chorizo  House margaritas (Okay, I ordered a Pitcher-- Don't JUDGE ME!   Beef fajita with tortillas de maiz, cause a REAL MEXICAN, will only eat maiz...  The fresh quacamole was prepared table side. Nice touch! It was fresh, not overly dressed with lime.  RECOMMENDED  The queso was the highlight of the meal. When a Tapa outshines the main course... You know it's gonna be GREAT.  I was not disappointed.  And now the Fajitas.... Great caramelization, great flavor and well balanced with onions, green peppers and charred jalapenos. Again, it's a MEXICAN thing...   MY ONLY COMPLAINT... The tortillas should have been warmed on a comal, instead of being steamed...  WOULD DEFINITELY EAT HERE AGAIN... This time to sample the Mole!   Hope this review helps...",

If wishes were fishes we'd all eat well. As it was, we ate passably.  Like many mexican restaurants they started us off with chips and salsa, which came in two forms, standard red and corn. I hoped the latter would wow me, but it was pretty bland. But, hey, it was free.  The drinks, on the other hand, were most certainly not at $9 a piece. I know better than to order anything containing the ingredient \"margarita mix\" but i let the spirit get the best of me and ended up with a overly sweet cherry drink that may once have made the brief acquaintance of some tequila.  For our entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas Verde and he got the Fajitas de Casa. To their credit, both were so generously portioned that we ended up unable to finish. The chicken in the enchiladas was tasty, but the sauce was bland, especially when I spread the allotment of sour cream over them before realizing it was far too much (and I rarely admit such a situation exists). He enjoyed the mix of proteins in the fajitas but I tried one of the shrimp and found it unpleasant, so the seasoning is for some but not all palettes. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it was also unremarkable.  The service did meet the standard I had originally expected, with both servers that came to our table being prompt and friendly.  I really did want to be able to write a glowing review of 1900 Mexican, but as it turned out, I won't claim to never be returning, but next time I plan on dropping decent money on Mexican, I am likely to try somewhere else.",

Top Sirloin can't even be eaten well done. Oh and they served Cactus salad with it. UUUUGGGGHHHHH...... Anyway,  I was going to \"play\" with it and pay for it.

You choose two items from a list of about 7 selections including burritos, hard or soft tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tamals, or tostadas and it is served with rice and beans.    Overall the quality may be one notch higher than your standard mexican restaurant that many of us have grown accustomed to in the south. You are also paying a little more for this great location.  If there is anything that stands out to me about this place it has to be their shredded beef that you can get stuffed in just about anything on the menu.  It's delicious!  I have not visited their other location so I cannot compare the two.",

It's hard to beat that on a summer night.  I always order the Tacos Fundidos with steak.  Others in our group order a smattering, and the food is always good.  This is not the \"most authentic\" mexican food in the world, but it certainly is pretty great.  However, I will concede that the margaritas here are marginal at best.  But as a beer drinker, that doesn't bother me.  The place is very kid accomodating, as we will often bring the young kids with us.  All in all, we thoroughly enjoy our experiences here.",

We waited quite a long time, but nothing that a \"sorry about the wait\" couldn't have smoothed over.  When she finally came to our table she didn't welcome us or introduce herself, she took our drink order, then came back & took our food order.  Cheese dip came (delivered by a runner), thick and pasty & tasteless.  We had to ask for more salsa (we thought that adding some to the cheese dip might help it), the server we flagged for the salsa then noticed we were out of bevs & refilled our drinks.  A runner also brought our food, I had the arroz con pollo with vegetables $11.50.  Bland chicken, bland overcooked vegetables smothered in tasteless cheese over rice with a side of sour cream and tasteless pico de gallo.  My friend had a salad with chicken, she said the chicken was ok, but the salad was soggy.  We wait for a long time for the table to be cleared, when our server finally came to the table she asked \"you want a box for the queso?\" (which was hardly touched) & when we emphatically said \"NO!\"  she never asked \"was anything wrong?\". (Note that there was not an opportunity to complain to her since we did not see her from the time she delivered the queso to the time she cleared the plates).  She delivered the checks, didn't say even so much as \"thanks for coming\".  I tipped her $3 cash on a bill of $17.  I wrote her a note on the bill: \"I tip you as as a recognition of how hard a job it is to work in food & bev. Your service is terrible though.\"  Or words close to that effect.  There's nothing she can do about the poor food - but the poor service is inexcusable",

Started off with tableside guacamole; we got the smaller size ($7) and it was plenty for two.  Burrito combination plate was very good, and the carnitas were excellent.  Very large chunks of pork compared to other places, and the meat was super tender.  Some of the better corn tortillas I've had also - they were thinner and didn't taste dough-ey.  Not sure if that is a word...you know what I mean.  They have over 50 different kinds of tequila, and offer flights so you can taste three different kinds if you like.  Flights are $16.  Great atmosphere, friendly, and very clean.  I would definitely go back.",

Starters wise- The cheese dip is a good sized portion. So is the guac... and it's made is made table side. To put it in perspective for you: with a group of five girls we did both of these. We still had guac leftover.   I hope the tacos fundidos do not go away permanently with the new menu. I don't want to pick a new go-to. If so, fajitas it is then.  Parking is available on the street. Just make sure to pay attention to the meters. There's also a lot across from Nothing But Noodles.  I like this location a lot better than its counterpart on Park Road.

There was undoubtedly no flavor in that ground beef.   In fact, this is the second time we've been here, the first I ordered fajitas, cheap chicken chunks. It was lukewarm, and not served on a sizzling plate as in traditional fajitas. I wouldn't be surprised if they microwaved it because it was a lackluster  I ordered fries on the side with my tacos and rice; it was to substitute the \"bean paste\", that will be $1.50 extra, which means the beans are so cheap they're nearly free. Honestly, the fries were seasoned, and that was the best item I ate. Now only if I were in an all-American pub, then it'd be worth the visit, but let's not forget this is a Mexican restaurant and an attempt at being authentic, but it horribly failed.

You can pretty much mix and match whatever you want. Tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas and more...and it's all for a very reasonable prices.   I went with Amy C's suggestion and got the chimichangas. One beef and one chicken, the combo comes with rice and beans.   My food arrived quickly. The chimichangas are pretty small but I did love how they were coated in the cheese sauce. First thing I notice is that they didn't skimp on the filling, both of my chimichangas were packed with well flavored meat. Overall, it was very tasty. The rice and beans (covered in cheese) were just a little blah, but overall it still makes for a good meal.   Next trip...I will be having some table side guacamole because it looked delicious and of course I have to try the cheese dip!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and myself met our realtor and her assistant after work to discuss a few items. We arrived at 6:00pm on a Monday night and it was mostly empty. We immediately got a seat by the bar at one of the high top tables. Our server was kind, but I believe he had a little bit of difficultly understanding us. We ordered drinks (2 margs)  and decided what we wanted to eat, while we waited on those. It took hardly 5 minutes to get our drinks- super quick service! And we had the same experience with our food, we waited probably just 10 minutes before our food arrived.   It was delicious! I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo and it was perfect, it was served on a very hot plate so it kept it's heat throughout the entire meal. As we were chatting with our realtor more people began to fill the restaurant and the noise level started to increase, we started to have to raise our voices a little to hear one another. So I would assume once all the tables are filled it might get pretty noisy. We left around 7:30pm so we weren't there very late.   We'll definitely be coming back here for the yummy food! Probably just after work though as I'd rather not shout to be heard. Although there is patio seating so during warmer weather you may be able to sit outside and avoid the noise.",

    "text": "TERRIBLE. JUST AWFUL!! When I arrived 15 min late for the birthday party, the other guests were just getting served water after being there since 7:30. Chips and salsa were already on the table, and not a drop to drink? They started to place drink orders and I was confused...in all the restaurants I've ever worked if you did not SERVE the drinks within 5 min, you were in trouble! But no matter, let's have fun...once we finally got the drinks and appetizers (reservation at 7:30 to go to a show at 9:00 down the street - should have been more than enough time) at 8:00, we placed our food order. A different server came to our table each time. It was almost comical! We had to bus our own table to make room. We finally called the manager over and he just said they were really busy. The restaurant was full, but it was a Sat nite, we were a large party that called ahead, and they were just so completely disorganized. Amazingly, once the orders finally came out (9:00), they were relatively correct. Mine was cold, though others were hot so it was clear mine was ready long before. The food was okay, nothing particularly special. Certainly not worth that kind of a wait! The manager offered to take off 1 round of drinks and the guacamole.  The least they could do!! He was clear to point out only ONE round. Got it. Then it was time for the bill...oh boy! You guessed it - one check. I get that restaurants sometimes have a policy about splitting checks or whatever, but there were 10 of us, any decent server would have asked ahead of time just to avoid major confusion!! So, we were left to fig it out on our own. Easier said than done. Some had cash and needed change, some cards, etc. Just a nightmare from beginning to end. Finally left about 9:45, missed the 2 opening acts, but made it for the headliner. Will not ever go there again!! Save your money and time!!",

It was early so we each had a house margarita which to be honest with you was better than some of the restaurants so called  top shelf margaritas. We decided to eat light and made a perfectly delicious choice. Sharing the Sopa de Limon which was generous and perfect for the day. Mole Pablano was the entree and it was perfect all the way around, I love Mole but usually cannot stand the after taste. Had a delicious meal, topped off with a huge piece of tres leche cake we fought over it ended up taking a piece home with us! Much better visit this time the last time I had to deal with the lady sitting next to us outside on the patio with her dog on the table which I think up all her friends but the service seem to not know what to do about it so we left this time I have to say I enjoyed my visit.",

We have sent entrees back because they were just warm. Tonight our waitress brought our plates to the table using the OVEN MITTS; telling us the plates were very hot. I could pick up the plates with my hands! The food temperature was palatable. There is no reason why these plates (food) do not arrive at the table absolutely steaming hot! We will be back but if my food comes out any temperature below 140...it's going back!",

There appeared to be quite a few staff on duty, but only one waitress covering the tables. I should note that it was lunch time on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty empty.  Maybe they would have been more motivated if it was busier? All in all I would say worth the stop if you have plenty of time.",

I'll delete the below once the fod redeems itself   I had to find my Yelp PW to make this review. I ordered nachos & requested CHIPS ON SIDE due to time and soggy factors. Picked up, no chips on side. Ok, I'm starving but Idw to be totally disappointed so I go back in, the bartender rudely asked if I \"actually asked for chips on the side.\" Duh, check YOUR system. She passes it off to a server & doesn't talk to me again until 10 min later when my new order comes out. Her attitude was trash & Idk if they took it personal that MY food was wrong or what, but they put EVERYTHING in separate containers and left out my beans-the reason I wanted nachos itfp! Seriously?! It's not the 1st time and it sucks that Idw go back because 1900 used to be my spot! But seriously, SIX separate cups!? Y'all were being smart @$$#$ because nobody said separate everything and I was overly polite to them as if I'D messed up my own order or smtg. Do better.",

I informed him it took forever to have our food brought to the table (no apology for slow service) and that I couldn't wait as I was on my lunch.

They were playing Reggae music the night I was in so that was a little odd.  The menu is short compared to other Mexican restaurants. The complimentary chips and salsa didn't arrive until after I had ordered so not sure if that's a regular practice or not. Most other Mexican places, they are there as soon as you sit down. The chips were decent but the salsa had an odd flavor to it that I couldn't pinpoint what it was.  For an entree I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole.  The highlight here was the mole which was amazing. Everything else was meh on this plate.  The enchiladas were like a folded tortilla, not rolled. The beans were nothing special and the rice was the worst thing of all with absolutely no flavor. I had to mix in the mole and beans to give it something.  Service was average and nothing really stood out.  So for Mole, I'd give them a 4 which allows this review to average out to a 3. Worth trying but not sure I'll be back since there are plenty of other Mexican places around.",

The interior and decor is nice, had a darker atmosphere. Our server was less than friendly and didn't really say much. She also seemed rushed despite it being an hour before closing but, I guess I get that. But, I didn't appreciate that she didn't bring out the chips and salsa until after we asked her for them. Chips and salsa are Mexi food staples. The chips were good, not great, and the salsa was only meh, they need salsa tips from On the Border.   The bf ordered the chimichanga enchilada combo for $9.50 and I ordered the mole enchiladas for $13. Our food came out surprisingly quick. The bf like his chicken chimi, it had good, white chicken pieces and an ok size portion of queso while the enchilada was a little dry, it tasted pretty good, even their regular rojo enchilada sauce was good. The mole sauce on my dish was very good, definitely hit the chocolate notes with some spice, I just wish there was a little more spice. The chicken inside was also flavorful and seasoned. I loved the consistency of the beans but, the rice was weak sauce. The Spanish rice was really bland for me. For $13, there needs to be more food or the dish needs a price reduction. It's good for $11 max.",

I've been here a few times and typically order vegetarian entrees (enchiladas, quasedillas, salads). My husband tends to order beef or pork dishes. Each time we've come we've had leftovers that go bad in the fridge because we're just not interested in them. That is a really bad sign in our house. The last time we came here the service was mediocre. The wait staff was nice (when we saw them), but I basically had to shout someone down for water after getting zero refills in the 15 minutes my glass was empty and sitting at the end of the table. It really wasn't that busy, so I wonder if they are just that under-staffed. I don't think I'll eat here again, but I may come for a drink with friends. The bar and outdoor patio are the best parts of the restaurant.",

They were offering select tacos for $2.50 and also had Margaritas on special for $5. I got the veggie, chicken and al pastor tacos. I was very impressed with the size of the tacos and the amount of filling. My favorite was the veggie taco. It was loaded with a mix of sauteed vegetables and even had guac on it.   Although the food did take a while to come out (there was a few big parties), I thought the food was fresh - however if you're looking for a quick bite to each you might want to go elsewhere.  Like I mentioned, I've been here a few other times other than for Taco Tuesday. The food has always been decent, but it's not my first choice for Mexican in the city. It's average, but not amazing. 1900 is a place I would return to, but would probably not suggest as my top choice.   Note- they are on open table so if you're coming here with a large group I would recommend that you make a reservation through that app.",

The food is good, but over priced for tex mex food. We all agreed we'd rather go to Sabor down the street for better food, especially considering that the table service lacked as much as it did.

The service has improved and the food is delicious. Maria is a lovely waitress that makes us smile. Im not sure what some of the other commenters are looking for. It's not Taco Bell and it's not fine dinning. It's authentic Mexican food in a fantastic atmosphere. Two thumbs up!",

This place needs some work on this dish. The pork should be tender and juicy, with crispy parts from being on the griddle. Instead it's like they cut the pork shoulder and threw chunks right into the deep fryer. The meat is tough and lacks flavor. There's nothing authentic and no love put into this dish. I give it 1 star.   My second visit I was torn between two authentic dishes, the mole and the huitlacoche enchiladas. For those not familiar with huitlacoche, it's a black fungus that grows on corn. It's a rare find on menus in the states, but has an earthy, mushroom like quality to it. I chose the huitlacoche dish with a poblano cream sauce and it was actually pretty good. I give it 4 stars.   They offer churros with Nutella and ice cream here and they were a nice way to finish the meal. I'm sure I'll venture back with friends in the future. Perhaps the mole will bring them up to a solid 4 stars.",

Our server was great. She tried her best with our large party. Staff did refill our chips and waters regulatory. Maybe I'll try again... in a while...",

    "text": "Not a good experience. Took the family after church today. Chips were just ok, salsa was super runny, like a bowl of watered down salsa with hardly any tomatoes. Ordered fish tacos and it was the kind of fish you get in the frozen section at the grocery store, fried. Topped with a small amount of tomatoes and a little slaw, and doused with sauce. Came with refried beans that weren't tasty and a side of rice that was bland and not good. My husband got a mix of hard and soft beef tacos with the same two sides, they are kind of standard. He was not at all impressed with his food either. Got two kids meals and those were no good either. Honestly it's hard to believe how this place is staying in business. Walking out there was a couple on the sidewalk thinking about eating there who asked me how it was. I said not too good and they thanked me and kept going. Certainly won't be going back and will not give any positive reviews on this place! I hate that we spent the money we did, definitely our loss. :-(",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were driving around last night and trying to decide where to eat when we came upon 1900 Mexican Grill. We were a bit leary as we'd not heard much about this place and felt like we would have if it was any good. Since I had a Citipass coupon, and we were both getting crabby because we were hungry, we decided to check it out.  The atmosphere is a bit generic but there were a ton of tables inside; it is much bigger than you'd expect. There was a bar in the back and quite a few of the tables were taken, but we were led promptly to a booth. Chips and salsa immediately arrived and they were pretty good. I decided to start with the orange pineapple crush, which was delicious but a bit pricey at $9. I saw a happy hour menu with prices listed that were the same as the regular menu, but they did have drink specials ($2.50 bottles of Mexican beer on Thursday nights).   Our server, Karen C, was quite attentive (without being annoying) and even helped me choose my beverage. We got the guacamole made tableside ($9) and it was actually very good; I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars for how fresh it tasted. My boyfriend got the Enchiladas Verdes ($13), which came with only rice, so he had to order a side of refried beans (which ended up being enough refried beans for about four people). Being quite the enchilada aficianado, he said he enjoyed these. I ordered the fajita quesadilla, which was very good as well, but huge. I ended up eating a1/3 of it and plan to eat the rest for lunch AND dinner today...three meals for $10 is a great deal in my book.    Ultimately, if you just have to have some Mexican and Cantina 1511 is on a two hour wait (as they are frequently on weekends), this is a solid back-up choice. Plenty of parking available in the lots behind and across the street.",

On each visit, the waitstaff has been attentive and quick to fill water and tea glasses, as well as offering the next beer or margarita.  Speaking of drinks, I had the best big ginger (whiskey, ginger ale) I've had in Charlotte, despite it being a decidedly odd drink order for a Mexican cantina.  I should say, we find the ambiance to be a large part of the charm. When you look up, you'll notice high ceilings and a wall of elaborate, colorful Mexican wrestler masks. The theme is continued on the small LCD television screens that adorn some booth walls, where a crazy, strange zombie/vampire/dwarf/Mexican wrestler movie shows on a loop. We found the latter immensely entertaining, but can't say with certainty that they show anything other than the movie on these TVs. Sports fans, you may want to call ahead if you're wanting to catch the big game.",

My wife said she had not heard anything positive about this place but I wanted to give it a try to support a neighborhood business. We should have known better seeing the menus as soon as were seated. They were totally trashed, peeling plastic on the edges and parts unreadable. The service was very slow despite only five tables being occupied at 6 on Thursday night. It is honestly no better than Taco Bell. Average food at best. The $11 house margarita was right out of a mix and pretty flavorless. Bland salsa. Fajitas served on plates---barely warm. To top it off, next door is a bike store, which is very nice and a great addition to the neighborhood, but the outside patio of the bike shop had a bunch of PBR swilling, unemployed BMX / skateboarders who looked to be in their early to mid 20s. Smoking, climbing trees in front of the restaurant, dodging traffic and the streetcar on bikes and skateboards.... Made for a great spring evening with my family on the patio next door. I should have listened to my wife and gone to RURU but I wanted to support a local business in Elizabeth. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but I should have trusted my instincts---why wasn't a place with a killer patio not totally packed on a spring 70 degree Thursday evening? Clearly, the crowds read the bad reviews and stayed away. We won't be returning.",

Started with the Sangria which was a little to sweet for me. I wouldnt have believe there was red wine in it- and despite its large size and my empty stomach id say they were on the weak side.   We first asked for Guacamole and our server asked us if we would like it table-side and if we wanted one avocado or two. We gave him our answer but we were never given our Guacamole. When our meals came out I assumed he must have forgotten so I asked for it again and he came back and asked the same questions as he did previously, almost acting like we had never originally asked for it...no apology either. I will say once we did receive it I really enjoyed it.   My enchiladas were nothing special - it was quite a sad dish really. Nothing tasted fresh nothing was exciting about the dish.  I am not sure that id go back. I love Cantina and La Paz and this restaurant cannot compete in my opinion.",

It was a quiet Tuesday evening and the weather was perfect for sitting outside. The view of Uptown was perfect. We chose our Kryptonite and it was a pitcher of Margaritas on special. We were like Superman and folded after the first one. It was delicious!   A few of us ordered meals and the food was good. All of us being Latino and growing up with Mom & Grandma's cooking makes us a little tough to please but this certainly passed. I would definitely go back for more. This may become our new hangout after our meetings. :)  The wait staff was fabulous. They were so helpful in pulling a bunch of tables together for us quickly without disturbing the other diners and were quick to bring out the chips and salsa as soon as we were seated. They got all of our orders right and we were more than happy with their suggestions. BRAVO!",

    "text": "1900 Mexican Grill offers great traditional Mexican foods.  The location on Elizabeth Ave managed (thankfully!) to survive the year-plus-long trolley rail road construction (for the non-existent trolley!).  The dining room area is beautiful, with high ceilings, nicely themed decor, and great lighting.  It feels like a higher-class Mexican restaurant, but still with very reasonable regular-restaurant pricing.    We went early on a Friday night and were immediately seated (without a reservation).  The later it got, the more the dining room filled up, so we were glad we went earlier with our party of six.    The free chips and salsa served seem fresher and more homemade than some Mexican restaurants.  You're given a sampler of regular salsa, hot salsa, and corn salsa.     In the past, I've ordered the enchiladas, a giant-sized smothered burrito, or one of dishes with mole sauce.  I opted for something different this time around:  Tacos de Carne Asada.  It was three doubled moist corn tortillas with carne asada with rice and homemade hot sauce on the side.  They're supposed to resemble Mexican street cart style tacos.  I think it's one of my new favorites.  I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas (I prefer flour), but the flavor of the meat offset my aversion to the corn tortillas, and the double layering of the tortillas helped hold together corn tortillas that normally fall apart.  The hot sauce was very flavorful, chunky, and OH-SO-HOT.  Don't get me wrong, I love spicy foods, but this even pushed my limits.  That's when I ordered some water on the side of my Diet Coke.  Yum, though!   I normally don't care for the semi-bland Mexican rice (unless I dump the leftover salsa on it), but the mildness of the rice helped cool down the tacos in this case!  If not for gorging myself with the chips, this would have been the perfect-sized entree to fill me up, but not make me feel too full (mostly because there were no beans,  cheese, or other heavy foods).    Our server was right on top of things, too, so we had a fantastic experience.    p.s. They have a huge tequila menu, too, for you tequila connoisseurs!",

You get regular salsa, as well as a pico de gallo-type corn salsa.  Delicious, and with free refills.  -Appetizer.  We got the cheese dip.  This was very good, even though I suspect it was from a jar.  Still, it's pretty hard to mess up cheese dip.  -Bevs.  It being Sunday, margaritas were $3.  They were fine.  For $3.  a bit weak, but again, $3.  I noticed that some very good drink specials were featured on other days of the week, including a $2 pint night on Fridays.  -Entrees.  I had the \"Fajita Salad,\"  for $10 with carne asada.  The steak was a little bland, but the rest of the salad really made up for it.  The taco shell was still warm, and the salad didn't have an overly large amount of the shredded iceberg so common to taco salads.  There was a generous amount of cheese, sour cream, and the \"good\" type of jalapeno (not too spicy, kelly green).  My boyfriend ordered the \"pick three\" combo for $9.25.  It came with three items of your choice (enchilada, taco, etc) as well as rice and beans.  Service.  Our waitress was very attentive and prompt.  All in all, this place is worth a visit.  On a side note, they feature probably more than 80 tequilas.",

Their chips and salsa are pretty great, but their guacamole is amazing.  We haven't done the table-side yet (even the small appetizer you can get made at the table looks too big for 2 people to eat), but the small side order is the perfect size.  The first time I came, I had a combo plate with a chimichanga and a tamal.  The tamal was just all right, but it did have a fair amount of filling compared to some of the others.  The chimichanga, however, was fabulous.  I loved the flavors in the filling and it was the perfect size.  My partner ordered the carnitas, which were perfectly moist and flavorful.  Last time we came, I ordered the carnitas tacos, which came with their own smoky sauce, which added some great flavor to the tacos.  My partner ordered the carne asada, which he declared to be the best he'd ever had.  I loved the spices on it as well.  Like many Mexican restaurants here, they have a large selection of tequilas for tequila tastings or for your margaritas.   The dining room is fairly sizable and they have a few tables available out on the patio.  I have never been here when it is completely full, but I can only imagine how loud that is.  It was a little over half full on our last trip, and I could barely converse across the table.  We also had a table right in front of the bar, which added even more noise.  I swear they have one of the loudest blenders I have ever heard in my life.  The acoustics in this place are quite lacking.  Service has been pretty good both times and the prices are pretty reasonable.  They have good food for a good price, but beware of the noise level if you go at a busy time or get seated near the bar.",

    "text": "Review for Cinco De Mayo festivities at 1900.   There were a gaggle of people when I rolled up. Got lucky..and found parking right away. Big ol' tent on the lawn with satellite bar. Beer pong table busy. Two cornhole games set up. Sizeable stage with band in the back. Throngs of people with beers in hand just chilling. Inside, tons of people hanging around the bar, tables filled. Took a while for the bartender to get to us, but she was quick getting my gigantic can of Tecate.   Festivity-wise, could've been more festive. Band kind of sucked. Still, it was fun to just hang out with peeps on a lawn with large beer in hand.   Perhaps I will visit this place for a normal meal one of these days.",

The guacamole is made in front of you, a staple for any Mexican restaurant that wants to be a player in the game!  Also, the pancho villa candle is a nice touch, a slight minus was the waiter could not tell me who Pancho villa was. All good. #IGoogledIt  I ordered the mole shredded chicken plate and subbed the rice for more vegetables, no problem. #Paleo  Nice place, will go back.",

Usually go to 3 Amigos, but this place has been consistently beating it in quality, price, and taste.  Their queso actually has some substance to it (3 amigos tends to be watery).  I usually get the grilled chicken salad and the chicken is very tender and fresh.  Great fresh avocado and the dressing is tasty too.  I wish they gave a little more salsa with their to-go order, but I'll bet they would do it if I asked.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that the food was good.  Nice portions and tasty.   We went on a Monday night so there wasn't a crowd, but the service seemed to be somewhat slow. Our server was friendly, but it took a little while to get someone to come over after being seated. My fiance had been here a couple times and really enjoyed it. The server recommended a new lager and an IPA. I ordered the lager.  He came back a little while later to inform me they were out of that specific beer. Fine. I noticed the dos Equis signs hanging and asked for that lager. Also out. I said ok, I'll just have a corona. After a bit, the server informed me that they no longer carry corona, nor dos Equis, and haven't for a year. He then recommended a Pacifico to which I agreed. No beers were listed on the menu only the tequilas, which is great, but it's Monday and I was not in a tequila mood. All of this could have been avoided if the beers were listed on the menu. Don't hang signs of beers you don't carry. Maybe its just me, but I like the Mexican-American beers when I have Mexican food.  Finally my bill showed I was charged for the lager that wasn't available. Something seemed off, but because the food was decent we may be back.",

    "text": "I absolutely love 1900.    As a frequent flyer of all cheap Mexican restaurants I was a little hesitant at the $9.00 margaritas.  However considering the couple of entrees that I have had, the chips and salsa, and their rather large (and intimidating) tequila list....it is definitely worth it.   We've been a couple of times and I've had the taco salads, enchiladas, and chimichangas.  Holy chimichanga.  It was incredible. They put some kind of homemade cheese sauce on it that I would probably bathe in given the chance.    Also, if he is in ask to sit in Oscar's section.  He knows everything there is to know about their drink menu, including the best and the interesting.  We met him one night when we came in on a Tuesday at 9ish (they close at 10).  While we broke the cardinal rule of week night dining Oscar did not make us feel rushed at all. He told us to take our time and chatted it up with us until we were finished.    He even gave us the secrets to getting a good table there for Cinco de Mayo...which I will not be sharing.  I definitely recommend this place and plan on going back regularly.  The food amazing, drinks delish, and chips and salsa some of the best I've had.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of 1900.  The place is clean and pretty swanky for a cheap Mexican restaurant.  They have good drinks and I would hope so since they claim to be a Tequila Bar.  The margaritas I've had were good, albeit expensive.  We were there last Saturday night and they had $10 AYCD sangria.  I was so pumped when she said that.  It was Saturday too, get outta here!!  I walked out with a nice little buzz, so I'm happy to report that the sangria wasn't all mixer.  The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had in Charlotte.  They have quite a kick, so I think they might add jalapenos...a good thing.  I've had better queso, but I still swiped every last bite of cheese out of the bowl.  As for the meal, I split a 3 entree combo with my girlfriend.  It was $9.50 for a burrito, chimichanga, and a tamal.  The chimichangas here are great, crispy and topped with queso.  Burrito and tamal had good consistency, but lacked spice.  It's ok though, I threw on some Cholula and it was perfect.  We were stuffed for spending only $14 on food between 2 people.  I'm sure all those sangria refills helped as well!",

I have to note than I hail from Texas, and I didn't think the chips and salsa were quite as exciting as other reviewers have mentioned... That, however, didn't stop me from eating a good basket or two while I waited for my entree. (I'm a sucker for these types of starters at any restaurant!) :P  I had the Combo Two with a shredded beef chimichanga (at the recommendation of fellow Yelpers) and a chicken enchilada.The pico de gallo is a must-request with the combo dishes.  It was fresh and delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal! Again, I wasn't blown away by the chimichanga despite the rave reviews, but I enjoyed it along with the enchilada and found the meal to be quite satisfying overall.  As a whole package (ambiance+food+service), the experience was great and I would definitely go back. I have my eye on the carnitas for next time.",

The set up plate was sour cream, lettuce, a dab of pico, and the worst rice i have ever had!!!  Bland !! And this dish was $14. Needless to say i will never go back.",

I loved the table salsa it had a slight kick and was very fresh. I do have the agree the spinach in the spinach Queso was less than fresh- but not so off putting that we didn't finish the dish or maybe i was just hungry. I ordered the Carnitas. The meat was juicy, grilled perfection. The sides are typical- just a tiny scoop of guacamole was offered. Overall- everything is pretty solid here- medium priced- nothing ridiculous like Vida in the EpiCentre but not Central Ave cheap either. However, $14 margarita pitcher earns this place an extra star- but I guess just on Tuesdays!",

It's certainly no better than your run of the mill Azteca, Monterrey, etc.  Keeping that in mind, my second reason for not being a fan is that I find that the dishes here are priced a little on the high side for a standard Mexican restaurant.  I like the decor of this location a little better than the Park Road location but that didn't make up for the lack luster food and the barely acceptable service provided.  If I'm looking for a quick Mexi-fix, Loco Lime or Azteca is still my go to choice!",
