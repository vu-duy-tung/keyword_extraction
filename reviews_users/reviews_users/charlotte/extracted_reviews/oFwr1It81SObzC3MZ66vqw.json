    "text": "I went to this restaurant about a week ago and was thoroughly disappointed. After reading the reviews, I was really expecting a nice dinner out. First of all, it's a very small establishment. Don't be fooled by the pictures you see online like I was. The service is what killed the whole experience from the start. I don't know if its a cultural thing, but the wait staff was terrible. Not personable at all. The beef patty and the jerk chicken wings were pretty good. My main meal was the curry chicken. It was nothing to rave about. The rice & beans that came with it tasted like they had been burnt in the pot they were cooked in. Or as my friend, who joined me described, \"they tasted like an ashtray\". Disgusting right?! They did have a live band playing, and they were good but the place is just too small to enjoy your meal and listen to music in. We couldn't hear each other talking at all. And again, it's a really small place, so we should've been able to. I consider myself a foodie type person, and I don't see myself ever returning to this place.",

The chicken was hard, dry and cold. It wasn't fresh.  It was pulled from the fridge and put in the microwave. The beans were hard and rice chewy. The collard greens were bland. Very disappointing.

There are four or five tables, a small bar with imported and domestic beer and booze.  Up front there are speakers and I am told that they have an open mike night.  I ask them how they would feel about me singing Danny Boy or Vintage Hank Senior.  He said \"bring it on\".  This place has a ways to go to iron out some of the kinks. Please Please some one give them help with a web site. The food? What we had ( three of us)  was absolutely fantastic.  The best Jerk Chicken I have ever tasted. (very spicy)  Curry Shrimp (Very large portion) very spicy and delicious.  We also had rice and beans, collard greens the best steamed cabbage that I have had in some time,  and boiled bananas and yams.  These are not yams as in sweet potatoes but some Caribbean variant.  There are a number of call ahead specialty items (Callalou, Fry Dumplings among others.   Something called Roti, Oxtail, Curry Goat and many other fascinating items.  My friend who bummed around Jamaica for a time assured me that this was the real deal.  I hope they iron out some of their problems so that they remain in business.  The clientele when we were there was mostly Jamaican.  I loved every thing I tried and will certainly go back soon. Oh every thing is available as carry out and they advertise a $4.99 lunch special.",

When we finally tracked down a waitress and asked basic questions about the menu (e.g. does the roti have potatoes?) the waitress said she didn't know and made no effort to find out.  The \"roti\" was a horrible mess of some kind of non-roti type of bread that was way too hard and think to be called anything but a pita.  No AC and it was 95 degrees today, so we were doing some extra sweating from the jerk sauce.   It had a 95 cleanliness rating, not horrible, I guess, but certainly not stellar.  Can't think of any reason to visit this place again.",

I guess because of where it is located it is kind of obscure if you're not actually looking for it.   I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  I ordered a shrimp dish and my friend got the lunch special which REMAINS $4.99! ( I see it was the same price in 2010 according to a previous  review.  Amazing!)  There really IS a \"Mama\" and she is the sole cook.  She is a very nice older woman with strikingly attractive features and a wonderful lilting Jamaican accent. Our waitress was a  nice young American girl, who seemed to have a genuine almost \"family\" type relationship with \"Mama.\"  We felt very welcome and comfortable there.  It has the kind of relaxed environment that you'll enjoy when you just want to get away from the rat race for a tranquil respite.  The prices are good, and  our meals were delicious.  The Jamaican tea had just the right amount of citrusy sweetness to satisfy my sugar cravings, but  in a more healthy way than drinking a soda.    I'm looking forward to eating there again, and would recommend it to  anyone who is in that area and wants to try a different restaurant.",

He then began to talk to me and he was a very nice guy, I believe someone on the phone was screwing with him.   I then asked him about playing some music b/c there were some sound boards up in the front; he said he forgot to turn the music on b/c he was reading a book.

The atmosphere was fine - the place is kind of a hole in the wall, with plenty of character and I have no problem with that. Kind of dark, cool stage area up front and cute little bar in the back.  Sort of felt like walking into someones house, and I like that feeling. We sat ourselves and the server was nice. No complaints so far. I ordered brown stew chicken and my partner ordered jerk chicken. Rice and peas and macaroni and cheese. Now, jerk chicken is grilled after being coated with a dark jerk spice marinade, if being done super legit, its grilled over coal. What arrived looked like it came out of a crock pot. Imagine if you ordered a flame grilled burger and someone brought you a sloppy joe type thing in a bowl.  That was definitely NOT jerk chicken. I'm surprised they were trying to pass it off as such.  It was sort of bland, mushy. My brown stew chicken was more legit, but was still bland. The stewed chicken was dry, almost hard in the middle. Really weird. Where's the scotch bonnet heat? Rice and peas was pretty good, the mac and cheese was unmemorable and sort of yellow and grainy. I hope they turn it around, but it's evident that someone here just doesn't care. Sad.",

I've had the real deal in Jamaica and this took me back.  The jerk chicken is perfect.  Just enough spice to keep things interesting.  Rice and beans included and the small comes with an additional side.  I got 2 small jerk chickens, one with mac and cheese and the other with sweet potatoes (or yams?)  Both were great, but I'll be getting the yams next time.  If ya cravin' real Jamaican jerk chicken, no problem mon.  Ya found it here.",

    "text": "Two stars are for the waitress and Mama. Unfortunately not the food. Not the worst I've had but definitely disappointing.   Where do I begin? This was a recommendation from a friend of a friend. She said it's better than Caribbean Hut over on Tryon street (which is far from me). I thought great....there's  nothing like having a favorite restaurant closer to home. So I met up with three girlfriends. We got there on a Saturday around 12:30 PM. Turns out the restaurant doesn't open up till 1 PM.  Fine..we'll just stand outside and talk for a few. 1 o'clock comes around and the young lady who's the hostess/waitress opens the door. Before we even sat down, she begins to tell us that they have no brown rice..just white rice. They also have no curry chicken, no brown stewed chicken and no black beans! I mean seriously... you are just opening up, and it's a Saturday and you don't have all those menu items?  Come on now!! That alone should've been a red flag but we were all gung ho for Caribbean food.   We were the first ones there so we sat down at a table and was brought over menus.  I already knew I wanted oxtails and my other friend knew she wanted oxtails also. The other two looked over the menu but only took a minute or two to figure it out. One ordered jerk pork, the other fish. So we sat and we sat waiting for her to come back to take our order. Now, remember the place just opened up. It's really not that busy. But there  were a few people at the bar getting to go orders. After waiting possibly 15 minutes, the waitress comes back and takes our orders.  At this point of time, she was the only waitress there. Maybe as the day gets busier, they have another one or two. She was nice. She seemed kind of cold when we got there but warmed up later. Finally our orders arrived. I think it was Mama herself who carried them out. She seemed like a very nice older woman.  I had ordered plantains for an appetizer, but they didn't arrive until after the entree.  They were fine but plantains are plantains. It's kind of hard to screw those up.   Now I love me some oxtails, and I was so looking forward to ordering another order or two to take home, but these weren't worth the wait or money. Usually the oxtails I've had at Jamaican restaurants have been so well seasoned and fall off the bone tender. These were just OK. I found the white rice kind of mushy.  The sweet potatoes weren't good and definitely from a can. I knew as soon as I saw them, they were from a can. The collard greens were nothing special. My friend who ordered the fish seemed to like hers. She wanted dessert, but guess what?  They didn't have any dessert.   After  all is said and done, I really wanted to like this place but there was nothing there that would make me want to go back or recommend. I think I'll stick with the other Jamaican restaurant.  It may be further from me, but definitely worth the drive.",

The Brown Chicken was amazing, just like I remember and the plantains...oh my, like candy with just a hint of fried delicious crust....oh yeah.  The man had the jerk pork, also perfection....just enough heat to make you notice but not uncomfortable.  They have Sorrel which I didn't get to try but for will next time.

    "text": "I've walked by the front door on my way to browse stores nearby in Plaza Midwood and have thought a hundred times of stopping in. A friend of mine and I used to always talk of stopping into Mama's. Four years of playing \"we should do this\" later, we stopped in. And it was pretty good.  There's a lunch special was $4.95 for a curry chicken, but we opted on oxtail and Caribbean jerk chicken. The best way to describe the oxtail was being like a chewier pot roast, and pretty nice with the plate's included rice and beans. I know wanting to try someplace out for years builds a lot of hype, so my expectations for the jerk chicken might have unfairly been a little high. The spice mix Mama uses for the chicken is great, with enough punch to brighten up the poultry that's a bit dry. If you have trouble picking side dishes (I can be indecisive, or maybe not), opt for the collard greens instead of the sweet potatoes. The portion is bigger, and the flavor is fuller. On that note, portions are plentiful-the small size will fill you up without making you feel like the Goodyear blimp.  Some of the other reviews have mentioned cleanliness and service. When we first came in, we did a lot of \"taking in the sights.\" The sights were a gigantic DJ booth and a wall of speakers, for the music they have on the weekends (that created even more of a mythical status for Mama's). The place looks a little grungy, but since the plywood outside wasn't a problem, I didn't have a problem with the floor and tables looking a little messy.  A lot of folks swung by for take-out orders (I'd like to try that out) or even just for a chat. There was one guy explaining his plan for fixing all the world's troubles as a small group of people gathered. We were leaving as he was starting to speak; now I wish we had stayed for it all.",

On another occasion, placed a phone order for 2 dinners and arrived 20 minutes later only to be told they never prepared it and I would have to wait another 15 minutes (forget that they tell you it will take 15 minutes when you call in the order).   Right now I've been standing waiting for 5 minutes on the order I called in 25 minutes ago which I was told at the time would be ready in 15 minutes. There are 2 other patrons in the restaurant and 2 people working the counter/serving. So it isn't an issue of understaffing.   The ONLY reason this restaurant is still in business has to be because competition for decent, relatively authentic Caribbean food does not exist in Charlotte.   It is such a shame because I love the island-like, Caribbean feel of the restaurant and the food is really good, but you have to have a lot of patience to deal with them and definitely not be hungry when you decide to dine at Mama's Caribbean. Too bad they choose to limit themselves in this way.",

    "text": "We arrived around 12:45 today, a Wednesday. We were the only people in the restaurant, which should have been a red flag. The server told us to sit wherever, and brought us menus. We both ordered the small jerk chicken with Mac and cheese. Literally 3 minutes later, the food came out. That's when I knew it was microwaved. The rice was barely hot, the peas never arrived, the Mac and cheese was gross and also not hot, and there was very little chicken- definitely not enough for $9. The jerk sauce was essentially gravy with jerk seasoning that had been simmering in a pot all morning. It had a burnt flavor to it. The server had an attitude the whole time and had more attitude when we asked why the food was microwaved. The only good part was that the chicken was hot. Still, the food did not meet even low expectations and the service was horrible. We definitely will not be back.",

Mac and cheese was over cooked and lacked seasoning as well. The curry chicken neglected to have seasoning. They forgot to add my chicken pattie and coco bread to my order.  Mama was sitting near the kitchen and it was a total misrepresentation of her establishment. This is one of the FEW places in Charlotte to get authenticity and it failed the people miserably. This is the McDonald's of Caribbean food. Horrible. No substance. No soul.  I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.",

The waitress didn't even bring us water to swallow down that' nasty food.  My girlfriend didn't even touch her jerk chicken or macaroni and cheese..  There was a restaurant full of people and only one waitress, who clearly was trying her best, but it was a lot for her to handle alone..Then we had to pay 15.00 each for that dreadful food. Never again.  Be aware",

The waitress showed when we were about to leave so we decided to order. Food quality was terrible. I ordered Jerk pork (Caribbean food so it should be a staple). I had to ask for a knife as this was the hardest piece of meat I have come across in years. I could only cut one of the seven pieces of meat, and it was all fat that I could not swallow. Remainders were like pieces of rock. I gave up and ate the plantains which were decent. If you go here, I highly recommend the pizza at the place across the street.",

I asked for a side of jerk sauce to pour over my cold rice...miraculously that came out steaming... After sitting with a cold plate for 30 minutes. The waitress never returned so I went to the bar to pay for our meals.. I was given the 1 minute finger while she answered the phone and took an order for 15 minutes.

My family and I ordered Mama's for pickup. I, myself, had never eaten there and I usually like to eat at a location before considering takeout, but my momma was paying so I made an exception lol. Maya, who took our order and was extremely professional and thorough, accomplished the impossible by getting my super picky order correct. Now, that is an unusual gift that should be valued amongst the masses. She even wrote me a sweet note on my container(happy tear)!  See, I ordered a small curry goat, however, I like for there to be extra gravy on my goat, but ZERO gravy on my rice. Trippy right? I know. I don't do the rice smothered in gravy thing. Ever. Why? Because I like to combine flavors on my own terms. If the gravy to rice ratio is wrong..everything is wrong. Don't judge me.  The curry goat was super flavorful, perfectly balanced. The rice and peas were wonderful, the ideal texture. The greens were a little on the salty side, but that's an easy fix. All in all, my meal was scrumpdidilyuhmptious.  This is my new favorite Jamaican restaurant. Check them out!",

The temperature was quite warm inside, restaurant was decently clean, decor was cheap and tacky. If you want you arms to stick to a plastic table cloth, this is a great place for you.   So the food, ordering is interesting because every other thing you ask for you'll be told they're out of it. Had a chicken patty which is like their version of an empanada. It was flaky with good spice inside but odd texture to the meat. The jerk chicken, meh, not a ton of flavor and soft rubbery skin. Mac and cheese, be better off with something you microwave at home.   Just in case the crap food wasn't awesome enough, oh the service. If you want to be ignored, this is the place for you. If you want more water or another drink, well then you probably should have drank what you had slower because you're on your own. If you want to pay and leave, enjoy waiting 15 minutes to grab someone's attention. And when you have to audacity to not take a to go box and want to pay, they'll ask you to get away from the table while they work on getting the bill for another 10 minutes. One of the rudest places I've actually ever been. Don't go.",

I would NOT suggest going to this restaurant with more than anyone but yourself. Call your order in and pick it up because dining in you'll have the worst experience you've ever had. I watched them bring out one plate per table no matter how large or small the party, no matter what customer arrived first, everyone at each table in the restaurant was eating at different times. I watched some customers share plates until the other person's food came out while others had finished their plate while the other person didn't even have a plate yet. I went with a very large party of 10 plus, we were celebrating the arrival of a baby boy after a gender reveal on a Saturday night. We spent at least 3 hours here waiting on the last plate of food to come out. I read a response on a similar review experience to mine from the owner from 2018 that said they were under new management and things were different... I'm here to tell you one year later it aint! The manager refused to come out when we requested so we were left to go back and forth with two different waiters. Two of my party members, including one of the pregnant mom's had to go back behind the bar to talk to the manager. At one moment a posse of wanna be gangsta's stood up from the bar behind us and asked the waiters \"Were they good?\" like we had been threatening the waiters or something! I promise you we never threatened them or suggested that we would, we were there to celebrate a special beginning we just wanted to eat! That was really offensive! Never have I experienced a situation as such in a place where I've come to spend money! When my wife's food came out it was half the size of a plate everyone else received, meanwhile 4 others had finished their plates and I and 3 more guests were still waiting to get a plate. After spending 30 minutes arguing with the waiters about the plate they still refused to comp my wife for the kids size plate they gave her and wanted to charge almost $20 for... they literally gave her half the amount of food everyone else had. I and the others still don't have a plate at this point. Once they finally bring out the other food (We asked for to go plates because after sitting there for 2 hours and arguing with waiters it was time to GO!) some staff member decides they'll give us a 10% discount. This was honestly the most stressful restaurant experience I've ever had and I cannot allow myself to go back to have to go through that again. I just CANNOT! Avoid dining in, don't take a date here, just don't eat in, PERIOD!!",

I called ahead one time came in and still had to wait for my food when I arrived at the restaurant. When you walk in to order take out you have to order at the bar. You may sit at the bar for a while before someone takes your order. I've had curry shrimp, curry snapper and escovitch fish. The meals come with rice and two sides a lot of food. Beware because the fish doesn't have a price until the chef is done making it I asked the server do you know how much and she said idk it's based on the size of the fish, which always end up being over $20.",

The rice had the perfect texture mixed with the gravy Oh My. Let's not not forget about the mac salad. All in all this was a good lunch time meal. I will be returning.",

I ordered jerk chicken with mac & cheese, and cabbage, 3 chicken patties, and 3 drinks (mamas tea and sorrell). They were out of chicken patties so got veggie. We waited awhile but I talked with the staff while I waited.  Got the food and I have to be honest I didn't get a picture but I crushed that food. I usually do white meat but they no longer serve it so had to do thighs. The jerk chicken tasted very good and had tons of sauce. The mac and cheese was okay and cabbage really good. The veggie patties were good, although I miss getting the chicken patties. The drinks were great. I love their juices, they are a must try. I will be back to the restaurant. The staff was friendly. Good portions of foods. The food was tasty. I really enjoyed eating there.",

He got the jerk chicken with Mac and cheese and collards, I got the goat curry with Mac and cheese and collards. And they gave mommas a free mimosa!! I had never had goat and I was super impressed. Our food was out quickly and tasted great. I can't wait to come back and although it was a bit pricey it was worth it. We went right home and went to sleep! Great restaurant. Great customer service. And the red fish reggae was super lively and we loved their audio! Only complaint is having to park across the street at the CVS. We were nervous about being towed!",

    "text": "Went here this past weekend with a large group of friends. First, I want to start by saying the food was excellent! Some of the best Caribbean food I've had in a long while...hands down! Which is why the absolutely HORRIBLE service myself and the other members of my group received makes it so difficult to give this establishment 2 stars...but if was just that HORRIBLE! Not only did it take several hours for our entire order to come out (despite it coming out 2 at a time), many of the orders were incorrect. I ordered the curry shrimp (Delicious!) however the portion of sides I received compared to literally EVERY other plate I saw was like half...looked like a child's plate! When I asked my server to rectify the situation she shook her head as if she understood where I was coming from and would fix it...she didn't....the rest of my food never came out...I then asked my waitress to just fix the rest of my plate to-go...again she shook her head and said ok.When another waitress came to our table with my order to-go I was happy thinking they finally were making my issue right, I was even further disappointed for this same woman to return my now bagged to-go plate and demand that I give my plate to another member of my table as she said it was his plate! It wasn't even what he ordered! The woman began to loudly argue with me in front of a restaurant full of patrons! I was in total disbelief! Completely unacceptable and extremely sad being a woman of color and being so disrespected by another woman of color inside of a black owned business! Our original waitress finally stepped in to resolve the issue and had to literally pull this other waitress to the back to get her to leave our table. Our originally waitress did end up giving us 15% discount to our orders, but by then the damage was done! Makes me so sad I can't recommend this establishment simply because we we're treated so badly, despite the food being some of the best in the city.",

In fact, we had to go up to the bar to ask for menus while they attended to other duties.... The restaurant was not that busy.   When the waitresses come to the table, she started by listing of all the items that they did not have available at the time. No word of a lie, they had four entrees left on the menu.... Only for us to place our order and then for the waitress to come back 10 minutes later to tell us there was only enough to make one of our orders.    At this point, we asked for the bill (we had ordered drinks with our entrees) paid and left. Whack! Other things to do on a Saturday night and then sit, be ignored, and waste time.  PS the fork given to us had dried rice in it and the napkins placed on our table were dirty. Yuck.",

    "text": "I was in the mood for some good jerk chicken and stumbled upon this hole in the wall Caribbean restaurant on Central Ave with a friend.  I ended getting the small jerk chicken plate with rice, peas, Mac n Cheese, and collard greens for $9.  The server warned me that the jerk chicken was spicy and I told her that was fine. She then took it upon herself to come back again and make sure that i was okay with the heat.. I told her yes once again.. she didn't bother my friend about spiciness.. so the consensus was that it was because I was white.  Atmosphere: It was rather dreary and there were more flies in the restaurant than there were people.  It only took 10 minutes before our plates came out and the server looked at me and said \"have fun..\"  The jerk chicken was spicy, but in the best possible way! It was moist and fall off the bone perfect. My friend loved it too, but he was the one that was struggling with the heat; he ended up eating it in intervals. The rice, peas, and collard greens were bland. The Mac n Cheese was alright, it tasted a bit old.  3/5 because the jerk chicken was good enough to endure some underlying racism.",

Then the lights went out. 20 minutes later she came back and asked me why I ordered what I ordered because the cooks don't prepare it that way. PEOPLE??? I ordered a freaking small curry chicken! That's all.. with plantains. Nothing extraordinary! We just told them thank you for their assistance and left. We were not about to wait another 30 minutes for our food. This was ridiculous and so unprofessional. Sad! This was at 2:15pm on a Saturday. When we arrived there were only maybe 10 people in there!

However, their jerk chicken was spicy and tender.  They messed up on one of my sides, gave me yams instead of cabbage...so be sure to check your food before you leave if you get it to go.  I will be back for those patties though, they are addictive!    I am giving them one star because I actually came back for the those beef patties on Sunday and they were not even open on time (I came early on a Sunday at 12pm and waited an hour)...now that's TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!",
