Pho An Hoa is actually right next door to another very popular Vietnamese restaurant but the hubby and I chose to go here instead because it's new to the area, and there were several Vietnamese families in there so in all honesty that right there sold me. Who would know better about a Vietnamese restaurant then Vietnamese people?! The service was great, never had an empty cup and had everything I needed without having to ask for it. I got a bowl of Pho, made mostly of beef and it was delicious and to date has been the best I've had. It was very flavorful and had all of the fixings. The prices are perfect, it's not overpriced and it would be perfect for someone on a budget. This will be my new Pho spot and I recommend it to anyone else who enjoys Vietnamese food! Cheers!",

However, it was after leaving the restaurant and carefully looking at my bill when I was incredibly disappointed with my visit.  Sure, it was probably my fault for not spotting the discrepancy, but I am usually trusting the establishment I'm paying money to wouldn't exploit my patronage to gain an extra buck or two unearned.    I am not from the Charlotte area so I understand Mecklenburg County may have some different taxing rates.  But based on my bill (a photo of which has been uploaded), the restaurant charged me 12% of my total bill for tax.  I'm pretty sure this tax rate is not used ANYWHERE in North Carolina as I also have over 10 years of experience in the service industry.  I'm also not one to quibble over a couple of dollars, but with the big picture and assuming they might engage in this overtaxing practice regularly, your average customer is being completely ripped off.  Maybe it was completely arbitrary but whatever the case, I generally have a standard to not go someplace that not only is untrustworthy, but seems to not care whether or not they have won me over as a customer by blatantly cheating on my bill.  Bottom line: check your bill carefully!  Or better yet, just go to Truc on Tryon Road where the service and food are both better.",

If i were to review them 14 years ago, I would have probably given them 2 stars for sanitation. I was just there for dinner tonight, I checked their sanitation score which is 93, it's acceptable for an ethnic vietnamese restaurant that used to be a hole in the wall place.   They put up curtains, put covers on the chopsticks and included a variety of sauces on each table. The only thing I have to warn you about is they only have one person running the kitchen and one server only...so if there are a lot of people in the restaurant(dinner time), things gets slow and hectic.   We wanted bubble teas but were told they can't make them...ok. Ordered the papaya salad, it was ok for $6, tasted kinda like pad thai but green ripe papaya instead of noodle.  Ordered #15 egg noodle with wonton, shrimp and pork. The broth was a tad salty, but overall pretty good for $8.50, the XL side. I would recommend a medium if you are moderately hungry and only and XL if you are DYING for food.  The price here is probably the best for pho, you can get a children's pho bowl for $5, then small for 7.50, medium 8.00, extralarge is 8.50. I think their best items are their noodle soup bowls. What is great about this place is that they do not charge extra for egg noodles, they have a whole category of noodle bowls that let you choose the noodle you want.",

The broth was not to my liking as it had a very strong anise flavor and lacked the rich beef flavor that I prefer.   If a friend suggested we go here, I'd unfriend them in real life. I just...can't. I can't.",

Ordered some fresh summer rolls to go and to be honest they were disappointing compared to other rolls I have had from other Vietnamese places here and Charlotte and elsewhere. The pork was tasteless, there were not many vegetables/herbs and the shrimp was rubbery. Perhaps the quality of ingredients explains why they charge significantly less than other places for the same product. I'll pass and head up the street to another establishment. Might go back to try their pho.",

Like most of these authentic Vietnamese restaurants, service gets straight to the point, I wouldn't strike up a conversation with my server or anything like that. They're really friendly and extremely fast. I stick to my regular items, as follows:  Combination pho: In my opinion, they have the best broth in Charlotte. Decent portion of meat in your pho. They add \"nuoc beo\" (fat water) to the broth, which gives it more flavor.  Bun bo hue: On a scale of 1 to 10 for spiciness, I'd say it's a 5. Broth is super flavorful, and again, decent portion of meat.  Papaya salad: OMG, soooooo good. It's a little spicy. It comes with super delicious Asian beef jerky. My mouth is watering jus thinking about it.  Avocado smoothie: Also amazing. It's thick, rich and creamy. They must use at least half of a real avocado to give it that rich texture. Good level of sweetness in my opinion, standard for more Asian smoothies/boba teas, maybe a tad less sweet than that. They give it to you in a to go cup too, so if you're too full from the pho, you can just take it with you.",

The second time I went, we went closer to closing.  I ordered the same thing in a medium bowl and there was barely any noodles in my bowl.  I took two bites and I was done.  My mom ordered a medium pho dac biet and she received a large serving of noodles but all the herbs were brown and wilted.  She pointed it out to our waitress who was rude back saying \"that's the prettiest one you are going to get\" and walks away.  Her pho was also ok not great.

    "text": "We use to come here.. it was lunch time and the place wasn't even packed. It used to be so busy. What happened to this place? Vermicelli sauce wasn't salty, spicy, our sour. It was just sweet. Had to add more fish sauce. Pho wasn't up to the hype anymore.  I ordered this pink drink on the menu and the waiter didn't even know the name of it. He just said it had coconut milk in it. He gives me a WHITE drink with coconut flavor and green jelly. Jelly was good... but I could taste the fat from the coconut. I assumed it was powdered mix of coconut so I said I didn't want the drink anymore.   Basically it wasn't what the picture presented. How can you advertise something that you can't recreate clearly? The waiter was just like \"oh okay. hold on. leme me go ask\" with no look of concern. The larger man which i assume is the boss?? Didn't even introduce himself, asks, what the problem is? We tell him that this wasn't what we expected comparing it to the menu... we can taste the coconut powder because there was LUMPS in the drink.   He interrupts me to tell me everything they make here is fresh and they don't use coconut powder in the drink. Okay... good for you but there's lumps in the drink. I don't care if you do or don't use powder... there is chalky white stuff in the drink. Every Asian knows how a good coconut dessert drink should have and not have. Regardless if you use powder... mix it enough so it can dissolve. If its the milk or cream... make sure you mix it or don't get the top part of it. It's the coconut fat. I mean how do I describe this to a boss who clearly was having a bad day already. He offered us a new drink and I just don't want it. So he says okay thats fine. Turns around and just throws it away. Like DAMN. Listen a customer and check the damn drink. LOOK at IT. I wasn't lying. This type of drink shouldn't have particles of coconut floating around.  Also, we had the Boba smoothie it was good BUT the boba was SO HARD. How can you say you make everything fresh but serve us hard boba? Yes you might make it fresh (cook to order) but are the ingredients fresh? I'm more mad about the attitude of the man. He was quite rude and he seem to rush us to pay. He didn't come back to say sorry he was just mad.  And yes, I did tip 20%. But that's only because of the total of the bill. The service was very passive and the man did not show empathy.   Will not be returning. Go to Saigon Bay or Saigon Palace. Good food, nice people.",

    "text": "UPDATE:  Every time I come back to Charlotte to visit friends and family, I take the extra initiative to go here -- it's practically a tradition.  I've already raved about their Green Papaya salad, which is as refreshing and cool as it is sweet and spicy.  But after living in NYC for a year, it's never been more apparent to me that still, the best pho I've ever had is in this old restaurant tucked away in a tiny Central Ave strip mall that hasn't changed for years.  Right up there with pulled pork, Bojangles', and my parents' home cooking, this is one of the foods that reminds me of growing up in North Carolina.    Definitely do yourself a favor and get the Pho Dac Biet-- special combination pho, with all the cuts of beef available.  XL Size, since it's only a dollar more expensive ($9.50) and double the size of the Medium.  The pho comes out relatively quickly (typically in under 10 mins!) and smells absolutely amazing.  There's a nice sweet aroma that comes out from the piping hot broth that is stronger than any other bowl of pho I've ever had.  The fragrance invites you in to take a sip of the broth before anything else.  It's good on its own, but you can always tune it to your liking with the lime, basil, fish sauce, Sriracha, and other condiments.    The noodles are great too -- standard rice noodles, not too thick, nice and chewy, and sink into your teeth before they snap.  And of course, you can't forget about all the beef, which is pretty raw when they bring it out so you can let it cook to your liking.  They give you a good amount of tripe and tendon as well, which I'm a huge fan of.  The pho here warms my soul as much as it warms my stomach.  I honestly cannot wait to go back during the holidays to down another big bowl of this -- it truly has become a Charlotte staple for me.",

We looked up the closest one and this came up with four stars! So we drove literally three minutes down the street. When we first walked in, it looked like most pho restaurant and had about four tables already sat. After we ordered we were looking around and I noticed how DIRTY it was. We sat next to a wooden block (a support beam?) and it was covered in splashed food. The condiments on the table were also caked in fingerprints. Ew. We wanted to leave but since we already ordered we stayed. After we got the food I went to check in on Yelp. The sanitation score is horrible!!! Below 90... what had we gotten ourselves into?!   The Pho was alright, not the worst. But definitely not the best I have had. The broth is way darker than other restaurants as well, and a little thicker.   I will definitely NOT be coming back.   P.S. He picked this place and did not look at the sanitation score before we sat... we would not have stayed if we have known the score!",

If you don't like pho or any Vietnamese food, you shouldn't write a review on it. I've been coming here almost 20 years and it hasn't changed. Same delicious broth, same sweet mango bubble tea, same savory fried spring rolls. My teens have been coming here with me since they were old enough to eat solids. The service can be hit or miss. If Tena is working, you're taken care of. If she's off, you may or may not get a refill - depends on which gentleman is there. But don't let that deter you - the food is worth it.",

Located off of Central, next to Cedar Land... in a very unassuming strip mall, this place is the definite go-to for Pho or Vietnamese cuisine.  It was definitely cold and starting to rain, so I went straight up Pho (#4) EXTRA LARGE.  It was a little intimidating ordering that size and we found it funny the sizes went:  CHILD, SMALL, MEDIUM, EXTRA LARGE!  Even got a bite of their spring roll, which was amazing.  My friends ordered some shakes as well, that looked quite good (since they disappeared so quickly after arriving at the table).  The staff... made you feel like a guest in their home.  Super friendly service and great tips on ordering if you are unsure.  We were having so much fun we over-stayed!  On Sundays they close at 9pm and we were still having such a good time past it, but they never said anything and made sure we were taken care of.   It was only after we saw someone putting the chair up on the tables that we realized what time it was.  Our bad!",

    "text": "I'll just go ahead and sum up what you need know here: the pho comes in so many different sizes, including child's and extra large. I'll wait while you all start to slow clap.   We put Christi K and Adam R in charge of picking us a place to eat after our kickoff event for our Yelp's Fit Club series. Since mother nature apparently didn't realize it was the first day of Spring, it was chilly and perfect pho weather.   This place is one of those amazing strip mall gems in Charlotte. It's right by another another QC SMG, Cedar Land. It's not fancy at all, but the food is delicious and the staff so friendly. Such a warm and welcoming vibe.   I wanted to soup and vermicelli, so I decided on wonton soup and a grilled pork, shrimp, and fried roll vermicelli bowl. The broth on the soup was delicious. My noodle bowl, huge and delicious. I had enough to make two meals out of it. Christi and Rose both got child size phos. I laughed when they ordered them, but they really were the perfect size for the ladies. The boys decided to be boys and get extra larges. Holy. I could probably have drowned in one of those. The avocado boba was really good. Rose loved her taro bubble . I didn't get to try it, but it sure was pretty and purple-y. It's on my list to try next time. I was cold, so I went with just a pot of regular ole hot tea.   Tonya P has already decided that we need to go here for a late breakfast and get child size phos. Okay, twist my arm. I'm in!",

    "text": "Best taro bubble tea I've had in forever, possibly in my life! That's how I started my meal at Pho An Hoa this past week with the most bubbly and fun group of Charlotte Yelper's! I couldn't help loving this group of people and the restaurant. A hole in the wall to be sure but with an incredible broth in their pho! I started with an order of fresh shrimp and pork spring rolls which was A-OK. Definitely tasty and nothing to ding them on, but not the most flavorful or protein forward that I've tried. The taro bubble tea was a different story! The bubbles were perfect, not squashy and fleshy from sitting too long but with great texture and honey-flavor. If you've never tried taro, do it! It's an Asian root that is the most Easter shade of purple imaginable.   A cold and rainy evening screams pho, so I went with the #1 (deemed the 'most popular' on the menu). Tribe, rare flank, meatballs and fatty brisket all served in a bed of noodles and incredible beef broth. Throw in some bean sprouts, basil leaves, lime and jalapeno with your choice of table sauces and you are in for a treat. Next time I will go with the non-most popular pho: number 4 or 5 would be my future pick. I gave tripe another try, but alas I don't like to crunch into my meat. I also wasn't a fan of the super fatty pieces of meat. Aside from these facts, the child's portion was perfect paired with a drink and overall a great value! Can't wait to return and try some other items from the menu; I could see Pho An Hao becoming a regular spot! Great food and awesome service all around.",

Trust the Asians, go where they go. Lang Van is chock full of white folk, and oddly enough their pho isn't nearly as good as Pho An Hoa. I always go with the classic: Pho Dac Biet. The broth here is so, so good. Not too sweet, not too salty. But seriously, the broth is where it's at.  Side note: if you're meeting someone make sure you specify the \"An\" part of the name.

Nothing. And I'm glad that it hasn't. My experience here has always been stellar. What do I get now? Oh you know, the same. However, I ask for a few more side dishes to go along with my Pho. So you want to know that inside secret don't you? I see that my review actually went long lengths for this restaurant and I'll let you readers know what's good.  So what does it for me was something one of my Vietnamese friends told me to do. He said that you had to get some sliced onions mixed with red vinegar, then together that and meat with some noodles and eat it all at once. My mouth is literally salivating for it right now. Hey, you don't have to do what I say, but I'm just letting you know, it's pretty awesome. To me, it brings the flavor out in the combination between the meat, noodles, broth, and some mixture of the dipping sauce you use with the meat. If you want to know my combination, well you'll just have to keep reading!  Overall, Pho An Hoa keeps delivering for my family and I. And I don't plan to quit on going anytime soon. This place has probably been the most stable for me and my pho cravings and will continue until further notice.",
