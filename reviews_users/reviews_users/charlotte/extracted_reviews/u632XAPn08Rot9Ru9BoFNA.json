Good draft beer selection with several locals. Would recommend.",

The only negative is that there's simply too much food on those plates!  After the green tomatoes, I could barely make a dent in my meal and had to take it home.  The sweet tea was delicious, the server was totally on point and the inside is that ubiquitous light grey color complete with televisions all around and a full bar.  They serve weekend brunch that looks both tasty and reasonably priced so I'll be back on Sunday to give that a try  :-)",

Probably one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had. The fries were hand cut and delicious. All of that for only 8 bucks.  I hope this place survives, cause it's easy to miss and they weren't very busy for a Saturday night. They're working on opening a patio, so I'll definitely be back to check that out.",

    "text": "Highly recommended. It truly is a premium sports bar. Old Pineville has been open about two months now and this was the first time we'd been by. We should have come sooner - food to price ratio is a winner. Service can't be beat either. Come football season this will be the spot.   To start, we had the boom boom shrimp appetizer and it was excellent. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, the batter/breading was crunchy, and the sauce was on point. I have to emphasize how well the shrimp was cooked because a lot of folks overcook their shrimp (and you can tell the difference when their done right). We also split some wings and a salad. The wings were great, super crispy and not fatty. We tried the sweet chili, the barbalo, and the bourbon barbecue. The barbalo was our favorite of those. The salad we had was the Orchard Salad (grilled chicken, matchstick apples, dried cranberries, candied walnuts, and goat cheese over mixed greens). The salad was awesome, but maybe too generous with the high-end toppings. We drank good beers and the prices beat most places. The prices overall were very good.   If you're in the neighborhood, you should be a regular.",

We found this place on the map and decided to give it a try and what a hidden gem! This is a neighborhood pub that I would never have even known it existed it's tucked into the end of a tiny shopping road off old pineville rd. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was only one lady on to take care of the bar and the tables and a man that greeted people at the door. We beat the rush and at first this was going to be a quiet place but as were soon proven otherwise about 8 tables all walked in right at 1230 but she handled it like a pro and you really couldn't tell she was the only person on!  The food was amazing and they make everything in house which you could really taste. Their menu had something for everyone too which was great he got his chicken and waffles and I got my tacos! They were both outstanding I was lucky to get a bite of his to try and the chicken was delicious perfectly seasoned and crispy. I think the only thing I would have changed was the fish they use for the tacos they use Swai (hope I'm spelling that right) but I'm a stickler for something with more density to it as the swai was too soft, mahi mahi is my fave so I'm biased.   All in all it was a great spot and I can't wait to go back to ty something else on the menu they seem to have it all!",

If you get a sandwich, make sure you get the homemade chips. They are delicious and it's not often a side dish at a place is such a tasty part of the meal.

    "text": "I am with Jeff on this one - glad to see a new restaurant in an area that desperately needs new restaurants - but 5 stars?  Not from what I had, perhaps I picked the wrong dishes.  We were seated at a booth in the window in perhaps the most uncomfortable booth ever.  I am 5'9 and felt like I was sitting in a hole.  But it's a new restaurant!  With great reviews!  So we're going to keep going.  An order of fried green tomatoes was going to be split as an appetizer with my dining partner.  There were three thin, tough tomatoes that were fried in a decently seasoned coating served with goat cheese that was very creamy/good and a sauce that was liberally applied that overwhelmed every other flavor.  This is not a dish that I would order again based on personal preferences, but it was well plated/presented and if you like a kick, these would be for you.    My meal order was just an appetizer of chicken skewers.  Mediterranean spices on the chicken that was juicy and well prepared, but an oily sauce that went along with it just made a mess and didn't add anything to the flavor.    My friends' Mediterranean salad was huge with fresh ingredients, so their salads look like winners.    The price was reasonable, the service was fine.  The sliders looked good - or at least seemed to be good based on the gentleman at the table next to us that was swallowing them whole.   I will definitely go back and try a burger - those being delivered around us looked like a better choice than my selections. With better choices on my part, I may come back with a higher review.",

    "text": "I wish my first experience here wasn't breakfast.  I wanted to try this place after all good reviews, and I just happened to be driving by running errands and saw their breakfast sign.  It was around 9:30am on a Saturday, and I was the only person in the place.  That always makes me wonder?!  Strip mall needs a little cleanup, but the inside is very clean, comfortable, and open with both booths and tables in addition to the bar area with multiple large screens and an outdoor patio on front of building.    I was only going to drop by quickly to grab the $4.99 2-egg, sausage, toast, potatoes and coffee special.  But after looking at the menu, I'm always a sucker for an Eggs Benedict.  The waitress was new here for a week and seemed new to waitressing in general.  No problem as we all need to learn.  However, when she asked me how I wanted my eggs for Eggs Benedict, I was surprised and worried.  I said poached and not runny.  No such luck.  The eggs were completely liquid and ran all over my plate.  The bread was thick and completely entrenched in butter, and my very thin and burnt slice of some type of meat was very inedible.  But no, not the Hollandaise miss?!  Yes, I hate to say, the Hollandaise was more of a cheesy mixture.  Sigh...  As sometimes happens when the waitress notices you completely are not enjoying your meal, she avoided me like the plague.   With now only two diners in the place, she finally came to only ask if I was ready for the bill. Hmm...I think I'll give it some time and try again but only for lunch or dinner.",

It was a Friday night and I was so worried it would be super busy, but to our surprise it was only about halfway filled and we got seated immediately. Some of the items I saw in Yelp photos were not on the menu, like the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers (sigh) but there were plenty of other delicious options. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was one of the best ones I had ever had! It was obviously hand breaded and cooked to perfection. They make their own dressings and the blue cheese dressing was to die for!!!!! I smothered my chicken sandwich in it. So good! My husband got a burger and thought it was perfectly cooked and delicious. Very decent prices, a full bar and lots of sports on the multiple TVs. Good for kids too! So sad we live 2 hours away!!",

But then our waitress was busy chatting with other employees behind the bar. There were about five employees that I could see and there were only five patrons. Someone did come around and asked how everything was-and the wings were tasty. But we waited a long time for the bill and it was not our server who got it for us. Then we put the card with the bill and waited about 6/7 minutes- watching the employees talk about yoga and their body types for that time, hoping they would glance over and come get our check so we could go. After waiting I got up and took it to the bar where no customers but several employees were. The woman behind the bar became upset that I brought the check over. I waited and was watching a game above the bar and then watched her walk away from me over across the restaurant to our table and set it down. Wow! SHE REALLY SHOWED ME! Definitely a normally relaxing place to get high quality wings and things. But this interaction took the place down a lot. Hopefully the management can work with their staff to train them how to do their job.",

    "text": "Found out about this place quite by accident when my wife and I decided to checkout the Three Spirits Brewery.  One of the servers handed us the menu and told us they had just opened and were delivering although they were located just around the corner.  Not sure if that service will continue, but it's a nice touch.  After getting past the name of this place, which I think should be reconsidered, i perused their menu. Simply put, their food choices rock.  They have burgers, sandwhiches, comfort food sides, and some awesome appetizers.  Even more impressive is their prices which are ridiculously inexpensinve.  In point of fact, I think they are a little to inexpensive. They'll likely have to go up a bit once they get their costs worked out.    We had already prepared our slow cooker dinner at home, so we decided to use this as an opportunity to get their appetizers and sides.  I was not disappointed. Their Redneck Eggrolls were simply divine: I could have eaten that as my main dish. But, it was their black and Bleu house chips that really took the cake.  I have never had house chips anywhere-ever that were perfectly made and so crispy you could chew on them for a whole minute and still be crunching away when it was time swallow.  Wow.  I can not emphasize enough how good those chips were.  Amazing.  So, we did not have a main dish, but I know we'll be checking out their digs the next time we head that way.  Kudos until me meet again!",

    "text": "I hate to be the party pooper of all these 5 star reviews but I don't see what is so special here.  I've been driving by this space for a while. I've seen restaurants come and go from this spot and while I am happy to see a restaurant finally open beyond 3pm in this space, I still think they have some flaws to work out.  The place is a sports bar. There are TVs on every wall. There's booth, table, bar and pub table seating. There's 2 tables outside the entrance for the outdoor feel. It's located in a small strip mall on Old Pineville Road that you would probably blink and miss as you drove by.  First off, I was hoping for some local draft beer options but they only had 2 selections of OMB and a Dales Pale ale which is sort of NC. The rest were Goose Island (owned by Anheuser Busch), Angry Orchard Cider, and Great Lakes and maybe one or two others. OMB is just around the corner from this place--withing walking distance!. It would be nice if they offered something you couldn't get on this side of town....NoDa, Birdsong, D9?  The menu is broad with mostly pub food and handful of entrees. They have a large selection of wings flavors and offer 3 flavors of grilled wings.   My friend and I started out with chips and queso as an appetizer. It was ok but again it was bar food.  We both order wings. She ordered Firecracker and I ordered Firecracker and Stinger hoping one of them would be spicy. While the chicken was great, neither flavor was spicy and we couldn't even tell them apart. There seemed to be a slightly sweet sauce with one or two chili flake flavor to the sauce. The other sauce was unnoticeable from the other. The ranch dressing that we did not order was actually good. Blue cheese was just ok and there were only 6 small pieces of celery.  While the staff was great and very appreciative of us stopping in, I think this is far from a 5-star place.  If you're looking for a neighborhood pub then this is a great place. But the one problem is it's not in any real neighborhood. The only things in walking distance are other businesses and a few hotels.    Still, I hope they do well here because as I've said, I've seen so many restaurants come and go in this space.",

    "text": "Yelp you have seriously let me down.  Hoping for some solid grub close to our hotel, we chose this pub based on Yelp reviews...complete fail.  The server was sweet and the Yuengling on tap cold and fresh, but all was downhill after that.  Queso dip was flat and boring, fried jalapenos were the only flavor in it, and served with tortilla chips that tasted 1000 years old...completely stale and soft.  My BLT on sourdough was nice, but served with 1000 year old \"chips\"...completely stale and zero flavoring.  Hubby's pulled pork Sammy was nice and the coleslaw fresh and with a nice vinegary bite, the brioche bun was fresh and tasty too.  But served with the same sad, stale potato chips, WTH??? Sad waste of $50 and a night in Charlotte.",

I took the top off and saw a black thing on the lettuce also. I then took it off, looked at my sandwich( which was SUPPOSED to be a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich) it was really a piece of soggy fried chicken, no buffalo sauce. The fires where gross. My boyfriend ordered their Carolina Burger, which was supposed to come with Chili, pickles, onion and slaw. It came with a barley drop of chili, and four baby onions. This was a terrible lunch",

But we're here, and we're hungry, so we decided to give it a shot.  No complaints at all about the service.  Heather was very friendly and answered all of our questions and took great care of us.  The owner also came by to check on us.  The food was a mix. I agree with the statement of the menu being more pub like, but the salad I had was huge, the lettuce fresh, the salad dressing homemade (but a little watery) with great croutons.  I had the boom boom shrimp which also tasted very fresh and was quite tasty.  My wife had the nachos, and I was a little disappointed in those, chips did not seem to be the freshest to me, and the queso was just okay.  In summary, it's worth a shot if you're looking for a good, slightly out of the way pub experience.",

The delivery man - who I can also guess owns? the Pub was interested in doing an event with my neighborhood.  I heard the food was delicious.  The second encounter was for our neighborhood social/brunch.  We had a table of 20-or so outside and although the service was a bit off (which I can't blame them), the food was great and they were super nice.  The third encounter was a quick late night dinner - my first time actually inside.  The pub has tons of TVs - a great place to catch up on sports, and great daily specials!  Appetizers are half off from 4-6 Monday through Friday.  We ordered tacos and buffalo chicken sliders - both were great.",

Of course,  no guarantees  that will continue  with free delivery or dlivery at all in the future but they are close enough to grab a bite on the way home.  We ordered the black and Bleu house chips and redneck egg rolls. Both were absolutely delicious! The house chips were the best I ever had, crispy every bite to  the end. It was great that they paired with another local business to help promote their opening. Smart choice.  Not too keen on the name of this place. The owners could have been a bit more creative. However, we will definitely be back for more. They have so many other delicious choices.",

This place was great!  Super nice waitress and very engaged and polite owner/operator. They were both very friendly and added to our visit. They were neither absent not too present at our table.  Just right.   Hubby had the wings with bourbon BBQ sauce and he raved about them. Said the sauce was excellent.  I had the chicken Cobb salad and it was delicious. The chicken was marinated in something really tasty. Overall it was terrific. Both entrees were priced low in our opinion.   Tried two different beers on tap we were not familiar with and really liked them.   A great way to end our long day traveling to our special event!  I added photos of our entrees.",

Stopped by after a Panthers game and was pleased to see they had the afternoon games on. Ordered some tasty beverages upon sitting down and went in for some wings! I don't typically order the wings but glad I did this day. Fresh and Crispy! Important to know is that the dressings are homemade. I was craving a burger so went with the Light Rail w/ the pimento cheese and it had house chips as a side. You guessed it- I used homemade ranch to dip the chips in. Such a large menu but I honestly do no think you can go wrong here. The friendly waitress  was very attentive. ( they were short staffed by the way). She also made some recommendations of what some folks tend to order if you need help with the large menu. Noticed they have drink specials as well. Panthers got the win this day and so did Old Pineville Premium Pub.",

The tomato cucumber salad and sun-dried tomato sauce that the chicken skewers came with were pretty good, but the chicken itself wasn't special.   The drinks were cheap and we were there on a Wednesday when everything on tap was $1 off.   They have tons of TVs all around, so this is a great place to come watch any sporting event.   The one disappointing thing was that the service wasn't that great. It often took a while for someone new to get served and to get refills.   All in all, I think this is an underrated bar with surprisingly good food. I would come back and try a burger next time.",

I agree it doesn't really qualify as a neighborhood pub; however, folks were hanging with their friends, making new ones, while a trio of 60+ year olds flirted with the bartender (like they stood a chance).  McCoy's is 100 yards away and they manage the same flux of hungry souls, too, so apparently not a big deal.   I ordered the Cialis Burger because I wanted a juicy hunk of meat with an egg running all over my plate  (and not because I need help getting it up.  Hey, that's what it says on the menu--just need to vanquish any doubts!).  Both the burger and egg were cooked perfectly.  I added salt, however.  The shoestring fries were a surprise.  Gone.  Overall, a do-over and another place to take Lori on a Saturday.  Give 'em whirl!",

I came here for just a couple of beers and to hang out with a friend that was visiting in town and since we were both there we picked this place out of the magic of Yelp and well just a bar that was open.   What we received in return was friendly service, good beers, and all of it pretty decently priced. They accommodated us wherever we decided to sit and the overall experience was pretty good. One thing to keep in mind however is that sitting outside can be loud with all the traffic noise. I would recommend to sit inside if there's space, but hey, if it's packed and it's the only place you can sit...there's TVs outside for your viewing pleasure. I definitely recommend to check out this spot and if I ever come across this place again I'll have to eye that menu.",

We were lucky they tolerated us being there for over four hours, as there was a lot of catching up to do!   I would say that this is a pub first and a restaurant second.   The bar area and selection of beers looked phenomenal.  It strikes me as funny that there were many patrons sipping on their beers and cocktails so early in the day, but who am I to judge?  I ordered grilled chicken strips that came with stewed green beans,  rice, mac and cheese, onions, and peppers. It had a brown gravy over it. It was a lunch special for Monday.  While it was nothing to write home about, it definitely was priced right and it more than filled me up.   I found the mac and cheese to have a funny taste, the green beans were delicious, and the chicken was average.     Great atmosphere overall with music that was not blaring.  I am definitely glad that I tried this out. It seemed like a locally owned place (not sure about this) and I do like to support the mom and pop type places.   In the four hours that I was there, I probably got my money's worth on iced tea refills.   That means I had way too much caffeine and will be up way too late tonight - prancing back and forth to the bathroom.  Not every day do i get four hours talking with Tom, so the bathroom thing will be marked up as small potatoes.",

The space is so welcoming and cozy. I feel like it's a small town bar which you don't find often in bigger cities. There are tons of tvs so plenty of viewing spots for games! It's definitely on the smaller side but it adds to the homey feel!   The food was impressive for what you would expect at a pub! A lot of homemade, delicious food! We started with the queso (homemade) and it was sooooo cheesy, I mean you can never go wrong with cheese! I got the chicken salad sandwich (homemade, again) and my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken salad was awesome, and I'm a stickler for chicken salad, it has to be really good for me to enjoy it and this one was so worth it! The buffalo chicken was amazing too! And another meal I'm used to getting when out, and this was by far one of the best I've tried! The buffalo sauce was perfect, had the smallest amount of kick so that you could really enjoy the buffalo taste without burning up!   Cocktails were good too. Nice wine pour and the drinks were nice and strong! AND they have tonsssss of drink specials throughout the week. Definitely check those out!   I can't wait to come back for a game or a low key night to have some drinks and try some more of the super extensive, delicious menu!",

Doing the word puzzle with a guy at the bar, the waitress and Emily (bartender) was a perfect example of the chill nature of the place. It will be my go to anytime I'm spending the night near KCLT.",

Last night we came by to watch the Panthers game and I realized I never wrote a review!!  The many things I love about this pub.... -It's clean inside. Nicely decorated. Like it feels like a nicer pub -It is a bit of a local pub, kinda hidden. Thus, it isn't always crazy busy there. We were able to easily find bar seats to watch the game and didn't have to go there early to get them!  -Lots of seating -Great beer prices. They don't have many local taps but the prices are great. -Good pub food. The wings are good and lots of flavors. Sliders are awesome too. -Most importantly, the chill atmosphere. You can just be yourself!",

    "text": "Great hidden gem of a bar that is fortunately for me located right around the corner from my house! My wife and I stumbled upon this place by chance, but have now been back a few times on miscellaneous occasions. Our latest visit was to grab some dinner (since our fridge was bare and the thought of the grocery store seemed overwhelming) and catch the end of the Panthers season opener. What I have found you get with Old Pineville is a clean, upscale pub that serves a wide selection of good beer and a fresh and equally wide array of great pub grub.   First off, I'm impressed how clean the place is. Plenty of TV's, seating, patio space, and they also use one of the TV's to display their current beer and draft selection. Speaking of, it is an impressive list. I think they had around 15 beers on tap when I was there. For food our last visit we ended up getting some wings and burger sliders (a.k.a. football food) and sitting at the bar. All of the food came out relatively quick and was really tasty.   Another nice thing about this place is that it isn't absolutely swamped. I'm all about atmosphere for certain occasions, but I can't handle the crowds at places like All American for every Panther's game. If you want a spot where you can actually sit, watch and hear the game, and also have some side conversations with the people you came (or met at the bar), then this might be the place for you. Hope to see you there!",

Sat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers. Looked over the menu (HELLO daytime brung menu, thank you!!!) and ordered the bleu cheese chips and the wings. Both really good. I could have used more bleu cheese dressing but I made it work.   The staff was very nice. Not hovery but did a nice job keeping our glasses full. They offer a bloody mary bar at least today they did (Saturday) and they also had $3.50 mimosa. I did not see which champagne they use which can really make or break a mimosa. Take your chances and try one.   We then moved out to the patio to smoke a cigar to celebrate our win over IA State. Woohoo! Nice patio. TV's (4) and they will offer to change the channel to whatever you want to watch.   WE wish this place was in our hometown. We can't find not act is decent. Well done!!!",

I ordered the blackened shrimp salad, but subbed salmon, added cranberries and avocado with Italian dressing. Salmon was cooked perfectly! Salad was great. Had vodka and soda to go with it! No problems on this side at all.  My problems came with service. Amelia B was my bartender. I'm not sure what the problem was because she was very energetic, conversational, and attentative to (what appeared to be) regular customers at the bar. This was my first time in this establishment. She offered me NOTHING. Not even a menu. I had to ask for everything I needed and wanted. When my glass was empty, she did not offer another drink, I had to ask for it, even though, I heard her offer other people 2nd, 3rd and 4th drinks. I put money in the jukebox and tried to break the ice by asking her what kind of music she likes, that didn't work. Still no conversation from her, she went right back her regulars, as if I was not a paying customer. I ate my entire meal with no napkins. I decided against asking for any because I felt like I was a bother at this point. I even had to tell her to take my card, because it did not appear that she was going to come cash me out after she brought my check (that I had to ask for). No dessert was offered, she never asked how was my food, did I need more dressing, was my salmon cooked well enough. NOTHING. Lastly, when she dropped my card back off to me, of course,  she did not invite me back. Very poor service.  I'm not sure in what manner I was profiled, but Amelia showed no interest in taking care of me like her regular customers.",

And the burger is good enough to not be mad at but not get again. The bun could've better.   My only major gripe here is my glass wasn't clean. Not even smudginess outside the glass. It was somethin on the inside glass of my tea and I didn't even eat yet. This was while I was still waiting for the food to come out. They corrected the issue once I brought it to their attention but this was just a no no. It set the tone off wrong.   As far as the racist vibes I read on here that some got, I didn't get that. Although I was the only black guy in there. I was treated fairly by the waitress and the elderly gentleman who greeted me when I stepped in. I just wish I selected food that had more comeback value and my glass was cleaner.",

The owner came by our table as well to make sure all was good. they have a nice bar, but the wine list is somewhat lacking. I'd like to see a greater choice in better wines, but it is really sort of a neighborhood sports bar. Most patrons that night were at the bar and there are TV's all around the dining room. We started with Onion Rings and Fried Pickles. The rings were huge, crispy and hot. The pickles may be the best we have ever tried. For our \"meal\" we had the LoSo Sliders. Very good.

It was pretty cold in there, and I'm not usually one to say that, so take a sweater. The fried pickles & chicken tenders were awesome. The chicken nachos were so good, could use some more cheese dip though. Normally the fried green tomatoes are on point, but just weren't that good that night - breading falling off everywhere, lots of balsamic soaked in the breading made it pretty acidic. I always enjoy their sister restaurant, Glenway Premium Pub, and this place held up their good reputation.",

I hate to confirm what other black folks have said in the reviews of this bar but I find it to be True. This bar completely ignored my wife and I when we came in for an afternoon snack during college football season.   The restaurant was empty except for a few people who were sitting at the bar. After standing by the door waiting to be seated about 5 minutes a waitress finally addressed us. She didn't get up from her seat at the bar where she was drinking. She just turned around and said \"Seat yourselves. Anywhere you want.\"  We sat down. We sat there for 10 minutes while every employee in the business ignored us. Some even made eye contact with us via the mirror behind the bar but then they would quickly look away. No one ever brought over menus, took our drink order or even greeted us.   I am beyond disgusted. At a time when we should be unifying behind our similarities I feel that I was judged by the color of my skin. This bar has other reviews from black people who also felt un-welcomed in recent months.   I've been here before and I wasn't treated like this. I tipped well and I was very friendly. I don't know what could've changed.   We ended up leaving without being served or addressed by the waitstaff other than when they told us to seat ourselves. We were there for a total of 15 minutes before giving up on being treated with dignity. If they don't want my money I'm not going to give it to them and I'll never return to this bar again.   So I guess they get what they want. And I got what I want too, by going to their competitor McCoy Smokehouse and Saloon which was bustling on a Saturday afternoon with a lively atmosphere, friendly customer service and great value on their menu.   If you're reading this and don't want to support a business that might be racist (at worst) or has a supremely lazy staff (at best) then head over to McCoys up the street. You won't regret it and they have some of the best wings in Charlotte.",

    "text": "This is a hidden gem in Charlotte. A friend and I stopped here for dinner on whim...a whim called Yelp which recommended it!  They had great food and drink specials, and after looking at the menu I realized they have specials every day--so you're not going to break the bank getting some dinner.  I went with the tacos, which were the Tuesday deal: $5.95 for two tacos with chips and salsa. I did the grilled chicken, with chilli lime and pickled purple cabbage and the fish taco with cucumber mango salsa, basil and lime. Both were so well cooked and presented. I don't think anything was left on my plate. Ingredients were tasty and fresh.  Everything on the menu sounded good--I'm looking forward to going back.",

Everyday they have a different lunch special and I opted for the chicken strips. Soup, a drink, and the entree totaled $8.95 - very affordable. The chicken was a little dry and slightly over cooked. The rice was a little dry, but other than that, it was quite tasty.  Will return for something else next time!",

I ordered a BLT with an egg on it. That sandwich was  Hubby ordered 3 tacos they all were so good. This my 1st time trying this place I will be back again real soon.   Update: Me and my husband went here again on a Saturday and it was not a good experience at all. 1st we waited for someone to greet while we listened to a customer talk to the staff while they stared at us. Finally someone did speak to us but they were sitting down at the bar. We went to sit down and waited to be greeted by someone and it never happened. The staff acted like we were not even there. It was a mirror facing me so I could see the staff ignoring us. After not being greeted and ignored we left. No one even took the time to acknowledge that we were even there. This place is racist. Don't waste your time going here. McKoys up the street is much better and treated us like they wanted our money.",

Great specials and the place was clean. Toula was absolutely amazing, she took great care of us. Gentleman that seated us was hard at work the whole time keeping tables clean and people happy. We look forward to retrying other items on the menu",

    "text": "I recently moved to South Charlotte from Plaza and was looking for a simple bar with good food. My husband and I found OPPP and we love going there. It's a little hole in the wall with tons of specials and the staff is so friendly.   We had a cheese dip and burgers and were shocked at the price. So reasonable! For a Saturday night, the place was busy, but it wasn't like you were fighting for service like a Southend bar. There aren't a lot of good quaint spots in South Charlotte that do a burger right, and I'm so happy we found this place! Don't get me wrong, we love our southend spots, but sometimes we just want simple.  If you're looking for a place with simple, classic bar food, a nice patio, and really friendly service, head to OPPP! It's super close to the breweries off Old Pineville (OMB, Brewers at Yancey) so if you don't want to wait for food there, OPPP is super easy to get to.  Recommendations: Any burger or the fish sandwich!",

However, upon entry I was greeted by a hostess who gave me a super dirty, prejudgment, uncomfortable to assist me type look. It was one of those...\"why are you in here\" looks. I kid you not, I turned around and walked out.  I won't go as far to say that it had everything to do with me being a beautiful brown goddess, but it felt racial. The fact that the restaurant welcomed bikers, didn't cause me to shy away as I wanted to remain open and unbiased, although historically, racism has been prevalent amongst biker gangs. Why should I allow that to stop me from having a great culinary experience?   This goes to show that 1st impressions are everything. An off-putting roll of the eyes by a hostess can send business running out the front door. I hope I'm wrong, especially being that my money is green like everyone else's.",
