It kind of reminds me of Chinese places I ate at as a kid with my grandparents so for the found memories thank you Shun Lee.    The chinese food is good and what you would expect nothing fancy.  They have recently remodeled part of the restaurant and now offer sushi.  The first time I ordered it I thought it was ok but nothing great - but last nights sushi was very good.  They have a fairly large sushi menu now with some inventive options.  BIG PLUS 30% off sushi - its a promotion going on now till sometime in late November so if you want to check this place out now is a perfect time.  Another plus you can always get a seat at this place.",

    "text": "I HAVE NOT EATEN AT THE RESTAURANT- HAVE ONLY TRIED THEIR TAKEOUT/PICK-UP. Shun Lee Palace is a little pricey for my taste, for take-out Chinese; granted I am from Philly and have lived in NYC both cities where there are authentic places in suspect corners doling out good ethnic cuisine for next to nothing.  The food is decent. I am sure they use loads of MSG (the effects on my body are recognizable the next morning), and their portions are small. A few entrees, and a quart of wonton soup will run you over 40 dollars. **The sesame chicken and sweet and sour chicken dishes consistently have too much corn starch and batter, respectively. On top of that, the entree is about 20% hard batter/starch MINUS the chicken.     As far as late night in  Myers Park goes, this is the only alternative to pizza that I've found and for that alone it gets another star.",

Just went there this past Thursday to pick up some Chinese to-go and 3 hrs after eating it I had diarrhea and threw up multiple times to the point where there's nothing left in me. It is now Sunday and I still have a sour stomach with diarrhea, hopefully it will be gone by tomorrow. On a better note, atleast I only missed work on Friday and am using the rest of the weekend for rest. Will never go there again. Not sure if it was the \"chicken\" (if that's really what it is) or the eggroll that caused it, but this meal was the only one I consumed that day and definitely was the cause of the poisoning. Never Again! Stay far away!",

I immediately called at 1:35, and the lady on the phone, after initially disagreeing with me, actually read the order and agreed that my order was wrong, and that I'd be welcome to come pick up the missing portions of the order.  I let her know that I was sick in bed, and that's why I ordered delivery from here, and that I would not be getting out to fix their mistake.  She let me know that she would speak to the owner and let me know IF they could bring me the remaining portion.  She called twenty minutes later to let me know that they would bring the remaining portion of my order in 15 minutes, which means that the lunch I paid for will be cold and will have to be heated.  I worked in the service industry during college and graduate school as a waitress and bartender, and I know that easiest thing to do, especially on a slow Tuesday lunch shift, is to make sure that orders are correct.  I will not order delivery from this restaurant again.",

I was surprised that the same entree which I ordered a month or two ago had decreased in volume by about a third.  Plus, it didn't taste as good as the last time I ordered the same entree.    I was even more surprised when the price was two dollars more than the price on the take out order from my last visit.  The friendly woman at the register said that the prices had gone up.  However, when I got home and read the new photocopied take out menu, the price had gone up only twenty five cents from that which was on the menu which I had ordered from.  I think that the quality, quantity and price of Shun Lee have decreased in quality overall since the new owners took over.  I had frequented this restaurant regularly while Frank Lee owned it over the last thirty years.    I will definitely think twice about returning to eat or take out at Shun Lee Palace in the future.",

As previous reviews have mentioned the decor is circa 1970 but it gives the place some charm. They do not skimp on the portion sizes or the amount of meat in the dishes. Many other Chinese restaurants over load the veggies without much meat. The sa cha chicken and Mongolian beef could have been spicier.  Overall experience was good and we will be returning again soon.",

The place was purchased by new owners a couple of years ago and while the food is still pretty good, the service is...spotty at best.  I think they try to make due with fewer servers than they should have so once you place your order, you never see them until they drop off your food and then you are on your own again until the check comes.

Our table had the sweet and sour chicken (diner complimented the generous portion but she's a light eater), the spicy chicken and chinese eggplant (almost too spicy for our spice-loving guest and the eggplant looked a bit slimy - diner kept referring to it as the unidentified \"fish\" in the dish) and chicken chow mein (lots of lettuce and veggies in the chow mein, I should have ordered the sesame chicken).  We all ordered hot tea - hey, it was chilly today! - and the server brought a large pot to the table that lasted us the entire meal.  Prices are fair - $5-7 for lunch entrees that come with fried rice and egg roll.  But the food just isn't memorable for me.  It's merely okay if I'm in the neighborhood but not worth a trip from anywhere for me.  Lunchtime clientele seemed to be 65% retirees and 35% local business people/office workers/realtors.",

    "text": "This is my place to go when I'm in the mood for Chinese food and it's not just because it's convenient relative to where I currently live. I used to live in the University Area and would trek down to Shun Lee for special occasion dinners. This is where my now-husband and I had our first official date many years ago and where we went the night he proposed. We don't keep going for sentiment, but for the food. My favorite dish is the beef with broccoli mainly because the brown sauce they use is delicious and the broccoli is fresh. My husband enjoys their general tsos chicken, paper shrimp, wontons, and chicken with broccoli. His brothers really enjoy their hibachi dishes. If you enjoy vegetables, the hibachi dishes are a very good deal. We go there often enough that there have been a few off nights, but their off nights have been very few and far between for us. We both dine in and do take out. We do both lunch and dinner. One dish I haven't had much luck with is an appetizer, their bbq spare ribs. They're flavorless except for the oil they're cooked with. I haven't had much luck with bbq regular or boneless spare ribs in Chinese restaurants around town anyway so it's not a deal breaker by any means. The service can be hit or miss depending on which severs you have, how well they're staffed that day, and how new the staff is. Some days you may have to grab several different servers as they dash around to get what you need, but they're typically eager to please and easy to work with.",

Nothing could have prepared me for this experience as I operate on the assumption that at worse, the food at Shun Lee Palace would be edible...NOT!!  I ordered several things for me and my family to try focusing mostly on appetizers as they SHOULD be the hardest things to get wrong: two of the steamed appetizers, egg drop soup, spring rolls, crab rangoons and an entree, Sesame Chicken.  Pretty straightfoward fare that you can basically find at any Chinese spot in America, right?  Not the case at Shun Lee Palace!  The steamed pork dumplings were slightly savory although dish presentation was horrible; it made the food less appealing to the eye.  The other steamed appettizer, shrimp dumplings were odd-shapped bite-sized nuggets but they lacked any flavor...even shrimp which makes me question the contents of the translucent nuggets.  The soup also lacked flavor and the spring roll did not contain any meat just barely heated shredded cabbage and carrots.  Now to the biggest travesty of the evening:  the Sesame Chicken.  While the chicken was sliced as indicated in the menu description, it was neither crispy or flavorful.  It was simply disgusting.  The chicken which appeared to be poached was floating in a sacharrine-sweet brown sauce with sesame seeds tossed in for good measure.  There was no broccoli in the dish and the overall presentation of the dish was poorly executed.  In all candor, it did not resemble in taste or physical appearance, the very traditional dish of Sesame Chicken.  In Shun Lee Palace's defense, the night we ordered food from them was their busy night.  I assume for take out or delivery because that fact was not represented in the dining room with maybe 6 tables being served while we were in there.  I gave this place a chance but there will be no other chances.  It was easily the worst Chinese food I have ever had!",

Their food is fine, good even, but certainly nothing special.  They have a large menu, which is nice, and a large restaurant so you don't have to wait.  If you live near Shun Lee it might be the place for you because they remember their regulars and have a great family run establishment.  If you want to try something that is a little fresher, I recommend trying Baoding (Southpark), DragonFly (Park Rd/ Myers Park), or HoHo (Dilworth).",

    "text": "Hello, 1980s!  Stepping into Shun Lee Palace is like stepping back in time.  The colors of Mauve and Hunter Green abound in the decor.  And lets not forget the swivel chairs.    We went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately.  Like someone else mentioned in their review, it was mostly an \"older\" crowd.  (Perhaps they've been there since the 80s?)   It took quite some time before we were greeted by our server and quite a time longer before she returned to take our orders.    I like to think that I know my way around a Chinese restaurant, but there were dishes on the menu with which I was not familiar.  And, unfortunately, there were no descriptions.  Tai Chi?  Tung Ann?  New Tze?  Flower Chicken?  Royal Chicken?  Peacock Chicken?  I asked our server about two of them, but didn't want to ask any further and went with Sa Cha Chicken because I knew I had had it someplace once before.  The food came out as it was made.  First, two (of five) dinners were brought out, one of which had to be taken back because it was wrong.  Then that second one returned with the correct entree.  Then a third dinner came out.  And then finally, the fourth and fifth together.  The food was enjoyable, but a bit on the bland side.  If my entree has a little mark next to it because it's spicy, I want it spicy.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  And there was nothing on the table to doctor it up.  Everything tasted very fresh, though, so kudos for that.  And the kids' entrees were pretty big, so they were a good value.    I'm wary of Chinese restaurants that don't automatically offer you chopsticks.   I like chopsticks.  I like to eat Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and sushi dinners with chopsticks.  It adds to the experience.  Since we rarely saw our server, I didn't even bother to ask for a pair.  Maybe there was a shortage in the 1980s?    I'm sure some people have been going to Shun Lee Palace since they decorated in the 1980s and love it.  I, for one, have experienced much better.  Much, MUCH better.  Atmosphere is a big deal for me.  Shun Lee didn't have it, so we won't be going back.    p.s. What's up with the clothing rack in the dining room?  You might think it was for people to hang their coats; however, you'd be wrong.  Apparently it's a rack where the employees can hang their street clothes up during their shifts.  (Because I doubt that anyone took off their T-shirts at dinner because they were too hot.)  Tres tacky.",

We started with the hot and sour soup. It was lighter like I like it w/o being heavy on the soy. It was topped with lots of chopped scallions - a plus! We then moved on to Beef with Black Pepper and Kung Pao Chicken. My favorite was the beef. I think I tasted a little sherry in addition to the peppery goodness? Oh, and the server was attentive and before we left some other guy came and thanked us. It was a pleasant Sunday evening experience.",

I will never go here again. So much better when Frank owned and ran the restaurant.",

The food was not good at all!  They only serve vegetable egg rolls, nothing with meat. The service was even worse.  It took our waitress forever to wait on us (they weren't busy at all which is another bad sign) and then when we did order our drinks it took 15 minutes or longer to get them, including a bottled beer!  The manager came by our table and asked if we needed anything and we said our drinks and he said she's making them now.  You don't have a bartender?  You and your wife or someone else stand up there behind the bar doing absolutely nothing!  The food was absolutely terrible!  Next time I'll go to Baoding where I know the food is good!

I don't think they are up with the times when some people are focused on their health as some other restaurants are.  So we ended up leaving and going to The Great Wall of China where they have and did cater to or dietary needs.  Another place that has also done so is Thai Taste in Matthews.  The reason the restaurants use vegetable oil is that it's the cheapest one to use even those it's bad for you heart wise.  I don't blame them but at least if a customer request and brings their own oil use it.",

I ordered the Szechuan Eggplant, and it was really good. There was plenty on the plate, too, so I took leftovers to work today for lunch. The couple who took us there wanted the spicy green beans, and although the restaurant had sold out of green beans, the manager went to the Harris Teeter around the corner to grab some for us. Even with the little hiccup, the food was ready quick, and it was all delicious.  My only complaint is that the vegetarian selection is a little skimpy...there were 3 or 4 things on the menu, which isn't bad, but usually a Chinese restaurant will have lots of options.",

The lady wasn't very friendly and helpful in suggesting any special dish. Here are my reviews on the dishes that I did buy.   Pork Fried Rice - It was blah! There was no flavor to the rice but oil.   General Tso Chicken - It was blah too!! Barely any flavors  House Special Lo Mein - This one taste a lot better than the other two dishes, but was just okay for me too.   The only dish I did like was their Beef, Shrimp and Scallop stir fry dish, but none of the dishes really screamed that I will be visiting again next time!

Many of the patrons were seniors, next middle-aged (40s), and then a couple younger people.  We left discontent because the veggie lo mein noodles were oily and limp and the Mongolian beef was fatty.

I called to inquire, and I asked if there wasn't supposed to be crab in them. she laughed and said \"no\". guess thats just how they make them but every other place I've had them at has crab and cheese.  I may still order when I'm too lazy to leave the house and craving chines, but definitely not my first choice.",

I love their fried rice and fried chicken wings. I had a party of 17 people there yesterday to celebrate my birthday. The waiter had an awesome personality and even let me know when my 8 year old  asked for a 3rd refill on her caffeinated beverage. The manager was nice enough to work with us through an issue with confusion about their coupon policy. Most of my party was family from out of town and they said that they loved it and want to come back when they are in town. Everyone should try them out because the food is ao good.",

You no longer walk through a beaded curtain to use the restroom though, which I always thought was so cool!  The food and service is good. The prices are great. I love the Wonton soup. You can order a Wonton Soup for 2 for under $7.00. Order it to go and you have enough soup to make a couple of meals off of it. Some of my favorite entrees are the sizzling three delights and shrimp with Chinese eggplant. These portions are always large enough for my husband and I to share.   A delicious dinner for two with appetizers and wine under $30.00....tell me what is not awesome about that?  To satisfy those Chinese cravings, go check out Shun Lee Palace.",

And, yes, the restaurant has been renovated and looks much better than it did years ago, but the food was horrible.  I started with a spring roll and wonton soup. The spring roll was nothing great, but at least warm and not greasy. However, the soup, blah again. No flavor in the broth what so ever and the wonton was nasty, almost frozen like taste. I ordered the chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies for my entree. UGH! Needless to say there was a pull of grease from the brown sauce and the taste of the dish was nothing great.   I think the servers mean well, but when they bring the wrong soup, forget your drink and deliver a dirty glass I pretty much know I am done. Sorry Shun Lee, I won't be back.",

I had eaten there approximately 6 years ago prior and I remember The food being tasty.  Well, what a difference 6 years can make.  The crab rangoon was decent, the pan fried dumplings were barely fried. One of the cooks wasn't sure if the food that someone in the kitchen made ( and was part of my order) was called \"Chow mein\" or \"Chow men\". This concerned me a bit, as the it should have( because if you are working there  you should be able pronounce the menu items), because the noodles in the \"chow mess \" taste like MUSH along with the vegetables ( overcooked).   It's  not how I remember it. And I won't be going back. I only gave it an extra star due to the crab rangoon being o.k.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Chinese food so when I was visiting my sister and her fiance this past Sunday I suggested Chinese for dinner.  Off we went to Shun Lee.  Apparently this is one of their favorite Chinese spots and it's pretty cute so I can see why.    The decor is traditional with the fish art, random music, and nice leather chairs.  These are pink!  We sat in a booth though.  Immediately we were provided with a complimentary appetizer of fried noodles with duck sauce and spicy mustard.  Seriously spicy mustard!  Our orders were quickly taken although when I specifically asked for lemon with my water that was ignored.  When I asked again, a whole ramekin was produced!    Molly S. ordered us an appetizer of crab rangoons.  My picture is of the remaining four since I neglected to take a picture until after two had been consumed.  Her fiancee also ordered some hot and sour soup and an egg roll.    I don't remember what Molly ordered, but her fiancee ordered this mound of rice with a variety of things in it -- eggs, some vegetables, pork, shrimp, and maybe beef.  I'd never seen such a thing.  It was cool!  This is where my review takes a hit.  They didn't have my favorite Kung Pao chicken.  So I kinda picked something random.  New Tze Chicken.  Next time I'll ask for a comparable selection to Kung Pao chicken.  According to the description on the menu, it has lightly fried chicken tenders, carrots, broccoli, and is served in a sauce with rice.  I thought it would have some spice element to it as well, but I must have misunderstood.  The dish was good, but I felt it was a little too sweet and the chicken was breaded just a little too much for my taste.    I must say that the service was very good though.  We were looked after, drinks refilled, and fried noodles were replenished.  One of our servers, seems they tag-team it, looked and sounded just like Jackie Chan too.  Not kidding.  I think if I ended up going back here, since Molly and her fiance seem to like it so much, I would just ask for help in ordering.  Looking at their website, it's pretty neat that you can place your order online for pickup or express dining too.",

Over the years,  any service problems were eclipsed by the moment.  Some years  - we had way too many people, and had to pair down - somehow they came through to serve us, everyone was fed, etc.   Well, I'm afraid those days are over.   On Christmas Day, we had whittled down our party to our family of three, and another family of three - total of six, including one 11 year old and one toddler.  We tried to get reservations, but they weren't taking them this time, so we just rolled with it anyway, they sat us quickly.   We sat for a few minutes, then I waived down the attention of the waiter, we ordered drinks, appetizers, meals.  And we waited.  Drinks came, some appetizers came. 30 minutes became an hour.  Then the appetizers came again. (What? eat them anyway?  okay...)  Then an hour and fifteen, we began looking at each other - no check in from the waiter - some folks who worked there were milling around the bar, rearranging glassware, no food came out.  Appetizers came out again?   Anyway - long story short 2 hours went by, no food came out, our Xmas dinner effectively sort of ruined.   Its always been slightly chaotic at the holiday, but this was down to just insulting.   We left 20 bucks to cover the booze and the appetizers and the wait staff to some degree who clearly were at the mercy of the kitchen.   Oh well. 17 years was a good run I guess.  We went home, fuming, foodless,  and frustrated - my family sad, in particular my dejected wife at yet another low point of 2016.",

I looked at the ticket and noticed one of the entrees was entered incorrectly and asked the person at the bar about it.  She assured me it was correct based on my order.  When I got home, I opened my bag to find only two entrees, one of which was the wrong item I had brought to their attention at the restaurant.  I returned to Shun Lee with the incorrect entree and it took me raising my voice on the third attempt to tell her what I actually ordered in addition to a printout of my order to get things right.  When I asked for a refund, she said she couldn't do that.  When I asked to speak to a manager, she stated there wasn't one on duty.  This place has gone down hill dramatically since the Yao family sold it.  We will never be back!!",

This place has been in Charlotte for as long as I can remember and if you didn't work on Colwick or drive down it everyday, you wouldn't know the place existed.  They don't advertise much at all and there really is no signage.  To be honest the outside is pretty stale.  But come inside and the atmosphere will blow you away.  You will think you are downtown or in Southpark.  No kidding!     Let me get some grub in my belly and I will lay it out for ya.  Update.  The owner comes over and asks how is everything and makes small talk. -customer service five stars  Soup was great I got the wonton soup to give it a whirl and loved it.    Crab ragoons, oh the crab ragoons!    I love these things and they have the best in charlotte hands down.   Spring rolls were good, and these things they called shrimp toast were ok.  I didnt know what to expect since I had never heard of shrimp toast but wth right?   Live a little.  I really dont know how to describe them. Soy cake with ground shrimp maybe?   They were a good appetizer and I actually like the flavor but the texture threw me through a loop.   Try em, let me know what you think....  Dinner comes right on time.  I dont give a crap what anybody says about food too long too early too whatever. My food, came out perfectly timed and the waiter was on point.   Oh dinner...  8 chicken, chicken 8,  something like that with brown rice.  Nom nom nom.   Excellent stuff.    So now I sit, on my couch, belly full of really great chinese and all I can say is this, my fortune cookie fortune was lame reslly lame, but the service, food, and atmosphere was freaking Awesome!

It wasn't until after we moved further away that we realized that it was much better than most quick Chinese restaurants. The dumplings are some of the best we've had in Charlotte. My fiance also only gets chicken wings and dumplings so he swears that Shun Lee has the best chicken wings for a Chinese restaurant. I doubt Shun Lee wants to be known for chicken wings, but they are for us!   I've ordered most things on their menu and I haven't been disappointed with them. It's definitely not a gourmet Chinese restaurant and I've heard it's not especially authentic, but if you want quick and inexpensive Chinese, you should give it a try!",

They've updated the look of their menu, along with that came price increases for their plates.     Service was good, absolutely no complaints there.  The gentleman who was our server has been there for YEARS and is always pleasant.    Our food came out within ten minutes of ordering.  Food portions have decreased and the taste and flavor is no longer there.  I've always CRAVED their Sesame Chicken because it was semi crispy and had a honey flavor it to.  No longer the case. I Ordered Sesame Chicken, which came with fried rice and egg roll but it wasn't good.  The sauce for the Sesame Chicken has been changed and I'm not a fan. The rice lacked flavor, was clumpy and portions of it weren't well mixed. The egg rolls have also decreased in size.   Restrooms need updating.  They are older, although clean the ladies room had the weirdest, foulest odor - perhaps a plumbing issue.",

Fair to say Shun Lee has a special place in my heart. As such, I was super excited to see they had a Groupon last fall. On my last day in the city thought I would try to use it and boy was it a disaster. Ordered three dishes since they wouldn't let me order takeout but I needed to use the $30 value at lunch. Crispy orange shrimp - sauce was gross straight out of a jar, fried rice was white rice with soy sauce. Singaporean noodles had zero flavor and low quality chicken meat. The only saving Grace was the sauteed eggplant that was honestly amazing! Frustrating that the food has gone so down hill and the service was also horrible. No water refills, questioned twice about my large order. Just awkward.",

As soon as we ate, our plates were cleared and the individual checks arrived at the table.  Complete efficiency all the way around. I can understand why people love this restaurant so much.  The atmosphere is calming and quiet.  The staff makes you feel welcomed and taken care of.  I had the Moo Goo Gai Pan lunch special.  It was okay; could have been a little more flavorful and definitely served hotter.  What they missed with that, they made up in efficiency.  My bet is that if I return there with another person or two, it would be a different experience than what I had with a large group of people.  For Chinese food in Charlotte, this is probably the place.  It feels like a mom and pop restaurant that is locally owned.  While there is definitely a place for PF CHANGS, I prefer supporting places that are not as grandiose and more home grown.   For that reason, I will be back to this restaurant!",

Now, I think these older single entree places don't have a chance against the buffet on Independence. I got the beef Lo-mein (pictured). Nice portion. I liked the thinner noodle (beef was mainly on the bottom) but really, no flavor. Bright side, the hot and sour soup was one of the best I've had. Service was actually pretty good too. But the atmosphere, ugh. There was a woman 4 tables away reading all the negative Yelp reviews out loud to the owner telling her she worked with a company that could delete them. Talk about a depressing background to your meal. (Lady, if you read this, you own a CBD retail shop. I know because we got to enjoy every word of your 20 minute sales call).",

I get that they were busy, but I'm sure this isn't their first Christmas day of being one of the few restaurants in the city open.  Ordered the Ma Po Tofu, which was decent, but I was wondering what peas and mini carrot squares (either from a can, or someone has amazingly precise dicing skills) were doing there.  We ordered white and brown rice for the table, but they only brought brown rice.  Once the 8 of us quickly finished that off, it took them another 5-10 minutes to bring out more rice.  Service was a mess, and the manager seemed to be as lackadaisical as the waiter was, when we pointed out that the appetizers and parts of the meals had not been brought out.  At least they comped the appetizers, but based on the service, I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "The best thing about Shun lee palace aside from the fact that its super close to my house is the food. Chinese food is a hit or a miss almost everywhere. Shun lee palace is a lil on the pricier side but its worth it. The sauces in the dishes don't have a typical chinese food thick consistency that I hate!! The meats are all very flavorful and the fried rice is so yum. I've only had lunch there but one of these days I plan on going for dinner. I'll add on to this review at that time ;o)",
