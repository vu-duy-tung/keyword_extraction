The salmon carpaccio wasn't very good at all - all I could taste was lemon, nothing else. We decided if we went back, it would only be for the happy hour food during the week.",

    "text": "I recently visited CO for lunch with my family, and we had a really awesome experience!  First off, CO offers selections that everyone can enjoy. My mom and I are vegetarian, my sister is gluten-free, and my dad identifies largely as a carnivore. Additionally, a few people in our group really love sushi while others won't touch it.  I shared bits of the the ahi poke, shrimp curry, and a caterpillar sushi roll. The shrimp curry was seriously SO GOOD - how can a Vietnamese/sushi restaurant do curry so well? I don't know, but I actually drank the curry sauce leftover at the bottom of the dish. No shame.  My dad enjoyed a curry noodle bowl and my sister indulged in a yummy (gluten-free!) hanoi noodle bowl. My mom also enjoyed a tofu banh mi sandwich, and everyone had a great experience with the range of food. Additional shoutout to the Singapore hot sauce that comes on the table - you are very good.  While we enjoyed lunch there, the overall decor and ambience seems well suited for the dinner/late night scene. The restaurant is centered around a beautifully decorated bar, and I can definitely see myself coming here for a cocktail and sushi one night. The service was a little slow, but the food is such high quality that I didn't mind the wait for it.",

Unfortunately they had a bit of a problem getting my Curry Laksa to me hot... Anyone that has ever eaten this dish from a hawker center knows it needs to be HOT. Good news is the flavored were rich, the management adjusted the check and we left happy. I know after two week we just experienced growing pains, we want it to work.PS The bartender made me two incredible Dark Rum Mojitos . Cannot wait to go back and give the fourth star. Update: I have taken out the Bahn Mi here at least three times since our initial dining experiences here. This is a great sandwich here and gets at least a half star more than my first two experiences here.",

I mean, there's a long list of somethings... And that includes the chic ambiance, good service and the fact that they're pretty kid friendly. That becomes an important criteria when you want to dine out at a nice place, and you want to bring the lil one along. While I've never sat at their bar, they have a really neat looking bar! During these summer months, I love sitting outside (despite the less than comfortable couches), sipping one of their many delicious cocktails and eating one of their delicious noodle dishes. The rice and noodle dishes are my favorite, but they have a pretty extensive menu ranging from Bahn mi and sushi to larger plates. If you haven't been there yet, you're missing out..",

The post also advertised that the boba teas normally will be priced at $3.50 but for the month of August they would be priced at $2. I tried calling a couple of time to make sure of the special deal and to see if you could order the drinks to go. I finally got someone on the phone and was told that they could be ordered to go but they would be regular price.  I was over the ordeal but my mother wanted to try them.   Upon arrival we asked the hostess about ordering the drinks and she directed us to the bar. When we placed our order we inquired about the special price but were told we had to join their email list to get the price. This was never stated before but the bartender said he would give us the special price. I ordered the honeydew melon tea with lychee jelly and my mother ordered mango tea with bursting strawberry boba.  I was not impressed with the drinks just like I hadn't been impressed with their food. The boba drinks were not like I've normally had before. The mango tea and the strawberry boba had no flavor. I only enjoyed the lychee jelly in the other tea. I would say the drinks are pretty Americanized just like the food and I will be sticking to the more authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte.   Overall the drinks weren't worth the ordeal.",

CO, I don't know if it was the hot sake, exceptional sushi, modern atmosphere or the prompt service but everything was outstanding and here's why:   I am in no way a sake connoisseur but that was some of the best hot sake I've had. The moment it touched my lips I said, Toi thich (I like).   We enjoyed a bottle before we ordered our sushi and it was so tasty that we ordered another. I highly recommend but why must it come in such small cups! Kidding, its a culture thing - I know, I know...   Now for the sushi - It was banging!  We ordered the Firecracker, Obi Tempura, Kung Fu Crunch and as Scotty P might say, I had no ragrets.  The Obi Tempura was my favorite; I now know why Obi- Wan Kenobi once said, \"the Force is great with this one,\" he was speaking about CO!  While only splitting three rolls, we were stuffed and Toi met (I was tired).    The atmosphere made us feel like we were in a modern, trendy bar as it gives off so much energy yet makes you feel relaxed.    And let's not forget about the service, well done.  Always checking in but not in the annoying mother-in-law way. The waitress was constantly refilling our water glasses and most importantly she asked us if we needed more sake. I did not catch the waitresses name but Xin Cam on (Thank you)!   Overall CO,  I shall be back!  This place is great for a happy hour, birthday celebration or a date spot. I can't wait for my next experience and once again, Xin Cam on!",

I like the Pad Thai a lot but it's not amazing and costs more than other local places. We recently tried the chicken katzu banh mi and found it completely lacking in flavor, though the house hot sauce is delicious so that made it still worth eating. I keep giving CO more tries because I like the variety of menu items offered as well as the ambience. Some of the dishes and the service need improvement.",

Nothing on the kids menu works for him, so we brought food from a place across the street.  During our meal, the asst. manager came over and informed us that outside food is not allowed because the owner deems it is \"bad for business\".  He asked us to at least take his food out of the container and put it on a plate.  I said ok - if they will be so kind as to bring us a plate.  I was shocked.  I got more and more upset as the meal went on.  Our child is 8, and we've been bringing food for him into restaurants in some form for 8 years.  It's the only way our family can enjoy dinner out.  We have only been met with a smile each time, until tonight.  I just paid over $50 to be insulted and upset.  I even spoke to the asst. manager to share my feeling before we left.  He shared it was unfortunate that we won't be able to come back as a family with food for my son. He reiterated that the owner finds outside food (even for kids) \"bad for business\".  I share this personal review because I feel that treating your customers poorly is \"bad for business\".  I was embarrassed and hurt.  No one should feel that way for a dinner that you pay for in what claims to be a nice restaurant.  So disappointed, CO.",

I really will keep coming back to this place to satisfy my Thai cravings. The interior is pretty modern and hip. the customer service is excellent!  I love that this place has good parking and is  close to other places that I need to usually visit- post office, super market, rite aid, etc.",

    "text": "It's okay. Service was kinda wack. Took 40 mins to get dumplings and an additional 10, about an hour, to get our food. Fried rice was ordered without certain ingredients but it came with ALL.  We were hungry so we accepted what was presented at the time since it was the only thing sitting at our table.  The server avoided us bc of the ticket time but that should never be the case.  The Korean bbq sandwiches (bread) was fried. It made it extremely greasy and soggy.  Honestly I would never return.  Due to the fact that the restaurant tried to replicate what Charlotte already had, which did not succeed, but the service was so terrible that we could not even place another order since the food took so long we were afraid of being late for our other obligations.  Plan on being there for at least 3 hours to be full.",

The noise was at first so loud it felt like we were in a club and I was worried I'd be able to even carry on a conversation with my friends but thankfully the music got less loud after a while. When I first sat down there was a short black hair on my menu. Ew. Talk about unappetizing. The service was great though and our waitress was very friendly and not overbearing. We did not have to wait log at all for our food. I got the five spice bahn mi and it was good and the price was decent but it did not come with a side which I found unusual. It's not something I'm dying to order again or craving by any means. The ambiance was cool and I certainly felt very trendy. Will not plan to return though. I'm sure there are more satisfying places out there.",

    "text": "What a cute date night place!  Came here on an impromptu date night with the husband and what a pleasant find.  It also happened to be restaurant week... Double score!  The decor is adorable with a cool wood structure in the center that looks like a futurist ice tree springing out of the bar.  I wasn't crazy about the height stools and tables(all raised) but definitely not a deal breaker.  I opted for the three courses restaurant week option which came with 2 cocktails.  My husband went for stand out items on the regular menu.  We tried three types of dumplings one of which was a part of my pre fixe.  The edamame dumplings were my FAVE.  The beef dumplings were my husbands fave( I wasn't crazy about the texture but they were tasty) The pork dumpling were just okay.  For the second course I had the chicken salad.  It was different and tasty but a one and done type of thing for me.  Next time I will try the spicy green papaya salad.  For main courses we opted for the Thai noodle dishes( yes it's Asian fusion). My husband had the drunken noodles which were very good.  They didn't use the traditional broad noodles but it was very tasty and the flavor was on point ( but if you like spicy, you may want to ask them to kick it up a notch). My pad Thai was DELICIOUS.  Very flavorful and the portion was pretty substantial.  I asked for some hot sauce ( I put that sh-t on everything) and I'm so glad I did.  To be clear the pad Thai did not need it as it was very tasty but I need spice in my life.  Their hot sauce is AMAZING!  I was tempt to ask for a bottle to buy and bring home but I refrained ( I mean it was date night and I truly didn't need 'hot sauce in my bag swag' but I'll be back for it)  All in all a great find and I will be back for the drinks and food",

The steak udon tasted better than the pad thai but was not impressive either.  Overall, I think this place is over rated.  the taste and presentation of their food is fast food restaurant level.  that was my first time and will be the last time visit the place.",

I wish I could tell you what it was but the waitress put in the wrong order and we got a sashimi appetizer instead which I didn't care for. My boyfriend enjoyed it though. We didn't realize we got the wrong dish until we saw the bill and the appetizer was $14 when we ordered a $6-7 dish. She didn't look happy correcting it. We pointed to the menu when we ordered. How much more accurate could we get? Anyway, we also got a ramen dish and the drunken noodles (i forgot I didn't care for it in Charleston!!). It was just salt. Oh dear lorddd!! Cooked with salt and probably liquid smoke. Very smokey. I can't describe it any other way. The beef was tender though but the taste ruined it. I didn't finish my dish. I was out of water and my tongue was just throbbing from the salt. The ramen dish was salt and water, again added liquid smoke. It was just a weird flavor I can't put my finger on. His portion was huge and he ate as much as he could before his tongue started throbbing too. Never. Ever. Again.",

Pork dumplings were pretty decent and the edamame was good.  If you're looking for a safe bet, these are the way to go.  If you're looking to jump a little outside the box, try the short rib bahn mi.  Great flavors and sauce!  Now let's transition into the Sushi.  I had a wagu rool that had cream cheese in it...sounds weird, but it works.  I've tried a few other rolls with salmon and tuna...all are incredibly FRESH (not fishy) and the rice/seaweed was not chewy like it's been sitting out for a while waiting to be turned into a roll.  I hope you've saved room for noodles.  Drunken noodles and pad thai are pretty solid.  Thai Basil was ok.  Big winner was the Vietnamese Ramen.  So much flavor in that little bowl, it was unbelievable!  Included are two pieces of pork belly...a nice added touch.  It's a fun place to get dinner.  They have a cute outdoor space, so I can see this being a popular spot to hang out during the summer.  Drinks are pretty good and the service is decent, but you come here for the food and the ambiance.  Great vibe!",

What they call the \"broth noodles\" are ok, but not good enough to make me forego the Green Curry usually. The wait staff is comically, and consistently, inattentive. And I think the prices are high for what it is, which is to say: middle of the road food in a setting that wants to be trendy, but isn't. The other locations look cooler. If you want better, similar food in a cooler setting, nearby, for better prices, head to Thai Taste or Zen Asian Fusion in Dillworth. Co is only a place to jump into if you're already at the Park Road Shopping Center and too lazy to drive to better options.",

I asked for chili oil and they gave me a spicy sauce (definitely not chili oil) it had a different taste to it and texture too (it may have peanuts). The broth and noodles weren't really hot like a ramen should be. The noodles got really mushy really fast and they had a \"different\" taste to them, not bad just different. The egg was good. Overall it was ok. Definitely would make some improvements. Not opposed to coming back and giving it a second try.",

Crispy wontons...packed with chicken! You really can't go wrong. The highlight was the plum sauce! Such a nice addition! I also tried the Curry Shrimp. I loved the curry sauce. It's really great for dipping the bread! I recommend ordering extra...you'll want it.    After seeing all the pictures on Yelp I couldn't wait to try pho - for my first time ever! I tried the Curry Laksa. The spicy broth had so much flavor. Geesh. I had no idea what to expect and this dish literally blew me away! If you're wondering what to order....get this dish!   I enjoyed the whole meal and my experience. I'm a huge fan! And I can't wait to come back!",

I felt like a kid entering Discovery Place... the inside is wonderfully designed. From the abstract art center piece to the modern colors... you forget for a moment that this place is nestled within a shopping center.   For all new visitors, order the Shanghai Chicken Wontons... you will be pleased! I have already planned to order the dumplings on my return visit because the wontons were prepared so well!   As far as the main course goes... it was filling and SPICY! I get discouraged sometimes when I order spicy food at other places and end up having to ask for hot sauce, but the spicy food here was all this country girl could ask for. I ordered the Curry Laksa and it made this chica cough and grab a sip of water. Now, let's be clear, I didn't cough because it was too spicy... lol it was solely because I was expecting there not to be enough curry spice and had already made up in my mind that I would reaching for the hot sauce to turn it up a notch.   I'm technically still eating and completing this review so know that I will be returning! Thanks CO for bringing a new spin to the Park Road area!",

From the stellar customer service to its welcoming ambiance, it's a great place to go for a fancy date night, or a chill evening with your friends.   My favorite dish is the Curry Laksa! I am not big on spicy food, but this Thai noodle dish does an excellent job of combining some mild heat from the yellow curry with the light, yet rich, flavors of the coconut milk broth. The flavors in this dish will make you want to savor every bite!    I have also tried other dishes like the Spicy Udon, but I'll let that dish speak for itself ;-)",

We totally planned to go here regardless of the sushi special, but it did sway our menu choices once we found out about it especially since CO's menu is super diverse with a lot of options.  We went early since we were catching a movie at Park Terrace so didn't have to wait for a table.  You can tell the restaurant got really busy all of a sudden since service was a little slow.  Our server Danielle was super nice and took care of us.  The entire table ended up getting sushi, but it all came at the same time with exception to a roll that had been fried (so understandable)... but still it was maybe a min or two before it came after everything else arrived.  Oh - half price off of Sake carafes was a nice pairing as well.  The lemongrass lychee was delicious and DANGEROUS.   They have OMB on tap here as well as Sapporo and other craft beer options (in bottle form).  Sushi was tasty.  I had the pork belly and the spider.  I know for those \"traditionalist\" sushi eaters, a pork belly roll, may not be your thing, but luckily there are plenty of other \"things\" on the menu.  Probably the restaurants interior and ambiance is probably one of it's strongest features with the wood slats creating a cool space that all stems from the bar.  Since we early I saw some couples with small children, so it's nice to see a kid friendly atmosphere here.  The later it got though, I didn't really see how kids would do in a loud, dim environment.",

The summer rolls came with both a seasoned vinegar and a peanut sauce that I loved. The spicy udon was full of fresh veggies and perfectly seasoned. And I probably could've drank the lemon truffle oil vinaigrette over the salmon carpaccio, it was amazing. We had both the strawberry spring rolls and the cheesecake rangoons for dessert and the only thing I would've changed is the cheesecake inside the spring roll and the strawberry inside the rangoon- they were both fantastic, I'm just greedy with the cheesecake.    We didn't have room to even crack the sushi menu but I'll definitely be back to try it!!",

I was making Vietnamese food at home when I realize the PERFECT touch would be pickled carrots! I neither know how to make pickled carrots nor did I think I had the time. I called CO and asked if they'd be willing to sell me a side of them. I expected they'd say no to my random request but I figured I'd try anyways!   The woman who answered the phone was so friendly and asked me a ton of questions about what I was making to determine how big of a side I was looking for. She talked to the chef and they agreed to sell me a side portion.  When I showed up, they not only packed up a side of carrots, the chef had included two sauces he thought would go well with my dish. They even threw chop sticks and napkins in the bag. He was right, the sauces and carrots made my noodles and veg POP!   They made my day :-)   Additionally, their menu is fantastic. They have a separate vegan menu with tasty dishes like the edamame spring rolls, bun xao salad, spicy udon noodles, tofu bahn mi and more options I have yet to try. My mouth is watering typing about them.   My only complaint (which actually comes from my husband) is that some of the dishes are on the more oily side. I think he'd give CO a 4/5 review for that. But this is MY review and I give them a 5+  Oh and super cute ambiance and tasty drinks. I ordered a bourbon drink with muddled blueberries last time.",

We ordered a carafe of the lychee sake, 2 specialty rolls, the wings, the bahn mi slider and 2 tuna tacos under $40 before tip. The lychee sake was so delicious, I would gladly order it next time we visit. Both rolls we ordered were fresh and beautifully presented. The wings were an order of 6 and they were the only thing I wouldn't get again. The bahn mi slider was so good I couldn't stop eating it! It was fantastic, spicy and crunchy. I dipped it in their house hot sauce with every bite. The tuna tacos were full size to my surprise; I was expecting tiny tacos in wonton shells. I would recommend these. Pro tip: go during happy hour and sit out on their patio. Great Tuesday night date night option!",

The menu does look fantastic and I will have to go again to try something else; I ordered the Green Thai Curry. I LOVE green thai curry and this one just wasn't anything special. Very blah. The portion didn't even fill me up. However, my friend ordered the pho and had plenty. I was impressed with the wines they had by the glass but they had no drink specials on a Monday night.  The service was not great. Our appetizer came a minute or two before entrees, even since we confirmed he had put our appetizer in after waiting for 15 minutes. I asked for a fork (to eat curry soaked rice) and had to wait for our server to run two tables other cards before he went into the back to bring me one. He also mixed up our tabs, but did fix it when we caught it. Again, this was a Monday night.  Finally, the ambiance. I was so excited to see the inside in person, rather than on instagram! However, NONE of their seats have a back! We sat at a bench table, but I noticed no other seating options had any back support. And I could barely hear my friends across the table. There was no cloth in there to absorb sound.  Overall, a giant \"eh.\" And a disappointed lack of excitement.",

Service is the main concern. Maybe it is growing pains, but the service is BEYOND terrible. The servers are running around, so maybe there aren't enough of them, but the service is slow slow slow. It took us 20 minutes to get out wine, which was just left on our table, un poured with Champagne glasses (instead of wine glasses. )  we also received our apps AFTER our food had arrived. And the soup I ordered was cold. cold.   Skip the sushi, it is overpriced and not creative or decent at all-stick to the small plates and noodle dishes. I know the soup bowels looks good, but they come out cold, and WAY to spicy to consume.   The dumplings are amazing, as are the spring rolls and the sauce is wonderful that they pair with them.  Drunken noodles and pad thai are very good, large portion, and they both have a bit of a spicy kick to them.   They dont do take out- wish they did!",

I had 8 items, 5 appetizers and 3 entrees--had family in town and meeting at my daughters house. I arrived about 6:35 to pick it up.  Hostess rang it up and said it would just be a few minutes.  The restaurant was starting to fill up and at least 4 other people came in to pick up take out orders which were ready.  I was still waiting and the hostess kept telling me just a few more minutes. Finally at 6:55 the manager came out and said the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 15 minutes.  They were still 5 orders ahead of mine.  I was not happy with that considering it had already been 45 minutes since I placed the phone order.  I saw people in the restaurant that were seated while I was there who were getting their food orders.  Some patrons walked out because their server told them it would be at least 45 minutes before they could get any food. However, the hostess did not share this with anyone that came in.  The manager was very apologetic and said they had stopped taking take out orders.  I finally received my order at 7:25--1 hour and 15 minutes after placing it-- totally unacceptable and no offer of compensation for the long wait.   Fortunately the food was good (except the chicken on the poke bowl was dry).  This is restaurant that is very near my house and used to be a favorite but something needs to be done about the service.  This was the second time I placed a take out order that took longer than promised.",

Today I call to see if they are open and like magic, someone answers and she is not nice. Whatev. I'm still excited someone picked up. She says their open until 11 and I say I'll call right back with a take out order. 10 minutes later \"the Time Warner Cable phone you called is unavailable.\"  What the hell! I give up!",

The decor, bar, furniture, plates, etc... are all impeccably designed and perfectly placed. The food is equally pleasing to the eye but the taste falls short on certain items.   During my first visit I started with the kimchi beef dumplings. The sauce that comes with dumplings are soupy, a little bland and just plain odd. Call me old-fashion but I'd like to control my sauce intake. I also prefer my dumplings pan-fried but didn't have that option for those.   I followed my dumplings with pho and unfortunately that was a big miss for me. The noodles were overcooked and the broth seemed like it was rushed because it lacked depth, flavor and attention.   On my second visit I came with two other people so I was able to split a few dishes. We split the curry laksa, drunken noodles and poke. The curry laksa wasn't bad but it lacked depth and some of the funk needed for a rich and delicious laksa broth. The drunken noodles were made with udon noodles, which made for an interesting twist. Overall the drunken noodles were a win in my book, which is something I can't say about the poke. The poke was way over-seasoned (too much soy sauce) and there was more crunchy stuff than actual poke. Overall, I'm not going to rush back here but the coolness factor and the curiosity of others will probably land me back here in a few months.",

Both times we had 2 appetizers and 2-3 entrees and we cleaned our plates like some starving kids and I wasn't completely full. The portion is smaller than most places. Given the same amount of items ordered at most restaurants, I would usually leave with a full stomach and possible leftovers for the next day.   Lastly, please add more items to the desserts section.

    "text": "Great food but longer wait.   First off, the food is amazing. We had 3 apps and 1 sushi roll.  The spring roll was huge and the fish sauce dipping sauce was slightly spicy and tangy.  The tiger sushi roll was unbelievable.  We got the tofu buns, they were good, but small and probably won't get them next time.    That all took about 25-30 mins, not bad and we still had our yellow curry shrimp coming.  About 10 mins after we finished, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything else.  Told him no, just waiting on the shrimp.  Twenty minutes later, still no shrimp.  Called him back over and he said he would see what was wrong.   All and all it took 1.5 hours to get our last plate.  When it came out, it was by far the best thing we had all night.    Earlier in our meal the manager came to our table to the right and had to apologize for the long wait on 1 of the persons meal and ended up comping their entire meal.  After our food finally came out and we finished, the manager came over and comped our shrimp (which was nice, but didn't make up for the extra drinks over the hour when we were waiting).  When we were leaving, the manager came to the table to our left and had to cancel their meal b/c they were waiting 45 mins and no food.  Needless to say, the manager was running around comping food left and right.    Hopefully, they are just working out the kinks as many new restaurants do.  If not, they will not stay open long giving out so many free meals.  Will def go back, just not for a few months so they can smooth things out.  Great atmosphere, great food but 2 hours for 3 apps and a sushi roll is not ideal.",

What I did not like:  The banh mi had too much meat and was soggy with too much sauce and unmemorable picked vegetables.  Normally too much meat isn't a problem, but proportions are an important thing for banh mi and these missed the mark.  There are only a handful of places to get banh mi in Charlotte, but I would not recommend here.  I also had the beef & kimchi dumplings and pork and ginger gyoza.  Both were overseasoned, but the gyoza was the beter of the two.  The beef and kimchi had an unbelievable amount of garlic which was not tasty.  I'll give the place another shot given that other menu items look really tasty, but on the banh mi and dumplings alone, I would pass.",

It only took ten minutes to get our food. We ordered the Shanghai Chicken Wontons, Pork Belly Buns and the Korean Short Rib Banh Mi. I was checking out what the people ordered and the ramen looked pretty satysfying. There was also a hot sauce on each table that appeared to be homemade. It reminded me of the garlic chili paste I have in my fridge. The guy gave me a cup to go and if you eat there, make sure to try some.  I don't know why I expected the buns to be steamed because they were actually buns almost like a savory doughnut. The pork inside was generous and flavorful. I think the wontons were nice but would have been yummier fresh. Again, my order was to go so that's all on me.  The bread is crunchy on the sandwich. I'm Fairly certain it was toasted.  The seating inside was fairly ample. The bar with the gorgeous wood structure is circular and people were eating lunch there at that counter/bar.  I saw that their iced coffee can be spiked with pecan Cathead vodka. Sounds pretty good!",

We initially tried to go here on a Friday night but were turned away at the door after learning of the 1 hour wait.  I guess we underestimated the popularity of this spot.  We returned on Saturday for lunch and found it much easier, getting seated immediately.  As others have described, this place aims to serve up some traditional dishes in a very modern setting.  There are noodles of various sorts, pho, curry dishes, and sushi along with other Asian staples.  The setting is a definite plus, there's a cool bar in the middle with this crazy wood thing in the middle going from floor to ceiling that made me feel like I was sitting underneath a mushroom.    Our waitress was prompt and on the ball.  She answered our questions and checked up on us regularly.  We went with the summer rolls to start.  The waitress brought out some really tasty house-made sauce to go with everything.  It was nice and spicy, reminded me a bit of Sriracha.    For mains, we did some beef pho and pork ramen.  The pho was pretty good, but light on the beef.  The ramen was a little disappointing to me.  It has some really tasty pork belly, but once I got through that I wasn't left with much in the protein department.  The other minor disappointment was that the ramen was all stuck together.  I'm by no means a ramen connoisseur (although my college-self may disagree), but I don't want my noodles stuck together to where I can't eat them with chopsticks unless I hack them to pieces.   Ramen aside, it was all in all pretty good.  We'll give it another shot.",

The ambiance was exquisite, the staff was friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the huge portraits on the wall and the modern vibe the restaurant exuded.  Ordered cocktails to start, specifically the Jalapeno Guava Margarita and the Sparkling Pineapple Sake. Both were to die for. Amazing flavor.  We love gyoza, so had to try their Pork & Ginger Gyoza as an appetizer. Juicy, fresh, and delicious. Highly recommend as a starter dish. Not too filling, but flavorful and worth it. We also had the Spicy Tuna Pressed Sushi. Extremely fresh and lovely presentation.  For our main dishes, we both went for a broth noodle bowl: the Viatnamese Ramen & the Curry Laska. Our server recommended the Curry Laska as the best thing on the menu. Though we hadn't tried everything on the menu, it was definitely the best place to start. Each broth bowl is humongous, so I wouldn't recommend getting too many starters or sushi rolls beforehand. Neither of us could finish ours main dishes. But the flavor was incredible and warmed us up on the chilly day!  Immediately made the decision after we left that we'd be back. Can't wait to try something new next time around!",

I had the Bun Xao with the tofu rolls as a starter and my husband had the pork bun and beef kimchi dumplings as starters and chicken curry for his meal  The tofu rolls and dumplings were decent.  The pork bun was greasy and heavy.  The bun xao was not very good.  Lemon grass sauce was inedible and the rice noodles were warm and over cooked.  My husband said the curry sauce was delicious but the chicken was too salty.  We went at a weird time in between meals so this may be why they were off their game, but we'll have a hard time going back to give them another chance.",

    "text": "First, the place is beautiful. It has a really cool big city (all in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center) feel and I liked being there. The lights are low, the music is on the loud side...so if you are on the grumpy side of flexibility, you should probably make a more conservative choice.   So with only being open a few days, the restaurant was crowded but we got the last table on a Wednesday night.   Really good: 1. Food - props for doing a really great job on Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, etc. I ordered the beef pho and liked it a lot. Nothing not to like.  2. Prices seemed reasonable to me 3. Atmosphere - awesome, cool, & fun!  Not great (yet) 1. Service - everyone is still figuring things out IMHO. Staff should probably learn the menu better and get really passionate about explaining dishes. It wasn't bad but it just needed to be a bit better and think this is to be expected during week 1. I imagine myself at a new job and feeling a bit clueless. 2. Kitchen - super slow but again, new restaurant and don't hold against them.  3. Music - a tiny bit loud but at the same time I kinda like it. I think though it might be hard to talk with a bigger group.",

    "text": "I think this place has potential to be excellent and I want to love it, but last night there were some issues. It took almost an hour for our sushi rolls to come out. Then another 40 minutes or so to get our main dishes. My dish came out 10 minutes after the 3 others at my table got theirs. The waitress did apologize a couple times for the slow wait times, but they really need to get it together.   The good: Sushi was amazing. We had the pork belly and the spicy tuna crunch. I also had the drunken thai noodles which were very good. Atmosphere in this place is amazing.   The bad: inexcusably long wait times for food. Also, my friend got the pad thai and it was extremely spicy, which is odd because traditionally it's not supposed to be spicy. It was hotter than my drunken thai noodles, which the waitress warned was very spicy when I ordered.  I'll give this place another try. They're brand new, so I'm hoping they'll work out the kinks in their service. Food for the most part was great.",

Was told 1 1/2hr wait even though there were multiple empty tables.  I think I ended up waiting 10-15 min for a spot at the bar.   Food was muh. Nothing special  Drinks/cocktails great, Highly recommendable! Music in background was a good mix of oldies and contemporary.  It's seemed to me the younger hip crowd who got reservations vs at the bar was filled with \"Myers park couples\" type  Dress on a Saturday night was far from casual.  In loafers, button down and jeans I felt slightly under dressed. Why do 23 yr guys feel the need to wear a sports coat!  However there were a few others sitting at the bar wearing leggings/uggs but girls get away with that shit.   It's strange that restaurant of this shorts is in a shopping complex such as Park Road.",

I had a sandwich which was completely unremarkable, it was assembled in a kitchen. It was not made with any speciality. It was like a Subway sandwich but super fussy and expensive.   Fussy is a word I would use to describe CO in general. A lot of effort went into the aesthetic but it felt cramped and sterile (how?). I sat in the front of the dining area at a two top. The idea of communal tables is lovely, if this was the case I would have felt less cramped. But our postage stamp of a table was far too close to my neighbor's postage stamp of a table. It was impossible to not to get my neighbors far flung pho on me a little bit.   I was also not super impressed with the service. Weekday lunch after one and our waiter must have had a hard shift cause was MIA most of the meal.   There are some really, really, really good spots for both bahn mi and pho all over Charlotte, this is not one of them.",

    "text": "After much deliberation on whether or not to hit up Doan's, Rai Lay, or Hibiscus, we decided on checking out CO for the very first time, and man I'm regretting not coming here before! CO is quietly nestled next to the entrance of Back Lot, and has dark windows to kind of separate your experience from the bustle of Park Road Shopping Center. When you walk in, you're immediately struck by the wooden centerpiece that has planks extending to all edges of the whole space. Very cool. Kept on marveling at it while eating.   While The Lady and I sat at the bar, Garrett helped us out a TON with recommendations, and also making sure that our plates came out correctly. Soggy bread in the shrimp curry? Let's replace it. Cocktail too bitter? Have some more champagne. Garret was AWESOME throughout our whole time here.  To drink, I ordered the Dark n' Peach, a slightly fruity and herbal variation on a dark and stormy that was complex and wonderful. For food we ordered: Spicy Crab Rangoon: The best cream cheese filling ever, at the perfect temperature. Would absolutely order again. Sushi rolls: Fiji Salmon, Tuna Tataki, Lemon Roll. All of these were great, but I have to side with The Lady - The Lemon one was very different.. it was more of like an aperitif sushi roll, if that makes sense. Very light and refreshing. Small dishes: Curry Shrimp. Holy cow, that broth was incredible. I could drink BOWLS of it. It comes with pieces of toast, but they were soggy at first, and once they were replaced it was much better (just as an extra touch to the dish).  I saw lots of cool things on the menu that I want to try for next time, so The Lady and I (or anybody else who offers first) will have to make a point of coming back, and soon!",

We started the night off at two different CO locations lol. Very confusing, I was at the Providence location and she was here at the Providence location. After driving to meet her at the park road location I was so pleased. As soon as I walked in the first thing I saw was the beautiful wooden tree and the 95.5 food score. The Providence location...not so much...I wrote a review about my 15minutes at the Providence location. Not very happy with the Providence location.  When I arrived I felt super bad that my bestie was still waiting on me but we laughed and made the best of it. I wasn't too fond of our server, but I ignored his horrible sarcasm remarks. I was just thrilled to see and spend time with my friend. We started our order with a glass of wine and an appetizer.   Food $5.00 for 4 Crab Rangoon's were AMAZING and a must order when you're here. They were not hard at all and filled with lots of crab. The Rangoon's were so good I walked politely over to the chefs and asked who made them. I hate that I forgot their names, but I did however capture a photo of them. Compliments to the CHEFS on these rangoons! I had to personally thank them, and thankfully in this restaurant, the chefs are in an area that you're able to speak directly to them. $12 EBI TEMPURA shrimp, avocado, cucumber, yamagobo, spicy aioli, unagi sauce this roll was really great I really enjoyed it and it's 8 pieces and the presentation was great.  $12 CATERPILLAR unagi, cucumber, yamagobo, topped with avocado, unagi sauce this was a traditional caterpillar roll.  $13 RAINBOW salmon, tuna, unagi, yellow tail, surimi salad, avocado my friend ordered this roll, she LOVED IT! $14 KUNG FU CRUNCH salmon, avocado, cream cheese, topped with spicy tuna, unagi sauce, spicy aioli, tempura flakes she also ordered this one, but we both didn't like all the cream cheese it was very overpowering.   And for dessert she made me try the $5 STRAWBERRY SPRING ROLLS nutella dipping sauce. These were INSANELY delicious but extremely. We both were quite disappointed in the server not informing us that the rolls were fresh out of the fryer. We both burned our mouth and shared this with him, his response... Oh sorry about that I probably should have told you.   Despite the horrible server, our experience was great because we were happy to have a girls night. The Chefs were awesome, I just wish the server had the same attitude.",

Garrett was our bartender and he was very attentive and easy to chat with without being overly chatty. He'd been there just over two years and knew a lot about the menu. We took pretty much all of his recommendations!  Drinks: I had the Orange Blossom, which at first was a little bitter for my taste, but Garrett heard me and was nice enough to add a little more champagne to even it out.   Food: started with the spicy crab ragoon dumpling and YUM! Next came out our two rolls of sushi to share: the FIJI Salmon and Tuna Tataki. The salmon was rice-free and very fresh. The tuna was excellent as well and a great combo of flavors. We also later added a lemon roll which was very refreshing but definitely different. You have to like lemon a lot. We also ordered the curry shrimp from the small plate part of the menu. It took a long time to come out and Garrett noticed and checked. It came out not long after that but the bread was soggy. Garrett noticed and put in an order for new bread for us, which was much crispier.   The food was pretty great and Garrett was freaking awesome for looking out for us. The only thing I would change is just making sure every item served is top quality.",

    "text": "The sushi is more like 3 stars since it's pretty average, but the menu is very extensive and accommodating to more tastes so I bumped it up to 4 stars. The gyoza appetizers are worth getting - I tried the edamame one and it was super unique. I may try to recreate it at home. The sushi was good, but not super impressive. I tried the tiger roll, which was ok, and the super crunch roll, which was fried so it tasted pretty delicious. It was a lot of food so I couldn't finish (rare for me). I got the blackberry fizz cocktail, which was fruity and refreshing. I also tried the honeydew melon boba, which was also fruity and refreshing, but really sweet. I like the interior design, but overall not a place I'm planning on coming back to anytime soon.",

She didn't apologize once for the inconvenience.  This is my first review ever.  I have never been treated so poorly by anyone in the service industry.  CO, you've lost a customer for life.",

Almost like a mini club lol I liked it.   As a starter, I got the Crab Rangoon Dumplings. They were hot and fresh. And DELICIOUS! They were tiny but the perfect size to hold me over until my entree came.  My main dish was the Korean Short Rib Banh Mi. It came with a little cup of kimchi slaw. I put a little on top of the short rib and it complemented it nicely. Extremely good food. Good service from our waiter.   The hostess however was not very friendly. She looked like she did want to be there. Or even seat us. She just looked at us without even saying hi hello welcome.. she was just like, \"how many.\" and looked bothered.. A hostess is the first encounter you really have at a restaurant.. maybe she was having a bad day. It was very busy too. But it would've been nice if she treated us with just a tad bit of kindness. Because it was kind of awkward. Oh well. Still a great restaurant and I will definitely be coming back.",

I love the huge pillar in the middle that fans out to cover the entire ceiling. The bartender was quick to create our cocktails while we waited for a table. There was a 30 minute wait for our group of 3 - we called earlier and they do not take reservations.   The menu has a diverse range of options which was great since our group had a range of dietary preferences. I started with the beef & kimchi dumplings which were stuffed full of beef and in a delicious sauce. Seriously - I was trying to discretely soak the dumplings completely in the sauce before every bite. I had the pad thai as my main (just because the person sitting next to me at the bar had it and it looked and smelled AH-mazing). It could have used a touch more flavor... and cue the delicious Singapore sauce that they brought to the table in a little bottle. That definitely kicked up the spice level to closer to what I wanted.   The only downside to the experience was that we did not see our waitress often. Someone in our group had a long wait to eat her appetizer because she needed a fork. Our waters remained empty after the entrees arrived.",

I have never had a bag sushi roll (knock on wood), but this was pretty good! You can definitely get a roll like this somewhere else for a little cheaper. But it was fresh and yummy!

Nite ) and empty on a late lunch day 3 weeks ago. Both times I have had great service and delicious food.  Starting out,  its ultra modern with a gorgeous Wooden tree in the middle of the bar. Speaking of the bar..Outstanding Mixologist there. ..they muddle fresh fruit into sake and alcohol and even non alcoholic sparkling drinks. I have had the blackberries with  lychee and sake  and also the Cucumber mint and ginger drink. Refreshing and delcious! I have now had the Banh Mi Sandwich twice - first time it was the Caramel Pork and tonight it was the Pork Belly. The best I have had in Charlotte and I have been here 12 years!  Crispy fresh bun with sweet cucumber and hot pepper slices and a  great sauce! Tried the fried Rice tonight and it was a nice size helping with fresh tomato and peas and fresh cilantro --loved it. My sister is a vegetarian and they had a vegan and also a Gluten free menu. She had Spring Egg rolls with lemongrass. They were great. We also tried the Green Papaya Salad...that was crisp and fresh and authentic ! It is in the Old  ( Newly Remodeled) Park Road Shopping Center...Don't miss this place..You will come back again and again!",

They come with lettuce and carrots, wrap those babies up and slam them in the sauce they serve with them, you won't be sorry. They are so fresh! I mentally said, damn when it hit my tongue. I went with what the server recommended for an entree, which was the Korean short rib. It was delicious! The slaw on the side was very fresh and delicious. I also order a drink called the thai basil Collins. This was refreshing and reminded me of a mojito. If you like basil and mojitos, this is your go to! Honestly, the decor is bad ass in here! Not to mention a very good music selection. I think I was greeted by next episode. But left on a electronic jazz type mix, I'm digging it. Overall, this place would be an AWESOME date spot. Not sure the attire during lunch or dinner, I went casual and have no issue. Go enjoy this place!",

I really liked the center bar and communal tables. My friend and I started with gyoza and summer rolls. Both were tasty. I liked the gyoza more then the summer roll. I ordered a lychee iced tea (was not happy that they charge for refills) but it was tasty if you just wanted one. My friend got friend rice and I got a coconut soup that was highly recommended.

I looked over the menu before hand and decided on the pho bo vien, a noodle bowl made of meatballs, and rice vermicelli, herbs, served in a beef broth. I arrived soon after their opening time of 11:00am.  There wasn't a designated front of the house person but the staff did a good job of rotating the waiters in and out as guests arrived.  The place was still pretty empty with a few tables occupied. I was seated and told of the half priced Pho bowls special.I promptly ordered my Pho bowl. As I waited, I looked over the menu. There were a number of items that caught my eye, especially the chili wings, the ahi poke, and the Dark & Peach cocktail. Wait time was a little longer than expected. I received my hot and fragrant pho bowl with all the fixings after about 20 minutes of waiting. I dove in to find a bundle of noodles covered with broth. By the end of my meal, I was still digging through the noodles in search of more delicious broth! I would've enjoyed more broth and less noodles. Next time, I will make a request for less noodles to avoid this issue. By the time I left, the lunch rush was in full swing. There was also a greeter at the front of the house who wished me well as a I left the restaurant. I'll be back to try the bar bites, the cocktails, and maybe a different bowl.",

All amazing. The food is really delicious and the pairings of sauces to go w/ the meals compliment the dishes nicely. I also thought the price point was reasonable. Almost forgot, the elderflower Spritz cocktail I enjoyed, definitely a refreshing cocktail! We will be back!",

Table service leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, I questioned after our food came whether it became self service.   The floor was very slick throughout. I was able to speed skate to the bathroom from our table with a form that Apollo Ono would admire. A couple of female patrons wearing footwear less suited to skating were seen holding the wall walking to the restroom from their table. Wear your nikes.   Seats have no back support and are generally uncomfortable.   Food lacks flavor and portions were kind of on the small side.   Plenty of other places in Charlotte better than this to get those curry and lemongrass flavors.",

The broth did not compare to the more rich, complex flavor you would find at several other less trendy (and more reasonable) places in Charlotte.   The atmosphere is hip, but is more of a bar that happens to serve a variety of Asian dishes.",

Being from NY, super hard to find food, atmosphere and awesome music with an urban vibe in Charlotte, but this place nails it! Oh and the food is amazing AND you can eat healthy out. Besides having my favorite wine by the glass, love the Miso Ramen, yum! Great place to bring visitors from out of town. Enjoy!",

They came with a peanut sauce but I don't like peanuts like that so I used the other spicy sauce it came with to dip in. The rolls were filled with cilantro, mango, lettuce, peppers, avocado, and cucumbers. I was really a fan! I wish the cilantro and lettuce had been chopped up a little more finely thought because with certain bites it all came out. I ordered the firecracker roll and my boyfriend ordered the spider roll. Both really tasty! Wish they had more tempura options. Overall a great atmosphere for date night or casual lunch with friends! They have a large bar area also!",

    "text": "I have been here twice to celebrate birthdays.  The first time I was super excited about the experience.  Ultimately for a table of 4 we waited for over 2 hours for full service.  When the food arrived, twice a friend received a noodle bowl that was so under cooked that the manager tasted it to confirm.  The rice in the bowl I ordered was overcooked to mush.  I ended up throwing it away.    The second time, the service started off extremely well with an energetic server but sadly the service started to get slower and some drinks were forgotten altogether.  The food took hours to make its way from the kitchen.  We were there for about 4 hours.  The worst part was that after our cards were taken, it took an additional 30 minutes to get them back for signatures.  The establishment was not fully and we were seated right in front of a computer docking station.    Overall,  the food was pretty good.  I might try a seat at the bar for happy hour but I would not entertain a full service dinner.  The kitchen was very slow.  Every time I peered into the open kitchen there were several people just standing around.  It was pretty frustrating.  (Considering the fact that I have ran a full kitchen before.)  If they can organize their ability to emphasize the customer experience and management of ticket times, they have the potential to be awesome.",

    "text": "Possibly my favorite new restaurant (of the moment)!  From its cool, yet cozy decor, to the unusual, eclectic Asian Fusion menu, CO had nearly everything it takes to get my vote!  I tried 2 different types of Dumplings (Beef & Kimchee, Edamame Gyoza), and they were both DEE-Lish!  There were so many items I wanted to try on their diverse menu, but I randomly chose Hanoi Noodles...and I was NOT disappointed.  Very rich and tasty...with a generous portion of noodles, sausage and shrimp!  The only downside?  Upon entry, I waited by the door several minutes before this aloof, rather unfriendly Hostess stopped by to assist me...with no greetings, no apologies for waiting, nothing.  She just lifted her head up, as if to say, \"What do you want\"??  She also did not even bother to say \"Bye\" when I left the door.  However, during my meal, an Asian Hostess (Owner maybe?) stopped by to ask how everything was...which sort of made up for the near-rude reception by the younger, brown-haired Hostess.  Also, I only saw 2 waitresses there the whole time...and the restaurant was fairly packed.  Although I did have to wait several minutes for my waitress to appear at my table, she did just fine (friendly, cordial...and even apologized for the wait)...but I did notice that some other guest walked up to the Asian Hostess/Owner to say that \"his\" waitress hasn't come by in over 15 minutes, and that he wanted water!  If only this restaurant hired an extra waitress and better train their Hostess to be more \"inviting\" (as well as \"present\" near the door/podium), I would have gladly given this place 5 stars.  No matter, I WILL return...possibly as soon as this weekend!",

    "text": "My husband and I had a decent meal and overall experience here. I'd give them 3.5-4 stars overall, which sounds like it's right around the average. While people have complained about the service before, we had great service which is why I'm giving 4 stars over 3. If it were just based on food, it would be closer to a 3.   We were in around 8ish on a Wednesday night. It was busy when we arrived, but were able to get seated quickly. The inside is beautiful, especially the golden arch over the bar. We were greeted quickly by our server, who was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu. She took time to explain it all, and even to try to teach me how to use chopsticks!  I started off with the basil thai collins cocktail, with gin, basil, honey syrup and lemon. It was very good. My husband had the blackberry infused sake. I'm not a huge saki lover but this was enjoyable.   Judging by reviews, we started off with the beef and kimchi dumpings. I would have liked more of a beef predominance there - and there is some spice here! You get four dumpings, which is pretty good. We also ordered the tofu summer rolls - I thought these lacked on flavor, so I needed to use extra hoisin peanut sauce. I wouldn't order these again.   Our main meals were better. We split the chicken and shrimp pad thai, which was very good. We also had the rainbow sushi roll. The one thing I wasn't crazy about with the sushi rolls was that they were a little soft and didn't hold together well. My rolls all fell apart before I was able to eat them, which was a little disappointing. The fish was good though.  If we return, I'd love to try a wok noodle dish and some more of the cocktails.",

They took almost 40 minutes to come out and when they finally made it to the table were ice cold. Our waiter redeemed the situation to the best of his ability, apologizing for the delay, explaining the kitchen was backed up, etc. Our mains came out quickly after the appetizer, thank goodness.   We shared the pressed spicy tuna sushi and green papaya salad. The sushi was slightly overpriced IMO but good -- not the best I've ever had but flavorful and fresh. The salad was the surprising winner of the night! The crunchy texture and vibrant flavors all really combined well for a solid dish and reasonably priced at $11. I'll be back over and over again for this one!   Knowing we were on a time crunch (trying to make a movie at the theatre across the shopping center), our waiter brought our check with our entree which was appreciated. He even made some pleasant small talk about what we were seeing and other films showing. I wish I could remember his name because he really made the night for us.",

Delivery was prompt and packaging was good so nothing spilled during transit.   I am not one to complain about prices if the food is good. I saw photos of the establishment and they did an impeccable job with their interior so I can understand the high prices to match but food should be decent, at the least. I was hungry and extremely excited to try their Curry Laska... however disappointed that it was so salty that I couldn't eat it. Total waste of $15 for this dish. The pork belly buns were delicious at this point and the deserts were fun as I love sweets and trying interesting concepts. I may try other things on the menu but next time, I will opt to dine in.",

    "text": "The best way to sum up CO: your favorite Asian dishes served in a modern, swanky atmosphere. You fancy huh. Example: I like to wear sweatpants to grab pho or a banh mi. This would not be the spot to do that.   So, the highlight for me last night has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant and that's not CO's fault at all. Luke Kuechly walked in and stole the focus of every female. And basically all the males as well. The guy sitting next to us jumped up and left his date to go shake his hand. Keep pounding.   This place is really pretty. It's perfect for a date night spot or to kick off an evening with the girls. I saw a group of ladies laughing over drinks while doing a Christmas exchange type deal at their table... and of course whispering to each other about Luke Kuechly.  We started off with the Dark N Peach and the Jalapeno Guava Margarita. For all of you who follow my reviews, you know I'm a sucker for any kind of spicy drink. This was pretty tremendous. I'm not one who typically orders bourbon cocktails when I'm out, but the Dark N Peach was good as well. There's a sriracha bloody mary type drink on the menu. I can't wait to come back and try it.  For food, we went with the beef and kimchi dumplings, drunken Thai noodles, spicy tuna pressed sushi, and fresh summer rolls. The pressed sushi was like little building blocks of deliciousness. My favorite was the dumplings. My dinner pal isn't the biggest fan of kimchi, but even he thought they were fantastic. I had debated between a ramen bowl and the noodles. The couple next to use both got big bowls of brothy goodness. I was immediately jealous. I'll be back for you next time.   All in all, we had a great experience. The service was good. Our server answered all our questions and helped us debate between menu options. I'll definitely be back. I'm sure Luke Kuechly will be, too.",

Dora here. You can't tell by this photo that it was only about 15 degrees outside, right? Yowza! When we left our house, we trekked through at least six inches of snow on our driveway. So when Ernie rattled off three choices for lunch, I was all over CO. Know why? Soup. Pork dumplings. And because our son has been traipsing all over Vietnam for the last couple of weeks, and his photos are stunning! So, hands down, we were headed to CO, and it didn't disappoint. Such an intriguing interior with so many different elements, including this centerpiece that fans out from the bar. Reminded me of a tree. They offer plenty of seating options, including an outdoor area. And, no, we didn't go outside to check it out. Brrr. Our food came out quick and our server was helpful and knowledgeable. Actually, we talked to a few staff members and all of them were gracious and friendly.   I chose the Malaysian Chili Wings appetizer, marinated in coconut milk and tossed in pineapple, ginger, lemon grass and chili sauce. These crispy wings were outstanding, both spicy and sweet, with a fruity favor that kept me coming back for more.  The Korean Short Rib Banh Mi was packed with tender braised short ribs, kimchi (a spicy pickled cabbage) and aioli. The sturdy bread held up to the generous portion of meat. The combination of spices paired well with the smoky meat, one of those dishes where the heat doesn't really kick in until afterward. This was my first time eating Vietnamese food but it will not be my last.  Dora here. When pork ginger gyoza (dumplings) are on the menu, I am not about to pass them up. Soft as pillows and so flavorful, I could eat these every day! Had we known the Pho Ga, shredded chicken and bunches of noodles in a hearty beef broth, bowl would be so huge, we could've shared. But, I don't think I could've swayed Ernie from his sandwich. lol. This is one of those soups where your spoon never comes away empty-handed. Quite a few flavors swimming around in here to tickle your tastebuds. Yum! Perfect for a frigid winter day and I even brought some home. Win, win. This is definitely a place we'd love to come back to or pop in if we're in the area. Especially during the winter.   What about you? What's your favorite go-to food in the winter? What's your favorite soup?

Comes with 6 shrimp in a spicy curry sauce and crispy burchetta on the side.   Pork Belly Steam Buns- I was a little disappointed because I love the pillow like buns that these are usually served on. They gave two buns which is pretty good for the price.   Beef and Kimchi Dumplings- My favorite! 4 dumplings with an amazing sauce over top! Dumplings were soft and tasty! Only $5 for 4 dumplings.  Beef Pho- (my date ordered this) I tried it ans trust me there was plenty to share. They served jalapeno, sprouts and other sauces were served on the side so you can spice how you like!    Our server was hard to understand with her strong accent but she delivered great service!   Next time I come I must try the cheesecake wontons!",

I really liked the endamame spring roll. This was super cool. Try it with the hot sauce and you've got something awesome. I also liked the yellow curry. Can't remember the name, but it's their signature so they'll point you in the right direction. The firecracker sushi roll. I loved it. Gid thought it was a bit to spicy. We like heat so, if you don't like heat try something different or ask them to go light on the hot sauce because the roll itself is really well done. Hugs- M",

I called them and the hostess said we were next on the list, probably about 10 more minutes. 30 more minutes go by. We finally just walk up there and she says they paged us. We never got paged. After we were finally seated we put in a drink and sushi roll order. It took about 20 minutes to get those. Much to my dismay, they changed the curry laksa. Now it's extra $4 extra to add shrimp! Y'all, I brag about this dish all the time. I brag about this place all the time. I tell people if I was on death row, this would be my last meal. I finally get my $19 curry laksa and what is this? A mountain of al dente noodles in a very thick gravy sauce with 4 shrimp and a skimpy amount of chicken. I'm pretty sure they used to use vermicelli, but these were thick ramen noodles. I'm all for paying for an epic dish, but I was SORELY disappointed. As I'm eating I'm also noticing the interaction with the staff. Our server was really nice, but she seemed like she was on the verge of a breakdown after one of the food runners practically knocked her over without acknowledging her existence. The whole experience made us feel kind of icky. We'll give this place another chance because I loved this dish so much before they changed it. Hope our next experience is better!",

    "text": "I came here last night (Thursday) with a group of 5. We arrived at 6 to take advantage of HH specials ($3-$5 food specials) and 1/2 sushi, which they offer week days from 4-6:30, but HH goes till 7. We sat at a table vs. the bar and were told we would only be able to take advantage of the HH specials at the bar, which is typical. We were a little disappointed, but could still take advantage of 1/2 off sushi, plus on Thursdays they offer 1/2 off all sake!  My favorite sushi rolls of the night were the Firecracker (tempura shrimp, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna, sriracha, spicy aioli, masago) and the Jersey roll (tuna, yellowtail, spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber, spicy aioli). Can you tell I like spicy?! We also had two beef rolls, which were unique- made with kobe beef and wagyu beef. All of the rolls ranged from $12-$15, but with half off sushi specials they were definitely worth it!  We also tried 3 different sakes, two of which were sake infusions served cold. The cucumber sake was refreshing, but the blackberry sake was the winner of the night. It was so delicious! If you're not a fan of typical hot sake, you should try the infusions.  Overall, great time at Co last night. We saw a couple of noodle and rice dishes come out of the kitchen and they looked amazing. We will definitely return sometime soon!",

    "text": "Usually I order pho for takeout since I walk from home, but today I sat at the bar and enjoyed my meal in-house.  It was a slow Monday lunch hour and not busy.  I ordered an appetizer of spinach and water chestnut  dumplings in a lemongrass sauce that arrived in the proper amount of time.   The dumpling was cooked perfectly and I liked the cream sauce except it needed more salt IMO.  Unfortunately they did not have salt shakers avaliable,  but I ate it anyway.  I also ordered a bowl of pho ga with a good portion of shredded chicken.   It was piping hot and full of flavor.   It did,  however,  take some time to arrive even though the restaurant was not busy.  I agree with Jeff's review that the ratio of Thai basil to cilantro was heavy towards the cilantro.   I prefer to toss the cilantro for the taste of the Thai basil which is more authentic and available in abundance with most all the pho places in CLT.  Tameerah waited one me and did a great job.   Overall. I'm glad I stayed to eat.  Oh yea, I still took home a big container of left over pho for the road.",

Let's set the scene: I arrived back in Charlotte from a vacation with my family and messaged my girlfriend as I saw a promotion on FB that the next day was National Mojito Day and CO (listed all locations in other states as well as this Charlotte location) was inviting people out to celebrate with $5 Mojitos various flavors.  I arrived 10minutes after my girlfriend who I invited and her sister who Birthday it was and they were seated at a high top table with a look as if I steered them wrong. I entered and immediately thought \"How Cute, I can't believe I've never been here before as I frequent Chopt, Juice Bar & other businesses in this shopping center\". I approach the ladies and said \"Happy National Mojito Day\" they smirked and said he hostess said there is no such thing happening. I asked our server for a manager with the post pulled up from the CO facebook page ready to show HOWEVER I didn't need to after I mentioned why we were there he welcomed  us and I informed him that the hostess was unaware as well as the server and he apologized and went to speak with both of them as well as other staff to inform their customers.  We started off with Pineapple Mojitos which were Ooh so good and after one I needed food, well we all needed food because it was dinner time and we hadn't ate so we requested a menu and began to order. I had the curry shrimp dish which was full of flavor and a sushi roll. The food was so full of flavor and fresh, I raved about it on the phone with my husband on the way home. We will definitely be back for date night hopefully there isn't any specials announced that the staff is unaware of.",

The water and Pepsi also taste like bleach, but you don't need much to wash down the little you'll eat here. Getting generous with two stars to be honest.",

I love the happy hour and daily specials that allows you to try a lot of different items on their menu. My favorite this is the curry Laksa. It is the best! Not to mention it is huge! Bartender suggested that i take the broth home( because you will have a lot left) and reheat and add some rice! Yes thank you, a nice substitute the next day! Prices are reasonable and the drinks are great, try the sake on 1/2 carafe days(Tuesday and Thursday)!",

They have different specials all throughout the week as well as a great Happy Hour Mon-Fri from 4p to 7pm.  This visit I ordered the blackberry sake carafe that was so good, great suggestion from our bartender Brandon. And it was 1/2 off because it was Thursday. For food I had the Spicy Crab Rangoon, Kung Fu Crunch sushi roll and the Masa Ramen. I could have ate like 3 orders of the Crab Rangoon because it's just that good. The sushi and ramen were delicious as well, lots of flavors and cooked perfectly.  The atmosphere is more upscale compared to your more traditional pho/ramen restaurant that makes it a good place for a date night or birthday dinner.",

We got edamame, spring roll, summer roll, my man liked the wings so much he ordered seconds, crab rangoon, and crispy cheesecake wontons to finish. Everything was great. Edamame a little bland, but the house hot sauce helped with that. Andrea was our bartender and was very efficient",

The staff is wonder and always friendly and I am so excited to recently learn that they have a loyalty card to where you can possibly get cash back! (More reviews on this later). The happy hour specials are my fav because some the best apps are on the list with an added daily drink special. My favorite has to be the $5 cocktails on Wednesday's with spicy crab rangoon as an app just have to make sure you are there between 5pm-7pm. This particular time I tried something different from my usual curry laska. I ordered the spicy pho with shrimp and  as bad as I feel I think I've found a new \"usual\" lol. For anyone who loves spice this is the perfect dish for a cold winter night. I wish I knew the recipe so I can make it myself but until that day this business will always get my money.",

At that point I don't know if my husband ordered it because he wanted one badly or he felt obligated.  Either way the drink should have been comped, in our minds if there is hair in the drink what is in the food?  Pork belly buns were the highlight of our lunch. I ordered a cabbage salad which was good. My husband ordered the ramen. It was....meh. 14 dollars for a bowl of soup? Maybe if he ordered pho his perception would change but even those prices seemed a little steep.   I loved the ceiling fixture. Chairs were really uncomfortable,  especially for those who are really short. Do I dangle my feet? I can't prop them as my legs are short. I sort of felt like a kid eating lunch in my elementary school cafeteria. I hate giving poor reviews, especially when the service is great. In my opinion at the very least a manager should have come out to apologize for a hair being in our drink but that's just me. Either way we probably won't be back.  **I have spoken with a Manager who was apologetic and attempted to resolve over our experience and invited to return. We appreciate his sense of urgency.",

My tuna roll was delicious and my daughter's pho was excellent. The portions are plenty big, and the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable...especially when compared to the many, many overpriced eateries around Charlotte. We had 2 entrees and 2 appetizers (no drinks) ...for $40. You're not going to get any better than that! I highly recommend this place. Oh, and the outside patio is very quaint and pretty.",

    "text": "Since it opened, I've been intrigued by this place but upon reading other reviews, have hesitated on actually making the trip. We finally decided to grab some dinner here but, unfortunately, it was not what we had anticipated and hoped for.  I think the menu is unique and special and the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. The service on the other hand (for what seemed to be a slow evening) was extremely slow and all of the employees resembled zombies. Literally. Zombies. No one smiled, they moved in slow motion and there was no customer service.   After we were seated for a few minutes, our server came over to take our drink order. We each ordered a water, I ordered a Vietnamese limeade and he ordered a beer. The Vietnamese limeade was not for me but he enjoyed the beer. When we were finally able to order, we asked for the beef and kimchi dumplings and the crab and pork spring rolls to start then he ordered the Korean short rib banh mi and I ordered the Korean rice bowl. The appetizers were amazing! The dumplings were so flavorful with this hidden spice that I loved. The spring rolls were good too (love the pickled carrots that came on the side). When we received our entrees, they appeared to be delicious. While he enjoyed his banh mi (I tried it and it was good), my Korean rice bowl was utterly disappointing. The rice was extremely over cooked and mushy and there was, surprisingly, no flavor.   Overall, it wasn't the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant but it will be awhile before I return to give it another shot. (Especially if the customer service stays the same.)",

Part of that may have been because they had a special for 1/2 off sushi rolls for international sushi day. Otherwise it would have been a pricey lunch for three rolls. We tried the Tiger Roll, Pork Belly Roll and the Salmon and Avocado pressed sushi roll. They were all incredibly fresh and made with quality ingredients. We are avid sushi eaters and consider this to be great sushi for the 1/2 off price. With that being said, I'm not sure I would pay the full price for this sushi, particularly during lunch hours. The rolls range from about $10-$14 each which isn't extravagant but also isn't a great deal either. I think we would definitely enjoy this for dinner next time, I wouldn't mind paying that price for dinner.   Service was excellent, our waiter (I can't remember his name) was extremely helpful and accommodating. We will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes they have there.",

Worse, a line of chefs and bartenders didn't even acknowledge we were there.  Giving CO then benefit of the doubt with 3 stars, since we haven't had the opportunity to actually try the food.

I was shook that I really enjoyed the bubble tea I honestly did not think I was going to like it that much but it was really good! They also added lychee jelly & that paired really well with the mango, but the tapioca balls were too hard and chewy. We also ordered the geisha sushi to share, and I had a pad Thai and my mom had the spicy udon. The sushi was okay good but my pad Thai was a bit too dry, I felt like if there was more sauce it would've been perfect! I also tried some of my mom's spicy udon and it was SOO good! Overall everything was good and I would totally come back to tryout their pho & banh mi. Way to go CO!",

Order it with a side of peanut sauce - even more heavenly. This was the first time I'd had dessert at an Asian restaurant and let me tell you - I could eat those cheesecake wontons every day! The owner was even at the restaurant the first time we were there and took time to talk with tables and make menu and cocktail suggestions.   I saw recently they have a great patio space with new beautiful furniture I didn't notice the first time I was there. I'll be enjoying sake cocktails this summer!!  Also - they have a vegan and gluten free menu! :)",

    "text": "I was a little leery of trying CO after reading the reviews the last few months, but after my first visit, I'm cautiously optimistic that they've found their groove. A girlfriend and I got there around 6:20 on a Friday night; there was only a 15-20 minute wait! They took our number to text us when the table was ready, which was nice since you could shop around the shopping center if you needed to kill more time without fear of not hearing your name or a buzzer being out of reach. By 6:30, the waiting area was completely packed.  Our waiter, Elliott, was pretty much on point (except for having to remind him a few times that this nerd couldn't use chopsticks and needed a fork). We split a bottle of wine - all the bottles were priced between $30 and $38 - and started with the beef and kimchi dumplings ($5 for 4). They were fantastic. For dinner, my friend got the thai green curry ($14), which she said was really good but left a funky taste even after she got home and brushed her teeth, and I got the pork belly bahn mi ($9.50). I had read the other reviews that said there is A LOT of bread on the bahn mi, and you guys weren't lying. Once I got past the initial bite, I was okay, but I would've preferred more meat and less bread.  We split the bill evenly, and when it came, we both thought it was too low for what we'd gotten and had to double check it. For such a sassy, hip restaurant, we fully expected our bill to be more than $63 total.  The only reason I knocked off a star was ambiance/seating. We got lucky with a table on the other side of the waiting area wall, but there were about nine 2-top tables in front of it by the window that looked tight, with a couple of those tables being right in the waiting area. The seating is tight, but the music is so loud and the crowd so lively that you can't hear the conversations of the people next to you. Be prepared to yell a little though!",

I'm never going back to this place! Oh yeah they give you a super small portion of noodles!",

I had mine also with level 2 heat level.  Both of us were really pleased with the food, and I was glad that I stayed at level 2 for the heat / spicy recipe.  The staff was attentive and always helpful.  We sat at the bar while we waited, and they were also perfect.  The cucumber infused Sake was wonderful (I normally am not a fan much of Sake).  The inside design was really cool, with this amazing design from wooden planks, that rise from the center of the bar and over the ceiling.  There were old pictures on the wall of Nobu McCarthy (I believe) that added to the atmosphere.  Couldn't have been happier.",

Long story short, we were seated greeted, we ordered the pho because it was half off all pho, so our plan for Sushi was put on the back burner. I ordered the beef, Col the chicken. Also the ginger pork dumplings. It was delicious, large portions and came out quickly. This seems like a great date option or nicer dinner option if you're in the park road area, but still not super fancy. I wouldn't roll up with a hangover and messy bun to grab some Asian food here, but it's not too fancy either.",

    "text": "This place is beautiful and the decor is something you have a hard time looking away from. It's fabulous.   We went on a Friday evening around 7pm and got right in without waiting. Great! The beauty of this place is all in the center of the restaurant where everyone is sitting at high tables. There is a half wall around this area, and then there are 9 low tables set outside of the wall. If you are one of the 9 unfortunate souls who gets sat at a low table, which we did, you are instantly transported back to your 10 year old self expecting an adult table but banished to eat at low kids table outside of the action. You get an excellent view of the wall, and just the tips of some peoples heads. The \"kids\" tables are very close to each other, so you get waitress butt in your face. My husband didn't mind.  The outdoor seating area is basic.   The staff was nice.  We received an offer in the mail to try their restaurant buy one get one meal free. When we got there, we asked the waitress which meals this offer applied to. The catch: we were only able to choose from 3 rice dishes to get the deal, all of which we did not especially want. We're adventurous though, and tried them out: the Com Chien and the Korean Rice Bowl. They were okay but we wouldn't order them again. The rice bowl was extremely spicy (and I like spicy). My meal came out about 10 minutes before my husbands. I ended up sharing mine and we ate my entire meal before his came out. None of the staff mentioned anything, no apologies from staff. No updates about his food while we waited. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. Maybe that's how they do things.   In my opinion, if you're a new restaurant (I know they're a chain) trying to get the nearly neighborhood locals to try and dig your restaurant, don't force them into ordering something they may not like with a tricky stingy coupon.",

    "text": "I came here tonight after hearing about the incredible service and impeccable food. However, I am leaving CO feeling very conflicted. Myself and my two friends came in tonight about an hour and a half before closing. In my opinion, that is completely acceptable (I am a server at a restaurant and personally don't feel this was rude). Our server made us feel very rushed the entire time. I could understand if our server was trying her best to accommodate, but she actually avoided our table and we had to walk around and find her at one point.   My boyfriend ordered a lychee boba and she told us they couldn't make them. No biggie. The three of us ordered several dishes to share so we could try a little bit of everything. The dish I was most excited about was the Edamame Gyoza, so we ordered it. Twenty minutes later the server comes back and says the kitchen can't make it. She asks us if we would like to order another appetizer, so we order the Crunchy Spring Rolls. Twenty minutes later, another server comes back and says those can't be made either. I'm not one to complain about service because I know how it is working in a restaurant, but this experience left me a bit perturbed. Half off the stuff we ordered couldn't be made. If we had come in twenty minutes before close, I could understand. We were there 90 minutes beforehand. It seemed as if the kitchen didn't want to make anything so they could close up even though they still had a while to go.   The food we did get to eat was great, although I'm leaving hungry. Not sure if I would come again and play Russian Roulette with the kitchen and see what could and couldn't be made.",

THIS PLACE IS AN INSULT TO VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, FOOD AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF! it's that fucking bad. They must of used the unwashed ass hole of a pig to make their pork banh mi, I don't know what they are thinking or how could they possibly fuck up the taste of simple Vietnamese cooking.    And the prices wow seriously, ok I'll be considerate and understand that rent for that area is probably way higher than other locations and the place looks nice. But u are selling a menu not the view.   No it's not one bad experience so it's not from just a bad day, it's being dragged out with friends that also wanted to try it. Their comments and opinions are the same as mine but since I payed I'll comment on it.   The American people that eaten here and liked it. It's ok it's not your fault u don't know what things are suppose to taste like.",

Service wise, the host wasn't welcoming at all. We only saw our server twice, once to take down our order and the last time was for our check. The person that brought out our food didn't seem like he was well trained as he spilled our entrees on the table.  Here is the nitty gritty on the food. My friend and I ordered: Thai Chili Chicken Wings Kimchi dumpling Bun Bo Hue Curry Laska Papaya Salad  If you're Vietnamese, you will be disappointed. All of their food had a strong perfume taste and smell to it! Especially the papaya salad! It tasted like soap! My friend and I both had a bite and the scent was so strong we had to ask one of the servers to take it off our table. This place really love their lemongrass because almost all of the dishes had it and it was so overwhelming. The dumpling was good and it tasted fresh but not good enough for me to come back for it again. Some dishes just isn't meant to be changed or \"infused\". I feel like most restaurant like these put fusion in their names to justify their overpricing.",

Just pick something, anything, from the list and it will amaze you!  I'm usually a bit hard going on eateries. Check my other reviews. I mention this for comparisons sake. I'm not a softball kind of reviewer.  The only small gripe I have with CO is this: please lose the high top tables. I truly don't enjoy dangling my legs while I dine. High tops look fabulous in pictures but \"in use\" ... not so much.  That being said, the menu is so wonderfully executed, I would be willing to sit on the curb or on a turned over painter's pail. Don't be fooled by the strip mall location, CO is an Exquisite dining experience!",

From curry, to sushi, to poke bowls, to Vietnamese, to Banh Mi, to Thai food, etc. They have something for everyone!   Tuesdays and Thursdays they have half price sushi! Also, half price sake! Their sake infusions are made in house and they are delicious. Blackberry, pineapple, cucumber, and lychee/lemongrass.  Their cocktails are actually quite good as well. A bit more expensive than I think they should be though. They also have happy hour food each day. They are small bites, which can be a nice compliment to other dishes.   The curry laksa is their signature menu item. I can't get away from ordering it because it is so delicious! The portion is also huge, so I always get two meals out of it. Everyone at the table tried mine and wished they had gotten it, too.   Service is a bit slow, but they are kind.   Like I said, solid option. Maybe not the best Asian food I've ever had, but I will be back again and again for half price sushi and the curry laksa.",

I was excited when it got picked for a team lunch.   We were seated right away with a large group and no reservations. Unfortunately they were out of several tea options that one of my co-workers tried to order.   The menu is huge. Trying to decide what to order was so hard because everything looked good. I ended up getting way too much food because I was bad at deciding what I wanted. Luckily I got help eating some of it.   I started with mango summer rolls. They were very refreshing and delicious. They came with a fairly big portion too. For my main course, I got three Curry Laska and the Firecracker roll. The Firecracker roll was really good. The Curry Laksa was amazing. It's one of my favorite dishes I've had at a restaurant in Charlotte. It's a huge portion and has a good heat to it. For dessert I got tempura bananas which were amazing as well.   I tired some of my co-workers Drunken Noodles and Wonton Cheesecake both of which were very good. Everyone really liked what they got.   CO is now one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already!",

    "text": "My wife and I were in this area on New Year's Day looking for places that were open. We decided to come here since we love Vietnamese and Sushi.   Looking over the menu, we saw several items that interested us, but some of the prices didn't really reflect what we would receive in return. We eat a lot of sushi and have been to a lot of different places throughout Charlotte. That said, we skipped on the sushi just based off of the price.   To start off, we ordered the pork and crab spring rolls. They were just okay and we probably would not order them again.   For my entree, I decided to go with the Short Rib Banh Mi. It was a decent size and the price was about the same as any place that has Banh Mi. However, it was just okay. I've had much better at hole in the wall Banh Mi shops. The short rib itself just didn't live up to the expectation when you see the prices and style of the place. My wife had the Vietnamese Ramen and she thought it was just okay as well. She said it wasn't better than Pho, which she normally would have ordered.   Overall, our experience was very meh. I don't see us coming back. The prices just don't reflect what we received in return. The staff was nice and the environment was great, but nothing else was close.",

It's located in the Park Road Shopping Center so there's plenty of parking. It can get crowded and crazy though.  The inside is very modern and clean. Concrete, clean lines, and a huge wooden feature that extends into the whole restaurant. It was freezing and the music was too loud to really enjoy the ambiance. Their cocktail menu looked good even though we didn't order anything. We did get several rolls including the pressed sushi rolls. Those were mostly rice and a little sliver of fish and avocado so they were really worth the money, but the rolls were really good. I ended up ordering dessert which was fried cheesecake and it was amazing. I would go back just for that.   Overall, it wasn't one of our favorites, but it was good and a good experience.",

    "text": "My wife and I had been meaning to try CO for a while. On a whim, on a Saturday, on Valentines day weekend, we decided to walk in and give this place a try. Not surprisingly, we were quoted over a 1 hour wait. Not a big deal, as we have passed a fair amount of wait times at the bar. At the end of the night, what impressed me the most about this place was the attention given by the wait staff and manager.   First off the ambiance of this place gives off a club feel. A clean-cut look, decently loud club-like music, and a breathtaking center bar with arching wood beams set the stage. My wife and I grabbed a glass of wine each at the bar to start. The bar selection was both decent in reach and price, with the focus being on local draft beer and mixed cocktails.   After what felt like a while, we went back to the front desk to check in on our wait. We found out that the guy working the front desk was actually the general manager, Mike, who turned our night around. This guy was slammed with phone calls and new customers walking in the door, however he handled it like a champ. On top of that, he took the time to walk us through the menu, point out his favorite items, and gave us regular updates on our table to make sure we were seated quickly and were happy. That kind of detail goes by a lot of people.  The meal was also fantastic. We shared the beef and kimchi dumplings, pork belly buns, and the thai green curry. While the dumplings were spicy (how I like more than a few aspects of my life), they were delicious. I also enjoyed the pork belly buns. However, they both paled in comparison to the green curry. My wife even drank the sauce straight from the bowl! It was a bet, however she didn't seem to need much persuasion!  What started out as a ho-hum experience turned into a great night thanks to the great staff at CO and the wonderful cooks churning out great meals. I look forward to going back soon.",

Angela (my lunch date) was already there!  I was greeted by Taheerah (our waitress) everything was swell! We ordered the Chili wings, pork and crab spring rolls and both of us ordered the curry laksa. Everything was going smoothly til Taheerah asked if we wanted her to wrap up the wings.. Angela said yes. Taheerah came back with the box, placed on the table and said, \"I would pack the food for you but I won't!\". She then laughed a little then walked off. Angela and I looked at ea other and said what's going to happen if she did. The wings going to blow up!! \"Well that was rude!\" When she came back later. I asked if she can finish her sentence in why she can't pack the food. This time don't laugh. She explained that she couldn't because she didn't have any chopsticks or tongs. She did offer then to pack it. I'm like no it's ok. I jut wanted to hear why..  The point to this is. IF she set the box down and have us pack it ourselves. I'm ok with it.. There's many places that do that. But no other places have said that to us before.. And that's my problem.  Taheerah did contact me via Yelp message and apologize. This is not usually her. And to come in this week for a complimentary gyoza after 4pm. At the end of the day it isn't about complimentary food. I'm in the service industry.. I rather have good service than free food. This incident leave a bad taste and it will be awhile before I introduce this place to any of my friends.",

    "text": "Met up with a couple friends during the lunch hour. Great new addition to Park Road Shopping Center.   If you are looking for great ambiance, the interior is fresh, modern, and cool. Ladies, careful when wearing heels...the floor is slick, or maybe it's how I walk. I dunno. Also, it could have been the company I was with or the acoustics, but at times it was difficult to hear my friends. Come with loud talkers.  We ordered 3 dishes: Hanoi noodles, com chien, and Thai green curry. Wow. Each dish was flavorful and spicy. I had to cut the noodles with a side of white rice just to tone it down a bit...but I loved every bite. Now that you know they start out spicy, you can ask them to go easy. If you want to add more fire to the sauce, they bring a bottle of their own mixture and it does add more kick. Plenty of food, be ready to take home leftovers.  The service was great. Very friendly. No judgement here when you ask for a fork.",

My husband had the ramen. He thought the broth was good but the ratio of noodles to broth was way off. Too many noodles.  We will go back once they have worked out the kinks.",

    "text": "We had a good experience here. Brought my parent here to try this place knowing they can appreciate some Vietnamese foods. I'm not going to lie, I was a little nervous bringing them here because they are normally pretty critical when it comes to eating out and especially at a restaurant not owned by a Vietnamese person attempting to specialized in Asian cuisines. To my surprises, they actually really enjoyed their Pho orders! That is saying a lot! They normally aren't accepting of all the Pho broths around town but actually approved of this place impressed me. Although the Pho broth was yummy, the portions weren't much and the parent were left a little hungry still. Oh! That Singapore sauce is so so good though!  I got the Bun Bo Hue and to my surprise, the flavor WAS ON POINT! Now, I can't say the same about the meat tenderness nor noodles however, I'm quite shocked the broth was perfect. It was extremely, extremely spicy making it a little overwhelming to finish (and I normally can handle a little heat!).  Even my parent said it was way too spicy!  On the downside, the meats & noodles for the Bun Bo Hue were undercooked, making it hard to chew & eat. Definitely needs some improvements on that.   Btw, be prepared to come and wait. We ended up walking around the shopping center to kill time while waiting for our table. The setting was nice, clean and modern but has a cold feel to it. Restaurant doesn't exude that warm & inviting feel when you walk in...felt like a little warehouse and kind of out of place decors & seating arrangements.  A little overpriced in my opinion for most meals. I mean, I can find a cheaper bowl of bun bo hue or pho at Doan's or Saigon Palace (nearby Vietnamese restaurants) for $8-10 whereas you're paying $12-14 bucks here for the \"hip & trendy\" atmosphere really.",

    "text": "I was very pleased with my visit to CO today. I'm always excited to try asian fusion restaurants because they always bring creative twists to some of my favorite dishes!   The place itself looks very modern and new. If you're looking for a place to eat soupy noodles in your sweatpants after a crazy night out, this is not the place for you. If you are a stickler for authentic food, this isn't exactly the place for you either. BUT- if you want to try some delicious sounding dishes, then we've hit the jackpot.   What I ordered: 1. Malaysian Chili Wings (small plates): For $7:50, you are given 6 deliciously marinated wings. Slightly sweet from the coconut milk, but also a little spicy/tang. These wings satisfy all the tastebuds. I wish the wings were more crispy though. That would have provided the idea texture.  2. Curry Laksa ($15): I read somewhere that the broth is cold, that is not True! The curry laksa comes with chicken, shrimp and noodles in a scrumptious broth filled with coconut milk flavor. The soup was not too watery and not too viscous. It was the perfect medium. Plus- it's perfect for insta photos!  3. Drunken Thai Noodles ($14): My friend ordered this and I'm kind of sad I didn't because I wanted to eat her dish...This was so full of flavor. I would even recommend getting these noodles over the curry laksa.   Service was great. Even though it took our server a while to come in the beginning, he was extremely attentive afterwards (frequently asking us how we were enjoying things and constantly refilling my water). Overall, I had a great experience here and can't wait to come back. I've got my eye on the pork belly banh mi!",

The other 3 were poor...definitely would not order again.  The Edamame Spring Rolls were tasteless and greasy.  The Avocado Ceviche and Tofu Buns were not memorable.  Very hard to find decent Asian in Charlotte.  On a positive note the prices are reasonable.   Service: 3 stars Shaky and unsure.  Also still wondering why they brought all 5 dishes for the table at one time (when some were small plates/appetizers.   Atmosphere: 5 stars Decor is amazing.  Very unique and modern.

Our food came out really quick and our hungry bellies were more than satisfied.   We ordered the beef and kimchi dumplings as an appetizer. They were a perfect mix of spices to make them spicy, but still tasty. I'm not a huge fan of things being spicy just to be spicy, so these were great. We shared them and both wished we had gotten our own. My husband even drank the rest of the sauce with a spoon!  I ordered the spring geisha sushi roll. It was light and fresh and actually stuck together when trying to eat it with chopsticks. I appreciate that in sushi.   My husband ordered the spicy udon. This was very spicy, but still also had good flavor. The wok noodles had such an interesting texture (in a good way). There were a good amount of vegetables and chicken in it too. He was extremely impressed throughout the meal, he also blew his nose multiple times. It was really spicy. There was also this other sauce that they bring to the table that he added into it. He loved it so much that he got a small container of it to go!   Overall we loved CO. The atmosphere is fun and the food was really good, each dish tasted very different from the other. My only complaint would be that we ran out of water a few times and the water had to be taken to the back to be refilled. This was hard when you're eating spicy food and need water right away haha. Other than that, it was great and we will definitely be back!",

Kind of annoying and don't understand it, but whatever. We waited an hour and a half for our food but it was worth the wait.   For the first course we tried the pork & ginger gyoza and the beef and kimchi dumplings. The beef and kimchi was ok but the pork was delicious. With the 1st course we also had the Sparkling Pineapple sake which was very good.  The second course we had the Vietnamese Chicken Salad and the Green Papaya Salad. Hands down the Papaya salad was amazing. Was so tasty and the flavors were just very intense.  For the 3rd course we had the Korean Rice Bowl and the Curry Laksa. I was so jealous that my husband ordered the curry. That was the best thing I have ever tasted. It was so rich and creamy. The Korean Rice Bowl was very lacking. Way too much rice and not enough meat. The flavors weren't that great either.  For dessert we had the cheesecake wontons and Strawberry Spring rolls. Both were great but the Vietnamese coffee with the Pecan Vodka was amazing. The coffee was so strong but amazing!  Overall I really liked this place.",

Everything we ate tasted awesome, but the service was the worse we have ever had. We ordered 3 courses off of the restaurant week menu, and it took us 1 full hour to be served the first course.  We ended up taking our entrees to go because it was taking so long for everything to come out We ate 2 of 3 courses in the restaurant and were there for 2 hours. The fastest thing to be brought to is was the check,  Our drinks were never refilled and it took 30 minutes to get a beer.  If you love Asian food and spending hours in a restaurant with no food or refreshments, go here. If you like efficient and attentive service go elsewhere. It's too expensive to be treated poorly as a guest.",

Love that they take reservations, but you don't always need one - but it is normally bumping at dinner.  Food is so good! I've loved so many things!  -PORK & GINGER GYOZA - hard to go wrong with dumplings/potstickers but these were great. 4 in a dish and a light sauce for dipping.   -CURRY LAKSA - Soup/noodle dish. The first time I had it was perfect, most recently it was much too spicy! I'd ask if they are able to tone it down (unless you love the super hot curry spice). My lips were burning this last time. Still has amazing flavor and is a huge portion - always at least 2 meals for me!  -PORK BELLY BUNS - liked these, got them steamed  -GARLIC SESAME TUNA TACOS - great flavors, but really the ingredients are all things I love so I'm kind of biased when restaurants put these things together. Plus they are tacos - so yes, love these.  WAGYU Sushi - loved this dish too.   Overall, great experience because the flavors are so strong, and if you share a few dishes it's like a party in your mouth. I recommend going in a small group and sharing, or at least with a date that doesn't mind. :)",

The prices reflect the upscale facade. The first time I came I got pho, and the second time I got ramen. Both times the meal left me wanting more in terms of flavor. It's not like it's bland, it's just not worth remembering. It lacked the depth of flavor you can expect at other ramen places around Charlotte. It was comparable to a slightly higher end instant ramen. The one thing I can give it is that the service was great both times. Great service doesn't make up for the uninspired eats though. If you're looking for a good Asian place, my advice would be to pass this one up.",

The dumpling pastry is a little too thick for my liking but my gf liked them. The filling was flavorful. I enjoyed the crab rangoons and loved the sauce. The spring rolls were okay. They just didn't make me go wow and I've had better nuoc cham. Maybe I expect it to taste fishier but I know I'm not in Vietnamese town. Sometimes you can't fight your palette no matter how hard you try...  The sushi was solid but just didn't fix my craving. We tried to go to sushi guru which is usually my go to but that's another story. Regardless, the food was good and I need to come back to try out their other dishes. I could smell some of the other tables near us who didn't order sushi and I was totally intrigued so I'll for sure be back. The prices are on par for the area and I didn't see anything super crazy.",

I came here for a lunch with coworkers and as usual the food that I got did not disappoint. This time I decided to give their Thai green curry a try and it was super yummy. It had the most flavorful amount of spice without being too incredibly over bearing with it. The mix of vegetables and shredded chicken made the curry very savory and I enjoyed adding my rice to the whole thing and mixing it all up together. Once I did that the rice soaked together with all the curry flavor and was absolutely amazing. And it was such a great amount of food so I had leftovers to take home and enjoy later. Definitely check out CO for a wide range of noodle, rice, and sushi dishes. Both times I have been were amazing and I can't wait to go back.",

It was pretty good, the broth was pretty flavorless without the optional \"miso chili bomb\" that you needed to ask for. A little pricey for what it was and would've been nice if they advertised that their pho contains peanuts on their website (which I looked at beforehand). They have a really nice hot sauce that has good flavor and heat to it.  All in all, it was good but overpriced and a little disappointing.",

The food has always been good but the only reason for the 4 stars is of course service this place changes staff more often than I change my under garments. (I know what your thinking, Yes everyday! lol)  It is cleaning, the hostess staff has been pretty regular but they are not the friendliest or welcoming or inviting, but ignore them and sit for a pleasant dining experience.  I really like Saki, they always have a good wine for the wife. If I recall correctly the the grade was in the mid to high 90's.  Give it a try it wont set your life on fire but it is good food with okay service that will pleasant please you.",

This most recent time, a few of us got mocktails which were pretty refreshing. We sat at the bar until a table outside was ready.   The patio is super chill and tucked in the side of the restaurant, with plants bordering the seating area.   We each ordered something different. I got green curry chicken with no rice, and they loaded the bowl up. It was perfectly spicy and very tasty. My dad got the pad Thai with chicken. Not quite as flavorful as it could have been, but still good. My husband tried a tofu dish that he enjoyed, and my mom had Thai basil chicken.   Every time we come, the food is consistent and good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is always a pleasant buzz.  If you haven't been to Co, check it out next time you're feeling Asian!",

    "text": "The first time we came here we had an amazing experience. Our server was a rock star and the food was delicious. We had some friends coming into town and they wanted to have some good asian food so we decided to come here.   We came here for a late lunch and got sat right away. Our server was nice but distant. We started off with the beef and kimchi dumplings and the wontons. They were both great. I love the spiciness of the dumplings and the sauce for the wontons were delicious. Last time we were there my husband was able to get the papaya salad for approx $4. When he tried to order it again, the server refused to let him order it. I think that's so ridiculous. What's even crazier is that last time I was there (only a few weeks ago) I got the spicy pho with rare beef, and I added a poached egg and instead of the noodles I wanted udon noodles. I did get charged for the poached egg and approx $1 for the charge to switch the udon noodles. I ordered the same thing again and I got charged several dollars more. I got the poached egg and the udon noodles with the rare beef. When we got our check, we noticed an upcharge line with $3. We asked what it was and the server said it was to switch the udon noodles. Are you kidding me?? $3 just to CHANGE out noodles? I'm not asking for additional noodles but to switch it out. Last time our check said UDON NOODLES and it said $1 or $1.50 I don't remember which one but it did NOT said UPCHARGE $3. That is so upsetting. Yes, it's a few bucks but seriously? It seemed like this server wanted to add as much as she could to our bill and if it was that much why wouldn't she tell us it would be that much for an upcharge. We tried to tell her we didn't pay that much last time but I don't think she believed us.   My friend got the kimchi bowl and she liked it overall but complained and said that there was so much rice in the bowl it was hard to enjoy. Little toppings but too much rice.   Overall, the experience was not nearly as good and it was very inconsistent. Next time we are there, I'm just gonna request the same server we originally got. I think it's crazy to not let someone order a salad when they ordered it a few weeks ago as well as charge so much for a change of noodles and not tell them. I don't mind being charged but to be charged almost double than you did a few weeks ago is nonsense.",

    "text": "Asian food is practically my life so of course I was excited to come here while I was visiting a friend in Charlotte. After a full day of brewery hopping the day before, the only thing I had on my mind was a big bowl of noodle soup.   Atmosphere: super trendy and hip on the inside. With this massive beautiful piece of wood architecture that starts at the bar and makes its way up across the ceiling. It almost looks like a giant tree trunk with its branches covering the whole top. The seats are comfortable, the kitchen is open in the back so you can see what's going on and the bar looks really nice. I would say this is good date material.   Service: 4/5 customer service was great. They offered suggestions, refilled my water, and were very nice.   Price: 3.5/5 the prices here are a bit higher than other places with Asian fusion food. But because they do offer a variety of items and because the restaurant does look and feel a lot nicer than a hole in the wall type of place I guess I can understand. Their appetizers are $8 and under, dishes can go up to $18.   Food:  - 4/5 kimchi dumplings: this was sooo good. It was $6 for 4 dumplings which I think is kinda overpriced. But the taste was definitely there. The filling was moist but it was the dumpling sauce that it was in that was the real winner. I could drink that stuff. It was soy sauce based but a bit sweet and acidic that balanced well with everything else.  - 3/5 spicy pho: let's be real. This was basically a bun bo hue but not as good. And I LOVE bun bo hue. The rare beef slices were super thick which is not something I'm used to in my Viet soups (they're usually thinner so they cook quickly in the hot broth when mixed). The soup was super oily and a bit sweet which was a bit weird. The noodles were good but everything else was just okay. Nothing special. I honestly wouldn't get this again.   I do hear great things about the drunken noodle and pad Thai. So if I were ever to be back, I would probably try those!",

We had a short wait, but the hostess was friendly and once they cleared the table we were sat relatively quickly. I ordered the Thai Green Curry after discussing a couple options with my waitress, she was super helpful.   At first I was put off by the price...and then I saw the MASSIVE portion. This was two meals, you could definitely split with someone. It was so yummy. The broth was thick and spicy without being overbearing. The rice was perfectly cooked. I had tofu in mine and it was also cooked perfectly--crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Others at my table ordered sushi, pad thai and rice bowls that all looked fantastic--we all left completely satisfied.",

    "text": "I love this place! First of all, I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine, so the different Asian fusions they have on their menu are so intriguing.  On this visit, my friends and I met up to join Co in their 3rd year anniversary! We were able to quickly get a table for 8 and also in time to still make happy hour. They have a great selection of bar bites and on Tuesday's they have 1/2 off sake carafes. I opted for the lemongrass lychee and it was amazing! I also ordered the pork and crab spring roll (not pictured) and the spicy crab rangoons (AMAZING!) As it was their anniversary celebration they were offering the curry laksa (with chicken) broth bowl for $3; which is a fraction of the regular price. The broth is so flavorful and the toppings (cucumbers, Thai basil, bean sprouts, bok choy and rice noodles) make for a huge portion.   I would highly recommend this place and we are planning to meet back up for happy hour soon!",

They did well with the seating, I had assumed there would be a wait on a crowded Thursday, but we were seated right away.   As others have said, service was a little slow, but not as bad as others have said. We ordered a bit of food, so that kept us occupied. My friend enjoyed his pad Thai, and I enjoyed the rolls I ordered. The only one I wouldn't get again was the bang bang shrimp. There wasn't anything wrong with it, especially if you like California roll style sushi. I don't, but I enjoyed it as a once and done. The cocktails were fantastic, and the wings I definitely recommend. I will return.",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant of all time. I have been coming to CO for two years now. My friends (and Instagram and Snapchat followers) know I am here on a weekly basis (often multiple times a week....I should have ownership rights at this point) and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I will start by saying my mom grew up in Southeast Asia- she lived in Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, so she knows real, authentic Asian food. I took her here and it's now her favorite Asian restaurant in Charlotte and can attest to its authenticity. The ambiance, decor, music, service, food and drinks are all excellent. There are great specials, but my favorites are Tuesday/Thursday for the half priced sushi rolls (from 4pm-7pm) and half priced sake carafes (all day). I am here weekly on one of the two days and usually sit at the bar. Garrett is an awesome bartender and Soo, the manager, is wonderful and has become a great friend. Oliver has also served me and is so friendly and gave great recommendations. If you sit at a table ask for Oliver. I truly have never had a meal or experience that I haven't enjoyed. My favorite drinks are the Jalapeno Margarita (has a good kick) and the Cucumber & BlackBerry sake infusions (both sweeter sake options). I would probably list half the menu if I mentioned what food items I like. All the sushi is delicious (my go-to is Kobe Jalapeno), Curry Laksa and Spicy Udon Noodles are my most favorite entrees. Com Chien is great too and you truly can't go wrong with any of the appetizers. My favorite is the Curry Shrimp but also love the Dumplings/Gyoza (both are excellent), Spicy Crab Rangoon, Edamame Spring Rolls and Mango Summer Roll. You genuinely can't go wrong with CO. I've never been such a big advocate or considered myself a \"regular\" at any restaurant but everything about CO warrants a weekly visit. I've taken all my friends here and they've never been unhappy. Anyone that posts a negative review is simply a negative human that wants to complain. If a mistake is ever made at this restaurant is immediately resolved by the staff. You won't be disappointed!!",

Their food is extremely flavorful, with a good deal of spice, and I'm thrilled they've opened in Charlotte!  We have tried the pork belly buns, pork gyoza, and spinach dumplings.  The buns are pretty good, but a bit messy to eat.  I only wish the pork belly was served a little crispier.  The gyoza dumplings are delicious, especially with their dipping sauce.  I preferred the spinach dumplings more than my husband, simply because of that amazing creamy, lemon sauce.   For our entrees, I usually stick with the pressed salmon and avocado with lemon aioli.  The pieces are big and yes, they are a bit hard to get into my mouth, but that never stops me!  That sushi is literally bursting with flavor.  Each piece has a small, thin slice of lemon on top (rind and all).  I promise, it's not bitter!  The lemon adds the MOST amazing flavor to this sushi.  I'm literally salivating now just thinking of it.    My husband has had their curry laksa, a spicy coconut noodle soup with shredded chicken and shrimp, and beef pho.  The laksa soup is very spicy, and oh, so good!  I always help myself to a few spoonfuls, and keep wanting to go back for more.  He said their beef pho is some of the best he's ever had.  The broth is very fragrant and flavorful.  For beverages, we have tried the cucumber mojitos, but we also love just getting club soda with lime on hot days.  Their mojitos are delish!    Service is always good here.  On our first visit, our server (I wish I knew his name) was truly stellar - there when we needed him, unobtrusive when we didn't.  Even sitting outside on their lovely, shaded patio, service is very attentive.  CO's decor is very modern.  The bar is truly amazing, and sets this place apart from the typical Asian restaurant.  There's not a lot of seating, but we sat near the back, in tables meant for sharing with other parties.  The music they play is sort of edgy lounge music (think Nightmares on Wax), and is very fitting to the atmosphere.    I'm kind of glad we don't live very close to CO.  Otherwise, I'd want to go every weekend for dinner!  It's well worth the trip, though, and I know we'll be back again soon.",

However my issue is with the food. There are some dishes that are great- the sushi has been consistent and I love the poke style bowls that they have introduced. I get the salads there (papaya, Vietnamese chicken, bun xao) they are very tasty. However, I have eaten some noodle dishes that are just over-dressed, over seasoned. The pad Thai was doused in a sweet dressing. The curry laksa was extremely salty ( and I love salty foods don't get me wrong). The drunken noodles are drenched in sauce. If they could dial down on the sauces and seasonings on some of their noodle dishes it would be great. However, it has been such a hit or miss lately that I probably will wait on coming back again.",

While standing at the sink in the bathroom, I watched a waitress walk right out of a stall and back out into the restaurant without even thinking of washing her hands. I'm no germaphobe, but that sincerely grossed me out. Because of that, we opted to sit at the bar with hopes that the bartender washed his hands. The service we received at the bar was really great and they had a great selection of drinks and food, but the beef pho was awful. I didn't even want to finish it because the flavor was so off-putting. The broth had a metallic taste, almost as if it had been stored in a metal container too long. The beef tasted old and was very gamey which turned me off to the dish entirely. I really love pho and Asian fusion. I'm sad we didn't have a better experience.",

We decided to start off with the Spicy Crab Rangoon. They were absolutely delicious! So good that I would return just for those. We also decided to get their Boba Tea but they were out of tapioca pearls. I got thai and my bf got milk - we both agreed that we've had better.  For dinner, I got the Malaysian Chili Wings and the Kung Fu Crunch. Both were so good! My bf hates sushi yet he ended up eating half of mine. He decided to get the Korean Rice Bowl for himself but did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed my food. Either way, I think CO is definitely worth a try.",

My bff and I have decided that we are going to try to visit a new restaurant, (aka new to us), once a month. We started tonight at CO because our slacker selves hadn't exchanged Christmas presents yet. I know, terrible!! I should preface this by saying I love Asian food, minus anything alive or particularly squiggly, I'm into it all and this menu has a bit of everything. I ordered the Orange Blossom cocktail to start while I perused the menu. It was delicious and sneaks up on you while you drink it. I also later tried the pineapple/aperol drink. It wasn't as good. We took a long time to order because we couldn't figure out what to get (we wanted it all), However order we did. To start with I got the spicy crab Rangoon and she got the beef and kimchi dumplings. Both were really good, but be warned the Rangoon comes out molten hot (I burned the roof of my mouth lol). We couldn't decide between sushi and an entree so we decided we would each get both. I went with the pressed spicy tuna roll (good but not mind blowing), and she the caterpillar roll (she said it was good, I don't like eel). Now when it comes to entrees I hands down made the better choice! I went with the Korean rice bowl and it was so, sooo good, seriously the beef was perfectly cooked and all of the veggies were flavorful. The pickled carrots were love!! My bff went with the chicken Katsu banh mi. She liked it, but if I was her I would have had food envy!! Then we got dessert (did I mention we ate way too much food??). One tip, currently if you check in on Yelp you get an offer for a free dessert. We went with the cheesecake wontons, and they were amazing! Four small perfectly portioned wontons with what can only be described as orange blossom cheesecake, and candied orange rinds. I personally was in heaven.   The decor was nice, but not very comfortable. I seriously hate this trend of everyone having just high top tables. I'm short, not graceful, and I can't get in them without looking like an idiot. Luckily by the front window they had regular tables with little square cushion seats without backs. Overall I liked this place a lot... our waitress was nice but REALLY slow on service. You could tell she wasn't into it, I get it it's a Monday. So 4 stars it is, and I think I absolutely would come back for the rangoon, Korean rice bowl and the cheesecake wontons!!",

CO has a proper loungey but yet restaurant vibe making me pumped but relaxed all at once ( How is that possible?). All nestled in the quaint Park Road Shopping Center. Seems like a euphemism if you ask me.  All of which I love! Now onto the important part the food: A very important note: Can I say I applied the special CO sauce to everything I ate and it is amazballs! You must try if you like some spice to your life!!! I ordered the following with the help of my sidekick david: mango spring rolls, tuna poke stack and the crab rangoon dumplings! Each doused in the special sauce made it all the better(meaning spicy deliciousness)! Topped off with the strawberry crispy rolls( no sauce on this one ....sorry :()! Delish!!!

The tofu was cooked very well and we enjoyed the flavoring of the sauces in the fresh veggies. There is a good atmosphere with modern Asian-inspired decor and service was friendly. We will definitely be back!",

They provide an exquisite experience, all the way from the moment you walk in to the time you walk out of the door. They provide exceptional customer service, delectable meals, and a very welcoming atmosphere.  Masterfully designed, the bar stands as the centerpiece to its interior with a great outdoor patio to add to the touch. The bartenders there are warm and welcoming, particularly Mitzi.  She offers exquisite service and always makes sure that customers at the bar and around the bar are taken care of.  I highly recommend this place for even the stingiest of customers and I will definitely be back again soon!",

    "text": "We decided to give CO a try for an early Valentines Day dinner this past Saturday.   When we arrived, there was about an hour wait. So we put our name down and head over to the bar for a drink. The ceiling above the bar is absolutely cool! I love the wood ceiling as a focal point and having the bar in the center. My husband and I both grabbed a glass of wine. The wine list was pretty small but I thought the prices were just right.   After a bit, we started chatting with the hostess (who I believe was the GM). I recognize that his business is sales. However, he thoroughly walked us through his favorites on the menu and was the person that made us want to stay (as we were considering leaving, since the wait was long) to check out the food. Just an awesome person to talk to!   We eventually got seated and I ordered the bourbon blackberry drink. Oh my gosh....this thing was delish!!! Muddled blackberries mixed in so well, flavor wise!   We started with the pork and kimchi dumplings. They were very tasty. A bit spicier then I was expecting but delish! Additionally, we got the pork belly buns, pressed spicy tuna roll, and green chicken curry. The pork belly buns were good. However, I was expecting them to be steamed and they were fried....Im sure I just missed that on the menu. I thought the flavor was really well done. The pressed spicy tuna roll was just a log of deliciousness. I want to try more of their sushi in the future. The green chicken curry stole the show for me. It was a very very nice portion and just crazy flavorful. I may or may not have actually drank some of that sauce from the bowl :)  Overall, I thought the service was fantastic and food very delish! We will be back!",

I did not do a review after our 2nd visit, so I will say the Ahi Poke is also fabulous! I have been happy with every single thing I have ordered in our 3 visits and the only thing my husband wasn't crazy about was the Banh Mi. He felt it was too bready. This is definitely our favorite Asian restaurant outside of Asia!!",

I would recommend all of those items except the spring rolls -- they were a little bland.  Not bad, just not memorable. Side note: they don't take reservations so that's annoying.",

The first visit the wait was bad so I tried it again as take out hoping that my experience would be better not frustrated from the pace of the waitstaff (they seem pretty inexperienced). The staff told me my Vietnamese Ramen and Pork Belly bun would be ready in 35min. I thought this was a bit long but hey at least I am within walking distance. When I arrived the hostess told me to follow her to the bar where she indicated my name to the staff member at the bar register...that girl ignored me :( and told me to wait just a minute when she did acknowledge me. So I waited and had to repeat my name to her and stand awkwardly at the bar for a few minutes. When I got home, 1min walk from restaurant, the bun was just cold and greasy, the pork just not seasoned.. The saving grace was the Vietnamese Ramen, which was good. The place just lacks a cohesive staff and has an awkward layout for staff mobility. Hoping all disappointment is a result from growing pains.",

I've been here twice, both times with my brother (2 different brothers) because they wanted to check it out. I had drunken noodles and pad thai. Both had too much salt. They said their dishes were okay at best. High price is okay for good food and presentation. For example, Good Food on Montford, is pricey but delivers on taste. All 3 of us liked the decor and attentive wait staff but won't be returning any time soon. It's a shame the food quality/taste doesn't match with the ambiance. It wouldn't surprise me if this place closes down within 3 years once the shine wears off.",

Our server greeted us within a decent amount of time but after that we didn't see much of him - he would disappear to the back. We ordered the shanghai chicken wontons and pork belly buns for an app. They were delivered quickly and both were really good. Our entrees, pad Thai and com chien, were also very good but were delivered shortly after we got our appetizers. I had to go to the hostess stand to get an extra set of chopsticks since our server took mine and he didn't come back around for a quite a while.

They have different servers bringing the food, and they don't know the dishes---one server kept asking who had the ramen at our table (nobody), but it was actually pho and I had to point that out to the server.  No water refills.  They're very nice, but poorly trained.  On the food side, the curry laksa is excellent and the pork and crab spring rolls were superb.  Also, the chopsticks they give you are way too small--you get better ones with takeout Chinese.  I'll go back for the food, but if the service doesn't improve, I won't make it a regular place.",

I was in town visiting from Southern CA and we decided to try this place and thought the food was soooo good! I want them to open one in LA! My husband and I went for dinner and ordered a few different things to try - all were hot and tasted so good.  One of my favorites was the Curry Shrimp Appetizer, I could have literally drank a cup of this sauce.  The sushi rolls were great along with their variety of unique cocktails.  We also had the Crispy Cheesecake Wontons for dessert and they were so tasty and something we had never had before.   We were surprised to find out that this restaurant recently had its grand opening! We didn't see signs of that at all.  Our waiter was very attentive to us, food came out quickly and was warm, and over all it was a great experience.    We actually went back for a second time for lunch while we were in Charlotte, this time my husband had the Pad Thai and I got the Hanoi Noodles.  Both were very good, I would highly recommend the Hanoi Noodles with chicken, they are noodles that I think are stir fried in curry sauce - so good! I have never had anything like this in LA and wish I could find a place that has them because I'd like to order it again!",

The Pho, he said he wasn't a fan of the noodles, he ate most of it.  My Korean bowl was very good, and then we had the Cheesecake wontons, very good.  When I got the check they had charged me for a boba tea (we did not order or get) we were charged for Vietnamese Ramen ($14) which didn't make since we didn't order, and the Korean bowl and cheesecake wontons.  They took the boba tea off and argued that we did order the Vietnamese Ramen so we paid for it I gave her $40 for our check that was $33.45, which the change would be $6.55, the bartender/waitress said would you like any change and I said yes $2.00, and she said your change is just $4 and I was tired of arguing so I said, fine keep the change...   I might go back because I loved the food, but I would ask them to repeat the order before they put the order in and also, double check the ticket and also not tip that much for the two big mistakes they made (very disappointed)",

We shared the green papaya salad and fresh summer roll. I would highly recommend both. I had the firecracker and rainbow roll and my wife had curry laksa which were both great as well. Our server Soo was very attentive even though she was also tending the bar. We will definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "Curry Laksa came out lukewarm and way too salty, if you know anything about Asian noodle soup, the broth should always be sizzling hot! That's why the bean spouts, basil and cilantro are put on the side to be \"blanched\" on your own. With that said the Hanoi noodles were good, my husband liked this place for the cool atmosphere and interesting cocktails, mainly for its proximity to our house. As a sucker for authentic Asian cuisine I'm not a fan of paying $15 for a bowl of salty lukewarm noodle soup that I could get elsewhere for $9 and much better prepared.",

I've had my fair share and this was the most bland boba tea drink I've ever had. I couldn't believe I paid for that. I might as well have ordered water.   I was ready to order something I saw someone else got from social media and come to find out then they changed up their menu. So, I settled and ordered another soup noodle dish. I was highly disappointed. I didn't taste a lot of the Asian flavors. The soup was very oily. Proportions weren't good. I had way more noodles than meat. I couldn't even stomach more than 2 bites.   The place is very Americanized in my opinion. Good luck on your experience.",

Ordered California Roll Sushi to start and it took close to 30 mins to come out. Taste was dry as if it was in the fridge, which concerns me since it took so long to come out.  Ordered Drunken Noodle with Chicken which was a tired American take on my favorite thai dish. Drunken Noodle is a dish with spice to it and this was more on the sweet side. No spice at all. The meal was prepared great if it was what it was meant to be.  Service was not up to par to be located in Park Road Shopping Center. Bartender took more than 5 mins to ask me if I wanted to see a menu. He squirted sour mix on me and my phone while preparing a drink and gave a \"ha, did I get you? Sorry.\" and handed me a glob of mostly wet bar napkins.  I wish I would have saved my money and caloric allowance.",

    "text": "Hmmmmmmm, well... I suppose CO is a great spot for \"Asian Fusion\" if you aren't into authentic Asian cuisine. The pricing is a bit much for the experience... $17 at lunch and I'm not quite thrilled.  CO is definitely a mainstream restaurant with flare on the ceiling decor but I personally didn't find any flare in the food choices. I visited with my friend and coworker who is Asian and we are in agreeance that it was OK for taste factor. I ordered the wings , which definitely needed more time marinating in the sauce vs pouring it on top . I couldn't taste anything but the fired chicken flavor . I also ordered the curry shrimp , this was yummy but it wasn't very Asian flavored.   What I did like about CO was the fast, friendly service and the quickness of our food coming out. I think because of the area they will get continuous customers because there isn't anything close to compare it to , but I need more pizzazz to get my flavor tastebuds excited.",

    "text": "A friend and I tried this place on New Year's Day.  This restaurant in part of a regional chain with other locations in Myrtle Beach, Charleston, and Savannah. It sits in Park Road Shopping Center next to the stairs that go down to Sir Edmond Halley's and across the parking lot from McCranie's tobacco shop.  The decor inside is beautiful with portraits of asian women on the walls and this beautiful tree-like structure whose trunk in in the middle of the bar and branches out into the ceiling of the restaurant. The tables are high tops around the sides and front of the restaurant.  The menu consists of sushi, noodle dishes, stir fry dishes, salads, and banh mi sandwiches. They also have a specialty drink menu...a few beer options with only one being local, OMB's Copper.   My friend and I ordered the Pork and ginger gyoza dumplings for an appetizer. The dumplings were good. Dipping them in CO's hot sauce made them killer!   For an entree, I ordered the Curry Laksa which was beautifully presented. However, the description said it included thai basil but the majority of what I saw was cilantro. There were two tiny springs of thai basil that were dried up on the additions plate. Also all the herbs were wilted and not fresh. There was no listing of cilantro in the description of the dish and many people cannot stand cilantro so it should be listed or mentioned if you're going to use it as a substitute.  Also, the dish was listed as spicy but it was not even close. Adding the sliced jalapeno is what made it spicy for me.  So while the dish was beautifully presented, the described flavors came up short.  My friend had the miso ramen but said it was good but it doesn't even compare to another area ramen place.  Service was decent but we were there early when they first opened for the day and it wasn't too busy.     Additionally, as a tall and larger person, I found their seats to be uncomfortable. They may be trendy but I think most larger people will find them uncomfortable. You are probably better asking to be seated at the red bench in the front.  I hope the other options here are better. Perhaps the sushi is what to order here. Either way, I came out a bit disappointed on my visit here so while this is a 3 star review, it's more like a 2.75.",

    "text": "The food is fresh with fresh garnish, herbs and spices. Tuesday and Thursday is half off rolls. And since they have happy hour 4-7 every mon-fri, by combining happy hour (1/2 off select small plates and drinks) with Tuesday and Thursdays you get a great deal.   My main reason for not giving the restaurant 5 stars is deception on the menu. It might not be intentional but it's there.  They list a \"KOBE BEEF\" roll. There are only 9 restaurants in the entire United States authorized to serve Kobe (a specific region of Japan) beef. Example: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F8-restaurants-that-serve-real-kobe-beef-2016-7%238-teppanyaki-ginza-onodera--honolulu-hawaii-8&s=59d60055d2ee481f2a9afb5fd67453c2e646ff320ca6c57f284e610c6698ac93\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">businessinsider.com/8-re...</a>      Wagyu in the US is usually a cross-bred derivative. It's one thing to say you are serving \"US Bred Wagyu\" but to go so far as stating \"KOBE\" is deceptive and misleading. Why lie when your food is delicious anyway? Just list it as \"Wagyu-like beef\"!    I'm a food fanatic who is passionate about food, its cultivation methods, harvesting methods, use of humane slaughtering, etc. I have read many books well beyond my formal education. It pains me when I see restaurants seemingly take advantage (intentional or not) of the average customer's gullibility. Especially when it is not necessary and the food would still taste great.",

Needless to say I am so happy I went.  CO definitely did not disappoint and I definitely see myself returning soon. We started with the tuna tacos, light and fresh, a perfect start to the meal.  Then on to sushi which was my favorite part of the meal. I had the Kung Fu Crunch roll, OMG!  Salmon, Avocado Cream Cheese topped with Spicy Tuna and Tempura Flakes. I could have gotten five of those rolls, so good. Others had the Lemon Roll, which they loved. For entrees we tried a variety of items, including Chicken Pad Thai, Curry and a Beef Rice Bowl. All were amazing. Along with the menu, we received Saki pairings, 3, which was a nice addition. My favorite was a Sparkling Pineapple Sake. The atmosphere is very cool, but service was definitely not 5 stars...but again it was Restaurant Week so I won't fault them for that.  Although my first visit was during Restaurant Week, the service and food was so good I will definitely be a returning customer.",

On my first visit, I was overwhelmed with choices, so I asked a fellow foodie for advice. She suggested the Hanoi noodles...it was spectacular! The prickly pear margarita was exquisite. Too bad it wasn't in the menu this trip! Sometimes I become a creature of habit and order the same dish, but for this visit I ordered the tuna tacos as an appetizer and the Thai green curry with shrimp for my entree. My dinner companion ordered the crab rangoons and curry laksa. The food was amazing and delicious. We even took some home because we couldn't finish. To complete the culinary experience, we each had a carafe of sake!  Some may complain about pricing, but good and cheap don't always go together. The service on both visits was stellar. This time, we ventured here on a lazy Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy. Beautiful atmosphere and decor...very trendy. Our server was funny, helpful and attentive. I'll surely return to eat at CO!!",

I'm a dip my toe in the pool before I jump all in kind of guy).   The space is very cool and modern. The middle of the bar has this wooden-tree like structure that's nice. The service was decent.   To start, I felt the prices were a little high for what it was. Vietnamese food is relatively inexpensive in authentic places, but this is fusion... and we're in Southpark... so there you go. I'm not paying $9 for a Bahn Mi sandwich... not my thing. Sushi was also a little pricey, but they looked good coming out of the kitchen. I asked the server for a recommendation: he mentioned the curry laksa. It wasn't bad... the curry was a little too sweet, but I'm guessing that part of the 'fusion' they are talking about. The bowl was nice size and the noodles were cooked well. Overall I liked the dish. I felt that I need to try a couple of more dishes before I give it my final opinion, so ultimately I would go back again.",

One of the best meals my family and I have had in a while, we usually have to deal with bad food and good service or good food and bad service but not this time.

Take out was ready 25 minutes later than indicated  (1 hour after ordering online) , and order was wrong. Had to wait another 25 minutes after driving back to correct order, and still got order wrong. CO did refund two entrees and an appetizer. Quality of food on take out order was mediocre. Green Thai curry was salted dishwater. Though we like to support businesses close to home, it will be a long time, if ever, before we consider patronizing CO again.",

She recommended the Jam Session beer, so I got one, which was a great recommendation!  Then she gave us some time to enjoy our drinks before coming back to take our order.  I asked what she recommended and she said the Hanoi noodles are her favorite, so I got it.  My friends ordered pad Thai because they're basic and know nothing else to order.  Emily refills our drinks often and is kind and respectful when asking if we need anything at the moment.  Not much time passes before the food arrives and I get to try her recommended Hanoi noodles. She was very right! The noodles were so good, I even crave them now while making this review.   Overall I had a great time at CO, the food is great, the atmosphere is fun, and service is top notch thanks to our server, Emily.",

Both of us loved the gyoza dumplings more than the kimchi/beef dumplings though they are a close second.  We tried a variety of dishes to share -- Sushi favorites --Spider roll & Spicy tuna crunch rolls --both have a savory sauce and nice balance of spicy and sweet in the spider roll. The pork belly buns are heaven in one bite! They have the sweet salty pork, the honeyed dough of the bun and your tastebuds start dancing!!   Also, I love the decor and the urban sophisticated vibe of CO. We came for lunch on a week day so there was no wait. I would like to visit again and try the pho next time. The house made hot sauce was super spicy and fantastic!",

The food wasn't bad, we left a bit hungry. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful though. Especially the wood that comes from the bar and goes across the ceiling. It would be a nice date spot.   If you are in the area and in the mood for a nice asian place, this would be good but in my opinion there are better general dinner options at Park Road Shopping Center.",

A few minutes later we watched them seat a party of two at our potential table. That was frustrating. Then we were seated at a bench with other people. It was very uncomfortable with nowhere to place your belongings like coat or purse. Not super hospitable..... I folded and sat on my coat.  Our waitress was very nice, Aspen was great. She was really accommodating. She should be helping her team mates with customer service. At this point, we are thinking the food had better be amazing.  The food do not disappoint! It was very good. Great seasonings and it came out in a timely manner! The signature CO hot sauce was delicious! Our party tried Hanoi Noodles, curry, sushi, Pho GA, and Bun bo hoi. All were delectable!    If you want a great take on pan Asian food, this is a good place to come if you aren't in a hurry. Be sure to plan for the wait and ask for Aspen as your server.",

Our waitress was very kind but the service was slow-- I be they are simply understaffed. As others have noted, if you get here around 630p you can expect to have to wait probably 45 minutes for a table; also they dont take reservations and the phone number listed here on yelp and on their website doesn't work!  The food: there's a good variety on the menu and the prices are reasonable but not cheap. Since this was restaurant week, they had 1 app + 1 small salad + 1 entree for $20. We had the pad thai and beef pho; both dishes were just so-so. Both of these can be found definitely better elsewhere.   I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars because of the great reviews their other locations had, but its simply not deserving; I wish I could chalk it up to them being new, but I think being open 2-3 months should be enough time to get most of the kinks out. We might come back to give it another shot. This place caters well to the population nearby and fills in a need: an uptown-style restaurant located without the need to drive, a nice bar, and passable food. I think CO will do well.",

I went on a Monday night, thinking it would quieter, but I still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The food was well worth the wait. After ordering, it only look 10 minutes for the food to come out. I got the Curry Laska on the recommendation of our server and it was fantastic! The portion was so large, I took over half of it home. I will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "I heard about this restaurant from a buddy of mine and he raved about how delicious the food was, so I figured making the trip would be well worth my stomach's time.  First of all, the food was awesome! I had both of the taco small plates (pork belly and tuna) as well as an order of the pork belly buns and couldn't have been happier.  I'd have to say, the tuna tacos were off the charts good, but the pork belly tacos were also delicious.  I didn't know whether to get the buns fried or steamed, so my server, Sasha, talked to the kitchen and brought me one of each!  Very accommodating service for a first time patron.  And the house Singapore sauce mixed with a little bit of soy sauce was a phenomenal accompaniment to every single bit of food consumed.  That being said, the most enjoyable part of my visit was the service.  I was waited on by Sasha and she was professional, knowledgeable, and personable.  I was unfamiliar with the cuisine and food, but she led me in the right direction at every turn.  I would have been happy with the food alone, but she tied it all together and made my first experience GREAT!  I will definitely be back and I will try to steer friends and family in the area to this restaurant.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place and now I am so sad because it did not deliver! Sure the atmosphere makes you believe that you aren't in a strip mall, sure the wine list is actually decent, and sure the wait staff is inattentive enough to make you feel like the money you are spending is worth the culinary delight you are about to experience, but is it worth it? No. Last night, I waited at the bar for 40 minutes waiting for a single order of their Vietnamese Ramen. I live less than 5 mins away and so to get home and be disappointed by the food after such a ridiculous wait for RAMEN sucks. All of the ramen noodles were a congealed mass that you had to cut through. The pork belly served did have a good flavor, but for the price of the meal I expected more than 2 small squares of meat. Plus, the menu described the broth as this savory spicy treat and what I got was a buttery- leaning into bland- broth that had no spicy heat at all. I can't imagine Ramen to be that difficult to get right, so for it to be such a disappointment just makes me think how poor the rest of the menu must be. Great job on the interior of the restaurant! Hopefully those swanky, dimmed lights help hide the fact that your food is sub par. The only redeeming quality about this restaurant is the wine list.",

    "text": "Ate here for the first time today. Nice looking place, just a little odd with the long tables and benches in the back where eight people could sit. I sat at one end, with a couple at the other, no problem, but we shared an eight foot bench, just seems like s strange choice. Ordered chicken wontons, which were very good, and chicken shrimp pad Thai, which had been recommended to me by a friend, plus hot tea. The pad Thai was pretty good, but uneven, a large clump of noodles which had stuck together from before cooking, so no sauce mixed into the solid mass. The chicken was nicely done and the shrimp large, overall a nice flavor. However, typically pad Thai has a hot sweet tang to it and this was not quite up to other versions I have eaten (it is one of my favorite dishes). Nicely chopped peanuts, not enough sprouts. Waitress was very nice, service good. I will be back, there were other very interesting looking dishes on the menu, and the place is worth a second look.  Third time here and I now understand the reviews and stars for this place, which didn't seem to live up to my experience. Six days ago I had lunch here, bun bo hue. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had. The broth was reddish and spicy, needed nothing added, was absolutely delicious, and the beef excellent. Stayed on my mind, that's how good it was  So, today after driving back from Asheville, and after thinking about this dish the whole way, I stopped by for dinner and ordered the same dish. How disappointing!!! No reddish tint to the broth, just brown, spicy, but not the previous spicy that enhanced the broth's flavor, just spicy to be spicy. Not nearly enough salt, had to add quite a bit to give the broth some flavor.  From fantastic to very mundane in just two trips. The lack of quality control will be the downfall of this restaurant. Perhaps a new cook not experienced enough?  Extremely disappointed.",

We sent it back and they made it again but the pork was not very good. We were really looking forward to this place but we were so disappointed. The pad Thai was ok can't touch basils pad Thai and futo buta has amazing pork belly buns this didn't taste authentic at all",

Best menu items are Hanoi yellow curry noodles, salmon avocado lemon pressed sushi, tofu buns, beef kimchi dumplings, and the lychee blackberry cooler beverage! Everything tastes amazingly authentic. This is not just your average Asian food restaurant; it's truly a unique dining experience at very reasonable prices!",

Instead, you can purchase an order of fried rice and have white rice, too. Clearly a way to get double the price on already expensive lunch. Nice food, but don't expect to get anything any different than how they put it. Second and last time here.",

GM was notified and he quickly had the chef prepare another bowl.  Second bowl was better but still a big glob of noodles stuck together.  They got to figure out how to resolve that so people can slurp their noodles.  But GM did comp the noodles even though we didn't mention the second batch wasn't much better than the first.  I can see this place becoming a fun night spot.  Hope it works out.  It'll be great for Park Road Shopping Center and the local neighborhood.",

I've had several of the small plates: the pork belly bun was grease on grease.  An already fatty piece of meat shouldn't get a \"bun\" that's deep fried.  Not enjoyable.  The big tree thing in the middle is cool but if you want great Asian food, don't come here. Decent at best.",

We had the pork belly buns again - and they were still greasy, but not as - as well as the crab spring rolls which were very good.  We then had the drunken noodles and hanoi noodles and both were excellent (although the drunken noodles were much spicier than I anticipated).   Service was great and the cocktails were pretty good.  Overall, we will definitely walk back here more regularly!  Glad we gave it another chance!",

The pork belly lacked flavor and I couldn't tell it was pork belly, the bun was deep fried and came out very greasy.  The Banh Mi was good but lacked the explosion of flavors that you would associate with a Banh Mi, strongly marrinated carrots and daikon along with cilantro and jalapenos. The bread was not the usual crunchy baguette you would expect on a Banh Mi sandwich. For half the price I'd go to Le's Sandwich Shop for a great Banh Mi or The Yummi Banh Mi food truck. The green curry with tofu was very good not enough veggies and tofu.  Menu is part Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese.  If you are looking for excellent Vietnamese then you might be better off driving down South Blvd. to Vietnam Grille or Le's for Banh Mi.",
