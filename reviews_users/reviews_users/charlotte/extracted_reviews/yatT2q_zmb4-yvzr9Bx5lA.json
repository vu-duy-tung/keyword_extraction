Right at that sweet spot in the middle. Their wings are also excellent and between both of those, I felt like I was eating back in Buffalo. Chicken Finger sub is also very good and another Buffalo tradition you should try.",

First trip to the Uptown location was not a disappointment.    Spoke with owner Jimmy N and reminiscing about home was fun, but its the food that will bring me back soon. Great location for the Knights games.  I recommend parking down the street, eating at Bisonte and walking over to the game.  BTW, we've tried that same routine three times with Mellow Mushroom and were late because of slow service every time.    The Bisonte classic pizza with pepperoni features crispy, thicker slices of pepperoni that are so much better than the typical used everywhere else.  Try it!",

A Buffalo staple, toasted sub with chicken fingers tossed in your choice of sauce, steak, and cheese .  I was going to get the 6\" and fries but changed my mind and just got the 12\" and it was almost to much food by itself.  Overall very pleased with the food.  I thought it was a little pricey but food seemed worth the little extra in price.  I will be coming back to try the Beef on Weck and of course the \"Buffalo\" style Pizza and Wings.  You can't go wrong with the Stinger but you better be hungry and have a place to take a nap in the afternoon.",

The staff was slow to acknowledge me but like I said, it was late - lunch rush was over and folks were trying to clean up and get ready for dinner.  I ordered the two slice (pepperoni) special and an order of the mild wings... The pizza wasn't what I expected. I was thinking more New York style, thin and on the greasy side. This was a thicker with a bready, chewy crust. The sauce was definitely on the sweet side, tasted more of sugar than tomatoes. The pepperoni flavor was nice but it was these thick, nickel sized slices. Kinda weird.  The wings were nice but too expensive, $7 for six wings? They're f*cking chicken wings people, ridiculous to pay more than a buck per wing. Plus it would be nice if they had some non-Bufalo flavors - garlic,  bbw, etc.  Anyway... Chewy, sweet pizza. Pricey but tasty wings. Lackluster service. Had better and I've had worse but not a place I would go out of my way to visit again.",

    "text": "I've honestly never had \"Buffalo Style\" pizza before, even though I've been to Buffalo several times (I always eat wings or a good beef on weck when I'm in town). So I figured I'd give it a shot. I was very pleasantly surprised! We ordered takeout - a pizza for the family and some wings to see how they compared to wings in Buffalo.  The wings were great - meaty, plenty of buffalo sauce, and good homemade blue cheese. I didn't order the specialty wings, which I probably should have. These didn't really represent what I've eaten in Buffalo very well - more like what we in the South are accustomed to for \"Buffalo\" wings. But they were good nonetheless. Next time, I'll go for specialty wings, though.  The pizza was fantastic - a good departure from what we're used to in Charlotte, from the many  chains, NY style, Neapolitan style, and build-it-yourself pizza joints. We stuck with the basics - pepperoni and Italian sausage. The pepperonis were tiny, but plentiful and flavorful - the kind that curl up while baking (my favorite). I would prefer more finely crumbled Italian sausage, but it was still good. Next time, double pepperoni for me!  Now as far as the crust goes, I'm probably going to commit some sort of blasphemy to Western New Yorkers in my description (so forgive my lack of knowledge about Buffalo-style pizza). And by that, I'd say it's a cross between NYC-style and Chicago-style. The pizzas/slices are large like NYC style, but the crust has a certain fluffiness to it reminiscent of a less-deep Chicago-style deep dish. It kind of gave the best of both worlds. Normally, I wouldn't think this description would be all that appealing if I were reading it, but biting into a slice with that fluffy-in-the-middle, but crisp-on-the-outside crust was very nice in fact. Great flavors, great pizza - my wife and I both enjoyed it thoroughly, and it was nice to have a different type of pizza than we were used to.  I'll most certainly be back. I need to try those specialty wings, as well as give the beef on weck a shot, not to mention that this will be one of our new go-to spots for pizza!",

I have also visited Bisonte's original Matthew location several times and have stated that it's the only Buffalo food joint in the area that gets everything right. The same can be said for the uptown location except that the setup is much different and the menu is slightly smaller.  First, for dine-in, this location is waiter/waitress service unlike the counter service in Matthews. The uptown location used to be a different place (and probably more than one) and sits in the shadows of Johnson and Wales University. Uptown has a nicely decorated small bar and some local beers on tap and in bottles and cans. Don't worry Buffalo people, they have Labattt Blue too.   As I mentioned the menu is smaller; a couple of the subs and the eggplant Parmesan pasta are missing from uptown. Still, the food was good and tasted just like food at the the original one. The char-b-q wings from the pit were amazing. You probably figured it out from the other reviews that Buffalo style pizza is thicker and that is good too. They also have the thinner NY style if you prefer that.  I should also mention that our service was excellent and our orders were perfect. I would have liked to have had a few carrots and celery with the wings but that is not a huge deal.",

When I first order the wings was okay, but what in the hell was those suppose to be hard as twisted garlic sticks. So I was having a hungry headache and decided to give the another try with different menu items... BIG MISTAKE... THIS PLACE JUST NASTY AND DONT KNOW HOW TO COOK AND GOOD TASTING QUALITY FOOD. I order the 6pc boneless wings that comes with fries. I ordered the 18 boneless wings with sweet bbq that is also suppose to come with fries. And I order garlic bread with mozzarella added. So 1st the garlic bread sandwich that had no garlic on it, but slapped a piece of mozzarella between the bread made me puke immediately. It was that bad. I didn't order a cheese sandwich. 2nd I never received my boneless wings, I received 18 flats and drummets with the bone inside. Wings was soggy and spicy, when I requested sweet bbq sauce. No fries came with my order and no celery like advertised on this company website through Doordash. Needless to say I have contacted Doordash in regards to the order being wrong. I will never eat here again. This place need to go get training from other real pizza  restaurants.",

FIRST time we ordered an Antipasto salad(No Olives) and a side of meatballs.  We get back home and there's olives all over the salad(My boyfriend is allergic).  We call and they're unapologetic and say that we didn't specify black or green olives.(seriously!) AND then when we went back to pick up the new salad, they were super delayed and asked where the old one was(seriously!)  Oh I'm sorry, please let me bring back your screw up to give to others(That don't like olives, lol).  SECOND time.  We call and place the order for antipasto no olives, pizza, and a SIDE of meatballs.  Guess what...there's olives in the salad and 1 meatball as the side unlike the time before where there was three!  Not sure why they asked what dressing because nothing came with it.  I'd checked the salad considering  my prior experience and alerted the staff of the olive situation.  The staff was unapologetic, unfriendly and unprofessional.  I most likely won't go back.  My current impression is that it's the type of place where my food would get spit on after this review.  I really do hate being a hater on a place but I can't even give this a third shot.  Sadly this is one of the most convenient places to walk to in my neighborhood, the food is good but now it's not even an option.",

I brought my 12 year old daughter along for the 35 minute drive down from Cornelius. We were surprised by the \"newness\" of the facility. I was expecting a typical pizza joint. It was quite nice. Our waitress was helpful and very pleasant. After telling her about my Buffalo roots, one of the owners stopped by to talk about our hometown. Ultimately, I ordered the small pepperoni pie and a Loganberry, and my daughter ordered mozzarella sticks.   When the food arrived, I immediately noticed that the pepperoni were cooked perfectly. The edges curling up and a a nice burnt edge along the outside. In the words of my daughter, \"This is how pepperoni is supposed to taste!\"  Then the best part... the pizza tasted like I was in Buffalo. The sauce was tangy and the crust tasty. The pepperoni was the way I remember it as a kid. I was really happy that I had finally found the holy grail of pizza in Charlotte. I will now be a regular.",

I had actually not realized it had already opened when I was walking to grab some lunch today.   I walked up to the bar and was greeted immediately by the friendly bartender and the owner was present as well. As I was in a hurry, I just ordered two slices of pepperoni to go. But, while I was waiting, I did take in the Buffalo decor (signed Andre Reed jersey was a great touch) and the fact that a delivery man was hauling in some labatt blue. What a great reminder of home! The slices came out quickly and I assured them that if the slices proved delicious, I would be a regular.   Once I opened the box, the pizza did not disappoint. Nice fluffy and soft dough, great sauce, no lack of cheese and a nice, crisp crust. I am having several friends down from WNY this summer and I will be taking them all to Bisonte to get their thoughts!  I sincerely look forward to many evenings where I'll be able to eat there and wash it down with a nice cold blue light!",

It's a little off he beaten path of what I consider uptown, more on the way to midtown. However, it tastes amazing. The pizza roll ups were good but I probably wouldn't get them again. The slices were delicious. The philly cheese steak was by far my favorite. Also the fries are hand cut and taste so fresh!",

They weren't soggy and had a little crisp to them. Sauce was flavorful. The blue cheese is amazing - lots of fresh blue cheese chunks.  The pepperoni pizza was great! The pepperoni curls up with a little bit of grease inside. In my opinion, the best way to eat pepperoni on a pizza. As a cold pizza lover, I liked the pizza better the next day than hot.   If you like beef on weck, I still think Lebowskis has the best but it's not bad here.   I will be ordering this again! Next time, I want to try one of their speciality crusts like the garlic. It's not an additional cost which is awesome!",

The fiance and I came around 7pm on a weeknight and it wasn't crowded and there was plenty of seating (it's actually a huge space!). We ordered pretty quickly after being seated, but it took at least 30 minutes if not 45 for us to get our food. The wait seemed extraordinarily long considering we had ordered two personal pizzas off the main menu. Everyone around us experienced a similar wait. And no one came by to say, \"sorry for the wait\" or offer an explanation or anything. I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to being a new place, but they have another thriving location and this location had been open a few weeks already by the time we went.  The pizza was cheesy, but overall so-so. The Buffalo-style crust is a thicker type crust, somewhere between NY and Chicago, so that it can hold the weight of all the toppings and cheese. The slices are still flimsy though and don't have that crunchy crust that I like. There were also very few vegetarian options on the menu. I wound up ordering the Veggie Lovers and subbing spinach fir the black olives (I'm not an olive person). The toppings were fine, but nothing with a ton of flavor or texture. I just felt like there wasn't much to this to help it stand out.",

I'm from New Jersey and have lived in upstate New York, so I'm supposed to know what qualifies as \"good\" pizza, right?!   You have the option of choosing from buffalo or NY style and specialty crusts. The Buffalo is ever so slightly thicker than the NY and my go-to style, as well as the butter or Parmesan crust. I have tried the cheese and pepperoni pizza. I'm not usually a big fan of pepperoni, but these pepperonis are smaller than your typical topping and seem to be baked prior to being added to your pizza. I love the crispy aspect that they add!  My boyfriend tried their boneless wings which came with a side of fries. Maybe that's a Buffalo thing?   I'm very happy that this place opened uptown and wish them nothing but success! I just realized that you can sign up for email deals. It would be great if they linked up with Yelp for cash back when you dine there. Also, I would suggest that they send out a coupon to residents in the immediate area to increase local 4th ward support.",

I'm not going to lie- we've gotten pizza, wings, chicken tenders and fries before (all one order) - you know, we gotta be fat kids for life!

Don't you dare ordering anything but the Buffalo Style pizza (they've got NY style, but don't even think about it). Buffalo style is just that good. LOADED with cheese. I'm usually a big proponent of 'specialty' pizzas like Hawaiian, all meat, supreme etc. BUT -- the regular buffalo style pizza with just cheese & pepperoni is my go-to here. The bring in actual buffalo peps, which my wife lovingly calls \"grease cups\". These mini-peps actually curl up and crisp in the oven during baking, so they look like little cups of heaven.  Their wings are also nothing to snub your nose at. Plenty of sauces to pick from compliment these large, meaty wings that are expertly cooked. Pizza is always ready quickly, usually in about 15-20 minutes tops.  The downfall of Bisonte, currently, is all the construction surrounding it. Parking is a PITA due to the street being closed, so my wife and I always order it either take-out (illegally park down at the corner by the Subway) or delivery.",

There is a bar area that is well stocked and a visible sign with drink specials. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful. NOW THE FOOD-it was delicious. No complaints at all. Well I had to get extra sauce for my wings, but that doesn't count lol. The wings were crisp and flavorful, and the pizza was scrumptious! I literally have no complaint about anything here! While everything was delicious, it's pretty weird that my favorite was their blue cheese! It's homemade and it was the best blue cheese of my life!   Parking is a little weird with all of the construction, but it's worth the walk!",

    "text": "I had heard good things about the wings here and had the chance to try them at the Yelp wing fling last year. They were really good, so I knew I needed to try them for real.   We were at Blue Blaze this weekend and Bisonte is conveniently close so a few of us got delivery. It took a little less than an hour on a Friday night for it to arrive which was what they estimated.   Everyone else was in the mood for pizza, but we decided to get both pizza and wings. We got a large buffalo chicken finger pizza and 12 wings -- half sweet chili and half Carolina gold.   Everything was delicious. The pizza was probably my favorite non-Italian style in Charlotte. They have flavored crust too and we got garlic. The wings were probably my second favorite in Charlotte (I love Seoul Food & Meat Co). They grill them and they are a little crispy for the perfect texture. Both sauces we got were delicious.   The large pizza is huge, a small definitely would have been enough for us. I think one person would probably still have leftovers with a small.   I'd highly recommend checking this place out for some great wings and pizza!",

    "text": "Been searching for some good pizza and it's finally been discovered. Bisonte Pizza Co. Wow. I came here after eating a large meal and wasn't even feeling hungry so I knew the pizza was that GREAT and it wasn't my hunger pangs tricking me out. This pepperoni pizza was pure perfection, I had to get another slice before I walked out. It's the right combination of the special dough recipe, the cheese, and the pizza sauce. I also love how they don't overly mass top their pizzas with pepperoni. Not a fan of extra salty/greasy overloaded pepperoni pizzas. I'm sure you could request to place more toppings if that's your fancy, but the dough is what you need to experience here at Bisonte and they surely make it stand out for you with minimal pepperoni pieces. Crispy bite-size pepperoni will have any pizza fan in gratification. Bisonte means buffalo in Italian and this restaurant was opened by two brothers who grew up in Buffalo, NY. Their wings are super big time as well, but if you want to know where to grab some awesome pizza, Bisonte is the place.",

The pizza was delicious! It had just the right ratio of sauce to cheese and toppings. Every bite had just the right amount of cheesy goodness. I highly recommend.   The wings were good too! They were all a good size and bbq was just the right about if sweet and savory.   You guys....They made all the dressings from scratch. I tried the ranch and I could have put it in a cup and drank it. It was so good. I dipped my pizza and the wings. Do yourself a favor and get a dressing on the side.   Everything was good!

They offer pizza, wings, and sandwiches as well as a full bar and some TVs to catch any games you might want.   My husband went for their NY style pizza with pepperoni. I will say, the \"buffalo style\" pepperoni are small little cups, which is different, but still just as tasty. Bisonte also allows you to get flavored crust. We always get the garlic and it's delicious. They have other options as well. The pizza itself is good, with the dough a little bit more on the chewy side. I usually go for their wings, and the medium is the perfect spice level for me. I do wish they came with celery or carrots, but the wings themselves are meaty and cooked perfectly. They also have homemade bleu cheese, which is delicious!   There is one downside (but it's not their fault). Right now they're not the easiest to access because of the construction on trade. As long as your ok with a little walk, you'll be fine. Bisonte also delivers within a certain area of Charlotte, so it pays to call and ask before assuming they will deliver to you.",

I didn't want the commercial pizza places so my husband who frequents Charlotte for work suggested Bisonte Pizza. We ordered the large cheese pizza with the chef salad with ranch. The gentleman on the phone was so pleasant and wanted to make sure we were informed on what to order. He estimated a 45minute delivery but, it arrived to our hotel in about 30 minutes. The 8 slice large pizza was HUGE and enough for the four of us. The chef salad was great and the homemade ranch was perfection. I highly recommend anyone craving pizza in the Charlotte area to order from here!",

This one is in Gateway Village. Skip the parking deck and grab a spot on the street (all full? Make sure to look across the street at the inbound side as well).  Bisonte means buffalo in Italian. There are two styles of pizza crust here: Buffalo (a little thicker) and New York. You can also get free specialty crusts (sesame, cajun, onion, butter, garlic, parmesan). They also do pizza by the slice. My favorite pie here is the Bisonte Classic (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, hot peppers, black olives, Italian sausage, capicola). Such a great combination of toppings. I also love their Steak Bomber (like a philly). The wings are delicious, my friends love the Stinger (steak and chicken fingers sub).   Specials:  MONDAY: $1.00 off any 12\" sub TUESDAY: $3.50 off a large cheese +1 topping pizza WEDNESDAY: $1.00 off any order of pasta  This location is way different than the Matthews one. It's huge. Full bar available. If you're a Bills fan, you'll love this spot.",

Staffing was minimal which might explain why how dirty the place was when I walked in. Most tables were vacant but unusable because they were not cleaned up in a timely manner. I might have walked out, but I was hungry and was a bit tired from a long day at work. My hotel was close by, so I settled in. Ordered the small size, NY style type pepperoni. Tasty, but not exactly NY. Good non-the-less. Overall, I gave it a 3 star, it could have been much better, but it could have been much worse as well. I was just happy that they were open late, even with their major front street all torn up.  You won't be disappointed, especially when you are tired and hungry.",

Although I am not from Buffalo (or Western NY), I have spent a lot of time there on business.  I became a Bills fans after Jerry Butler (Clemson) sort of befriended me (long story) when I helped my dad at his ice cream store in Clemson on weekends as a young kid.  Anyway... Bisonte....  I have eaten at all the \"hot spots\" in the Buffalo area and I can tell you the wings here are L-E-G-I-T.  Crisp on the outside and hot, steamy and flavorful on the inside.  Good size too.    Pizza - we got it \"Buffalo Style\"... a little thicker crust.  We will get it \"New York Style\" next time to compare.  We got pepperoni and they use those nickel sized pepperonis that cup up when you cook them.  Fantastic.  Fries - I saw that had fresh cut and I am a real sucker for those.  They were excellent.  Blue Cheese - had to edit my review as I forgot to mention the Blue Cheese.  Oh My God... the Blue Cheese.  Homemade and out of this world good.  We didn't get celery with our wings.  I wonder of they don't offer celery???  Beef On Weck - We did not get (see heart attack waiting to happen meal choices above).  But, this is a western NY specialty and I look forward to giving it a try next trip.  Anyone know if they are a \"Bills Bar\" on NFL Sundays?  Service - excellent.  She was very friendly and attentive.    HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place.",

We came in as a group of seven and enjoyed a large pepperoni pizza, two orders of fresh cute fries and a \"triple\" order of wings with honey mustard and bourbon BBQ.   The wings stood out to me. They were cooked perfectly with a bit of a sear on them and the sauce was evenly coated. The blue cheese is made in-house and is quite tasty (I normally don't touch blue cheese but always agree to try if it is homemade!). The ranch was also a nice accompaniment to the wings and I definitely preferred the BBQ style.   The cheese on the pizza was ooey-gooey melted perfection, I just wish it came out well-done as ordered. The pepperoni could've been more abundant as well. The crust however was chewy and delicious but not too thick. I'd definitely order again!  The fries were fresh cut and steaming hot. A little too greasy for my preference and could've been seasoned more.    I'm removing a star for the flaws in execution mentioned above. It's nice to have some decent pizza outside of the NY/NJ area!",

    "text": "You have pizza and wings?  Can we be best friends forever?  Bisonte Pizza, I apologize, you were not in my radar until recently, but considering I do not venture into the gateway area of Uptown as much... it's totally my fault.  Came here after a fun evening with a large group.  We just needed food in our bellies to soak up all the champagne and wine we had be partaking and pizza sounded like a great means to an end.  It was a weeknight (Thursday)... so not very busy... we sat at the long communal table, however this place has plenty of other tables and even another section (maybe to rent out for parties?).  TVs lined the walls so a good sports watching venue as well.  Server was super nice and patient as we were a large group and she was super accommodating.  We ended up splitting pizza and wings between the 7 of us and it hit the spot.  Their wings were especially notable cause of the char on the tips and then the glaze was just the right amount.. not too soggy and not too dry.  The pizza was solidI will have to come back  Probably the one ding is that the parking deck... we may have not gotten the memo on validation or anything, but it seemed like a pain - maybe because we lost our ticket and we ended up paying the max $14 for the day parking.  I believe this is plenty of street parking... probably metered, but my mind was clearly on the food for the evening so I think that's the only ding I would give them with this location, but everything else was excellent.",

    "text": "Good pizza, but was slow getting to the table. That might be because of it only being open a few days. The place is super loud and makes it hard to have a conversation without screaming. Also a few hiccups on table condiment and missing marinara with my friends cheese sticks..   Prices are from reasonable to ouch!!! Depending on what you are getting.",
