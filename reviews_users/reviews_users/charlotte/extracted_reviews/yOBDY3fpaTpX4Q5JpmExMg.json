The salsas, served in tiny bowls, we're tasteless, watery, and boring. A couple we're hot, but that's it. Mains were embarrassing -- meaning we were embarrassed for the cooks. Doughy and wet, filled with dry chopped chicken. Beef filling was the same in another dish. It all tasted old. Rice (dry and crunchy) and beans (watery), were awful. We left most of our food on the table and got out of there. We all felt ripped off.  We'll keep searching for a really good Latin food restaurant. So far, no luck. As for this place, don't waste your time.",

Everyone at the counter is as pleasant can be and will always greet you.  Chips and multiple salsas are brought out to you when you arrive. The wet burritos are about the size of a football and are damn good.  Its like 2 meals for $6. The tacos ( especially the al pastor) and solid and come with extra sides.  For the price point this place is bomb",

You know tacos, enchiladas, burritos, but I tried a sample of tongue (delicious!) and next time I may try the intestines (crunchy). They give you four different hot sauces with chips and Heinikens were only $3.50! The waitresses are very friendly and knowledgeable and willing to let you try before you buy. The only downside is the location, a nondescript stripmall on South Blvd. just north of Sharon Lakes. It's been here 23 years and there's a good reason.",

I currently smell like I was fried in a basket of chips...so...sounds about right.  The positives:  Nice beef burrito, good tasting tomale, English/Spanish barrier (a good thing in my book), the smell of the place, the decor, and how busy it was.  The negatives:  The cheese enchilada, the salsas, the chips were not fresh, and the enchilada sauce is from a bag or can.  Sounds like alot of positives AND negatives huh?  Overall it's good.  This is what Mexican food is supposed to taste like.  Just like real New York pizza is not going to the be the best you've ever eaten.  It is what it is.  I'd definitely go back to Taqueria again.    I think I'm going to have to test drive their Carnitas or Menudo before I decide to add another star...but I'll be back.",

I'd say it's the best authentic mexican food in town, hands down.   The chile relleno is one of the best I've had anywhere. I also LOVE their huevos rancheros and huevos a la mexicana. So delicious!  Chips and salsa is plentiful, including a spicy and amazing tomatillo salsa. They also have a fire roasted smoked salsa, with a lot of heat and flavor (though, truth be told, I'm not a fan of smoked anything, so I stick with the salsa verde and the traditional tomato salsa).  Friendly staff, delicious home-made food. Really, you can't go wrong with anything here!!!",

Their chile rojo is pretty good, it's also really spicy so if you can't take heat I'd stay away from that. Their chile verde is okay. I had their chile rojo wet burrito and it was pretty good as well. I was hesitant after reading all the mixed reviews but decided to give them a try. Just as everyone else says, don't be fooled by the location of the place. It's in a small strip mall and you can possibly miss it but overall it's good.

The restaurant is in a small strip mall, and has a small authentic vibe. The two waitresses were very nice, and took our drink order immediately. I got the wet chicken burrito, and my boyfriend got 3 tacos and guacamole. Just as a tip, the guac is basic without any tomatoes, onions, or peppers in it, but still very good. The wet burrito has amazing, I only ate about half and was full. My boyfriend enjoyed his tacos very much. The prices cannot be beat either! The only grip I have is after the waitress took our plates away, she didn't bring the check or instruct us how to pay. We sat there for about 10 minutes then finally asked about it, and you have to go to the register at the front to get your check and pay. Not a huge deal, just would have been nice to be told that.

Inside is relatively small but they make good use of the space.  The booths and tables are very colorful which helps brighten an otherwise boring decor.  I was greeted immediately and it's seat yourself here.  Once you are seated, someone comes with the complimentary chips and salsa.  As others have mentioned, their red salsa is quite watery and it is very mild.  The tomatillo salsa has a little kick to it.  The chips were decent.  I ordered the wet spinach burrito which was huge and filled with beans, rice, cheese, spinach and onions and covered with a red sauce.  It was ok.  Everything was a bit watery and the biggest flavor here was onion.  I am not sure if was the best introduction to the food here but I have recently been changing my diet and gave up meat for a while.  Perhaps there are better vegetarian items here or possibly a fish dish?  Anyway, the staff was very friendly here and food came out fast as it does with most Mexican places.",

Extra plus in my book.   The portions must have changed too. Like I mentioned, they were good sized and I left with a too-full belly. The veggie burrito was huge and around $5...for dinner! The salsas were good, chips fresh, and I really liked the individual salsa cups with a mini jar to pour your own.   I really liked the bright colors and the art on the booths; it made the ambiance cheerful. The service was very friendly too. Need to catch up on a novela? It's playing in the corner. If you are in need of some chicle, you're in luck, they have that at the cash register. Tip: No rush to pay, just go to the register when you're ready.   What a difference a year makes! I think this place has turned things around and I plan to return.",

    "text": "After six years+ in Houston, we never expected to find muy authentico Mexican in a white bread town like Charlotte.  Fresh fresh fresh.  Not for those who only eat fancy ersatz Mexican, all gussied up for gringos.  This is the real thing.   Try to tacos - fresh, honest, with onions, cilantro and lime.  The salsas - we haven't found anything close since we left Charlotte.  Always three different kinds, each made fresh and served so you can mix and match.  The enchiladas con salsa verde are amazing.  The tomatillo sauce is prepared so you can taste the citrusy tomatillos, not just the heat.  My husband tells me the margaritas are killer - I stick to Corona Light and drive.  We discovered the place many years ago, when it was a hole in the wall in the same location.  Since then, the owners have changed the decor, bright bright colors on the tables and chairs.  Optical illusion prints.  Mexican soaps and soccer on the tvs.  Each year we see more and more gringos, but the local Hispanic community is always there in force.  Can't say enough about this truly family, muy authentico taqueria.  We've moved to Memphis now and while this city is awash in great eats, not one Mexican restaurant comes close.  If you're in Charlotte and know real Mexican food, stop by.  You'll be welcomed, well fed and be reminded of wherever you're from that taught you about real Mexican food.",

Simple tacos on small fresh made soft tortilla, chicken, onions and lime. Add fresh cilantro and you are in food heaven. How much does it cost? Mind blowing $1.75 per taco. The servers are very friendly. The complimentary chips and salsa is too good. Today we tried sopes... Mmmmmm goodness!! Their wet burrito are super too.

First of all, let me say that you would never guess that such a beautifully done interior existed based upon it's nondescript facade. The booths are hand carved and beautifully painted. More importantly, they are comfortable. The service that we experienced was exemplary... both friendly and attentive.  We shared the wet burrito and several authentic tacos which means your meat, onions and cilantro only, on a soft flour tortilla. Everything was delicious and servings were enormous. Chips and salsa were very good too. Pricing is normal but you get a lot for your money.  Most Charlotte Mexican restaurants serve the same generic fare and and most are pretty good; however, this is the only one so far that I give a Gotta Try.",

As soon as we walked in, what seemed to be one of the two owners mentioned in previous reviews sat us at a booth amidst large crowds of other patrons. Then we wait... and wait... and wait. It literally took us flagging down our hostess to get drinks, chips, and salsa. We received our drinks and two salsas, a red and a verde. Ten minutes later, we ordered. Two of us got a wet burrito. One with beef and another with chorizo, served with rice and beans. One got the carnitas. Cue the 45 minute wait for our food (the party of 15 behind us didn't help, I'm understanding). So we get our plates and the \"wet burrito\" is sitting in a grease flavored red liquid... don't recommend. Carnita pork slab was DRY. The rice was hardly authentic, I'm talking like plain Jane rice. So much for my hopes and dreams of delicious Mexican food",

Salsa doesn't HAVE to be chunky so long as you dip a chip and can scoop it up. Salsa was so runny, it just made your chip soggy and never stayed on the chip. Think of the watery watercolor of salsas and you'll get my point.   My husband ordered a shrimp cocktail and never got a spoon to eat it. I ordered the Barbacoa plate (the special on Saturdays) and never got tortillas, cilantro, onion or lime. Barbacoa was served wet but meat was dry and chewy, instead of tender and juicy. It tasted old or reheated.  Beans were not flavorful, and something was off on them and couldn't eat them. I love beans and it takes a lot to put me off of them. The rice was bland. We didn't eat our food, we left it on the table, that's how not palatable it was!! Disappointed. NEVER Visit again.",

It was definitely real Mexican food. Our waitress was cool but there was one lady who looked evil and kept staring at us wanting us to leave right after we ate. We were chatting after a wonderful dinner and she just kept giving us that evil look.. So I went up to pay and she still kept staring so we just ended up leaving. I would def go back again cause the food was that good. But the lady needs to lose her attitude or she will lose customers.   I'm giving it a 3 because of the lady's attitude. She was very rude and not polite at all.",

The tacos were relatively simple mostly just the meat plus a little onion and cilantro (which was a nice addition).  The pork taco was definitely on the drier side and wasn't that great.  It almost tasted like pork I would have in the fridge for two or three days.  The al pastor and chorizo were both tasty.  It was $1.99/taco which I thought was fair.  As with any legit mexican place, you get a basket of chips which came with green and red salsa.  Both were fantastic!    Decor - 4.5/5 - This place isn't fancy, but it's colorful and fun and I enjoyed it.  Couple of TVs were a nice and unobtrusive addition.  Service - 3/5 - On the slower side, but very friendly.  I would come here again, but with so many other places on South Blvd., it'll probably be awhile.",

It appears the ownership has changed and the standards have gone with it. The tacos Al pastor are now more Americanized, the chicken tacos were very bland, the pico they used to have has been replaced with some bland salsa you might find at a shopping center Mexican restaurant.   There are now two guys in the kitchen who had some vulgar conversations, and the whole feel of the place has changed. The tacos are still decent, but the lack of attention to detail has dropped them off the top of my list. I will now put tacos la hidalguense on Little Rock in the #1 spot, but it's technically a taco cart.  It's really a shame. I've probably eaten here 50-75 times over the last 6 years. I am the Duke of this place, by far. We may not be back of changes aren't made.",

It's authentic Mexican food and drinks with huge pints of beer for $7!   Everything cheap or fairly priced with agua frescas of mango, guava, etc. for only $2.25! They are served in huge cups as well. Well worth the price.   On tuesdays, select tacos go from $1.99 to $1 with a purchase of ANY drink. SO CHEAP! My meal with a drink was only $6.25 with 4 whole tacos. I couldn't finish my drink or my last taco so we got them to go.  This place is great with awesome decor and great servers who check up on you and give you more chips and salsa. I'd recommend this place to anyone nearby charlotte. It's a great deal!",

There was a man outside. He greeted us and held the door open for us. When we walked in, we were greeted by a hostess and she told us to sit wherever we would like.   Inside is fairly small. All of the chairs and booths are beautifully decorated with animals and flowers on them. There are two TVs--on opposite walls. There's a small bar at the front. Strings of little lights decorate the ceiling.   Our waitress came over with menus and chips with green and red salsa. We ordered the queso with chorizo as our appetizer. My boyfriend ordered chicken, shrimp, and steak fajitas. I ordered two shrimp tacos. The food came out promptly and it was delicious! My boyfriend said his food was perfectly cooked. The waitress came over often to check on us and she was extremely nice.    I'm assuming the man who was outside is the owner. He came over to our table and asked how the meal was--what a great touch.   I'll definitely be back if I'm in town!",

We were immediately brought two salsas. The red was pretty watery and mild and the green was a tad spicy. I ordered the combo with two hard shell tacos and an enchilada. The taco shells were way too crunchy. Like, one bite and they fell apart. However, the meat inside was very good. The enchiladas were tasty. My husband got a few tacos and some tamales. The tamales were definitely the winner at the table!   Overall, cute spot for a quick bite to eat.",

We did a Yelp search and this restaurant popped up. We wanted authentic Mexican food and this place was it.   I parked in front of the main doors. We walked in and immediately got a booth.   We hadn't seen one another in years. We started chatting up a storm. We got nacho chips or salsa and this spicy green sauce that was amazing!  Our server came back with our drinks. I had ordered a Diet Coke. I went ahead and ordered the beef burrito, chicken enchilada, and pork tanale meal. It came with rice and beans.   My meal was incredible. The food was flavourful. There was a lot of it. I got encouragement from one of my friends to polish everything. I don't have tamales often. I'm glad I got one! I also have a weakness for refried beans. So yummy!  I'd highly recommend coming here. The only minor detail preventing a perfect rating was service. We had asked for the bill and it took fifteen minutes to get it. The restaurant wasn't busy. It was minor for us, as we had plenty to talk about. However, if you are in a rush, you may want to go up to the don't and get someone's attention.   (129)",

When we sat down (seat yourself) we were immediately greeted with a fresh basket of chips and salsa. Green and red salsas, basic but yummy. For lunch I had a delicious and rich, cinnamon horchata and chicken wet burrito and my friend had the fish. We shared churros for dessert. My burrito was delicious and huge, very fulfilling. I preferred shredded chicken but I don't think that was an option here. His fish scared me because it was an actual fish lol but he said it was fresh and tasteful and was served with a large plate of rice and beans. The churros came in a serving of 6 and were served warm with chocolate drizzle on them.   The waitress was friendly, the food came quick and it was delicious. I enjoyed this place and will definitely try to come back one day.   Note: originally I was hoping they had more of a lunch menu, but to be honest the prices are pretty cheap in the first place a lunch menu isn't really necessary. My huge burrito was only $8 anyways.",

I don't know the cuisine but I know good food and this was it; soup was especially flavorful.  This time I tried the MX which I know more about, and was impressed with the quality of their beef in the enchiladas and tacos.  Tacos had an interesting toasty consistency but did not break when eaten.  Basic foods done REALLY well!  Others had shrimp, and when they say garlic, they mean it...in a good way!  Excellent quality, full of flavor.  My only suggestion...whoever was making the Margaritas went WAY light on the tequila; even the top shelf version.  All four at the table agreed.  We did not complain but wanted to add this comment so next time you will earn a 5th star!  And there WILL be a next visit!",

The first place we wanted to go was closed for Memorial day so this was technically our second choice. When we pulled up, there was plywood on the door where the glass had been broken. That almost deterred us looking super sketch, but we decided to try it anyway.  First, we ordered a strawberry margarita and it was HUGE and also delicious. We ended up sharing it because it was so much! The chips and salsa kept coming while we waited for our food. I ordered a burrito which was jam packed with meat, rice, beans and avocado and Hubs ordered fajitas. He had so much meat, peppers and onions, it looked like a double order. The owner even came over and introduced himself and told us a little about the place before we left. Definitely worth the money and getting past the sketchy exterior!",

We came in contact with three different girls throughout our time there but they were all so wonderful and always smiling. I love the interior decor and atmosphere with all the colorful furniture and fun music. The chips and salsa were plentiful and i enjoyed both the red and green salsas. The chips came out fresh and hot, but could've used more salt in my opinion. I ordered chicken fajitas and my boyfriend had the beef enchilada ranchero. The chicken fajitas were so hot and steamy and came with so much food! They gave two tortillas for way tooo much stuffing. Luckily, I didn't finish it all and have more tortillas at home for leftovers. My boyfriend cleaned his whole plate and said his food was tasty. He didn't want beans so they gave him a double portion of rice which was super nice. I would come back for sure. It's such a little gem of a place!",

    "text": "For our monthly girls dinner, my (pregnant and Mexican food loving) friend picked this spot. She has an affinity for off-the-beaten path places and we were down to try something new. Overall, I'm glad we did.   I ordered a shrimp quesadilla. Two of my friends ordered different types of tacos and my other friend ordered the nachos. Our food came out as it was done so it was fresh. My quesadilla was really good - it was full of cheese and shrimp. I added some fresh squeezed lime and hot sauce, which made it even better. My only critique would be that I wish there had been some fresh vegetables in the quesadilla. Also, it is worth noting that the quesadilla doesn't come with sides. That's not a complaint but worth noting before you order.  My friends who ordered the tacos raved about how good they were. So good that my friend (who didn't really like her nachos) and I decided to get some for ourselves.  We did have a few issues with service (my friend ordered two tacos but they only brought her one, our check was not split correctly, my friend had to ask a few times for an item that she ordered) but, honestly, I think it was more indicative of a language barrier than poor service.   If you are wanting some authentic Mexican food, I would recommend this spot.",

They are really friendly here, laid back, the service is fast, and most of all - the food is awesome.  Love the various salsa dips they serve with the tortilla chips.  There are some vegetarian options on their menu.  My favorite is the spinach wet burrito.  One unusual thing in this restaurant that I like is the wash sink that is outside the bathrooms.  It makes it hassle free to wash your hands.  I wish they had an outdoor patio, but in its current location that probably wouldn't work.",

I started eating here about '92, and back then it was frequent I was the only English-speaking person in the place, and the wait-staff were Spanish-speaking only.  The Decor was terrible, but the food terrific. They've changed it all immensely, and now there's always a good mix of American and Hispanic customers.  The food quality is always, 100% fresh and exceptional, and while the Wait-staff is seldom overly friendly, they're always polite. Back in '98 I had the chance to eat at Tacqueria Mexico for dinner one night, got on a plane the next day to Arizona, and late that day was eating on the top of a mountain in Puerta Penasco, Mexico.  I can say with authority the food tasted exactly the same! So, if you're interested in truly authentic Mexican in Charlotte, you owe it to yourself to try this place! As mentioned by other reviewers, it's nothing special to look at, but it's what's inside that counts!",

But the flavors seem hurried, not thought out - ranchero sauce is canned, diced tomatoes, little else - salsa verde lacks the tangy umph that is oh so important. Portions are surprisingly small for the money.   Like a number of taquerias along South, it seems this place is shooting for authentic Mex, and only achieving above-average Tex Mex. Burritos are good, but small, and smothered in what seems to be pureed ancho chili, yet somehow not spicy. I won't be trekking across town for a tiny plate of overpriced, under sauced chilaquiles again, but would come here if I was suffering such a craving for 'ritos that I couldn't stand a 15 minute drive.",

The two times we went, there were other tables in there, so according to that and the other reviews here, fans do exist but don't count me in.  I mean, it was not the worst but that's about all I can say.   The prices are not that big but neither are the portions.   The overall taste, was about three stars says A-OK. Price was on par with portion-minimal, so three stars. Decor, was about three stars only cause I like the colorful tables but the dirt and dust and cobwebs we observed knocked it down. Service was?

    "text": "We had moved from California two months earlier and were craving an authentic Mexican food experience.  Upon pulling into the parking lot, we had high hopes based on the location - we're convinced that the tastiness of Mexican food is directly correlated to the dodginess of its location.  Taqueria Mexico is located in an ugly little strip mall where the biggest store sells auto parts - PERFECT.  Sadly, the location belied the actual food experience.  My husband had the wet deluxe burrito; since I'm pregnant, I had to forgo my favorite huevos rancheros for a mushroom quesadilla.  I also ordered a side of rice and beans to share with our toddler, since for some reason that particular quesadilla did not come with it (other quesadillas did, though).  My husband doesn't talk too much about his food, but 95 percent of the time whatever he is eating is \"AMAZING.\"  I have literally never seen him dislike Mexican food, and we've been to a great number of taquerias together.  Burritos are either \"amazing\" or \"that was the best burrito I've ever had.\"  He declared his burrito here \"not that great.\"  I'll be a little more descriptive about my quesadilla.  It was terrible.  The mushrooms were canned, and I absolutely hate canned mushrooms.  You really can tell, people.  The cheese - I don't even know if it actually had cheese.  The \"cheese\" filling had the texture of watered-down sour cream and did not act like any cheese I've seen, ever.  There was what was supposed to be guacamole on the side, and I really do not think it was guacamole.  It was almost translucent, and bore no resemblance to any guac I have ever seen.  It did not taste at all like avocado.  The beans were refried, and they were so intensely salty I didn't even want my kid to eat them.  Luckily he didn't like them.  After reading all the good reviews I was surprised to have such a bad meal here.  Maybe it was an off day, or maybe our expectations are just too high after so much amazing California Mexican food.  We're hoping to find a good equivalent someday, but will keep looking.",

It isn't fancy, they didn't waste a bunch of money on making it look pretty, they just cook great food, everyday.    I recommend the carnitas, either the plain or the red or the green.  Beware on the red however, it is spicy, it will creep up on you, it is basically their pork tips slow simmered in a spicy chipotle sauce.  They serve it with either corn or flour tortillas, with rice and beans and all the good stuff to make little tacos out of your platter.  I read on here that their portions aren't big.  Which is True, they are a normal size portion, which is smart, generally there is a lot of wasted rice and beans at a restaurant like this.  Personally I love the portion size, it is just enough to fill me and I don't feel stuffed like a relleno afterwards.  The burritos area great, but it's a burrito, you can get that anywhere, try something different when you are at an authentic place.  As for the bar, not too many options, but I'm usually busy drinking salsa at this place.  Just phenomenal.  It's that place where I can look at my wife and say \"I'm craving...\" and she will answer \"Taqueria.\"  Try it, if you don't like it you should probably stick to On the Border, or another pre-processed gringo-safe TexMex restaurant.

    "text": "I'm not sure how two years have passed without this place appearing on the work lunch radar, but better late than never, I suppose.   Located in the O'Reilly Auto Parts strip mall just north of Arrowood on South Blvd, the Taqueria is as bright inside as it is uninspiring and, well, strip mall-y on the outside. That brightness comes from the paint job on the booths and table & chairs, representing all the (particularly loud) shades of the rainbow. Cynics could say it cheapens the look of the place but, c'mon, you're in a super affordable taco joint! Have fun with it.   I will say, though, that one set of chairs has a giraffe and elephant painted on the back, and both of those animals stared at me the whole time I was eating. A little freaky because they're hanging out on the wrong continent and all. Also, a Mexican Star Search-esque show was on the TV; not my personal first (or second) choice, but it honestly enhanced the \"little neighborhood shop\" feel.   I paid $6 for lunch, including my tip, and thought it was terrific. I had two tacos - one chorizo and one spicy pork - both with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Note, as they state on the menu, that those extra three toppings cost $0.50 per taco. I'm guessing if you get them without you just get lime and cilantro. For me, it was worth the try.   Both versions of the taco had meat had a fine-chop consistency - not ground, but still far smaller pieces than chopped BBQ pork shoulder, if that makes any sense. You get a choice of corn or flour tortillas, and I took the latter. They double-up on the corn ones to prevent the always depressing breakage.   Both the chorizo and spicy pork had a great mix of spice and were both bright and savory. I probably could've had a third but the free, warm nacho chips were were a good way to start (and finish) the meal.   They provide three salsas, and the one served in the largest amount (a carafe!) offered the only disappointment for the meal. It had cilantro and garlic pieces in it, but this stuff tasted like straight tomato juice. Perhaps I was doing it wrong, but trying it straight was not good at all. I hope it was just a bad batch lacking flavor, but heed this warning to avoid applying the red salsa to your food before trying a small sample.   Mixing it with the other two options provided a good topping for both my chips and tacos. There was a green salsa - far spicier than your common salsa verde - and a burnt orange one that was a little smokey and spicy, though less of both than you'd expect from a chipotle salsa.   In all, I am happy to have found a place that has fast, friendly service, unpretentious decor, and a menu with enough variety to allow me to try something new (and probably delicious) for a dozen more visits. With 10+ taco options, another 10 burritos, and a number of other plates I didn't take a lot of time to read for a lunch order, this place won't disappoint anyone in the mood for authentic Mexican food.",

    "text": "I can't even believe this is the same place we are all reviewing. I went last Thursday with my co-workers and was promised authentic, cheap, hole-in the wall in all its glory Mexican food.  While I will say the decor and weight staff seemed authentic - the food tasted horrible.  We were given three salsas. The first was a bit too spicy for my taste ( I am a solid medium fan) , the second was normal salsa but nothing to rave about, and the third tasted like my co-worker said  \"a Bloody Mary on my chip\" basically entirely too watery.   I ordered a beef Chimichanga. Now a Chimichanga should be crispy as it is fried but this fell flat- it tasted like it was reheated in a microwave! The meat itself was scary looking (wasnt ground-or really shredded either just gross chunks ...yucky). 7 out of 8 of us made comments about the scary looking meat that filled our various Mexican entrees. I was told the chicken tasted like Chinese food -take that as you will. The rice and beans were the one part I did enjoy.  Overall my meal was $10 - and yucky. I will not be going back.",

Be careful if you don't like it hot, but if you do, you won't be disappointed. A very pleasant place and highly recommended!",

My friend raves about this place and its not one I would go back to. Not sure if it was an off day or what, the resturant was not busy... our server never came back after the food came out... we had to go find somebody to give us the check.",

    "text": "Taqueria Mexico is a refreshing little spot out South Boulevard serving up authentic, homey Mexican cuisine. We were pleasantly surprised with the trio of salsas, including a tasty green tomatillo along with as many chips as you can handle. The tacos are a real standout here, especially the shrimp taco. The wet burrito was very good as well, with a piquant sauce and melted cheese giving it that extra touch. The menu here is huge and I look forward to returning. The prices are also very reasonable and I'm sure the larger dishes would be enough for 2 to share. I am still on the lookout for additional great Mexican spots in Charlotte, but I'm glad to have added Taqueria Mexico to my regular rotation!",

The food is great and the prices are great.  Their salsas are fantastic, traditional mexican salsas  as good as any in LA, warning they are a little hot on the hot side, my husband loves them,  I always asked for mild and that is about the most heat I can handle. My only complaint is that their margaritas are weak, they need to work on them.",

    "text": "I love this place!  Don't let the dinky strip-mall locale scare you off.  Waiting inside for you are delicious burritos, tacos, salsas and everything in between.  A friend brought me here once and I would come here twice a week if it weren't so far from my home.  Instead, it has become something to look forward to, which is just fine by me.  Yes, it's the kind of place worthy of a special trip.  My favorite is the \"wet\" chorizo burrito and the little asada tacos.  Very authentic and totally yummers.  Service is always prompt and friendly, and they also serve three different salsas with their chips, giving a good variety between people who love spicy salsa and people (wussies) who can't handle too much heat (like me).    Definitely try this place.",
