    "text": "I am a pretty big fan of southeast asian food these days, so its nice to finally start finding more legit places in Charlotte.  I havn't been to Ben Thanh yet, so please excuse my ignorance for now.  Outside of the asian mall, this is where its at.  It ain't the prettiest thing from the outside, but Waaaaay more for real, than Pho real.  The broth is spot on.  First time I went was for lunch after a very late evening.  The absolute perfect hangover food.  And i havn't really strayed from the dish yet.  The pho has worked every time.  If these guys had Banh mi, I'd make it a weekly adventure.  Plan to start working on the rest of the menu soon, will update asap.  Word on the street is BYOB?  Havn't tried yet, but that could get interesting.",

(2018) Having had Pho at other places in South Charlotte, I can say this place is the best.    I tried a traditional dish and found the shrimp overcooked (odd, because the shrimp in vermicelli or pho is done just right) and the rice was fair - I suspect this was a one time thing.   There's some vegetarian rolls there, has mint, tofu, with a dipping sauce - it's outstanding.    Their tofu is the best my wife's had anywhere.  My go-to place for Vietnamese food.",

When I arrived the place was quite busy but I was seated at a single table way in the back (ok well its not a very big place so it wasn't that far of a walk).  The menu had a good variety of options and had descriptions underneath the items so you weren't at a total loss.  I ordered my old standby for Vietnamese places, Pho Ga.  I sweat the food was out in 5 minutes. I didn't even have time to sip my water (which is served with lime and is a nice touch).    The aroma of the soup is what caught me.  I want to say it smelled like a touch of cinnamon but I could be way off.  I just wanted to sit there and get high on the aroma for a while.  Finally i decided to season my soup with basil, lime, Siracha, Hoisson and Chili sauce.  Nothing like some spice to clear out the sinuses!  The soup was flavorful and I wanted to savor every drop.  The chicken was tender as well.  I think the aroma of the soup is better here but I'm still partial to Saigon Palace for the service (and the fact that they remember me there) but this is a good solid 4 stars and definitely worth a return trip!",

One glaring hole in the menu is that they do not offer Banh mi sandwiches, which should now be standard at vietnamese restaurants.   Pros:  -Service is fast.  -Servers are accurate and friendly.  They seem to have the menu memorized by number. -Food is excellent and inexpensive.  Cons:    -Building is small.  When busy there might be a wait. -Parking is a bit of a hassle on South Blvd.  Ordinarily when I visit the Rent A Center that shares the lot is closed, you might have issues with parking if you go at lunchtime. -While ordinarily very friendly and nice, I have heard some of my friends complain that Rick Lai (the owner) calls customers out publicly for low tips.  Also I read/hear that he is hesitant to give refunds or allow staff to remake dishes if there is a customer complaint.  This might be a culture difference, but if True I find that to be unacceptable.",

We took in a couple of bottles of red which they gave us glasses and an opener for. The service was great, everyone who worked there was super attentive.  We had the vegetarian dumplings which had tofu and scallions in them and they were delicious. I ordered the vegetarian pho as my main entree and was in love. It had a wealth of vegetables and also tofu which was amazing, the broth was fantastic. This was my first time eating pho but I had been seeing it and it looked so good I couldn't help but get it. It was amazing and I will def. be going back for more. My husband ordered the tofu with lemongrass sauce and he also raved.  We can't wait to go back again.",

    "text": "This, I believe, is the best sit-down restaurant for Vietnamese food in Charlotte, based on the quality and taste of the food, the friendly service, and the decor.  The outside of the building is a little misleading: it looks like an old taco stand that's too close the road.  Once inside, however, one sees that it's got a simple, modern look to it, almost minimalist, with a warm, comfortable feeling.  And it's very clean looking.  Nice music played in the background.  I ordered a grilled pork dish with crab cake and rice, and the presentation was very good: it looked like art.  The smell from the grilled pork was phenomenal, the crab cake was terrific, and the dish was served with real broken rice as it is supposed to be done.  No corner cutting with sticky rice here.  Being naturally curious, I ordered a raw beef appetizer (bo tai chanh).  They weren't kidding.  I assumed It would be marinated in lime juice for hours, which cooks the meat in the enzymes like ceviche, if you've had that.  The meat should be whitish, not bloody.  When it arrived I couldn't eat it, however, because it was, well,  . . . raw.  We asked them to quickly cook the meat, which they did, and the spices still came through so it was tasty that way.  My friend had pho, and it had a pleasant taste with strong overtones of basil.  Both the man and the woman owners were super friendly--answering our questions about the music and the entrees.  We would go back there again in a heartbeat.",

I'm assuming he heard our order from the back and prepared it quickly for us. The restaurant was dead so there shouldn't be a rush or delay in our food...  The rice plate I ordered had grill beef and grilled shrimp on skewers...Now how did this guy grill it so quick to be plated already?? Well.. its because it was pre grilled and just microwaved. The whole plate tasted like it was just microwaved and sent out asap.   So disappointing how these asian restaurants are fooling the americans of Vietnamese food that should be good but isnt. American's don't know any better so they are served what they think is good but its crap... Fooling people for their money is wrong..

My first foray into the unknown was at the Vietnam Grille...  The staff was really helpful... As soon as I walked in, I was greeted warmly... I let them know I had no idea what to order... We shared a laugh and I told them I knew that everyone keeps talking about their Pho, so I went for it... They also suggested the crispy spring rolls as another good option for a novice, so I took an order of those as well...  I settled on the Pho Ga... I noticed the rice noodles in the bag, so I put those in the broth and went to town...   It was absolutely divine... NOW I get what the hubbub is about... The spring rolls were great... Crisp and filled with well-spiced pork...  Fabulously done...   Full disclosure?  I didn't realize there was another little take out box of stuff inside the bag to go in the Pho, so I missed the whole bean sprouts, fish sauce, herbs, lime (?) and jalapenos until the very end! lol Once I added those, it completely changed the flavor... It was still yummy... I wish I had known that from the beginning, though! lol Next time I get food from a region that I'm unfamiliar with, I'll make sure to take home some instructions as well...   There are quite a few other things on the menu that looked intriguing as well, so join me in welcoming Vietnam Grille to my restaurant rotation... :)",

Two coworkers and I arrived at a slow time (only one other table is occupied). One of us asks the \"chef\" what he recommends, and we can't get an answer other than to try the \"sampler appetizer plate,\" which was also the most expensive thing on the menu. Long story short, the food was decent, but nothing special. Better fare at the Siagon Palace. Lastly, it took 25 minutes from the time we asked for the check to the time we finally were able to leave! that is just ridiculous.

I had pork over broken rice and my husband had a grilled chicken dish, both had a nice balance of heat and were not overly sweet-- as so many Asian dishes are made to suit the American (and southern) palate.  The service couldn't have been nicer, they were prompt and friendly and the overall tab was very reasonable. We will be back soon!",

Accompanied by lettuce, cilantro, pickled carrots/radishes and dipping sauce (would it be terribly rude to drink it?).    A couple of weeks ago I tried the rare beef salad from the appetizer menu. Wow. Not for the faint at heart, but I enjoyed this. It really *is* rare. Seasoned to perfection, topped with crushed peanuts and some greenery (I'm going from memory here--probably green onions and/or cilantro). Accompanied by lime wedges, marinated carrots/radishes and dipping sauce.   I did have a side bowl of their marvelous pho--a visit wouldn't feel right without it. :-)  The most important thing about Vietnam Grille (besides the pho)  is that they pay attention and they care.  They care about your choice of food and how you liked it. They remember you when you come back (months later!). They help you try something different.  That makes all the difference in the world between a place you merely like and a place that comes to mind every week.",

The grilled pork was very, very dry. It had decent flavor but it was hard to tell because they were cooked way too much. They were tiny also, but overall flavorful.  The meat for the pho tai was more cubed than it was thinly sliced.  The broth was heavy with lime and the smell of cloves. Very little, if any, cilantro in the soup's base. The noodles were good and came apart easily.  Overall pretty good. I would come again but I wouldn't order rolls.",

Appetizers Recommended:  - tofu rolls, chicken and shrmp rolls, sauteed squid (awesome), stuffed grape leaves.  Misses: dumplings (why get dumplings at a Vietnamese restaiurant anywy), chicken salad (average).  Pho Just go down the list...chicken pho, tendon, tripe, flank stteak...all are phenomenal. Seasoned perfectly so give it a taste before you grab the siracha or hot chili oil. I would recommend paying the extra buck or two for additional meat - and it's easily two meals.  Bun Another home-run...the pork meatball is out of this world...typically get that with spring roll and maybe add another meatball...whoosh!  Other Rice dishes are really good, catfish stew/soup was awesome, vegetarian dishes are solid, etc.  Ricky and Tommy are the guys you'll encounter both in the kitchen and front of house....super nice guys, tons of experience in the business and generally care that their customers are happy (sometimes a little bit overbearing but I can live with it)!

Two of the six entrees that are veg-friendly are sauteed greens. The other four are all slight variations on the tofu and vegetable theme, some with noodles, some with rice... blah.   The goi cuon app we shared was passable, but not nearly as exciting as others I've had. Classic case of what happens when you tone down the flavors in this particular dish: you end up with a mouth full of rice paper, rice noodles, and bland tofu. There has to be a lot of herbs to brighten that mother up, and there were maybe two or three slivers of thai basil to be found.  Of course, this was all compounded by my roving eyes; everyone else was happy (and all were ordering pho). The bowls and plates being delivered to the other tables looked tantalizingly tasty. So ya, I'm obviously missing the boat due to my lurv for the animalz.  So there you have it:  the veg side of Vietnam Grille is dissapointingly close to boring ol' chinese stir fry. Maybe they'll beef (heh) up their selection one day, but 'till then, I'll stick to LV and BT.",

    "text": "I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars because it really fails my standard expectations of a Vietnamese restaurant.  Let's start with pros: - I only ordered to go but the staff was courteous and service was prompt. - the restaurant was clean.  Cons: - I ordered \"com tam\" which is a rice dish. However, when I opened my box after I left the restaurant, I found myself with rice noodles instead of rice. Weird. Don't know if they ran out of rice or something. But a heads up would have been appreciated.  - I ordered the spring rolls to go. It says 2 pieces for $5. I opened my box and it was TINY TINY rolls. Like the regular size cut in half.  Disappointment.",

Basically, I didn't think it was all that.  Basically, I thought it was like Chicken soup on steroids.  A few extra bells and whistles but at the end of the day, broth with noodles and some meat.  Seriously, am I wrong?  Help me understand!    I will say that a friend ordered one of the curry dishes and it looked so good and so fresh.  I was panting all over her dish because my Pho wasn't cutting it.    The chicken spring rolls with peanut sauce were ON POINT!!!  I wish I made a meal out of just those bad boys.  They were so good and that peanut sauce was euphoric.  Amazing.    I love that you can BYOB, the prices are right and the service was friendly.  I will come back but not for Pho.",

    "text": "Sigh.  VG, we're through!  Sure, we had some good times - but sadly, I always thought I could do better.  That was definitely a sign that I should've left earlier.  We tried to work through it because after all, I love pho and you serve pho.  Love at first bite.  But you know what you did...it was a DEAL-BREAKER in my book!  And no, those aren't tears wept for days gone by, no, these tears are freedom tears. (?)  I'm no longer under your spell.  Time pho me move on and pho-getaboutchu.  You still don't know what you did?  You want me to take you back?  Sorry, I've moved on.  It was 8:45PM on a chill Friday night and my sister was in town.  Destroyed mentally, physically, spiritually, financially, and (insert another adverb) after a rough Thursday night, a few of us decided to play it low-key and hit up VG for some pho and call it a night.  My heart skipped a beat.  It always does when I think of you, VG.  Imagine my shock when YOU WOULDN'T LET ME IN AT 8:45PM DESPITE THE SIGN SAYING YOU'RE OPEN UNTIL 9PM.  LET ME IN (giggle) How dare you.  You know me, service is everything.  Having worked in customer service, for well, my entire working life, this kinda stuff is unacceptable.  Think of the disappointment you cause...    I want to go on a Michelle P-esque rant right here.  But I'm all cried out, I mean, it's not worth my time.  Your pho is nice, but I've seen better.  Your spring rolls?  It's okay but everyone's got some.  No beer?  Yeah, we ain't hanging out sober.   We had a good run... you and I.  But change is a part of life.   WTF, Dan, are you going on a 4-month vacation?  BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT A LOT OF BAGGAGE.  Is this review even about a restaurant?  dmo out",

    "text": "Great find. Glad I followed the reviews to find this gem. We shared the crispy rolls - ground meat wrapped in rice paper and deep fried. Hot like fire; burning your mouth but delicious. They come so hot you want to eat them fast but you can't. Light dipping sauce, small amount of fresh veggies and lettuce leaves. I wrapped mine in lettuce to tame the heat. I would get these again. I got the beef pho and man candy got the chicken pho. The beef was very strongly spiced with cinnamon and star anise. More than I was expecting and I've had pho before. The chicken was mild, nice large pieces of white meat. Both served with generous toppings plate: Thai basil, sprouts, jalapeno and lime wedges. All fresh, no wilted veg here. Sodas are canned, man candy says, \"good coke, good ice\" and \"those little fried things were good\". Overall, awesome meal under $30.",

There is just something so comforting and soothing about a giant bowl of pho. During my latest venture here, I placed a take out order. The sweet server (without asking, completely on her own) brought me a cup of hot tea while I waited for my food. All the workers here are so nice.   I love VG's pho. Delicious broth, good amount of sliced flank steak and meatballs, fresh fixings. I'm also a fan of the crispy pork rolls and the fresh spring rolls. I try to discipline myself to only order one of those, but temptation wins more times than not... and I get them both. I'm so weak when it comes to food.  My order of pho and crispy rolls came to $15. Seems a little bit pricier than other places... but nothing too terribly out of control. Did they raise prices here? I don't feel like it used to be that much.  Yes, Vietnam Grille is an odd stand alone location right in front of a shopping center on South Blvd. I know that can seem kind of sketchy, but trust me. Stop in for a meal... you won't be disappointed!",

Don't be afraid, they also have the more tame versions with out the icky bits I love so much.  Hubbie, a vegetarian, loves the shrimp curry which has a wonderful green curry sauce.

A word of caution: the Vietnamese do not fool around with herbs. If you are not a fan of basil or cilantro, be warned that they are fresh and potent.  Fortunately, I like fresh and potent. Maybe it was because I came during nontraditional hours, but the service was quick. Either way, I'm definitely keeping them in mind for a good place to treat out-of-towners.",

The bun, which is vermicelli noodles with a light sauce is also very good.   **TIP: if you are greedy like me and can't live without the taste of pho soup without leaving a Vietnamese place, I order a side of the soup whenever I get a non-Pho entree, haha.   Smoothies are very badass as well, try the strawberry or the soursop.  I go there a lot though, so I've noticed the music variety doesn't seem to change.

In cool weather, the PHO soup will warm you up and smells heavenly with fresh Anise and herbs.  The filling BUN noodle dishes feature grilled meats, fresh lettuce and veggies and  sauce.  And you won't find better CURRY dishes within miles.  Friendly and attentive service will make this a place you'll come back to again & again.  Bring a bottle of your own wine and make it a dining experience, or if you're in a hurry you can be in and out in minutes.",

Everything was fresh and crispy and flavorful. The lemongrass tofu was phenomenal as well. I asked them to make it spicy, which they did, but they also brought out some orange peppers to eat with it (now THOSE are spicy - beware!) The vegetables (broccoli, bok choi) were very crunchy and well-marinated. Love Vietnam Grille - highly recommended. Do not miss the strawberry smoothie if you're in the mood for dessert.",

    "text": "I love pho.  However, I've never been to Charlotte so having gone there for a dragon boat event and someone in my group wanted Pho, i turned to the trusty yelp to find me a spot to try.    The restaurant is a stand alone restaurant in a strip mall type plaza.  Its a clean small-ish (well ok maybe it was medium sized) restaurant.  We all got pho -- i got the special which had tripe, tendons, meatballs, and beef.  Unlike the spots we frequent back home, the tripe and tendons were there in chunks --- there is no hiding those delectable hunks of meats.  The meatballs were cut in half, similar to everywhere else i go.  The one thing that makes this a 3 star for me is there is no option of ordering a smaller bowl -- i typically will get a small since the large sizes are way too much food for me -- the restaurant has a one size fits all approach on their phos.  In addition, the broth was too cinnamon-ny for me.  While some people may like this, its not my preference.  Now I always get a cafe su dat as well, this one was a bit different from what i'm use too.  The places we go to often will bring out the coffee, brewing on what is similar to a french press, and then you get to pour and stir it into the sweetened condensed milk and ice.  Again, the coffee flavor wasnt my favorite, the places i go here in MD/VA use Cafe Du Monde's hickory coffee blends.. but it was ok.  Would I visit the restaurant again?  Sure.  There was a decent pho (slightly more cinnamon flavor than i like but still good), it was clean, there were attentive wait staff.",

    "text": "Note: I judge Vietnamese places on four things: pho, spring rolls, peanut dipping sauce and avocado shakes.   Vietnam Grille just didn't impress me on any level. For such a highly regarded Vietnamese joint, I expected a lot more. The spring rolls were on the the smaller side. While the fillings were fresh, they were missing something. The peanut sauce was overly sweet and not that peanuty. The pho was severely over spiced and much too fragrant. The star anise was an overpowering flavor in the broth. The pieces of flank steak weren't the beautifully, paper thin slices that I've had at every other Vietnamese place. The tendon was undercooked and too chewy... Definitely not my fave. The avocado smoothie was no where to be found on the menu... One of the things I love about Vietnamese food is how much food you get for the price. I thought that Vietnam Grille's prices were on the higher end of what I'm accustomed to seeing.   The positives... The service was fine and the parking was plentiful.   Needless to say, I'll be continuing my search for my go-to Vietnamese joint in Charlotte.",

I'm reluctant to say that it's the best pho in Charlotte. I think that people overdo that \"best in...\" line. Just say it's your favorite. That will suffice. Unless you've been to each and every one of them, you can't really say that it's the best. but i digress...  Vietnam Grille doesn't have as many options as Saigon Palace and Doans, but their headliner, the pho is terrific. I think that their secret is the star anise. They put in more than their competitors and thus the broth is more flavorful and gives you that great aroma. I've had the rice paper rolls too and those were good. My buddies and I used to go to Sports & Fitness and would often get lunch at Vietnam Grille post workouts. I've seen them order other stuff from the menu and they weren't disappointed.   It's pretty simple inside, but it's clean and nice. And the service is pretty good too.   I would give it 5 stars if they had a greater selection. But overall I would definitely recommend it.  the pho is awesome here.",

I went all out, the #33 house special - meatballs, fried spring rolls, shrimp, chicken, etc. Their sauce was a really nice blend, not too fishy (one of the women credited the use of a milder oyster fish sauce, not super strong fish sauce). Everything in the bowl was cooked perfectly, I was just very happy.  The lunch clientele was a nice mix - police officers, groups on lunch breaks, tables of one. The staff, honestly, sealed the deal for me. Although two women filled my water, the chef took my order, and another man actually brought me my food - they were all so friendly, easily striking up conversations and genuinely wanting me to enjoy my food in the best possible way.

I enlisted a more-experienced co-worker and we made our way down South Boulevard for a Friday lunch.  Vietnam Grille is not in the trendy stretch of South Blvd, but it's clean and the staff are quite professional.  I accepted the advice of my co-worker and tried the pho with brisket.  It was love at first taste.    The soup itself was velvety and delicious, and it's served with a fun array of add-ins (which is standard when it comes to pho, as I understand it).  Our waitress was attentive and courteous, and our food arrived quickly enough after we ordered.  My only point of criticism is that drinks are served in cans, and you have to pay for refills.  This normally doesn't bother me, but if you are not careful with the chili garlic sauce, you might find yourself desperately in need of replenishment.  Fortunately, water is free.",

    "text": "Being half Asian myself (Filipino), I of course love Asian cuisine. In my almost 50 years of life, I have had mixed experiences when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. However, and thankfully, Vietnam Grill was definitely a PLUS! From the outside, it looks kind of ordinary. But don't judge this book by its cover! The inside is much nicer than the exterior suggests, and the food is the star here.  To start, we had the Cha Gio (Crispy Spring Rolls). Now one thing to keep in mind about Vietnamese is that they are meat eaters.....more so than other Asian cultures (with the exception of Koreans who love meat as much). These spring rolls reminded me of my Mom's rolls, who stuffed them with plenty of meat. This one was loaded with pork, onions and mushrooms. And were they ever yummy, especially with the Asian fish sauce (which we called Patis).   For dinner, my wife had the crispy pan fried noodles with beef, and GOD were those ever delicious! They loaded it up with beef and a wonderful brown sauce which were soaked up the crunchy noodles. They they topped it with lots of fresh Cilantro, and what a flavor rush!  I had the Traditional Vietnamese Hot and Spicy Curry with Chicken. This too was good, but not nearly as good as what my wife had. Not sure about the \"hot\" part of this dish as I didn't think it was hot at all. In fact, I wouldn't even qualify it as \"spicy\" let alone hot. Still it was tasty.  It seemed like everyone around us was enjoying Pho. So next time, it's the flank steak and briskett Pho!  Overall an excellent meal and I can't wait to try their Pho!",

The owner comes out often to talk with diners and visit with regulars. He treats them like friends.   The atmosphere is very casual. Parking is generous, as the restaurant is housed in a freestanding building located in the parking lot of a strip mall.   My favorite dishes are: Bo Tai Chanh (raw flank steak) Banh Xep Hap (steamed dumplings) Soup Ga Thap Cam (small chicken soup with veggies) Pho  AND...the drink I will drive across town for, Nuoc Dua - Coconut drink. LOVE this stuff. It's basically water from young coconut with scooped out pieces of the flesh from the inside of the coconut added to the glass. It is served with a spoon so you can easily access the coconut meat. I want one now, as I am writing this.  I really don't have anything bad to say about the place. I guess the seating could be a little more comfy, but it's a very casual place. Oh, and I wish they served the pancake dish (Banh Xeo). -- Definitely not star-knocking issues.",

I had the pho tai which wasn't the best, but definitely not the worst. I am used to my dad's pho which has a different flavor and better beef. There was a smokey taste in the pho to which my friend said they could've put a lot of star anise in it.",

Second clue.   I proceeded to order a VIETNAMESE SANDWICH.   She asked me if I wanted pork, chicken or tofu.   Third clue.   I chose pork.   It took about 15 minutes to produce a sandwich.   The sandwich was nothing like a Vietnamese sandwich should be.   Slices of dry meat, some cilantro and picked carrots, no mayonnaise, and no jalapenos.   Interesting.   The bread was good.   After eating this smallish, dry, generally unflavored sandwich, my stomach starting feeling funny.   I suspect that the meat had been left out at room temperature for too long.   My advice, DO NOT GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.",

I'd never heard of it....never seen it in passing,  and it was considered a local \"hole in the wall\" type place.  Last thing I want to do is eat a type of food I've never eaten before and also try it at a \"hole in the wall\" type place.  I was prepared for the worst but what I got was completely opposite. I was completely blow away.  Everything from the service, to the food, to the location to the decor was awesome.  You can bring your own wine and or beer without a corking fee.  When I heard that, I was sold.  Our bill at the end of the night for two people was $37.  We've never come out that inexpensive for dinner.    I had the seafood Pho and it was really delish.  I loved the plate full of Thai basil, sprouts and limes that I could add to my soup.  The flavors were so good and the soup was steaming hot!  So glad I was exposed to Vietnamese food and I look forward to trying it again!!",

I ordered the Com Tam Ga Nuong which is chargrilled lemongrass chicken over rice. It was a very nice size portion for the price! The chicken was tender and juicy and I added some of the chili sauce to kick it up a notch and the flavors were perfect together.

    "text": "There's a reason why most of the reviews here mention not only the great food, but also the service.  The owner and chef is one of the most immediately likable people I've ever met.    Bob and I stopped in after a long sojourn to the mall (wedding registries are energy vampires), and we were in desperate need of good food.  The food was great, all right.  Bob had a delicious bowl of Pho, and I had the Bun house special (to try every type of meat they have).  I was surprised at how delicious my bowl of noodles were.  They looked simple at first, but with the grilled meatballs (so so good) and other meats, the in-house fish sauce*, and the cucumbers and lettuce shreds on the bottom to mix throughout, it was very good.  More than that, it was heartwarming.  Comfort food!  I think any Southerner can enjoy that feeling, in whatever language.  I had a long chat with the owner, who talked about how much he cares about fresh ingredients, the best quality ingredients, and authenticity.  He's not a fan of food from cans--he can't stand the baby corn and water chestnuts that most Asian food is doctored with.  He also tries to keep his food affordable, and almost every entree on his menu hovers around 10 dollars.  Love!  And, by the way, he said he keeps tabs on his online reviews, so he knows where he needs to improve and how.  Oh, and this place is clean, clean, clean.  The bathrooms were sparkling.  I think that's all you need to know.  We'll definitely be back, as soon as we need some more heartwarming.  Maybe as soon as a week or two from now, when it's sure to be much colder.  *Do NOT shy away from this stuff; even the owner agrees that a lot of fish sauces are nasty and fishy, and this is his version...it is delicious--savory and not fishy at all, so at least try it!",

While other restaurants' food seems mass-produced, the food at Vietname Grille tastes like it was cooked just for you; the flavors really stand out.   As a fairly recent transplant from LA, and a huge fan of Vietnamese food, I do my best to come and eat here.  You have to know that amazing Vietnamese food is very common in LA and Orange County areas, so I'm very, very picky, and I know what authentic Vietnamese food is like.  If you want the best in Charlotte, Vietname Grille is where you want to go.  As others have noted, the service is very friendly and down-to-earth.  The place is also immaculate!    The only thing I would request is that the portions of the main entrees (bun, pho, rice, etc.) be a little larger.  Of course, that's because I like to eat lots and lots of food.  The portions are actually right-sized; I just can't get enough of it!  Try:  bun with meatballs (the meatballs are packed with flavor), cia gio appetizer (the vietnamese egg rolls that use the correct type of rice paper), and the beef wrapped in grape leaves appetizer.",

They say that only 10% of unhappy customers make a complaint to the restaurant. Well I guess we were in that 10% this time which is very rare of my girlfriend and I to be in.   We walked in at 8:25 pm, 35 minutes till close so we thought we were there in ample time to have a great dinner. The table staff were very prompt and very polite in taking our order, but it went all downhill from there.   My girl ordered the traditional hot and spicy chicken dish (#52 in the menu) and I ordered the House Vermicelli which seemed to be a very popular dish in the Yelp reviews. The food came out literally within 5 minutes after ordering as it probably should have since we were the only ones left. Once my girlfriend took a bit of her chicken, she instantly realized it was overcooked as it had a very rubbery feel and taste.  I also noticed that the little pieces of chicken I had in my dish was also overcooked.  So I called the server and told her about her dish.  So the chef (probably the owner) came out to ask what was the problem, and once we told him the issue we were completely shocked with his comments. He stated that unlike other Chinese restaurants he does not put baking soda in the chicken to keep it moist. We understand white meat chicken can get overcooked quickly and I told him that since this is white meat, it seems to have been done so. What does he turn around and say? \"That's why I don't order white meat, I prefer dark meat. I only cook with white meat because Americans prefer white meat.\" What kind of response is that? Are you serious!! I asked him if he could make something else and he denied our request and said the kitchen is now closed and there is no more food.  My girlfriend had no choice but to eat the broccoli with white rice. We didn't mention anything, hoping that they would just take out this dish from the bill, but they didn't even do that.  The owner noticed all the chicken on the plate when they cleaned up and so he came back out of the kitchen again, not to apologize, but to say the same thing about chicken and to say \"Next time try the Shrimp.\" I'm sorry buddy there will not be a next time.   Oh, the weird part which we realized after we left was a couple of the servers were having their meals... the kitchen is closed?  Really?   The food sucked and even though the young girls working were super sweet, the owner just made the experience pathetic by making us feel completely stupid.  We ended up going to Cheesecake factory thereafter to grab a snack since she was still hungry and there was no other place open.   Lesson of the day: Do not walk into a restaurant 35 minutes before they close and ask all the Asian restaurants if they use baking soda with their chicken.",

Broth was only lime juice and basil and the clams were tender, but bland (something was missing from the prep). The shrimp appetizer were smaller than the past and therefore not as tasty. One dish I like, the raw flank steak, was not on the menu. Hope these changes are not portentous of any further decline.",

    "text": "After seeing rave reviews for this place, I had to check it out. I've never had Vietnamese before but love other Asian cuisines so it was time to pop my cherry. In kind of a random location on South Blvd in the Sports and Fitness strip mall along with a Rent A Center and other small shops. If you're driving south on South Blvd, you have to make a u turn at the apartment complex right south of the restaurant and then you will be there. I wasn't sure what to go get but I heard from many that their Pho is great but after a weak lunch, I needed something with more substance and went with the Grilled Beef Bun  I absolutely loved it!! It was so light and flavorful along with all the sauces they provided table side. When it came out, the smell somewhat reminded me of pad thai because of the peanuts. I had the intention of eating half then take the rest home but was starving that I cleaned the plate--the portion was huge and worth every bite!   I felt like we ordered and BAM the food was out in an instant so that is a huge plus in my world. Kind and attentive staff  with instrumental music (I noticed \"Unbreak My Heart\" and \"Easy Like Sunday Morning\") that was soothing and enjoyable. One of the tables near us had the make your own spring roll sampler and that looked fun with a huge platter of goodies and would love to try that next time because there will DEFINITELY  be a next time with this place (with beer in hand)",

He mentioned that he (quite literally) eats here four or five times per week...I can see why!  Inside, Vietnam Grille is pretty basic and super clean. The owner and the waitresses were all very nice and made sure that our drinks were constantly filled and we were enjoying our meal. I ordered the spring rolls and the chicken pho. The spring rolls were very good and refreshing - wrapped in rice paper and filled with fresh shrimp, herbs and rice noodles - and came with a tasty dipping sauce. I could have easily (and happily) eaten five more for my lunch.   The chicken pho was the star of the meal though. The broth was light and nicely seasoned and it was the most generous helping of pho I've ever been served. Seriously, there was enough for three lunches. The chicken was tender and there were a ton, and I mean a ton, of noodles. If you want to get a delicious lunch that will last for days, this is the way to go.",

The commitment to perfection that owner Ricky pours into this restaurant is amazing and refreshing.   Every morning Ricky personally goes to markets to cherry picks the freshest ingredients. Never frozen or even overnight stored ingredients are used. The fresh broth is cooked 7-8 hours for each day. You can't expect the dishes prepared with any more fresh ingredients that what Vietnam Grille offers. The broth is addictive that makes me come back at least once a week. The funny thing is that I never get tired of eating the same dishes.   The menu is small and focuses on the main stream Vietnamese dishes.   The restaurant is clean always unlike many others.   The servers are extremely attentive yet not overbearing. Now they call me by my name as I walk into this place.",

There was a really strong smell of some spice (nutmeg, perhaps?) that made the broth taste different than what I'm used to, but it wasn't terrible. There was a good helping of tripe and tendon, but I felt it was a little lacking in beef balls (I got like 4 halves).  Oh, I also tried the cha gio (crispy spring rolls), and they were okay. Didn't have as much flavor as I'd like, and the skin was kind of... chewy, but overall, tasty. And it was five rolls for like $3, so definitely worth it.   Service was okay, nothing spectacular.   Overall, I'd recommend a try, but I think I'm going to try another one next time I'm in Charlotte.",

However their broken rice dishes are very tasty, filling, and inexepensive! They also have a large variety of other dishes here to try out as well for the more adventurous.  The restaurant itself is very clean and cozy. The service here is very friendly and helpful as well! The owner came out and chatted with my dad a bit.

    "text": "Having seen this place reviewed too many times by fellow Yelpers, I had to go out and give it a try.  As a weekly connoisseur of Vietnamese food in Charlotte's mainstays for the cuisine (thanks Lang Van and Ben Than!, I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing out on the next great thing.  Having tried it now, I can say it is good and (mercifully) cheaper than the competition, but it still needs a little work.  The first issue is location, I don't know about you, but I had a to make a special trip that far down South Boulevard.  And even then, I got the pleasure of pulling a U-y to get on the right side of the street to enter the parking lot.  If you are coming from uptown. this means you too.  The building itself is small and rather non-descript, standing as an outparcel on the edge of (yet another) S. Blvd. strip mall.  The inside was small but adequate and quite clean.  I don't know why this is apparently mandatory at Vietnamese joints, but they also had the jazzy-elevator music in the background pumping all the classics.  I also got a kick out of the wall \"art\" which was a very exact clock and calendar with the \"moving water\" around a non-descript island- so kitsch it was out of place.  Our waitress/server was a young girl how did not strike me as overly prepared for the job.  At first I wasn't sure that she was not another customer as she carried this small purse around with her that I later came to understand was where she kept her note pad and extra menus for taking orders.  That said, she did check on us several times and clear plates quickly.  Carnivores are in luck here as the menu was broken down by your meat of choice.  All the regular Vietnamese offerings are here- bun, pho, etc.  You basically pick your protein and voila!  Veggie friends need to turn to the back of the menu for a small offering of dishes, all of which basically have tofu (with the exception of the stir-fried mixed greens, which didn't sound over-appetizing).  I actually like tofu in my asian dishes, so this was okay for me, but the menu was a little light here and was especially weak considering the cross-town competition.  The wife and I had the tofu summer rolls and I have to say, they are quite a bit larger than elsewhere in town, and apparently this is due to the sheer volume of rice noodles inside the rolls.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the fresh mint and lettuce tucked into the very center, but the taste was somewhat lost of the volume of noodles.  I'd have toned this down to let the fresh herbs do their thing.  Luckily the peanut dipping sauce was nice and plentiful.  Apparently their hot sellers are their Phos, as every other table around us had this dish.  Kudos to the huge bowls and plates of fresh herbs that came with these dishes.  I could easily have shared just one and we'd have both been stuffed.  The portions were enormous and if that didn't fill ya, well, there'a gotta be a buffet somewhere nearby you can shut down.  For the wife and I, we went with the veggie curry and despite its appearance, it was quite taste.  Curry was yellow and a nice mix between spice level and pungency.  It had some mixed diced veggies in the sauce, but oddly came with a side of plain steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the veggies, but I didn't order curry because I didn't like the heat.  An opportunity was lost here.  Having looked at the final bill, though, I was pleasantly surprised.  Lunch for two for under $20, now we're talking.  In fairness, we did split the entree, but it was plenty sufficient for for us.  Still, the (comparatively) limited menu and missteps in the prep of our dishes holds this Grille back from becoming the new talk of the town.",

Maybe a little too fast--- within 3 minutes of ordering our food was brought out- surely our meals were essentially pre-made and assembled to order.  The pho ($8.55) was mildly flavorful but nothing special. I ordered a lemongrass chicken/shrimp/meatball combo plate ($11.55) with broken rice. Decent but not memorable. Fair, but not huge, quantities. Quality was a little above average.",

Alex, the owners son is very hospitable and the customers think he is very pleasant.   The chef is Rick, the owner and he always makes sure the food is presented well and at the correct temperature.     I eat here 6 times a week.   I have a reserved table everytime I come in.  Upon my arrival, Alex greets me at the door.     I would recommend Vietnam Grille to anyone who is searching for the best Vietnam restaurant in Charlotte.   Try any PHO dish-they are amazing!",

    "text": "I'll be honest and say I'm not incredibly familiar with Vietnamese food, but my boyfriend loves it, and we were in the mood for some good Pho last night.  We tried Pho Hoa in Plaza Midwood, and I thought it was pretty good, but the beef was a little fattier than I would've liked (which in a pho dish, is kind of unacceptable...it's the star of the dish!)    I'm very happy to say we didn't have that problem with Vietnam Grille.  We started off with the crispy spring rolls, which we dipped in mirin and chili paste and wrapped in the lettuce--so good!  He got a bowl of flank and brisket pho, and I got a bun dish with chicken (vermicelli and chicken and other goodies at the bottom of the bowl).  Mine was fantastic (helped by the fact that the dish came dry, and my BF created a delicious sauce for it from mirin/soy/chili paste/and a little fish sauce).  Chicken was lean and well-seasoned, and everything melded together beautifully.  His was tasty as well, although instead of cilantro they brought it with Thai mint, and I thought that was a bit overpowering.  But it still tasted terrific!  The service was excellent--frequent enough to see if we needed anything, but left us alone most of the time.  And the restaurant itself was clean and comfortable and quite nice.  Highly recommend this place, and I'm already planning my return trip!",

Directly across the street I saw the neon sign \"Vietnam Grille.\" It was calling me so I listened. Ordered #13 Steamed Dumplings and #2 Crispy Spring Rolls. For entree had the Pho #29 Sliced Flank Steak and tripe. Asked to make it without the tripe, but I guess the message did not get to the chef. Despite that it was delicious. Quite surprising how good the food was, and the place was very clean and friendly staff. Also had the Iced Coffee w Milk #81, which they made surpisingly quick compared to what I'm used to. Maybe because I came so late for dinner. All and all, when your appetite calls for Vietnamese cuisine, listen to the call for \"Vietnam Grille\" when you are in Charlotte.",

The tests is small and from outside you can't tell much.  The decoration inside is very interesting full of arts in the walls. It's very cozy and clean. The staff was attentive and very friendly always refilling our drinks and checking on us. Their menu is quite decent is many interesting options. Of course I had to choose Pho to compare with my previous experiences in other restaurants.  Everyone else in our group ordered the same dish (#33) and it looked very yummy, besides was a lot of food. My Pho was really good! The way I was expecting it to be. I don't remember the name but I remember the number 27.  My husband loves Vietnamese food and I can't wait to go back with him so he can try it!",

However, with this location getting a steady flow of business professionals I think they try to accommodate a fast paced working schedule. I slurrped my pho down to the last drop, there was plenty of meat with a good balance of noodles . I liked that they had the Asian hot pepper sauce and not just sirracha . Pricing was pretty generic to most Vietnamese noodle houses , if you are looking for that warm, hearty bowl of goodness this is a great spot .",

The length of their spring rolls is definitely half the size of what they sell in CA. The fried egg rolls have unidentifiable contents. Looked like ground meat of some kind, over fried and turned powdery when we took a bite of it. Overall, thumbs down",

Fresh spring rolls were good value for money, and tasty. Pho was fresh and flavorful, but could use a bit more \"sauce\" (which is what I'm used to). This a great little fast-food viet joint! You are served quickly and in a friendly manner, which always works for those on the run. I will not hesitate to return, especially at lunch time, since that is a busy time of day for me.  I also think this would be a great take out place, though I haven't used it that way yet. I saw several patrons come and go with big parcels of food. The decor is ordinary, but that's fine since fast food is not dependent on decor.",

Yelping this place with an overwhelming 70+ reviews which outpaced other viet restaurants in the area, I had my hopes up but didn't let my expectations get too lofty.  Man did this place disappoint big time. Everyone got a bowl of pho. And what I got was an expensive (9.25 for a regular size bowl is outrageous in any area of the country besides Charlotte for some reason) watery bowl of nothingness.  Meat  completely non existent. Veggies sparse.  Noodles even lacking which is usually used to replace lack of meat.  Meat was overcooked and not a beautiful medium rare. I tried to enhance the watery bowl of pho by asking for some fragrant nuoc beo but obviously this place did not have it. That means they either cook the pho with pho flavored cubes or beef broth cans with lean meat and not huge stock bones with lots of fat.  I recommend every pho loving person avoid this place at all costs.",

I do not give bad reviews just because of how I thought it tasted  I do think that cinnamon should be removed from the pho as it killed the taste. I drenched it in Hoisin and Sriracha to cover it up.

    "text": "Last time we were in Charlotte I dined with my parents at Vietnam Grille. We usually go to Saigon Palace, which is only a few blocks away, but this time we wanted to try something new. Vietnam Grille is fairly small and homey and is obviously family owned. It would be difficult to accommodate a very large group here but it is a nice and cozy place for a couple or family.  The menu is ranges from soups, noodles and rice dishes to traditional Vietnamese dishes and beverages. We tried the pictured house special vermicelli, which was very good - lots of picked carrots and radishes and tasty meat - as well as the seafood noodle soup. The soup didn't stand out as much as the vermicelli, but the fresh spring rolls were very good - one of my favorite foods! I don't think Vietnam Grille has the yellow pancake (banh xeo) we like so much on the menu. For that (and for large groups) I will keep going to Saigon Palace - or back to Vietnam - I hope to finally put some food photos from my SE Asia trip up soon! If you are in Charlotte Vietnam Grille is a solid choice for reasonably priced tasty food. I look forward to trying additional menu items on future visits.",

    "text": "We went over a year in Charlotte before discovering Vietnam Grill, and that delay ranks as our #1 regret since moving here. It's easy to miss, the stand-alone-in-a-strip-mall-parking-lot facade hiding a hub of tasty cuisine with fresh ingredients.   For those who haven't been, it shares a section of South Blvd with more well-known staples such as Bill Spoon's BBQ and The Clock.   It looks like they've had a few bad reviews of late, but our visit today was as good as ever. We only go about once a month, but the servers remember us right away and it only took about five minutes from order to service - perfect for a quick lunch.   The Bun dishes, especially the grilled pork and grilled meatball varieties, are always terrific. If you're not familiar, Bun = room-temperature rice vermicelli, a few mixed veggies (including some greens), topped with your meat of choice. Their house sauce, served on the side, is a smoother, cleaner version of a fish sauce. There's no real reason *not* to use the entire thing, as well as some of the house made chili sauce, but feel free to try just a little to get started.   The Pho is my other favorite, particularly the brisket & flank steak combination. Other options include tendon, tripe and meatballs (different from those served on the Bun), but I personally choose to get as much steak as possible because I'm a simple creature. Fresh sprouts, jalapenos, and basil are served on the side to add to the hot, delicious broth at your leisure. Again, I see no reason not use everything, but maybe I'm just a glutton for goodness.   I've had their spring rolls, summer rolls, and salt-baked shrimp on random occasions and enjoyed them all. I'm not a big appetizer person, though, so it's more an issue of personal choice than worthiness of the dish.   For the dinner crowd, an interesting distinction: this place is BYOB, so plan accordingly. Daniel (@CharlotteBeer) is a better pairing suggester than I, and he thinks a Saison would be a great +1 for any beer lovers looking to drop in.   Finally, I love this place because our family always has a good time there. The servers and chefs have all checked in on us and our year-old son during our visits, including spacing the delivery of our dishes during the months when the little guy was feisty at the dinner table, thus allowing my Pho to be warm when I finally got to eat. Big ups to any place willing & able to accommodate patrons of all shapes, sizes, and ages.   There, now I'm hungry for another trip back to Viet-nomnom.",

The tofu was crispy and so yummy.  For those of you who stick up your nose at the thought of tofu, I double dog dare you to come here to try it.  This restaurant is squeaky clean.  There is soft instrumental music playing that enhances the atmosphere.  It has a quiet vibe and would be really good for a date night place.   Several different people came by our table to see if everything was good. I am guessing one was the chef and one was the owner. There were a few servers.    Outstanding food.  Outstanding service.   If you're in south Charlotte, why drive to Lang Van when you have this as an option.   We are lucky to have such splendid Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte!",

The staff is very alert and inviting.   The food however is impressive. I ordered the Mi Hoanh Thanh and my friends ordered the Com Tam Suon - Tom Nuong and the Hu Tieu. There was a very pungent seafood smell when the food arrived but it quickly left. My soup was very delicious and the star of the dish was the wontons. They get bonus points because they give you a large portions and their prices are reasonable.

I make no claims to be a connoisseur of Vietnamese food. Actually, until my visit, I can't recall ever eating it at all. However, top echelon in the category or not, this was some darn fine food. It is certainly a little bit more pricy than your average Chinese or Thai restaurant (not too bad though, I spent about $12 compared to $9 for Chinese or Thai). But it is also distinctly different. I got the #32 bun based on a recommendation. Good gawd it was was delicious!! Unlike some of there other options (Pho I believe) the Buns are not a soup. Deceptive to their English word, they are also not a bread dish. The Bun is actually a rice noodle dish with various meats and vegetables thrown in. Mine had shrimp, chicken and beef. Everything about it combined for a culinary awakening. I have since moved about 10 minutes further away but have been back for takeout a few times. The only thing that stinks is I'm not a huge fan of making u-turns and coming south you have to make a really bold one to get to the parking lot with a potential car screaming blindly over the hill into your passenger side door. Ignore that it looks like a cheap diner on the outside. The only thing that matters is food and this is well worth the trip.",

Once I realized I thought to go elsewhere, but then thought let's give it another try, maybe it's improved. The waitress seemed not to understand my order.  I wanted bun with spring rolls shrimp and pork.  It came with a 1 inch by 1/2 inch tiny piece of pork.  No kidding.  6 or so shrimp and a fried spring roll cut up.  That part was correct.  But, the dish lacked any really interesting flavors.  The spring rolls were solid pork inside.  Not my favorite.   I've tried this dish elsewhere and there are much better dishes there up on Shamrock Rd.  My boyfriend is a big fan of beef pho and likes it a lot there too.  But here he said it was very light on the meat, flavor was so so, not his favorite.  The new decorations make it prettier inside, the prices are fair, and other staff seemed very friendly.",

Don't be afraid of the raw steak appetizer. It is fantastic. Sliced just thin enough to be wonderful. With cilantro and mint and topped with peanuts add some great crunch. Add a little sriracha to perk it up.  The #31 special Pho is the best. tendon, tripe, beef, pork in a great broth. the first time I visited they had brains as well, but I didn't specifically request it and this time, no brains. Still fantastic. $22 before tip to be completely stuffed with healthy, well prepared food. Can't beat that.",

They also don't have 10 different kinds of pho meat toppings that most people haven't heard of... which is kind of unusual for all the Vietnamese places I've been to. And they speak good English, again, very unusual.  I liked the spring rolls. I liked the pho. But the problem is, I just wish there was more of everything and that it was cheaper. I want more noodles, more meat, more bean sprouts!   It's too hard to justify paying $9 for a tiny bowl when I know I can get a heaping bowl somewhere else for $6. I'd come back if I'm craving it, but I plan on checking out some other nearby options first.",

    "text": "Nondescript little restaurant that may not have the best pho in town but is definitely in the top 3. What makes this 5 stars is the tendon in their pho. Most places that have tendon in their pho usually toss it in as an afterthought; you get a few measly little  pieces. Just enough to piss you off. Not at Vietnam Grille! It's like having a never ending bowl of tendon soup. Big chunks of tendon; some slightly chewy with a nice resilience, other pieces just melt in your mouth.  Last time I was there I requested my pho with all tendon; it was fantastic. The owner came out to see who ordered it; probably wondered what kind of freak orders a pho like that. He asked if I had tried tripe; yeah back in the day Mom would cook up that mushy nasty  stuff. I was like thanks but no thanks. He bought out a sample and this tripe was much different. Not mushy and foul smelling like what my mother made, this tripe had a nice texture with a bit of snap to it and a neutral scent. It was something that I would try again and am glad the owner let me sample some. He was great and genuinely interested in his customers.  There are other things on the menu, including a raw meat dish that I plan to try. If it wasn't on the other end of town for me I would eat here more.",

    "text": "---Brace yourselves, as this is a VERY long review----  Hanging out with other foodies in San Diego I was constantly dragged along on hunts for perfect pho. It was definitely a trend among the foodies to compare pho notes, finding the most bizarre and hidden vietnamese restaurants and bragging about it among other gourmands.   The fact is, I never really liked pho, my friends would ooh and ahh and suck down giant bowls of it. I'd do the same, thinking to myself, well this is good right? I just must not get it. Pho never really seemed all that special to me.  Having moved to the mountains of WNC, my cravings for vietnamese food have grown exponentially, not pho of course, but delicious spring rolls wrapped with lettuce and the like, maybe a bahn mi sandwich. The fact was, there are no vietnamese restaurants in Asheville, and you always want what you can't have.   On a recent trip to Charlotte I sought out the most accessible and highest rated viet restaurant, which just happened to be Vietnam Grille. I couldn't have been happier.  Open till 10, it fit right in with my schedule. Well lit, and open seating, I was pleased immediately upon entering. Wasting no time I asked for an order of crispy spring rolls. Delivered quickly PIPING hot, and amazingly crunchy, the spring rolls were like biting into little nuggets of heaven. A perfect blend of pork and shrimp.  When my server returned to take my order, I was torn between three items. The house special bun, the deluxe broken rice, and the pho. I didn't really want the pho though, it's just... that's what people get. I asked my server for his recommendation. He informed me that the pho was amazing. I winced, and flipped a coin for guidance.  Heads: Get the pho Tails: Get something awesome!  The coin launched into the air, and landed in my palm... heads. Fate had decided for me. It was time for the pho. Once again I was amazed at the speed in which my order was brought to the table. The pho came out steaming, beautiful. From the aroma it was instantly apparent that this was no standard bowl of pho. This was something special.  I got to the process I'd seen time and time again, tearing up the basil leaves, putting the meat under the noodles, adding the sprouts and lime juice. Just as I went to reach for the Sriracha a man came to our table, he looked at my bowl and said, \"Before you use that, try it first\" \"People always ruin the broth before tasting what the chef has prepared\"  I was taken aback, how could I be so rude? I instantly complied and brought a spoonful of the golden, transparent soup to my lips. To call it an explosion of flavor would be an overstatement, it was much more subtle than that. Tiny waves of flavor, layered together to form a perfect tapestry of delight rolled over my tongue. I had never tasted something so light, but full of character. Exceptional, something truly intelligent and delicious.   Suddenly it became apparent to me what pho was supposed to taste like, it's supposed to be like this. 3000 miles away from my friends in desperate search of the perfect bowl of pho, I was sitting right in front of it, and relishing every morsel of it. And to think that if I were to have added even a drop of Hoisin or Sriracha I could have tainted this perfect creation.  The man introduced himself as the chef and co-owner Ricky Lai. The rest of my meal was spent having a fantastic conversation with Mr. Lai about food, thought, practice, and the fact that Asheville is in DESPERATE need of a vietnamese eatery.   It was truly a pleasure to find and eat at the Vietnam Grille. It will surely become a source of pilgrimage when the cravings for vietnamese food become overwhelming.",

    "text": "So, this place is awesome.  despite my high expectations from the rave reviews, they were still exceeded by this place.  dont let the weird location or the minimalist interior fool you, what this place emphasizes is quality - from the ingredients to the presentation, its all superb.  even with the quality ingredients, prices are similar to other vietnamese restaurants, maybe $1-2 more on certain dishes.  this immediately vaulted to my favorite viet restaurant ever, i highly recommend it for any fan of the cuisine.    App -Bo Tai Chanh - \"beef tartar/carpaccio\" as described by the chef.  marinated in a sweet citrus marinade, it was phenomenal. Entree -House Special Bun - bun is a staple of any viet restaurant.  had to try it.  simply put, its really good bun.  fresh, high quality veggies, shrimp, meats epitomizes the refreshing nature the dish should have.  Instead of Nuoc Cham sauce they have a house Nuoc Mam sauce, which is sans chili peppers and is a little sweeter.  still very delicous -Pan fried Rice Noodles - special of the day.  very good, not at all oily, served with a good helping of sauteed veggies.  not too much to say, was delicious and i have lots of leftovers.   BONUS!! -pho sample - if you like speaking to owners/chefs, definitely go at an off time because he likes to come out and talk.  my table was the only one there and he chatted us up quite a bit.  he guided us through the beef tartar, talked a little bit about banh mi, and then he INSISTED that we try the pho and brought out small bowls.  it was great pho-nomenal; he explained how he uses various aromatics, not just star anise, to make the broth.  cool conversation, and i am definitely getting the pho next time.",

The meat was a little over cooked liked they boiled the meat in the broth pot first then add it to the bowl. I should have noticed that everyone around us ordered bun. Maybe next time, if we go back, we will order one of the grill plates. Hence, Vietnam GRILLE.",

The shrimp wraps are deceptively simple but tasty - mint, shrimp, rice noodles and green onion.  Wow! My kids like the meatball things - don't know what spices they use but it's delicious.

I went there for lunch yesterday with a bunch of friends, and 5/6 of us ordered some variant of pho. We were briskly served two big plates heaping with the trimmings. Stomachs were filled. Faces were smiling. Bowls were emptied.  Service was snappy and attentive. The chef came to speak with us and was quite cordial.  I can't get enough of it. I am eating the leftovers as I type. I'll be back again soon. Check out my previous review for more of the deets!",

We ordered some Crispy Spring Rolls and #26 which is the Beef Pho. Spring Rolls were delicious, all the sauces on the side of table went on to my plate to make a delicious dipping sauce. The Soup arrived --Huge Bowl! Filled with a delicious broth and noodles and beef and then all the extras on the side to add, the bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapenos! It was piping hot and delicious..You have to try it ..I will be going back again and again!!",

Menu is easy to read and describes the offerings well... which should be a plus for those new to Vietnamese cuisine.  Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone with a cold or flu.  The pho will fix 'ya.

After recommendations from two people in just as many days to check out Vietnam Grille, I moseyed my way there to check it out during dinner break.    Definitely not seedy like another I recently visited, VG is bright and clean.  Tiny, and packed with people on a Tuesday evening.  People were bringing in their own bottles of wine, and very clearly having a good time.   Ultimately, the bun is just delectable here.  Noodles not gummy, cooked just right.  Plenty of grilled flavor in the chicken and meatballs.  Lots of crunchy peanuts and scallions, but where was the cilantro? I usually can't get enough cilantro in my Vietnamese food, but surprisingly, I didn't miss it in this dish.  Good sign.   Liked how fresh tasting everything was, and the little details like the extra long chopsticks, and carrot slivers, cut with a ripple pattern. The iced tea is nice and strong, served with lime.  Biiiig plus in my book. Nothing worse than weak tea.   TIP: The service is really friendly, and the dishes came out lightening fast.    Next on my list it to try the pho!",

We were the only customers here. My little brother ran out of water twice, but they never came to refill our water unless asked. It would have been a 5 star since they were nice, but the place wasn't busy and they never checked up on us unless we get their attention, therefore the overall customer service is a 3. We got three pho dac biet and one pho meatball, out of the 4 we made 2 of them small for the 2 kids. The pho is so and so, the taste was a little off.  When the bill came out,  we were charged at full price for the two small pho which was not worth at $10.95 each. Had we known this, we would've just gotten a regular bowl of pho for the two kids instead of asking for two small bowl of pho. The two regular pho is not worth for what it is. All the pho had very few meats. The variety of vegetables/herbs was very little, there were only basil, lime, jalapenos, and bean sprout.  Overall for the taste of pho and the variety of herbs/vegetable, I would give it a 3.",

The first thing you notice when you walk through the door is the small army of wait staff standing with military precision to the left of the door, hands clasped behind their back, waiting to attend to your every need.  The interior was furnished in a plain and forgettable, but clean and pleasant manner.  Pretty much every other small, unassuming ethnic restaurant with uninspired decor you have ever been inside.  Who cares, though.  We are quickly seated and began poring over the menu.    My better half knew exactly what she wanted; I was not very hungry and had a lot of trouble choosing.  After much deliberation over the merits of various dishes and sauces and meats, we ordered.  I ordered ground pork fried spring rolls, the lady ordered pho.  Our food came out so fast I suspected telepathy, or perhaps a long heat lamp bar full of two hour old pre-prepared food.  As we dug into our meals these heartless thoughts were abolished.  My \"appetizer\" was huge, five spring rolls and a plate piled high with vegetables of the green, leafy, cruciferous sort.  The pho was a generous portion, but not too big.    Throughout our meal we never seemed to have a dedicated waiter, we were simply waited upon by whoever was available.    This efficiency based method of serving was strange, but... efficient?  Upon requesting our check it appeared at the table in about twenty seconds, no kidding.   Based on one visit, I would certainly return again.  The prices were fair, the food was excellent, and the service was great.   Don't base your verdict on the unassuming look of this joint, go eat there.",

Savory and smooth broth, spiced well, filled with crunchy scallions, bean sprouts, fresh jalapenos, vermicelli, and a nice helping of thinly shaved beef.   Two entrees and rice paper rolls for only $22. We'll be back really freaking soon. So good.",

    "text": "Terrible customer service from the cashier on staff yesterday afternoon. She did not take the time to listen to what I wanted. Due to the language barrier and her terrible listening skills, she did not explain clearly they were completely out of vegetarian soup for the remainder of the time they were open. I asked her for soup and told her that was all I could eat and she directed me to the back of the menu and said these. To my understanding she was pointing to all soup options which is what I told her I wanted initially. I placed an order and when i received it, to my surprise  there was no soup at all. I asked her why did I not get soup? She began arguing and yelling at me in front of the rest of the customers in the Resturant. I had to tell her several times there is no need to argue and as a business owner you should make sure you understand what your customer is asking for. Instead of focusing on making a sale. She Told me I would have to keep it even though I have dietary issues because they weren't paying for it. Which is why I informed her I only wanted soup initially. Fortunately there was a very kind and reasonable business man that worked there. He resolved the issue and apologize and gave me my money back. He was aware that she did not explain well because she could barely speak English. Note of advise put someone at the register that is familiar with customers etiquette and knows how to speak and understand English well. It could have been the stigma and stereotypes they apply to all Blacks is why she treated me that way but there was no respect at all from her and she needs to take a back seat if she can't treat all customers the same.",

We shared a big cabbage salad with cucumber and a light dressing with toasted almonds and peanuts. I had the Vegetarian Pho which was amazing and my dining companion had a chicken and rice noodle bowl. We shared a pot of oolong tea. We were both completely satisfied and left feeling great. I think we started a new CLT tradition.",

I want to give it a second try, so I came again, pho was a little better this time, but nothing special, definitely not worth the price. Also there don't have fried quails on their menu, something I always order when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Will not return again. One thing that's good about this place is that the service is good, the dining atmosphere is probably a little better than the other two Vietnamese restaurants on South Blvd. They also take Amex, which is a plus.   Compared to the other two Vietnamese restaurants on South Blvd. I like Seigon Palace's pho the most. Doan second, this place the least.   In terms of best pho in Charlotte, I vote for Pho Hoa on central Ave. The fried spring rolls and fried quail there are also delicious.",

But to be totally fair I usually get the same things... Vegetarian pho, veggie rice paper rolls and the crispy spring rolls... Man I am hungry just thinking about it!  I have sampled other items but those are my favorite... The soups are so delicious and served traditional Vietnamese style with fresh basil, cilantro ,crunchy sprouts, lime etc.  don't come here for the ambience or decor... It's not fancy but the food is delicious and really that's why you need to come here.  Service is always fast, although it does get crowded for lunch during the week.  Oh and the soups are literally 2 meals!  I have never been able to finish in one sitting and I can eat a lot!",

A search on the Yelp app directed me to VG.  Friendly, FAST service. I had shrimp rolls (sans pork); they were cool and crunchy and fresh but the dipping sauce sprinkled with crushed peanuts was underwhelming. The pho tai was steamy hot and flavorful, the meat tender and still slightly rare, and it came with plenty of fresh toppings. However, maybe it was a fluke thing or maybe I am just a complete piggy, but my soup didn't contain very many noodles - in fact, the most scanty portion I've ever received with pho. I almost wanted to order a side of extra noodles to dunk in the broth.   Price was $15 - the pho was $10. This was the most expensive pho I've ever ordered, and the smallest portion (then again, it IS Charlotte, which is just a pricier area). Neither the pho nor the rolls blew me away with deliciousness or value, so I would try other Vietnamese places first in Charlotte before I would venture back to VG.",

I didn't expect it to come out cold. It was tasty, but not satisfying (mainly due to me wanting something hot). Although I have to say that the grilled shrimp were very delicious! Their chili and oil condiment was very spicy and a very dark red.  The space size is medium; I'm sure it can fill up fast on a busy night. The heat system was broken so they had a little space heater in one section. I wish they would have set us next to it.",

The summer rolls are a little on the skinny side and don't have much flavor, in fact, you need to soak it in sauce to make it taste like anything. The pho is solid, the broth is tasty and the meat cuts are the way they should be. But as I was slurping my pho during my second visit, I noticed that most people around me were having vermicelli bowls. So on my third visit I ordered the rice noodle vermicelli with char-grilled pork and a spring rolls, and it was excellent. The fish sauce mixture added the right amount of savoriness to the dish, the pork hit the right salty-sweet notes, the spring roll was crispy and the veggies added a nice freshness and crunch. This is my go-to place for rice vermicelli bowls and it should be yours too.",

    "text": "I believe I stated in another review for a Vietnamese restaurant that phos generally tasted all the same. However, this restaurant's pho is actually not as good as the others, for several reasons, including poor ingredient and other sanitary reasons.   I'd have to say that this place has pretty decent service. The owner likes to chat the customers up and is generally extremely cordial. Sometimes he does talk a bit too much because most of the times I eat out with a friend to chat with them, not the restaurant staff. He'll just keep talking and talking about how he's from Philadelphia and his experience and other things, and I can't really tell him to stop talking because I don't want to be a d!ck about it.   Their fresh spring rolls are pretty good. They do fill it with a good amount of pork and shrimp. Can't really get these things wrong.   Moving on to the pho. They're quite stingy with their sides. I usually get the combination pho. The raw flank beef they use is not very good quality. It tastes very... gritty. It just tastes very different from all the other phos I've had before. Does not taste as quality as others. The broth is decent.   One time I was there with my family. The four of us all got pho. My sister's pho came with a hair in it. We returned it for another one. Here's the kicker... They brought the bowl into the kitchen, and not 20 seconds later they came out with another bowl of pho. This time without the hair. My mom didn't say anything for fear my sister would waste her bowl of pho knowing that they probably just took out the hair and brought the bowl back to us (she's only 12 and a very picky eater). Needless to say, we haven't gone back since and probably never will again. The owner is a nice guy though.",

    "text": "This place is great. One of the best Vietnamese places I've ever had. I was skeptical when I pulled up because the place is really pretty unimpressive from the outside and is located in a gloomy area of town. But I've learned better than to judge a book by its cover. When I stepped inside everything was clean and modern looking and the hostess took care of me right away. I ordered the spring roll (unfried pork / shrimp) and the beef and meat ball Pho with extra rare beef on the side. The spring roll tasted fresh and crisp with a hint of mint. The Pho was sensational. It was on the spicy side (which I like) and the broth was excellent with a very rich flavor. The quality of the meat was also excellent. I'd love to go back again and highly recommend Vietnam Grille.",

    "text": "This was my first time eating Vietnamese food and I wasn't disappointed at all.  My husband ordered an iced coffee and I quickly followed suit.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  I am used to very strong coffee so when I go out, it's hard to find coffee that I like but this one was simply amazing.  I decided to try the Pho with meat and meatballs and my husband ordered the Pho with meat and tripe.  I loved the basil leaves that they give you to add to your meal and thought the broth was pretty good.  The meat was tasty but the meatballs weren't that great.  If you decide to order the Pho, I would recommend that you try it with something other than the meatballs.  My husband enjoyed his bowl of Pho as well.  We will definitely be going back here sometime soon!",

    "text": "I certainly can't consider myself to be a vietnamese cuisine expert, but if Vietnam Grille is any indication, I'm a huge fan!  Nestled in a inconspicuous corner shopping center off South Blvd, you have to look closely or you'll drive right by it.  Upon entering, I was immediately impressed by the hustle and bustle of the small restaurant during a weekend lunch and the tables filled with fresh vegetable dishes.  We started with the tofu rice noodle rolls - simple, chilled, and served with a tasty peanut sauce.  Then we shared two entress - vegetarian pho and the shrimp cabbage salad.  I've never had pho before, but will definitely be ordering it again.  The savory broth was filled with fresh vegetables and tofu and served with a side of bean sprouts, thai basil, and jalepenos.  The shrimp salad was a nice contrast with crisp cabbage, jumbo shrimp, and a citrus-fish sauce dressing.  Our party of two left with leftovers for an additional meal and a price tag less than $25.",

    "text": "I went back for a 2nd visit, given it is pretty close to the airport.  The pho noodle bowl was still as good as I remember.... Lots of meat and tasty broth.  I didn't get a MSG overload this time either.   The mistake was ordering a non-pure Vietnamese dish - shrimp w/ spring vegetables.  The dish had plenty of shrimps, but not very tasty.  The veges (Chinese Choi Sum) was depressing.   The thing I like most here is the food comes out quick and hot.  The waiter got my order wrong but upon pointing it out, they cooked up the correct dish within 2-3 min.",

    "text": "My kids and I enjoyed eating here. We all ordered Pho. The smallest size was more than enough for my kids to share. I really liked that the server knew to bring me a laddle making it easier to split my kids bowl. The soup was hot which I mention because I have been in some places and the soup was not hot enough and the noodles remain in clumps. The broth had a nice taste and service was great keeping our drinks filled. I often have my children with me and if they generally like the food thats a good sign. They both have eaten pho in many places and really enjoyed the soup here. When in the area we will definately visit again.",

    "text": "Vietnam Grille is located on South Blvd in a non-descript building that would be easy to miss.  Inside you'll find a very clean and bright dining area with friendly staff that are very polite and helpful.  There is a wide array of dishes to choose from: dumplings, spring rolls, grape leaves stuffed with pork, broken rice dishes, noodle dishes, and pho.  I got the broken rice house special in order to sample a good range of what was offered.  It included spring rolls, meatballs, chicken and shrimp and was delicious.  I was really impressed by the presentation - it is nice enough to be a dinner place and not overpriced.  You could get away with spending a little under $10 for your meal but most likely will be at about $15.  I'm looking forward to visiting again soon!",
