    "text": "The pub is fantastic, clean spot to grab a drink and bite to eat in Third Ward. My friends and I usually go on Wednesdays ($3 Yuengling drafts and 1/2 priced wine) and Fridays ($3 Mexican beer). They have limited outdoor seating but the inside is spacious and comfortable with a darts and a pool table. The food is surprisingly good for a pub but nothing exceptional. Expect large portions at fair prices (the chicken finger platter is huge) but nothing too flashy. I would recommend the chicken nachos for an appetizer and the Santa Fe wrap, buffalo chicken flatbread or chicken finger platter for your entree. Typically it's not overly crowded and the staff does a nice job getting drinks and food to you quickly.",

Honestly for a place called the Corner Pub I would think that they have greasy mediocre bar food, but nope the food here is really good!! I had their Cesar wrap and I loved it. Truly it was tasty! The Bar tender was awesome and there is a lot of seating. Only thing that I really don't like about this place is parking, good luck! Unless there is a lot close by that I don't know about the street is the only option, and it's tiny and difficult to find a spot. Over all though I truly had a nice time and I will go back :)",

Not a lot of places Uptown offer specials like this. We didn't try any of the food but it looked like an excellent selection of burgers and other bar type things. I will definitely make a trip back here again to give the grub a shot. Also, they supposedly have a pretty good Sunday brunch. $4 mimosas.  Enjoy!  PS  There is a breathalyzer on the wall that you can use to check your BAC before you leave.  Sweet!  -Ian M.",

The first time I came here was 2 years ago- the food was nothing special and the service was very slow. They don't check on you to see if you need anything and it takes a long time to get your food even though they are never busy. I decided to give it a second chance a couple months ago and this time it was even worse. My boyfriend and I sat down at a table and got completely ignored for about 15-20 minutes. The place is tiny so the staff walked by constantly, but they wouldn't even make eye contact with us. It wasn't busy at all but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved ourselves to the bar so that we could just order from the bartenders. The bartender ignored us and only helped the couples to the right and left of us. It's like they were going out of their way not to serve us. After waiting at the bar for another 15 minutes and not once being greeted or acknowledged in a total of 30 minutes, we left and we will never be back. You would think they would treat what few customers they have left with some decency.",

For some reason they don't turn the light on in their beer cooler so you might miss the fact that they have a pretty good selection of bottled beer to go with the 5 or 6 beers on tap.  The food is not exceptional but good bar food and very cheap.  The wings are delicious.  My main complaint is the staff, they are somewhat friendly but tend to forget about you while they wrap themselves up with whatever friends have stopped by to visit the bar.  You might sit there for 6-8 drinks and have great service and then poof, the bartenders disappear to go hang out with their buddies and you don't see them for 20 mins.  My other complaint with the staff is they can't really answer any questions about what they have, for instance if you ask if they have a porter they give you a strange look and then run through what they have on tap a few times.  The bartenders don't really know what various kinds of beers are which can be frustrating if you're looking for something in particular.",

Don't get me wrong it's a cool spot, majority of the staff is attentive and food is okay for pub food but holy crap Brian \"the manager\" is the absolute worse! On a busy Saturday I started my tab( with my card) for two beers and an app when my husband went to go close the tab they asked him to pay for it and he assumed I didn't leave my card. It's all good that stuff happens, I called Sunday, told them what happened, told them that my husband paid it and they said that's fine yet they still charges my card. I go up there to get my card and tell them they still charged it and they said well where's his receipt ( yet they never told me to bring his receipt ) I told them I didn't have it, I wasn't told to bring it and Brian said I'd have to bring the receipt and he started walking away, a confrontation happened he walked away was the extremely rude when I asked for manager or owners information he said he didn't know anything. All in all what I'm upset about isn't the double charging and them not giving my card to my husband bc let's face it there a business and stuff happens but Brian being so rude and walking away ( which I'm sugar coating ) was what led me to leave a review. So with all that said, yes this is a cool place but the manager is an a** and be careful with leaving a tab open here, check your bank account :/",

The only drawback to this place is the area around the bar is not very big - kinda long and skinny so trying to make your way to the restrooms at one end of the bar is kind of a sneak & squeeze through the crowd type of game.   *The best tip about this place: there is usually a ton of open street parking nearby",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times and plan on coming back again.  It's got a very casual easy going vibe without being too divey.  Menu has most of the typical bar fare with some interesting twists like calamari sticks.  But I have to point a few shortcomings. - Twice I've ordered wings and despite the place not being super busy they both took over a half hour to come out.  Wings were decent and meat enough but wings should never take more than 20 minutes.  At least they apologized both times. - Most staff is very friendly and attentive but when I've gone when its not super busy bartenders seemed to spending more time chatting amongst each other and checking on their phones than seeing whether everything was okay. Not that you can't have some fun especially when things are slow but don't want to as a customer feel like I'm being an inconvenience. - Needs more staff as some staff pulls double duty running food and serving drinks, made more challenging by the fact the kitchen is in lower half of the bar while the upper half of the  bar is the busier part. Definitely check it out if you're looking to avoid the more crowded and pricey bars around the Epicenter but just be aware it may not be the perfect experience.  But the effort is there at least.",

Definitely recommend going here.",

Plenty of TVs, great drink specials every day, and pretty solid bar food.  I'm a huge fan of their wings. They're always fresh and they make all their sauces. I don't think you can go wrong with a flavor here, so go off your own personal preference. You can also order all flats or all drums for $1 more per 10. Check them out on Mondays for wing night, $15 wings for $10. My friend Ashley loves their mozzarella sticks. Why is fried cheese so damn delicious?   Trivia on Tuesdays. This is also a great spot for darts. Bartenders are all solid and can sling some drinks.",

We came here Sunday evening for an early dinner to meet up with some friends, and ended up sitting outside at one of their metal tables. I ordered wings and a side of pretzel bites, The Lady ordered Nachos, and our friends shared wings as well (dry rub). Dry rub wings usually aren't my thing, but I actually think I enjoyed them more than I did mine! The pretzel bites were good but I think the salt was tossed on a little too late, as a lot was left behind in the paper. The cheese was on point though. You know, it's a small neighborhood bar and they have above average food, and the location can't be beat at all. For a really casual meal, I'll return in an instant. Plus their beer selection is fantastic.",

We didn't have to wait long for drinks and the food also came out fairly quickly.   The special was miller light and corona light buckets. Our Jameson pickle back shots were $7, not bad.
