Not only is the food great, the service is impeccable. I can't remember a time that I ever had an empty glass of water or an empty plate ready to be taken from the table for more than a minute. Food levels in the pans are also closely monitored by staff so they are never out of anything.  It gets slammed at lunch so I usually come when they first open.  When are we getting an Uptown location???",

The actually curry tasted all right.  However, the \"meat\" was nothing but bones, fats, and tendons.  I am not the type of person to who would freak out over finding one bone in my dish, it happens.  The problem comes when I ordered goat curry and there was actually only on small bite of meat in the dish with the rest being bones and random other bits.  If they where running low on actual goat meat and had to make due they could have given me a call and I could have ordered something else.",

I bit into it, and all I could taste was the old grease it had been sitting in.  2. The Basmati rice was OK... , but it didn't have the flavorful aroma of basmati- and a bit heavily seasoned with cumin. Definitely NOT cooked properly.... AND it was packed in a Chinese takeout box....  3.The Naan was decent  4. The spinach and potato dish I'm very fond of, had a VERY distinctive sweet taste immediately followed by spices. Not impressed- 5. My lamb vindaloo was good.   Overall... I won't be back. But I can understand  students craving Indian food loving this place.",

A yogurt dish with garlic and a variety of savory spices was also excellent.

    "text": "I enjoyed the meal for the most part, but it definitely didn't quell my Indian food cravings. I was left rather confused.  I got : Veg samosas, minimal complaints (the tamarind sauce and mint chutney had the consistency of water) Malai kofta curry -medium spicy. This is what confused me - why on earth was the sauce sweet?? It tasted like they poured a bunch of sugar into it which I've never experienced. - perhaps that's because they also specialize in Indo-Chinese cuisine and that influence has made it's way into their curry? The Chinese in the South is notorious for being way too sweet... please don't let this affect all the Indian restaurants in Charlotte or I will be forced to move back to San Francisco.  Garlic naan- it was okay Veg Pualo - this was pretty good, something I never tried before Gobi Mancurian - I loved the sauce - probably should stick to only ordering it in house though, was pretty soggy by the time it got here.",

If you eat dinner here, try the bhindi masala. It's kinda an okra stew, which I would have thought sounded gross, but it's so good! My other favorite is the chicken tikka masala.   For dessert try the rice kheer- sweetened rice in coconut milk, or galub jamon- fried cheese balls that don't taste very cheesy, soaked in a sweet syrup.",

I recently moved to a new area and tried to find a new Indian restaurant. None of them could stand up to this one. Now, at least three times a month, I make the 20-minute trip back to passage of India to get lunch from my favorite Indian restaurant. Even if I don't sit down to eat, they offer a lunch box where you can get two items, rice and naan for around $7. A great deal for even better food. If you go for dinner be sure to go to their website and print off a coupon first. It's always great to save money.",

    "text": "One of the worst staff with attitude and worst service. The slim guy in the specs is filled with ego and pride with an audacity to argue with customers. We ordered 2 goat dum biryanis to go. And this is what we heard on the phone - \"Your order will be ready in 35 minutes Sir\". We reach the place after 40 minutes and the guy says it'll take a few more minutes. We wait for another 10 minutes outside the restaurant. That's when I start getting angry. But finally after 50 minutes, the order is ready. The only thing I tell the guy with the specs is that if you say 35 minutes, please try and make sure that it is ready in 35 minutes. He first argues that we ordered at 1:40 PM. I asked him to see the time and it was 2:31 PM. He said sure and me and my friends go sit in the car about to start driving back home. The guy has the audacity to come out to the parking lot and start arguing that goat dum biryani takes a lot of time, and he had said \"About 35 minutes\" on the phone and not just 35 minutes. So basically he is trying to say that his \"ABOUT\" 35 minutes has a buffer of +/- 15 minutes. Such ego is not good for business and I'm surprised that a staff member can have such audacity to talk to customers like that. They need to understand that even 3 Michelin star restaurants have a cut off time of 30 minutes for an order. Or at least they'll tell the correct amount of time required.   First of all we have to have the greasy food that these people make, and on top of that we have to bear such humiliating behavior from the staff. All I can say is that they just lost good customers.  I wouldn't even give 1 star but that's the minimum one can give.",

I went to another restaurant earlier and was so hooked, I searched for another spot and came across this one. I've been eating here 1-2 times a week since the summer of 2017 and order the same thing each time, chicken makanni ( spelling is incorrect) w/ rice and spring rolls which comes to $16 each time. You calculate that each week 1-2 times a week, it's pretty costly.  The food is great but the service is awful every time unless Andy, the manager isn't there. I work as a Small Business Consultant and I'm big on respect, treating individuals the same and etc. I had several complaints to Andy regarding not giving me the same portion(s) each time, with prices and etc. It got to the point I came so much Andy would give me a discount w/o me asking or looking for it. Each time I go there and he's not there, I get an awful experience.  My last visit was 2 weeks ago and I asked to speak with Andy and they said he was too busy and was in the back in the kitchen. I personally left my business card for him w/ my personal cell number asking him to give me a call and follow up based on my experiences. I never once got a call or anyone that contacted me so I will no longer go to them. I don't believe in spending my hard earned money and give it to someone that doesn't value or appreciate your business. I too am a business owner and whether I'm at work or tending to my business, I treat each client of mine with the same upmost respect. I WILL NOW TRY PEACOCK located in the University area or find another Indian restaurant.",

We came here for the weekend buffet, the little place was crowded...a good sign since quite a few of the patrons were Indian themselves. The buffet selection was also good, they even had a pani puri station, seemed cool. I grabbed quite a few things but all were mediocre. I think what got me was the paneer tikka masala..I ate some (my bf didn't touch it) and in my head told myself..hey this isn't the right texture for tikka masala..something's off...and then 6 hours later I was barfing my guts out for the following 24 hours.   I'm sure this was an off day as my bf and his room mates have eaten here many times before. Sadly, I don't think I'll be eating here ever again, I'm basically scarred for life. The buffet is large and cheap..but considering my experience you may want to stick to the a la carte menu.   Good luck.",

Most Indian buffets have butter chicken on the menu, or some mild chicken curry dish most would like. A Passage India did not have my favorite dish, but they had chicken dish called Chicken makhani. Superb! The Naan was soft and delicious. Even the rice dessert was the best I have ever had.   The only thing I don't like is the fact there is no parking during the week at lunch. If you do find parking, the spots are too narrow. Don't bring your most expensive car. Your doors will get hit.   You will love this place if you love Indian food!",

    "text": "My previous roommate took me to Passage to India almost two years ago and I was exceptionally impressed with the quality of food. Who cares about decor when you're getting the best Indian cuisine in the area? Much like that favorite diner in a small town or that hole in the wall in a city, it's a gem. If you go to a place like that and it's almost always packed and not a chain restaurant, you know it has to be good.  I didn't make it back too often, but I found a menu I grabbed the first time I was there in my delivery box today. They deliver within a 5 mile radius and I count myself exceptionally lucky that I live within it.  I ordered the Eelam Calamari ( I LOVE calamari) and it was actually better than my favorite Greek style. Also, I ordered the assorted bread basket  with enough variety and naan to last me a week. The Hydrabadi Keema (Minced lamb cooked in an authentic mogul style with fresh spices) was outstanding.  I've never ordered delivery service from them, but it was perfect. 25 minutes for steaming hot, perfectly prepared food that in NO way disappoints. You can also order online. I have no idea why I didn't know they delivered sooner! I was always disappointed in my delivery options in the University area, until now. No more settling for Domino's or Wing Zone when I'm too tired to cook. Between that and the International Market nearby, I can safely say I no longer have to eat crappy, unhealthy, tasteless food when I'm desperate and exhausted, but hungry. Passage to India is amazing.  Also, if you're not afraid of (or thoroughly enjoy, like me) spicy food, get the Hydrabadi Keema spicy. Perfection.",

The lassi was good, had some ground pistachios in it. The masala dosa was definitely sub-par.   One of the rare places we've been to where most food was left uneaten AND we did not take any home. I think that says it all. Service is OK, if you plan to go there.",

We decided to give the restaurant another shot on a second trip two months later.  The second time, everything was delicious, more than we expected.  We ordered Palak Paneer (Cheese in Spinach Gravy), Dal Fry (Cooked Lentil), Bhindi Masala (Okra cooked in spices) and Spicy Cheese Masal Dosa.  The Dosa was unbelievable, crispy-juicy-hearty-delicious. And Chili Naan, if you like spicy, this is something you don't want to miss.  We regretted so much not being able to finish all of the dishes but I had to fly back to California the next morning and could not take the leftover's back to the hotel.  The waiter (seemed to be an owner?) actually remembered us from our previous visit.  He specifically remembered my boss's preference for certain foods, this impressed us even more.  I am looking forward to eating at Passage To India when I get back to Charlotte.",

Free paper dosas brought to the table as you sit.  10 bucks is a little high, but worth the variety of flavor and freshness of grub.

Of course it was our first time there so we didn't really know much of how the procedure and process of the restaurant works. Apparently, we went in the afternoon because they were still serving their lunch buffet yet we wanted to order from the menu since I've checked few reviews about it. It took them a few minutes longer than average restaurant to give us the menu and take our order, including bringing our drinks. So let's cut to the chase, I couldn't order what I wanted because it was lunch time and that was the whole purpose going there; therefore, my girlfriend and I shared her entree and appetizer. Overall, the food was pretty good and different. The water had little ice and by the time it was refilled, all the ice had melted away already (like really, no kidding). Service wasn't the worse but had an unwelcoming environment. I'll give it another try (next year).",

I'm a big spicy fanatic so when I had tried the Chicken Marsala it was incredible. There was so much flavor and I've never ordered something where the spice level was actually catered to my liking. Putting the Marsala on the Naan is probably the ultimate combo.   Overall, I was really happy with my takeout.

    "text": "My husband and I was craving some tasty Indian food. We saw the ratings on Yelp and Google and decided to give it a try. As we entered the restaurant we were both greeted and was immediately seated.   There was a few people at this time, which was around 530 pm. The atmosphere was warm and friendly and the seating was comfortable. Seating options include tables and booths. We sat on a booth.  The menu had a huge selection of appetizers, meat, and vegetarian dishes. I was also surprised to see a selection of asian food like egg rolls and fried rice. We were also given some sort of flat bread with dipping sauce. It has an interesting taste and my four year-old actually liked it.  We ended up ordering two lambs samosas, chicken tika masala, chana masala, plain nan, and egg fried rice. Our entrees came with basmate rice. The food was served in beautiful silver dishes and the amount off food given was excellent. Not only was the food tasty to look at but was also delicious and full of flavor..we tasted all the spices.   Over all, I am giving this place a solid 5 star because the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. You will definitely dance to the wonderful flavors or India without breaking your wallet. We will be coming back to try the buffet..",

    "text": "As an absolute novice to Indian cuisine, I had always been a little hesitant to try it out because I wasn't sure I would be able to stomach the spices. Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the flavors and the dishes I ordered at Passage to India.  I tried this place thanks to a suggestion of my best friend who works nearby and asked me to join her for a Friday evening dinner. Passage to India is situated in a tiny strip mall right down the street from UNCC (aka my alma mater, go 49ers!) and is quite small inside so the place can fill up quite quickly. I joined my friend around 6:30 p.m. and walked right in with no wait.  For my beverage, I ordered the mango juice which was pure, delicious mango puree and the vegetable samosas as an appetizer. The samosas were brought out nice and hot and served with two different dipping sauces. One was green which had more of a cilantro flavor and the other was brown which was on the sweeter side. Forgive me, as I have no idea of the \"official\" names for the sauces.  I didn't have the chance to look over their menu online before I visited so I relied on the knowledge and preferences of my friend to walk me through the menu possibilities. I would personally recommend checking out the online menu before you go because it can be a bit overwhelming especially if you're an Indian food newbie. I settled on the chicken tikka masala which is grilled chicken breast cooked with tomato creamy sauce and served with basmati rice. My friend ordered the tandoori chicken. I have to rave here: THEY WERE BOTH DELICIOUS. My taste buds were so relieved!  Our waiters varied throughout our meal but all were so kind and accommodating and checked in to make sure we were satisfied with our meals. As a newly-minted Indian food fan, I am happy to have a place to recommend and cannot wait to come back to try their highly talked about lunch buffet.",

The restaurant is conveniently located near the university and residential area which I stayed near.  My food was hot and carefully packaged.   I hope they will have Indian style rice packaging versus the Chinese rice boxes in the future. Tee hee.  They have amazing prices so I got a good meal under $15.  I ordered the butter naan, chicken bhuna, carrot hawla, and got the gulab jamun with the yelp special for free.  The servings was enough for two people.  The carrot hawla needed more sugar and the gulab James was a little soggy but both still enjoyable. BI will come back.  It may be too tight to eat inside as business was steady and parking was tight too.",

Now if your looking for ambience this is not for you, go to The Blue Taj in Ballantyne. The interior reminds me of a Chinese take out place, not much to look at. But the food is tasty. I haven't tried their lunch buffet but have been to dinner here. I like that you can change up the spice level, although when I ordered a level 5 of 5 I was dissapointed by the lack of heat. But the food is flavorful. The have onion bhajis which I love, and also onion chutney....mmmm I love it on some nice warm naan bread.

No server showed up, no menu placed down... I looked around and saw a buffet, I wasnt sure if that was the only option?  (Its my first time here and no one informed me of anything).  Or if I was to wait forever until I received a menu?  Either way- this place I ventured out to wasn't worth my business.

I have not had much Indian food before so the buffet was perfect for me - I got to sample the different dishes/sauces.",

My advice stay safe by ordering only Indian foods that is very difficult to screw up even by a monkey . Means if it has tasted good in frozen u get from store these guys can make it as well . Anything authentic you wish to try this is big let down . I ordered chicken chettinad . Where is the curry leaf . Where is the tarka . It tasted like a bad jalfrezi . If you don't know what you are selling don't put it on list . Iam pissed because I drove 10 miles to have this food because of review . The veg biryani . Horrible . It's not biryani. Delivering it in a handi with top covered by dum makes it only fancy . The actual thing inside is horrible . Pardon if the words are harsh . We left it as it is . I haven't written a review for so long .  It iam absolutely disappointed today .",

We were out shopping for things to make our new home more livable and decided to drive by UNCC where I taught in the 1970's when we spotted Passage to India. We were glad we did. We arrived around noon and participated in their lunch buffet. The buffet had all of our favorites - Veg Pakora, Palak Paneer, Chana Saag, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhani and a couple of Biryanis among other things. All were perfectly spiced for an American clientele, not too mild but not overly spicy. The Saag was very good as was the Paneer. The Masala was flavorful and had plenty of chicken. We definitely will take this passage again for dinner.",

The dessert that Yelp advertised as being a part of the check-in was a fake because one of the waiters told me that the offer would only work for dinner time. Overall, it was an ok place to eat, but I felt rushed to get out of their because they were cleaning under my feet while eating, and anyone born in the South knows (that is bad luck). I would like to attempt to eat here again when they are not closing for dinner maybe it is better then.

Everything was good and moderately spicy (i'm not a spicy food person but I found everything to have a tolerable level of spice). Service was good. 2 of us ate for $25! I would return.     Long version: I was not expecting for Saturday to be strictly a buffet day but I soon realized that was the case because we were sat with no menus (around 1pm) and there were no menus to be seen anywhere.     About 3 different members of staff asked us for our drink order within 3 minutes so even though communication amongst them wasn't great, they each saw a table with no drinks and took it upon themselves to ask what we wanted; I appreciate that.    I would love to tell you the names of what I ate specifically but aside from naan, basmati rice, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala, I honestly have no idea what I ate. I can tell you that it was all delicious. Though it was spicy enough to make my nose run a bit, it wasn't unbearable and didn't require me to drink copious amounts of fluids to put out the fire.    This buffet was very busy and people would stand outside to wait for their turn to be seated (the entrance has no room whatsoever for people to wait, as a matter of fact, someone may bump you with the door as you are standing at the entrance to pay).     It was nice that the patrons were very diverse. If people of all backgrounds are coming to it, you can bet the food is worth it.    Oh, get there early because there isn't a ton of seating so you might have to wait if you show up after 1pm. Also, they close between to 2:30-5:00pm so you'll miss your chance until the evening.",

    "text": "The Passage to India lunch buffet never fails to satiate my curry and tandoori fix and their mixed up lunch buffet has kept me happily coming back here for about 2 years.  No one is going to say this is the best Indian food that you'll ever eat, but, the prices are very reasonable and food is worth returning for.  If you've never had Indian food before the lunch buffet is a cheap and yummy way to see what you like.  TIP: UNCC students show your ID for 10% off. A bunch buffet comes out to less than $7 for all you can eat. Where is this, Vegas? Just show me the slot machine!  After two years of ethnographic observation, I think I cracked the Indian Buffet Code. In general the buffet consists of something like this:  Carbs: - Pyaz Pakora: crispy deep fried onions. Yummy - White rice with peas - Fried vegetable rice - Butter Naan and Garlic Naan  Then about 3 or 4 vegetable curries, such as - Something beany: Channa masala, Dal - Something greeny: Saag Paneer, Aloo Gobi Palak - Something creamy: Paneer Tikki Masala, Shai Paneer - Spiced Cabbage(y): I can never eat enough this  And then about three Chicken dishes (with a Lamb mixed in there sometimes too): - Tandoori chicken - Chicken Tikki Masala - Chicken Saag - Butter Chicken Masala  Dessert- about 1 or 2 of the following: - Rice Kheer  - Gulab Jamun - Sliced fruit (oranges, watermelon)  With the variety and consist quality, I'll be coming back here as long as I am a student at UNCC!",

    "text": "A True gem in the University area. There have been other Indian restaurants in the area and none of them can compete with this one. For lunch they have a buffet with a number of dishes to suit any taste including vegan and vegetarian. The buffet is on a rotation so some of the dishes change from day to day. Since it is a buffet I think they do not make the food as spicy so many people can enjoy it. Be careful, the food is so good you may accidentally eat way too much. For food this good you may expect to pay a lot but two people can get the buffet for $15 (or $10 if you get the takeout special). If you are unsure what dishes you would enjoy, go for the weekend \"brunch\" buffet. It is larger than the weekday buffet and includes some of their other Asian dishes as well. I have gone for the lunch buffet many times and have never had problems with the food (except when they can't keep up!), it has never tasted bad or been cold.   They also have a large dinner menu which you can preview on their website and they even deliver. Of course the dinner menu is more expensive but they give large portions. I usually order butter chicken, vegetable biryani, and naan for dinner and have enough leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.  The dining room is rather small, around 15 tables, so if you go during a peak time expect to wait (but it's worth it!). The decor is simple and tasteful and the place is always clean. The waiters are very attentive and polite.  FInally a personal remark about the last time I was there... I used to go here at least once a week since I lived in the area. I have been away for a year and when we went back the other day the waiter remembered me! Even though I don't live as close as I used to I will go back as often as I can now that I'm back in Charlotte.  I hope this review has been helpful and convinces you to try Passage to India. Great places like this deserve the support of their community!",

I don't know what it is about the University area and great Indian food, but this is definitely the best around. The malai kofta is always my favorite. Chicken tikka masala, paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh naan, and there's always something new to try. Fresh gulab jamun too for dessert which is delicious. We usually go to the lunch buffett on Saturday which is always slamming. It can be very crowded at times, just be patient, everyone is very friendly and just wants to get down with some good food, especially hungry college students!",

Let me rephrase that, when I smell... maybe that isn't the right word to use...  let's just say: when I experience it.  Despite that I do not like the smell of Currie and most Indian food looks unsightly to me, there is something to be said about the food here.  It is cooked well and has a certain richness being full of the unique complexities you might expect in well prepared Indian food.  I have had bad Indian food before: dry, bland or grossly over seasoned and spiced but you will only find good food here.  On my visit, my friends and I ordered sampler platters that featured a variety of different Indian dishes.  We only ordered two samplers for the four of us but so much food came out that they had to slide an extra table over to accommodate it all.  I feel we really got more than our money's worth eating here.  As for the environment, it is really nothing special.  The decor is sparse and the furnishings are dated and low budget.  Don't go expecting Taj Mahal surroundings, you will get far more enjoyment if you focus on the food and your good company.",

    "text": "Great Indian food.  We had the lunch buffet, and to drink Masala tea and mango lassi.  The food was superb.  The buffet turnover was extremely high, with new food served every few minutes.  The vegetable biriyani, goat biriyani, tandoori chicken, tikka chicken, and chicken tikki masala were all great.  The naan was crispy and the gulab jamun was par for the course.  The tea was almost certainly not from a powder, and the mango lassi differed from what I was used to by having chopped pistachios in it.  The nuts added a sense of depth and texture I have not yet seen in other mango lassi.  The dessert bar had rice pudding along with a host of unrecognizable desserts.  Absent were the expected fruit cocktail, jello, and ice cream offered at \"cheaper\" buffets.  Instead there were interesting mixes of chick peas, almonds, and other presumably homemade desserts.  I will update this review once I try their dinner menu.  Pros:  - Inexpensive.  Lunch buffet for $10 a person is great. - Food is freshly made for a buffet and turnover is high. - Wait staff is friendly and keeps the drinks filled.  Cons:  - There were a lot of indian customers, which I take to be a sign that the food is legit and authentic.  However the wait staff did not have a set uniform or nametags.  They were for the most part dressed casually.  It was difficult to determine who worked for Passage to India and who was a customer.  - After eating the lunch buffet, I had the worst food coma I've ever had post lunch.  The food here is heavy.  Be prepared to take a long afternoon nap after eating at Passage to India.",

I try to avoid buffets, but this place has an amazing buffet that I just can't resist. The restaurant has a nice quiet atmosphere and is well maintained. The staff is awesome, really polite and attentive.  The food is ridiculous. The curries are flavorful and there is a wide variety. Usually there are 4-5 veggie based curries and 2 chicken based curries. There's nothing quite like mixing delicious chicken tikka masala with jasmine rice and rolling it up in garlic naan. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Not to mention the tandoori chicken that's always on point.  The best part of all, it's affordable. The lunch buffet is only 7-8 dollars!

I find it overly refreshing that the men always take the opportunity to open the door for the women. I know it may sound cheesy, but it's just a really nice touch. The food is spicy to please most tastebuds, but not gimme a beer to kill the heat spicy. I'm always left with the best food coma feeling.",

The only disappointment was that the food was a bit cold by the time it arrived, however it is a bit chilly outside today.  It would have been nice if the restaurant took measures to ensure the food remained hot by the time it reached.  All in all cant complain, I will definitely order again.",

They serve your meal family-style, which I think is fun. One word of warning: 'mild' 'medium' and 'spicy' are not quite comparable to Mexican food, and if you think you like hot, order medium! But to tame the heat, you can order a lassie (yogurt drink) or the waiter may feel sorry for you and bring you some yogurt sauce! Anyways, I highly recommend this restaurant. Happy eating!",

The restaurant itself is pretty small and decor is minimal but the place is clean. Maybe a bit tight when busy but it was at about 3/4 capacity during lunch today. A bit of confusion when we got there, our drink orders were taken and we did indeed want the buffet but our server didn't really tell us anything regarding the buffet. We finally took a cue from the other tables and made our way to the buffet ourselves.  The slight disappointment that there was no Chicken Tikka Masala was quickly forgotten about with the plentiful options on the buffet today. I feel silly for not remembering what it was called, but all the way on the far left of the buffet in front of the curried chicken, was chicken with a similar masala sauce but arguably better chicken! Went back for some of that three times! Basmati rice was perfectly cooked, fragrant, slightly nutty, outstanding.  Our server didn't say much at all but kept the drinks full and cleared out plated frequently. For the price I can't argue at all!  What was once just a take-out joint for me is now a solid dine-in option. What a great hidden gem!",

I've been desperately craving Indian food after being in Vietnam for 2.5 weeks, and decided to fire up yelp for some help. Once again yelp community, you do not disappoint! With over 20 different items on their buffet, I HAD to try everything. And then, of course, I had to go back for my favorites. It's literally been over 24 hours and I am still stuffed! The dishes were intense and flavorful, exactly what is expected of an Indian restaurant.. and all for $10.99! I also learned that you could get a to-go box with a rice and 2 curries for either $5 (vegetarian) or $6 (non-vegetarian). Now, how do I get them to open another restaurant near work..?   The restaurant is fairly quaint and stayed packed the whole time I was there with constant lines out the door. I was pretty excited about snagging my plates before the table of 10 went up for their share lol Just to put into perspective how delicious this place is, I didn't even THINK about taking pictures until after we left because I, apparently, just inhaled my meal. I'm basically going to live here now. Thank you yelp for another yummy discovery!",

For under 20 bucks it comes with a soft drink,  choice of appetizer, choice of curry Biryani and choice of dessert.  Can't beat that.  The vegetable samosa's were on point.  Best I've had.  The Biryani was also tasty.  I got the fried cheese balls for dessert.  They were done well also.  This place is popular.  On a Sunday night there were several parties of 10+ people.  The service staff did an OK job pacing the meal, though it took longer to get our bill then I would have liked.  The only negative, my family (not me) got the special Indian spiced tea.  It came with milk.  Not advertised but OK.  It came with loose tea leaves in it,  OK.  Not a huge big deal,  BUT the milk used had been scalded and caused a funky film on the cup and it just didn't taste right per my family.  Oh well, I'm rounding up...4.5 stars....  I'll be back.  They are a little too far for takeout, but I'll definitely keep them in mind when I want a good Indian restaurant north of the city.",

If you want cheap dirty food, not fresh delicious food, then just go to a $9 chinese buffet where they have a lot of \"meat\" for you. Or how about be fancy like me, spend only $2 more and get the chicken chettinad. It has a lot of chicken meat and can literally feed 2 people. Hands down the best curry dish I've had, I am very satisfied, 5/5. Chicken is tender and soft, not tough to chew. The curry, oh boy, is so finger licking good. First time I had it, my eyes were closed the entire time while my wife was spoon feeding me. It felt like I just spent a million dollars on this dish for it to be this delicious. It is spicy enough to kick up your taste bud, then a lil bit of sourness kicks in, after that it leaves you with a hint of fresh curry leaves and tomatoes puree. The complexity of this dish, in terms of taste, is unbelievable.",

I used to live in Charlotte, and when I visit Charlotte:  I always visit, my Mom, Dad, brother's, sisters, In-laws, and Passage to India. Some times all at the same time if I am lucky.  Andy has done a great job, I know he has been there since 2011 at least, and he has come a long way, the first time I met Andy I believe it was at Bombay cuisine an upscale Indian restaurant that I never really ate at, I did some wholesale deliveries there.   What Andy has done for Charlotte, was made the best Indian Buffet, and made it available to the masses. I am perfectly comfortable with the prices, and it is well worth paying the extra for the weekend buffet. I am always sure to stop by and visit him when I am in Charlotte.  Things I like on the buffet:  Gulab Jamon (Usually Weekend) Rice Pudding  Chilli Gobi Gobi fish (Weekend) Tandoori Chicken Butter Chicken anything Naan  Not going to lie, I don't know all the dishes by name, but I eat it and love it. I remember another reviewer mentioning a paneer dish. Definitely need to get that on your plate too.  I usually come for the lunch buffet, as I am more of a budget/binge Indian eater.",

That's typically why I avoid them...they're usually not that appealing. However, Passage to India is a True exception to this rule of mine.   The buffet is pretty banging. Not only is it (and the restaurant) quite clean and tidy, but you'll spy a nice selection of items. Fresh paneers, tikka masala, rice, two types of naan, fresh salads, and more. All of these items look to be frequently refreshed and judging by the full tables, this fab buffet is no secret. For just $7.50 per person (weekday) you can gorge on gorge Indian east. Some of my favorites included...  Tikka masala: Tender chunks of chicken swimming in a perfectly tomatoey sauce with a touch of cream  Cucumber, tomato and onion salad: Crisp and refreshing with bits of cilantro  Garlic naan: Hot and delightful. There's buttered naan if you prefer!   And for those who prefer their food to go, Passage to India offers a pretty sweet deal: $3.99 for a vegetarian lunch box and $4.99 for a chicken lunch box. Those University area folks have it made here!",

    "text": "Passage to India is a fairly new Indian restaurant in the University area.  Unfortunately, Udipi (the vegetarian restaurant) has closed down and Passage to India took its place.  It features a full menu as well as a weekday lunch buffet and a weekend brunch buffet that serves a couple more items than the regular weekday buffet like specialties from South India and a selection of popular street foods and of course vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian fare.  My family decided to try their weekend buffet, as a way to sample their style of cooking.  The interior: simple, clean.  Service: polite  Price: $9.95 for weekend and $7 something for weekday, menu prices are varied but they have a $3.99, $4.99 and $6.99 bento box type special everyday.  The buffet is served until 3:30 pm, however they refill the buffet trays for the last time at around 2:30 (when we arrived) so we kinda had to try the leftover and dry-ish food.  I didnt expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was Amazing!  I tried to sample a bite of everything, but that was very hard because everything was so good, I wanted to cram my mouth with it.  Even my mom - who never likes restaurant food, ate everything on her plate and praised it to bout!  The amazing Iron Chef-India praised someone else's food!  WOW must've been good :)  Ok, so I tried 2 of the 4 types of rice dishes, which were very flavorful but not overpowering.  I tried the spinach/paneer dumplings in a creamy sauce, boneless tandoori chicken--they have the bone-in tandoori chicken too but since we were so late coming in, we didnt get any :(  chilli chicken which is something everyone should try cause it was really good.  The star of the buffet table was the Indo-Chinese style noodles.  They were so good, it made me wish I had an extra stomach to I could keep eating it!  When I go back, that and the chili chicken is all Im saving my stomach space for.  I even tried the dosa, idli (rice cakes) with coconut chutney and sambar.  They were all good, in fact really good and I cant wait for our next trip down University City Blvd.    I took some pictures with my iPhone, so I will be posting those as well, please excuse the poor lighting or angles.  Overall, great brunch/lunch but my only regret is coming in so late, cause we missed out on a True 5 star rating meal.",

That said, Passage has solid, delicious Indian food that definitely satisfies a craving.   I came here on a Saturday evening around 4pm for a very late \"lunch\". Boyfriend and I were seated quickly and service was friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is...bland. Its a small restaurant with only a handful of tables, and the decor is limited. Luckily, we weren't there for the environmental aesthetic - we were there for some garam masala and curry!  I ordered the chicken tikka masala because I know what I like and not much else. The boyfriend is always more adventurous and got some type of goat dish. Our food came out quickly and looked fantastic. My meal was delicious and I heard that the goat was, as well.  I didn't eat any of the naan, but I could tell from a glance that it was probably not on the same caliber as what we got at Copper. It looked like frozen naan that you could buy at the grocery store. My boyfriend said that it was fine and did the job, but certainly did not taste homemade.   Overall, I'm thrilled to have another solid Indian option in a neighborhood that I frequent. Passage to India is no-frills, inexpensive, hot, fresh Indian cuisine, and that's all we were looking for!",

The wait for my food was around ~20 minutes, and all the waiters/staff were very friendly. Brownie points for having a smaller menu of completely vegan options!  I ordered the malai kofta, which really should be called kofta tikka masala as the sauce is more like what one would have in a traditional paneer or chicken tikka masala than it is like malai kofta itself. Still, the gravy was flavorful and so was the kofta, which is exactly what I was looking for in a comfort food. I wasn't very hungry, so I got boxes for what I didn't finish.  I also noticed--since I was sitting near the front of the restaurant--that a lot of people during the ~45 minutes I was here came to pick up phone or online orders, which is a testament to this place's local popularity. However, almost 100% of those orders were not ready when people came to pick them up.  So, in summary: the food is good, the service is great, but be prepared to wait!",

    "text": "Where to begin?! First time ordering from here, called in my order for pickup and that was a breeze. The person who took my order was very helpful. We ordered the lamb rogan josh, chicken Manchurian, butter naan, basmati rice and vegetable samosas. Everything was DELICIOUS! I don't have any pictures because we ate everything!!! I especially fell in love with the lamb dish, it was spoon tender not fork tender but, SPOON tender and super flavorful. The butter naan was the best I've ever eaten. I'm super happy we gave this place a try.   As my husband was leaving from picking up the order he was approached by a young man asking if my husband could purchase him something to eat from the establishment, said he was hungry. The staff came outside to see if all was okay and upon discovering the young man was hungry, led him in and sat him down to feed him. You don't find kindness like that in this world very often. My husband offered to pay for the meal but, the restaurant said they will feed him no problem. They sat him at a table and proceeded to take his order. They've earned my utmost respect just from that considerate act.   Great service, delicious food, and showing decency towards those in need. What more could you ask for in an establishment? We will definitely be back!",

The smell of the fresh Na'an made me feel like I was back in India, like the summer of 2013, in my exchange's home. The owner and Chef also made the experience more personal by checking on us. They were hospitable.   You can either dine in or order to go. There were  to-go orders literally except minute. I also discovered they have a buffet. I've got to come back to check it out. I'd rate this as my second best if its kind in Charlotte.",

My two favorite dishes are the Kadai Bhindi and the Aloo Palak. Also their naan is delicious, and they have some fried onion straw things that are a must-have.

Walked in, and the place was full of smelly Indians.  Good sign.  While I don't enjoy the rank B.O., these Fresh Off the Boat MoFos likely know where the real deal is for curry.    Service was good.  Food was great.  Well executed across the board.  We ordered 5 different dishes and all were very good.  Not overly spicy.  And, unlike most Indian restaurants, it wasn't overly heavy or greasy.  I felt good afterwards and didn't feel like I'd just consumed 3,000 calories of grease.    And the next morning... WHOA!!!  The stench that emanated from my ass was truly breathtaking.  By that, I mean that others around me were having difficulty breathing.  Passage to India found a Passage right out of my ass in violent fashion.  My bathroom stunk for hours from this wonderful curry spice!  That alone is reason to go back.",

    "text": "Having just hit my 10-year anniversary living in the Charlotte area, I've come to the sad conclusion that there simply aren't very many good Indian restaurants in the area.  There are quite a few in number, but none of them have really ever bowled me over.  This changed after dining at Passage to India on a cold Friday night.  It is an unassuming restaurant in a strip mall in the University area of Charlotte.  Sharing its location with a head shop, a supplement store, and a chain pizza place, you wouldn't think you'd struck gold until the food starts coming.  We started with onion bhaji, which are basically onion fritters.  These came with a tamarind chutney and a cilantro chutney as dipping sauces.  The fritters were perfectly fried, not greasy, and must have come right out of the frying basket because they were nice and piping hot.  Salted well with an excellent crunch, the generous portion size was a welcome beginning to our meal.  For my entree, I got lamb biryani.  This has become my go-to dish because it just checks all the boxes for me.  Protein, fat, and carbs in one delicious application?  Sign me up.  It was served in a deep metal bowl that disguised just how much food they give you.  Topped with cashews, diced tomatoes, and cilantro, this was the best biryani I've had yet.  I asked for it \"very spicy\" and despite a pensive look from the gentleman serving us, they did not disappoint.  The rice was perfectly seasoned and coated with whatever magical mix of spices they use.  The cardamom added a welcome floral aroma and flavor, and the lamb was not only perfectly tender and delicious, but the dish must have been half lamb by weight.  It was utterly delicious and I got two full meals out of it.  My wife got the UK's national dish, chicken tikka masala.  I tried exactly one cube of perfectly moist and tender chicken, and a spoonful of the gravy.  It was sweet, rich, tangy, and full of flavor.  It had less of an artificial orange color as I've seen from other places, and tasted quite homemade...in the best way possible.  Her dish came with some raita, but I didn't happen to try that.  No meal is complete without bread so we got a basket of assorted breads.  You can have any kind of bread you'd like, as long as it's naan (or kulcha, but they're functionally indistinguishable).  It came with plain buttered naan, garlic naan, and onion kulcha.  Served steaming hot, every bit of it was chewy, flavorful, and delicious.  We walked in here not knowing what to expect from a basic, bare-bones decor with just a few servers kept hopping by the busy restaurant.  We walked out full, with leftovers, having paid not much money for the best Indian food we've had yet in the Charlotte area.  University City area is a hike for us, but it's a hike I'll be much happier to make if it means we're coming here.",

For the record, I'd give the restaurant 3.5 stars if possible - the food is very good!  We kindof ordered a feast. Embarassing.   Samosa's, chicken 65, gobi manchurian dry, chicken tikka masala and butter naan.   The samosa's were pretty good but a little dry. They came with the standard red tamarind (sweet!) sauce and green minty sauce. I always prefer the green one, no exception to this rule here. The chicken 65 was goood!   Gobi manchurian was anything but dry. Litterally, it was super wet. The non-dry must just be drenched in sauce or something because the dry was anything but. Still tasty but it gets a little soggy - which is not exactly my preferred texture for cauliflower.  The chicken tikka masala was good albeit a bit sweet. I was also so full at this point that I didn't eat all that much of it. The butter naan was hot and fluffy and cloud like.. it's what bread dreams are made of.",

    "text": "I love this place for their lunch buffet and their lunch specials! I work right across the street at UNCC and they are a great place to go with coworkers or if you just need a warm and cozy meal. The buffet is for dining in at lunchtime and includes a number of traditional dishes including tikka masala (chicken and veggie), tandoori chicken, saag paneer, and of course nan bread and rice. This past visit they also had those gulab jamun (syrup-soaked doughnuts), which taste like syrup soaked pancakes.  They also offer a take-out/delivery lunch special for 2 dishes, nan, and rice. The veggie version is only $4.99 I think and meat is only a dollar more. If you order $20 or more in food, delivery (within a certain radius) is free! Definitely ideal for a small office on campus to get together and order :D",

It did not disappoint. We ordered the Chicken Curry and Chicken Korma with Naan and it was absolutely delicious. The service was good, and it was a good sign to see many Indian and Asian patrons which gave us second opinions as to the authenticity and taste of the food. Would highly recommend to those that are looking for a great Indian restaurant to visit in Charlotte!",

    "text": "Passage to India is essentially 2 awesome restaurants in one: a wide ranging, well-tended buffet at lunch and a great dinner spot with an exhaustive menu. You would be smart to try either, genius to try both.  At lunch, for under $10 you get your run of the buffet table which usually consists of at least two kinds of rice, paneer dish, at least two other veggie dishes, tangine chicken and two other wet entrees, plus salad. The choices are never allowed to go empty and can rotate so it may be worth a second pass if you are still hungry...or if your taste buds insist. The chicken tikka masala is often on the table and has a great flavor.  For dinner Passage to India is my perfect hole-in-the-wall dining experience. There are many choices for each of your main categories, be you chicken, lamb, veggie, or seafood lover. I love the Hydrabadi Keema (Indian hot, of course) which has a deep flavor and practically leaves me licking the serving bowl.  The service is okay. Not overly attentive, but they don't leave you hanging. Like I said, I love the hole-in-the-wall feel but if you are looking for a classy date spot the atmosphere might not be what you want. If that's the case though, bookmark Passage to India and go later. You won't regret it.",

We had garlic naan which was quite good and a red onion chutney that was tasty as well.  I also tasted samosas for the first time and I loved the outside pastry, and the jury is still out on the contents, mainly because of the texture of the mixture, not really the flavor.  Our entree was a vegetarian dish with okra that I didn't write down the name of, but it was actually quite good and seasoned well and not too spicy.  I wasn't overly impressed with our service as my glass was never refilled during our visit, and I'm not sure if I'd dine in again, but might consider takeout to try some of the other offerings because of it's proximity to my house.",

The chicken tikka masala is out of this world.  The service is great, no complaints with the staff - the only issue is that you usually have to wait to be seated. It's a popular place, so there's typically a wait - especially for dinner.  Dinner can get very pricey as they charge per dish, again I recommend going during lunchtime and just doing the buffet instead.  Overall, this place is highly recommended. Give it a shot!",

As an UNCC alumni, I know my way around this area well and there really isn't much on this left-front corner of campus. It really can be hard to spot at first, as it is wedged in the Campus Station shopping center.  This place has a pretty sweet buffet. Although I've gone here once, I highly enjoyed their food options and felt it was an average size buffet. The food was of overall decent quality and the service was very tentative. I'm sure most items ordered off the menu are equally as good as what was available in the buffet.  The location is not a bad walk from campus. The lunch buffet runs until 3p, 3:30p on weekends. The business delivers and takes orders online.",

    "text": "Best. Indian. Lunch. Buffet. In. Charlotte. So far.  First off, f- all your reviews about rude Indian waiters. If you've been to India, you know what may come with the territory... heeheehee... Who doesn't love hole in the walls? I would only moan about the cleanliness depending on whether or not the food was good. And in this case, I don't complain.  There is also nothing that makes me happier then coming here and seeing 80% Indians eating lunch. If this is where all the Indians go, you know it's gotta be good. Dipping fluffy nan bread with their right hands into steaming hot curry.  I haven't tried anything but the lunch buffet, but I think it's incredible value. Everything is done properly, the rotis, idlys, the chana masala, the chicken curries, the raita, etc. There's usually 2 meat curries and 4 veg curries to choose from. Fresh salad (cucumbers to plonk into the raita) and fresh fruit for dessert.  What I'm saying is, know that this isn't gourmet Indian or out-of-the-box Indian. It's just plain average mama's Indian. Which to me, is perfect for a quick lunch. It's also tons better then overpriced Indian, or sad discolored Indian food. Like the Saag Paneer ain't the best you've tasted. But it's satisfying.  Prices:      Lunch Buffet $6.99     Weekend Brunch Buffet $9.99  Me happy. If you want a un-American eating experience, eat here. Crowded to elbows, people eating with their hands, stuffing your face, in, out, job done.

Now, their lunch is a small menu with small portions of curry, large portions of rice, for the same prices as the buffet.    No longer a good deal, but still good flavors.  I like their Saag dishes.",

    "text": "Namaste.  I took a coworker here for lunch. Now you've got to imagine, my coworker and friend, was the living embodiment of Aunt B. from the Andy Griffith show. My mischievous nature thought that it might be interesting to introduce her to something outside of her comfort zone.   Passage to India is a neat way to be introduced to Indian cuisine, since lunchtime features a buffet. One gets to try a little of everything. I have to admit, that I didn't know what I was eating the majority of the time - but it was flavorful, and spicy. I was smart enough to get plenty of the yogurt dish, that I characterize as an \"Indian fire extinguisher.\"  Service was very good. The buffet was kept fresh, and the employees were friendly. Prices were reasonable.   When I asked \"Aunt B.\" if she enjoyed lunch she said, \"yes.\" When I asked her later on if she wanted to return she said, \"uh uh,\" - translation: no. The spiciness was just a little more than she bargained for. ;o)  PS: Parking here is pretty much like trying to squeeze into a sardine can, so arrive early or park down at the left side of the building and walk up. There is more parking on the left, next to Arby's, and less chance of door dings. Also be careful of \"idjits\" driving around the blind narrow corner too fast - it happens.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. Nothing really went wrong, but I just felt like there was nothing to write home about.  For starters, we got here around 8. No one asked us to be seated. We were awkwardly standing by the door between the little space that was around the cash counter. The attendants saw us, but walked by us, and we just stood there till the two parties in front of us who were waiting to pay their bill, were done. Then the guy asked us \"can I help you?\" Yeah, um, we're hungry and would like a table, please. \"Table for two?\"  Then we were seated, but no one came by to take our drinks order or to give us the menu. I finally managed to catch someone's attention and asked for water. Then we got water, but still no menus. Repeat catching someone's attention to bring menus.  We decided on our orders and I told the server we had a free dessert coupon from Yelp. He said that's fine. My boyfriend ordered the cheese masala dosa and I ordered the chicken Chettinad. The Chettinad was delicious (although next time I would ask for mild. If you are not used to the Indian spice levels, maybe you should ask for extra mild). Also, there was a LOT of it! The rice they brought with it was very nice and flavorful, with cumin seeds and green peas. Yumm! The cheese dosa was okay, IMO. It wasn't very thin or crispy and the \"cheese\" inside wasn't cheese, but paneer. For non-Indians, paneer is a type of cheese, but for Indians, paneer is paneer, not cheese. The dosa didn't have cheese, and I didn't enjoy it like I enjoy cheese dosa usually. My paneer-loving boyfriend was very happy though, so that's that. And the potatoes, although plentiful, lacked taste and flavor. The sambhar was just okay.  We did get our free dessert though, one gulab jamun for each of us. Although even that took like 15 minutes to arrive, and I almost thought of passing off on the free dessert and just asking for the check, which then took another 10 minutes to arrive.",

Hopefully they bring the buffet back soon. Or on the lunch menu offer more than the two options. If I could mix and match that would be better.",

The restaurant is located in a strip mall with an awkward parking lot, but once you get into the place, the entire dining room is filled with the aroma of food.  Yes it is a buffet, but they kept it very well stocked and very neat.   The food was good (I ate too much naturally).  Lots of vegetarian options.  Now, I am not an Indian food expert, but I felt pretty satisfied with the price and the food.  Servers were very nice and kept our drinks refilled and the tabled bused even though the lunch crowd was growing and busy.  The place is pretty cramped and doesn't have much atmosphere, but face it, it really makes the food the star.  There is a nice mural of the Taj Mahal on the wall but other than that, nothing too tricky or gimmicky here.",

    "text": "Free extra serving of rice would have made this 5 stars.  I am one of those who is staunchly in the camp of rice is cheap so why charge me for an extra serving (especially when you have the smallest servings or rice in town).  The food was good, we really enjoyed the flavor.  The table had the lamb korma, the chicken malabar, butter chicken, and the lamb kebabs (different name).  The food came out attractive and properly spiced.  They didn't get two parts of our order right: we had ordered raita, and they brought out the wrong dessert.  Water service was right on the spot.  Although even before things got busy they seemed to not be in the groove - slow.  Skip the garlic naan - way too strong.  The mango lassi is as good as any I have had in Charlotte, still not the level of what was available in Mumbai.  I would go here again but I will probably not ask for extra rice and I may come for the buffet.  UPDATE: I came back for the buffet.  I thought the biryani was better than at Persis, and the buffet had a better variety of things to eat.  I enjoy that they had goat, but unfortunately a variety of meats (lamb, possibly beef although it is not traditional), would have been appreciated.  On the menu were two chicken dishes - a tomato based sweet dish and one with bones.  Some toroidal (donut shaped) fried food.  They had a vegetable and cheese version of meatballs in what resembled korma sauce.  I strongly recommend the buffet over getting an entree because of the variety, although the entree I ordered tasted better than what was on the buffet.",

Everyone else's reviews raved about the buffet, but I was here for dinner on a Tuesday. I will definitely try to make it out to the buffet if I'm in University at lunch time.  I had been here years ago when the place was Udipi, it doesn't seem like much has changed.   We split the CHILLI PANEER appetizer. It was good. I definitely liked it more than my boyfriend but I'm a sucker for any Indian food with lots of paneer. The texture of the panner in this app is a lot like tofu with almost a sweet and sour type sauce over top. Served on a bed of mixed greens, rather like a salad.  I tried the MUTTER PANEER as my entree. I told the server I wanted it at a medium level of spicey, but it was pretty mild. Maybe I looked like a sissy and he didn't think I could handle it? :] I was still happy with my selection.  My boyfriend ordered the MUSHROOM PALAK, which was okay, Nothing special, nothing bad.  We shared POORI BREAD and GARLIC NAAN. Not the best we'd ever had, but still yummy.",

    "text": "For this edition of Excited about Eating we visited Passage to India, located in the Campus Station Shopping Center in the University area of Charlotte. Now, I have to admit, I normally don't eat at Indian restaurants because I have heard the food is very spicy. But today we were up for trying something different.  We were in luck. Instead of choosing just one dish, we were able to experience multiple items from their lunch buffet, and many of them were very good. My favorite was the Chilli Fish, fresh tilapia marinated with spices, fried and tossed with bell pepper and onions. The fish was lightly battered and perfectly cooked. Dora here. Tilapia typically isn't a fish I'd choose, but I really liked this dish. Not too fishy and great flavor.  Another favorite was the Tandoori Chicken, marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic & fresh spices and grilled in a clay oven. This dish was outstanding with the ginger and garlic shining through and the chicken carried a smokey favor. The Goat Curry, baby goat cooked in onion, tomato, and ginger gravy was great over the Basmati rice.   My wife's favorite was the Chicken Tikka Masala, boneless chicken breast marinated in ginger, garlic, yogurt & spices and grilled in a charcoal clay oven. Dora here. The Chicken Tikka Masala was moist and tender, and sported just the right amount of heat. Unlike the Chicken Biryani which lit my mouth on fire! One taste of the Biryani and I was begging to switch my iced tea to diet coke. lol. And I really liked the Gulab Jamun, sugar-soaked balls shaped like doughnut holes, and that's what they tasted like: dense, sweet doughnuts. Ernie wasn't a fan.   For dessert, we had the Mango Custard, made with fresh fruits. Not too sweet but just the right amount of fruit in a creamy milk sauce. Dora here. The mango custard was light and refreshing, not too heavy after eating from a buffet. And that's another thing. Normally, buffets leave me stuffed and bloated, but neither of us felt that way when we finished eating.  Overall, this experience was enjoyable and I would eat Indian food again. I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant that serves great food. Ernie & Dora Hiers Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "Used to love this place. Not anymore.  The day we moved to Charlotte, we found this restaurant and have been going for 3 years. Rarely do we change what we order and NEVER do we change HOW it's ordered. It's a simple order. And STILL they can't get it right. Keep in mind we used to order sometimes twice a week from this place.  It's ALWAYS a hit/miss with them.   When you complain the guy in charge is hiding in the kitchen. When you get the take out incorrectly and find out once you open it at home and call- he's away and will call back. Never get a call back.  So we started going for the predictable buffet. There is NO selection for vegans/vegetarians. The dishes are now all their appetizers. The rest is all meat.   Strange as i thought indian food boasted a large non meat option. But not here. The prices keep edging up and the service is BELOW average.   Is it so difficult for you to clear a table before bringing in the main course?  Is it so difficult for you to cook the dish when it has been sent back to the kitchen twice already?  Simple things but they don't get done. Your staff zig zags all over the place to bring one thing or another but can NOT figure out take things off the table AT THE SAME TIME TOO.    Between the quality of the food and terrible service we are done with this place. And I won't even go into how my husband was sick the last time we ate there.   You used to be good. Shame you let the standard drop so much. Not that it was much to begin with.",

The butter chicken was pretty good and after two plates I was full. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and how they catered to giving you the sense of an Indian culture.

Their Indo chinese dishes are also yum. The also have a good variety of south Indian dishes too. Something on the buffet for everyone. It may become mine and hubby's weekend hangout.

The walls are riddled with muck and the cheap quality furniture is very uncomfortable, the staff is unfriendly even though there were no other customers there when we arrived! (Note to self: when you enter a restaurant and there's no one else dining there, turn around and exit!)  Now to the menu - be forewarned - there's NO alcoholic beverages or even sodas! Are you serious?  Yep.  The chicken vindaloo my wife ordered only had three pieces of chicken and three gigantic pieces of potato - that's it, for $11.00 - what a rip off.  My paneer curry was too sweet even after I asked them to make it spicy.  I'm indian and I like spicy food.  They couldn't even do that right.  We bought my grandson along too so he can celebrate grandma's birthday.  Poor kid took one bite of the dosa and didn't touch it after - he said it was too hard.  Sad to say, we all left the restaurant hungry and disappointed.  The staff didn't even have the integrity to apologize after we complained - what a dump.   They think just because they're located near UNCC that they will always be profitable, but being cheapskates with food quality/quantity will not let them stay in business for long.",

My house is in the city, in a neighborhood with a street light right in front of my house, not difficult to find.  When he arrived he shoved my food at me and stomped off without a word.  The second time I ordered on a Friday night, their website says they're open until 11:00 and delivery orders are accepted until 10:30.  I work at a restaurant and I got home late, so I placed my order shortly after 10:00, plenty of time before their 10:30 cutoff and 11:00 closing time.  The driver arrived around 10:50 and told me, VERY rudely, that if ever want them to deliver again I need to call earlier because they need to have time to clean up.  They still weren't even closed yet!  Why is calling almost an hour before they close still not early enough???   If my restaurant turned people away an hour before we closed because we need to clean, I can't imagine we'd be open for business too much longer.  If you don't want to be open until 11:00 then change your hours of operation, don't have your website tell your customers one thing and you say another.",

    "text": "So good!  Don't let the easy-to-miss exterior fool you...the lunch buffet can't be beat.  For a low price you can eat your fill of fresh masalas and naan and chickpea wonders.  Always spend the next few days thinking that their lunch would be better than whatever I am eating.  Other people know about the food so try not to go at a peak lunch time because you'll compete for seats with a long line (but it is worth the wait).  I'd recommend this place to introduce anyone to Indian food!",
