At first we were kinda wondering about the place because of a slightly funky smell in the air, but decided to stay.  Our waitress seemed really hurried and didn't stop for more than 10 seconds to talk to us, often speaking AS she walked past our table, half the time we didn't hear what she said. We ended up ordering our meal from a different waiter.     We ordered Monterey Chicken, which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The Chicken and mashed potatoes were all yummy and perfect, but the broccoli wasn't nearly as good. They looked old, browning and we ended up not eating any of it once we noticed it.",

I knew I'd be staying at a Tyvola hotel, and the yelp app showed me that I was close to a Chili's.  They took my order- moments before closing- and thanks to the staff here, I got to have dinner.   The food was exactly what you'd expect- which was good- but they get some extra stars for being so accommodating. Thanks again, if it weren't for you, I'd have had Slim Jims and Lay's for dinner.",

First time for me and will definitely order it again. As I was eating, the server placed the check on the end of the table, as if that was a clue.

I appreciate that we took up the table for more than an hour during a busy lunch, but I used to be service industry, and would have tipped accordingly if our server hadn't been so obviously pushing as hard as she could to get us out of the table.

I intended to stuff myself at the chinese buffet right up the road, but they decided to fancy it up with crablegs for new year and I simply didn't feel like spending that much money for lunch.  I was hungry, my 1 hour is clicking away, and I pulled into Chili's.  I went for their lunch combo, and for some reason I just wasn't feeling sandwiches.  Instead I got the $8 combo with cajun chicken pasta with a side of soup (chicken enchilada).  The soup was good... I'm a big soup person.  It's similar to a tortilla soup.  The plating was pretty, pasta on one side of the long white plate, a thick slice of garlic toast and the soup on the other end (the one day I forgot my cellphone/camera).  The pasta on the other hand was oh-so-salty.  This is coming from a sodium addict.  Chicken slices were dry.  Pasta chewy.  But I somehow wasn't disappointed, because this is somewhat expected.  Service was great, my waitress was prompt & responsive & polite.  The atmosphere was nice & quiet; I got to read my book.  It was surprisingly relaxing of a lunch.",

It was just before 4 pm and the waitress came back and said that it was Happy Hour and the appetizers were $4.99.  We ordered 2 - one flat bread pizza and some kind of nachos.  I was surprise of the size of the plates.  We were totally satisfied.   The service and 2 of the staff we dealt with were so nice.  Can pay electronically from the table which we really liked.

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in at 9 p.m. tonight. The store appeared to be about half full. The hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait. I asked why. Well, she said, gesturing to one half of the restaurant, this side is closed... (quite a few tables were occupied, and I could see staff cleaning two of the tables).... and on the other half, she said they had three servers working (I am quoting the hostess), but the open tables in that half of the store 'were dirty' so she could not sit us there.  Disregarding the fact that staff was already cleaning the closed area but not the open area, I dared to ask: what about the bar area? There was an open table with four chairs in the center of the bar area. No, she said. That table was \"reserved\" for \"larger\" parties of people. Really? Really. So, I said, there are chairs open in the bar area along one 1/2 wall and other patrons had obviously been sitting there recently because two empty beer bottlers were on the table. She said no, we couldn't sit there either because no servers worked that area and the bartender would be the only one serving.  I was so pissed. There were no other customers waiting - just us. So it wasn't like there were actually larger parties of four to sit in at the \"reserved table\" in the bar area either. This place is mediocre on their good days anyway, and with cops regularly patrolling both the restaurant and parking lot regularly, it has never given me any sense of ease. After this, I can guarantee they won't be getting any more of my business. Ever.(We left without waiting and the hostess clearly didn't care.)",

A little over a year ago, I vowed to never return, but they seem to have gotten their shit together and we actually went enough over the past few weeks that the wait staff in the bar area of seating recognizes us when we come in (we're awfully cute and personable, plus good tippers - so I understand why we are memorable).  They have a revamped menu and while a lot of the old standards are there, they have some new items too.  I *really* like the option to turn any burger into a turkey burger (or veggie, or 2 thin beef patties) and had that twice last week.  The potato soup was very good and my BFF was living on their chicken enchilada soup while she was sick and she said that was very good too.   I have to absolutely commend the daytime bar-area wait staff.  I think the one gentleman's name is Adam, who has been there forever and has always been a shining star, and there is also a woman working in that area (can't remember her name - ugh) and they are rock stars.  Drinks never go empty, plates are cleared, sweeteners are brought, etc.  Seriously - they are amazing and should be given gold stars or raises or whatever it is that Chili does.  The food has improved drastically, but the wait staff that can get us fed and back to work in time is what is keeping us coming there.    Great job by this Chili's to turn it around.  It's verging on a 4-star review for me, keep it up!",

    "text": "Despite some rough reviews here, for 2 nights in a row...nothing but a great experience from top to bottom. Close, walking distance from Crowne Plaza. Immediate seating. Prompt attention. Ben, the waiter, took 8 orders - never wrote anything down - and each was exactly right; even the little details like 'no lemon', or something 'on the side'. Quite remarkable, really!  Buffalo Chicken Ranch was really tasty. Ben even remembered the next night what I had the previous night. Second night, sIrloin steak, (cooked to order), w/his recommendation of loaded mashed potatoes, was a great combo.  Plenty of food, good prices, excellent service, clean. Go for it!!!",

    "text": "Sunday night, near hotel, not wanting to hunt down anything new figured we'd stick with tried & True tonight after a day of driving. Mistake unfortunately.  Husband got burger & fries, I got soup & salad. No major complaints with the food, or the wait staff, though hubby's fries & my soup was cool. Left too long on the counter? The incredible NOISE that drove us out after a single drink & dinner.   When did Chili's become a sports bar? the volume going on TV was so loud that when our server came to the table, we couldn't hear him. Couldn't hear each other talking to each other. It was mind boggling. Everyone in the restaurant of course increased their volume to hear over each other, eh, noise goes up.  After asking the server about it, they turned it down some, claiming that the guys at the bar wanted it turned up. Really? when do a few knuckleheads at the bar 4 feet from the tv dictate what an entire restaurant is forced to listen to? or that single station? The music playing the restaurant couldn't be heard at ALL it was so loud.  We love Chili's & have visited them in several states. This one gets a big thumbs down.",

In spite of the fact that half of the restaurant was empty and full of dirty tables, the greeter told us there was nowhere to sit ... At 10pm. She was very rude. This restaurant was filthy with garbage on the floor and dirty restrooms. As I walked by the kitchen area, it was more of the same. Just disgusting.   On the positive side, our server was great and focused in spite of the fact that he had been working since 9:30am. It is clear this store is running way too lean on people. The food was reasonable. I just wonder about the conditions it was prepared in. We won't likely be back.",

    "text": "Sunday late evening eat out options are slim. However a yelp search told us that Chili's at Tyvola was open for another hour. We were seated quickly. After about ten minutes, our server came to take our drink orders. My husband ordered a strawberry lemonade, my son - water, and I a mixed berry margarita.  When our drinks arrived, my husband's strawberry lemonade magically transformed into iced tea. Not a big deal, it was swapped out. We placed our order. My husband and son would share a 2 for $20, with Texas fries as a start, sirloin steak for my son, chicken quesadilla for the hubby. I will have a bottomless soup and salad with vinaigrette dressing.  The Texas fries arrived to the table burnt. We would have returned it but could not find our server or any other staff. While my husband and son worked through the fries, I continued to search for our server to find out what happened to my tostada chips that come with the bottomless soup and salad. When I finally found her, she told me that I did not order the bottomless option, but okay, she'll amend the order. My chips arrived within five minutes, stale and chewy. A few minutes later, our meals arrived with ranch dressing for the salad as opposed to the vinaigrette I ordered.  My soup and salad were okay otherwise. My son loved his steak. The quesadilla my husband ordered was put down after two bites, it was barely edible.  After this experience, I wanted to only give one star. The only reason for the second star is due to my son's meal. Needless to say, I will not return.",

    "text": "In town to visit relatives. A short visit. Staying at the hotel park and decided to grab dinner before it was too late for my toddler son. He wasn't feeling well so instead of driving we took a walk on the nice evening to Chili's. Our hotel said it was right up the street and it was a short walk away. Arrived and promptly seated. The restaurant is a little less than half full around 6:45 pm on a Thursday evening.   I haven't been to a Chili's in years so I had no idea to to expect but I know I probably won't be eating dinner inside with this toddler as it is close to his bedtime. The hostess is too kind and offers a high chair twice along with some crayons wrapped in a coloring book. She tells me about Chili's Rewards. My waiter is fast, a nice gentleman Sean, who greets my son first then me. I love when people acknowledge your kids. He asks me about beverages and if I want something for my son. He comes back with drinks and asks me about my menu options. At this time my son has taking a liken to to the paper wrapped silverware. And he is beating them on the table like drums. He loves all things musical and even plays the tambourine all day while at church. It isn't too loud and the venue as I said isn't crowded.   As Sean is taking my menu items, another waiter, a black gentleman and I am black as well, comes up to the table with no salutations or greetings to either my son or I and just takes the silverware from my 23 month old sons hands and places them away from him on the center of the table. I proceed to order my food then ask for the manager. Because I was completely thrown off by what just happened in front of my face.   1. You did not greet me. 2. You did not greet my son. 3. You took something out of my sons hand. 4. You did not ask me if you could approach my son or take something out of his hand.  5. You did not say a word to me. No comment that my son was disturbing other guests.  6. In order to place the utensils on the table in front of you had to reach over me as I was ordering my food.  7. You walked away as if nothing happened.  8. You offered no apology after I spoke to 2 managers requesting that you apologize.  9. You proceeded to avoid any contact with me. Not a real man. Definitely not the man who boldly walked over to take something out of my sons hands.   The manager comped my meal. And apologized on behalf of the server, Marcus, who was both rude and disrespectful. The whole ordeal could have been avoided if Marcus would have said something to me, the parent, instead of reprimanding my child as if it was his own by avoiding conversation with me and taking the liberty to remove something out of his hand again without my consent.   He essentially touched my child and I doubt if someone could touch your child unless it was life threatening with you present without you having something to say. I waited as my food was prepared and Marcus so boldly avoided me and any opportunity to offer an apology. I found it interesting that the security guard made his way over to my area to stand and wait as well. He stared into my face multiple times and watched me like a hawk. Could a 5'5 woman with a toddler so scare an establishment that security has to be called over because they are afraid I'm going to approach Marcus and what, demand the apology that I so rightly deserved? When I asked the guard if there was a problem because I hadn't seen him the entire time of my visit until my request for an apology. He stated he worked here and that is no issue. No, it was a case of discrimination, disrespect and negligence that they didn't want to hold Marcus accountable for. The managers did apologize but I told them it should come from Marcus. They said they could ask him but they couldn't make it as they would deal with him individually. The truth is they probably never said a word.  The combo fajita and chicken tender platter was actually good. While I wouldn't patron such a disgusting establishment that allows certain servers to do whatever they want to do to customers and their children for that matter without demanding that a real man or woman apologize for their short coming or mistakes, you are free to do so. I guess this behavior is tolerated in the South. Not, coming from where I'm from. You don't ever disrespect a parent or a child, period. You are not his dad or parent, who was down the street.  And a security guard doesn't scare me. I did nothing wrong. There goes a place perpetuating stereotypes. I won't be bullied.  I hope you find this review helpful in determining the most welcoming establishments to eat as a family while in Charlotte. And lord help you if you take a tired toddler who makes too much noise. The servers will take it into their own hands to remove anything that disturbs others without talking to you. That's the last time I visit a Chilis. And I have already written Corporate.",

Y'all, they don't wash the bagged salad (probably no chain does due to cross contamination issues) but this is the first, and hopefully last, time I see this in my food. I doubt I ever order another salad from any restaurant. I'll make my own at home. The manager was nice, I didn't make a scene, didn't cause a fuss and left the server a tip. She didn't charge me for my meal. This was actually my 12-year-old granddaughter's salad. She's a vegan. And it traumatized her for a while until I took her to the restroom and made her laugh. She got sick. I felt horrible. The manager offered her dessert (ice cream, for a Vegan) but she was upset too. It's a good thing I'm not a litigious person. My granddaughter is still sick and it's Tuesday. She got some of it in her mouth and swallowed it. She spat out what you see. She was so embarrassed as you can imagine a pre-teen would be. It's probably in her head but she missed school yesterday and half of today. And this kid is never out of school. Just thought you all would want to know.",

If you sign up for their new rewards program, every time you visit a chilis you can have a free chips and salsa or a non alcoholic beverage. I think that's a great deal.  Of course we had the bottomless chips and salsa.  Their chips are always super salty but the salsa is delicious. Sometimes I just want to come for the chips and salsa and the chicken enchilada soup.  They have a $10 special going on right now that I also took advantage of.  It includes a choice of a non alcoholic beverage, soup or salad, and a choice of entree. (From a list of 6). I had the honey chipotle chicken crispers and it came with fries and corn on the cob. All this for $10 is a great deal. It was plenty of food and I had left overs for lunch the next day. I really like their chicken enchilada soup. I wish I could make it at home.   Customer service was great as well.  Chili's is one of my preferred chain restaurants and I will be returning to this one as long as the service stays this stellar! In case you can't see it from Tyvola Road, it's right behind the exotic car dealership and next to Costco. Happy dining!",

I watched many tables go with acknowledgement for upwards of 15 minutes. I happen to work in the service industry for their sister company and I know for a fact that's not their way of doing things. The bartender did turn my experience around but this is only after my friend approached the bar after being sat in a section and not being acknowledged. The bartender did receive a well deserved tip so I do appreciate that. I'm just not understanding how the servers make any money here with their nonchalant lack luster attitudes",

We walked into a restaurant full of empty tables & were told we had to wait 5 min to clean. 10 min later he comes back to tell us another 5-10 because there's only 1 server & nothing is clean. We are looking at atleast 4 people including the manager waiting on tables and plenty of clean areas to sit. Today they lost our business and others walked out as well.",

Also enjoyed the appetizer plate with pick 3. Sliders were juicy and flavorful, boneless wings, too much breading.  Still noisy atmosphere, but we were in private room with poor acoustics.",

    "text": "It's Chili's. Pretty much been to one, been to them all. My group agreed to come here simply because it was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel. However this one had some sort of discord. There was a 10-15 minute wait, ok cool. Even though we can clearly see there is 4 tables available. Already been busted. Whatever. Maybe there is a queue? No. We're just sitting here because you can make us? Ok.  So, while we waited, we browsed through the menu and knew exactly what we were ordering. Then the hostess went outside and spoke to someone. There was a couple that was outside giving directions to someone to get here. That was the hold up?! So, we couldn't just sit at one of the OTHER tables? Whatever. We were about to leave when they decided to seat us. Our waiter came by and greeted us, then told us to give him a minute and he disappeared into the kitchen. He reemerged with a plate and served a table, then came back. He asked if we were ready and we placed our orders. I asked for boned in hot wings, and was told there were no wings of any kind. I was upset because that's what I had my heart set on. He told me to hold on and went into the kitchen. He quickly came out and told me there was boneless available. Ok, that's cool. He got the rest of the orders and we had to stop him before he left because he didn't get our drink orders. We waited for about 20 minutes before he stopped back at the table to drop off chips and salsa. And came back 20 minutes later to serve our food. We waited for a total of 40 minutes for some hot wings, a burger with fries, two salads, and a soup. My wings were pretty good, but not 40 minutes good. We ate and then our waiter came back to ask about splitting the check. Before we could say anything, he suggested 2 checks. No. We all said we wanted it separate. He still said 2 checks. No. 4. 2? 4!!!!! Then he finally got it. We debated on leaving a tip, but decided not to be one of those people. Won't be back.",

    "text": "First time to Chili's and I will be back for their afternoon lunches. Great to relax and take a break from an all morning conference with a margarita for $5 dollars and one of their sandwiches. The menu is pretty extensive when it comes to lunch.  Staff is friendly and quick when it comes to bringing your drinks and meals. They probably get patrons from all the surrounding hotels for lunch and dinner too.  The food is good, reasonable prices and the drinks are awesome.  Really like their gadget-tablet at every table where you just swipe your credit card, sign and go. No need to get the check from the waitstaff. Eat and run out with the check all processed. Now, how cool is that. Have not tried the games on the tablet yet.",

The girl was very rude and told me then hung up the phone before I could say anything else or ask any questions. Major attitude. I'm southern and say yes mam and thank you but I got nothing but a bad taste in my mouth after speaking to the girl that answered.",
