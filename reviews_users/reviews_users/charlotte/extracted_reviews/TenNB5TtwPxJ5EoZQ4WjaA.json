I use to visit the Yafo location in South Park like once a week. Chicken shawarma wrap. They do the wrap PERFECTLY. And BIG! Save your money at central, get a bowl, because the wrap is not worth your cash. And calling in an order, you can forget that being right. I love Yafo but I hate going to the central location.",

My overall suggestion is bring staff from Southpark or just go to that location.",

It's similar to that of chipotle or subway etc and the music is kind of loud and they are behind a tall glass and I'm pretty short so I had to be the person who asked \"what\" 7 times. They didn't really want to explain what anything was and I wanted to ask for recommendations and specifics but they just seemed to want to get me through the line. Not to mention the tzatziki portion they give you is really small so I ended up asking for three. A very nice bus boy kept checking on us and was so sweet and accommodating. I probably wouldn't have given it 4 stars if his customer service had sucked. That's pretty much it. Want to come back at a less busy time, will definitely be back for food. Also there is parking.",

My first visit I had no clue what I was doing, and no one helped me understand. I ended up with a salad. It was ok, mostly because I don't want to eat a salad at a restaurant. As I walked further, I saw all the sides (mezzes, but how am I supposed to know that on my first time?) and I was disappointed in my choice. The next time, I knew better, and wow, the chicken was delicious and the Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and potatoes were amazing. The falafel are some of the best I've ever had.  The service could be better, as in help a girl out to get the good stuff! Also, when ordering online, don't bother putting a time in. They disregard it. I would also check your food when you pick it up. I did not get the white meat I paid a dollar extra for.  Like I said, the food is excellent! Just some things to be aware of as far as making sure the get what you want!",

I am left full without feeling sluggish. I especially enjoy the mango tea mixed with love potion. This is also the only place I will eat Brussel sprouts. I don't know what they do to them here, but they are outstanding. The macaroni and cheeses was impressive; I didn't expect it to be creamy or al dente. It was both.

However, I've given the Plaza Midwood location 3x and will not be returning.  If you want a \"bowl\" at the PM location, you'll be fine.  Seems like this is the most popular choice here. If you want a full \"family meal\", you'll probably have issues -again, only seems to be a problem in PM. The first time we ordered a family meal, we got home to discover chicken slices and pieces in the to-go box, second time, the server and management was confused with what exactly a \"family meal\" was and the sides with it, the third(and last time) they understood what the meal consisted of(YAY!) but didn't have a full chicken without a 30 minute wait.  This was revealed AT THE REGISTER.   If you want a simple bowl...go.  If you want a consistent product with a family style chicken option, go to SouthPark or Dilworth or, better yet, go to Viva Chicken in Elizabeth. You won't be disappointed.

    "text": "LOVE Yafo! We are there at least once a week, think of this amazing spot as Chipotle ON CRACK! ;) It's clean, delicious and fairly quick to get through the cafeteria style line. Even when it's crazy crowded the line doesn't take more than 10 min which is MUCH LESS time than you'd wait at a sit down restaurant! The regular choices vs premium/upcharged choices aren't a huge difference for me personally but just know that each is a $1 upcharge (it adds up quickly )! The staff is usually friendly, they are human though so don't pitch a fit if one person doesn't want to have a full blown conversation with you about your day... they see hundreds of people - ain't nobody got time for all that! LOVE the teas and other drinks, try them all - you'll thank me!",

I like the \"build your own\" options that allows you to combine just about all the ingredients the way you want.  We got the Falafel and Greek wraps.  Both were good.  The mezze options are also tasty.  The tabouleh is particularly good.  Ordered a salad bowl with eggplant.  It was OK.  My only complain is that too many items are mixed together in a relatively small bowl so that the tastes get all mixed up.  Variety of condiments and home made drinks are also great.",

The line is slow, the staff are disorganized and don't handle the crowd near as efficiently as the other location. For one the takeout bowls changed and you get far less food than the original takeout bowls, also, it didn't indicate anywhere on the menu that the beef took 5 minutes to cook and were told this after I had already paid for our bowls. After the line, we of course didn't want to wait so missed out on it. I know it just opened, but overall this location needs some major work to live up to the south park location. I hope that the owners aren't stretching themselves too thin with location openings to make sure that quality service, food, and customer experience is being delivered. First unsatisfactory yafo experience, just go to the south park location. UPDATE: we got home and our chicken is COLD, not even room temp, ice cold. Honestly don't know if I'll be frequenting yafo at all after this experience",

Like many fast casual dining establishments--there are so many options when you begin to consider all the ways you can mix and match--the set dishes can be a great first experience approach, but once you get the hang of it, the freedom to choose is liberating. My go to is always half kale and spinach and half grain bowl. With toppings a mile long, there is something for everyone to enjoy--even for those with a vegetarian and vegan diet.  The parking lot is a whole different story--hold your breath as you squeeze into the compact car spots and double check the backup camera as you put it in reverse as you say \"see you soon\" and cruise out of the lot.",

First off, the thing that sets Yafo apart from so many other fast casual places is that they use all fresh ingredients and make everything from scratch every single day! I highly recommend getting half hummus, half couscous, sampling the various salads, adding tazazki sauce, feta, stuffed grape leaves, and adding some sauces on the side. Don't forget the airy and delectable laffah bread as well! You will not be disappointed in this establishment. Perhaps Mediterranean food is not your thing. Just try it!

Then when they bring us our bag to the table, we notice no hummus on our wrap and my daughter goes up to ask why. she said oh yes, I see a smear here. Hello. For 11.00 for a wrap you should have more that 1/3 a teaspoon and 5 little chick peas. Like I said I would just think you place was cheap except for the other 6 people who where dining in and the amounts on the plates and in their wraps. Something is wrong. We actually stopped here because of the good reviews and were just a bit disappointed. I hope it was not unconscious bias on how we were served...hummmm",

Oh, the sweet tea with mango was phenomenal.  I can't wait to go back just for the tea.  The servers were patient with us as we figured out the menu, which I appreciate way more than they realize.  I can tell they have been trained well!!  I will certainly go back!  This visit was on accident because we didn't want to wait 45 mins at Midwood Smokehouse next door.  It was a very happy surprise visit and we will certainly be back.",

    "text": "Excited Yafo is in Plaza Midwood, same great food and service. I would say this location does not have a lot of indoor seating, but plenty of seating indoors. Be aware that Plaza Midwood can be a hard place to park. This location has take out/order ahead should you want to take yours to go.  If you didn't know Yafo is an amazing Mediterranean/Middle Easter restaurant, where you get in line, and order what you want on the other side of glass. They work very quickly so don't be intimidated by long lines.   I tell people this is a great place to go if they want to try something new, or if they have people with them with allergies. Yafo's menu has a lot to choose from for people with special dietary needs.  Everything I've tried is really good, especially the bread. I love that you can customize things to what you want and everything isn't fried .   Glad this franchise is branching out in Charlotte, NC.",

    "text": "Yahoo for Yafo! Consider me a BIG fan especially since I refused to believe the hype, if you will. I was wrong to pass judgement.  A recent Tuesday evening, I had a meeting in the area and decided this was an opportune time to finally try Yafo. Yafo is located directly across the street from Midwood Smokehouse and is brightly colored with a gray and green exterior. There's a designated parking lot but I can imagine that it gets very tight during peak times. Thankfully, I visited around 5:30 and it was not busy at all. I was able to walk right up to the counter without a line and order!  Since I was a newbie, I figured I would go with one of the signature menu items - the Chicken Shawarma wrap. I struggled with choosing a side because they all looked so delicious but, ultimately, decided on the roasted cauliflower with lemon tahini sauce. I also ordered a beverage with my meal and my total came to $14 plus change. Not bad at all considering I had leftovers for my lunch the next day.  For my beverage, I decided to mix their cool mint lime and lemonade which produced a refreshing, slightly sweet/tart beverage. BIG FAN. I sat down and dug in. The chicken was so juicy and the seasoning was on point. The pita wrap was warm and doughy. I could do some damage if I had a stack of those wraps. The cauliflower was roasted just right and the lemon tahini sauce just took it to the next level. If you order the cauliflower, you must get the sauce. Trust me.  I look forward to going back multiple times and creating my own bowls/salads!",

This happens in the restaurant and for mobile orders regularly.   Tonight I mobile ordered and it says my order will be ready in 20 minutes. I head to Yafo and on the way, I receive a text saying my order is ready so I head in. I then get inside and they tell me they are \"just waiting on falafel\". I wait over 10 minutes for the falafel. When I get my food it's been over 30 minutes since I ordered, but the food was stated to be \"ready in 20 minutes\". Why have mobile ordering if I still have to wait?

I love getting the bowl with two different bases, all of which are delicious but I think their hummus has an excellent creaminess to it, as well as the baba ganoush, but you can also get grains or lettuce. Then the best part, choosing from all the fresh toppings. There's too many to list here! I usually get the chicken on top of mine, but they have a variety of other meats and veggie options. And to top it off the bowl comes with a homemade, nice and warm pita like bread! So good.  The bowl is usually enough for two meals for me!  You can also order the rotisserie chicken with sides. The Mac n cheese is good and made with Greek yogurt, but the Brussels are my fav!   They also serve beers, ciders and wine (and even have some on tap!). And this location is pretty big on the inside, so finding a table is no problem!",

In the winter (southern) season of heavy casseroles, it's  great having a fast-casual spot nearby that is both delicious and healthy! I'd suggest opting to build your own bowl and add as many fresh ingredients as possible. I usually get salad/cous cous combo with a hummus spread and then add ALL the veggies. This is one place where a meat is not needed to make the dish flavorful or filling. Try their chickpea salad or roasted beets! I'm a big fan of their spicy red schug, too. If you like it hot, his sauce is a must!  Also, if you're close by, try to walk there...parking can get tricky during busy hours (same could be said for most every business in PM).",

This time around I went with a group of friends and was given a couple of recommendations.   Most of their options can be made as bowl, salad or wrap. The pita bread is made on site and you can see it being made as you are in line.  I went with the Marrakesh Lamb wrap. All I have to say is wow! All the flavors in this wrap had a party and danced in my mouth. Adding the spicy sauces (Schug) made it even more amazing. I had to use their garlic sauce to cool down my mouth.  Besides the line options, they also have a large fountain drink selection and a bar for 3 additional sauces.   I honestly can't wait to come back and try something else on their menu. The only thing stopping me is this place gets busy. I've seen lines out the door. So probably best to come on off hours.",

The set up was easy to navigate as it showed me which veggies and sides I could add in my bowl. The juices are also great as my favorite was the cardamon vanilla cider. Yafo is very similar to CAVA but they have a different taste and a little larger veggie section.",

If it is your first time here I recommend getting the menu walking through the line to visually see the options available, then going through a second time. It was an amazing,healthy, and extremely tasteful meal. Let's talk drinks. Next to the fountain machine where soft drinks are served,  there are paper cones, take one and try all the specialty beverages such as love potion. My favorite  the lime coconut mint!!

If you haven't been it is like any other of the casual dinning meets fast food place like Moes, and Zoes etc but for whatever reason their set up seems more confusing to me. Maybe it is because they do have some set dishes and then some build your own.  The location in Plaza is a nice addition to the area and I love that they having a little bit of parking.  If you park in one of the front spots make sure to pull all the way up in the spots so others cars can get through.  The best part of Yafo is their menu is great for anyone who has dietary issues from vegetarians and gluten free,  to vegans and low carb folks.   My favorite items  are the their Brussel sprouts, MAC and Cheese, Beets and their Falafel.",

There is a lot of seating available - sadly no tables outside, though there are chairs.

Yafo is a \"fast-casual\" Greek/Mediterranean inspired restaurant.  Much like Subway or Chipotle, you go down the line to customize your entree and proceed to the register.  After checkout you fill your beverage cup and either head on your way or seat yourself at an available table.  There is no table service, though they will offer to clear your table of trash or top off your drink.  Once you are done, leave any dishes on your table and their dining room attendant will clear them for you.  Shawarma and hummus are my goto options here.  The hummus bowl is out of this world!  They also offer salads, lamb, etc.  The mac and cheese has a different twist, made with large shells and topped with a dollop of sour cream.  There are several unique drink options as well.  Try the coconut!  All entrees are served with a side of fresh pita bread.  Parking seems limited at first glance, but there are two hour spaces behind the building and the first floor of the parking garage at the adjacent apartment community is reserved for retail patrons.",

    "text": "We were obsessed with Yafo's falafel, but the last few times we have gone it hasn't been good. We go only for the falafel (and incredible sauces!) and were totally hooked on it since the first South Park location opened.   We used to drive across town for it because it was just that good. What made it so special and worth driving for was that the falafel were small, extra crispy, and flavorful.   So when the new location in PM opened we were there every week. Then a few weeks or so ago the falafel suddenly changed - totally different than it's been since they first opened.   The patties are much bigger, and the texture is very mushy and off-putting now. We usually both get the wrap, but with the big falafel there is just not enough crispiness to prevent the wrap from becoming a big lukewarm, gushy mess. Like eating a pasty burrito.   The falafel also don't taste as flavorful, but that could just be because you get less tasty fried surface area. We've given it a few shots but it's just not as good. The rest of the menu is probably good but I can only speak of the falafel. Used to be the best, now below average.  If they ever go back to their original falafel (pleeeease!) I will happily update this review. In the meantime, I can't recommend Yafo anymore.",

    "text": "I might be jumping the gun by slapping a five-star rating on this \"fast casual\" Med restaurant after a single visit.  But this was the best bang for the buck I'd ever experienced in a fast-casual restaurant, and one of the best I'd experienced in any restaurant in years, period.    Ten dollars gets your FOUR mezze, i.e., appetizers.  The restaurant did not skimp on portions, and the quality was as high or higher than in plenty of table-service Mediterranean places.  (The wife and I are Anglo-Celtic natives of the American South who sure didn't grow up with such fare and don't pretend to be experts, but at the same time we are long-time Med/Middle Eastern/Lebanese food freaks and have been to our share of such restaurants.)  Had tabbouleh, baba ghanouj, a chickpea salad, and falafel.  Everything was fresh and terrific and flavorful.  My only complaints are nit-picky:  Tabbouleh had a higher bulgur ratio than I'd prefer (gimme that parsley), and a little salty, and the baba ghanouj was also a bit salty.    An mezze outlay of this quality and quantity would probably set you back 20 or 25 dollars at a table-service restaurant.     The world needs more YAFOs.",

Brought the whole family this time - the Chicken Schwarma bowl is my favorite - throw in that Tzatziki - pickled onions - throw it all in! Keep it coming! The chicken is super tender and so well seasoned. I'm in love with the Toum (Garlic) sauce as well.  So the kids meals are only $5.99 - hand crafted mac and cheese with chicken on top - plus a cookie and drink. I tried the mac - rich - toasty and amped up with the Schwarma. Total deal!  I'm also addicted to the Mezze - the Hummus is like silk - delicious silk - the tabouleh salad - so fresh and tasty. And who doesn't love that house made Laffah?   I could eat there every day of the week - tons of variety - lots of flavors - food you can recognize! I know - I probably used too many exclamation points in this review but Yafo deserves a 5 pound bag of them!!!",

We happened to be in Plaza Midwood for lunch one weekday, and decided to try this relatively new location.    Parking is sufficient now, but I can only imagine the difficulty parking in this small lot when Snooze opens later in June.  And there's a note on the door not to park across the street in the Organic Harvest lot, or risk getting booted.  Just be careful when parking here.  Onto the food....my husband and I both ordered their salad bowls.  I used spinach and added cucumbers, tomatoes, babaganoush, hummus, falafel, and lemon tahini.  My husband got grilled chicken on his.  They serve their bowls with delicious warm bread.  While I'm trying to limit my intake of white bread, I did have a few bites, and it was just lovely.  They made my falafel fresh and it was outstanding.  So much better than Cava's falafel!  Their hummus and baba are also delicious - both having a fresh lemony flavor.  We both enjoyed our lunch very much.  Yafo is a bit pricey, hence only four stars for me.  Our two bowls with tap water were $23.85.  Regardless, it was a delicious lunch, however, and we'll absolutely be back.",

I think it is pretty affordable for the quality of the food.   I would go to Yafo before Chipotle any day now as I don't feel guilty ! The food is high quality and they have a lot of options to choose from in order to build your perfect bowl, salad or wrap.

Even if you're planning on eating there - its the same container anyway.  Parking is also tough, so you might need to walk a bit. The front lot is not ideal for cars over compact size.  Food - Chipotle style where you order your base and then toppings follow. This allows you to really customize your choice to your pallet, I love this part.   Really, I've tried all the combos, but the hummus and rice combo as the base is one of my favorites, it's the right amount of both to not overwhelm the other flavors.   I try to get as many veggies as possible, they all have good flavor and what you'd expect out of mediterranean style common dishes found around the US. This consistency is something I am a fan of.   Meats, I prefer the lamb as it has a lot of flavor. Can be a little greasy, but I think it's still by far the best.   At checkout you can get a spicy green oil based sauce to pour over the top, I recommend that for the extra (big) kick.   People are nice but assumptive that you've been to their establishment before (there are other locations in Charlotte). Just be sure to explain if its your first time and you'd like help or else they will just look at you and wait for you to tell them what to do. :)  It seems clean, the decor is nice and there are lots of tables. Absolutely love all the YAFO's!",

The fun drinks you can get like coconut lime was awesome, and probably my favorite part. The biggest issue is the price, with 3 rice bowls and one wrap, and 4 drinks it came out to be 60 bucks. For a \"fast\" food place I don't recommend going here to save money. Basically it's a chipotle of Mediterranean food.",

    "text": "I love this place!! The idea of getting healthy, fresh flavors just as quickly as you would a burger or pizza , you won't feel guilty about is amazing. Too much of anything is never any good but indulging here is not one you will regret.   The overall vibe is modern as is the approach in way of the ordering process. You walk up, you can order straight off their menu or with so many choices of sides, you customized to your taste.   I ordered the falafel on a pita with the red pickled onions and no pickles. I got a side of the cilantro dressing, it was amazing. They do have other sauces to choose from and all the options are fantastic. The side of roasts cauliflower was DEVINE, light, flavorful and waistline friendly . My friend ordered the falafel the way it was on the menu, in a bowl with couscous.   I can't wait to go back and try more items, well done!!!",

    "text": "So good! I had a 5 hour layover waiting for coworkers to come to town and I stopped by Yafo because I like to eat as healthy as possible on the road, and I'm vegetarian. It was perfect. I make really healthy food at home and it exceeded my expectations. Great service, clean restaurant area, and really delicious bowl with a lot of options. I had a greens bowl with baba ghanoush and hummus plus falafel. I usually expect to pay more for extra sauces and toppings but everything I got was included. Sooo delicious. I wish we had more options like this in WA state. And the chef/manager came out to make sure everything was good and asked what could be done to improve my meal. I couldn't think of anything!! This place is bomb. If I lived here I would be in all the time!  Only thing I would improve as always is organic produce and sustainable drinks are and to go containers.",
