One of the workers walked through the line and took orders. I felt that this shortened the wait time. It was my first time, so it was a little hectic trying to decide on what to order. I decided to top my cinnamon roll with raspberry sauce and sprinkles. Payments are taken at one window on an IPad and then there's another window for order pickup. I thought that my order was pretty good. I plan on coming back to try other combinations. I didn't have a chance to fully check out the ambiance of the store but it seems pretty simple. The only downside was the bottled lemonade. I thought that the price was a little much. It was $2 for 10.5 Fl Oz. The taste was not appealing to me either. I had an overall great experience and would recommend others to try Cinnaholic!",

I'm a bit of a peanut butter snob but the frosting was great, and the peanut butter cups were soft and tasted like chocolate peanut butter fudge. I will be back with the family ASAP!

For $5 you can  purchase enough flour, sugar and cinnamon spice to make dozens and dozens of your own home baked deliciousness.  My congrats to the founders of Cinnaholic and their franchisees to understand their target market and serve them well.",

The overall look inside was very intriguing. The Employees were very nice, As a first timer I usually like to be informed on the product and the Employees did not disappoint. Other than that I really enjoyed it there, you won't be disappointed. Also I got the Cookie Monster and it was excellent!!!",

He notified everyone before me and after me of the wait time of 6 minutes and asked them if that was OK for them and if they mind waiting.  When he took my order he NEVER gave me the same courtesy he provided to them.  Being intelligent and not jumping to conclusions,  I thought to myself maybe everyone before me ordered something different. So I asked, 'whats the wait time'? He responded 5 to 6 minutes or so.  Never asked he if I mind waiting or that work for ME.  So I stepped back and observed him taking orders after mine. Just to be sure. And again they were provided an explanation and an option.  I was the only African American in the store.  I haven't experienced selective racism in a long time.  For the record I love ALL people and we are raising our children to love ALL people.  And we (my family) and I will unapologeticly call out and expose any form of racism we experience, especially at an establishment where we spend our money.  $75 per week at this establishment for example. When you know better you will do better..",

I added fresh strawberries to my order this time and they put about 4 pieces of chopped strawberry ???

    "text": "We were SO excited about trying this place out. We drove almost an hour for this special treat. It was super busy, but that was to be expected and not a big deal. We ordered 4 different cinnamon rolls and three of us ate them. Unfortunately... Two of them ended up in the trash and we managed to somewhat eat the others. We are plant based and used to eating things without dairy/animal products... So I wasn't expecting a miracle.. just a yummy treat.   The cream cheese frosting just has a funky taste, almost like fake banana? The brownies were hard and also thrown away :(. The almond frosting was... yuck!!! The best one out of the four was the maple Frosting with cookie dough and caramel. So so sad. If I had to do it again, I'd order a plain cinnamon roll. The middle of the rolls were fine and I did eat that part after I took the toppings off.  We also were charged for an extra cinnamon roll that we didn't order. Thankfully before we left and reviewed the receipt we were able to go back, and they said they credited our account. So again, not a big deal.  The place is super cute and the display case makes you want to order everything - but the taste test failed to impress.  Price: Base price was $4.75, to get a frosting is an additional $0.25, and each topping is $0.50.",

Second step is selecting as many wonderful toppings your little heart desires: cookie dough, sauces, pretzels, fresh fruits...it's ridic   They have other items as well; brownies, cookies. We also tried the edible cookie dough with s'mores topping. Was overly sweet for me personally, but I just housed the CR and saved this one for my husband.   They're advertised as gourmet CRs which is spot on and they're also vegan (I would've never know). The CRs are pricey at $4.75 + $.50 per topping, but 100% worth it.

We both thought they were good and we did not think they were too sweet.  My friend got the vanilla icing with cookie dough and chocolate drizzle and it was too sweet for her to finish eating.  I would suggest if getting the cookie dough maybe avoiding the vanilla icing as people seem to have been commenting it is too sweet. The cinnamon rolls were warm and gooey - I didn't find that they were dry as some have commented.  I'll definetely be back and look forward to the other proposed Charlotte openings.",

I'd say that despite being Vegan, and tasting slightly different, it is still delicious. Cinnaholic is a little more pricey. Mainly because there is a charge for each topping you add. I ended up paying about $7 for my roll yesterday. They do have a lot of toppings to choose from so at least you won't get bored of just one or two options. There are several table/chairs inside and one bathroom. They do offer complimentary water which is always good. I'll def be coming here again.",

The to go cup of icing is more than enough, you only use about half a container for each roll.

I'm so happy to be able to say we have one. The cinnamon rolls are amazing. You can create your own for a base price of $4.25 and then choice of frosting is .25 cents and each topping is .50 cents. I got the create your own and got the cream cheese frosting with strawberries. The berries were very fresh and the consistency of the frosting was perfect as well as the cinnamon bun melting in your mouth.  The cinnamon roll isn't to rich or sweet, it doesn't cause you to feel full or fell like you overindulge when you normally eat a cinnamon roll. I definitely will be back. They offer cookie dough,and brownies as well. They also have a wild selection drinks as well to wash down your cinnamon bun. Oh and Everything is vegan.   There is a reward system for you to sign up for and you get a free cinnamon bun for your next visit when signing up for loyalty.",

Im told cinnaholic was on shark Tank and I must say if I had seen the pitch I too would have bought in.   When you walk in the space is small but it's really all they need. You get the option to build your own cinnamon bun with choices in your icing and then your toppings. I sing options include peanut butter, Carmel, almond, orange glaze, vanilla, chocolate, mint, cream, strawberry, cream cheese... You get the picture. Now we're onto the toppings and that list is even longer than you can imagine from Oreos to nuts, from sweet things to salty things you take your pick. You will have a fear of making a bad decision, but I just don't think it's possible!   They also offer healthy dairy free drink options, teas and coffee... I have a mad amount of respect for companies that don't push sodas.   If you're living in Charlotte and your curious if this place is worth the drive the answer is yes and if you need a friend to go with you I'll gladly meet you there... It's so good and I am a vegan with a raging sweet tooth so how can I not love as good vegan cinnamon bun?!",

It is a little bit \"removed\" from Charlotte... but for a short drive, the payoff is well worth it if you have a friend that's vegan or you yourself are one, the vegan options in Charlotte are few and far between.  This location is in Wesley Chapel, which has been experiencing a lot of growth lately.  The shopping center is fairly new... I think I only knew it as a movie theater location, but it's good to see more buildings and businesses are filling in around it.  Walked in during the afternoon and the nice lady at the register greeted us and gave us the spiel on how everything worked with the menu.  A few minutes later, we were gorging ourselves with cinnamon rolls.  Probably could have shared one, but I figured since we came all the way out there... may as well try 2 different rolls.  Tried the original - YUM and their cookie monster.... which ended up being super decadent and heavy... but if you are a fan of cookie dough, this will not disappoint.    The shop is a typical size strip mall shop... a handful of tables around.  There were some teenagers hanging out in the corner.... I guess this is the 2018 version of Dairy Queen when I was growing up.  Water is available, but they also carry other choices for drinks in a cooler.  Their display case had Avengers: Infinity War inspired concoctions... which I thought was novel.  Overall a great experience... I would come back to try their thousands of combinations when you customize a roll or two.",

So when they opened I made firm plans to get there, come Hell or high water.  Well...I guess I should've factored in miles because for as long as they've been opened, today was my first visit. I literally had planned workouts around their opening, it was that serious.   So I walk in today and you'd think I had never seen ANY of their Instagram posts of all of the yummy toppings because I stood there in complete awe and confusion about what to order.  I had to pick up one for my partner so I kept it simple with cream cheese frosting and pretzels. She loved it! Mine was the same frosting but wit brownie bites! It was difficult not to eat the entire thing in one sitting, but I managed.  I say all of that to say...get one, or two. Now!",

The ordering system they have set up seemed pretty efficient as I got my cinnamon buns in less than 5 minutes after I ordered! (And fresh out the oven)   It seemed if an order had an extended wait, it was because the buns were baking.  I got a tub of cookie dough out the fridge they have, two custom cinnamon buns and a cup of oat milk. (I wanted unsweetened almond milk but they only have sweetened or chocolate option for almond)  (I am not vegan, by the way) I thought the buns were good, just a bit dry.  I was a bit disappointed because the buns were so hot and I was ready for a nice warm moist bite!!   I built my bun with Horchata frosting and topped it with almonds and blue berries.  The Horchata frosting was amazing!  The second bun in my party had regular frosting with caramel syrup and brownie bites. It was very sweet to me, but I don't normally get caramel things. The cookie dough seemed sweet to me as well.  The staff was friendly. Almost everyone thanked me for waiting and stopping by.  I had a 40 minute drive - don't think I'll get a craving and feel the need to out my way to come by but if I'm ever on that side of town again - count me in! (I love cinnamon rolls)",

Not only was the food delicious, but the manager that helped us was so helpful in that she explained how the ordering process worked as it was our first time, and also made sure that we had cold water, and even got us our utensils after bringing us our rolls. Such great service and just such a great atmosphere to hang out and enjoy such a great product! They also offered free WiFi and had some board games and chess available for entertainment.

    "text": "Last night we were across the way at Sun Valley 14 to see Green Book.  When we came out, Cinnaholic was closed.  And I fretted and frowned.   The amazing, wonderful, loving and patient mother that I was given, tired from a long day at work, agreed to make the drive back this evening.  True to her word , we made the 20min drive along Old Charlotte.  On a rainy night no less. Upon entry, we were greeted by a charming young woman with a gracious smile and she was genuine.  Mind was already made up having scoured through all of the photos on yelp last night and today.  Already knew what I wanted. 1) Old Skool for dad, and 2) Hazelnut with Fresh Strawberries and Almonds.  Really I was prepared to treat all of us, but mom claimed she didn't want one (that's code for : I'm going to eat some of yours).   Only 2 more days before returning to the West Coast, maybe I can squeeze in One More visit before Monday. By the time we made it back to the house, they were still warm, surprisingly.  Though I had to give it an honorary nuke for no more than 10 seconds.  It was perfect. Not to sweet, light, fluffy and First Day Fresh.  If only they had one of these in USC Village or dtla, everything would be right with the world.  Thank you again to the gracious young woman. With Gratitude and Blessings.",

Soon as it touched down, we were right there... in line... building our own cinnamon roll. It's basically your Chiptole of cinnamon rolls, just vegan and the best part of it all is it doesn't even taste vegan at all!!! I'm not a vegan so coming from me says a lot lol. The staff is always friendly, place is clean and the playlist is awesome!  The only downfall to this place is the location. It's not in the heart of Charlotte and I'm not sure how they even found this location in Indian trail, but if it was closer to Charlotte's metro area then a lot more people would be there! We drive about 30-35 min one way just to enjoy a vegan cinnamon roll... but then again it's probably a good thing because if it was closer, then I'd be eating the m waaaaay often than I need to.   Overall, great concept, a good dessert and less fattening(maybe lol---- dairy/egg free). Sounds like a winner to me!",

I LOVE this place, I follow the business on FB as they won Shark Tank and is based West Coast. Imagine the joy I felt once I read they were coming to NC and being Vegan it was even more exciting as I don't get many Vegan GOOD dessert choices here. I don't eat dessert often but when I do I would like something tasty and memorable.  This place fits the bill both tasty and memorable. There are so many options and combinations you can do with the icing flavor and the toppings that you will keep coming back to try the next and the next and the next (at least that's my excuse for multiple visits plus I've taken out of town guest.  This place was a madhouse my first 3 visits as it was still SUPER new. It was a little better as far as crowd by visit 4 and super easy in and out on visit 5 which was this past weekend.  I enjoyed the Queen City roll on grand opening day and our toddler had the Birthday cake roll which he gets every visit now. My husband favorite is orange icing with walnuts. I've had lemon and coconut as well as vanilla and almonds.  Overall this place is a keeper",

So when I was meeting people at Cinnaholic, I was not too enthused, I was going to be social.   They looked amazing, I was still in 'this could be a bunch of fake stuff mode.' I tasted the ooey gooey rolls, wait..... they did not have that weird after taste. I stand corrected.  After talking on Instagram later, I found out  100% Vegan, dairy free, lactose free, egg free, cholesterol free and you can top it with dairy free gelato from Artisen. (Equdorian gelato, shop in Matthews)   If I would have known this before hand I might have been a little judgey because I do love some butter. But I would rather have this cinnamon roll over chain or pop out of can.   Tip: get icing on the side and reheat at home for take away.",

They have cookies and Cinnamon rolls. The price is contingent upon the toppings you choose and the amount of toppings. They are paperless. The only issue is they do not give paper receipts. You can give your phone number or email. Both are dangerous to give because I gave my email for a receipt and now I get emails all the time. I attempted to unsubscribe, but they keep coming. It's so annoying. A friend put her number and following it she gets texts. When I pushed to get my receipt on their tablet I know I checked for fine print to ensure I un-checked the small font box so they would not contact me and they still do. So be prepared just to not have a receipt or be annoyed. I understand the whole go green thing, but if you are please don't spam me! The chocolate chip cookie was good. Other then the receipt issue it is nice to try. Enjoy!",

It's a build your own cinnamon roll shop with a huge variety of options from icings and toppings you can get your creative on with. I rolled with the classic cream cheese icing, gobs of cookie dough, and peanut butter cups. According to the owner of the shop, Michelle, this combination is a first that she's ever seen and she told me she will definitely be making that again for herself after work. It sure was delicious, and I enjoyed every bite of the soft, sweet cinnamon roll. Their dough is prepped every 3-4 hours and the cinnamon rolls take 20 minutes to make. If any cinnamon rolls are left sitting out for over 30 minutes, they toss them and prepare new ones to keep the freshness for their customers. That's why my cinnamon roll was so soft. Cinnaholic employees quality control everything they serve taste testing what they put out. (Don't let me work here, I'll become the cinnamon roll monster.) This idea originated on Sharktank and now has become a nationwide franchise. They also just opened some locations in Canada as well. Immediately after crushing my cin, I had to go back up to the counter to create another masterpiece. My second cin was topped with peanut butter icing, fresh banana slices, and Oreo cookies. Michelle was very enthusiastic and loved what she did. She was proud on the fact that everything they offer is made from scratch every morning including the peanut butter cups that I devoured. This place is 100% vegan, but they don't advertise that loudly. There's a small sticker in the corner of the pickup counter glass window stating it's vegan and that's about it. They offer specialty flavors according to season if you choose not to customize your own, but please do customize as that's the fun part. Sweet tooth lovers go find your way to Cinnaholic.",

I stumbled on this place from seeing an instagram post from a blogger, and it's been the best thing. My friend is addicted and now so am I....well now I'm not so sure finding this place is a good thing after all lol. This is how cinnamon rolls should be done! It's a little pricey, but once you have Cinnaholic you're cinnamon roll expectations will be on a whole different level. The coffee dust cookie dough is a hit too, and the customer service is great! The only con is how far out it is  (which still hasn't stopped us from coming). We travel from Concord to Indian Trail because they often have specials that you can't pass up.",

    "text": "Positives: -Concept - it's cool you can customize your cinnamon roll to your liking. -Variety - there are over ten different frostings and over 15 different toppings to choose from. They have fruit or more sweet things like cookie dough. -Staff/store - friendly staff. Everyone had a smile on their face. The store was clean and tidy.  Negatives: -Price - starting out the cinnamon roll is almost $5. Each topping is $.50. For two cinnamon rolls, a green tea and coffee, it was $19. -Taste - maybe because I'm not vegan, I wasn't a fan. I thought the cinnamon roll itself was bland. The toppings weren't very good either. We ended up throwing our cinnamon rolls away after only two bites. We tried the blueberry Pie and cookie dough.  Based on price and taste alone, if you're not vegan, I'd eat a regular cinnamon roll with all the good stuff. For those that are vegan, it's a nice option for a sweet breakfast treat!   Tip: if you don't like a lot of frosting, ask for lite.",

I did a custom cinnamon roll with peanut butter and raspberry icings and marshmallows, strawberry, banana, raspberries, and pie crumble for toppings. It was incredible. The cinnamon roll was gooey and delicious.   There are tons of toppings and icing flavors to choose from. If you're too overwhelmed, they also have premade combinations you can try.  I had a bite of my husband's and friends and they were both amazing as well.   Everything is vegan, but you would never know. I'm not vegan and they were the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had.   I can't wait for them to open up a location closer to Charlotte! It's definitely worth the drive all the way out here. I highly recommend making the trip out to try it!",

We loved the toppings--the flavor combination I chose was peanut butter frosting and cookie dough bites on top of the cinnamon bun. I'm a peanut butter fanatic! Thus I loved the flavors of Peanut goodness wrapped around the cookie dough sweetness.  You can choose a frosting and then as many toppings as you want to include (you pay per topping). I loved my combination and would definitely try the coffee frosting next time. My friend liked her coffee frosting and pie crust toppings. Her roll was very full of cinnamon flavors, which was more like the traditional cinnamon roll idea. Good service, they let you taste the frostings to help decide on a flavor.  I liked the decaf coffee and would love to taste more frostings next trip!! If you have a sweet tooth & are hungry the whole roll is awesome. You could also split the roll with someone.

I was excited to try this place as Ive heard about them on social media and thru my friends.    The location is cute and modern looking. Not very large of a space, about 6 tables.  We were the only customers there at 7 pm on a Saturday.   Cinnaholic Is neat concept where you can add different toppings but it does get pricy quick. They have about 12-15 different topics (for example: pretzels, fruits, nuts) that you can choose to add to your roll for an up charge. I ordered my cinnamon roll without icing but chose walnuts as my topping.  Cinnamon rolls are doughy and good but WAY TOOOOO sweet for my liking (and that was without any icing)!  They were out of brownies.  I also tried their chocolate chip cookie and it was okay.",

    "text": "After grabbing dinner at Trail House, our friend mentioned that he wanted to try this place - touting the Shark Tank backed themed Vegan cinnabon.  I ordered a bun with Hazelnut icing and walnuts, my wife got a cookie dough.  The buns were made fresh - so they were hot and when we opened the containers up I saw steam, a large bun - while not tall it covered a lot of area - and enough icing for a small wedding cake.  I dove in and took a bite.    First thing is first: Holy Type II diabetes Batman!  Talk about too sweet.  Second - trying just the bun - I liked that it was hot, but while it looked moist, it had a gritty and tasted dry on my pallet.  Not nearly as good as the rave - I have had local bakery, cinnabon, and the standard Pillsbury Dough Boy canned buns that tasted better and didn't cost $6+.    The cookie dough was boring - it tasted like artificially flavored cookie dough, had that same gritty after taste on the pallet, and was just not satisfying.  We through away 80% of what we bought - which hurt since it was a $13 trip when we would have been a lot happier with even a McDonald's ice cream cone.    Maybe it's that they don't use butter, eggs, milk, but whatever it is, Cinnaholic didn't do anything to help me want to eat vegan.  Shark Tank or not - wasting $13 at Cinnaholic gave me nothing but buyers remorse.  So many better choices out there for desert.",

As with many \"build your own\" places, you are assaulted by way too many choices - but luckily they have some rather simple options, and that's where I went. As it turns out, it was pretty darn good.  The only real complaint that I had is that it was rather heavy on the icing. Cut that in half (at least) and I'd probably be a huge fan. Perhaps not enough to drive this far to get another, but if I were in the area again, I'd definitely give it a go (and incidentally, I think you can order it light on the icing).",

The staff was really nice, I ordered a classic old skool cinnamon roll, no brownies, fruit special type of frosting, just regular scmegular roll.  I have to say that it was pretty good.  Nothing super special about it, just a roll with vanilla frosting.  I would give it 5 stars, but its not the best roll i've had.  I think it is a good place to get a sweet snack if you are in the area.  I wouldn't drive an 1 hour like some reviews, but definitely if you are in the area stop by and get you a roll.",

They truly outdid themselves with their service and even the presentation of the food! They remembered my friend and I when we came back in too! Wish more places treated customers as this dynamic duo does!",

    "text": "Delicious!! I would recommend trying the icing first before ordering  (The staff was more than accommodating considering I tried Cream cheese, hazelnut, lemon, Raspberry and Cake batter icing before ordering). I didn't end up liking any of the icings. They were all very sweet and had a weird flavor to them. That being said I got a small amount of Vanilla with Cookie dough and Strawberries on top. The roll was fantastic. Although I really could just come back for the cookie dough by itself.the staff was awesome and the roll was delicious. Will be back!",

    "text": "I wondered what a vegan cinnamon roll would taste like so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm not at all impressed. I got the classic, I think they call it \"old skool,\" and the frosting is disgustingly sweet. I enjoy sweets but this is way too sweet. The dough is odd. I can't quite put my finger on it other than it has an odd flavor and a very doughy texture, almost as if it wasn't thoroughly cooked. The cinnamon roll left a film in my mouth after eating it and has made my stomach hurt. I'm   If you're aiming to have a healthy eating lifestyle, this is NOT the way to go - even if it is vegan. I understand splurging once in a while but with 730 calories, 600mg of sodium and 59g of sugar, I suggest splurging another way that tastes better. UPDATE: After the very passive aggressive reply by the manager of Cinnaholic, I definitely do NOT recommend this place. I refuse to give my business or a positive review to a place that employees such passive aggressive people. I have every right to post my thoughts and experiences about an establishment, after all that is what Yelp is all about. If Terri C. can't handle an honest review that doesn't support her establishment, then maybe it's best for her to get out of the food industry.",

The actual cinnamon roll was very good in my opinion. Not a huge fan of that particular icing though. The whole cinnamon roll was too overpowering and sugary. Definitely check it out but get the basic cinnamon roll or basic cookie dough. The added toppings overall just makes it not great.",
