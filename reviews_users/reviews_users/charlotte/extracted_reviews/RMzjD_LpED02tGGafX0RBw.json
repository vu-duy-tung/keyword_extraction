In truth I \"appreciate\" but do not prefer, the more popular, local vinegar/mustard based sauces.  Regardless of sauce preference, my criticism was that City's pork tasted steamed; actually overly-tender, apparently from moisture rather than from hours over wood.  My best advice - keep heading south on Johnson Road for five minutes to Jim & Nicks; (near Lowes parking lot) for real hickory smoke style meat; smoke so heavy its hard to wash from your hands!",

    "text": "Hubby and I went to City Bar B Que and it was delicious. It is located in the Ballentyne area on Hwy 521 behind the Walgreens. I ordered shredded pork, potato salad, and baked beans. There is plenty of food so we decided to take home  a peach cobbler. We were very impressed and have now been there another 3-4 times. I personally like a variety of flavors in my meals so this place is excellent. You get a variety of BBQ sauces from which to choose for your meat. The potato salad is creamy and not mustardy but if you want some, you can get a packet at the condiments corner.  The baked beans are sweet and just perfect in my opinion. We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge. I actually prefer it cold better than warm.  The corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion. There is a small loaf of cornbread that is good and honey is found in packets at their condiments corner. Every time we go there, nice young men circulate the room to be sure your food satisfies you. My hubby and I have settled on this as our favorite place to eat BBQ. They cater and we will surely be using them for that. The prices seem very reasonable for catering. You can leave your dirty dishes on the table to be bussed but I usually bus my own to leave more room for the next customers. We have previously eaten at 521 BBQ and Jim n Nicks and this City Bar B Q is better than they are.",

The person who takes your order was not very friendly nor did he give the proper attention to the customer. While taking our order he was having a side conversation with someone else. The restaurant was dirty, they have bottles of sauce on every table in squeeze bottles that are transparent however they clearly do not clean the bottles, there was dried old sauce on the tops and in the tip were the sauce comes out. They have a fixing bar also with sauce and it is not very clean either burnt sauce caked in the open containers. See my pictures..... the food was not hot at all. You would expect being a new restaurant that it would be very clean but that's not the case at all. Very disappointing!!!",

I have been continously disappointed by the quality of brisket the other local competitors offer, so it was a treat to have it done right   We also got ribs, which were very tasty.  The sides were good, and the service was friendly and fast.  Some people may be turned off by the stand and order set up, but a lot of the best bbq places are designed that way.  I thought it ran very smoothly.  It is definitely worth a visit.  Johnston and 521 is becoming ultra competitive for BBQ, but this place will get repeat business from me, and if you want good brisket, this is my top pick.",

I made 2.5 big meals out of the two meat plate and a few sides.  The corn pudding was especially good as were the collard greens. The ribs were large, meaty, and not too greasy.

Baked beans were ok but be warned very sweet and sugary. Overall, the focus should be on the BBQ and it was forgettable.",

My chicken was raw in the middle, the ribs were dry and over sauced. The mac and cheese tasted like some kind of imitation cheese product and salt. The sweet barbecue sauce was just bitter molasses. The only decent thing I had were the hush puppies...and they were only decent.  They gave me free banana pudding due to my long wait for hush puppies.  Haven't tried it yet but I am not hopeful.

It melted in my mouth, absolutely delicious.  Everyone was VERY friendly and we never felt ignored as others have stated.    We went about 8pm on a Monday night, place wasn't dead but it wasn't packed either.  We ended up taking half the food home with us for lunch the next day because we were all stuffed.  When you factor that in it cost us about $6 a piece per meal.  Not too shabby!",

So I said forget it walked outside with a s8 with full coverage never dropped a call. Called city bbq. The first lady young will call her \"I am doing my nails  she said 3 times can not hear you and hung up. 6) So I called back go some one else that connected me with a Mr ccccbbbvgc could not pronounce his name .Then a Manager came on with.( Do not bother me attitude)  I gave up.",

Well, that changed this weekend - and for the good!    After nearly a year, we decided to go back and try it again. We got the turkey and the sausages. Wow, this place has gotten good. Took the food home and it was hot - major issue the first couple of times.  The turkey was juicy and tender. So good!  But the sausages - oh man, the sausages, were money!! So much so, we've talked about it all day the following day about how we can't wait to get them again. Service seemed much better and more polite.

Their staff is very well trained on their whole menu I was very impressed.  They let you order anything which was great it wasn't a selected menu this a great idea all places should do this before opening Kudos:) They have lots of southern sides green beans which were really good. They have fried Okra , collards , baked beans an Mac an cheese. They have Brisket which they were out of tonight no surprise I'm sure it was amazing . I had the pulled pork , 1/4 chicken white . The BBQ was on point nice smokey flavor. I didn't use any sauce they have several flavors to choose from .  I didn't care for the collards they were very salty I think it was the Bbq mixed in I'd suggest leave that out . They do have fresh cut fries excellent choice. I did try the fried I like fried okra fried hard but this had a good breading but the Okra to me wasn't really done but some people like it that way. I didn't try the Mac n cheese I'm a southern girl I know my Mac n cheese . I always ask if it's home made an sad to say a lot of places go cheap to cut cost an use that powder cheese . I asked the young lady at the counter an she said it's not really home made n has that powder. I'd just assume that be taken off the menu honey or let me in there an show you to make home made baked mac n cheese:) all in all I think this new BBQ place will do great . It's actually in the Publix parking lot easy to find. I did try their chocolate cake I can't brag enough it's almost like a devils food very moist with a chocolate icing an chocolate mini morsels. They were out of peach cobbler bummer but they also have Banana Pudding now they make it there on site but it has a twist to it. It's not your southern Pudding it's a little crunchy not vanilla wafers an cool whip an the have Carmel in it. Not for me but some folks might like that . Cute atmosphere an a nice outdoor seating the prices are right on target . I was told they also make their own fresh squeezed lemonade yum. Check them them an make them feel at home here in Charlotte .",

    "text": "I absolutely love BBQ and would consider myself somewhat of a BBQ snob. While Charlotte certainly has plenty of BBQ restaurants, most are not memorable, objectively bad, and just not worth visiting. So, when friends and family started telling me about City BBQ, a chain nonetheless, I really was not expecting much. I was more than pleasantly surprised, though.  SERVICE Like a fast food joint, you order your food at the counter and then pick it up once it's ready. Unlike a fast food join, the employees here are actually friendly and (at least seem to) enjoy their jobs.  FOOD I'll start with where City BBQ shines: the meat. After sampling some of the bland BBQ that Charlotte has to offer, you might come into City BBQ and ask yourself what this strange flavor is. It's wood smoke. And City BBQ uses different types of wood for each meat, the way it's supposed to be done. In addition to pulled pork, City also serves brisket (not real BBQ), chicken (also not real BBQ), and ribs. All four meats taste great and are served with plenty of bark (unless you get chicken, which is not real BBQ). I believe they also serve sausage, but I have not tried it.  The side items are also worth noting. City has the typical BBQ restaurant sides like fries and slaw, but they also have a few others such as fried okra and corn pudding. They all taste great and come in fairly generous portions.  Each table comes with a few bottles of City's own BBQ sauce, and there is even a condiment bar with more. City also has thickly-sliced pickles, jalepenos, and red onions. Oh, and they have plenty of wet wipes in case eating your ribs get a bit messy (or if you're eating chicken, which isn't real BBQ).  PRICES City's prices are in line with other BBQ places, which tend to be around $15 per meal. I would consider that pretty fair.  Overall, I really enjoyed City and have been back. My only real complaint is their menu layout. Every time I go, there is always someone in line who does not understand that everything is ordered separately. City, throw a combo with a meat and a side up there to move things along and to avoid the \"what do you mean my meat doesn't come with a side\" talk.  PRO TIP: before you go, download the app and sign up for an account. You get a free drink on your first visit and then $5 off your next meal for every $100 you spend. If you have a family, this is essentially $5 off every other visit.",

Wife had a pulled pork sandwich with hush-puppies/mac & cheese. I had the two meat option (brisket/ribs) with corn pudding/baked beans.  Pulled pork: Was not overcooked (usual complaint with restaurant pulled pork), decent bark, light smoke, not much flavor overall - 6/10  Ribs: Cooked well, clean bite without pulling away from the bone, good rub, light smoke - 8/10  Brisket: This was supposed to be the heavy hitter, but fell flat on its face. Good bark, strong beef flavor, overcooked, dry, dry, dry, and dry. Asked for a mix of fatty/lean, received only lean brisket that crumbled to dust just by looking at it - 3/10   Hush-puppies - They are hush-puppies done well. Simple and effective - 8/10  Mac & Cheese - Stove top style, creamy, mild flavors, average overall - 6/10  Baked Beans -  Sweet enough to be dessert, decent seasoning, packed with large chunks of brisket, and was unable to eat more than a few bites due to sweetness - 4/10  Corn Pudding - Smooth, creamy, savory, sweet. Great side that will not disappoint - 9/10  Sauces across the board - Very sugar forward, tastes commercially produced, meh - 5/10",

Quick service, nice folks at the counter.   We got our sandwiches and they looked very promising with a nice mixture of meat and burnt end pieces.  First bite was AWFUL and it went downhill from there.  The BBQ was soooo wet, almost mushy to eat.  Took several more bites and no better.  The meat had almost no smoke flavor, just wet and spongy.  We tossed both sandwiches in the trash.    The hand cut fries were good.  The ice tea was delicious!    We will not be going back ever.  Yuck...this was not good at all.",

I'm not a big fan of Carolina BBQ Sauce, and their alternatives were very basic. Tasty, but nothing special. I mixed three of them together to get a good Sauce.   However, I am still ravings about their sides!  They need some good onion rings, but the fries, greens, corn pudding, and hush puppies I tried were phenomenal.   A negative for me that they serve Pepsi, not Coke, but that really is a small think compared to the quality of the food. Pretty dang good spot. And the tunes were nice as well, with some Memphis Blues giving it a nice Honky Tonk vibe.   Definitely should be on your list in Charlotte.",

My hubby went for the two meat sampler with brisket and ribs with collard greens and their bbq gumbo. Incredible!

If you are looking for some great not just good bbq this is it.  I like to wait to make my reviews just so I don't become impulsive.  I also just saw that a yelp event was here I am so jealous!!  I was not given the opportunity to discover this place before now.  Sorry DoorDash but next time I am going in person.  I ordered the Pulled Pork w/Bun and Fresh Cut Fries.    Those fries tho... LAWWWWWWD  they were so fresh and just right and there was so many.  I could have taken some home but they never made it I tore them down!  The sandwich/that pork was just crazy and I mean crazy stupid in a good way because it takes a lot for some food to really have me excited like this to the point my heart rate is racing just thinking about it.  It was so good I mean I have not had bbq this good in probably 2 or 3 years.  I had them bring me 2 sides of the Sweet BBQ sauce and I was again blown away at how good and authentic it tastes.  Put's a LOT of other sauces to shame.  I almost shed a tear and I was saying to myself I have got to review this place because it blew me away.  They say that they give \"the same attention they would give to their own family\" I really believe that because the only person that really made BBQ this good in my past was my grandma and grandpa at their bbq pit.    This food took me back and I thought about my Maw Maw who passed away she always made sure I had everything I needed and was always trying to feed me even when I was slam packed full.  The portions here are very generous so at first I though the prices were high but they are COMPLETELY acceptable for the quality and care that goes into the food. They have one in Ballantyne (the one I ordered from) and in Matthews.  I heard they are building one in another part of Charlotte as well.  I hope that they all do their food to perfection because this is the way it's supposed to be.   I told DoorDash to ask for extra napkins because I'm messy so they really put some extra napkins in there and they are QUALITY napkins like not that cheap mess they are custom printed and will open up to be able to cover your whole top part of your shirt yeah they are nice.  They hooked me up with extra so now when someone needs a napkin I give that out and tell them about City Barbeque.  You guys deserve it and please keep up the fantastic work I can't wait to bring friends and family in!  My only problem is I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "If you think the best barbecue is usually found in the worse part of town, in a place with    bars on the windows and just enough grease on the table to write your initials, then you'd be wrong.  And you'd be wrong again if you think you can't find good cue in a  stand alone brick building in a shopping center complex in Charlotte.  The place is City Barbecue; and while this guy who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue is not ready to shout, \"this is it,\" - it is pretty darn good.  What's also surprising is that \"it\" is part of a  regional chain.  No franchisees, all company owned, and each \"joint\" doing everything from  cutting the fries to rubbing the brisket at their own location.  The Brown Shoe Gourmet has enjoyed barbecue (some a lot more than others) from Times Square to San Diego and written Yelp reviews for more than 90 'Cue stops and doesn't give five stars but to a select few  but City Barbecue in Charlotte has now been added to the list.  And here's why:  Their brisket is just a quarter inch short of the brisket at Righteous Barbecue in Marietta , Georgia, and an eight of an inch shy of  the gold standard set by Luling City Market Barbecue and Blacks Barbecue just south of Austin, Texas, where it's all about brisket.  Enough smoke in the flavor so you know it was cooked low and slow over hickory; moist so you know that thin layer of layer of fat was left on for flavor, juicy and tender so you know that they really did smoke it for14, 15 or 16 hours at somewhere around 200.  While the brisket is the best item on the City Barbecue menu, the ribs, chicken and pork are all in competition for runner-up.   Folks who don't know any better, often boast about the meat falling off the bone when they have ribs.  If the meat is falling off the bone, that means it was either par boiled, baked or under the heat lamp too long. Good ribs (they feature  St. Luis cut) require you pick 'em up, get sauce all over your fingers and munch away.  The chicken was crisp on the outside, moist and tasting very good inside. One at our table said it was the best they ever had.  The Pork was a tad on the dry side. Good flavor, but maybe too close to closing.  And with the platters, two small loaves of delicious cornbread. Life is good.  A couple of the sides are killers. Hand cut fries and a super tangy vinegar slaw. Baked beans were  like a lot of others. Did not try the corn pudding, Mac and cheese, or green beans with bacon. Next time.  Sauces? Six of them. Fellow we guessed was the manager, Shane Wolfe, gave us the rundown. Here's our take on them: Not all great, but then sauces are a matter of taste, pun intended. For mine, their \"swine wine,\"  was excellent: vinegar based, some flecks of red pepper - just right for the pulled pork. Their sweet sauce was too; the mustard based was roughly average; their \"brush fire\" was good if you like hot, and City Barbecue's \"original\" was right on for the ribs and chicken.  If you  read the walls on the way to the restrooms, you'll see that the founders, like the Brown Shoe Gourmet, have made various barbecue tours seeking to savor 'cue at the meccas of this all-American food group. There are pictures of them at Abe's in Clarksville, Arthur Bryants and Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, Luling in Texas - all of which we've visited and reviewed as well.    Shane also made sure we didn't check out without checking out a super chocolate desert cake and a world class banana pudding - topped with sliced bananas and caramel. Don't leave without trying and probably sharing.  Barbecue is a hard food to replicate without losing character and quality... anyone remember Famous Dave's? Sonnys? Slopes in Atlanta? And the list goes on... but City Barbecue, coming out of the world renown barbecue State of Ohio, is doing it right... and it is good;very.   Five Stars and we'll be back next time in Charlotte.",

Truth be told, the meat alone would warrant a 3 star review; for context, Sauceman's is the only BBQ in the city worthy of a 4.5 star review, with Midwood coming in at a 3.5 - 4. But the sides are horrifically bad. Mac and cheese that tastes like it's made with processed cheese. Tasteless fried okra. Cornbread that tastes like it comes from a box.   On the bright side, the sauces are good, so grab some to go and get better smoked meat elsewhere.",

The Manager took really good care of us and we are \"Stealz\" members so Nancy had a complimentary Banana Pudding AJ even fresh made Nancy's Pudding as they had run out of it -- which she said she would go there just for that. She had the smoked Chicken and said it was better then Midwoods -- I had a Pulled Pork sandwich which the sauce was good but it lacked the \"Smoked\" flavor. -- over all we had a very good experience and would go again. Service wise they had it all over Midwoods and was reasonably priced.",

Being a barbecue connoisseur from my home state of Alabama and have eaten barbecue all over the country I was really excited. When I finally got there I was expressed with the atmosphere and the staff was absolutely down home friendly. However the ordering from the menu was quite confusing but the staff was very patient with me and walked me through the process. Everything is ala carte so remember if you want fries to order them. When our food finally arrived which was very quick I was ready to dive in. The meat was succulent however the flavor was less than lackluster. There wasn't an obvious smoke taste to the meat and the sauces though they were good just didn't Elevate the meats taste. Their desserts weren't the best either. The chocolate cake was dry and the banana pudding was just ok. However, the manger was the most pleasant person to talk with and the history of the company was amazing to hear.",

We took our friends from California there on Saturday night for authentic local bbq. They shared the city sampler and loved everything on the large plate: pulled pork, brisket, chicken and a few burnt ends. They were not thrilled with the vinegar-y NC sauce, but they were adventurous and tried it. However, there were four additional sauces for them to try, so they enjoyed the sweet sauce. Others in our party had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw. There was a choice of vinegar dressing or creamy, but we chose creamy. It was delicious. The cornbread was good and the hush puppies solidly tasted of onion as they should. All tables in the place were filled so there was a bit of a lag in cleaning tables so others could sit.",

I had ordered the half slab of pork ribs. It was delicious! You know my wife was mad since she had ordered the pulled chicken..which was good..but it could not match my ribs..nope..no way. Her pulled chicken didn't even come with a sauce. So before I left this restaurant (I had to wait at the pick up area since I had ordered the food online)...they had 4 bowls of different sauces. So make sure you take the time to fill a few small plastic cups of the different sauces. My wife only liked the Molasses sauce which helped improve the taste of her pulled chicken.  We got sides: hush puppies (fried perfectly), mac & cheese (it was \"o k\"), vinegar slaw (delicious) and collards (wife had really enjoyed them). As for dessert..my wife's order was better than mine. She got the peach cobbler, which was awesome. There I was....slowly eating my triple chocolate cake that was average. The cake reminded me of a triple chocolate cake that I had at a diner in Brooklyn not too long ago. This cake didn't have that southern charm to it.   When we go back to NC..I don't care about the nearby fancy pancy restaurants near the hotel. We are going back to City Barbecue!!",

    "text": "Gluten Free- Yes Casein Free - Yes  I have to laugh that whenever I asked for recommendations for a good BBQ place to eat at in town,City BBQ kept popping up.  I find this funny because City BBQ is not only chain restaurant, but it started out in Ohio of all places, so I'm extremely familiar with them.   What makes them 5 Stars? Simple, service, food, and price.  + Service - Extremely friendly and helpful. When ordering and letting them know of my dietary constraints, the person doing the ordering will alert the people preparing my order of my allergies. What that means is that 1. all gloves are changed and 2. if I'm ordering meat, they will use a new piece that hasn't been touch before, especially for the brisket.  + Food - It's fresh and filling because pretty much everything as meat in it. The sides included. A major chuck of the menu is GFCF. Just as for the allergen menu when in doubt.  +Price - For the quality and quantity, it great and won't break your budget or expense account. I mean you could order the side platter, where you pick 3 sides, and a drink and walk out the door for under $10 and a full stomach.    Tips: *They can have a long line at lunch;however, the line moves quickly and you will have your order in no time. Seating inside can become a bit crowed as well. They do have additional seating outside under a covered porch.   *If you dine often, download their app to earn free food.  *The sweet tea is dangerously good, just beware of the sugar rush and crash afterwords.",

The prices are also reasonable. It is nearly impossible to get excellent brisket and two sides for a little over $10 just about anywhere.   They forgot one of our sides one evening. It was applesauce so it was not a big deal but I did not want to drive back for it. I did the survey online and received a call about an hour later. They definitely made it up to us.  Make sure to get the app - they will send you discounts and you can earn rewards, etc. More importantly, get the peach cobbler. It is amazing..",

My sister and my 10 year old niece were visiting and we decided to go here for lunch, as they have gluten free options (my niece has Celiac Disease).  From the get go they were extremely attentive to detail to make sure that my niece didn't get accidentally \"glutened\" and the person taking our order personally made our food and put anything with gluten (hush puppies and texas toast) on separate plates so we didn't have any cross contamination.  They were so accommodating, and the food was excellent.  The three of us split brisket and turkey with a side salad for the niece and mac and cheese and hush puppies for my sister and I.  So good.  I think I'm going to go here for lunch tomorrow.",

Simply, in my humble and chubby opinion, one of the best briskets in the area.  My service experience was also very good.  They seemed to have worked out some of their opening missteps others have Yelped.    PS:  Not a Carolina pork-based BBQ indigenous to the area (case you are wondering).",

First, it is a wait in line to order at the counter kind of place.  Very annoying and trying to decide over baskets or sandwiches, etc. starts your experience off on a bad note.  You pay the cashier and then maneuver toward a dining are amid a sea of wandering patrons.  And IF you can find a cleared table, good for you...you are blessed, but just for a moment.  Another area has drinks, condiments and utensils.  You jostle your way in and out.  Ice machine not spitting out ice, move on.  Finally you regain your island table and take in the trash and food on the floor as well as the overflowing trash receptacles.  Most customers just bus and available table.    And then you await the calling of your name from the busy counter.  You must listen carefully as the noise is just too loud and your name might get consumed by the height of the unfinished ceiling.  Yes...you hear you name and jostle your way through the flow of people entering the dirty table maze to pick up your order.  With all that is the food that good?  Well...if you like fatty meat, that slick oily feeling and having to thoroughly wash your hands than you are truly in hot heaven.     This was lunch.  We are not brave or desperate enough to try dinner.  Nope...on to 521 or Nick n' Jim's down the road.  City is a poor excuse for Southern BBQ or even Texas BBQ.",

Crowded at lunch Moderately prices as entrees come without sides, extra for one or 2  sides. Our smoked chicken with 2 sides  over $30 for lunch. Portions are large. There are lunch specials, less quantity and more reasonable priced. Our smoked chicken was delicious, but not overly smokey, coleslaw standard recipe, baked beans with brisket yummy  but very sweet, and green  beans with bacon good. Staff is friendly and food came out quickly. Standard menu with chicken, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, smoked sausage, smoked turkey,  and sides  such as mac and cheese, potato salad, corn pudding, cornbread, green salad, etc. Crafted beers, sodas and sweet tea etc plus standard fountain beverages. Desserts such as banana pudding, cobblers, chocolate cake, cookies etc They also cater. Ambience comfortable, we would certainly return.  On par with other quality BBQ places we have tried",

    "text": "WOW. This was bad. Most of it ended up in the trash, except for the meat...which I've cleaned up for my Dobe and Doxie.  This was the first time I tried City BBQ in Ballantyne after it being highly recommended. Ordered a Family Pack - which includes 1 lb of the meat of your choice, 4 standard or lunch buns, 2 sides (pints), and cornbread. I chose pulled pork and standard buns.  Went to pick it up and everything was kept in an oven type thing next to the checkout. Thought that was pretty cool. However, when I drove 0.5 miles and got it into the house, it was lukewarm at best.  Service when picking up: the guy was extremely friendly and pulled my order together within a good amount of time. He did ask me...did I want sauce with my order. What? Why would I buy BBQ without sauce? This should be standard. It was not an additional charge, but I was kind of stunned by that question.   The Pork: Their pulled pork is pretty tasty when you can get to it. My order is filled with fatty tissue and flabby skin. I'm not accustomed to that at all. I'd say 1/4 of the 1 lb (I guess) that was included was waste. I actually tried to make a sandwich from the pork and 'original sauce'. Just not good. I've cleaned the pork out for my dogs.   Mac and Cheese: Pretty sure they are using Velveeta. Would never order this again.  Baked Beans with 'Brisket': I had high hopes for this. I found two pieces of brisket in my pint, the rest were skin and fat pieces. Why???  Buns - standard, and kind of dried out Cornbread - standard  I don't get why people are giving this place the thumbs up. :(",

    "text": "While in Charlotte, we had to have barbeque... So my in laws wanted us to check out City Barbeque since they eat at this location often. Off we went, City Barbeque is located in a big shopping center, easy to spot frm the main road, has a big parking lot, the place was mostly empty when we got there.  My father in law couldn't take advantage of their rewards program (as a regular customer), it didn't work well, so he couldn't use a coupon they promised. That's always a bummer. Maybe they should have been more helpful and also make the program simpler.  We got pulled pork sandwiches, which where good, slaw, hush puppies (very good, my favorite part of the meal) and mac and cheese (just OK).   The issue with this place is that even if it's a restaurant, you kinda have to do it all yourself. Get your plates, utensils, sauces (they have a station further from tables). I did enjoy my Carolina mustard sauce, open your beer bottle - got the local brew- Olde Mecklenburg - Amber Ale. We were told to go to some area to open the bottles, had a hard time finding the opener. They can't even open a beer bottle for you, here? At the table with sauces for BBQ  they had another station - with pickles, onion, etc. I really liked their pickles, got my fix, nice and sour.  Customer service was sloppy, they didn't seem to care or be helpful. Same in the restrooms- the ladies one didn't have toilet paper, the men's restroom didn't have paper towels.  The food is OK, but this place should improve their customer service and put less on the customers. It's too hands off for my taste and I'm not a diva!",

I understand this place is a chain of sorts but don't let that stop you from giving them a chance.  The turkey especially is perfectly smoked and moist, my favorite thing here.  The sides are solid, oddly the fries are probably their best offering, perfect natural cut fries.  The pork is decent, the brisket is 8/10 and I love the sausage, fresh, nice snap and tons of flavor.  In case you couldn't tell we got the sampler plate :).  Maybe my favorite part of this place is the sauce bar.  They have about 15 different bbq sauces you can try with pickles, onions and jalapenos on the bar too!   A solid local beer selection rounds out a really nice experience here at city bbq.  Good for families, food for couples, really good for everyone.",

Glad it was open and not too affected by the storm. The staff there were very friendly and gave us samples since it was our first time. I ordered the pull pork sandwich and my husband the sausage sandwich with two sides - greens and potato salad and chocolate cake.  My sandwich was good. I asked for coleslaw on top cause it's only way to eat a pulled pork sandwich. My husband at the time enjoyed his sandwich, his greens were terrible though. Way too much salt! I told him to tell the manager but he didn't want to we just threw the greens in the trash. The potato salad was okay and the cake was very good.  We left and went home. We live 5 minutes away. As soon as we hit the door my husband ran to bathroom and poor thing got the bubble guts. We suspect the sausage sandwich that he enjoyed didn't enjoy him and wanted out,lol.  We still liked it and will try again, just won't order the greens and the sausage any more.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I enjoyed their catering at a wedding a few months ago and was impressed with a Yelp Elite event back in December. That being said, I had a nice lunch on one of those way-too-warm-for-February Saturdays out on the patio with two adults and a toddler.   We ordered the family meal with four meats (turkey, pulled pork, sliced beef brisket and sausage), three sides (hushpuppies, cole slaw and collard greens) with two serious slices of Texas toast. With the ample pickle and sauce bar we had plenty of opportunities to enhance and compliment the already flavorful meats and most certainly had enough to fill up a to-go box at the end. I'm a particular fan of brisket and sausage, which did not disappoint, both on tenderness, juiciness and plain old chewability, but I like coming here because they have enough sauces to keep things interesting for everyone, including a nice mustard sauce and spicy tomato-based sauce.   Midwood Smokehouse's Ballantyne location is nice and a standout for Charlotte with Mac's Speed Shop, but newcomer to Charlotte City Barbeque has garnered my respect. Look forward to seeing the other three planned locations (Matthews, University area and Huntersville) succeed in the months and years ahead. Be sure to check out Rise Biscuits & Donuts next door!",

    "text": "First time I've ventured into City Barbecue while in CLT for work. I ordered the City Sampler and opted for the pulled chicken instead of turkey. The beef brisket was by far the best meat on my plate. Tender, smokey, and a handsome smoke ring surrounding a well earned bark made this the highlight of my meal. To further the beef affair, I had a small Brisket Chili Bowl and that too was a beautifully composed bite that I'd happily eat as a meal in itself. Their sausage was a home run and my second choice for meat on the plate. The hush puppies were excellent as well as both varieties of coleslaw. I didn't spend as much time enjoying the pork (a bit chewier than I liked with my recent dental work) and the chicken was tasty but not enough to distract my attention from the beef.   Their Kansas City style sauces were decent but in my opinion the real star was their Piedmont Carolina sauce. Wow! That stuff had kick and flavor and was excellent on everything from the meat, corn bread, and hush puppies.   The staff was extremely friendly in multiple interactions and made an out-of-towner feel very welcome. My new favorite Q place in Charlotte. Will definitely be back and recommend to coworkers.",

Can't honestly say yes because it's impossible to compare different styles to each other.  St Louis, Georgia, Florida, even Mountain and Costal Carolina can't be compared. Apples & Oranges.   Anyway, it's one of my two go-to barbecue restaurants in Charlotte. Best thing is that I've been to two different locations and both were excellent!",

    "text": "Full Disclosure: I am a barbecue snob and my ratings for BBQ restaurants are very critical.  5/5:  City Barbecue has the best pulled pork and beef brisket that I've eaten in the Charlotte area by an LARGE margin. Both meats were exceptionally tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The pulled pork had a little bark included. I enjoyed both immensely.    5/5:  Their collard greens were some of the very best that I've ever eaten. The pot likker in the collard greens was off the hook. There was a full serving of meat cooked in with the greens, the most that I've ever seen in a restaurant serving, and it was very much appreciated.   3.75/5:  The mac 'n cheese didn't disappoint me either.   4/5:  My piece of Texas toast was even delicious.   5/5:  My drink of choice was a tasty Arnold Palmer that I mixed at the self serve drink station.  Total Cost was $20.32. This was a little on the expensive side for lunch, but it was totally worth it. The word that kept entering my mind after every bite was \"delicious.\"  The only thing that I found missing in the food department was a smoking HOT version of their barbecue sauce. I like hotter sauces on my brisket, but they did have SIX sauces to choose from. My favorites were the \"Swine Wine\" (traditional vinegar based) and the \"Carolina Soul\" (a Lexington based sauce.)  I noticed that peach cobbler and banana pudding were their everyday desserts. Both are excellent choices for a barbecue restaurant.   DECOR:  There were two large screen tv's in the dining room, one with NFL football and one with LPGA golf. The decor was citified country, but I didn't mind. I noticed that there was a nice outside patio which would be great in the Spring and Fall. It was in the low 90's (F) today, so not so much in August.   MUSIC:  Oh yeah, before I forget, the music that was playing non-stop was fantastic Memphis blues, which I dearly love....and especially in a barbecue restaurant. The two go together hand and glove.   NEGATIVES:  All of the employees were very helpful and friendly with the exception of the young African-American girl at the register who clearly had issues with people of non-color. She was noticeably unwelcoming and standoffish. I spoke to her in a courteous and friendly manner, but she acted like it hurt her to speak to me. People with bad attitudes do not need to interact with the general public. Racism goes both ways people.  One other thing that surprised me was that their 8/16/17 sanitation rating was a surprisingly low 93.0%. The dining area looked spotless to me, although the barbecue sauce bottle lids were sticky. The most recent inspection showed FOUR critical demerits, the most surprising of which was an employee basically failing to wash their hands after handling their cell phone. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.cdpehs.com%2FNCENVPBL%2FINSPECTION%2FShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx%3FESTABLISHMENT%3D179730%26esttst_cty%3D60&s=ed5f088169bcd0d6c7f7981bd34e1e1f510337f6e37752e935a0e77c4da21651\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">public.cdpehs.com/NCENVP...</a>  FINAL THOUGHTS:  I didn't notice their pickle/condiment bar until I was getting my \"to go\" refill, but it really didn't matter because I was totally stuffed. I would definitely eat here again on my travels to Fort Mill to buy adult beverages and inexpensive petrol.",

Even the assortment of BBQ sauce left so much to be desired. I mean it isn't disgusting, it just is really far from delicious. My food with drink and a 5$ off coupon in app was about 24$",

    "text": "We were looking for a quick place to grab some ribs for my pregnant friend when we came across this place. Honestly, we chose them over others for their fried pickles but were pleasantly surprise by their huge menu.   We started with their fried pickles - which were amazing. They were crispy, lightly battered, pickle chips that came with chipotle ranch dressing. It was a very large basket that was more than enough for the 3 of us.   I asked the gentleman at the register if he preferred the pulled pork or the brisket, he recommended brisket - which was great! It came plain and we had the choice of over 10 different barbecue sauces. I also asked him which sides were best, he recommended the mac and cheese and french fries. I went with the corn bread and mac and cheese. Neither were impressive, but maybe that is because I am from Wisconsin. My friends got the ribs, chicken, french fries, vinegar coleslaw, and french fries - all were amazing!   I don't know what tipped off the staff, but they quickly realized that we weren't from around there so they insisted on giving us samples of all of their other sides (sample means about half of a side). So here is the run down... fresh french fries - amazing, mac and cheese - not great, corn pudding - my personal favorite, corn bread - again not great, gumbo - good but not my thing, sweet potato casserole - very sweet, and peach cobbler - good but very sweet.  The portions were huge, definitely share with a friend unless you want left overs. The staff was great, very attentive, friendly, and helpful. Someone even came to check on us about half way through our meal.",

The banana pudding and chocolate cake are delicious! By far my favorite desserts around. I'd bring a tub of the pudding and an entire cake home if I knew it would last longer than a night! Honestly, never disappointed and unless you know, you'd never guess it's a chain. The standards, food and service are on point. They also offer a military discount which is greatly appreciated!",

Ok, what I will say is that the main attractions, (the BBQ) have just been \"average\" in my eyes. The sausage, ribs, pulled pork, and burnt ends have been ok, but not great. The ribs were the best of all the options, but even then....... I liked the ribs better at Shane's.   The 2 best things I have had from there was the mac & cheese (add brisket or bacon) and the banana pudding. Both are great. I heard they have great fried pickles, but again, its a side dish. I want the main to be better than the sides.   City Barbeque (for me) will be a place to go to when I dont want a full complete meal, maybe an appetizer and desert.",

It is a little small on the inside but that is okay. The atmosphere is great though. The menu is not too lengthy being a barbecue place. So I ordered the chicken and sausage. I did not like how the meals did not come with any sides. So you have to pay a little extra for that. The food did not disappoint. The chicken was so moist and tender. The sausage was not spicy at all even though they said it would be a little. I also ordered the baked beans with mac and cheese and fries. The baked beans were great but the Mac and cheese was the best! The thing that made this restaurant the best to me was that they give you samples of the food. I live for samples!!!! So I tasted the regular cole slaw (good), the vinegar cole slaw (great). Then he gave me a sample of the ones I wanted but did not order. So I also had the greens (okay), green beans (better), and potato salad (good). There were also so many barbecue sauces that I could not sample them all.  Can't wait to go back. I feel like I had everything in the menu alread!",

We also ordered a rack of ribs and those were okay. They weren't the best I've ever had but I'd give them 3.5 out of 5 stars.    I ordered online to go, and I picked my sauces but then they weren't in the bag. They asked my husband and he had no clue so they just gave him 2 packs of normal sauce.  I had specifically ordered hot.  Don't have me order my sauces, then not include them automatically.  Overall, the ordering process was easy enough,and the wait time was exceptional (6 minutes).

    "text": "I have had City Barbeque in the past but at a different location and because of that great past experience I tried this locale which is closer to my house.  Unfortunately the experience was very different than the first time.  Location: The store is on a well traveled street so it is easy to access.  Parking is good and the store is a nice size so you should be able to get in and out.    Staff: The guy who waited on us was super nice and very friendly so he alone helped to raise this review from 2 stars to 3.  When we stumbled trying to decide what to order he offered us a taste to help us decide.  Based on that sample we went ahead and ordered several things that we may not have.  My daughter and I were buying food for three covering both lunch and dinner meals.  The cashier also recommended sides that we were unfamiliar with and based on his level of excitement we felt confident in selecting these items.  Food: We ordered the Beef Brisket, Burnt Ends, Corn Pudding, Macaroni and Cheese, and Fried Okra.  Although we sampled the Beef Brisket in the store and found it to be flavorful and tender, it didn't travel well.  When we got home (30 minutes later) we were disappointed to find that the meat was quite dry.  It may have something to do with how they package the to-go food as they use a brown paper which has a wax coating on one side.  That may be similar to what a butcher uses but it does not serve the food well.  The paper absorbed all of the juices from the meat and was stained with the oil/ juice while the meat lost it's luster.    The macaroni came on the recommendation of the cashier and he was right it was truly amazing.  I was pleased with the corn pudding as I had tried it in the store and it tasted the same once I arrived home.  I found myself coming back to it over and over again until it was gone.  The fried okra was nothing special as I did not taste any seasoning on it and the corn meal coating just made it too crunchy.  Other than the dry brisket, we also had the Burnt Ends.  For those who don't know, this is still part of the brisket but is cut off the end of the meat.  When I have have it at other BBQ restaurants it has been both crispy, highly seasoned and juicy at the same time.  Here at City Barbeque, that was not how the burnt ends were served.  These were large cubes of meat (too large) and they were not juicy at all but instead a bit difficult to chew.  This was surprising because it is sold as a sandwich on bread.    At the back of the counter, they have many sauces for you to use on the food so it is fun trying different ones.  You can find these sauces beside the beverages.  Location and service were great but overall, I was not a fan of this location's food.  I will still try the one in University before the final report is turned in.  Perhaps they just had an off day as we all do sometimes.",

    "text": "After so many rave reviews of this place, mine wit be a little more grounded.   I stopped here for lunch to see what City Barbecue was all about. This is not a table service bbq joint. It's BBQ fast casual. You order at the counter, give them your name, go get your drink, silverware, condiments, etc, find a seat and they call your name. You clean up after yourself.  I went with the Pick 2 option with brisket and pulled pork. I added a drink and a side of Mac n cheese. This came to $19.24. Ouch.  The waiting was minimal. Along with everything I ordered, they also gave me 3 side samples of corn casserole, green beans something I couldn't figure or what but it had rice on the bottom.   First off, the side samples were all unappetizing and looked like they were either canned or cooked too long or both. The taste was kind of meh as well. This taste continued with the Mac n cheese. The meats were tender, especially the brisket which is what they apperently shine with. The pork had no real flavor.   I tried 4 of their sauces and all I would consider thick - gravy like thick. I think it was Burnside that I liked the best but I couldn't get over the sweetness and the thickness of all of them.   I can't say I am a fan of this place. But then it's a chain, and not even based in the Carolinas. This is a chain based in Ohio. And that right there explains the blandness and the gravy like sauces.   If you want good bbq, there are plenty of locally owned places around worthy of your $$. Try Midwood Smokehouse, McCoys or Queen City Q. But come here if you want a step up from Other chains like Sonny's. I'm sure all of the above are cheaper as well.   So overall a 2 star place. The brisket was worth the 3rd star.",

I wasn't sure if it was brown rice so it'd have a bite or undercooked. Eithervway, the meats is where it's all at (food wise).   The deals is where it's at (non food wise)  Rib Tuesday isn't just 40% off your order but 40% off 1 rib and you have to order them individually versus a slab.  They give center cut and without prompting which is nice.   The brisket chili is Worth it.  This location uses a smaller cup whereas Matthews will put the chili in the bowl size (guessing here) buy it's black.   Online ordering is simple enough. Earn and redeem points via the app.   Workers we just as polite and attentive. Brisket, ribs, collard greens are what I highly recommend.",

Great atmosphere.  This was our second visit and since we had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, my wife and I splurged and both got the double meat combo (which is Fred Flintstone big.) We tried the pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken breast. All were excellent but the star here is the brisket, which had the perfect char and smoke. It'll be my go-to dish going forward here. For our sides, we chose the collards, which were cooked perfectly, a side salad, and mac and cheese.  Serving sizes were huge. Service was tops. Sanitation score was a 98. All signs of a well-managed restaurant and one that I will label a Gotta Try for sure!",

The BBQ sauce was very light on the chicken, and the chicken was really juicy,  fresh and yummy. I really liked it despite my aversion to BBQ sauce. We waited about 30 mins to eat it and it was still warm/good temp. It came with plenty of BBQ sauce on the side if you're into that and Texas toast.  The Texas toast was meh,  but I don't imagine that's what people go there for.    I look forward to going back for the brisket. I expect that will be a hit as well.",

The pulled meats are really good and the hand cut fries are divine. There is a corner in the restaurant that houses all the sauces. My favorite is the sauce with the ginger. So tangy and so tasty. I ate the salad with pulled turkey and cranberries. The dressing was an apple cider vinegarette, but I covered everything up with that ginger sauce!  Yum in the tum.  Very casual spot, just a bit too loud and frenetic for me.  I will actually probably return to the barn, mostly for that ginger stuff.",

The place is awesome for inside or outside dining and very clean inside and out. I ordered a half rack of ribs and she ordered smoked leg quarter with sides of macaroni and cheese, collard greens, Hush Puppies. Staff was efficient and professional even gave my daughter a complimentary lemonade since she had to wait on the Hush Puppies....which to me that's excellent customer service! Now to the food, if I could give this place 10 stars I would! The ribs were tender and juicy straight off the smoker and glazed just right al sides were mouth watering. The portion was enough for me to take lunch the next day and the cost was so affordable!!! My total was only $28 to feed two and have left overs. FYI, you can use Door Dash for delivery  orders. We will order from City Barbecue again!",

The food overall is really really good, with the more casual atmosphere. It's fast food-ish (ordering at a register and seating yourself) but is quality BBQ. Perfect for a busy Friday night when there are long waits at regular restaurants.",

    "text": "So I moved down from Ohio to Charlotte 5 years ago. Granted, Ohio is not a mecca for Barbeque, but North Carolina was, supposedly. I was sooooo looking forward to all the good barbecue I could find. Problem was, I couldn't find any. All the \"Legendary\" spots in Lexington and Durham and Eastern NC just didn't cut it. In fact, I would venture to say, that many of them were getting by on a name from 50 years ago. I went and bought a Big Green Egg and started making much better barbecue than I could find in a restaurant. Problem is, I couldn't get my brisket right. Then, I heard that City Barbeque, a chain yes, but also my favorite spot from when I lived in Ohio was coming 10 mins away from where I lived. Perfect! What, they have 2 in Raleigh also!!! Bonus!  I have been 3-4 times since they opened. They never disappoint. Although I have been getting the same thing here since I was visiting the ones in Ohio. Brisket, potato salad and baked beans. Typically use the Sweet City sauce, but am really digging the Piedmont Pride as well. They didn't have that one in Ohio. At least 5 years ago. Occasionally would treat myself to a banana pudding. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this meal! Thank you for coming to NC. You have now effectively upped NC's BBQ game!!!",

Their brisket and pulled pork are tasty, but their sides are really what sets them apart. Corn pudding is amazing, green beans are awesome, along with the fries, mac n cheese and fried okra. Their sauces are really good too. The brushback sauce has some good heat to it, but it's tolerable. Their rewards program is good too. Makes it easy to come back for more. Definitely worth giving it a try.",

    "text": "I'm from the \"if there's no smoke coming from the building, it's not real\" school of BBQ. Regardless, I passed by the City BBQ in Ballentyne and decided to stop in. The place was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. I got a rib plate and a couple of sides to go and was not disappointed. The rib meat was tender and fell off the bone although their sweet sauce is bit too sweet for me; I'll have to check out their other choices.  Two of their sides stand out for me; the corn pudding and the gumbo. While the corn pudding looks like it's made from leftover cornbread, it's a sweet, thick side that is very tasty. Think bread pudding but yellow with kernels of corn scattered about. The gumbo was a surprise; slightly spicy and savory and served on white rice. It's become my go to side dish. Their 1/2 chicken was just ok; it had a slight aftertaste that turned me off. I'd probably not order that again which is a shame because bbq or smoked chicken is a staple for me at other places. The brisket was very good. Brisket is one of those things that has to be served or stored in a way so that it stays moist and tender. I've taken the brisket home a couple of times and each time it was moist and delicious.....except for the last time.  If you order the brisket, take a look at it when they bring it to you. It should come in strips or big pieces. My last to go order of brisket consisted of one strip and a pile of small, crumbly pieces that came from the end or was left over. It was literally a small pile of meat kibble. Would you pay full price for a shirt that had a defect? No and City BBQ shouldn't serve scraps and charge you for it. Very disappointed about that.  That's what took it from 4 stars to 3; the people are fine but you're there for the Q. Don't serve scraps.",

We were immediately treated by a friendly, and happy, woman behind the cash register, ready to take our order.  I say this because over the past few months we have been accustomed to the opposite at many other restaurants.  We ordered pull pork sandwich with two sides and pulled chicken with two sides.  Both the pork and chicken were moist and tasty.  Sides were potato salad, slaw, salad, and hush puppies.  The slaw was especially good.  A very comfortable and friendly atmosphere, well worth our time and money.  Great job!",

There were three of us in our party and we each had to repeat our orders because she was unable to focus. We got our food pretty quickly, but just as quickly we were all extremely disappointed. Everything from the appetizer to the meats and sides were very oily or greasy and  without much flavor. We spent ~ $50 and threw out most (almost all) of our food. It was a huge waste of time and money. Word of caution- if anyone has high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.., steer clear of this place as there is a lack of healthy choices on the menu.  As it was getting late, and we hadn't eaten our dinner, we headed over to Dean and Deluca to grab a quick and healthy salad and soup. They offered quick and friendly service, and quality ingredients, as usual! If you're in the mood for bbq I would suggest trying Midwood Smokehouse as a much better alternative.",

We stopped in for an early Sunday dinner and found very few other patrons.  Our family of four tried the kids chicken tenders and mac and cheese along with dinner pulled pork and brisket.  My sides were very good, both the hush puppies and potato salad.  The bushfire BBQ sauce was just right.  If the brisket had come out warmer than room temperature, with at least a choice of lean (rather than the mostly fatty which was served), and a larger portion it would have been pretty good.  The portion seemed more like a lunch size.  My wife's pulled pork was also barely warm with an ok flavor.  Of the three who had the mac and cheese, none of them liked it.  The cheese seemed runny and again it was barely warm.  While the brisket was good enough I would consider trying it again, the barely warm food overall gives me pause.  It was nice to see jalepenos, pickles, and onions available as a self serve option.  Overall the service was good and attentive.  Given hot food it would have been a good meal for me.  As it was, we will likely stick to the two nearby competitors who provide a better all around experience to meet everyone's tastes.",
