Chicken Portofino is excellent, they have a creamy pink sauce called bosciola which comes prepared with your choice of pasta, salads are always fresh and the house dressing is to die for it's some sort of creamy italian infused with hints of basil!!  True NY style pizza prob one of the best spots in Charlotte! We have been going here for over 10 years!!! I'm a True foodie wouldn't steer ya wrong!",

The Eastway location is nostalgic for me as I went there on occasion as a youngster. The bread is fabulous - served warm with real butter. I also really like the orange colored dressing that they serve with their salads and all of the pasta dishes are great, especially the seafood selections. If you're ever in the mood for Italian in Charlotte, you should definitely give this a try.",

Still, the look in this guy's eyes this last time convinced me that though the pizza is good, I will no longer patronize this business that treats me like my presence is tolerated only for a quick & profitable transaction.",

I got penne pasta with their primavera sauce and it was so freaking good. Creamy, cheesy, perfect medley of flavors. The boyfriend got a cheesy red sauce concoction and really enjoyed it. We both had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day--win! Our server was AWESOME (wish I remembered her name, she deserves a shout-out). The pours of house wine were generous.

We had a pretty bad experience with Dolce, and had been told that good Italian is an impossibility in Charlotte.  I had a good feeling about this place when I walked in the door.  It smelled amazing, and had that perfect non pretentious atmosphere that a good Italian place should have.  I ended up ordering the Tortellini Alfredo, and my special lady friend had the Chicken Sorrento.  Both were amazing.  It made the other Italian I've had in Charlotte look like Chef Boyardee.  It was difficult, but somehow we managed to reign back and save a little room for dessert.  We had the Cannoli, and the Tiramisu.  The filling in the Cannoli almost brought a tear to my eye.  The Tiramisu was a huge portion, and was some of the best I've ever had.  All in all I plan on this place being our go to Italian, and I can't wait to go back and try their pizza!",

On more than one occasion I have created dinner out of a slice of $2 cheese pizza and a tossed salad with their House dressing, that is hands down the best dressing in town.

I also explained the back waiter never mopped up the spilled tea that was all over one side of the table.  He just took the plate and cup and never wiped up the spilled tea.  I had to go to another table to get a chair to seat my child when he returned from the restroom because his side of the table was covered with tea.  So the waitress comes back and said she couldn't take off the teas because her boss gets really upset about that kind of thing once its already rung up. So my review is low and I will not go back.

He said, \" you look like a wine drinker,\" and offered me a sample of an Italian red that wasn't on the menu.  So good, and it was only $6.00! My friend got the pasta fagoli soup, and a pasta dish featuring salmon.  I ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini minus the grilled chicken strips.  Our meals came with bread and salads, featuring some if the tastiest blue cheese dressing.  My plentiful dish was so good that I could have drunk the sauce if my manners were subpar.

I did not know that they were affiliated with the other Charlotte locations. I love how they have some of the best \"New York Style Pizza\" in Charlotte. Most places that claim they have the best have garbage in my opinion.   The service is really great as well, our server would come by every few minutes to check on us and we would chat with him for a good bit too. Dining in makes me feel I am in a Romano's to some extent. The subs are good, I generally would get the meatball one.",

    "text": "Went once for lunch. We had pizza, on a recommendation that it was the \" best pie in town \" . If it is in fact the best in town I would only make pizza at home. It was mediocre at best. Crust was just how I like it from a texture point perfect balance between chewiness and crunchy ends but it was only slightly more flavorful than a big chain fast food pizza place. The cheese was ok and the sauce was simple and unremarkable taste . The 3 toppings we ordered were mushroom , black olives and banana peppers they were eye appealing on the pie but not particularly anything special. The place was fairly busy and I will try another item off the menu another time and it better be better than the pizza . I thought the music in the restaurant as a bit odd it was a mix between the Sinatra channel and Mexican radio and was too loud for a lunchtime. I can't say that effected my review but it certainly didn't help it.",

This side of town has been trying to \"revitalize\" for years but I guess not enough gentrification has occurred. Anyhoo (yes, anyhoo), after attending an event at nearby Ovens Auditorium, our group of 5 went here for dinner. It was close to 8:30 pm upon our arrival and the restaurant closes at 10. Nevertheless, we were greeted with a smile and attended to promptly. Three of us ordered the special \"lobster ravioli\" and it was amazing! Huge portions and a yummy sweet sauce. Sorry, I didn't take a picture. Another ordered the lasagna and she really enjoyed it. Everyone took home doggie bags because the portions were so huge. Our server was great. Prompt, attentive, polite. The prices were very reasonable. Oh yeah the bread! So good! Hot and soft! Butter just melted right on it. Will definitely need to come to this side of town again. Glad that Portofinos decided to stay and support this community.",

Even with carry out the experience is pleasant, quick, and the food is still hot and fresh when you get home. A few weeks ago we actually went into the Park Road location and fell in love with it. It's a sweet ambiance with great staff and reminds me of eating in NJ/NY with my large Italian family. This is the only place I 100% love the sauce other than the kitchens of my mother, grandmother, and aunt. I am very picky about Italian food and Portofino's has my heart as the best Italian spot in Charlotte. I get the eggplant parmigiana nearly every time, my obsession, and my boyfriend always tries something new. Perfect every time, with plentiful portions so you won't leave hungry. Oh and don't forget to get a strong, tasty cocktail with dinner!",

So even though it was only 4:45 PM, I figured I would visit again.  So glad I did.  Even though it was so early, there were already a few tables filled and the carryout pizza was flying out the door.  By the time I left a little after 6:00, the place was pretty full.  I was promptly greeted and seated, and quickly attended to by my server Todd.  Great guy.  Very friendly.  His service was stellar.  I started with the appetizer special of a large Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a crab filling and topped with a balsamic reduction and served over a bed of sauteed spinach.  Delicious. I followed with a entre special of Osso Bucco (did I spell that right?) with a side of Gnocchi.  Again, simply delicious.    All in all, a terrific experience.  Great food and service, with a comfortable and quaint atmosphere.  I'll need to try harder to get over that way more often......",

The pizza alone is one of the best Italian Pie's in Charlotte...good sauce, good dough and lots of toppings.  No skimping here.  The other things worthwhile here are the lasagna and the pastas with gorganzola sauce.  Also their house salad dressing is great...a tomato based creamy Italian which also doubles as a great dipping for the hot and fresh bread delivered to your table.  Service is always spot on at this location as well.",

Then he hot a large group and he completely ignored us after this, not he was slow to come around, he didn't come back. I had to ask a bus boy to bring our check, and when the check was brought, it was brought by a different server. OK, that's not cool. This would have been a 5 star review but the lack of interest really turned my group off to the place. Especially since it was a Sunday evening when they weren't busy, except for that one big group.

I grew up in New York and just moved to Charlotte from just outside New York City....basically Italian Central!  I have ate a ton of great Italian food and am Italian myself.  When I walked into Portofino, I felt like I was back in Westchester!  Slices on the counter, garlic knots....all of the good stuff.  I have not had the pizza, but have tried a few dinners.  The stuffed shells were awesome, and included a huge portion!  The chicken Parm was great, and again huge portion.  All meals are served with a salad (delicous homemade \"house\" dressing and a full small loaf of freshly baked bread.  This place is in a somewhat sketch plaza on Eastway.....it's kinda weird that it's there, but that doesn't really matter!  It is my new \"Go to\" Italian spot when I want a taste of home.",

I can call it in on my way home from work and its always ready. I am fortunate to live a mile away from here.   If you get the chance visit this place or order take out. It is great food at a great price, and customer service is always great!",

It authentic...down to the genuine Italian guys running the joint...who will verify with you EVERY single time you call that you are calling the Eastway location.

    "text": "I had visited the Portofino's on Park Rd several years ago and wasn't wowed.  It was just okay Italian.  I also wasn't crazy about the atmosphere...or lack thereof.    So when my partner suggested we try out the Portofino's on Eastway for lunch one day, I was very skeptical.  \"The rundown plaza in the sketchy part of town where even Walmart moved out of?\" was my response.  We went for lunch and I was literally blown away.  While the location and plaza it's in is suspect, walking into Portofino's, I felt much more assured.  It offered a nice, quaint atmosphere, much better than the one on Park Rd, I think.   We were immediately greeted by several smiling staff members and the dining room was already starting to fill up with people on their lunch breaks.    Although Portofino's has a large authentic Italian menu with very reasonable prices already, we both opted for one of their equally reasonably priced lunch specials.  My partner had the mushroom ravioli with a reddish cream sauce.  I tried the sauce (I'm not a fan of fungi) and it was delicious and very flavorful.  I ordered the gnocchi special with tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic, and basil.  It, too, had a sauce that was oh-so-flavorable.  It wasn't exactly creamy, but close to it.  I absolutely loved it.    We also ordered small Caesar salads to start (for not much more) and our server brought us some delicious warm bread that we finished up by sopping up our leftover sauces.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience and our server was super-efficient and very friendly.  I have a newfound respect for Portofino's on Eastway.  I can't say I'd go there at nighttime, but during daylight hours, I'd be happy to any day of the week.",

I always get shrimp Fra Diavolo with a mix of marinara and Alfredo. First time ever (actually second, same rude waiter different location) the waiter insisted that I had to get a side of Alfredo and be charged 3.25. Ok fine. So then my salad got an extra dressing $1, croutons $1, cheese $1. When the bill came it showed 55.60. I added it up four times came to 52.60 waiter said its because they didn't have the buttons to add the dressing, cheese and croutons. So why are they charging me for it. I'll never come back here, long long time customer lost. Food was good as usual. Had this same issue with this waiter before the other waiter said don't worry it's his last day. Just to realize he only moved to another location.",

Even the bread is perfect, soft on the inside with a great crust. The sandwich is HUGE. This is still the best cheesesteak that I've eaten in the Queen City, and maybe anywhere.  Portofino's has great pasta and I love their multiple veal dishes.   Their house salad is loaded with green olives, strong on the vinegar, and definitely an acquired taste. I will admit that I have grown to love their salads, even though they're simplistic.   Professional service by waiters who are serious about their job. Every time that I've eaten here the service has been simply first class in all respects.   The desserts are beautifully made and delicious.   Linen on the tables and silverware, instead of cheapo plastic utensils.   Area code size parking.",

    "text": "This place is always amazing, the shopping center is trying to revive itself and has been trying since the chef store replaced that awful Wal-mart. Saying so, i usually just have takeout, but I always feel comfortable when I eat in too. The decor and ambiance isn't exactly upscale dining, but the food quality and presentation make a good date night spot for those looking for something \"nice, but not too nice.\" Plus it's a local small business and the guy that owns this place is legit Italian and will quickly bust your balls, which I can appreciate, but I can see if someone more sensitive might get offended.  Pizza: I like to think of myself as a pizza connoisseur and this place sets the mark.  The pizza here is thin crust with a tomato and light basil sauce that is neither too sweet nor bland topped with a quality cheese blend that is just the right amount of saltiness (which is in my opinion the most important part of the pizza equation). The sauce is on the lighter side, so if you are a sauce person you might be disappointed. I usually get a cheese or pepperoni these days, but they also have a Veggie pizza that put any other Veggie pizza you've ever had to shame. It has chunks, not bits and pieces of veggies, like broccoli and onions. If you go during lunch hours you'll be able to get the pizza by the slice, otherwise expect to enjoy an entire pie. The price is on the higher end when comparing this pizza to Papa Johns or Little Caesar's, but trust me there is NO comparison in quality. Totally worth the money. Salad: I almost always get the house salad with any order. The dressing is a unique creamy Italian that goes great with the fresh baked mini loaf of bread they give you in addition to your salad. Also they include olives in the salad which I appreciate. Olives can be so under appreciated.  Italian Dishes: So if you can't tell I'm basically in love with their pizza, but I've also tried their other food. I must say I'm not as impressed with their baked ziti or Bolognese as I have been with their pizza, but their lasagna and chicken dishes have always done it for me. Chicken piccata is probably my favorite of the chicken dishes I've had their and even have tried to replicate it in my own kitchen!   Bottom line: Eat here, you'll be glad you did.",

Huge portions ( like 2 meals worth of leftovers huge) Delicious specials  Although the pasta dishes looked fantastic, I opted for the Seafood Pescatore special. Risotto with a touch of marinara and laden with fruits from the sea - including a half filet of salmon on top.  It was divine as was the Ahi Tuna special served with a side of polenta with a creamy pepper sauce.  Delicious bread and decent wine list rounded out the dining experience. .

They have a few key servers that have worked for them for several years.  If you're lucky enough to get one of them you will have phenomenal service.  If not, you may find yourself waiting for refills and such for longer than desired.  The pizza is about what you'd expect; typical \"New York Style\" pizza but quite greasy.  The bread served at the table is AMAZING and is even better if you ask for a side of their house dressing for dipping!  Trust me on this one!  I've tried a few other menu items beyond the pizza.  Some good, some not so good.  It all depends on your taste and familiarity.  Most dishes that I didn't like were the result of me branching out to try a little something new.  All in all, it's decent Italian food.  I was a little put off during my last trip by the servers attempt to \"charge\" for a refill of the bread basket for the table.  Had never heard of such nonsense before.  Seriously?  Can I see a manager please?  That's what I thought!",

I was alone, so I did something kind of shameful...I set out to find the Olive Garden that was tucked away off of Independence Blvd. I found it, but much to my salad-craving chagrin, it was closed. Closed, gone the way of other Independence Blvd. businesses. So no unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks for me.   I started thinking of where I might find some affordable, but good Italian food, and I remembered Portofino's. It's not in the nicest shopping center ever, but the food is really good, and the prices are very reasonable. For $13 or so, I got stuffed shells, a soda, crusty bread, and a delicious, delightful salad. I was pleased.  The servers were friendly, and the service was quick. There was no line to wait, either, even on a busy Saturday night...so it's a far better option than some of the \"fancier\" Italian restaurants.

Sure, the parking lot always said \"MUG ME\", but after my dinner tonight at Portofino's on Eastway, I'll never look at this shopping center the same.  Came in around 6:30 on Saturday and this place was jumpin! Lots of couples, and a few families, we were seated immediately and started off with the Capri - buff.mozz, tomatoes, basil, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and oil/vin/spices. Everything was great, the portion was definitely big enough to split between 4 (there were only 2 of us), and the homemade bread that came out with it.... ohhhh madre, it was excellent. Everything was fresh and well seasoned.   I chose to go with the Mediterrano (w/ the pink sauce and Capelinni) due to the other reviews about it and whoa - 5 stars! Light, flavorful and multi-leveled, the pink sauce was just as good as my Nana's and I've never been able to compare her to anyone! My date went with the Scilian pizza with sausage and onions. $14.00 for the biggest pizza I have seen in recent memory. He loved it, and we've got the left overs so I'm excited to try it tomorrow (I was too busy making \"MMMM\" sounds to my pasta to try his pizza).  The grand finale left me speechless: THE CANOLI. We ordered 1 each and I swear I could have eaten 15. Filled completely through, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cocao, this canoli was a gift from the gods. I can't remember the last time I had a canoli this good was, and it makes me want to never try anywhere else's canolis because this was just the tip top of the mountain and nothing else is going to ever compare. I'm serious. I'M SERIOUS FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY - this canoli was just amazing.  Service was great, speedy and kind. Parking is easy, abeit a little rough looking. Portofino's, I love you and I love you even more since you're a few blocks from my home. If I ever sell, I will be sure to note you in my ads as a \"plus\" to homeownership around here! :)",

This location may not be in the most inviting shopping center but it is close to my home and my office and I generally pick up my food to go so really I'm not worried (besides, the police are a few doors down in the same strip mall).

That aside, I've been a long time fan of Portofino's (SouthPark, Ayrsley & Eastway locations). There are days I literally CRAVE their pasta Mediterraneo (I always order mine with capellini).  For $7, you can't beat this.  Chopped seafood (definitely has calamari in it) with mussels and all stirred up in a creamy pink sauce... this is my FAV pasta choice.  And yes, I almost always order this dish, which is soooo against my normal rule of trying new things.  Don't forget their bread, which is baked freshly... and a little tip: dip it in their house salad dressing!  OMG... it's awesome! (NOTE: if you are allergic to garlic, or don't like garlic, or don't want to smell like garlic, don't attempt this... but then why on earth are you in an italian restaurant?!)  Their other dishes are good too.  Pizza is huge, and was told to be very authentic NY style.  At my old work we used to order them for lunch, and the cheese would slide all over the place by the time I got it back to work because it's so fresh and hot (hence I'm not a pizza delivery person)  This location isn't as \"fancy\" looking, but it's close to my home.  For more romantic outings... you may want to drive a little further to the Park Road or Ayrsley location.",

This location is in a shopping center that's in a somewhat shady part of town (so I was definitely glad that we were in and out while it was still light out).  We were promptly seated and informed of the specials of the day. I had my mind set on ordering a sauvignon blanc but was told that they didn't have any so I settled for a glass of pinot grigio that very much tasted like a cheap glass of wine. I ordered the arriabbate which came with a side salad and Italian bread.  I decided to try the house salad dressing, which is tomato basil, and it was very good. Not too heavy but not too light either. The Italian bread was the True star. It was slightly warm and served with butter. Absolutely delicious and I even asked for a second bread basket #allthecarbsplease.  My main dish, the arriabbate, was just OK. I was expecting to taste more of the flavors but all I could taste were tomato and olives. The prosciutto that it's supposed to have was very inconspicuous to my taste buds. Our waiter was in training so he was very attentive to our needs.  Overall, I'd say it was good 'bang for your buck' meal and I'd be willing to try the other locations.",

We had pizza- Great!, We had pasta dishes- Great! There were salads with some of the meals and they were ample with dressing options that were very appealing. You WILL get a to-go box unless you are a glutton, the serving sizes are excellent, and the quality is good the next day when it is reheated. Good stuff! I'm not a serial 'yelper', but will ALWAYS yelp when the location deserves a FAIR report. I'm not some troll that eats out all the time, only to post some butt-hurt negative review when I \"feel\" wronged. Emotional reviews suck!

I feel like a family member when I'm picking up takeout. These guys run a serious takeout business and it seems to me that every customer is a regular.

    "text": "After a long road trip, I was interested in trying out a unique or \"buzzworthy\" local restaurant as a first-time Charlotte visitor.  When my host pulled up to Portofinos in a non-descript strip mall, I was a little disappointed.  Italian restaurants from my hometown of Indy mostly offer bland-tasting, Americanized muck, so I was immediately biased against Portofinos.   However, I was pleasantly surprised by Portofinos...decor, food, service, and all. Our table split both a bottle of dry spicy Malbec and the delicious Hot Antipasto sampler (clams, mussels, stuffed mushrooms & eggplants, and shrimp).  In an attempt to avoid a too-rich meal, I ordered the caprese salad and a cup of Italian wedding soup for dinner. While the mozzarella didn't meet my ideal (i.e. buffalo-milk-based bits of heaven), the salad was fresh-tasting and hit the spot. I also tasted my dining mates' salmon salad, baked ziti, and shrimp scampi. All were good, but the grilled salmon salad really stood out.  It came with a diverse assortment of marinated vegetables (artichokes, mushrooms, red pepper, etc) that really elevated the salad beyond just plain ole lettuce & fish.  I regret not getting to try out Portofinos' pizza, as I was repeatedly told how delicious it was.  You can watch the pizzas being made through a glass partition, which was a nice touch. Next time, no more negative Italian food bias ...and anchovy pizza, you will be mine!",

I've had the capresi salad as well when the tomatoes are in season and it is just what you'd expect.  They may also have other good stuff, but frankly I always order the white pizza with broccoli.  I do look at the desserts most trips and have had several that are excellent.  Over the years I've done their cheesecake regularly, which is a good sized slice of very respectable cheesecake with a raspberry drizzle.  I've also done their carrot cake, which I like a little less.  The frosting is less cream cheesy than I'd like.  They also often have special desserts and those are hit or miss.  Most recently had one that was two layers of a homey white cake with a lemon creme in between and it was fabulous.    Wouldn't mind if they had that one as a standard offering, although I'd probably have to buy larger pants.    We tend to take out, as it's in a sketchy shopping center and can get a significant number of beggars/loiterers over the years--east end has character:)  Shopping center may be looking up, however, as a QT has been built as a new anchor.  If you want more typical ambiance, go to the Park Rd. location, but expect a wait.  Overall, a very solid little restaurant for unpretentious Italian food and some surprisingly good desserts.",

We narrowed it down to this place and finally headed out with hungry monsters in tow.  What is up with restaurants in mall strips? It really give us pause as to whether to enter or not. Sorry. I'm not from around here so I'm still adjusting.  Well, we ventured with our ravenous pack and was seated immediately. Ordered our drinks and appetizers. Then two pan pizzas. I appreciated the quick and attentive service.  Loved the mozerally sticks. Bruschetta was missing something but decent.  As for the pan pizzas- delicious! Cheese tasted fresh. Sauce was flavorful and not overbearing. Crust was buttery and thick. Little monsters transformed into happy satisfied saints. We left full and happy.  Birthday dinner for my now adult child was a success.  Guess where we are ordering our pizzas when the Chicago Bears are playing?",

Absolutely disgusting. Oil seeped out of the bag and there was oil all over my car seat. I was so pissed.   I can't believe he sold me this food and took my money. He should have paid me to eat this crap. I threw it away. I took a bite of the garlic knot and oil filled my mouth. I literally gagged. He makes racist comments. And always seems so upset with everyone who walks in. He has a \"I'm better than you simple Americans type feel\". I don't know who you \"think\" you are but you need to take a course in customer service.   They need to shut this place down like they did the old Walmart. Same raggedy shopping center. Been going for years on and off. But I'm no longer going back ever again. But who cares right? I'm only one person. What do I matter.   I used to love their pizza but he doesn't take pride in his business or food like he used to. Not sure maybe he has become jaded/bored from the monotony of running the counter all these years or maybe his customers are just not good enough for him but whatever. Sell your business and stay your ass home then. Thanks in advance.   Btw I was complaining about my horrible experience to my cousin earlier tonight. And she said he is so racist and she stop going there after he told her to go back to Africa. Which I still can't believe. My mouth just dropped to the floor.   But after reading the other reviews, I just realized this is his normal attitude. I'm glad he didn't say that to me though lol. I would have read him to filth, then proceeded to call whistle blower 9 and then called the health dept on his ass daily, like it was my business.   Not sure if you read your reviews(highly doubt it) but if you do...Small man complex is really real! Zero out of 5 stars for you little man. If I could give you a (-5) I would.

To start the restaurant could definitely use some cleaning, including the restrooms. The severs have no personalities and make the already dark and gloomy restaurant much more depressing. Little did I know the food would be even more depressing.   Their prices aren't horrible and when you taste the food you'll understand why, they definitely aren't using quality ingredients.   I ordered a simple and basic Chicken Parmigiana which they completely butchered! The Chicken had no breading and wasn't even hot enough to melt the supposed mozzarella cheese on top of it. They're very stingy with their pasta portions as well.   The spaghetti with Italian sausage was also subpar and had no authentic flavors to it. We skipped the desserts because they didn't look very appealing spinning aground in the display carousel wrapped in saran wrap.   How this place has so many positive reviews is beyond me. But if you don't want to waste your time and money, SKIP IT!",

The customer service was also very good. I usually don't indulge in the bread and butter that comes out before the entree but omfg, their bread comes out piping hot and fresh. I ate the whole damn roll w/ the butter.  And idk about anybody else but I can tell how good an Italian restaurant is by their fried calamari and Portofino's definitely passed!",

It's a tomato based entree with plenty of garlic, sun dried tomatoes, and fresh parsley that leaves me wanting more. SO Delicious. The sauce and pasta alone are good enough that it'd make for a great vegetarian dish. I think that the chicken could stand to be soaked in seasoning at the open of business to have its own because it taste less than fresh to me. The chicken Portofino is also great, a cream based sauce with mushrooms and prosciutto. Also, wonderful and full of flavor. The service here is always nice and the dining room is full of life. While in a modest location, this restaurant is a top contender for authentic Italian in Charlotte. It has been here for years and there are a few locations around town. Nevertheless, you cannot beat the original.",

The sauce has been watery and bland with not a hint of spice.  It even looked lighter red than normal and was so thin.  I didn't even finish more than a few bites.  The time before that, I sent my food back and the waitress said \"you probably won't get a discount because the owner is cheap\"....ok, what?!  First off, I don't complain for a discount, second...if my meal sucks it sucks.  So this last time I made no mention of the depressing sauce because I didn't feel like dealing with it.  The bread was also doughy and gross....barely warm.  It was not even 1PM!!!   I might have to continue my love for Italian at one of the other locations, which sucks because they are further away.

    "text": "Between the arboretum and Eastway location, I've order at least 5 times.  I come back because you get a lot of food for the money with entrees versus some newer restaurants.  This location is pretty inside with archways, nice lighting, and greenery.  So far at this particular location, I've ordered the shrimp scampi, mozzarella sticks, lentil soup, raspberry cheesecake, chicken portofino, and cannoli.  The lentil soup is bland but they give a big serving enough to be a meal itself.  The shrimp scampi was also bland and had hoped for heavier seasoning but it was just light with lemon flavor and white wine.  The raspberry sauce on the cheesecake is amazing and the mozzarella sauce was too salty for the mozzarella sticks.  Everyone seems to like the chicken portofino.  I wasn't sure about chicken and ham as a duo but what the hey...reviewers raved about it.  The pasta was good but I think the meat and Alfredo combination upset my stomach halfway in the meal.  It lead me to believe I was lactose intolerance.  Never have I stopped in the middle of my meal to use the restroom.  Too much info but I wouldn't order this meal again.  The cannoli was definitely made fresh.  An Italian mom would be proud.",

    "text": "We typically go to Portfolios Eastway Drive several times a month. And normally service is good and food is on point.    Well today, we visited and had a EXTREMELY POOR experience and service!!! I REPEAT POOR experience and service from server (Michael).  Table #6.  We ordered small pizza, calamari, side salad, lasagna, chicken alfredo with extra broccoli and was recommended to try the lobster bisque.   So all is well or so I thought.   The calamari, salad, bread arrived to the table without any problems. Next came the lobster bisque. Which he raved that it was made fresh they had leftover lobster from yesterday and it is delicious.   It comes to the table and it's just bisque no lobster to be found. So I asked the server \"hey I have had lobster bisque before and it normally has lobster in it.\" The server Micheal says \"I don't make the soup\" and walks away. Is that how you handle loyal customers or customer's period? Let me answer NO!  Then same server comes back and says \"I spoke to the manager and what do you want me to do?\" My reply was lobster bisque normally has lobster in it.  Please remove from our bill. His responses was \"oh after you have eaten half of it you want us to remove it from your bill.\" I WAS FLOORED!!   MY RESPONSE WAS WE BOTH TOOK ONLY TWO BITES AND DON'T LIKE THE SOUP. PLEASE REMOVE IT FROM OUR BILL.   I was livid!!! What type of owner's would allow someone to speak to any customer this way. I proceeded to speak to the manager Ricky I believe his name was which was very attentive and listened while I  explained what happened. He stated the server never came to ask him anything.  SO  MICHAEL LIED!!!    Ricky apologized and stated that he would comp our meal and apologized for the  bad service. I told him that we are not freeloaders. He asked had we already paid I said no.  He stated I will take care of your dinner.  Ricky ask did I want to continue to have Michael to serve us and I replied NO!  We were sent another server Candy.  The remainder of the food came out. My chicken alfredo came out without the broccoli. Had to send server back for that.  Penne noodles are overcooked.   Now I'm really upset.   Then top it off, we were sent a bill which was suppose to be comped. With the soup taken off (which was a deduction of $2.00)  For as much money as we spend at this establishment. I find this behaviour absolutely appalling, disrespectful and downright unacceptable.  When we addressed Ricky the manager he stated he couldn't comp our food as promised. He told the owner and he would deal with the employee.  And gave us two desserts for the inconvenience.   We will not be patronizing a restaurant who doesn't appreciate nor values its customers. I will make sure that all my family and friends know about this experience.",

We were craving Italian food, but didn't want a chain restaurant vibe and found ourselves here.   The dining area was nice and seemed inviting. Similar to the more authentic Italian places in the Washington, D.C. Area (where I'm from) the servers were a bit older, which was cool. Our server and food runners were very helpful an attentive, and gave excellent entree recommendations. The dining crowd that night consisted of mostly families and it was a lively bunch.   The meal came with salad and bread. Both of which were fine. My entree (chicken Portofino) first of all was pretty huge and excellent!  I usually finish my entrees in restaurants, but I had to take it home. It was delicious that night and pretty darn delicious for lunch the next day too. The rest of our party enjoyed their meals as well.   We also found the meal to be very reasonable. Not pricey at all. So oversll, the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. I cannot wait to take my parents there when they visit. In fact, I can't wait that long, I'll be back there very soon! :)",

I told my wife for 2 years she needed to try out Portofino's and once I got her to go...she suggested we go back again within a week saying some of the best Italian food she's ever had.  I think perhaps the best eggplant parm in town.  Portofino's is really a hidden gem where every friend I've taken turns into an instant fan.  The food is every bit as good as Maggiano's over at South Park and better than the lesser competition like Carrabba's or Olive Garden.",

They have reasonably priced slices and the entrees are a bit overpriced but delicious. The chicken parm is nothing short of fantastic. I always order a large salad so I can get some of the bread and dip it in the house dressing, which is also great. They have a great variety of pizza slices available unlike many of the areas pizza places that usually only have plain and pepperoni on hand and everything else has to be made to order. Try the white pizza. They make it very well here!",

    "text": "I was a little hesitant about this place based on its location in a generally depressing part of town, however I've eaten here twice now and have been taught a lesson about judging a restaurant by its strip mall.   The owners and managers are an authentic Italian family, and it shows. I like to hear them talk from the kitchen but the noise level in the restaurant is comfortable and makes for easy conversation. I'm a sucker for pasta so the first time I went I ordered the manicotti--it was great but not too exciting (though how exciting can manicotti be, really?), but I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. The next time I had the tortellini alfredo and it was HEAVENLY--the sauce was perfectly creamy, the ham and onions fresh, and the pasta cooked perfectly. And the portion was HUGE! My partner got a large calzone and said it was also great but there was way too much of it, which is always a great complaint about a restaurant, if you ask me. Their dishes are fairly priced and possibly even a little underpriced considering the portions...bring your appetite!  The restaurant itself is small and a little dim, but seems clean enough. The service on my first visit was great, our server was very helpful and patient even though they were about a half hour from closing time. On my second visit we had a different server whom I suspect may have been new to the job, he was a little over-attendant and could never hear what we were saying, even though the restaurant was near-empty and quiet. He was nice, though, and they are very accommodating if you want to change something on the menu or have a specific request.   I would definitely recommend Portofino's to anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine, and I'm always looking forward to going back myself.  PS: Every time I visit, I feel like I'm in an episode of The Sopranos. And that is a compliment.",

Perfect, thin, great sauce gooey cheese and just enough spice to the pepperoni. Perfection in a slice. The service is always great, I always like to sit at the counter to watch them while they cook. The owner is really funny and loud and Italian. Perfect ambiance. Recently I had the pasta puttanesca for the first time, all I can say is Mmmmm. Chock full of olives, capers, chunks of garlic and tomatoes, it was sheer heaven on a plate. My penne noodles were cooked perfectly, not too mushy or hard. It was a great meal with salad and bread sticks. To be honest, I still had to take a pizza home as well, its that good.",

The waiter came out several times to refill our drinks and knew I was going to order more.  I must say that at most Italian joints, the calzones and Stromboli's are made fresh in the morning.  This does not allow for custom options.  Here I was able to order a stromboli with lots of marinara sauce without ricotta cheese. Something, I have not seen most places.",

This is the ORIGINAL location in Charlotte, and far less crowded than the Park Rd. location.  And personally, I think the food is better.    We began with an appetizer of roasted red peppers and sliced mozzarella.  There was lots of it, and it really hit the spot. All entrees come with a house salad.  I am in love with their house dressing.  It reminds me more of a creamy French meets Italian dressing.  For my entree, I ordered the the clams in a white sauce over linguine.  This is my go-to Italian dish.  It is overflowing with clam meat (or clam flesh? ew) and in a scrumptious white wine and butter sauce.  WAY too much for me to eat in one sitting.  Hello lunch for the next 2 days!  The wine prices are some of the cheapest I have ever seen.   I am fairly certain they only offer  wine and beer.  So pick your poison.  It is so good.  I will be back for sure.",

I had been asking around and could not find any good NYS pizza, but a friend recommended Portifinos so I said why not? O M G So good! Brought me back up north, all this time I was searching and had settled on Librettos as the closest to what I want but low and behold Portifinos came to save the day. Only giving 4 stars because the customer service seemed a littled forced, not genuine and slightly cold.",

I really prefer this location of Portofino's over the other locations.    For me, the food is much better here and so is the service. The first time I went here, I was picking up some pizzas to take back to the office.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of Italian-Americans whipping up some crazy good pizzas.  The smell of the place told me that I was gonna love the pizza, and I did!   So, my next visit was for a lunch meeting. We had a great waitress who kept our glasses filled and brought plenty of bread while we were waiting for our entrees.    On my first dine-in visit, I had one of their specials -  it was chicken lasagne with a white sauce.  Man, was it good!  The portion was huge, so I  had a nice second meal!    Everything I have eaten at this location has been absolutely fabulous and there is no pretentious atmosphere.",

One time I got the pizza there, it was very heavy, greasy and doughy in the middle. It was disgusting but I was starving so I choked my way through a couple of slices and later got very ill!  The next time I went was not by choice, I was meeting a large group there for lunch. The waiter obviously knew he would get automatic gratuity due to the size of our party and gave us dinner menus instead of lunch menus to beef up the bill total. He was also very sneaky about additional charges (\"would you like fries, chips or salad with that?\" -- failing to mention the fries and salad were additional charges). I requested a lunch menu and ordered the chicken parm sandwich, it was ok -- but nothing special.  I will say they have very large portions but otherwise it's not very noteworthy.",

We had 25+ people with us and the restaurant was packed (always a good sign of delicious food). The staff was very accommodating and patient.  It was a Friday and I could not eat meat because of Lent. The waiter suggested the \"Mediteraneo,\" which is mixed seafood pasta in a creamy pink sauce. There is a selection of pasta types to choose from including Cappellini, Linguini, Fettuccini, Penne, or Spaghetti Noddles. I chose penne. This was HANDS DOWN, the most amazing pasta dish I have ever had! I am so sorry if you are not a seafood fan, but I'm sure this dish could sway you. I COULD NOT STOP EATING!! The waiter consistently asked how I liked my dish (since he recommended it), which was incredibly sweet. Overall: great food, great setting and great service!  As we left, I saw that they had Tiramasu on display (my all-time favoritteeee dessert!) so I HAVE to come back and try that! The Mediteraneo dish convinced me that everything else on the menu must be just as amazing! =)",

I eventually got tired of the same pizza and I decided to research the area. I looked at a number of different Italian restaurants and pizza places before stumbling over Portofino's. I decided to give them a try and I have not had any regrets since then. The pizza is excellent. The crust is crispy on the bottom and not soggy at all. The balance between toppings, cheese, and sauce is perfect. Too much of one can disrupt the balance and you end up with soggy pizza. They have a number of other dishes that are exceptional. The manicotti alla vodka is like no other. The sauce is excellent and not too meaty. I would recommend it to anyone looking for quality Italian food and/or pizza. They offer a carryout menu, which is convenient when life is too busy for you to sit down for a meal. So far Portofino's is the best in Charlotte!",

I used to only order chicken alfredo which isn't even on the menu at Portofino's and the kitchen was always very kind to make it for me anyway. BEST ALFREDO SAUCE IN CHARLOTTE! Now I tend to order off the menu (garlic and broccoli with penne all day!!!) and eat on the leftover for at least two more meals.  I largely wanted to write this review in response to previously mentioned safety concerns for the area. I may be a bit biased because I grew up in this neighborhood and still visit it frequently, but I'm not sure where the fear comes from...I mean, this parking lot is shared with a police station...  I'm a petite female in my twenties and I have never once felt unsafe or threatened here or across the street where the Ross is and I have visited that Food Lion on more than one occasion late at night.  Please do not let your suspicions about the safety of the neighborhood keep you from this gem! I am always afraid that I will lose my favorite Italian Restaurant because they can't stay afloat on that side of town. Give them a try!! You will not be disappointed.",

Don't be disturbed by the shopping center it's located in.  It's one grungy, depressing area.  I already knew that ahead of time, so it didn't bother me.  There were a few guys behind the counter, but the bald guy with the heavy Italian accent was funny as hell.  He asked me about my day and if I had any plans for the 4th of July holiday.  I told him about my plans and he wished me well and to be safe.  I didn't really expect such a nice, warm greeting.  That's customer service!  The pizza was great too.  A perfect NY style pie.  I was just in NYC last month, so I've got street cred!  There's a reason this place has 4.5 stars.

I have been told by many a person that you can't get decent, reasonably-priced Italian food here.  However, I can't imagine that the people who told me this had ever sat foot inside this little slice of paradise.  This place is flippin' awesome!  I rarely ever order or eat marinara sauce at restaurants; however, Portofino's has some of the best marinara I've ever eaten in my life.  It is such a perfect balance of flavors paired with high quality ingredients, without the need of complicated flavors to mask low-quality ingredients.  It's not too sweet, not too salty, and has a great tomato flavor.  On the first trip, I ordered the Chicken Sorrento, which included a large chicken breast.  Not only did the food taste fresh and flavorful, the portions were definitely big enough for dinner and plenty of leftovers for the next day.  My partner ordered the Tortellini Alfredo, which was very rich and satisfying.  For dessert, we ordered the cannoli and the tiramisu.  The filling in the cannoli was very rich and sweet, yet the shell was still crisp and not soggy.  The tiramisu was magical - the best I've ever had.  The marscapone was very smooth-tasting and the coffee flavor was not overpowering.  On the second visit, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  Again, I loved the sauce, but the crust was a little too thin in places to hold up to the toppings.  I will definitely say they do NOT skimp on the toppings and cheese, which was super.  The sauce and crust were wonderful otherwise, and this is a pretty solid place to get pizza.  We also ordered the garlic knots, which were drizzled with buttery-oil mixture and garlic.  They were a little too small to adequately absorb all the flavors, but they were decent.  As for service and decor, this place is amazing.  Our waitress was so helpful and sweet to us, I just adored her.  While the plaza that houses this restaurant looks slightly (or moderately) questionable, this place is very open and nice-looking on the inside.  I loved the decor, with comfortable tables and an open look inside.    I am sad I did not try this place sooner, but now that I know it's there, I have a bad feeling I'll be going there too often.  I may possibly dream of their marinara sauce tonight.",
