The owners are so nice, the food is fast, and the price is very reasonable, especially compared to Phat or Chipotle.  I really like the fish bowl (ask for the white sauce) and the buffalo chicken bowl.  The also have a philly bowl special one day of the week (Wednesday?) and the Tuesday $5 burrito or bowl is tough to beat!",

I added a bit of the \"hot\" salsa to the top and it was awesome! To boot the price was the 'picante' on top!  Awesome value.   Picante is keeping it all really fresh tasting with a lime flavor.  They have added this to the chips as well, which was a nice touch!  Even though this is not as close to me as some of the other Mexican fast chains, I will drive there to experience their freshness again! I can confirm that none of the said Mexican chains offer a seafood option...and as a Pescatarian I really appreciate this menu item!",

The owner/manager recognized me even though I was sporting my sweaty-overworked look that afternoon.  Because of my famished and starry state of mind, I didn't analyze the menu or the diggs, I got my vegetarian bowl and dipped out.. Tisk Tisk, I know.   The vegetarian comes with guacamole so I have no price complaints. They offer brown rice, which makes them stand apart in my mind from the other Southwestern burrito chains. Everything look really fresh and well-stocked, that includes the staff... I believe my compostable to-go bowl passed through a total of six pairs hands. Honestly, 12 hands. Now that's service!  My total was $5, with a coupon which wasn't hard to come by. And yes, their interior designer also chose to go with the industrial tin-can theme, but they do have an outdoor patio with umbrellas!",

    "text": "Picante doesn't stand out from the crowd of chain Mexican-American grab-and-go spots. They are decently priced $5-7 and have a good location without much competition on West blvd.  Let me start out with the positives.... 3 tortilla options (spinach, brown, white) and they offer brown rice in addition to white, very filling (big portion), fairly healthy, and fast. The veggies here looked nicer than other chain places.  On to the dislikes... $1.60 extra to put Guacamole on your burrito ...what?! To be fair they were nice enough to put a little scoop on me for free because management saw me say noooo thank you. Also, I couldn't taste the herbs in the chicken and my rice was a bit tough (even for brown) as I was served the last scoop in the container. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't really good either. My hope is that they will put a little zing into the food to separate it from the competition.   I am a Guac-fanatic so unfortunately the extra charge will send me straight back to Salsaritas next time I want that type of lunch.",

I talked with manager to find out what they do to make their steak stand out. He said that they marinate their steak overnight and grill it with some additional herbs and spices.  Among toppings, Guac is extra but most Mex-Chains charge extra. Again, after talking to the manager, I found out that Guac is free with Veggie entries and is extra with meat entries. Compared to Chipotle, Guac is 39 cents cheaper and is fresh and delish.",

    "text": "Neighborhood place similar to Moe's or Chipotle. I find those places a little better since there are more options. For example, as a vegetarian, at Moe's in a burrito I can opt to choose tofu instead of meat and also put in mixed cooked veggies like peppers and onions. Picante does not have a tofu option. I saw a man making peppers, but it was not available when we ordered so I cannot speak to it being available. Also chips and salsa are not included, they are extra.  Now, on to the positive feedback- the burrito itself was pretty good. I ordered a vegetarian burrito with a spinach wrap, white rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, cilantro, black olives, onions and pico de gallo salsa. It was decent sized and tasty. Went on a Tuesday/yesterday, which has specialty pricing- $5 burritos and $2 tacos. Also noticed that Thursday's specialty pricing is get a free fountain drink with your burrito purchase. Not too shabby! I'm not in this area of town much, but suppose I would possibly return on a Tuesday.",

    "text": "It's been at least a year since I been on freedom drive. I live across town close to NoDa and I currently work out in mallard creek, mallard church rd area. But on this occasion I had to travel to the west side for work related reasons. I was gonna drive to south end for a quick lunch but once I turned onto morehead street I seen a big sign from Picante that said \"$2 tacos & $2 beers after 4pm\" not a hard decision to make since I was considering chipotle for lunch anyway.  Picante shares the same space as the Burger & Co. The inside has that textile mill-warehouse-to-restaurant conversion theme going, that seems to be the new trend in the Charlotte restaurant scene nowadays. They have industrial style chairs and tables a-la chipoptle style. But overall it seems to work, spacing was adequate, the place was clean and everything flowed well and the staff was very friendly. If your a fan of Moe's, chipotle or salsarita's then you know what to expect. What set it apart for me is the $2 dollar tacos and more options for protein (beef, chicken, steak, pulled pork (carnitas) & shredded beef at no extra cost if you order the tacos. I ordered two tacos, steak and fish. I had a pretty cool.conversation with the guy preparing my order, I had the same toppings on both except I had guac on the steak and a spicy aioli that he recommened on the fish. I'm not much of a fan of mayonnaise based sauces simply because most of them have too much mayo and very little of anything else, but he said it was great so I tried it, and it was a great compliment to the fish. The steak and fish were very well seasoned, put them in a bowl by themselves and they could hold up on thier own, they compliment, not dependent on all the other toppings for flavor. The staffmember prepping my food was not cheap on the meat either, both my tacos were overstuffed, everything was fresh. I was very satisfied after my meal. Two tacos & a beer filled me up like one $6 burrito, with a little bit of change left over. My visit to Picante's was great and I will be going back to the west side more often for more $2 tacos. For a long time, the only type of food you would find on freedom and the West side of Charlotte is fast food and southern style fried foods. Freedom drive had the reputation of being an area that was dangerous to be in after dark. So I'm glad to see that the current renaissance that is sweeping through Charlotte has not passed over the West side. The rejuvination process has been slow compared to other areas, but there has been progress. The city has taken an interest in revitalizing the freedom area (probably because its right down the street from.panther stadium and practice field) and now the street has new pavement, old historic homes have been renovated, abandoned warehouses and mills have been torn down and replaced with upscale condos and apartments or renovated for retail space and businesses have been moving into the area in droves. The law school is even located just down the road on Wilkinson Blvd. The west side will alway be a black community at its heart, that seems to have carried a lot of negative connotations over the past few decades.  But when the city took interest, so did business and it welcomed a new group of professionals and diverse people to redicover the goodness and potential in the area, slowly erasing the bad stigma that has plagued this side of town for years and restoring pride back into Charlotte's historic black community. Anyway, didn't mean to get all deep and PBS on everybody, just wanted to express that. Go try Picante if your close by sometime, it's another great place for lunch.",

    "text": "Picante just opened this week and it's a welcome addition to the Westside. When the craving for a burrito hits uptown residents no longer have to haul over to Southend or Dilworth.  The menu is basic with burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and salads your main options. El ninos get the option of quesadillas so chalk another advantage to being wee besides not having to file taxes.  Ordering is like you're used to, pick your form, protein and toppings. Is this place better than Phat Burrito? No, but it just opened and there are some flourishes here to distinguish itself. Spinach is one of the tortilla choices, the rice is seasoned similar to Qdoba's but with more subtlety, carnitas is one of the proteins and there are 2 seasonings to choose from for chicken. Another bonus: the availability of Mexican Coke! No Lindsay Lohan, I mean the made-with-real-sugar hecho-en-mexico 12 ounce bottles.  Grab your coke or bottled beer and grab a spot on the patio, I'm sure it'll be popular with a great view of uptown including Panthers Stadium. Parking is around the corner & shared with The Burger Co. There's bike lanes on 3rd St (cut through Wesley Heights to get here) or Morehead and covered bicycle racks in the parking lot too, so how about saving the planet when you get your munch on?  Hours are lunch to late dinner so consider a stop if it's Tuesday and you're still scared from your last stop into a Moe's on Kids Eat Free Day.",

Also, I question whether the food on the burrito bar was hot enough.  I feel better when I see a little steam rising but there was none. Lukewarm meat = germ factory.

The portions and options are almost identical and it's great knowing you are supporting local business.  Here's the break down:   A toasted tortilla at the bottom of your burrito bowl at Picante will set you back an extra 50 cents. Chipotle will not. -1  Picante offers more chicken flavor selections (herb and buffalo). +1  Chipotle's guacamole is chunkier and more flavorful. +1  Picante has $5.00 burritos or burrito bowls on Tuesdays. Tip: Go during off hours to avoid lines. +50  I'm summary, so what? I save the money and carbs for not adding guacamole and a tortilla to my order and don't have to take the trek down south blvd to the nearest Chipotle.  Bravo, Picante!",

After a while, my classmates and I would explore more and venture into Southend or Dilworth if time permitted.   But we were really happy when Picante opened up since it's still near campus and it's a change of pace from your burger/diner style joints.   How's the food?   It's pretty good. If you are a fan of Chipotle, Qdoba and Moe's, then you'll probably like Picante. The chicken, steak, shredded beef, and fish are really good. They occasionally introduce specials and new items to the menu too (buffalo chicken or philly cheesesteak burritos). They have drink specials and even do punch cards for free burritos.  The owner and his wife are super friendly, as well as the rest of the staff. The price is pretty much on par with the competitors, if not a little lower.   I'll definitely be making my way to picante in between classes soon!",

I think you are supposed to park at The Burger Company.  I'd give it 5 starts except for the chicken, I think they should just drop the additional flavor. Will be back for sure!",

My favorite time to go is during the lunch hour when the food is freshest. The food can be a little old if you go during during time.   Service: 2/5 I love going when the owners are there as they are extremely nice to the customers and have the place running like a well oiled machine. During dinner it is a different story. My most recent visit (7/29) makes want to take a long a break from giving this place any business. The two women working could not have been more annoyed to be there. I ordered a chicken bowl, as it was the special. The woman making my bowl could not have been less enthused to be helping me and hardly uttered an audible word while I told her what to put on my bowl. I can get passed the slight attitude when the job is done right, but it wasn't. She rang me up and did not discount the meal for the  special. I asked her about it her attitude turned up a notch. She reimbursed me with cash after I paid with a card.  She handed me the cash silently with a puss on her face.  She didn't say a word, and I wasn't sure what to do with the money. I started putting it in my wallet and hen she asked me to repay her for the bowl at the discounted price. After this was taken care of we realized there were no straws for the drinks. Asking her to restock those was a travesty. She slunked from behind the counter to pull out more straws from under the counter and restocked them.  So much attitude just to fulfill her responsibilities of her job.   I cannot recommend anyone enter this place unless it's during lunch when the owners are around. Puts a very sour taste in my mouth when a customer is treated poorly, especially when it is brought on by the laziness and inattention to job duties by the employee.",

Tons of meat options here: beef, chicken, steak, veggie ad even fish!   I got the special which was the Philly Cheesesteak...WHAT?!? Yes please! It came loaded with queso and steak over rice (white or brown) and I added lettuce, cheese, corn salsa, and sour cream (no extra charge for sour cream here!) And bonus alert....on Thursdays you get a drink for free! Whoo Hooo!   The bowl was absolutely delicious! Very tender steak...loved the queso and just the creative combination of flavors. It was all very fresh and tasty! Add chips for $1 and you have a great meal. It's definitely worth a visit!",

I specifically asked for each sauce (guac, queso, salsas) to be served on the side ONLY. However, every single sauce was in the burrito bowl mixed together. Almost inedible for me. So disappointed.",

I just do the $5 burrito Tuesdays which are a more than adequate excuse for not cooking that night.  Ingredients are just as good as the other more well known Mexican places.  And I'm happy they don't give out chips with the burrito because I don't need that extra carbs and sodium anyway.  And it's right off Route 77.  Definitely worth checking out this area if you've never been which feels like a mini NODA.",

So if you're feeling like supporting a local place and feel like eating a burrito or taco that you could've gotten at chipotle this is your place. The vegetarian option currently is only sauteed vegetables but otherwise a decent place.",

The menu that hangs over the counter is almost identical. You pick your food item of choice (burrito, bowl, tacos etc) then load it up with rice, beans, protein, Etc, etc.    Each time I've come here, I've gotten a burrito and have loaded the thing up until I need a fork lift to carry it out the door. Which is why I'm probably miserable at work afterwards lol...  I love Chipotle ... I really do. But every time I go there for lunch I somehow end up spending $15 somehow....one of my favorite things about Picante, aside from them switching up their protein options is the fact that they offer $5 burritos or bowls on Tuesday, which is a GREAT deal.   This is def a good spot if your looking to switch up your lunch options every now and then. Between their $5 burrito deals and them being .5 miles from my office -- I'm certain I will be back.",

I moved down the line picking items for my salad. Paid. The end. No smiles, no interaction, just stares to imply the question of toppings I wanted.  Drink selection was very limited. I was going to get water but it's connected to fruit punch. The person that was ahead of me got water and it was pink from the fruit punch. None for me.   I may go back to try something else. Flavors were mild and something made my salad very watery. Not appealing at all. I like they had fish as an option, but its not better than something I would have bought a Chipolte.",

First off it was easy to get to which is always a plus for me being that I'm still fairly new to the city. There was plenty of parking which I also LOVE! The restaurant is pretty large. Even though there were a lot of people we still had no problem finding a seat. I would say the set up is very similar to chipotle. Pick your item of choice (burrito, burrito bowl or nachos) and then you pick your toppings. I opted for the chicken burrito bowl. They also accommodated my son who just wanted rice and beans . The food was great. I finished it all in one setting. Perfect portions of everything that made a very satisfying meal. They also had a lunch special going on for the burritos and burrito bowls. I believe they were $5.50 that day which was nice because usually something like that will cost $8-$10 easily! Overall great atmosphere, great staff and a nice place to have something a little different. I'll be back...",

That's right, no freezer in the kitchen.   I hate to even have to use the C word here, but this is similar to a Chipotle. It's fast casual Mexican. However, this is a locally owned and operated restaurant by a husband and wife team. Not a chain. And it's delicious.   You can score lunch here for less than ten bucks. Tacos, burritos, bowls, salads and lot of different protein options. On Tuesdays, they do all their burritos and burrito bowls for just $5. I always get a burrito bowl when I come here. Tacos are $2 after 4pm every day. All of their salsa and beans are made from scratch with fresh ingredients. I like that there's also a brown rice option. They slow cook the pork and shredded beef for six hours, grind the top round for the ground beef dishes. A ton of work goes into all their food. For the colder months, they just started doing a chicken tortilla soup.   And as we've all learned in life, guac is always extra.",

Its impossible to finish an entire burrito because they are so huge. Maaaaaaaaan, I like it.   I went home that night and told my boyfriend that I think it's better than chipotle. He gave me the \"whhhhaaaaat?!\" face, but I stand by my claim. We recently went back together and it confirmed my assertion.

They gave us a whole break down of the options, very cool. I ended up going with the fish burrito while the bf went with the chicken. Wow, I was blown away by the fresh ingredients and the flavorful sauces. My fish burrito was delicious, not too fishy ( the tilapia was seasoned with cumin I think) and that chipotle yum yum sauce is super bomb. Not to mention, the burrito was huge!

The portion servicing is huuuuge, quite generous and the quality of ingredients is a step up from Chipotle too. I can usually get about two meals per order. I usually go for the Buffalo Tofu which they make fresh upon order. Oh and make sure to get an order of their house special white sauce too! I'm not sure what it is but it reminds me of the sauce from The Halal Brothers in NYC!",

They have a special on Tuesdays where you can get a burrito or burrito bowl for like $6.22 with tax. The servings sizes are HUGE and I could easily get 3 meals out of one bowl.   The ingredients taste a lot more fresh than Chipotle and I would honestly take Picante over Chipotle any day. They don't skimp on the protein, and everything tastes great.   I have a feeling this will be my new Tuesday spot for sure.",

I'm able to eat on the bowl for at least two days. The food is delicious and unfortunately I can't make it over to the restaurant until closing time because of grad school, but I still have a quality meal. This is a real gem.   So far I have only tried the buffalo chicken. The portions are huge. Their salsa is HOTTTTTTT like grab some milk hot. Please be careful. I personally can handle it somewhat but it threw me off considering I get \"hot\" at Chipotle as well. This is definitely much more spicy.",

    "text": "Not sure where to post this review since the Picante Express is just a pop up shop for the summer. But I super excited they are in uptown.   Picante Express will be beside the Welcome to Charlotte Information Center all summer. My friend was raving about their burritos and that the days prior they had ran out of burritos. She stated that herb chicken was the first to go and that we had to be in line right when they opened.   We got to the area beside the welcome center and were informed that they had only 150 burritos for that day. I was able to quickly place and order and get my burritos bagged up. I requested the chipotle sauce on the side also.   I would have to say I didn't eat my burrito until about an hour to hour and half later and it was still good. The sauce was a great compliment. It definitely has that smokey chipotle taste to it. The burrito was filling and worth the $5.   Picante Express  May 6, 2019 11:30pm",

    "text": "\"I'd like a burrito that's better than Chipotle.\", I replied when I was asked, \"What would you like sir?\" from the burrito specialist. She loved my response and put forth a great amount of extra effort into making me this epic burrito. She mentioned, because it's my first time at Picante, this is a special burrito that doesn't get made like this every single time. That immediately screamed to me - request same lady to create my burrito every visit. Find out her schedule, get her name, and call ahead to see if she's on shift. It's worth it. Pro-tip: Be kind to your burrito specialist. They are the ones in full control of what you will indulge on. Doesn't have to be over the top, some simple small talk will suffice. Don't be shy to flare a little personality and be friendly to spice (no pun) up their day. Remember, they are wrapping burrito after burrito all day long which can get monotonous. This burrito was so Big Time, just look at the size of this baby. It's about the size of my lumbar pillow I take on airplanes/long car rides. While holding it wrapped in the warm tin foil, this thing carried some serious weight to it all crammed with these delicious ingredients: herb chicken, black beans, brown rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, green salsa, olives, guacamole, corn, shredded cheese, and queso sauce. So much flavor. This was not an easy burrito to wrap. Picante carries a heavy spoon, hooking it up with their protein portions. This is where they clearly separate themselves from Chipotle. The gentlemen in line ahead of me got the same treatment from another employee, so it wasn't just me. Being a big time burrito guy, I will rate this a solid 8.5/10. Go on Tuesday's as their special is $5.50 for any burrito or bowl. As the saying goes, \"Ask and you shall receive\". I no doubtly got what I asked for - a burrito better than Chipotle.",

I explained its just the meat for the taco so it wouldn't get soggy and she didn't care.  I said that's sad cuz from now on I will just go somewhere else, and she really didn't care at all and even shrugged and said \"ok\".

    "text": "Consider me a gigante fan of Picante! Surprisingly, I'd never heard of this place until I saw a recnt post on Charlotte Agenda's IG. I then decided to check out the Picante website and saw they have regular specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Tuesdays: any burrito/burrito bowl for $5.75 Thursdays: any burrito/burrito bowl with a drink for $7.29 ($7.46 after tax)  I came in on a Thursday afternoon (Valentine's to be exact) and it was pretty quiet. Picante doesn't have its own designated parking lot as it's right in the same center/strip as Rhino Market so I parked in the large Rhino lot. When you walk in, the menu is large print right above the counter and there are plenty of tables inside as well as a few outside in front.  I went with a buffalo chicken burrito bowl and, just like Chipotle/Moe's/Qdoba/etc, I was able to go down the line and pick out my desired toppings. I will note that what makes Picante stand out, other than the Tues & Thurs specials, is that they offer a wide variety of proteins: two types of chicken, beef, two types of tofu, steak, and even fish. As for the beverages, they have a standard fountain machine, sweet tea, and an agua fresca dispenser. I didn't get fresca but I will on my next visit! There's also a station of various bottles of hot sauce: valentina (my personal favorite), cholula, green pepper, etc.  I grabbed a seat inside and dove into my bowl. I found the bowl portion to be HUGE. Like, two or three different meals can be had from this one bowl. I found it all to be delicious. No complaints here.  I was able to get in and out with plenty of time during my lunch hour so it's definitely now part of my regular lunch rotation. I highly recommend Picante!",

We consider ourselves regulars and we were totally surprised because we have engaged pleasantries with all of the servers, including this one.   My wife ordered a single taco as I was observing. She decided she wanted two tacos and she mentioned it to the young lady and I witnessed this girls eyes roll so far back in her head, I thought she was either suffering a seizure or decided to take a look at her own brain!!! My wife didn't notice, so I asked her if my wife said something that warranted such a nasty eye roll? Immediately she responded she was having a bad day and apologized. My reply was, I'm leaving and I refuse to eat here and she profusely apologized to my wife and the back of my head as I walked out. There she stood with a taco in her hand looking really silly and embarrassed. She also had a NEW ATTITUDE.   I would say 3 stars because the food is normally good and the service depends on who's there. This experience ruined it so I deducted a star.   The same money we didn't spend at Picante, was welcomed with warmth and smiles as usual at ROCO on Central Ave, another one of our go to spots.",

But I'm very happy i have it another chance. The food is great and fresh! As a nacho expert, this place definitely has some of the best in town.  Now i been here a couple times and enjoyed their buffalo chicken nachos, but i have to talk about the most recent.  I went in on a Friday afternoon, the place was empty and we were waiting on one of the employees to finish making a uber eats order( good to know they do that here!) Another employee comes up to help, never got his name but he was an older guy, or at least older than any of the other employees.  Let me tell you,he made the most beautiful nachos ever!!! Now with a line and if i was in a hurry his slowness might of bothered me, but i think he knew he could take his time and put all the love in my food. It was like he was creating a piece of art with each ingredient he was adding on. At first i looked at my husband like-is he seriously going to go this slow with each ingredient?!?! But that quickly turned into me noticing how much detail he is putting into making sure everything is evenly coated and placed properly. You know your so used to places going as quick as possible down the assembly line and just quickly plopping your ingredients on, you never notice how great it is to see them put love in your food. He was making perfect zig zags with all the sauces as if he was doing a plate presentation. Y'all he was like salt bae as he gently coated my nachos with cilantro.Cilantro bae?  It was entertaining to watch and i wish it would of been on a regular plate and not an enclosed box so i can get a proper picture.  And yes, it was a good as it looked. I usually avoid queso and just get shredded cheese but decided to switch it up and glad i did.....don't skip the queso! My husband got fish tacos, which he said were good but the fish was extra fishy. Which i guess could just mean extra fresh?!? Like the fish smell was not trying to escape his hands after washing them.  They sell king of pops here which is always great and always have a clean dining room. This place is perfect if it wasn't for the lack of adequate parking. You have to park on the rhino market/burger company lot which is usually packed and still requires you to walk a little; or you can find street parking.....but still a little walk. It was raining so i was not excited about the parking especially on that day. Anyways, try this place out and prepare to be presently surprised!",

    "text": "If you're on the west side of town looking for quick Mexican fare (that's local!), you've found your place. Affordable, fresh, and filling - yes please.  Choose from a variety of meals (burritos, tacos, burrito-bowls, etc.), and walk down the line picking and choosing what the friendly Picante staff member adds to your dish. Top it off with chips and guac or salsa and a soft drink, and you're all set.   This place is steps away from where I live, adding even more appeal for the hubby and I to occasionally make our way down to Picante for lunch or dinner. I will say I've been disappointed with flavor in the past (the regular chicken, for example, is nothing to write home about), but you'll get over it when you add all of the tasty additions on top. Shout out to fresh cilantro for always being there for me and my taco bowl.",

Though, I don't expect this to last long as it was more of he was looking for repeat customers.  Otherwsie I would give this 4 stars.",

The burritos are usually huge, although you occassionally get someone who makes them a little smaller.  Same for the burrito bowls.  They also have $2 tacos after 4, which is a good deal.",

    "text": "Hiding next to the Burger Company is a little place called Picante.  We ventured in one day to check it out and have been back three times since.  Obviously we like it because we've been back.  Simple menu with solid choices and good quality food.  For the most bang for your buck go with the three soft tacos and load them up with all the fixings.  They have chicken, fish, steak and ground beef and lots of veggies.  The Guacamole is good but an order of chips and a coke will put you over $10 so a took a star off for being a tad pricey.  They should have a deal where you can get chips and a drink for around $7.99 with your tacos.  One point, they have $2.00 Sam Adams bottles seemingly everyday and also on the weekends they have $1 tacos.  Great little place.",

Imagine my disappointment when I walked into this joint that looked like a copycat of Chipolte and wished that my chicken burrito was Chipolte. Everything about my meal was bland and flavorless. Ironically, Picante has no spice. I guess it's back to burgers and Italian.",
