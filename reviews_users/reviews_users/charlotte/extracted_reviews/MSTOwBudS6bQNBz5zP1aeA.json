    "text": "We made a second visit. I was very happy (I just want you to WIN!!) because the food is very GOOD! I had the jerk chicken entree, with a side of rice and beans and plantains which I don't believe were fresh, more of the frozen type. (I could be wrong) but were still good. My food was not hot at all. I was so hungry that I didn't bother sending it back. I will say, my companions weren't wowed at all! Service was slow and we waited quite a long time for chips and salsa and even longer for our drinks, which came after the food. There's no such thing as food to-go here either. I left still hungry :(  Something to keep in mind: you have VERY strong competition within close proximity. You can get superb quality, fresh, HOT and nicely portioned meals all day within feet of this restaurant. Rice is fairly inexpensive and I myself, am completely puzzled by the amount that is served, especially if it counts as a side. I also heard another table mentioning that the drinks were subpar compared to another establishment. Please read your reviews and make what adjustments you can. The place was full and lively so that's a good thing. You are such a welcomed addition to this area. I will continue supporting hoping to see further improvements as you grow.",

We visited on a busy Saturday night but had a great experience thanks to the excellent customer service from Adrian, an amazing manager who apparently doubles as a waiter and bartender and anything else that is required to make customers happy. Have been to many places during peak hours and very few can handle the pressure like Adrian while keeling a smile on their face.",

There was a significant wait, and their bar was full, so we added our names to the             list and decided to go to one of the other bars to wait it out. Mango's  was the first place we passed. Went in and was pleasantly surprised by the menu. My husband is from Trinidad, so to stumble upon a Caribbean restaurant, with such amazing cuisine, was a True find. We loved the Baba Ganoush. My husband had the chicken curry and loved it. I had curried chickpea and veggies, which worked beautifully with my Vegan diet. Service was spot on. We were seated immediately. Love NODA,and this restaurant fits well with the entire scene.",

    "text": "Went to celebrate great news with friends on a Saturday night. I needed to make a last minute reservation because my first option fell through, and they were accommodating. My party arrived and the waitress could not have been nicer to us. We explained that two people would not be with us and we went ahead and ordered. After this, the bartender walks over and makes a comment about the rest of the party not being present. My order came with the wrong sides, which was corrected. The food was not good \"Caribbean\" -- the oxtails were overcooked and tough. I ordered a drink with dinner... never got it, but was okay without it. When the waitress brought my bill, she said \"did you ever get your drink?\" I said no...and instead of correcting my bill, she brings me a drink and tells me that he said he made it an hour ago...but that that was not True. So, as we are wrapping up...I'm being made to pay for a $10 drink that I ordered before dinner. As friends and I are finishing our drinks, the bartender comes over and asks if we are staying for drinks. When we respond that we would, he said that we could come to the bar because they have a \"10-top and needed the tables\" we were sitting at.  After this happened, the waitress came over and expressed that that was completely rude and that she had already spoken to the owner. We, however, did not receive any sort of apology.  Food wasn't great, but we were looking for a nice place to have dinner and celebrate good news. The food wasn't that great, and the treatment that we received was even worse.",

Our group was promptly seated and offered menus. We selected drinks, including red and white Sangria on special ($5) and cocktails (~$10). The drinks were good, but a little on the sweet side. We also got chips and salsa, and the chips were fresh and crisp and served in a cute cigar box.   We then ordered entrees including jerk chicken tacos, jerk chicken nachos, chicken empanadas and curry goat. The main reason for the non-five star review was the fact that the food came out at all different times.   The food itself was very flavorful, with the a little bit of heat. Portion sizes were decent for the price, though not large enough for leftovers (I wish! The goat had great flavor and was tender). The only issue was there were quite a bit of bone pieces mixed in with the meat.   The best part of the meal was the service! Our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating, despite the challenges some of our party threw her way.  We'd definitely be going back soon. Hope word spreads about this place!",

I asked about this, and the waitress only brought out the plantains. Perhaps there is some confusion if the dish actually comes with two sides or not?   Service was mediocre. We had to ask for waters three times. Also, we got the empanadas after we got our meals even though that was the first thing we ordered.  I'll go back, but I'll give them a couple weeks to sort out the kinks.",

I've never been to a restaurant where I only got 4 oxtails, they were good, but I only got FOUR! My partner got the curry goat in the picture it was tasty too, but not as spicy as I would expect curry goat to be... The sides were kinda bland, idk, I would look at this as one of those \"Caribbean fusion\" restaurants. But overall, it was fine if you don't care about portions! Also if you never really had real Caribbean food, this could be the place for you!",

The menu is very limited.  We ordered chips and salsa to start. They brought out a black bean and corn salsa which I've had at other places and is usually great but not the case here. The salsa is flavorless and the chips are stale with a very off putting aftertaste. After tasting, we did not eat it.   For dinner I had the roasted chicken with beans and rice and plantains. Since I ordered white meat I was expecting a wing and chicken breast, but instead got a chicken wing and the rib cage of a chicken. I mentioned this to our server and they were very nice and brought me a new piece of chicken in a few minutes. The rice was overly aromatic so all I could taste was the herbs and could not actually taste the rice and beans. I will give them credit, the plantains were perfect. My boyfriend got chicken fingers and fries from the kids menu which was your run of the mill frozen chicken fingers and fries you can get at a store. My friend ordered the jerk chicken which she said was ok.   Considering the reviews I expected way more and will say was incredibly disappointed. I will not be returning here. With there being so many great options in the area I can't see how this would ever be someone's first choice.",

My two friends ordered drinks and it took forever for them to come to b the table. We got our food before they got their drinks and they ordered those first. I'm also not quite sure if the cooks and chef are paying attention to the orders. My friend ordered curry chicken with green beans and peas and rice. My other friend ordered jerk chicken with green beans and yellow rice. When the plates came, they had mixed vegetables Instead of the green beans. Now the server came out and told my friend they were out of rice and peas but she never came and said they were out of green beans until our plates were on the table. What if someone was allergic to the mixed veggies that the chef put on the plate instead of asking for a substitute. I ordered 2 chicken empanadas, plantains and yellow rice. The empanadas were great. I had a snafu, one of my chicken empanadas was actually vegetable so I sent it back and they corrected it. The plantains were good and the yellow rice didn't have any flavor. It needed seasoning. I added the mixed veggies to it and it made the rice 10x better. The french fries are good. Theyre cooked in garlic. Overall, the food is great but the service is slow so beware.",

Not to say that it's easy but their style is all pretty much pre made. Nicely roasted chicken, rice, etc. So it should be pretty easy to keep it all smooth right? Well not in the slightest apparently. We were quickly seated, handed menus and offered drinks. Fifteen minutes later the bartender noticed nobody had brought them to us so he did himself. And took our order after noticing nobody had done so. Food came out and that was the last we heard from anyone there. I stopped a waitress and asked for a second drink. Never got it. Our plates sat empty for a good half hour as staff busily wandered with nothing in hand. We had to beg to get a check and then beg even more to pay it. I hope they get it together.

I guess there's something about catching this spot at the right time; it feels like you've walked into a legit Jamaican/Caribbean restaurant.   This last visit we ate a little, drink a little more than we ate, and chatted it up with the Chef Frankie and others. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. We ordered the jerk wings...delicious. Apparently, they make their jerk in house; the scotch bonnet comes through nicely.   Now for what we came for...the drinks. Ryan, the bartender, sure knows how to mix a drink. We ordered a couple of drinks off the menu; they were good. Then Ryan created a drink on the fly based on my boo telling him he liked tequila. I called it the Spider-Man, because Ryan climbed up the bar to pull down a couple of bottles and it was amazing.  We plan to come back for brunch. They have jerk chicken and waffles as a brunch offering. Looking forward to checking it out.",

    "text": "It's a no from me. My friend came into town and had heard good things about Mangos. So we went mid day on a Saturday. I had the Island chicken with green beans and French fries. I read somewhere that the fries were cooking in a garlic oil. They were not. There was a tiny smidge of a garlic and herb sauce that was on the fries (See photo). The beans were decent. The chicken was cut up in random pieces, dry, and bland. Fries were basic without sauce. Green beans were good. There's a mustard sauce for the chicken. It wasn't good.  My friend had curry goat, rice, and green beans. She thought her goat was a little chewy, but had decent flavor. Their cocktails were good.  Things went left with the tacos. First, the taco appetizer was $11.25. It came with three tacos and I couldn't help but think how I could go to Cabo Fish Taco and get an entire meal for the same price. The pictures on Yelp showed 3 tacos. The waitress said there would be 3 tacos. They come out and there are 2 tacos. Of course I point out the obvious and she says that it's the kitchen's choice. ????!??!?! So I asked to speak to management. He comes out and says that there are two because he was delivered larger tortillas and so there's more on each taco. The pictures looked the same size as on Yelp and the waitress just said there would be three. If there was a change of plans for today, she should have known. I told him I felt like we were being jipped. He finally conceded (almost as if it's not worth arguing) and sent out a 3rd taco. He wasn't rude about it, but didn't seem to understand that consistency and managing expectations in a restaurant is a big deal. The tacos were okay. Needless to say, I won't be back.",

I got a mixed drink that tasted like watered down melon liquor and my friend got a \"Margarita\" that was just sour mix and ice cubes. We asked to Switch our drinks out for beers, the bartender informed us that we could have a beer but would still be charged for the mixed drinks that we didn't drink!! We were shocked. They pointed out that it was literally printed  on the menu that there is \"no refunds for mix drinks\". Ummm what?! hello?! isn't this a sign that your bartenders are absolute garage if that many people have returned them & that's written on the menu?!?!!! My husband ordered a Unsweetened iced tea and of course got a sweetened one with a  comment \"we don't even carry tea normally, todays your lucky day\".... uhhh what? So they took off the $1.75 tea, leaving us with a $20 tab for 2 horrible drinks & lousy lousy service. Don't waste your time or money.",

The quality and quantity of the food is not worth it! I got chicken and waffles in which I was supposed to get a leg and thigh. I received chopped up chicken bits, mainly bones and half a waffle. Wtf?!? For $12, I should've received a whole waffle and chicken. The food is not authentic. My friend ordered a $5 drink. The waitress said we don't have small glasses so we have to charge you for a large which is $10. What?! That's not our problem. Also, they added gratuity for a party of 3.

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.  We had two cocktails and a serving of empanadas.  The drinks were fine and we really enjoyed the empanadas.  A 5*.  We visited again yesterday evening.  It seemed that our server had just been hired off the street.  We ordered a beer and a sangria, (no thing fancy here). 10 minutes later he finally brought them to the table (there was practically no one in the restaurant).  He asked if we had decided what we wanted to order.  We told him we never got a menu.  So he apologetically offered the menus from his pocket.  We ordered another two more beers.  After a few more minutes the server returned told us they had no more of the beerwe requested, and evidently their draft system was down. (?)    We ordered the chicken curry and the jerk pork with sides.  The chicken curry was very tasty, but the pork was not tender and was very fatty.  We ordered sides of the rice and beans, fruit and plantains.  Portions were generous. I don't think this place will make it with such poor service with all the other very fine restaurants around.",

She was great.  3rd- drinks - so in my opinion this is going to be a great summer menu, I tried something called beat the heat I think - perfect for August weather on Theo back porch (which I took a peak at while there). Good selection, mostly rum drinks (that's to be expected but they had a full bar. 4th - Food - so just FYI the smell met us on the sidewalk and pulled us in. They have traditional Caribbean food - jerk chicken and pork, beans and rice, plantains, again expected - they also did a jerk chicken nacho. We got the empanadas ( 3 types) all were delicious! We also got the jerk wings - ended up ordering two orders - fall off the bone GOODNESS!!  I will def be going back.

We shared because our friends said it was plenty to share, I beg to differ. I thought the portions were pretty small for this type of fare. But, the prices were very fair.

It took close to 20 minutes for our waiter to even come to the table. This was after initially waiting 30 minutes to be seated. He never offered us water. It took over an hour for our food to come. It was clear that our waiter, Cody, had some personal problems going on. I spoke to the promoter who tried his best to help with the situation. Things worsened when he finally gave us our checks and took over 30 minutes to scan our cards. I asked the promoter to speak to the manager who insinuated that it wasn't the best idea, which clearly is apart of the problem. While the food was slightly better than average the service was horrendous. To top it off, when everything was straightened out, they have the audacity to incorporate gratuity into their total for parties over 4 people.   The promoter stated that Mangos is the only black owned restaurant on the block. It saddens me to say that if this establishment continues to give subpar service and the managers continue to dodge patron complaints, this restaurant will not be on the block much longer.  Y'all wasted my time and played with my money. Do better.",

Not sure I've ever seen a quarter chicken that small.  The sides were awful...all of them were super dry. The service was OK, but we were really thrown off when they automatically included a 15-20% tip for a table of two.  Will definitely never go back.",

(Just as an fyi - by the time we left around 8:30, the restaurant was nearly full.)  Our server greeted us and went over the special for the evening (salmon and scallops - yum!!) and let us know that Wednesdays are half-price bottles of wine.  (I already knew this, as it was a major factor in our decision to try them out.)  Their wine bottles max out around $38 - so, you're really getting a deal here.  We ordered the malbec - and liked it so much we got a 2nd bottle later in the evening.  We started with the shrimp ceviche - served in a margarita glass and chips in a cigar box.  The presentation was great, and the flavor was even better - sweet and spicy.  I ordered the salmon/scallops special and my husband got the whole red snapper pan-seared.  The food far exceeded expectations - it was cooked and seasoned perfectly.   The owner stopped by our table to introduce himself and made sure to catch us on our way out to thank us for dining with them.  We enjoyed ourselves in every way - I'm excited to go back!",

I've heard about this place when it was first opening up and of course being a fan of Caribbean food it was on my list of places to try. At first, I heard a lot of mixed reviews though to the point that I held off. While I'm the area, my bf and I were in search of a place to have brunch when we drove past a place that was packed and see there was a live DJ playing some of our favorite songs when I realized it was Mango's I told him today should definitely be the day that we try it. I won't lie for the amount of space they had adding the DJ made it extremely loud and a bit hard to talk with your party. I ordered the tropical fish and grits with a side of scrambled eggs. The food ended up being good but the eggs tasted a little funny maybe because of the way they cooked them (it's not your traditional scrambled eggs). The only other thing I noticed was that although our service was decent a lot of the servers were arguing with each other. I would constantly hear the bartender threaten servers that if they didn't do (blank) today would be their last day and they were getting fired. I don't know how serious she was but definitely don't think that's a way to carry yourself around customers",

Coming from Miami, I ate A LOT of Caribbean food and hell, I'm half Puerto Rican so I know some shi- but Mango's really comes through for me when I have a craving.   Every single time that I have gone, the service was more than friendly. I've been here on numerous occasions with my boyfriend, brought family here when they visited in town, ordered from them on DoorDash.. you get the point.   Food wise:  The jerk chicken wings are a must!  I've had their Oven Roasted Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Oxtail, Snapper.. all were phenomenal. I don't know how you can go wrong with anything that you order from here. Honestly, the cooks do such a great time. I think out of the many, many times that I have ordered here only once did the food not turn out right and it wasn't even a huge misstep. Just chicken drier that normal and again, that was 1/10.   So if you're looking for some great home cooked Caribbean type of meal.. this is the place to be.   Pro Tip:  They have Salsa nights on Friday nights. It's so much fun to be eating, dancing, drinking the night away while you're dining. Eat in plenty and dance off those carbs haha! They'll teach you basic Salsa, Merengue and Bachata steps too!",

They had two servers on a Sunday who had to take care of the tables, bar, and to go orders. My food took over 30 minutes.  I ordered the oxtails (that came with two sides) along with a side order of rice. My main hesitation when ordering oxtails is that you won't get enough bang for your buck. That was definitely True in this case. I've never seen beans in oxtails which just seemed like filler to give you less of the main course.   Individually Scored: Oxtails: 3/5 Rice: 3/5 Macaroni: 3.5/5 Cabbage: 0/5  The cabbage was too crunchy and too underseasoned for my taste; it honestly lacked flavor. Everything else was edible, but I told my roommate that I wouldn't go back. Also, my meal was $22 which was another reason I'm good on it. Hopefully I can find some good and generous Jamaican spots here in Charlotte.",

Me - jerk chicken with red beans and rice and collard greens. I did not receive you red bean and rice and the rice I had was over cooked and extremely dry.   Mom - Asian chicken wings and salad. The wings were under cooked and the salad was SO BASIC!   Granny - Salad with chicken added, her salad was basic also with a few strips of chicken breast added. Certainly not worth the $16.   Cousin - Empanadas and red beans and rice, again they did not give her the red beans and rice either as she requested.   Nephew - Hamburger and fries, he's burger was burger and hard on the bread.  We did not noticed any of this u til we made it home as we ordered our food to go. Seeing as though we lived on the other side of town we did not return the food.

Preparing Jamaican dishes takes lots of time and attention and Mango's gets it all the way right.  I don't have one negative thing to say about this place. My jerk shrimp with rice and beans is a dish I'll remember for a very long time and use to compare many other Jamaican dishes in my future. For realz. So authentic. So flavorful. So delicious it has me reminiscing. I may have to even call up my Jamaican friend just to say \"hi.\"  Well, maybe not that good but close.",

So no I wasn't eating corned beef and other Delicacies that are normally attributed to Saint Patrick's Day. I went to the top, and the jerk chicken who was delightful. This is my first visit to Mangos and I found your location to be colorful, tropical authentic and a nice spot to sit back and listen to some great music.   On the other side is service. The waitress that waited on me was great, but terribly overworked, she needed some help for a outings such as this one. Waffles, waffles, waffles. Let's talk about the waffles. Mine's were delightful, light and fluffy, leaving me only with the desire to have more. The Jerk Chicken was spiced well, but as one that likes it hot and spicy I could have used a little more jerk seasoning.   All in all this was a great experience and I will return the mangoes to try some of the other dishes especially their fried plantains.",

    "text": "Worst restaurant in Charlotte I've been to since I've started living here in 2013.   Went with a friend tonight. Got roasted chicken.  I tried to make it work with the sauce they provided.  It was inedible-- chicken tasted fishy due to the oil that was reused.    Staff proceeded to tell me they couldn't make a mixed drink because their vendor didn't deliver the soda.  Cool no problem.   Brought me out a watered down ginger ale.  And then returned a few mins later and I let him know the ginger ale was watered down and flat.   He the returns and proceeds to tell me the vendor made the delivery and that they got the coke for the mixed drink.  And brings the mixed drink without asking me.  I'm not sure what it was, but it was most definitely not Coke.    Not sure how they got a delivery of soda at night all of a sudden.   Then get charged for an item they forgot to bring me. And when the food was so bad, I politely said, if I could cancel the one side dish, since they forgot about it.  The gentleman brought it out anyway, and the item was cold, soggy--again, didn't touch a bite.   The waiter literally carried away all my food at the end,  virtually uneaten, and didn't ask a question.   Then when I got my change after I paid, staff proceeds to tell me they would have to go next door if I wanted all my change back.    The quality of the food is subpar, as well as the service.   Maybe I ordered the wrong items, and maybe it was a bad day for the restaurant.  Who knows...  Cheers-",

    "text": "Just went here on a Friday night and the service was HORRIBLE. My friend recommended it to me coming before in the past and her having a good experience.  Something was completely off with me visiting with her again.   The place was not that packed and we were quickly seated. Our waitress initially was quick was taking our orders and then everything went downhill. It took 10-15 to even get our waters that we ordered. We also ordered some appetizers (we got here at about 8:30pm). Going on 9:00 our appetizers still had not come. We ended up telling the waitress to cancel the appetizers and take them off our tab because at this point they were just going to be coming out with our main course which is not the point of an appetizer. She maybe refilled our waters once the whole time we were there.   We eventually got our food about 45 mins later around 9:15pm. It honestly took so much for me not to walk out, however I noticed everyone else in the restaurant was having issues too. Our waitress was the ONLY waitress in the whole building they only had one.. on a Friday night.   Me and my friend both got the Jerk Chicken, rice, and plantains. The food was really really good. The jerk seasoning was done well and not deathly hot. They left the chicken on the bone which was good for juiciness, but kind of annoying with having to pick bones out as you eat it. The plantains were cooked to perfection. The rice was just regular yellow rice.   Sad that the food was good , but the service was so bad I wouldn't come back. I overheard I am assuming who was the manager say they only had one cook and one waitress (who was new) which makes no sense to me. The one waitress looked very stressed and like she was going to breakdown at any moment.   If you want to take a risk on the service then go for it. Won't catch me going back.",

After we sat down we decided to start with chips and salsa. So glad we did that! After TEN minutes of waiting we left. If you can't get chips and salsa correct can you get anything correct?",

    "text": "I've been to Mango's three times! Once for lunch, Sunday brunch, and Saturday night dinner. The food taste really good, but I would say I couldn't compare it to other Caribbean restaurants in regards to recipes. I think one of the biggest differences I notice are the seasonings and the food not necessarily being as smothered in sauce. The rice also has more of a drier, firm texture than moist (based off of three visits). It is still tasty but different! However, their oxtails are everything and more. Oh my!!! And their tropical fish and grits for lunch. Yassss!!!  Last night, I was able to try the caesar salad too and added shrimp. It comes with 4 shrimp and grilled pita slices (I think thats what it was) drizzled in caesar dressing. It fulfilled my needs for last night but I would recommend the lettuce being properly drained. I could tell the lettuce was just washed as much of the water was in the bottom of my plate causing my dressing to thin out. I would also recommend more of the green pieces of lettuce because much of it was left on my plate being that it consisted of the hard pieces of lettuce. I call it the spine of romaine lettuce.  Other than that, this is definitely still a restaurant you don't want to miss. Despite my recommendations, I obviously still enjoy it as I've been three times and will continue to go.",

Mangos probably has one of the best carribean food in Charlotte. Meat is just fall off the bone tender and the flavor is just perfect.   Appetizer I ordered the tropical hush puppies, they were good the tropical sauce that you dip into was good.I would definitely order again they just didn't really blow my mind.   Now here is where the money is at the Entree. I had the Jerk chicken and it really had the right balance of spice to it, not too hot but just the right amount of heat to remind you who really was the Jerk that ordered the dish. It came with 2 sides I opted for the fried plantains I mean fried bananas how can you go wrong seriously, they were fried perfectly and that sweet sweet flavor damn they were good! I also had the roasted veggies again squash, zucchini, carrots, peppers, & onions all just cooked perfectly nothing soggy or over cooked you can tell it was all just fresh veggies they used. I'm sure I'll be back!",

Consistently is not difficult, especially if you have a head chef and the same recipe. This is why I am baffled by the inconsistency of chicken curry roti, as evidenced by my posted photos.   The first time it was perfect. The second time it was completely different and quite oily. I also ordered the cabbage which was so undercooked that I had to send it back. Consider the fact that I appreciate an al dente vegetable, and it was still undercooked even for me. Not to add, lacking flavor.   I stayed because I was starving. If such was not the case, I would have left.   The only factor that encourages me to return is the fact that the manager was accommodating. Of our party of 3, 2 people were greatly displeased with their meal. He was gracious enough to comp most of my meal and all of my guest's meal. He also received the constructive feedback and committed to communicate with the chef.   I will give Mangos another shot.",

My husband and I both ordered the jerk chicken and waffles and saltfish fritters as an appetizer. My husband is from Jamaica he said they were not authentic but good. I agreed. They were very tasty.   Our main course came out fast. My pet peeve is when I am served waffles or pancakes without syrup. So we had to wait about 5 minutes or so to get syrup. Once we got the syrup it was cold (maybe room temperature) this did not bother my husband but it bothered me because my food had already cooled down and now I am putting cold syrup on it.  My husband got the rum punch and it was really good and sweet. We will definitely be back to give this restraunt another try. Oh and the day party was a hit and the DJ and hype man were excellent!",

    "text": "Stopped by on a Wednesday evening, which wine bottles are 1/2 off! Yay! Started with the fish fritters and empanadas. The salted fish fritters were not for me. I didn't taste the fish at all, it was very eggy and doughy for me. They had a good flavor coating the outside of them though. Huge empanadas! These were a little well done and the chef knew that, so without evening asking we were brought out two more perfectly done ones. And they were delicious!   I got the jerk chicken platter with a side of plantains and rice. The chicken was so flavorful! Loved all the spices and little kick it had. I ate all my rice and I sooo wanted more! Watch for bones in all chicken dishes! Plantains were cooked perfectly.   I left stuffed and with half my dinner for the next day. Cute little spot in the heart of NoDa.",

The restaurant design, music , and food all give you island vibes; very comfortable dining area and bar inside. The waitstaff were very friendly, and I found the menu had a lot to choose from including a special brunch menu for the weekend.   From the brunch menu I chose a seafood wrap with breakfast potatoes. The wrap was to come in a green wrap with scallops , but they were out of this by the the time I arrived. The chef was courteous enough to come out and explain what other seafood he had and could include and let me know it was going to come on a white wrap.   He could have kept this info to himself, because what he brought me was exceptionally good. Generous portions of seafood, swimming in spice and sauce ( but not to much sauce) with tasty veggies mixed. The wrap was grilled to perfection and the bread was fine. The wrap was so large I couldn't finish I all , but it reheated well at home the next day.  I HIGHLY recommend you try Mango's if you really want something with a lot of flavor .",

    "text": "Finally getting around to rating Mango's after several trips. Went to MCR during its initial opening and the one consistent thing was the food was great. The waiter I had on opening day must have been a friend of the owner filling in cause it wasn't the best but over the course of my visits the service has gotten better and better.  During my last visit, this has to have been the best yet. Our waiter was just this cool guy who knew his liquor, made some great recommendations to one of my friends on food and was very attentive/personable.  So on to food  Food again has been very consistent over the course of my visits, never had an issue. I'm a curry chicken guy which I've had so many times from other restaurants & authentically made & MCR can definitely hang with the big boys. Friends ordered a few other dishes and they mentioned it being to spicy so I would suggest asking about spice level if you're not a spice person. Mine was spiced perfectly.  If you're looking for good Caribbean food and in the NODA neighborhood stop by MCR for a plate and a cocktail you won't be disappointed. They have live music from time to time and the crowd is pretty live here I means it's a Caribbean spot so come for the food and stay for the experience. Can be pretty loud if you're looking for a romantic outing so sit on the patio for a little privacy/quiet.  FYI - They have a very cute outdoor area.",

We were first put on a wait and seated by the hostess. After sitting for about 10 minutes waiting for our server, the manager/owner told us we needed to get up because the seats were for people who wanted to order food (which we were). She then asked who seated us at the table, I told her the hostess. She goes away and we wait 15 min longer for a server. (I have no issue with the server, she was very polite, just swamped).  Later the manager proceeds to bring out our meal but when I told her the order wasn't right she seemed irritated and snappy. Lastly towards the end of our meal after waiting 20 min through the check process (server printing check, signing, waiting for it to be picked up etc) she asks us if we have already paid bc she had other people she needed to sit. I understand restaurants get busy but I also feel that there are better ways to handle and address customers. I won't be returning, the food was good tho. (I'm guessing they have multiple managers but the one during this encounter had a low haircut)",

People were crowding the bar and blocking the hallways. It was rough to engage in conversations with the people you came with because the dj was blasting the music as if he was playing for a stadium. These massive speakers are right next to dining tables, so you can only imagine. It only took forever to get my drink & I was looked like I was crazy when I asked if they had coffee available during brunch. The veggie burrito was bland, cold and soggy, had to send it back. Only had to wait for forever. The server kept forgetting about us and kept bringing us the wrong food. Service staff looked frazzled, but the Supevisor was nice & checked on us after I returned my food. he couple next to us complained about the service too. The Mac & cheese, fritters and French toast were good, not sure if I would come back.",

We also had more than 18 come and they accommodated for the extra people.  Already going above and beyond. Once we were all seated we ordered cocktails and beers. Our waitresses were very diligent and never messed up our orders. The cocktails are absolutely delicious and well worth the price. I ordered the mango rum punch and tried my sister in-law's gorilla milk which were both very tasty. Then the food orders were made. My fiance and I split the ceviche with shrimp, the pork nachos, and the goat curry with rice and beans and green beans. Each food order we made we were blown away by the amazing flavors and spices. I tried bits and pieces of everyone's food and with 18+ people you know most of the menu was selected and everyone was super impressed. It was also DJ night and he brought a lot of fun to the restaurant. He even turned the music down when we sang happy birthday and post blowing out the candles played \"in da club\" by 50 cent. With such a large party I was expecting less than impeccable service, but that is not what happened. It was the best. Thank you to the awesome staff and owner for making my fiance feel like he had the best birthday ever!!! Everyone should come try this place and get a cocktail, some nachos and enjoy the ambiance. You can't go wrong with that!",

    "text": "I have been to Mangos a total of five times since they have opened and the fifth will be my last. I was sold on the Jerk Chicken wings after the very first experience. I felt they were official. Perfectly seasoned and grilled accordingly. This past Friday I called and ordered 12 wings to go and was advised ready in 10 minutes. I got there in 20 minutes and they were brought out cold with very little jerk sauce, and were baked!!! I spoke to a so called Manager who took them back to be warmed up and insisted that they were cooked the same way as always, baked and then smoked! Also he had the audacity to tell me that e was told that I was advised they would be ready in ten minutes and I came after 20 minutes!!!! I was VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED AND PISSED!!! Not only at the food but the service. There's never an excuse for COLD food ever and furthermore I could've came an hour later and it should not have mattered. Needless to say, I will not be back.",

    "text": "I'm Jamaican & Guyanese so I know good curry, but because of my ethnic background I have been reluctant to try many Caribbean restaurants in the Charlotte area as they tend to leave me depressed and disappointed. Luckily my fellow Yelper's reviews convinced me to get out my comfort zone and boy am I happy I did! The curry is almost as good as my Jamaican born mother's. The buss up shut (Paratha Roti) was so delicious, I ordered more! The plantains were cooked to perfect, soft (but not mushy) and sweet. I have already sent messages to my West Indian friends letting them know Mango's is worth a try and of course I've volunteered to join them :) Check them out you won't be disappointed! BTW: don't go to a Caribbean restaurant and order jerk chicken tacos...we don't eat jerk chicken in tacos!! It's not authentic to our culture or our food. If you're a newbie, start with the curry chicken, rice & peas, and plantains.",

    "text": "I'm really glad something like this came up in the Noda neighborhood! Noda lacked some carribean flair! Now don't expect this to be your average Jamaican joint (Charlotte really doesn't have any good spots besides Island Grocery - which is actually a store) - the portions are fair - not excessive or huge but not underwhelming either. The island salad was a side thing like cole slaw but so refreshing I asked for an actual order/bowl. I got the curry chicken and it was spiced perfectly and delicious. The rice and peas were a fair serving and fragrant and pleasant. Plantains? Cooked to perfection. It's a bit pricey but you pay for the environment and service compared to a take out spot so I can't complain. Hope to see this stay and thrive so whenever I come back to visit I can come here",

I didn't feel the portion size matched the price. It wasn't unfair, just wished it was more or a couple $ cheaper. Service wasn't the best, but it may have been due to the time and staffing. Despite that, staff was extremely nice. I would go back but may go with another food selection.",

She was quite forgetful and got the food order wrong. The curry goat is too spicy and the curry chicken isn't \"traditional\" curry. It is more of a \"rub\" than anything. It isn't worth $18 for a \"main\" course at all. I'll stick to MaMas off central avenue for traditional Caribbean/Jamaican food.",

We ordered two drinks, and it took about 15 mins to come out, and my vodka on the lack of rocks was so watered down, I guessed that it was just sitting that is why I barely had any ice. I ordered the shrimp curry with rice and black beans (I wanted cabbage, but the waitress said they didn't have any ) the shrimp curry was very good, but again it seem like it had been sitting because it was not very hot! Maybe, I just didn't have a very good waitress because the food was rather tasty (even though they didn't have cabbage,) so I will try this place one more time in the future, and hopefully I will have a different experience.

Today we found a new jem @mangoscarribeanrestaurant that has made this  #puertorican #woman believe that Latin & Jamaican can be magnificent together. The drinks are Soo good.The food is not only good it's fantastic with just the right spices. As a #nyrican I never believe people can makes tostones right but they mastered it and with home garlic sauce that's out this world . it made this #synic a believer a brand new regular customer.

I don't know if they were overwhelmed by the crowd but the service was horrible. We sat at the bar first while waiting for our table, we got mango mimosas and a pitcher of rum punch from the bar. Both were mainly juice. Once we were seated it took our server maybe 10/15 mins to acknowledge us, the food took a while to come out, some items were cold. Then it took maybe half an hour to bring the checks out after we asked. Luckily we knew the guy who was throwing the party so told him to put our checks on his tab because we we're tired of waiting. The food was average, mac&cheese wasn't seasoned, chicken was a little on the dry side, cabbage was decent. Nothing wowed me. I really wanted to like this place. Being I'm in noda every couple weeks to get my hair done I thought I'd have a new place to grab a bite while in the area but that is not the case. I'd come back for a drink and appetizer and would meet friends here if they wanted to go, but I wouldn't choose this place to dine in again.",

The food was great, they had a pianist playing great music (of course, my funny valentine was one of the selections).  The food was perfect.  I had the curry chicken, rice and beans and roasted vegetables and it was so good, I could've had a second helping.  My son had the jerk chicken, rice and beans, and fries.  He loved it.  The fries weren't just ordinary fries.  It tasted as if it had some garlic Parmesan added (but didn't confirm that).  The atmosphere was relaxing and inviting.  Almost like I could've laid near a fire place with a book and enjoyed the meal.  The host was so warm. He gave me and my daughter a rose (which made her night).  I will visit this place over and over again.  It's right in the heart of Noda, so I would definitely make it a stable.",

They may have a small menu, but it includes traditional Caribbean fare and choices for most tastes.  They also have a good cocktail and beer selection.
