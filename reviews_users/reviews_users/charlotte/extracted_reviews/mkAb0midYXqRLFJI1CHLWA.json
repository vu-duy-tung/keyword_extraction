I will never go here again and waste $26!! I know we went at 8 and they close at 9, but u should always have hot food & food that taste fresh! Not day old!! No stars for this place!!

It presents as a fast food restaurant but believe me, it is quality BBQ food. All 3 of us in our party got the sampler platter. It came with chicken or pork, ribs, chicken tenders, 2 sides, and a piece of toast. $10, can't beat it. I tried all 4 sauces placed on the table and they were great. Would definitely eat here again!",

The chicken fingers can be ordered grilled which is healthier than fried  Everyone enjoyed their meals. Portions are good sized.  The BBQ sauces came in three varieties and were tasty. The sweet tea was also good.  Drinks are self-service.  The place was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful  I gave it four stars because the place was much better than average in all aspects and we will return when we are in the area.",

We chose chicken, 4 lrg sides, 4 toast  and gallon of tea, $30. Price is not bad at all for what you get. My issue was with BBQ chicken. All they did was cut up their boneless chicken breast and pour a TON of BBQ sauce over it. It did not mimic the pulled pork at all. It was not nasty, but I guess I expected something different. It was flavorless other than the sauce it was drenched in. They could of at least threw the meat on the grill to give it the smoke flavor. If you eat pork and you're thinking of trying the pulled/chopped chicken....DONT! I will go back, I just won't ever venture out from the norm.",

Pluses for the food include, pork that is a good mix of inside moist pork and the outside crunchy bark.  The ribs are fall off the bone tender and have a mildly smokey flavor.  On the minus side is that the pork has very little smoke on it and the consistency makes it seem like it is kept in a steam table as it's a little on the soggy side.  Three of the sauces, regular, hot, spicy, taste about the same and I can't really figure the difference between the hot and the spicy.  All have an overwhelming chili powder taste.  The mustard sauce is a bit on the sweet side for my tastes but not bad overall.    The service at this location is pretty fast and definitely friendly.  At the end of the day, Shane's is a once a year kind of place for me as it takes about that long to forget that it's just ok and not really worth the effort.",

Order names were called loud enough to be heard above the crowd, yet not be annoying. Food orders were processed in a timely manner considering the size of the dine-in and carry out Customers.

    "text": "Just had a quick lunch at this location near NorthLake Mall.  You know for a chain BBQ jiont, it is great.  Actually, chain or not it rivals many here in Charlotte.    I had the combo sampler platter with pork, ribs and chicken tenders,  I admit tenders are an odd item for a BBQ place perhaps.  But these are the biggest tenders I have seen.  A choice of sauces or grilled if you prefer.  Very good.  The pork was juicy and tender, the ribs fork tender and full of flavor.  But the ribs seemed to be more steamed or something like that rather than cooked low and slow on a smoker.  Sides were good too.  VERY cheesey M&C.  Yum.  The platter was pretty big too.  Maybe too big for lunch. I'm stuffed.  In and out in 30 minutes with friendly service.    Sure you could find better BBQ joints but this one won't be a bad one any time.",

It came with 2 sides so I got the fried Okra and Mac n cheese. The pulled pork was very tasty and super moist.  The ribs were fall off the bone delicious cant believe I finished both because the portions were huge! Fried Okra was fresh with the perfect balance of seasoning crunch on outside and soft on the inside.  Mac was good and cheesy! I am giving it 5 stars because the food and  staff.  Staff picked up my bone dry plate and cleared the table for me.  I will definitely return for more!",

I live down the street so I wanted to call my order in around 915 and a lady answered and put me on hold which was fine initially. I was on hold so long I decided to go ahead and get ready to head to the restaurant I had time to get dressed get in my car and drive all the way there still on hold. I walked in and three girls were standing at all three cash registers talking to each other,  I proceeded to let them know that I had been on hold for 20 minutes at that point I received no apologies in a very smart tone one asked if I was ready to order. I couldn't believe how nonchalant and unapologetic all three of these women were! Worst experience ever, I do not plan on ever going back. There are only a few restaurants that are good enough to deal with bad service and Shane's is not one.",

Okra was right out of the freezer so nothing special there either.  I suppose this is what you get when you pick a bbq place that's basically located at the mall.  Live & learn...",

I had the two meat plate-great pulled pork-actually cooked but still juicy (I don't use the \"m\" word to describe food...that ruins it!) and the smoked wings (non-breaded) were tasty as well.   I had medium buffalo sauce on these and would recommend it.  Sides were good-co-workers with me liked the baked beans and fries, I liked the mac and cheese-very gooey!  A very relaxed place that takes a little effort to get to from the main road but is a good lunch spot that I'll visit when/if in this part of town again.",

Hang in there this ends well - I continue to go to this location over driving just 5 or so minutes further because MOST (not all but most) of the employees here are super customer service centric.

The only thing I would change is how the meat is put on the bun.  I hate biting into big clumps of meat.  In the middle of me eating, I had to stop and open my sandwich and pull the big clumps of meat apart and spread it evenly.  Other than that the sandwich was very good, and I will be ordering it again.  thank you",

    "text": "Oh Shane's how I have missed you!   I used to live in walking distance of the Afton Ridge Shopping center and when the Shane's Rib Shack location opened up there a over a year ago it instantly became a favorite in our household. Not living as closely now I haven't been as frequent a visitor and driving by last week I was extremely disappointed to find out that they have closed recently. Not really sure why as they were always busy (and had decent Yelp reviews!) but I had not given up. A quick Yelp search showed two locations still alive and kicking and I needed to get my fix.   This location is directly across the street from Northlake Mall, luckily not far away. The inside is what I've come to expect, clean yet sort of rustic black and white motif. I ordered the 1lb chopped barbeque chicken (I was rather hungry) and a drink and sat down. Food came out quick enough and I finally got to feast. The chicken is as delicious as I remember. Moist, tangy, just enough spice. There are sauces on the table for you to have your pick of flavors but I personally don't find it necessary on the chicken, it's wonderful as is. There are so many wonderful restaraunts with all sorts of barbeque dishes so it's really hard to pick a \"best,\" but if your speaking strictly chicken, this is near the top of my list. I didn't get a side, but my dish did come with four pieces of Shane's secret weapon, their delicious Texas Toast! That bread is truly wonderful. Soft and light. I know it's just buttered bread, but it's damn near perfect buttered bread. A little tip, some of there sandwiches (like the \"Big Dad\" pulled pork) come on the Texas Toast and some come on a plain bun, but they will always sub out the normal bun for toast if you ask. It can only make your experience better.   This place does not disappoint and I plan to visit again soon.",

I felt welcomed and like part of the family.  The cashier/Jay took the time to explain what our coupon meant and other options to expand on our order! Not to mention it was Father's Day so the place was packed out, he didn't try to rush us or anything and he was multitasking and helping another cashier! Now the extraordinary part is my car broke down in front of there establishment and Jay offered to help he also went as far as saying he would see if his manager would let him take me to a repair shop if I couldn't get a ride!! Who does that in this day & age!!  This man went well over above and beyond for his customers!  Which made my day go a little better considering I was stuck smh. He deserves a promotion...he's an invaluable employee,  because customer service like that is non-existent.",
