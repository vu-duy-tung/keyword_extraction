    "text": "A real strip mall gem.    If you are staying at the Four Points around the corner and you don't feel like BBQ tonight, I suggest going here.  The food is great and it's open until 10 pm.   The decor seems authentic, at least to someone like myself who has not been to Vietnam.    There is a giant fish tank.    The large dining area contains plenty of round tables with lazy Susans.  I'd suggest sitting at one of these even if it's just a small group, because a booth table will fill up quickly with little plates, large bowls and beers.  Plus, you can play Wheel of Pho-tune with your buddies.    The wait staff is friendly and efficient.   The menu contains hundreds of items and is numerically organized.  Our waiter didn't write anything down, so there was some suspense after the ordering process.  But, as far as I could tell, everything we ordered came out exactly how we ordered it.       Food-wise:   Don't bother with the shrimp appetizer.    The cucumber salad was OK.   I recommend this stuff:   Butter fried Quail. Chicken Pho  Vietnamese pancake with pork and beef Glass noodles with beef  Spring Rolls.    Another group we were with tried the beef and seafood Phos and had nothing but good things to report.    All in all, a dining experience you will never Pho-get.",

I wasn't impressed. being the first ones there I don't know if they had left overs out first but food looked old and dry. the rice did not look fresh. the chicken wings were fried way too much be they were dark and burnt. had some spare ribs stride fried and they were so hard could not eat it. Me and my daughter just threw those to the side. the egg noodles had no flavor. just very oily. I did just eat banh xeo. It was the only decent and fresh thing out.

Expensive as hell.  10 for a regular? Get a xe lua and you're looking at Vegas prices.  Com bi xuon chung - Okay, 10 dollars for... a few slices of cucumber and tomato,  a fork full of bi, 1 highly undercooked egg, and the toughest slice of porkchop I have ever had.  The overall problem besides the tough as leather meat, was the pretty bad nuoc mam.  Bun Bo Xao - The friggin noodles were so undercooked.  And again, the nuoc mam was blah.  To sum it all up... MEEEEHHH.  The food was all just MEH for a big price tag.  Maybe, the reviews are good because this is the best the area has to offer.

One person eats apps faster than a group of people, and usually, should be a priority when sending food out.  There was only another couple eating there and the decor was semi-formal, with five lovely chandeliers and red tablecloths on all tables.  Asian music was playing in the background, something I really enjoyed.  (I feel like ethnically appropriate music enhances the dining experience.)    The service was great and the staff friendly.  My water glass was never empty, and the waiter was attentive and prompt.  Courses came out in a timely manner, and by the time the main course was served (lemongrass curry with shrimp and potatoes), I was stuffed on spring rolls, both fresh and fried.  The shrimp were large and thoroughly deveined, (something I'm picky about), and perfectly cooked and tender.  The portions were large, and I had plenty leftover for lunch today.    A great experience, can't wait to go back.",

My son-in-law is of asian descent with an asian chef as a father and he shares my opinion of the buffet.  Overpriced and mediocre.  We arrived after the rush so maybe the items were better when they were fresher.  The pho bar was good with lots of stock choices and add-in ingredients. Dim-sum limited to one type.  It was ok.  Quail was really good.  Fish dish had good flavor, but only heads and bones remained of the fish.  Shrimp were tough and I can only enjoy a couple of them when you have to eat the shells.  Other items were ok.  Dessert like many asian dessert bars was easy to pass on.  We saw several dishes come out of the kitchen that looked really good and all of us wished we had ordered from the menu instead of the $16.95 buffet.",

Large lazy susan full to overflowing with condiments (fish sauce! oil based chili that isn't as hot as it looks! etc) and utensils sitting in the middle of your table.   Decent selection of tofu entrees and apps, but the veggie pho is where it's at. Ever since our Viet-training-wheel event, I've been  semi-obsessed with vegetarian pho and have had it at a number of queen city mainstays - but Saigon's is best, has all the correct additions, and is almost the cheapest. So that's awesome.  Other than that, the menu is ok but less extravagant than BT's or LV's. Those guys set a high bar, and there it is. But as they do not have a vegetarian pho option, I will drive out here to order Saigon's. Happily.",

You can divide your ticket very easily and without additional charges.  I went the all veggie route and ordered #4 appetizer of tofu spring roll and #72 tofu and vegetable noodle bowl. It wasn't as flavorful as the seafood noodle bowl (with sliced pork). However, once I added some extra ingredients that they brought to the table (e.g., sprouts, jalapeno slices, lime wedges) it became just right.  The portion is large, service great, and environment easy going. Also, I was impressed by their \"to go\" containers... very sturdy and no spillage.",

By the same token, satisfy my hunger for comfort food and I will sing a restaurant's praises until the cow's come home.  Saigon Palace is the first Vietnamese restaurant I've eaten at in Charlotte.  When I saw the unassuming strip mall and the restaurant sign, I had to stop and try a taste of home.  The restaurant is spacious, more like a Chinese banquet hall then is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant.  The menu has the usual staples, but somewhat concerning were the Chinese dishes and buffet that they offered - all atypical of a \"real\" Vietnamese restaurant.  However, the staff were indeed Vietnamese (I could understand what they were saying.)  I ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (Vermicelli, Pork and Egg Rolls).  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The dipping sauce was very sweet and did not have the body and depth of good dipping sauces.  The meat was cooked well and pretty good.  The egg roll was mediocre.  As a whole, the dish was average.  Priced around $8, I am sorry, but I expect more.  I'd try it again, but wasn't all that impressed during my first visit.  The atmosphere is confusing - with buffet tables and a large interior, it left me cold.",

BTW, I'm not a huge fan of guac or avocados in general, but in smoothie form - it's addicting.   The grilled pork over rice/vermicelli is flavorful and the portion size will definitely fill you up. The meat to noodles ratio is higher than you'll find at other Vietnamese restaurants, so you're not left at the end with a bunch of noodles you don't know what to do with. The banh xeo (yellow sizzling pancakes) was mehh as I think it could have used double the filling (bean sprouts, thinly sliced pork, and shrimp) and the outside shell was a bit on the crunchier/darkened side. However, it was served right with plenty of green leaf lettuce and herbs to wrap it up and dip in fish sauce...yum.   It's been a while since I've had the noodle soups but I remember them being darn tasty. Until next time...",

Vietnamese fare is much lighter and full of flavor than what most Chinese restaurants serve!  Your best bet is to order either rice noodle soup (pho) or a noodle bowl.  My absolute favorite meal of all time is Pho Tai: a bed of rice noodles topped with thinly sliced beef, green and white onions, and an amazing broth.  You get to add fresh basil, lime, hot sauce (to taste), and bean sprouts.  I have a nearly ritual habit of leaning over my bowl to inhale deeply of the aroma before digging in.  Vegetarians and vegans have some fairly extensive choices available as well.  The Pho Che (veggie soup) is wonderful as well, with fried tofu and succulent broccoli.    If it's too hot out for you to try the soup, a cool noodle bowl topped with beef, chicken, shrimp, or tofu is just the thing!  Just how good is it?  Our children (10 and 7) regularly ask to go to the Saigon Palace to have the seafood noodle soup.",

The pho was good - they served it they way we like it, with the steak to the side so we can cook it as much as we wanted (rare).

It was actually incredible! (I was on a date and that didn't stop me from man-handling these bad boys) they were delicious. I had never had Vietnamese food before so I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said #45. This was a noodle bowl with pork(that was to die for) and a bunch of stuff. I honestly can't even tell what all was in there but don't worry it's listened in the menu. Because I was knew to this I didn't know you pour the sauce that comes with it on top. This took my meal over the top! I absolutely LOVED it. So much flavor and so fresh. To top of the meal, and the date, I just had to have \"bubble tea\" or boba as I know it. I had mango and my date had strawberry. Go with the mango . Overall, I absolutely love this place and the food! I am an absolute fan and will be back many, many times.",

Restaurant didn't mind while some places hate it.  The place is clean and pretty large.  It must get busier during the buffet hours.  The staff was helpful but nothing special stands out about the service.  Pho was a little more than other places, like $1 more.  It's not a huge difference but it's not like their pho has better flavors or portions than other places in Charlotte.   TIP: Onion-lovers, ask for a plate of sliced onions and squeeze some Hoisin and Sriracha sauce onto it.  Then coat the raw onion rings well with the sauces.  Grab a little and enjoy it in the same bite with noodles.  Standard trick all pho people should know!  dmo out.",

This is a nice clean restaurant that has a huge Vietnamese /Chinese Menu. Some of the best food I have had here in Charlotte. We had a big birthday party there and yet we were  waited on very quickly.  We started out with the Deep Fried Spring Rolls which were filled with Pork. A Nice sweet and sour sauce on the side.   I had the Vietnamese Pancake- it was so delicious, I have never had anything like it before. It was a crispy fried pancake stuffed with shrimp, pork belly, Bean sprouts and served with fresh cilantro and leaf lettuce. Outstanding! My daughter had a Vermicelli rice bowl that was served with Cucumber and grilled beef / alot of fresh veggies and a light sweet sauce that was very refreshing. My husband had the Crispy Fried Noodles, ( huge noodles) that had a wonderful grilled flavor, this was another dish like the pancake that I have never had.  My son had the Rice with Grilled Pork chop and A Sunny Side up Egg.  Service was informative and quick...Definitely will be making another trip back to this very special place~",

I've been going to this spot for months now and it has consistently been a wonderful experience.  If you're unfamiliar with Vietnamese food then this is a great place to start.  They have plenty of options if you're a hardcore vegetarian and lots to choose from if you LOVE pork.  Their normal menu is a bit on the pricey side, so I suggest doing the Sunday brunch buffet.  The shrimp spring rolls alone are worth the price of admission and the Vietnamese pancakes (Banh Xeo) are mouth watering.  Quick tip, try to go early if you can.  There are many, many families that come here.  For some it's a weekly tradition.  Going early is key to avoiding the rush.  Also, you have to try their Vietnamese iced coffee made with condensed milk.  The combination of espresso and sugar are enough to knock you out of any food coma.",

Bright neon lights outlined the windows of the restaurant - only foreshadowing what was behind the doors. The decor consists of fancy chandeliers, wall murals, an aquarium full of large, bright orange fish, and a lot of red.  I ordered the Create Your Own Steam Rolls with the shrimp and pork. I loved the concept - eight sheets rice paper, boiling hot water, and a variety of fillings of my choosing (consisting of bean sprouts, lettuce, cucumber, carrots, vermicelli, etc.). Overall, the rolls were pretty good, but I wish the ingredients were fresher. We did arrive there at 8pm, so I'd like to give them benefit of the doubt here. My partner ordered a vermicelli dish and he gobbled his entire bowl up.  The bubble tea on the other hand was phenomenal! It was not only the perfect amount of sweetness, but was also blended very smoothly. They did not skimp out on the amount of bobas either!   If you're in the Charlotte area and craving Vietnamese - definitely try it out. If you're in the Charlotte area and craving bubble tea - drive here right now!",

Vietnamese style brunch, they transform this made to order restaurant to an all you can eat buffet. Make sure you get here early as this place is pretty much packed for it, because of the quality of dishes that they serve. The buffet definitely differs itself from every other \"Chinese\" buffet in that they only do it one day a week and well, the food is good.   They stick to one thing they know. Vietnamese food. They don't have pizza or sushi or even BBQ. It's not a large buffet, but they're efficient in sticking to their own specialties. That's why this buffet is better than the usual \"formula\" buffets. They have broths, pho, pork, fried egg pancakes, spring rolls, grilled pork, and the most popular: quail. Yes you heard me, quail. What restaurant would be crazy enough to put that on a buffet? And when it comes to the dessert, it's all Vietnamese desserts. No pudding here!   And it's not like the food is mediocre either. The quail is seasoned and well cooked. All the dishes are actually, and you truly can sample a lot of the dishes the restaurant serves during the week by just coming to the Sunday brunch buffet.   I've been sticking to this restaurant throughout the years and no wonder this restaurant is still in business. It's the community and the quality of the food that year over year they deliver. Check it out if you're in the area.",

I guess they were looking for timing after the dumplings.  The sauce with the dumplings was not tasty. Brown, hot and flavorless.

So when I heard Saigon does buffet on the weekend it sounded like music to my ears.   The restaurant was stuffed with patrons, half did buffet while half still ordered a la carte. I could see why because the buffet section was pretty weak: it consisted of 2 steam tables located in the back of the restaurant. However I came too far to back down so I stuffed myself with the buffet's offerings. The buffet was split into 4 sections:   1. Soup section: they had bun bo hue broth (one of my favorite Viet dishes) that you can add to the noodles on the side. I also tried the beef tendon and carrot stew which tasted really good. My biggest concern would be the level of heat (or lack of) from the steam table. The soup was lukewarm and that is a big no no for Vietnamese broth. 2. Standard cooked Viet dishes. They had sauteed noodles, various meat dishes, spring rolls and my favorite: quail. All were pretty standard in flavor but the quail seemed to be the showstopper  3. DIY noodle bar. They had 2 different type of noodles, noodle toppings and fish sauce where you can customized your noodle dish to your liking. 4. Dessert: pretty weak but that was ok for me since I wasn't looking for dessert coming in.  Would I come in again? Probably not. While I like Vietnamese food, the quality was too poor for me to make the trip over again. There are so many options on south boulevard that Saigon really needs to step it up.",

Saigon Palace came highly recommended for the food, and I was certainly steered in the right direction!  On a scale of Pretty Bad to Excellent, the food at Saigon Palace gets a solid Great.  The Pho was delicious and had a ton of vegetables.  Definitely about two meals worth in one bowl.  Broth wasn't too salty, and you could add different sauces to spice it up.  Don't forget about the appetizers!  Steamed pork dumplings had dough that was a bit thick, but the flavor was awesome (and they give you a ton of dipping sauce, too).  Spring rolls were pretty normal.  Would I recommend this place to others?  Absolutely.  It's not a place where I would go on a fancy night out, but if I'm just craving some really good Vietnamese food, this is the place to go.",

Our service was also atrocious as the waiter never came back to our table after taking our orders. There are plenty of other places around where you can get a good bowl of pho, but not here.",

    "text": "I don't get the 4 star rating here. We came here because the place up the street was closed and I really wanted some Vietnamese food.   We ordered a few appetizers. First let me say this, I couldn't believe they charge almost $8 for 4 fried eggrolls with lettuce. This is the highest I have seen for this anywhere in my life and I was immediately turned off. That is just highway robbery. So we ordered the 2 individual ones and they were alright. Not bad, but not the worse. Just okay.  We also ordered the garlic chicken wings which are deep fried chicken wings covered in this amazing sauce. This was hands down the best thing we ate. I mean it was delicious.  My 4 year old son loves pho but with broth and noodles only. They didn't have a kid option and they charged me $8.00 for a bowl of noodles and broth. I repeatedly asked for noodles and broth only, no onions, no cilantro but of course it came out with all onions and cilantro. If you are making me pay $8 for a bowl of noodles and hot water, you can at least bring it the way I asked.  I ordered a bowl of bun bo hue for myself and it was lacking serious flavor. It was too oily and with the lack of flavor, I was mad at myself for even ordering it. I asked for shrimp paste to try to help give the broth some flavor and instead they brought me chili oil. I get it, they probably didn't expect me to ask for shrimp paste but at least listen to me and don't assume that I don't know what I am asking for. They finally brought it out and while it helped the soup some, it couldn't save it.  My man ordered a stir-fry dish with meat and veggies and he said it was just okay. He didn't finish it and he didn't want to bring the leftovers home, which means he really didn't care for it.  Yeah, we won't be back.",

Both the fresh spring roll and the pork skin roll were completely boring, in spite of the tasty (but I think commercially made) peanut sauce we didn't finish them.   My all time favorite Viet dish is spicy lemon grass, here it was offered with chicken. NOT spicy, not particularly tasty either, the veggies were ok but the chicken was tasteless and mealy ... I suspect old. Not bad but not very good, in fact I'd rate Ben Thanh's lemongrass squid is FOUR stars better so there you have it it.   The Buhn (bahn?) with fried spring roll, pork and shrimp (3 small ones) was pretty good. Mild again but tasty enough so as not to make me feel completely cheated, just disappointed.  I don't know if the owners stopped trying or if they never did, but there's a defeated atmosphere in the air, maybe because compared to the competition I'd rate them dead last?",

The service is wonderful, and the owner herself constantly buzzes around, making suggestions and making sure everything is covered. This place is also extremely veggie-friendly: there is a special section in the menu for my Hindu parents :)  My only (slight) complaint is that the chili sauce they offer is not the traditional sambal oelek, but rather an off-shoot form of it.

But those that enjoy sinning (me included), don't worry, they have your stuff there too. I really like their setup for congee (rice soup) and the bun (rice vermicelli noodles) which they provide a ride range of meats send vegetables that you can throw into that bowl. Oh, I'm so full!

    "text": "I have been frequenting this restaurant since Ken and Maria opened the doors many years ago.  The food is simply delicious, and I have been hard pressed to find a restaurant that stacks up in comparison to Ken's delicious Pho and Cracked Rice Plates.  One of my most favorite things to order here are the fresh Vietnamese spring rolls, they are soooo good.  If you are looking for the best food, in a family friendly and warm and inviting atmosphere, Saigon Palace is highly recommended.  I crave their food at least once a month, and going to this restaurant has become a regular routine for myself and family since I moved here almost 10 years ago.  Oh yah, and don't forget to try an avocado shake...it is absolutely to die for, and a pleasant and refreshing surprise. Penny in Charlotte, NC",

Saigon is for sure one of the best Vietnamese restaurants we have visited so far in Charlotte area as such.  The traditional Pho is yummy and the quantity they give makes sure you dont leave hungry.  Kind staff, very attentive and quick on feet.  Last time i tried one of their \"Create your own steam rolls\" - Grilled Lemon Grass Chicken.  It was fun working on this dish, lol.  You basically get everything like veggies, herbs, sauces and the meat with some lettuce, dry rice wraps and hot water, just have to dip the dry rice wraps in hot water , place it on the place and stack whatever you would like and just roll it up, it sticks nicely and doesnt spill all over when you take a bite.  The hostess was kind enough to teach me to roll my first steam roll, taught the trick in rolling as well.  Loved it, but was difficult to finish the whole dish, there was a lot.",

I decided on our last visit to venture into the Chinese side of the menu and try shrimp lo mein. It was pretty good but I still prefer their Vietnamese dishes. My boyfriend tried these Chinese wings and said they were \"just ok\". He loves the egg rolls though because they are \"meaty\".   Try this place out but go with the Vietnamese dishes.",

The food was fresh , moist & delicious on its on .  I would recommend this place to others. The portions are large enough to share family style so it's very economical too.",

I am giving 3stars bc there just wasn't a WOW factor with the soup flavor , it had me feeling content on getting my pho fix but I started thinking of other soups I've had that just tasted better . I didn't like the minimal selection of side sauces to add an extra kick of spice , I'm use to the hot pepper oil, sesame oil, hoisin sauce , etc being available but there was only sirracha and soy sauce on the table. If you are looking to receive fast and friendly service you will get it here , the prices are pretty standard and the ambiance casual , there is a buffet option but I didn't have a chance to check it out.",

I thought it was an odd concept before ordering it but now it would be sacrilegious not to order it! Anything beefy in the pho is the way to go. They have perfected the tendon in all of their pho. It's creamy and melts in you mouth with a richness that never gets old. The brisket is so flavorful you'd think Guy Fieri was planting a flag in the name of flavortown in your mouth. Fantastic service and have no complaints whatsoever!",

    "text": "I've eaten many a bowls of pho in my lifetime, and have been to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte. I would say this place is pretty decent, although not spectacular. Compared to phos of other Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte it tastes very similar. I think the one thing that stands out about this place is that they have buffet on the weekends. I have never gotten the buffet but plenty of people do. They do get very busy on the weekends and that speaks well for the restaurant. A lot of asians frequent this restaurant and that also goes to show that they have some pretty authentic food.   As for the pho, I would say the broth is decent. I haven't really  They used to put more meat in their bowl, but as it has been with most restaurants recently, everyone is putting less and less ingredients in their dishes. Must be the economy. They do give plenty of sides (bean sprouts, basil, peppers, lime) unlike some other restaurants. Their semi-raw steak is very thinly sliced, which is good for both the restaurant and myself.  I'm pretty sure they put a good bit of MSG in their broth though because I get the after effects of it (drowsiness, dry throat). Although, that's not a deal breaker for me since it makes the food taste better. Just have to drink plenty of water if you plan on drinking the broth.  Something about the service at this restaurant. This is really strange. Apparently they don't have waiters working in sections, their waiters work the entire restaurant. So we had a lot of overlapping service which became extremely annoying the course of the meal went on. We had a waiter come up to us to ask for our drinks. We told him. 3 minutes later, another waiter came up to take our drink orders. Same thing happened with our food order. It was funny at first. Then one waiter kept asking my friend if she would like to have bubble tea. My friend told the waiter no, and he asked her, really? Are you sure? So my friend, being nice, told the waiter that she would think about it and order it if she wanted it. Another \"Sure?\" Yes, she was definitely sure now that she didn't want a bubble tea. During the course of the meal 3 different waiters stopped by multiple times to ask us how the meal was, but we were very engaged in our conversation so it got pretty annoying. On its face you might consider this good service, but I would call it disorganized service.   Still the food is good enough, and the location in close proximity enough to me that I will still go eat at this restaurant once a month. So I'll give it a low 4 star.",

It was the first time I had the fried eggrolls served without any veggies at all. I thought it was strange to see the eggrolls by themselves. I was so accustomed to eat the eggrolls wrapped in veggies, dipped in the fish sauce. Their fish sauce had a surprising touch of garlic and chopped red pepper, The eggroll itself was not so inspiring.  Having sad that, the pho itself was wonderful. This was one of the most visually pleasing looking pho I had in a long time. All the proper combination of fresh veggies and beef parts were mixed in right proportion. The broth tasted slightly flat, however. Very clean restrooms, but in serious need of upgrades. Friendly employees and good service. I will definately go back whenever I have a pho craving on my CLT layover.",

I was living in an are up north that had a sizable Southeast Asian community, and there were at least six Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance of my house. Not having a lot of spare cash coupled with the fact that the Vietnamese eateries were quite affordable meant that my friends and I would quite often find ourselves with bellies full of pho and vietnamese iced coffee. Fast forward many years later and I'm glad to find that there is an excellent choice for Vietnamese food a quick hop from my current abode.  I've been to dine at Saigon Palace close to a dozen times and it has been consistently good. The staff has been friendly, the service great, and the food has been extremely tasting and satisfying. The Pho is quite good as is the Bun. Also, the quail appetizer is outstanding. I did manage to make it to their Sunday buffet lunch which was very cool. It was packed and the place was buzzing with families and large groups happily chowing down and enjoying the food and conversation.  Saigon Palace has pretty much everything I could ask for in a regular dining stop.",

The egg rolls had a hint of cinnamon in them which at first taste kinda reminded me of christmas. The interior of this restaurant is decorated amazingly. I was very impressed with the pride they obviously take in their establishment. A lot of these strip mall type restaurants give you the feeling that they are making the bar minimum effort to dress the place up but Saigon Palace actually has a well done up dining room. The only bad things I could say about the place is that the 4 person tables are a bit small. It was only myself and one other person there but I could see the table already getting loaded up with plates even between the two of us. Also, service was a little slow but since the food was worth the wait it barely registered after the meal was over.",

The service was good; my drink stayed full.  I really enjoyed the decor.  There were at least two large fish tanks that looked very clean and housed gigantic, interesting looking fish.

Had a great taste. I do think the noodles could have been cooked slightly longer. The atmosphere is casual and slightly busy for a weekday. I felt the tables were a little to close together. At least in our case they were. We could hear every part of the conversation of the table next to us. This could be that they were absolutely rude and very loud. Im aware that some of the dishes are hard to pronounce when ordering but to intentionally butcher the names and laugh was dissrespectful. Then again this truly doesnt have much to do with the restaurant itself but the people at the next table. Its why I bring up the issue of the tables being close together. The Pho itself was a really large portion which made my husband very happy. He had a hard time finishing,  which is rare. The noodles were cooked enough and did not remain in clumps. He ordered the dac biet version which usually comes with pieces of tripe. In this case it was cut into strips. We will definately visit again.",

If you're ever in need of a hangover cure, I highly recommend their pho. The broth has been perfect the last few times I've been and it just hits the spot! I love going on Sundays for their Vietnamese buffet (the only one in Charlotte)! It's a good way to try out a plethora of Vietnamese dishes including traditional soups, dishes and dessert. I recommend:  1. Quail - Must get! 2. Vietnamese Pancakes/Crepes - make sure to get the fish sauce to eat with this dish! 3. Summer Rolls - use the brown (hoisin) sauce to dip these in. I like to add peanuts and sriracha on top 4. Bun Bo Hue - build your own with veggies on the bottom, then noodles and then pour the soup over!  These are my favorites from the buffet, but you can also order these from the menu! I usually stick to the pho when I'm ordering from the menu :) good luck!",

It shares the parking lot with Office Depot and some other businesses but I found it a little ominous that it wasn't as busy.  The restaurant front does make a first impression with its red neon lights.  I admit, I was a little skeptical at first, but I really was surprised.  Was craving Pho and their menu does tout there presence as a noodle house, but it also offers Chinese food offerings.  There is also a setup for a buffet (I would imagine its only set up for lunch).  The dining room is a bit cavernous... large chandeliers hang from the ceiling from a couple of decades removed and the murals of jungle windows make for an interesting ambiance.  Servers are quick and friendly... always making sure we had water and that we were okay.  The overall dining experience was great and the food was a treat.  I had the chicken pho. I was super excited to see a variety of vegetables hidden in my pho.  Yes you get the standard, beans, mint, and  jalapenos to drop in...  but there was a generous portion of chicken and noodles... pea pods, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, and lettuce made it like a treasure hunt to see what veggies you can dig up on your next bite.  My friend ordered from their standard Chinese menu... sesame chicken... it looked delicious and had larger chicken portions (less breading) and the rice came separate.

    "text": "I went with a group to check out this restaurant the other day, and was pleasantly greeted with its spacious, bright, red decor.  We went on a weeknight, so it was fairly quiet...and we were quickly served, despite the large size of our group.  Being the Bubble Tea fan that I am, I started with their \"Original\" flavor...which was their basic Milk Bubble Tea.  On the sweeter side, but I loved it enough to order 2 before the night was over.  As for the meal, I decided to go with one of their combo Vermicelli bowl, \"Bun Dac Biet\", which included all types of meats and spring roll over a bed of Vermicelli noodles and veggies.  Although the meats were good, they tasted a bit bland.  In fact, one of the meats (the shredded pork?) tasted alot like the Korean Dwaeji Bulgogi, but milder, less tasty.  The noodles and veggies were fresh, but not too savory.  I've always preferred the more heavily spiced and flavored Asian foods, including the thicker, tastier noodles (versus the milder/blander, though possibly fresher and healthier Vietnamese Vermicelli).  In any case, I was impressed with the decor and their expansive menu.  I may give it another try in the future.  Maybe I'll try their Chinese entrees next time?",

The chicken PHO just went on and on and on. I thought I would never get to the bottom of that bowl!   Every bite and sip were just delightful.  Maybe the best PHO that I have had in Charlotte, and I have had a lot of PHO.   The service was FAST. We had barely sat down when the server was there to take our drink order. The minute the drink was delivered, the server asked us what we wanted to eat.  We asked for a minute or two to look at the expansive menu.  A minute or two were all that we were granted before the server was there again asking if we were ready. I assume that most patrons like to get in and out quickly. They probably don't realize that two retired guys who are lunching together are not in a giant hurry!  Anyway, we stayed for over two hours and enjoyed the food and the ambiance. It was a quiet place and was a big restaurant with a lot of tables. It looked a little dated, but it was clean and everything was in perfect order.  I have said it before and I will say it again. Charlotte is lucky to have so many good options for Vietnamese food. Just when I thought that I had visited most of them, I found THIS ONE!  It was another great restaurant and I am happy to recommend it!   Two Thumbs UP!",

They tasted like that really bad Asian fish smell that happens sometimes when you go into one of the Asian markets.   Spring rolls- thinly rolled with not much vegetable, but what was in it, was mush. Not terrible, but not great!  Fresh roll- ok, but the dipping sauce was the worst peanut sauce I've ever had.   Coconut Bubble Tea - the frosty coconut part was good, the bubbles not so much. They tasted like warm, huge chewy tapioca.   Thin Rice noodle, broccoli, uncooked onions in brown sauce- yuck! The broccoli was tolerable but the smell and taste of the noodle was gross!   Wide rice noodle, shrimp, and broccoli - also a disappointment for my friend. She ate the shrimp but left everything else. She said it was intolerable.   A disgusting meal for $45. How terrible!!!!",

The bean sprouts were day old and the lettuce in the fresh rolls was rather green an wilted.  The grilled pork was very tasty though and they obliged me and made the fresh rolls with grilled pork.   80% of the tables had Asian people sitting at them, though this place is a buffet restaurant at some point in the week. I was concerned that the front door says the place to go for Vietnamese and Chinese food, but they did a decent enough job with their Pho today.  So I went back a few more times and it was consistent...I'm happy with it here. It is the best in the world? No. Is it confusing that no one in the restaurant seemed to have Vietnamese food and everyone was eating what looked like Chinese food? Yes...do I really care?  No!  So, if you are in Charlotte and going to be near the airport, head by here, it's only about an 8 minute drive from the Airport on South Something or other",

What I do love, and I consider this the best Asian dish I've ever eaten, are the vermicelli bowls.  I usually get the shrimp/chicken/chia gao combo vermicelli bowl.  The shrimp is grilled with a spice combination that I am desperate to duplicate on my own.  I've never had grilled shrimp so tasty.  Throw in the sweet and sour fish sauce on top of the mint leaves, crushed peanuts, sprouts, carrots and lettuce (plus dab a spoon full of crushed chili), and you have one incredible bowl of flavor.  The grilled pork is also good on this dish.  Throw in the fact the wait staff is attentive and friendly, and you have a wonderful dining experience waiting for you here (yeah, I work in advertising, why do you ask?)",

I was also intrigued by the idea of a AYCE vietnamese buffet. So of course, we had to come back and partake of it.   I was impressed by the variety of Vietnamese dishes and soups. It was nice to see more than just pho. Don't get me wrong, I love pho, but it's great for people to see that there's more to viet cuisine than that one dish. Everything tasted pretty close to authentic. Also a number of central dishes (mmm, bun bo hue!)  Good viet food at decent prices. I'm a fan!",

They arrived late and in a dish of sauce that was so hot I couldn't pick them up for many minutes.  Before I could eat them, dinner arrived.   I ordered Grilled chicken.  The meat was fatty, and coarse.   Everything had a funny taste to it.    I was not impressed.  I reheated leftovers today for lunch, and I was reminded of how much I disliked it the first time.  I will stop at Wendy's before I go back to this place.",

Maybe if I were to like these types of food, then this place wouldn't have been so bad, but for me I'd rather stay away from this type of food.  From the outside, this looks like your normal shopping center restaurant, small & quaint. But this place is freaking huge...I was absolutely shocked. I don't know if they ever get enough people to fill it up, but they have A LOT of seating. The whole place is open, with nothing but tables & chairs throughout the whole place. No walls, decorative pieces, nothing but space & seating.  I went with an old coworker that likes this type of food so he had some suggestions for me as I frowned across the menu. Maybe to a Vietnamese connoisseur this food would be appealing, but to me everything just sounded like something I'd rather not eat. I will say that while I wasn't exactly thrilled with eating the food, they do give you huge portions.  Saigon Palace is not your typical shopping center restaurant, with its size really setting it apart. The food is probably good if you're in to that type of thing, but for me it just wasn't good. I'm sure you could get a seat here pretty quickly anytime of the day, for any size group, considering how abundant seating is. Vietnamese just isn't for me & I'll stay away in the future...but at least I tried it...",

    "text": "Having recently discovered a True affection for Vietnamese food, I've been trying to find the best restaurants to go in Charlotte.  On Monday, we tried Vietnam Grille (delicious!)  But by Thursday we were still in the mood for more Vietnamese, so last night we checked out Saigon Palace about 4 blocks from VG.  I'm happy to say that our food was pretty much on par with VG, and my boyfriend actually preferred his pho at SP.  We got almost exactly the same thing that we did at Vietnam Grille so we could compare: he got pho with brisket and steak, and I got bun with chicken and a spring roll.  We started the meal with fresh spring rolls wrapped in rice paper and served with peanut sauce--it wasn't my favorite and I probably wouldn't get them again.  But when the entrees came out--watch out!  The pho had cilantro, which I missed from VG, and the meat was done perfectly.  Only one fatty piece, which is pretty good.  I loved my bun even more, which had a lot of chicken (more than VG), well seasoned and tasty, and the sauce that came with it (mirin with some other things) we mixed with hoisin and soy, and it was delicious.  And we both had enough for leftovers!  Very happy we now have TWO great places to go to satisfy our bun/pho cravings!",

I tried the pork, the noodles, an egg roll and a chicken wing. Oh my gosh, all were delicious. The guys at my table made their versions of Pho, which each looked delicious. I had to go for a second round on the pork and the noodles because both were so awesome. (Though I did put on some hot chili oil. The price was a little higher than most buffets, but the quality of food it absolutely worth it.  The service was very friendly. Great place. Looking over the menu while checking out, I saw items that I know I will have to return to try.",

The food came out quick. I wasn't impressed by the Crab Rangoon by the Pho stoke my heart, it is probably my favorite in the Charlotte area so far.

The broth was delicious and the right amount of salty before even adding the extras. I wanted to just stick my face in the bowl and slurp everything out of the bowl.

Got your typical american chinese food like panda and normal-not the greatest vietnamese food. Me and my family ordered the pho, bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup), broken rice/combination rice, Egg noodles (hu tieu), and i got to try every dishes. It was just so basic and not much flavor. its eatable but nothing will blow your mind away. I also asked the family if they feel any type of way. They kinda agreed with what i said. normal nothing to special just basic food. Not much traditional flavor either. 1-10 i would rate it 4.15/10 and thats 10 being the best.  if you look closely. More asians on here will rate it Meh-average experience while Americans/others will rate it the best the ever had LMAOOO.   there will be a difference if you can taste it if you season your food LOLOLOL",

I've had the sesame chicken and some other type of chicken I can't remember what it was, but it was extremely dry with barely any flavor. It honestly tasted like it came out of the freezer and was reheated. Not fresh at all.   They have a $19 per person buffet on Sundays during lunch time. I gave it a shot last week and boy I will never do the buffet here again. It was surprisingly crowded, but I think most people were just curious because it's a Vietnamese buffet.

We started with crispy rolls, dumplings, and soups. They have both great egg drop and hot n sour. I was in one of those moods where I wanted everything on the menu. Our server suggested a beef dish and to add some veggies. He nailed it. Delicious. Our table also ordered chicken pho, one of the vermicelli bowls, and General Tso's chicken. It was all great. Also, kudos to our server. Not only was he great, he was also very honest and hysterical. Note: On Sundays, they offer a buffet.  One of my favorite things about this place is the fish tank behind the register. It is filled with monster goldfish and I get lost staring into it every time. I need this in my house.",

    "text": "I made it known to my wife that I had a desire for some Lomein, and fried rice. We decided to check out Saigon Palace. The reviews were awesome and it was pretty empty which to me meant no wait. Fast Forward to the... LoMein: food is subjective but I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed. I was expecting the thick noodles but instead they served up the thin noodles and they were extremely mushy. I was devastated but I'm not one to complain and send my food back. Why, out of fear of what may come back out to me.  Mongolian Beef: it was okay, I cant complain about it, except the fact that any other place that serves this could have done better. The taste was just blah, although it did look appealing.  Chicken Fried Rice: extremely unflavored. In an attempt to give my rice a little life, I added  what seemed to be half a bottle of Soy Sauce to it.  My overall review of this spot is, I wouldn't return or recommend it due to there being a million Vietnamese restaurants that serves much better food.  The environment was peaceful. It was not crowded at all and our food was delivered very fast. The service was great. For me, it was just below average food.",

I am suffering from a stuffy nose so leaning over the steaming bowl enjoying the broth was nice. I also tried their crab rangoon and it was among the better ones I have had around town. My toddler enjoyed the lomein. Unfortunately my husband did not enjoy the Chinese portion of the menu. So all in all, since this is on the opposite side of town we probably wouldn't make a trip across town to dine here but if I were in the area and wanted some pho I would stop by. A solid OK, not great but also not bad.",

    "text": "So this place is technically Vietnamese, but they also rock the Chinese food too! The other night was my second visit here and I ordered the Pho. The really nice thing about Saigon Palace is that they offer a vegetarian pho, which is hard to find. It was LOADED with veggies such as broccoli, carrots, cabbage, and mushrooms. My husband and I also shared the vegetarian spring rolls to start, which are wrapped in rice paper, are very healthy and refreshing, and come with a nice sweet peanut sauce. My husband ordered a bowl of soup (I forget which one) and the General Tso's chicken (fried), which I did taste and had both a nice texture and flavor. The best part about the meal was that it was a ton of food for a very reasonable price and we are going to get more meals out of it.   The restaurant is large and has the capacity to host groups as large as 8 around 1 table with a lazy Susan. It's nice, but not fancy. After your meal, they bring you the check and a fortune cookie and then you go up to pay whenever you are ready. No rush to leave. Service staff are very nice.",

    "text": "I love this place. I can't believe it's been right up the street the whole time. They have the best pho in Charlotte IMO. For an introvert like me it is perfect. It's never really crowded and they have great seating.   They have so many varieties of Pho / Seafood Soup. My favorite is the number 75. They take stir fry the noodles in sweet chili sauce and then put the broth on the side so you can pour it on yourself. It is such a satisfying meal. They also have another one that has shrimp dumplings in the pho! It's amazing! You'll never finish a bowl yourself.  But that's okay. You can bring it home with you. I had to buy pho spoons from Amazon just to keep the authentic feeling at home. They also have some really good appetizers I suggest the garlic wings. They are to die for.   I like Bruno Mars and I don't think what he's doing is cultural appropriation. There I said it. And I'm not saying that just because he has some jams. He seems like a really respectful guy who gives credit where it's due. Please send all your disagreements to Justin Timberlake on Twitter.",

    "text": "I met at Saigon Palace with a buddy who lives nearby on a whim. I had never really noticed or heard of Saigon before last week. Now, I'm telling everyone I know how great it is. Let me start out by saying that this is primarily a Vietnamese restaurant, but they have a large selection of traditional Chinese dishes as well. Their Vietnamese 'bun' options are actually very similar to pho, and not a 'bun' at all. There are just some things us outsiders don't understand.   I was craving Chinese, so that's the cuisine I stuck with this time around. And boy, Saigon does Chinese better than a lot of other actual Chinese restaurants I've been to in Charlotte. I started with the egg drop soup, which is very flavorful and had a nice consistency. Not that thin, watery kind you find at many places. For my entree I went with the [extremely basic in the best way] General Tso's chicken. First of all, let me commend them for actually not up charging for fried rice. YOU DA REAL MVP. Secondly, the portion was huge. I made two meals of of this dish. Lastly, it was incredible. You could tell the chicken was freshly breaded and they used premium cuts of poultry. It wasn't the standard thick & crispy fried chicken you find in general tso's sauce ... it was breaded the way sweet & sour chicken typically is, and I am here for it.   This is definitely going to be one of my go-to places when I'm craving any sort of Chinese noms.   Pro-Tip --- they've got a plethora of bubble teas. The good kind. You're welcome.",

It was crowded, lots of Vietnamese families which is always a good sign. The buffet had quite a few options including several Pho selections. There was a very hearty spicy beef broth that was excellent. My favorite dish was the grilled pork dish which had a slight sweet flavor which was really good. However, the rest of the food was meh ok. I believe Doans and Vietnam grill to be far better than Saigon palace food wise anyway. Overall a solid place but not my favorite.",

But I was very impressed with the restaurant:  - The service was very attentive (for a place like that in a strip mall) from getting seated to taking my drink order to taking my order to getting the check - and checking in mid-meal how I was doing  - I ordered the spring rolls #1 and the Pho with beef and meatballs. Everything came out very fresh - I was impressed with the way everything looked and tasted - and it was a good (and probably healthy) lunch.  I will try something else next time (maybe the vermicelli based on some reviews here) but I guess the good news is that they left a good enough impression for me to wanting to go back there.",

The curry dishes are amazing, try the chicken or shrimp curry, I think one of the best in town.  Also their other dishes such as the lemon grass have an amazing sauce.  Great place to go to in the area, prices are not high and the portions are great for a big appetite.  Say hello for us if you decide to go and I don't think that you will be disappointed.",

The chinese lunch specials are pretty decent, the pho is edible, though sometimes a little thin and the noodles ALWAYS come in a huge clumped mess... I'm constantly having to tear the ball apart with my chopsticks. However, the meats on top are always generous portions and fairly nice cuts. I've dabbled with some of their other soup selections, but I've always gone back to the phos.  The service is just what you need to get in and out during your lunch hour without feeling rushed, and the larger space definitely gives a bit more a bustling ambiance than some of the smaller asian restaurants in town, especially if they pack you in an area surrounded by other full tables. Definitely a little louder than some other lunch spots I hit, but in a good way, I don't feel like everything I say is echoing off the walls.",

Disappointing is there is no option on sizes unless you go bigger which costs more on a price that's already steep for pho. I only eat a lil bit so I wanted a smaller bowl but couldn't.  I don't know about other foods on the menu tho.",

They package to go orders perfectly so the noodles don't turn into mush.   Crab rangoons are my go to appetizer. Usually I go with the vegetarian pho, but last time I tried stir fried egg noodles with mixed vegetables. Really big noodles that were amazing! Might try to get them with less veggies next time so I can stuff my face with more wonderful noodles!  Service is always good. They are very attentive and always make sure customers feel welcome.",

(Adding sriracha sauce to it makes it even better) Not only does it please the palette it's also beautifully put together. I enjoy my food more when it's presented nicely.

Maybe I am just used to the abundance of Vietnamese food back home in Northern Virginia/DC that maybe the price point there is a little bit lower. But anyways, the food was pretty good. My friend and I ordered Goi Cuon (spring rolls) and they were so good, but I don't know how you could mess up spring rolls. I got Com Thit Nuong Bi Trung which is rice with grilled pork, shredded pork, and a fried egg. The thit nuong was a little bit sweet for my taste but worked well with the rice and nuoc mam (fish sauce). I wish they had com tam (broken rice) since that is how this dish is usually prepared but it was fine with the regular rice. I think Saigon Palace would be better if you went with a larger group as there are so many dishes that would be great to share family style instead of eating dishes individually. They have a wide variety of traditional Vietnamese foods on their menu. The service was good and the waiters came and checked on us often.",

MEATBALL in competition with Doan's and Ben Thanh though not quite as good... Comes in Third place and a Close Third place!!!   PORK chop Thick and looks like at Grandma's Meat and 3 except Southern Cooking with Much more flavor, Ginger and Spices all subtle   Beef (Grilled) better than most!  Chicken nice flavor!  Shrimp FLAVORFUL L L!  Grilled, more Flavor than almost all Vietnamese shops!  Rice is plain as.... This is \"Com\" it is supposed to be plain!  Pho... The sweet smell of Boiling Bones, this one is pretty good!  Vietnamese Style Iced Coffee is 100% If you have never had it and like a Sweet Coffee Flavor this is a nice Dessert (sweetened with Sweetened Condensed Milk).  Service. One non-Asian dude was going to wait on me for some reason I look like I tip real well??? A girl who spoke English fairly well (it was ok) wanted to see if she could take my order... If you need something ALL THE young Dudes working here Asian and non speak and understand English Very well. Some if the girls speak very little English and you may not notice they are All very good and if you do not need anything out of the ordinary (Rod0) is here and he wants something most do not know is possible or would not imagine would be or are afraid to ask... Do NOT be afraid... If you are reading this far you are Brave enough!  What does ordering OFF the Menu mean to you???  Since I say it like that you probably know I mean NOT ordering FROM the menu or in so many words making up an ideal dish and asking IF it can be done... It CAN for $17.95.... SOLD!!! OK,  I had a price in mind ($3.00 more) so I agree to their price!  From previous experiences before, not factored into the overall star rating of this review :  :  Lemongrass stir fry should be avoided  Most of the Vietnamese dishes rated by me range from 2-4 yelp stars  Chinese dishes are better than many Chinese restaurants though not good enough to repeat.  If it is important the Decor is wonderfully Gaudy like a nicely Typical Chinese restaurant and nicer looking than most Vietnamese restaurants!  Lots of Red!  No privacy, more like a High School Cafeteria style openness so my friend Mr. Hoy will not eat here",

    "text": "I have eaten here at least once a month for the past 3 years. When my BF & I can't figure out where to go for dinner, this is our go-to spot. The food is consistently tasty- I've only had a not so great experience with it the first time I came here & the first time I ordered pho. I usually rotate between 2 different apps & 4 different entrees.  For apps, I either get the vegetarian summer rolls (#4) or the fried veggie rolls. The summer rolls are filled with mint, bean sprouts, noodles, lettuce, & tofu but I don't really like mint in savory dishes & they have no problem substituting basil in its place. There are 2 pieces per order & it's served with a yummy peanut sauce & I like to squirt tons of sriracha in it.  The fried veggie rolls are not on the menu & I don't think they always have them but try asking & you might get lucky! They are just normal spring rolls but sometimes you just want something crispy to munch on & those summer rolls aren't gonna cut it! I ask for some lettuce pieces & roll the spring roll up & douse it with sriracha! I don't remember how many come in an order but it's either 2 or 4.  For my entrees I either get the vegetarian pho with tofu (#72), mixed vegetables & tofu in garlic sauce (#92), stir-fried egg noodles with vegetables & tofu (#94), or mixed vegetables & tofu in lemongrass (#98). The vegetables in all of these are pretty much the same (cabbage, carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, snow peas, & onions). Once in awhile I will try something different, but these are my favorites.  I tried pho for the first time here at Saigon Palace. I think it was sometime in 2011. I was never interested in noodle soup & I didn't understand what was so special about pho & why so many people love it. I decided to give it a try & honestly I did not like it at all. First off- I had no idea that it was going to be COVERED with cilantro. A tiny bit is ok, like in Mexican rice or something, but that was awful. I also didn't like the noodles that the pho normally comes with, but my BF told me to get the egg noodles next time. So a few months later I decided to try pho again & ordered it with no cilantro & with egg noodles & it was sooo much better. I added the fresh basil, bean sprouts, limes, jalapenos, & hoisin, & generous amounts of sriracha & I can now say that I am a fan of pho! There is a $1 upcharge to substitute egg noodles in place of the regular noodles but it makes it like 1000000x better!  I think on my first visit, I got #92 & I didn't really like it but I went again a few months later & it was really good. I don't really order it anymore because I like the lemongrass tofu better, but it is still an excellent choice. These are both served with white rice but lately I have been getting no rice & extra veggies.  For #94 you get your choice of soft noodles or crispy noodles (ALWAYS go crispy!) It is HUGE- basically it is #92 served on a bird's nest of noodles that's almost as big as the plate it's served on. So amazing & so hard for me to share whenever I do order it. This was my shit a couple of years back but I don't order it often anymore because I am pretty sure I gained 10 pounds from this alone. I remember ordering this & a few other dishes with my friend last year. When the server brought this out, some dude at a another table was like 'wtf is that, it looks AWESOME' .. well duh because it is awesome! Do yourself a favor & try this at least once.  My BF likes the chicken wings, & the different types of vermicelli dishes with grilled pork or whatever. He also likes all kinds of pho with the weird cuts of meat & stuff (tripe & tendons?) PASS.  I think the wines are pretty cheap. I think I ordered a plum wine here once & it was like $3.50/glass which is like half the price elsewhere. Also tried the Vietnamese coffee & recently discovered the avocado smoothie! mmmmm  While it isn't the best Vietnamese place in Charlotte & I'm not sure how authentic everything is, they make very satisfying meals at reasonable prices. An app or 2 & 2 entrees will come to I believe around $25-30 + tip & pay at the front.",

I usually do take out from here but the place looks very clean, nice, and spacious. I get the vegetarian pho, and I kid you not they hand you a bag that looks like you're getting food for 3. The noodles, hot sauce, broth, beans sprouts, basils, etc, all come individual and you set it up. Ive also had shrimp skewers with noodles, also delicious. Seriously, new favorite for my friends and I.",

The asparagus was tender crisp and the crab flavored base makes a good compliment to it.  The boneless chicken wing stuffed with pork was surprisingly awesome. They took out the bone from the wing then stuffed it with well seasoned pork. Think the amount of effort it takes to just make the dish!   Taro bobba tea is a good dessert with hint of clean sweetness. I did not expect to find it here in Charlotte.   What a good find!",

I usually have their vegetarian Pho, and have only tried their chicken and tofu entrees, which have all been great.  If you're a tofu fan.. try the Lemongrass tofu! Yesterday for the first time I had the coffee there... it was terrific! Extremely strong french press, with condensed milk, on ice.  Granted that the coffee and pho combo is a little weird, so I'd recommend you not consume them simultaneously :P But if you conclude your meal with the coffee, it not only serves as dessert (thanks to the condensed milk), but also prevents food coma.",

Last section has chinese food; a dead giveaway that this place isn't where you would bring vietnamese people.   Bun bo hue was super oily and bland. Waiter served it with sriracha and hoisin. All viets know you never eat that with Bun Bo Hue.   I mean it's viet but not good viet.   I would come here if I was forced to or drunk.

    "text": "Charlotte always seems to have a plethora of Vietnamese pho restaurants in town. With so many selections it always seems to come down to choice and what you like and don't like. Better yet, know and don't know about pho and Vietnamese cuisine.   Coming from a household that actually cooks pho, I think I know what a traditional and healthy bowl is. Meaning your broth isn't made from concentrate and instead made from ox tails, packs of seasoning that contain star anise and Saigon cinnamon and so on. And most importantly, NO MSG. There's no need to have a flavor enhancer in a broth if the broth is made with wholesome ingredients. And lets think about that. Big old pot of water, ox tails and seasoning doesn't cost that much. A restaurant can easily make their money back by serving one table alone.   That's something I wish they did here. The broth was sub-par and lacked the kick of cinnamon and the smokey aroma of black cardamom. It was just ok. Nothing special and really memorable coming from the soup. The beef brisket was high in fat and the beef tripe was a nail sized sliver dashed throughout the soup. Like I said, nothing special. The garnishes were very fresh though and I was thoroughly pleased with that. Service was attentive and fast.  What really killed me was the price. Nearly $10 for a bowl of soup. It's difficult for me to even justify that price in my own head. Rice noodles, broth, veggies, and meat. That's all a bowl of pho really is. It shouldn't cost more than $6 a bowl. I don't own a restaurant though, so who I am to say?   If you're in the area and don't have time to make it to another pho restaurant in town, this location will suppress your craving.  *They do have much more than pho though and I will definitely come back to try their spring rolls and bun thit nuong.",

And honestly, I much prefer Saigon Palace over Vietnam Grille from value standpoint; you definitely get more and better food here on any given day.  This Sunday I came to try the Sunday buffet ($13.95pp). I think it's worth the money. I love the fried quails which were perfectly seasoned. I think I got $14 worth of quails alone. And if you're into soup, you're in heaven. There were only half a dozen of soup base to choose from (mostly for you to put noodles in, but I kind of eat it plain). I personally thought their stir fried noodles with beef & veggies was the better noodle option. They also had rice soup which sadly I didn't have room for. The disappointing items was the summer rolls, you could tell they're made in a hurry, and the shrimp wasn't fresh. BUT the fried spring rolls more than enough made up for it.   Overall for $14 it's a great value for an authentic vietnamese/chinese buffet.",

He came back in about 2 mins asking if we were ready to order ... No not yet. After we ordered the food sort of made me forget how much of a jerk he was.

Having never been, I checked out the buffet, which had a great selection, I was a little overwhelmed and asked to order from the menu. Maybe not the right choice since the menu was 7+ pages long, with very little descriptions.  I started with the spring rolls & peanut sauce, and the egg drop soup, both very good. I then ordered the shrimp with vegetables and fried rice. The portions were very large, which I enjoyed for dinner, but both good.  I will say the fried rice was the BEST I have found in Charlotte! As for the three, here goes.  Although the food was good, I was disappointed with the overall service.  There are plenty of waiters there to attend to you, however, there isn't one specifically assigned to your table so there are different people bringing the water, meal, receipt, etc. which turned out to be a mess. And, without knowing how the restaurant works I felt a little out of place.  I will say that I will definitely go back and try the buffet as that seemed to be the thing to do among most of the other patrons. Overall I enjoyed the meal and would recommend this spot for vietnamese and pho lovers.",
