I recommend the sesame tofu with broccoli. Menu is vegetarian friendly and almost any meat dish can be substituted with tofu. I'm definitely partial to Cherry House because their egg rolls, rather than spring rolls are vegetarian. Yay!   FYI - take out menu has coupons on the back!",

    "text": "Aside from the fact that the name sounds vaguely like an Asian brothel, we found the place to be a cut above the normal strip mall Chinese take-out joint.  My wife and I had a little time to kill and stumbled upon Ho Ho Cherry House at lunchtime and decided to give it a go.  Table service was pretty good and the staff was all very nice.  The only thing I would say is that I would like it if they paid a little more attention to the timing and waited until we finished the appetizers before bringing the entree.  We had fried dumplings and BBQ spareribs to start.  The dumplings were delicious, plump, tender and flavorful with a dipping sauce that was better than the usual offerings.  Ribs were big and meaty with the normal amount of chewing and tearing required to eat a Chinese restaurant style rib.  Nice char but not enough sauce.  For our entree we shared the Szechuan shrimp and scallops.  It was hot, fresh and flavorful without being overpowering in any way.  The seafood was perfectly cooked, although I suspect that the scallops may not have been real as they seemed too perfectly round and all the exact same size with a strange texture, more like a plug of fish and not very scallop like.  Veggies were all very fresh, texture was perfect and the balance was just right.   I do have a pet peeve regarding shrimp in a sauced dish such as this - Take the freaking tail off of the shrimp.  It is a hot, sauced, stir-fry and we had to take our fingers and pull the tail off of the shrimp before eating it.  I'm OK if it is a shrimp cocktail or jumbo fried shrimp that you can grab the tail as a \"handle\" and pick it up but, not in a piping hot slippery sauced stir-fry...please...it just makes things messy.  The decor is exactly like any other of this genre and it seemed pretty clean from what we could see. The free wi-fi is a nice touch too.  We will be back.",

    "text": "I gave Ho Ho Cherry an extra chance to keep me on there customer list. But I get the impression they do not care..I know owner or mgmt changed since 2016. I have had Moo Goo one of my childhood favorites,delivered in some sort of brown gravy, I was 6old that was how they make it despite the menu claims white sauce. So that fell from fave list quick.. Back in June I ordered Egg Foo young and not only did it come with beef broth instead of the gravy,only 1 patty eatable the other was burnt and I thought it came with 3 patties? So despite those fudges I got a taste for fried rice yesterday, easy simple I didn't feel like making it they make it all day long can't go wrong. Boy  was I wrong! What's the special of the day pork fried rice I have never had dry tasteless lacking ingredients fried rice before in my life the rice was dry and I mean dry dry it was Bland even with the meat and little bit of peas and onions it had no flavor I couldn't help thinking what did I just spend $6 on that I could have made at home. I had all the ingredients I just didn't feel like making the mess I'll smelling it so I learned the lesson that's it that's the third strike after seven years since 2010 I'm finally throwing out my takeout menus for ho ho Cherry House never again. It took them 9months to undo 7 years of patronage.. A friend laughed at me and told me I need to try anywhere else.. oh gave them 1 star for having me out in less than 5mins",

    "text": "Cherry House is good for two things: quick and inexpensive Chinese food. Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But, hey, they carry most of the westernized classics.  US CULTURE TIP ON THE USAGE OF THE TERM \"CHOW MEIN\": I learned from my experience here that there is a difference in the US between East and West coast conceptions of chow mein. On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \"Hong Kong style\" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \"chow mein\" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \"lo mein\" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?  At Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down.  That said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13? I've had worse.",

    "text": "I lived in Houston for nearly 20 years, and ate Chinese food all over that city, whose Asian population is among the most vibrant in the U.S.  Since I moved up here, I've eaten at just about every hole-in-the-wall Chinese takeout and \"Asian bistro\" around.  I thought I was past the point of having my doors blown off by a dish, but the Cherry Special Chicken here did it from the first bite.  I ordered it expecting something akin to sweet and sour chicken with a cherry twist.  Sweet and sour isn't my favorite (My young sons, of course, love it) but I had to give this a try.    What a revelation!  Yes, there's the sweet-tartness of cherry, but there's also a spice kick that put sweat on my brow (I requested it extra-spicy) and a panoply of other spice notes throughout.  Oh, and the hot and sour soup is actually spicy and brilliantly sour.  I order this almost everywhere I go, even though it's usually \"meh\" at best.  I could eat it every day.    And the sweet and sour chicken my sons got?  Yeah, it was good.  But let's face it, if you can't get THAT right, you'd better close up shop.  The service was very friendly and attentive, and the entrees didn't come out until we'd finished our soup.    I'm already looking forward to my leftovers for lunch tomorrow ...",

    "text": "Best steamed dumplings EVERRRRR (in excited Oprah voice)! Ho Ho Cherry House is a reliable neighborhood Chinese restaurant that does primarily takeout/delivery business. Service is generally very quick and friendly.   The menu is pretty long and features standard fare. The dumplings are always perfectly steamed and they usually throw in a couple more than the count says on the menu. Some of the fried foods can be a little on the oily side. Online ordering is definitely a bonus!   P.S. They have coupons on the Clipper app sometimes, though the app is not user friendly.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying I hate when reviewers slam a place for something minor.  This is an important forum for their business to succeed so when people overreact negatively to something minor it's unfair.  That said, they also need to be mindful of that and handle customer service accordingly.  I think I was actually being generous with the second star.  So for the service, it's far less about making a mistake vs how you propose to resolve it.  Ordering the dinner combo comes with a side.  Mine didn't show up in my delivery order.  When I called to notify and seek out a resolution, my options were pick it up (probably wouldn't have paid for delivery if I felt like heading out for a forgotten portion of my order) or have a credit to receive what I ordered for now, at a later time of purchase.   When I asked for something that would actually resolve this (have someone send it out, give me a credit for an appetizer in the future, refund delivery fee, etc I was told nothing could be done.  The food was primarily bleh.  Ordered two spicy dishes and asked for extra spicy on both.  Sha cha and Kung Pao.  Neither was spicy at all.  Very bland.  Fried rice with dinner combo tasted like a very minimal effort toward fried rice, otherwise pretty close to white rice.  The other dish my wife ordered Sesame Chicken, was good which deserved to be noted.  Also do provide large portions so definitely more than one meal so plenty to share, have leftovers, if you get something worth finishing.  Some things done right but looking for a go to Chinese restaurant they won't be close to making the cut.  If the service had been handled correctly, I would've sought out other dishes that could have been done well but I'm not interested in missing parts of my order and having to try em yet again to get everything I paid for.",

    "text": "It's Monday night; I'm hung over, tired, and have been wearing the same two-week disposable contact lenses for so long that the calcium deposits are creating white blind-spots on my periphery. Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House.   It's Tuesday night; I have a six-pack of PBR in the fridge and four episodes of the CW's break-out hit Arrow to catch up on... Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House.   It's Wednesday night; I'm supposed to be meeting a coworker for trivia at some dive-bar in Ballantyne, but it's that sort of awkward cold outside where it's too chilly for shorts but not quite cool enough for long pants. Plus, I don't have any clean socks. So I blow it off and call Ho Ho Cherry House.   It's Thursday night; my ladyfriend and I have a hundred bucks worth of unassembled Galaxy Squad LEGO kits stacked up on the coffee table and the latest Channing Tatum action flick pirate-bay'd. Who do we call? Ho Ho Cherry House.   It's Friday night; I'm supposed to be meeting up with my friends to hang out around a fire pit and drink beer and talk about life, but I'm \"feeling kind of sick\" or \"I'm really busy\" or \"Really? I didn't get that text\". Instead, I'm calling Ho Ho Cherry House.   It's Saturday night. AJ and S are coming over to drink gin and play old school Mario with the lady and me. We wanna grub up but AJ and I are unsuccessful in convincing the women to cook us something. So we call Ho Ho Cherry House.   It's Sunday evening; the Panthers are playing a late-game at San Francisco. I have a free-pizza coupon from Papa Johns stuck to the front of the fridge. But who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House.   The point is - no matter the day, no matter the situation, the only reasonable answer to your desire for Chinese delivery is Ho Ho Cherry House.   Sesame chicken. Shrimp fried rice. Egg foo young. Crab Rangoons. Those gnarly little dumpling things. A bucket of General Tso's. A freakin' boat-load of Lo Mein. A lil Mei Fun to keep things crazy. It's ALL GOOD.   Seriously, if you're in their delivery radius (from 7th street), hit this place up. It's very consistently good, the delivery drivers are friendly and professional, and their website has super-convenient online ordering so that you can get through 90% of the experience without having to speak to another human.   On those nights where you just wanna stay in, be lazy, and gorge yourself on something cheap, delicious, and oh-so-not-good for you, Ho Ho Cherry House is it.   Let me emphasize one thing: The name of this restaurant is HO. HO. CHERRY. HOUSE. An inspiring entrepreneur selected for the name of his or her establishment, Ho Ho Cherry House. This is a real thing that is happening around us that we can all be a part of. No joke.   It's Chinese takeout that tastes like Chinese takeout. It's predictably, unspectacularly exactly what it's supposed to be.   Very few things in life infuse me with as much pure joy and anticipation as someone uttering the words...  Ho.  Ho. Cherry. Houuuuuuussssseeeeee.",

Yep, he's a big dork.  I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with my standard veggie lo mein while the bf ventured out and had the Cherry Special Chicken.  We also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon.  Well, the lo mein, first of all, was not lo mein at all.  It was actually chow mein and that did not really work for me since I prefer the wide, flat noodle usually found in lo mein dishes.  It was fairly bland and the veggies were scarce.   I mean, c'mon, it's veggie lo mein!  Give me something here!  The crab rangoon filling was nothing short of disgusting....it tasted like either ricotta cheese or curdled, mealy cream cheese.  Yuck!  The Cherry Special Chicken, however, was pretty darn tasty.  I ended up sharing with the bf because his food was way better than mine.  The sauce was a sweet/spicy combo and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried (i.e. not too greasy).  The only downside:  the cherries were of the marischino variety and tasted just like what you would expect: like they came from the bottom of a Shirley Temple.  Overly sweet and not so appetizing.    A mixed review all in all.....maybe if I branched out and tried something different, but I think next time, I will just go pick it up from somewhere else.",

I typically order one of the same three things every time I get in the mood for Chinese take out:  General Tsao, Chicken and Broccoli, or Triple Delight.    I LOVE their General Tsao, it is spicy but not overly and I think the sauce is the perfect amount of thickness.    I tend to go for noodles instead of rice, but do enjoy their steamed or fried rice.  The girl on the phone knows me (by my phone number) and usually asks me which of my staple three entrees I preferred that night.  That alone adds a brownie point.  The food is prepared quick and steaming hot - I typically let it sit on my counter for 10-15 minutes before even attempting to eat the steaming goodness.  I recommend this place as a quick take out spot if you are in the mood for delicious, fresh and fast Chinese (americanized) food.",

It's reliable and fills that Chinese food craving that we all have with great food. It blows away the Chinese takeout competition in Charlotte easily.  Pros: Good prices, pretty good portions, delivery radius is pretty big compared to other delivery places, food was solid  Cons: Delivery took a while, took about 1 hour 30 mins when the expected time was 1 hour, so the food was not as crispy as it should be  Recommend: General Tso's chicken (pretty hard to mess this one up), crab rangoons, fried chicken wings  Long story short: Good, reliable Chinese take out in Charlotte which, from my experiences, is quite rare.

    "text": "I placed an order and waited over an hour for it to be delivered. When it finally got to me part of it was missing. Of course the delivery guy didn't understand the problem and just told me to call the store. The lady I spoke to informed me that there weren't any drivers to bring me the missing items. Although I could hear her asking an employee if they would bring it and they just refused. She told me I could come and pick it up myself but that wasn't an option seeing as how I have a knee injury which was the reason I ordered delivery in the first place. She then offered me a $5 credit. Not sure what good that will do me since I don't plan on ordering from here again. This is not the first time I've had an issue with this restaurant. A few months ago I waited almost two hours for an order that never arrived. Each time i called they just told me they were busy and it was on the way. Never showed up. Ho Ho Cherry House has got to be one of the worst establishments in this area.",

There are two types of Chinese places, one you eat in your PJs on your sofa after a long day or really long week and the other where its nice enough to eat at the restaurant. Charlotte has slim pickings of both types. Ho-ho falls into the eat in your PJs, sofa Chinese. I've gotten several different dishes from Ho-Ho since it's fast, cheap and never caused me any heartache.  Heartburn yes, but, what do you expect? Sometimes its better than others, but overall, it always been a solid Chinese take-out option.",

    "text": "Man, I really want this place to be good... but it's not.  A shame - it's so convenient to get delivery (especially when it snowed, hah).  Quintessential Chinese take-out isn't all that great in the first place, but Cherry House's dishes don't even measure up to that standard.  Probably the most annoying thing about the beef, chicken, or shrimp entrees is the abundance of vegetables.  Don't get me wrong - I love my greens, but there just isn't much in the way of protein.  Having ordered a variety of entrees, each of them just go overkill with the veggies.  You feel cheated - the dishes should be along the lines of \"snow peas, carrots, and a sampling of shrimp.\"  And to make matters worse, despite the diversity of dishes available, there's about three flavor profiles available:  (1) salty; (2) sweet; and (3) sweet and salty.   Hot and Sour Soup - They're doing it wrong.  The viscosity is off, and it's neither hot nor sour, really.    When my sister visited and tried this place, she said everything from there tastes like broom handle.  I've never had the pleasure of trying broom handle (and I don't know how she would know...) but I take it that it's no filet.  For me, the coup de grace was hair in my food the last two times I ordered!  Supremely unpleasant and tossed it out immediately.  You want to believe it was an accident the first time, but when it happens twice in a row... it's no accident.  Something's busted with the people, product, or process.  dmo out.",

I called and spoke with a manager (something I NEVER do, honestly my sister ended up calling cause I'm really not one to complain even with bad service - character flaw I guess lol) who apologized and said they'd issue a refund.

The service has always been mediocre, but today it was so disappointing that I doubt I'll ever eat there again. My son and I sat down around noon and within a few minutes we were brought menus and our drink order was taken. When my water and his coke were delivered we placed our order for 2 appetizers and 2 lunch combinations. The appetizers took a little longer than usual, but the restaurant was about half full so I wasn't surprised. When the plates were put on the table the server asked if we wanted anything else and I mentioned that we had entrees ordered. For the next 50 minutes most of the other diners were served and finished their meals and left. During this time none of the restaurant staff bothered to check on us, or offer refills on our drinks. When my son commented that all the new customers that had entered after us had received their food, and still no one had checked on us, I decided to go to the counter to ask about our food. After a few minutes the counter person returned to say that she was sorry, but our order had never been placed with the kitchen. She gave a lame apology and said they were having a problem with one of their computers which was not an acceptable excuse. They had no problem getting our drinks and appetizers to the table so at least part of the order made it's way to the kitchen, and if anyone had bothered to check on us and see if we needed refills we could have reminded them that we were still waiting for our entrees. Service was never great, but this was the last straw. Charlotte has an overabundance of fast Chinese restaurants with comparable food and I'm guessing at least a level of service where customers would not be ignored when there are only 11-13 tables in the entire room!",

I did not receive my egg roll with the combo which wasn't that big of a deal but The sesame chicken was stringy, chewie & inedible. I called to get a refund for the only the sesame chicken & I was told that they couldn't refund my card & they would bring me back cash but they would bring it to when when they could... estimated time 1-2 hours. The girl at the other end of the phone proceeded to tell me that my request for a refund was pissing her the F***k off. I hung up on her & called back, got the manager who was still not able to give me a refund for the food that is inedible & she has to talk to the owner. I won't recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever give them my money again.",

I always order a take out of their honey wings with veg. lo mein or fried rice and I'm always pleased. Wings are crispy and lo mein /fried rice has a good rice-to-veggie ratio. Honey wing sauce is not too sweet and coats the wings well.   Although I can say that I have had better Chinese food, they are quick, convenient, & always satisfy the craving & for that I rock with them!",

I know they are only one of a few places that delivers but use other services such as Postmates or Uber to get better food and service.   -----  Well the food is pretty good for Charlotte, it is my definite go to place in the area. My issue is with the delivery. I've ordered through the Yelp app and also via phone. Each time it's the same thing. I give detailed directions to press a number on the call box and come up to the right floor/apt and that I don't get cell service on my phone in my place. Each time they call my phone off the hook and I end up having to go down there.   My other issue is I ask for extra duck sauce each time and each time I get 2 packets. I know it sounds ridiculous but when you order $20 and $30 worth of food the least they can do is throw a few more in there.   In the end I would say definitely go to the location for a great time but do not order delivery.",

    "text": "Is it the best? No way. Is it the worst? Heck no. I think A-OK is a spot on description of the Cherry House.  Most important thing: you can place orders online. I really hate to order over the phone, so this is a big win for me. They also deliver.  This place is just a few blocks from my house, so it's a super convenient location for me. I usually just grab some take out, but I finally had my first dine in experience Sunday night.  Starving after watching the Denver-Oakland shellacking, we voted on Chinese and decided to head here. I always get soup and one of the combinations. This go round I went Hot & Sour Soup and Sha Cha Shrimp combo with brown rice and an egg roll. Huge portions. My roommate doesn't like this place, but when I brought the leftovers home... she was a big fan. She was shocked when I told her it was from Cherry House. Maybe she's just been ordering wrong?   My other friend always goes curry when she does Chinese. She ordered the Curry Chicken combination here and didn't like it. I'm not the biggest curry fan, so I'll let her be the judge on that one.  For me, spicy mustard is a must for egg rolls. I got a side and whoa did it pack a punch. I loved it, but it may be too spicy for some so be warned. Soda is by the can, so if you down your drink... you'll have to buy another one. If you're getting take out and do need a soda (one larger than a can), there is a Friendly Mart across the street.  There are better places around, but this hits the spot if you live in the Elizabeth area.",

We would have cancelled the order, but we had already given them our credit card number. There was no manager on duty and not ONE SINGLE WORD of APOLOGY! This is not the first problem we have had with their delivery service, but we have always given them the benefit of the doubt, even the time our order was totally wrong! No more.........",

You won't find some random sauce that is used in every dish here. The menu has a few more health conscious options you won't find at many others, which is nice for the days I feel like lying to myself about dieting.

Decided to go, as my dad was craving. Ho Ho is clearly more of a takeout place but has a full restaurant with seating. Walked to the counter to get our menu then seated ourselves.   We both ordered the all day special #W5 which was 6 chicken wings and shrimp fried rice. Large amount of food for the price of $8.20.   Our order arrived quickly but was not very hot. My chicken wings were a tad dry but I really enjoyed my shrimp fried rice. I would honestly say some of the best that I have had in the area.   I'm hoping to return again and provide an updated review with a different protein option. If it is tasty, I'd upgrade to 4 starts.",

Today unfortunately, since I've been not eating meat I've been ordering things that don't have meat on it obviously. I ordered vegetable spring rolls but when I went to eat it and it was basically an egg roll with pork in it.

I have, however, recently discovered the shrimp lo mein here at Ho Ho, and I think it's pretty delicious.  I also enjoy the spring rolls.  Again, I have very little means of comparison and I've only started to venture into Chinese cuisine recently.  The parking lot here is shared with the rest of the businesses in the strip center, and is pretty heavily trafficked.  Most of the businesses in the shopping center are fairly popular, and some even have their own spaces designated, making parking even more of a challenge.  The upside is that most of the spaces turn relatively quickly, as none of the businesses are the type to have customers/clients that loiter for longer periods of time.  The restaurant itself delivers, but also has a small dining area inside.  They have added mirrors to provide the illusion of a larger space, but it is honestly a bit dizzying to me.  Call ahead orders are the best way to go, but they will also take walk-in orders.  If you find yourself having to wait for your order, there is a Starbucks just across the street where you can grab a beverage to pass the time.  The space is older, but I think it's fairly clean.  I like that they are open when most other paces aren't, such as Christmas, which is typical of most Chinese restaurants.  I honestly think they are pretty average and it's certainly not horrible.  If you want some Chinese, give it a go.",

I called to check on my order before the delivery arrived and the women I spoke with was very rude, she had a serious attitude with me.   NOW ON TO THE BIG ISSUE: I have a severe peanut and treenut allergy. I ordered Chicken LoMein and noted my allergy in the comment box. When I got my dinner I took 3 bites and I could already feel an allergic reaction!! If you can't accommodate an allergy then you should have called an informed me! My allergy is a life or death situation for me, I am prone to anaphylactic reactions!

I got the vegetable lo mein and the veggies were still crunchy which I hate. The other thing I got was the chicken and broccoli which was even worse than the lo mein. Rice was undercooked and so was the broccoli. There was barely any sauce in the dish and the small amount that was there was flavorless. I took about 3 bites and dumped it in the trash. Don't waste your time or money coming here.",

I put them in the toaster oven and dabbed off some grease and they were a lot less gross.   The general tso's chicken was ok, but dry and kind of clumpy.

I had anticipated it would be counter service so I was glad to know it was table service since I was not in a hurry to be anywhere.   I started with the Egg Drop Soup.  It was very good.  It was the right texture and not overly salty like some places.   My entree was Shrimp Mei Fun.  I love rice noodles, but I don't think I've ever had this dish anywhere.  It was a generous portion of rice noodles with bits of scrambled egg and shrimp.  Not really a sauce so that was a plus in my book.  The noodles were cooked just right.  The shrimp maybe could have been cooked 30 seconds less, but still good.  The service was very attentive, but there was only 1 other table.  It will definitely be on my list for when I want table service Chinese.  Not sure if it's worth the drive to Elizabeth when there are other Chinese restaurants near me, but good.",

Can't be worse than what happened to Hong Kong Chinese (read my previous review for that story). When I first walked in I was surprised by the cleanliness, and how well put together the interior looked, nicely decorated without going over the top.  My wife and I were greeted at the counter and took a minute to look over the menu. I went with one of their \"house specials\" the spicy tangerine chicken, ordered with white rice, and an egg roll for $7. Not bad at all. The wife went with good ol' beef lo-mein.  Everything was really good, seemed fresh, and had great flavor. This is slowly becoming one of my fav take out Chinese places around. Ho Ho Cherry House has my vote!",

All I can say is Holy crap! I've been ordering from the wrong place entirely. Cherry house has stale meats, floating in awful, thick, flavorless brown goo. The spring rolls taste like they were frozen twice, and even the fortune cookies were rubbery. This place is just terrible. Thank goodness I'm recovering from the flu and didn't feel like going out. I never would have discovered what I've been missing all these years. This is not good food, even for takeout. You'd be far better off going to the grocery store and buying the store brand 'beef with broccoli' and some frozen egg rolls. At least they wouldn't be slathered in sauce that prisoners wouldn't eat.",

We went here on my roommate's request. He had the Chicken and Broccoli (He ALWAYS has the chicken and broccoli!) and seemed to enjoy. We split an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty decent too. It wasn't exactly complex in flavor, but it's tough to screw up crab and cream cheese deep fried in wontons. I had a General Tso's combination and I can best describe my impression as underwhelmed. The chicken was a little to crunchy/chewy for my taste and the sauce was not as spicy as a like my general tso's but I suppose these are both excusable if they happen to be your taste.   What was not excusable, and really what is prompting me to write this review, was the egg roll. The only reason I was craving Chinese so badly was because I wanted an egg roll. You know how boiled cabbage can be kind of odiferous? Well imagine a wonton wrapper which contained nothing (no egg, no pork, no nothing) but cabbage that smelled, not mildly, of parade route (anyone who has ever marched behind mounted cavalry knows what I mean). I was very disappointed.  It should be said that the service was good and, as I said before, I have only eaten here once. You can pay your money and take your chances on the fact that I was there on an off night or that they will be more to your liking. I will be getting my Chinese food elsewhere.",

On a recent visit to pick up our order, I happened to notice there was a coupon in their to go menu I had picked up.  The coupon was spend 15, get 5 off. I asked the MANAGER, \"hey, can we please use this coupon?\"  The manager said, \"did you just pick that up off my counter?\" Playfully I said, \"umm, noooo\" thinking there was no way he was going to deny us the coupon.. (remember, talking to the manager, not a teenager in the front.)  He then proceeded to tell us that no we couldn't use the coupon, and we would have to take the coupon home, cut it, and use it on our next visit.   I said I couldn't believe that, and that if there was some sort of parameter of that sense it should be clearly stated on the to-go menu. When he finally refused, I said under my breath, \"guess we'll be going down the street to 88 Bistro.\" to which he had the nerve to reply, \"yeah, I heard that place is great, have you been?\" What a jackass. If directly disrespecting your customers is how you run your business, then I will be happy to support your competitor.",

    "text": "I have never written a restaurant review. I had to this time. I was shocked & grossed out by my service and food at Ho Ho Cherry House. I had never been in before, walked in to a dark restaurant. Ordered beef & broccoli lunch. Sat down to wait/eat. The booth I sat in STUNK. Like Body odor... Or something funky. I couldn't figure it out. They never asked if I wanted to go (I didn't) but brought it to me in a paper bag. There was no utensils in the bag. When I started eating out of my styrofoam container, in my stinky booth, I had to laugh at how awful this experience was. And then I found a hair laying on the inside of the styrofoam container near the food... It could have been mine, and wasn't touching the food so I removed it & moved on. Started eating and it just didn't taste good. The broccoli was off, the beef chewy & just in general wasn't tasty. I had to add a pack of soy sauce to the dish just to mask how bad the flavor was.",

It's a great value at $6 total after tax.  This it's the best Chinese, but I've never been disappointed.  They even allowed me to substitute red for green peppers the last time I ordered the special, cool!  It's the perfect \"neighborhood Chinese takeout/delivery\" place.",

    "text": "I get Chinese maybe twice a year. So unlike most, I don't have a go to spot. The reviews for the two places closest to me weren't so great, so I took yelps advice and we ordered (thru the Eat24 app) from Cherry House. We got steamed dumplings, beef with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken for the kids and a wonton soup. Ordering was a breeze. Price was nothing to complain about either. Service was friendly. Food was pleasant enough for Chinese. I definitely can't complain. It was all recognizable :) but the dumplings,.,they were delicious, the sauce that accompanies them...to die for. I'm pretty sure we just established our go to place. There was no shortage of condiments. Menu was plentiful and affordable. 4 of us ate off of what we ordered. Not bad.",

The chicken egg roll wasn't very good and the crab wontons were just filled with cream cheese. The sesame chicken was spot on and the Mongolian beef was the best we ever had. The beef was tender and super flavorful. Only complaint would be too many onions with it. Also got pork lo mein and shrimp fried rice. Both had decent amounts of protein and fresh veggies. This will become our regular Chinese place.",

I'm a fan of their szechuan bean curd. It' great when I need a quick meal.  There are a good bit of seat's inside, though I have never seen them very packed. The interior is as decorated as one would expect, but no matter, your there for the food right?",

It is a very sweet dish, but extremely delicious!",

    "text": "What happened to this place? I ordered my usual extra crispy sesame chicken and mushy yuckyness with  bland yet sweet syrupy sauce is what I received.   I was given no choice between fried rice and white rice and they automatically assumed I wanted the large portion when I actually would have wanted the small if I knew I had the option ( I just thought the prices went up...and truthfully there was no difference in size and it use to be $6.95 now its $10.95!). I have gone to other restaurants and ordered $10 worth of Chinese take-out and received an egg roll and soup too- not the case here...although before it use to be- new management ?..or are they just getting cheap?   The usually amazing   crab rangoon wasn't hot enough (temp-wise) and I was totally disappointed.They also forgot to give me my chop sticks which may be a small thing but I specifically asked for them. The literally gave us a full pint of duck sauce though so perhaps they should think of scaling down there and throwing in a veggie egg roll like they use to.    They use to have 5 stars from me but this last time wasn't even worth a single star in my opinion so  I'll meet somewhere in the middle and give them a 2.5 ...I really am not sure if I would return if the quality has gone that downhill...search is back on for good take-out Americanized Chinese food in Charlotte",
