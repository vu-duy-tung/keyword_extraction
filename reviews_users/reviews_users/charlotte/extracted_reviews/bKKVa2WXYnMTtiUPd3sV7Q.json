    "text": "Wow.   Went in for Sunday Brunch and noticed a terrible sewage rotten eggs smell and tried to move away from the door. Decided to get a table instead of sit a the bar and were told they were on a wait because servers weren't coming in and they didn't want to back the kitchen up.  I kid you not, it was probably 10:15 a.m. and there were maybe, 2 tables in the front that were occupied and about 3 in the back.  They \"just got off of a wait,\" the hostess told us. I was dumbfounded.  You never place blame on your FOH staff like that and say we can't seat you because people haven't shown up. If you need to pull the bartender off of the bar because NO ONE is sitting there, then do so, ask a manager to help, and then attack service as a team which is what you are in the SERVICE industry.  Way to stick up for the BOH but come on, you can walk real slow to the table. You can make conversation about the menu before departing, suggest dishes, ask if we've been before, etc. All of these things add time, give your staff a little breather, and then you move on.  Really disappointed.  Ended up not staying because of the disgusting smell because we couldn't take it and, we couldn't sit anywhere else.",

Bar was packed so grabbed a drink and headed outside to the side alley to wait. When we got in service was decent and the food was very good.",

I highly recommend the frozen Cadillac margarita which of course comes with a shot of Grand Marnier up top .. the chips & salsa are always on point and the entrees are simply delicious. If you haven't been to Superica you owe it to yourself to drop in for the friendly atmosphere & an overall great experience! Absolutely no shame in their game at this vibrant dining establishment. Cheers!",

But what in the world is going on with the management here? We have been to Superica eight times, and each time there have been no less than twenty open tables, but still a wait. And the kitchen is constantly backed up. It always takes us at least 45 minutes to get our food. I could understand if they just opened, but Superica has been open for 7 months. Come on guys! Figure it out. Our opinion is not an anomaly, either. Everyone we talk to has the same sentiments. It's a real shame because the food is great, and I can tell the employees work hard.   We won't be visiting any time soon after our experience this morning (we spent 2 hours as a party of 2 at the restaurant due to the kitchen being backed up again). I hope some changes are made so we can try it again in the future.",

I had some great Salsa here, Queso, Tacos, Tamale. The fare isn't the typical menu that you see in almost all mexican restaurants, but more upscale. Pricier also, but if you want a nice Mexican dinner and something a little different, this is your place. It has a hopping popular vibe, a great bar, great food, a cool interior in an old refurbished building. And you can find excellent parking right across the street.",

The place is large, bright and airy with two dining areas, one with a view of the kitchen. There is also a large bar and a sofa if you're chilling after your meal.  You'll be greeted with the house chips and two salsas; they give you a green salsa and roasted salsa and both are delicious and packed with flavor.  Try the nachos, chicken or beef, they are a must and are not what your expecting. The flautas appetizer is my favorite.   Every time I've been Charlie has been behind the bar and the service has been amazing.   It's just a good place to visit.",

The service was excellent once we tracked down a waiter (this is where it was apparent that they're new :) ) . . . The atmosphere is fun and light and open.  I ordered the OG margarita, and be warned - it's small but strong! We also opted for the queso fundido after reading reviews which was good, but I wish I would've gone with my gut and ordered guac. The queso was delicious but hard to eat since it's so thick.  I ordered the camaron tacos which were flavorful but a bit on the salty side. I would definitely come back!",

It just had a few pieces of pork, very dissappointing. Guess they forgot to fill that one, oh well. We also ordered a chicken fajita which was real good but only had onions and the tortillas that came with it were totally dried out. However, the enchiladas entree was prepared well. They give you unlimited rice and beans to share but they put it in really small plates which is barely enough for 2. In addition, the entree plates are so small you need to ask for extra plates just to hold the rice and beans. The service was excellent. Was getting really crowded at 630 so expect a wait on sat nites. We got in at 530 and were seated right away. Not sure if I'll go back.",

I got a crispy shrimp taco and a vegetable enchilada (our waitress let me get them a la carte as i couldn't decide between the two) and both were super tasty. My friend got chicken enchiladas and said they were the best she has had. I got plantains for desert and they were good but could have used a little more of the sauce they drizzle on top.

The food was over priced for such a small amount that honestly didn't even taste good. The food was bland and over cooked. I was no impressed. I was excited for a place to eat near my home, but was soon mistaken for an over priced crap taco place.",

    "text": "I would give it 10 Stars if I could. Easily my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I've been here 5 times since it opened and every time has been well worth the wait. Everything from the food to the drinks to the service to the vibes is on point.   The homemade tortilla chips with red and green salsas the second you sit down is great. The queso fundido with chorizo as an appetizer is an absolute must. They serve it with freshly made warm flour tortillas to make mini quesadilla wraps. The flavor is out of this world, to the point where it's almost indescribable. I've had the chicken and steak fajitas, brisket tacos, and beef enchiladas for dinner. All were amazing, but the fajitas were my favorite.   They have an outdoor seating area that they are not serving at yet. However, you can sit out there and enjoy some chips and salsa and margaritas as you wait for your table. Once they start seating and serving out there, this place will be even better.   I'd also like to call out the incredible service we have had there each time.  The main server is always cool, friendly, and on top of their game. It seems like they always have several backup servers as well that frequently stop by the table to clear plates, refill chips, salsa and margaritas, and make sure everything is all good.   Overall, as you can tell, I can't say enough positive things about this Atlanta based Tex Mex joint. The place is always packed and rightfully so. Every time we have visitors in town, we bring them here and they echo our reviews.",

The food is so fresh, flavorful, it borders on extravagant for lunch, nearly too elegant for simply being labeled Tex-Mex! But, it's just that they do it SO WELL, each little bit.The freshly roasted tomatillo salsa, the creamy avocado-cilantro salsa, the beans and rice brought out family style for the table (sufficient for just a few people at lunch!). The decor is artsy without being in your face. It's just tasty and tastefully done. The service- FANTASTIC! EVERY PERSON THERE was so pleasant, truly must love working there, and believe in the place. Seriously, this is a hidden gem, and it gets packed quickly. Mind you, I see that said in the other reviews as well, so I had thought maybe it was a small place. Noooooo, no no no. IT IS HUGE IN SIDE! And yet, at lunch, I think EVERY table was full, and the seats at the bar will filling up quickly! I did eye a special spot in front of the frozen margarita machine that looked promising for my next visit. Very attractive place, beautiful food, nice people. Don't quibble about the cost, it's worth it. Treat yourself!",

    "text": "Calling all people who came from Texas, New Mexico or Arizona!  I have a major announcement.  When someone asks you \"where can I go to get good Tex Mex in Charlotte?\", you will no longer have to tell them to \"go to the airport...where you can catch the next flight out to the South/Southwest\".  Instead, you can drive on over to Superica to get your fix.  Let's discuss...  First off, the dishes have a slightly modern flare to them, but the authentic flavors are there.  I happened to enjoy the smoky salsa, while my boyfriend enjoyed the mild avocado based salsa.  They keep a stash behind the bar, so if you have a long wait, just ask for a basket and they will give it to you for free.  Next we got the Tampaquena and the Picadilla enchilada.  The entree comes with unlimited rice/beans.  Rice flavors were very authentic.  I had to try the puffy queso taco.  Totally not a traditional Tex-Mex dish, but it looked so funny that I had to try it.  Corn masa was made from scratch and on point.  Queso was super yummy.  Second, the place is huge and the decor certainly has a southwest feel to it.  Pictures and deer/horse sculls make you feel like you're in one big Georgia O'Keeffe painting, just more updated.  Third, don't skip the drinks.  They have a nice selection to choose from, and right now, their huge back patio is just for overflow waiting.  Until they get the back area organized for table service, grab some drinks and chips and relax with some friends while you wait for your table.  The real test of success or failure will be on their fajitas and Carne Guisada.  I'm excited and skeptical all at the same time, and I'll absolutely be back to give it try!",

The following weekend my husband and I were in the area running errands and were needing a good brunch (who doesn't need a good brunch..?!). So he looks online and says \"hey Superica actually serves brunch starting at 10, let's go there!\" no mistake there!!   At 10:06 am we were the only people in the restaurant (for a while- it picked up by the time we left). We were promptly served two salsas and they were each explained to us (one spicier, one smokier- both made in house). The waitress also informed us that while it was time for brunch, the entire menu was available as well.   We ended up getting queso with chorizo and splitting the steak and eggs. We both loved them!! The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare), the eggs were wonderfully runny but not under done, and the peppers, onions, Mexican butter, and fixins were perfect. They even brought out a third salsa which complemented the breakfast expertly.  I'm the kind of customer that will enjoy a meal experience more if service is attentive and the decor is appropriate. Superica should know that both service and the restaurant as a whole were excellent. The decorations hit Tex-Mex spot on and they committed to the theme all the way throughout the space, including bathrooms. My husband and I both chatted with two waitresses who, even at 10 am, were bright and happy and had no problem carrying a conversation with us.   So 5/5 stars for food, decor, service. We will definitely be back!",

My server Mary was a pleasure and very knowledgeable. Her service was 5/5.   The menu is quite extensive and some items are very Tex mex while other would appear to be authentic. I ordered a ceviche which had aguachile in it. Agua Chile is an authentic ceviche style dish with pickled onions, cucumber and lime cured shrimp in a spicy lime juice. Their version of that was horrible. I didn't eat 1/3 of it. I also ordered queso fundido as an app. The queso fundido was quite good and I like that it came with tortillas in True Mexican style fashion.   For drinks I thought it was cool they carried authentic glass bottled \"squirt.\" That stuff is good. I also ordered the OG margarita which was disgusting to me. It was a plain lime juice tequila and a lil agave. It was stern. Maybe I am a sissy / cuck but I prefer margs to be a tad sweeter.   What was also disappointing was how long the drinks take to get made. I waited an easy 10 minutes for each drink.   If not for the service this would have been a 2/5 max. The food is largely overrated but the establishment is in a prime location and I guess people like pseudo authentic Mexican and Tex mex!",

Service was excellent! The place was comfortably full and starting to get their lunch rush in. The chips and salsa they give out are amazing! Definitely not your typical \"Mexican\" restaurant chips and salsa- the chips are airier and perfectly crunchy, paired well with the creamy avocado salsa or the other pepper salsa (can't remember what's in it but it's good!). I ordered the salad and the taco al carbon, which comes with rice and beans for their lunch special of $11.99. Such a huge portion! I definitely took half home. The salad is well dressed and perfect for the hot weather. I would have been fine with just the salad- that's how large the portion was. But let me tell you about the rice- it was to DIE for!! The best rice and beans I've ever had hands down! The taco al carbon wasn't what I expected it to be like but it tasted really good as well.",

    "text": "I wasn't exactly stunned by Superica. Their vegetarian options are definitely limited, which is always a bummer. The only hearty options are the fajitas or enchiladas - the tacos are a joke (lettuce, tomato, cheese, and guacamole). And the cost is just nuts - $20 for fajitas! You could get cheaper food in NYC. That's just ridiculous.   The restaurant itself is aesthetically pleasing and the venue is pretty expansive. Since it's still a new spot, the wait can be long, so plan accordingly.  I'm curious to try their house cocktails, guacamole, and pancakes. But, not sure I'll be back considering I really don't find this place to be worth it (or that it fulfills the hype!).",

    "text": "I was torn on whether to leave four or five stars for Superica, as after much consideration, I'd prefer to award it 4.5 stars.  Since Yelp doesn't allow for that, I decided to go with the five.  It's a pretty new, happening restaurant in the rockin' South End area of Charlotte, where it seems like something new is popping up every other week.  Other reviews made me wary of the wait times (two hours?!) but we decided to forge on and try the place.  Charlotte's Mexican food scene is rather weak in my opinion, so we decided to tough out the 45-60 minute wait time we were given.  Fortunately, some other folks must have decided that the wait was longer than they were willing to bear, so we were seated after only about 30 minutes.  We were given freshly fried tortilla chips and two different salsas to try, one of which was a slightly smoky green salsa, the other a creamier, mild one made with avocado.  Both were tasty, and neither was terribly spicy.  We ordered chili con queso to start, and it was delicious.  The chili was more or less invisible, but overall it was tangy and delicious like good queso should be.  The few ribbons of cilantro sprinkled on the top were welcome and a nice bright herbal foil to the richness of the cheese.  For my entree I ordered tampiquena, a marinated grilled skirt steak served with cheese enchiladas and a fried egg.  The steak was expertly grilled to a medium rare and came with some sort of compound butter that while not advertised on the menu, was rich and delicious after melting all over the steak.  The fried egg had a perfectly runny yolk with crispy lacy whites, and the cheese enchiladas were delicious.  They were made with corn tortillas bursting with corn flavor, which I appreciated.  My wife ordered the veggie fajitas, and I was impressed that the server asked if she was a vegetarian, as the refried beans the entrees are served with are cooked in pork stock, and the rice is cooked in chicken stock.  She's not a vegetarian so it was fine, but good on them for asking.  Her entree was absolutely beautiful, with nicely charred cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, radishes, corn, sweet potato, and poblano peppers.  Everything about the preparation of our meal was well-executed.  The main issue was the service time.  We're leisurely diners but it took 90 minutes from start to finish, and it's not because we were loafing.  Several managers came by to apologize for the wait for our entrees.  In the end, they did us right by comping our entrees as well as one of my drinks, and they did so without a single complaint from us and without solicitation.  I get they're new and want to make a good impression to ensure repeat business, and they did exactly the right thing during our visit.  Our server, Raul, was excellent and had some great suggestions for our meal, so we made sure to take care of him when paying the bill.  The pacing would have knocked off a half-star, but since they made it right and were very conscientious our whole meal, they earned five stars and our repeat business.",

It consists of their frozen margarita with a shot of Grand Marnier on top .. sure it costs a little more but it's money well spent! Let me just say I needed a cigarette after my first Lambo and I don't even smoke ha!  As good as the drinks are .. the food is even better! The staff is very knowledgeable about every option on the menu. Feel free to ask questions .. I'm pretty confident they will have all the answers including ones concerning any issues with food allergies.  This Tex-Mex establishment deserves more than 5 Stars based on my experiences there. You owe it to yourself to give it a try.",

No green peppers in my fajita.   Hot drop something drink? -- cool; it's cava and one slice of cucumber. Not worth $11.  And topping on the cake was that my $30 shrimp fajitas-- I HAD TO PEEL MY OWN TAILS OFF AND THEY WERE SOOOOO DRY- way over cooked!

    "text": "Holy Mole, this place was great! I don't know what I was expecting, but I think I stayed away from Superica because I thought it was going to be pretentious? I was wrong, I'll admit it. It takes a lot for me to admit that, but I was.   We arrived at Superica on a Sunday night, pretty early. Easy to find and lots of street parking around the corner, we walked in and were greeted with... a family environment? Huh? Yes, Yelp readers, Superica is host to a fantastic Sunday night meal with the grandparents *and* grandchildren. We were seated quickly (Superica does not take reservations) and tended to quickly.   The menu is small, and relatively sophisticated, but doesn't shy away from mexican/tex mex favorites like quesadillas and tacos. We were served with chips and salsa, both of which were freshly made. There were two types of Salsa, neither of which were really spicy, but both of which were intensely flavorful. And best of all, it's free. Free refills too!  For the main course, I ordered enchiladas, which come with two. Anytime I see Mole on a menu, I'm intrigued, because good mole takes a LOT to make. It takes ingredients, and time. And I kind of use it as a test. I ended up ordering one Mole and one Chicken Suizas, just in case the mole didn't work out.   It did. Wonderful mole they've got here - not super sweet and has a great smoky, peppery, roasty back flavor. Very complex, very very well done. Bravo, guys. The manager even came over at the end of the meal to chat with us and alongside helping The Lady pack up her leftovers, he actually brought us more chips and salsa that he had pre-packaged up for us. Talk about service!   Between the service and the quality of the food here, Superica is definitely a place I'll recommend to anybody! I didn't even think the prices were horrendous (yes, it was more expensive than you usually pay, but not outrageously so!). Go see for yourselves :)",

We also received complimentary fresh chips and 2 salsas. I lovedddddd the avocado salsa and she like the fire roasted salsa because it had a kick. Although the wait was a little longer than expected, it was well worth the wait. I even had enough for leftovers. Lil Kim was our waitress and she was awesome.

    "text": "Super sad to write this review. I've been to Superica a few times in the past and have always RAVED about their food to everyone and anyone that will listen which is why I'm still giving 3 stars. Tonight though, I ordered carry out and was super disappointed- if this had been my first experience, two stars would've felt generous. I ordered two orders of tortilla soup at $9 each. Pretty pricey for soup that fit in one bowl, but figured it would be worth it. It was SO salty that neither me or my boyfriend could even finish it, and I am a huge salt person. We also ordered the Tacos Al Carbon because we always get these when we go in person. Unfortunately they were VERY skimpy on the steak compared with our past experiences- maybe that's just because it was take out, but the soup really was unbelievably salty. Was definitely not worth even close to the money we paid for dinner.",

She was coughing into everything....her hands, the register, glasses all while refilling water cups, handing out silverware and making drinks.  It was absolutely disgusting and unsanitary.  She claimed it was allergies.  She should have been adult enough to remove herself from the job and the manager should have paid better attention.  This was my second visit here...food is good, but not outstanding as some other reviews have stated. Only reason I'm giving two stars is for the house made salsa and for the other bartender who we had for the second time.  He offers great customer service.",

    "text": "Just underwhelming.  Kitchen needs some retaining and someone overseeing and correcting mistakes as they come out of the kitchen.  The send back to fix process is annoying as hell and hard on servers.  The good: Atmosphere Service was friendly Mostly tasty flavors in the food  The bad: Parking Lukewarm hostess Server was too busy to do a GREAT job Management on floor, visible but not helping Kitchen not paying attention to food going out Portion size Price for portion Slow kitchen  I ordered the flautas, there were literally two.  They were oily as hell and the kitchen forgot my guacamole.  Our server was hustling and by the time I got my guacamole, my two pitiful $13 flautas were cold (and still oily.)  My husband ordered tamale and eggs with a side of beans.  He got the worst plated dish I saw the entire time I sat there (over 40 mins waiting for food.). It looked like a Jimmy Dean version of a tamale.  Half empty, hard, melted soggy cheese on top in a plate swimming with refried beans.  They forgot his eggs.  He ate it because by then he was starving and he too had to wait until our server got his eggs.  His breakfast was supposed to come with fresh tortillas, he never got a single tortilla.  The menu says no charge for refried beans, we were charged $3.  We paid it and left, but it's another \"wtf??\"  Just....messy.  Not pulled together.  Not focused on making sure the plate is right, looks yummy.  Then the server should be checking it before she brings it out, she knows TAMALE AND EGGS HAS EGGS! Instead of letting us find the issues, the people being paid to work should be looking to fix and never let us see there was a problem.  The table behind us ordered one order of fajitas to share and waited over 30 mins, they must have asked our server three times if their food was coming.  It's not servers fault, it's kitchen and management fault.  We won't be back.",

They were so packed and there is not a waiting area so we sat outside on the steps. Good thing the weather cooperated that day or I would have went home. Got to the table there are a couple of salsa they put down. One is avocado based. Which I really enjoyed. The second was spicy. I didn't taste that one as I don't like spicy food but my friends enjoyed it. We had about 3 servings each. We also order the queso fundido and when I tell you this is a must have. It was good. I should have stopped there. But I didn't. I ordered chicken fajita and was disappointed. The chicken was flavorless and was a little soft. I didn't finish it. I gave the rest to my boyfriend at home who eats anything and he wasn't impressed. needless to say the almost 2 hour wait for weak drinks, good cheese and flavorless chicken. I heard their brunch was good so I may give that a try.",

    "text": "What was my biggest take away after my first trip to Superica? I'm just gonna come out and say it but this place is clearly Mexican food for white people...I mean just look around the packed restaurant at at the patrons at 6:30pm on a Friday and its very obvious that this is where the squares (I'm bringing that word back from the crypt in this case) of Charlotte go to get their international cuisine fix. Its basically the sit down full serve answer to Chipotle. But at least here the chips and salsa are complimentary (and really good). The chips you might seem familiar if you ever got the chips and salsa from Chili's super thin and super crispy. The two salsas, an avocado (tomatillo) salsa verde and a roasted tomato salsa, will leave you feeling little need for a starter of guac. We ordered the whole fried snapper to share which came with unlimited refried beans and rice. The snapper, which was presented beautifully didn't quite deliver on taste. My friend and I agreed, almost simultaneously as we took the first bite, that it was very fishy tasting, especially for a snapper and it was underseasoned. The salsa verde they had it laying in had taken away most of the crispiness of the top half of the fish and sogged up the bottom half. The salsa was a bit of a throwaway for me, didn't offer much aside from wetness and when put up next to the ones served with the chips, the one on the fish didn't stand a chance. The tortillas served with the fish however were great and homemade, the beans were delicious too, but melt a bunch of cheese on top of anything and it will be delish, the rice totally forgettable. Want a good whole fried fish, get the one off the authentic menu at Azteca. We also got some frozen margaritas which were excellent, not very sweet with housemade mix, just as it should be. The service was a high point, friendly while not being overbearing. Bottom line is I doubt I would come back here for the food cuz as good as the service was, if the food isn't great what is the point? I MIGHT come back for the drinks and chips if I find myself in the area. Thing is, I PERSONALLY see no reason for a place like this when I can get better versions of nearly everything on the menu at a better price at a local or family owned joint. But then again I don't think I'm the kind of person this spot is really catering to..",

We all are very chill people and rarely ever complain - all of us have been servers so we are more than understanding of the position but this was beyond unacceptable. The drinks took 20 minutes per round at times, we had empty drinks pretty much the entire time, it took almost 2 hours to get our food and a couple peoples order was wrong. I could maybe give some leeway if the restaurant was slammed but it was a Wednesday and it was at half capacity. The manager took over the table and the server was very apologetic so that made up for it but it was pretty disappointing especially since it was someone's birthday dinner. I will be returning because of the food so I am hoping this is a one off...",

Dishes came out hot and exactly how we ordered them. Bonus was we had the best waitress. I think her name was Katelyn (Caitlyn)?  Did not get spelling of her name but was told by one of the hosts that she was brand new.  She was amazing and made dinner even better.  Patiently went through all our questions regarding drinks and description of food options.  In addition she was funny, and knowledgeable and clearly loves her job. If the manager reads this, give that girl a raise. She is a keeper...rare if ever that I'm happy with waitstaff.  Just ask my husband.  Anyway...thanks for a fun evening that included yummy food and great drinks!",

One was toasted tomatillos and the other a creamy cool avocado  salsa. Chips always make or break a Mexican place for me and this we're perfectly cooked, light and then with the perfect amount of salt.  The lunch menu has plenty of options and some make a combo choices. Everything came out hot and the rice and beans were served family style.   5 stars and just need them to open a spot in Bally",

    "text": "Does Superica live up to the hype? In my experience, I say yes. Sometimes Charlotte goes ape-shit over mediocre places, so I walked in really not expecting to be writing a 5 star review right now. I have to admit, I was pretty impressed.   My friend and I came in for lunch on Saturday. We went before noon because we weren't sure just how busy it would be. The smiling hostess sat us immediately. Chips and two housemade salsas were delivered to the table. One was a smoky red sauce, the other a green avocado sauce. I thought both were great. I kept going back and forth on which one was my favorite.   We started with queso fundido (added chorizo) and michaladas (beer, tomato, and lime juice). I'm from Nebraska, so I'm a huge red beer fan.  And of course, I had to do the infamous cheese pull. We ordered Picadillo enchiladas and chicken suiza enchiladas. We opted to add a puffy queso chicken tinga taco for $4. I thought everything was delicious. I like that they do the beans and rice family style and it's bottomless. I thought everything was delicious. I loved the chili gravy on the picadillo enchiladas. The side of green sauce that came with the puffy taco was amazing. I would put that on everything (different than the salsa).   Note: they have an $11.99 lunch special menu Monday-Friday, you pick two items (nachos, enchilada, hard shell taco, salad, soup, taco al carbon).  The space is beautiful. I didn't really realize how large it was (TWSS). Our server was training and we were only his 2nd table. So, shout out to Caleb. I thought he did a terrific job. People keep asking about parking, drive around and look for street spots. There's also a paid lot across the street.   Superica, welcome to Charlotte. I'll definitely be putting you in my eating rotation.",

Their unlimited twice refried beans were delicious as well. It was great up until 6 months ago when the menu began changing. The Fajita sides changed. Unlimited beans and rice ended. Pricing increased as food quality declined.   We went for brunch on 1/27 and had a disappointing experience. The tamale recipe changed, our meals arrived cold and service was slow. The server did a good job handling the situation though.  It's a good place to try for new people. Foodie regulars... it has changed. The chips and salsas are still delicious though!",

Seems like a legit reason to turn away business when there aren't any rain clouds in the vicinity. Will go where business appreciate their customers from now on.

I think the place is more focused on appearance from a food perspective than taste. I order the brisket  street style tacos and cheese dip for the appetizer.   Everything in the meal looked nice but I it was lacking something that I couldn't put my finger on but I realized the better Mexican places marinate their meats longer. The meat (brisket) was just good not great.   The atmosphere is the nicest thing here. I would definitely go back for the cheese dip alone but the prices seem a little steep for the quality. I would choose Cantina 1511 over this place based on price point.   This place is definitely worth a try though. Happy eating!",

Elevated Tex Mex is hard to come by and Superica delivers with delicious salsas, great margaritas, and tender, juicy fajita dishes. The tortillas are warm and soft and pair great with any dish on the menu.  The brunch is under-the-radar as well with chorizo and egg dishes and a giant pancake on the menu. It's extremely filling so don't plan for anything active right after but it's a great change of pace compared to any other brunch cuisine in Charlotte!  The only negatives here are that the food can be extremely salty at times to the point that the chips are inedible and we've also found that the margaritas sometimes fall well short of being filled to the top of the glass.",

We came here for dinner with another couple and were not disappointed! There was a 45 minute wait (to be expected for a Saturday night around 7) but they were very organized when it came to gathering our information and texting us when our table was about ready. We grabbed margaritas at the front bar and headed to the side patio while we waited. My skinny, spicy margarita was delicious and our friends enjoyed their classic margaritas as well.   Once seated, we were quickly greeted by our server and another employee who dropped off chips and described the two house salsas to us (both delicious!). We ordered guacamole and traditional queso to start and both were great. Various entrees were ordered by the table but the beef and shrimp tacos really stood out. Very well done and solid portions for the price. I also love that they serve rice and beans family style for the table.   Great atmosphere, food and drinks. The patio will be awesome once the weather cools down a bit too! Can't wait to come back!",

Based on the server's recommendation we had the queso with three--guacamole, chorizo, and pico. Everyone loved it!! It was the perfect mix of savory and creamy goodness!   (I want to return for the queso fundido extra cheese pull next time.)  They had good beer selection and good margaritas too!  I liked my entree--the puffy tacos. They are unusual texture and kind of awkward to eat but very flavorful. I had the sampler of tacos( ya get three)--chicken morita, beef and veggies. They are small but filling. I think they're a great quality, the chicken was my favorite.  My husband liked the tacos al pastor and said they're awesome. Our friends liked the fajitas for one and the enchiladas suizas entrees too. We also tried the tres leches cake and it was delicious! It was creamy and sweet!  The pay parking lot across the street was our parking spot. It's $5.  They have a big crowd at dinner so we went early around 5:45 pm on a Saturday to beat the wait. I'm glad we tried the queso and I want to try another visit.",

I ordered off of the regular menu instead of the brunch menu which I wish I hadn't. Should have ventured out for something unique. I ended up getting the El Pastor tacos which were pretty good.

Service was prompt (not our servers fault the drinks took so long) and the ambience is great, was just hoping for better food. The 1/3 of a sausage link for $5 was the highlight.

Street parking only and it's metered from 9-5PM I think there is a pay-lot next to it, but like I said, I walk, so not so sure.  Atmosphere: Nice, laid back design, they have a bar and different styles of seating (tables, banquettes/booth style) So ideal for small or large parties. Music isn't too loud, you can have a conversation across the table without shouting. They play some weird nature videos / slides from a projector on a screen - funky and goes well with the tex-mex eclectic vibe of the place.  Food: I still have to try this place for dinner and brunch. BRUNCH! the menu looks amazing!!!! Micheladas calling my name. But I always come here for lunch at work. So during peak lunch hours! Service and wait have always been quick and on-point.  The table gets free chips and 2 styles of salsa, spicy tomato and a refreshing avocado/cilantro one. I always mix them together. They do taste delicious separately. too   Best deal is the lunch menu, and you may think the items are small, they fill you up. You get to pick two items and it comes with a family style rice and beans to share, but unlimited refills.   So far I have tried on the lunch menu  Hard Shell Taco -Chicken Tinga...taco shell seems fried, it's extra crispy and i like it! Chicken is well seasoned  Enchilada  - Chicken Suizas...sauce and the soft shell mix well with the seasoning of the chicken - Chicken Verde...creamy sauce and different seasoning on this chicken then the suizas, I LIKE THIS ONE BEST!  Taco Al Carbon - Pork Carnitas...delicious marinated pork belly...MY GO TO HERE! - Steak...done medium, juicy flavors  Soup (portion is larger than your average cup, the soup itself fills me up!) - Tortilla Soup...delicious that brings me back to being in TX - Pozole Verde...love regular pozole, verde is a creamy version of it. Just as good, with pork belly bits in it!  Yes, this tex-mex place is worth the hype. Coworkers and I do the walk perhaps 1-week here in this recent heat wave. It's worth it!",

We always wanted to know what was going on at this place as folks would come in and out with big joker smiles as they left. No disrespect to the amazing staff as they were in perfect harmony moving doing a specific job to keep the food coming out hot fresh and with a smile. The ambiance is busy not too flashy but the food will kick you into next week. Bold rich flavors that remind me of True authentic Mexican flavors from San Diego. Well done our server was spot on even with a full house took excellent care of us. The fire roasted salsa is a winner as you can put that on a stale rotten egg and still be something special. We tried the enchiladas that were full flavored and amazing. The rice is just as dire as the salsa.",

Paid over $60 for 2 basic menu items and 2 margs (2 people).    I'm not even that harsh of a critic but I will not be coming back.  You are better off making your own Mexican at home, or going to Taco Bell (because at least their food tastes good)",

    "text": "Not your average Tex-Mex!  I was so pleasantly surprised by how the hype was on point for this place.  We went on a Friday night, which we thought was a mistake but it turned out great-the wait for 2 people at 7 pm was only about 30-45 minutes, and ended up only being about 20 (though I suspect that wasn't the case for Jeni's, which had a line around the block when we were seated at the restaurant, and even longer when we left).  We ended up walking to a bar while we waited, and the hostess kindly said that they'd hold the table for a reasonable amount of time as long as we responded to the text telling us our table was ready, which was great and surprising for a busy Friday night.    Service was great, our waitress took the time to tell us the favorites, including the drink specials.  Although the Matador is a popular choice, I didn't like it.  The skinny girl marg was better.  At one point I think our waitress accidentally put in an order for chorizo queso for us, but we ate it anyway and it was DELICIOUS.  Along with the 2 salsas they give you, and the house made hot sauce, that was basically a meal in and of itself.  Fajitas Mixtas were also amazing, and the butter sauce that comes with it was the icing on the cake.  Cannot wait to go back and try it again!",

    "text": "I checked out Superica on their opening day, and honestly expected it to be pricy with small portions. I was very wrong! The menu is more expensive than most Mexican restaurants, but it turned out to be a steal for what you get. The extras that come with meals make a $11.99 lunch special more than worth it.  You get chips and two salsas to start out with. They're free! The chips were crispy, fresh, and plentiful. The two salsas were a green tomatillo/avocado (fresh, light, tangy) and a more traditional cantina salsa (with just a little heat). You can turn up the heat to your liking with their addictive house hot sauce.  Lunch specials give you the option of two items for $11.99. Ther are enchiladas, soft and hard tacos, soup, salad, and more to choose from. I opted for a beef enchilada with a brown chili gravy and chicken mole enchilada. Both were divine - a serious step up from your run of the mill Tex Mex, and a decent size too. On top of that, you get bottomless refried beans (which are made with pork, btw) with melted cheese, and rice. If you enjoy it as much as I did, you'll end up mixing the leftover enchilada sauces with the beans and the rice, and using a few chips to scoop! There really isn't any need for the beans and rice to be bottomless if you are eating by yourself, because they are both huge sides served in separate dishes than your entree (they may be shared when eating in groups, but I was by myself).   I will certainly be putting Superica in my regular rotation for lunch. The staff were welcoming, friendly, and attentive. And the service was very fast (in and out in 30 minutes). The food is step above what you'd expect from most Tex-Mex joints, and the servings aren't chintzy - you will leave very full! And this was on opening day, which was impressive!",

Their OG marg was pretty standard but sub par compared to some of our favorite Mexican spots. The Matador was better in flavor, but all around their margs lacked in the strength department. The food and service was excellent. You'll get Tracy if you're lucky. All the host staff and managers we encountered were well trained and friendly but Tracy was our server for the evening and was superb. We tried the queso, guac, chicken verde enchiladas and carnitas tacos and everything was delicious.",

The prices were a little more reasonable and the food was almost great.   The chips and two salsas served gratuitously were really delicious. The chips were thin and crispy. The green salsa had a bit of heat but also that tomatillo tartness balanced with creamy avocado. My table mates enjoyed the chipotle salsa more than I, simply because I'm not a fan of the smokiness of chipotle. But I could tell it was well done.   The HORCHATA was the best I've ever had. I sucked it down too quickly. This should not be missed.   My HUEVOS RANCHEROS (minus the beans to make it vegetarian was adequate. Would've been a bit bland without the green salsa but fortunately could add that. It was technically executed well, though. Just didn't have a ton of flavor on its own.   My mom loved the BBQ BRISKET SANDWICH and kept stuffing herself with it, despite being super full. Sister has had the CHILE RELLENO multiple times and loves it every time.   The plain QUESO was also pretty good. Different than at your standard Mexican restaurant but flavorful and nice.   The interior is gorgeous. Service was ok. A bit slow and drawn out but that was ok. We were enjoying ourselves. The only thing I don't like is how pretentious it feels with the attitudes and pricing. But the food really is pretty good and the ambience is great.",

Leaving the airport we discovered that Supercia was a mere 5 miles away so we set GPS and boom arrive just before the crowds around 4:45.  Dining room is expansive with bar seating up front, a large dining hall and outdoor area.    Not many local beers on tap and actually only a handful of draft beers offered at all, but they seem to more bent on offering custom drinks and have an extensive tequila menu. Wife went with Tommy's margarita while I opted for a bottle of Modelo. Service was on point with fresh chips and 2 great salsa's brought out at seating. Both salsas were kick ass with one being a roasted tomato and the other being a Verde.   For dinner expect to spend some bucks if you opt for a house specialty. We were not starving so we opted for the puffy tacos with chicken ( 3 to an order) and the tamales from the app menu.  Tacos were good but not sure if I would order them again. The tamales are a good start with 3 to a serving and served with a side of mole sauce. Entree's are accompanied by rice and beans served family style. Beans are covered in cheese and rice was tasty with corn nibbles and peppers.  I look forward to bringing friends here as the atmosphere is certainly conducive to larger groups.

My friend ordered a pancake stack and it was literally the biggest pancake i've ever seen. It was 14 inches long and definitely the best pancake we've ever had. My other friend ordered an omelette with beans and cheese and it was tasty! I'm not much of a bean eater but this exceeded my expectations. I will be coming back!",

    "text": "This is really a 3.5 rating, but more of a 3 than 4. After much hype, a group of friends and I decided to give Superica a try. For a group of 10, the wait was 2 HOURS, even when we said we would be fine with 2 tables of 5. To say I was HANGRY is an understatement. Once we were seated, things began looking up. Our waitress, Samantha, was amazing! She constantly tended to us and removed plates, cups and etc. from our table as quickly as possible to ensure we would be comfortable.   We ordered a plethora of appetizers to share including the Guacamole, Queso, Chicken Fajita Nachos and Campechana de Mariscos. I highly recommend the Queso, definitely best Queso I've ever had! I also really love their house made sauces for the complimentary chips. For dinner, I tried the Gulf Red Snapper and the Gulf Shrimp and Snapper Ceviche. LOVED the Gulf Red Snapper and the presentation was amazing! They deep fried a giant red snapper and simmer it under verde sauce and avocado. We devoured the entire fish! Market price was $34 I believe, which I thought was a good value. Sadly, the ceviche was extremely underwhelming. It lacked flavor and the shrimp/Snapper were overpowered by the ingredients in the dish. Strange that it was both overpowering and lacked flavor? While our overall experience was enjoyable, most of the dishes didn't live up to 2 hours worth of expectation. Also, prices are pretty high for a Tex-Mex spot (in my opinion). Not sure I'd come back for that kind of wait time, but was worth the try.    Recommend: 1. Queso 2. Red Snapper  Don't Recommend: 1. Campecchana 2. Ceviche   Heads up - a good amount of the dishes had quite a kick to them. While I love spicy food, I know a lot of people do not. If you're sensitive to spicy food, I would recommend informing your server.",

The wife and I stopped in for what we thought  would be a quick and easy lunch. On top of our server making recommendations that weren't available, our food came out wrong twice. Then were uncharged for the stuff that we thought was standard lol.  What a cluster.   Given the amount of time they got my wife's food right, we had to ask for a to go box so we could get back for work.   I won't say we wouldn't go back here, but it would definitely have to be later down the road once they've worked out the kinks.",

Hubby got a Noda hop drop 12oz for $6 bucks and my Tommy's margarita was $10. My drink was 3 good sips and done! I could of drank 3+! But unfortunately not for $10+.   Hubby and I shared the puffy chicken tacos with endless, yep! I said endless rice & beans. The Refried beans smothered in cheese were amazing. Rice with small chopped vegetables was good as well. Puffy tacos are a must try as they are unlike a soft or a hard shell taco. It's almost a puff pastry filled with taco ingredients fried. It's delicious!! Puff tacos were $14, but after filling up on the fresh salsa and chips, we left plenty on our plates.   Wish I had room for more of the endless rice & beans!  Will be back for food, drinks are NOT justifiably but food was worth it!!",

    "text": "I had been given a heads up by friends in Atlanta that I was going to love this addition to the Queen City.   Finally went on a Monday night before a NC Music Factory concert. There is a cool bar seating area when you walk in that has a cool vibe and it is pretty large. There is a huge dining room behind the bar area too. It's was busy but got a seat right away.   Went with the OG margarita which wasn't too sweet. Loved it. The chips and salsa options on the table were very good and I loved the squeeze jar of hot sauce. Couple of drops will do it. We had friends who wanted the guac so we got that and also the chorizo quest fundido. The fried chips that come with the guac are superb. Crispy but not heavy. The queso fundido was a stringy spicy bowl of goodness with the tortillas it comes with we're perfect. Of course eating your weight in chips and salsa plus apps meant I couldn't order the fajitas I saw going out constantly from the kitchen so will have to go back.   I had the tacos Al pastor which has sweet grilled pineapple and pork belly. 3 small tacos that were a perfect sized entree after all of those chips. Wife had the shrimp salad which was pretty sizeable too and she loved it. Can't wait to go back. Best Tex Mex in Charlotte no doubt. And wife lived in Austin for a time and remembers the original Chuy's.",

    "text": "Pro tip: Come during non-peak times because this place is BOMB.  I am in love with their veggie enchilada. In. Love. The tortillas melt in your mouth and the flavor profile is really top notch. Many tex-mex restaurants shine in the meat department (carnitas, steak, etc.), and it's difficult to find a truly phenomenal veggie option. Superica wins.  Their nachos were also really loaded, which I was a huge fan of. They have lots of melted cheese, green onion, and more.  We were able to be seated right away at 2pm on a Friday, but we tried another time at 6:45pm and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. So, plan accordingly, or you can try to wait until the hype dies down. I'm not convinced that it will!",

    "text": "I had a good mind to take a pic but like many places, I'm quite sure what I ordered is already in the line up of pics.   I met friends here for lunch and it wasn't crowded. Parking across the street is $5, so if you're unlucky enough to not find some free parking during lunch time then you're sol and will need to pay. Unless you want to walk 3 blocks like my buddy did. I circled around a couple times before lucking out on a space right by the place.   It's pretty spacious, and we were there for 2 hours. Who knows, it could have been the day of the week, but it was pretty slow.   So I order an Arnold Palmer and our waitress is from Colorado so she gives me unsweetened tea and some homemade lemonade. Living in the south, you get used to sweet tea and lemonade. So I asked her to supe this up for me cause baby needs some sugar. She even added some extra simple syrup... I think. Cause it was still lightly sweetened but better than the tart drink I had initially. Would not prefer again for the $3 I was charged.   Food was eh. Hence the reason for the 3 stars. I had a beef taco which had decent flavor. I added some guacamole sauce to it, which is aight. And I had the lunch nachos which is literally 4 chips. Instead of the cheese that typically comes on it, I asked for the queso. I mean isn't that what nachos should have anyway? Who wants shredded cheese on nachos???   Soooo I guess lunch special means tapas. Thank god the beans and rice are bottomless, cause I would have left hungry and cranky. I mean for $11.99, it's just aight.   I'd rather go to one of those cheap Mexican joints and get a dish exactly the way it is rather than change things up. But I guess that's what happens when you go to a Tex mex joint? Iono.   The service was cool. There were a couple times Colorado lady came to the table and had the opportunity to refill my drink, buuuut didn't. Another lady came and asked if I could get a refill. Not a big deal but rarely have to ask for a refill for my drink.   Bonus: it was supposed to be an extra $1.50 for the queso on my chips but I wasn't charged. Maybe it made more sense to them in the kitchen to add that than shredded cheese.",

I'm a big fan of this place, mostly for their pancake. It is absolutely gigantic, and the honey-flavored syrup served with it is unlike a typical maple syrup. It might be the best pancake I've ever had, and I've had my fair share of pancakes.   I've also ordered their vegetable fajitas, chicken enchiladas, queso fundido with chorizo, huevos rancheros, and the potato/egg/cheese/chorizo brunch dish. Everything has been good, with the standouts being the queso and the fajitas. The fresh tortillas provided with the fajitas were delicious, good enough to eat on their own with the complimentary salsa. The only downside is that the prices are pretty high, although the quality is excellent.   I want to go back and try their cocktails, but I love the pancake so much that it will be difficult to pull me away from their brunch.",

Recommend: the steak fajitas- the steak alone was  and the chorizo con queso was flavorful, a little spicy but not overwhelming, and a nice addition to the complimentary salsa they provide. We also tried the puffy taco trio (chicken, beef, guacamole- you can choose to mix & match) on a puffy taco (bc I needed to know what a puffy taco was) and it was good, but not as great as the other dishes we tried. If you do decide to try it out, the smoky hot sauce at the table is recommended and helps liven it up. We will be going back. Great option for any size dinner party.",

To start out with the chips come out hot, and the salsa is some of the best I have had.  If you like playing with your food, go for the queso fundido, and have a \"pull\" contest at your table, taste great too.  We all ordered the fajitas and were extremely pleased (split them).  The not so fun part started with the water that was clearly collected from the drain pipes.  This made our extensive wait for a drink order all the more miserable.  The whole service line of Superica was clearly in \"sloth mode\". We ordered a guacamole app with our dinner, and told our waitress to bring it out before the main entrees. 30 minutes later and the first signs of hanger started to appear - Staring down every waiter carrying food, mean mugging every table that had their food, and checking our phones every minute.  Our waitress was no where to be found, so we flagged down a manager to ask the status of our order.  He gave us \"the 5 more minutes\" line, and then we started checking our phones like maniacs again (hanger). 10 minutes later we asked the waitress to cancel our guac, and after a whole hour we finally received our fajitas, with the wrong beans.  We then had to flag down another manager to get our order of beans, and spent the whole night with no refills on our drinks.  ***Totally would have been 5 stars, if this was all about food*** - Pro tip, bring a protein bar to hold off the hangry.",

Looking forward to trying out the newest Tex Mex spot in Charlotte, I was excited to hear that a good friend was having her birthday dinner there.  We arrive, complete party present and were bustled around the restaurant twice for adequate seating (they do not have reservations, regardless of the size of the party).   Once finally seated, our waitress was great (I think her name was Christina). I had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas (sauce is on the sweeter side, very tasty).   The cutest thing, you get a postcard with your check. And they mail it off for you. A cost effective way to promote your restaurant.",

Located in the trendiest restaurant section if Charlotte, Superica provides high quality Tex mex food and drinks. We all started by downing their margaritas, including a jalapeno one. The Tequila Tonic was also a delicious cocktail. Once we got to our table, we hit the chips with a vengeance. The two green salsas were both to die one. (One is a tomatillo and the other a green tomato.)  The best dish I tried was the shrimp fajitas as the Shrimp had a chargrill on the outside that really added a flavor layer! Their pinto beans are also the best Ice ever had.  Service was great too! They have a flow to get tables checked, and our particular waitress was super nice and friendly!",

Definitely ate too many chips to start... almost ruined my need to eat dinner, but then the fajitas arrived. Presentation was really nice. The food was amazing.

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night with a girl friend. Wait was an hour and 15 mins at 7pm. Ouch, but not their fault and expected.  We ordered some drinks at the bar while waiting. I ordered the Mezcal margarita. At $14 it was expensive, but I liked the flavors. I probably would've liked the drink a lot better if it had been a bit cheaper.  I also later ordered the Light Rail at $13. Bourbon, blood orange liquor, agave, and chilli bitters. This drink was also good. Again, just pricey but basically on par with other cocktail prices in Charlotte (unfortunately)  We finally got seated. We split the queso fundido. At $10, again a bit expensive. Everyone seems to love the cheese pulls. It was good, but for some reason I think I prefer the more traditional queso. They have that as well, which I may try next time.   The salsas were delicious and brought out right away. One was more of a smoky chipoltle and the other was a green salsa. Excellent and the chips were great as well.   I ordered the pollo con mole aka chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. I really enjoyed this entree. The mole sauce was very good. Great chocolate and cinnamon spice flavor. Came with a side of rice and beans.  Overall, it was a good meal and our service was fantastic. Shout out to Holland for a great night. I think next time I'd order something like the fajitas to share with someone else.   I've said it a few times, but I'll say it again- this place is expensive. 2 drinks, half a queso, and an entree and I was at $50 by myself before tip. I can walk to this place from my house and will probably be back, but I think Bakersfield is on par with this place or better and is cheaper.",

    "text": "Superica (pronounced Super-eeka) has been on our list for a long time, but we waited until now to visit, given their popularity and long waits.  We ventured out one Sunday evening for dinner, and then again the next weekend for breakfast, and finally understand the hype.    What's great?  Well, quite a lot!   * First, their salsas are homemade, and some of the best we've ever had.  Their avocado-tomatillo has a nice tang and is their mildest.  Their roasted salsa has a medium heat, and is my favorite.  Their breakfast salsa is mild-medium, and tastes wonderful on eggs. * Their food is thoughtfully created and prepared.  I'll share more about that in a bit. * The atmosphere and decor are modern and comfortable.  Tables are reasonably spaced, seating is comfortable, and the music is also some of the best we've heard.  According to the manager, they have someone create their own mix to be played at all of their locations.  Think rock, bluegrass, country, you name it.  It's an eclectic mix, and just works.  * Service is friendly and helpful.  We've not wanted for anything during either of our visits.  Now onto the food.  I'd give dinner four stars.  For our appetizer, the queso fundito with chorizo was bursting with flavor.  And they aren't skimpy on the chorizo, either.  The El Lopez is a great combo plate if you want to try everything.  My hubby shared his puffy queso taco with me, and while I love the concept and taste, it was a little hard to cut given the thickness of the tortilla.  The cheese enchiladas and beef taco were quite delicious.  My Shrimp Tacos Dorados was a bit of a disappointment, however.  The three tacos were small and full of fried shrimp, cabbage, and sauce.  But the taco shells tasted like they were made earlier, and then sat around before being assembled.  I wouldn't get this again.  With each meal, you get rice and beans, family style, and they were awesome.    For breakfast, I'd give it an EASY five stars.  I have to tell you about their coffee.  They use Honduran coffee, which has an unusual--but absolutely delicious--flavor.  Maybe cinnamon or something else?  I had the Migas Plate, which was scrambled eggs with chorizo, onions, jalapenos, tortillas, and topped with cheese.  It was a huge pile, served with three warm (and handmade) flour tortillas that made wonderful wraps.  I would get this dish again and again, and frankly think it's the best egg dish I've ever gotten at a restaurant.   My hubby got the huevos rancheros.  He asked for his eggs medium, and they were served on top of two crispy homemade fried tortillas, topped with beans and sauce, and served with avocado and wonderfully crispy bacon.  Here's where the breakfast salsa really shined - it was a perfect topping for his eggs, and I used it on mine, too.  Lucky for us, they serve their beans for breakfast, too.  Yum!  We returned for breakfast another weekend, and I got the Huevos Mexicanos, and my husband got the potatoes, chorizo, and eggs.  The Mexicanos is good if you want a vegetarian option, but the Migas Plate is still my favorite, as the chorizo adds a ton of flavor.  My husband loved his plate, and would definitely get it again.  We might try getting just one pancake to share, too.    Just a couple of tips - don't sweat over the parking.  If you can't get a free spot on the street, there's a $5 lot literally across the street from Superica's entrance.  And come early or late to avoid the big crowds and a long wait.   And FYI - Jenni's Splendid Ice Cream is just around the corner.    All in all, I'd give Superica 4.5 stars, rounded up.  I hear they may be trying to find a location in Lake Norman, but until then, we'll be frequent visitors at this location!",

We had the tamales to start out and the meat was a bit dry. The chicken mole enchiladas were odd because the mole was super sweet (like dessert sweet). The shrimp dorado tacos were so bland that I ended up dumping a ton of salsa and hot sauce on it. For the price, I would expect better tasting food. I will say that their salsas were pretty good. Hands down the highlight of our meal.  I've heard brunch is better than dinner here so maybe I'll give them another shot and try their brunch menu.",

I don't know which salsa I prefer I kept sampling both to pick a winner and couldn't. The fundido was also very tasty. I like that you have to grab it up with the fresh tortillas. It the real deal.   For dinner I wanted to sample some tacos so I ordered the shrimp taco and two puffy tacos. I really enjoyed the shrimp taco it's deep fried and loaded up with flavor and then topped with avocado. Sooo good. You have to try this! The puffy tacos didn't do it for me. Not sure what I was expecting but they didn't wow me.   My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good. When I return, I'd absolutely order them. I really like how the sides are endless and family style so you can share, enjoy and repeat over and over.   I also really like they little postcards that they give you after your meal. What a cute way to advertise and and a sweet note to someone!   I am excited to give this place a try for brunch.

    "text": "There has been a ton of hype about Superica. I was a little worried it wouldn't live up to it, but it definitely did!   We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was not at all crowded. We came after a show, so it was a bit of a weird time. I've heard it's pretty crowded during normal hours. We were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and walked through the menu with us since we hadn't been there before.   Based on research, we knew we had to get the queso fundido. We decided to add chorizo and it was incredible. Sure the cheese pulls are fun, but the flavor really brings it home. I ordered El Lopez and my husband got the steak fajitas. We both loved our meals.  It's definitely upscale Mexican/Tex-Mex and the prices reflect that, but the portions are generous and the quality is high. I really enjoyed the decor if the restaurant as well.   This is some of my favorite Tex-Mex in Charlotte. If you haven't had a chance to check it out yet, I highly recommend you do (and then go get ice cream at Jeni's). We will definitely be back!",

Set inside an old warehouse in South End, the dining room is spacious, with high ceilings, and nice and spread out, so you don't feel on top of anyone else. The staff is really friendly and food is known to come out timely and quickly. I also think the portion sizes are perfect for someone who eats a basket of chips -- literally by myself -- as an appetizer.   - Drink: Mexican coke for you non-alcohol lovers and for those looking for some alcohol the Chelada -- Dos Equis over ice, with fresh lime juice and a salt rim - Dessert: Unique take on tres leches (and a MUST GET): cake soaked in cream and topped with fresh whipped cream and passion fruit drizzle. The passion fruit drizzle is a unique",

    "text": "Had heard so many good things about Superica and I love Mexican food so off we went.  Grabbed some lunch on a weekend and it was really tasty.   Really like the decor as it has a southwest feel but is open and airy.  Lots of light and inviting.   There is a lot of room but from what I hear, this place can fill up.     Service was really good and our waitress provided a lot of good suggestions to try.  She was spot on with her recommendations and she was very attentive to our table.    From a food standpoint, everything was really good.   We started with the Campechana de Mariscos (cevechie with shrimp, crab and octopus).  The flavor was out of this world.  My only complaint would be the container that it was served in.  For our mains, we got the Chicken Verde enchiladas and the Tacos al carbon (carnitas).  The Verde enchiladas had a good spice to it.  It had good heat that built up over time (just like I enjoy).  The Carnitas tacos were different than the norm but again had good flavor.    Overall this was a good experience.  One complaint that I have is that there are a number of items that seem to be overpriced.  But I will be back.",

    "text": "I went back and forth if Superica should get a 3 or a 3.5 star review. I've been here about 5 times (3 for dinner and 2 for brunch)  The space is really cool. There are a ton of large windows that let in a lot of natural light during the day and at night time the ambiance is gives off a chic western feel. The tables and chairs are all wood and the booths are a plush cognac leather. There is a massive projector that separates the two areas in the restaurant. They play movies and concert sets. The music is typically very loud. So much so that it feels like you have to scream to the people on sitting across the table. There is a really large patio area. I personally haven't sat out there, but there are string lights and it looks really fun.   There is a very large bar that runs across the entire front of the restaurant and a smaller one in the other room. The bar is stocked from wine, beer, to margaritas and they have a vast amount of liquor to wet your whistle.  For dinner I've tried the fundido, queso, salads, and tortilla soup  For brunch I've had the huevos rancheros and tried the pancakes  Brunch is BY FAR better than dinner.   The cheese dips are both very good. I actually think I prefer the queso though. The salad I had was actually very good. It wasn't anything special though. The tortilla soup is a salt lick. Not worth ordering.   The huevos rancheros are some of the best I've had. They typically fry the corn tortilla that comes with it, but I ask them not to. There's bacon and avocado.... delish! What is truly a surprise though... is how amazing the pancakes are. They are a stand out. They come with a toffee-like butter as a syrup. MMMM so good!  Service has always been pretty good. Definitely better during the day than at night. The last time I was there (a few nights ago) we ordered queso twice and twice we were left chip-less so when we did finally get chips re-ordered the queso was cold. No one was happy  So overall, brunch is your better bet.",

    "text": "I'm going to put Superica down as pretty 'super' in my book. However, I will stress that what you order is liable to change your experience so it's pretty important that you take heed of my next piece of advice:   ORDER THE FAJITAS.  Once you go in with that bit of knowledge, you'll be operating at a 50% better advantage than your fellow dining patrons. That's a free math equation for you guys.  I've been to Superica twice and the only thing memorable from the first visit was the chips and salsa. They provide two complimentary salsas (green has a more garlic flavor and red is the spicier one) which are delish and even better when mixed. I've found the chips are on the saltier side than other restaurants but still good in my book.  On my first visit I ordered the Tommy's margarita which I found a bit weak and the shrimp ceviche. The ceviche tasted fresh but was just 'meh' to me. I also got to try the infamous queso but I wasn't blown away (I much prefer Bakersfield for queso).  This second visit, I went with a friend during the lunch time and sat at the bar. The restaurant wasn't busy but was definitely getting there. I was very pleased to find out that they bar hooks and outlets at the bar.  I started off with a sangria (it was also during their brunch hours) and placed my order for chicken fajitas. The sangria was pretty weak; I've yet to find the 'right' drink of theirs that has a bit more kick.  While we were waiting for our food, we got to speak with the bar manager who let us know their tortillas are made in-house. We also got to chat about various restaurants in Charlotte and he really elevated the experience for me.  I do feel the need to mention that there seemed to be a bit of a mix up/miscommunication between the servers regarding which orders belonged to whom at the bar. Once that was figured out, we received our food (both different orders of fajitas) and dug in. Everything from the presentation to the flavor, the chicken fajitas were on point. Yes, the fajitas are the more expensive menu item (maybe most expensive?) but WORTH IT.  The fajita come with 'bottomless' rice and beans which may be my other favorite thing about Superica. The bar manager let us know that two people typically share fajitas but I had to laugh at that because I wouldn't dare share these fajitas.   There's a large outdoor back patio and the parking situation sucks. I've lucked up with decent street parks. My only advice is to either get there super early or be patient and keep circling for an open spot!",

We had to wait as there seems to be about a 20 to 30 minute wait most weekend nights. We seated and immediately order the tamales followed by two entrees, the pollo con mole enchiladas, and the shrimp tacos. The tamales were very dry on the inside without much flavor other than the sauce they were soaked in. The sauce flavor was good but the dry meat was hard to get past. Then came our entrees. They were plated well and looked tasty. I bit into the enchiladas and could taste the strong cinnamon  and cumin  flavors mixed in. I lime mole but the flovars didnt seem to blend well as i could taste the strong over used seasonings. My fiance was not happy with the tacos. The shrimp was dry and lacking flavor. The service was excellent and professional but the food just didnt seem to match the reputation. We hear brunch is really good and will have to come back and try it to see if we chamge our minds about the pkace.",

The Tacos came out crisp and in a decent time with the crowd. The sides of rice and refried beans come family size and were popping hot.

I have come a few times and it's just too much cheese, salt, and oil in my opinion. The wait service has always been good but what i've noticed every time is that the hostess staff aren't. It's tough to come here with a large group since they don't take reservations. Knowing this [the most recent time I was here], my family came at about 5:30 and it was not too full there were noticeably open tables but it took 15 minutes for them to put our table of six together. I'd come back in another year once they're a little more settled into Charlotte.",

Before I even got my entree, I could tell how flavorful it was about to be based on just the chips & salsa. Yes, you heard right. The salsa was green, like it was mixed with avocado and was one of the best I've ever had. Not to mention our waitress was on it with the chip refills. I was stuck on what entree to get but went with the huevos rancheros. Sadly, I don't like sunny side up so I subbed for scrambled. When the food came out, it LOOKED small but was so filling!! I seriously can't wait to go back and try something else.",

You could tell the bartenders were very busy and working hard, but nonetheless had incredible service. Because they were so busy, the bar manager told us to have a seat outside and he brought our chips and guac to us outside on the patio- even though it was supposed to just be bar service.   Once we were able to sit, I ordered the shrimp tacos. Service was really fast once we were sitting. Our drinks made it to us within 5 minutes, and our food within 15ish minutes. The tacos were incredible and so filling! The bottomless beans were also incredible, and I love that they are bottomless. The bar manager that had served us earlier even came over to us a few times to check on us and make sure we were situated okay.   Overall, food was delicious, restaurant is beautiful (but yes, very crowded), and service was very attentive and personable! I'll definitely be going back soon!",

As for drinks, we had La Paloma (El Jimador Blanco, fresh lime, glass bottle of Squirt and salt) and El Frio (El Jimador Blanco, Stirrings triple sec, fresh lime, served frozen).  Both drinks were great and I especially loved that you get the whole glass bottle of Squirt with your Paloma!  You can tell they use fresh ingredients in their drinks.  For lunch, we had the lunch special which included your choice of two lunch items (taco, salad, soup, enchilada, or nachos) plus family-style retried beans and rice.  The mole on the chicken enchilada was phenomenal; very rich with amazing flavor.  Nachos are stellar as well; they dress their nachos individually, so that every chip is sure to have beans and cheese on top. That's the kind of attention to detail that makes this place so good. Even the house salad isn't your run-of-the-mill house salad; it has toppings like crispy tortilla strips, radish, cheese, cilantro and cucumber.   The staff was very friendly and attentive during both visits, which is hard to do in your opening week.  This place is kid-friendly with kid menus for food and drink, crayons for drawing and a louder ambiance that will make parents of smaller kids a little more likely to relax! We live close by and can see this place being a staple!",

They are usually very boring and flavorless - basically peppers and tomatoes without the meat that usually goes with it, maybe a few mushrooms. Not the case at this place. They are chockfull of great stuff like cauliflower, carrots, sweet potatoes, red cabbage. And the flavor is so wonderful! My new favorite spot for fajitas, especially when I am feeling a meat-free day.",

One issue with brunch; there's only one dish that isn't \"eggs\"; the pancakes which (I love) are huge & served with a syrup/buttermilk combo. Excellent quality and service has been consistent.  The major issue we continue to have is the seemingly lack of efficiency at the \"check-in\"/entry station and staff.  Currently waiting \"25-30 minutes\" along with many others while there are a number of tables that remain empty/available.  At least they're willing to text you when it's your turn for a table. Avoid coming at traditional supper time. Earlier is easier.",

The decor is great, a new western ~*vibe*~  Entrees are pretty expensive but then you'll realize they're actually for two people and come with sides. So, $25 for two to eat in this pretty place is good. This place does come up as a suggestion for \"cheap eats\" ...That's really not gonna be the case with this place, considering you're probably going to order a drink and appetizer. If you want cheap eats go to Tacos El Nevado ( good al pastor tacos, homemade tortillas,  and better, no frills queso -but, no atmosphere).  First time in, service was great and food was GREAT.  It was lunch. Queso was OK but the heritage pork belly was amazing. It came out sizzling on a fajita plate with warm, soft tortillas. The sauteed onion with the fiery grilled peppers and butter slathered in the tortilla with pork belly was just heaven. They hadn't been open for even 72 hours and it was impressive.  Second time in, for dinner we felt that our server was trying to rush us out, and the same dish came out different than the original visit. The plate wasn't hot so not the same theatrics with the ~*sizzle*~ the temp came more like warm so half way through it became cold. The tortillas they gave this visit were not like the first time, they were not fresh and were quite tough/stale.   First visit was perfect, 2nd was disappointing. Thankfully, if things aren't going so good, management is involved and cares. Worth a revisit just because of that. We all recommended this place after the first visit to everybody and we will continue to because of customer service.",

    "text": "We are from Texas and we have been living in the Carolinas for about 9 months now. I love living here, except for two things: 1. You can't find good beef in the deep south. It's all pork all the time.   2. They don't know a damn thing about Tex-Mex in the deep south.    Well, I can cross number two off that list now. After our visit to Superica yesterday I finally have a Tex-Mex place to go in the Charlotte area. Since we have only been here once I'll give you an overall impression and a blow by blow on the things we tried.  Overall The food is really good. The Chef knows what he is doing, and the food is prepared in an authentic way using high quality, authentic ingredients. Now, that's not to say that everything is perfect, because it's not, for me. This Chef has a sweeter palate in Tex-Mex than I prefer. For example, the enchiladas seem to be finished with a chocolate sauce. It's good, but it's a little sweet for taste. I prefer red sauce on my enchiladas.     The service was over-the-top excellent. The staff were all super friendly, attentive and helpful, as was the manager on duty. They took the time to explain the food and then menu, which was a little odd for us, but it makes sense when you consider that the food is probably unlike anything the locals have every had. After all, most Tex-Mex in the deep south is really bland and consists mostly of tacos and enchiladas.  The restaurant is very cool and has an authentic southwestern feel to it. The tables and chairs are nice and comfortable and there is plenty of seating. The space is very open with really high ceilings and lots of windows. There is lots of parking across the street, which I think they will be needing in the future.   Specifics I had the Parilla Deluxe which is grilled steak and chicken and camarones brochetas. The steak fajitas were among the best I have ever had. They were perfectly marinated to maximum tenderness, but not to the point of being chalky. They had a great grilled flavor as well. The chicken fajitas were super tender and juicy. They had some kind of BBQ sauce on them that was a little heavy on the poblano(?) and bit too sweet for me. But they were still very good and perfectly prepared.  The camarones (shrimp, wrapped in bacon with cheese and jalapenos inside) were really good. They could use a bit more jalapeno bite and a little less grill time, but they were good. The fajita fixins were a little on the small side, but that is easily remedied by asking for more. The tortillas were good and looked as though they were made in house and very fresh. The refried beans were outstanding. If you are a fan of refried beans you have got to try these!   My wife has the picadillo enchiladas. They were very good, however, as I mentioned above the chocolate sauce is too sweet for my taste I would recommend that they add an option to get them with a red or green sauce as well.   My son had the BBQ Brisket sandwich, holy cow was that thing huge! It looked beautiful and he said the taste was amazing. I would have tried it, but it had a ton of guacamole on it and I hate that stuff.   If you are looking for authentic Tex-mex in the Charlotte area this is your only option, but it is a good one and you won't regret it.",

Always checked to make sure we were good... brought us what we asked for and sweet personality. I highly recommend you ask for her, she's great!!",

Smaller plates but was the perfect amount along with drinks.    If you don't try the puffy taco, your only hurting yourself....it's small , so you can add it to whatever you get.  I am well traveled in the southwest and Mexico and I had never heard of a puffy taco.   I think it's a San Antonio thing.   Just DO it!!!!",

The decor and vibe are awesome, the food is to die for and the service was top notch!   Should put to Leo who was one of the best servers I've ever experienced!  Leo was very knowledgeable of the menu and made excellent recommendations which turned out to be delicious. He asked us if it was our first time and if we want to know about the menu.   Amazing job Leo!  Reading other's reviews you can notice that all servers are amazing, so that's what I called 5-star customer service experience. Good job for management!   I got chicken fajitas al carbon. Omg! I can't describe the taste of the chicken but hands down to the best tortillas I've ever had in my life. No kidding.   My first impression was actually, that it was not going to be enough because my husband ended all the chips with the salsas that come with our drinks. I was not able to finish my second fajita!   I got a margarita. Not the best one, however, our experience was incredible.  My husband Got the chicken suizas enchiladas. And there were no leftovers for him.  The portions are BIG, so keep that in mind when looking at prices.   Some of the best food and service you'll ever get  This will definitely be a regular spot for us!",

We enjoyed the complimentary chips and dip and we liked how two salsas are offered. On the other hand, my meal was so so. I ordered the enchiladas.

The restaurant is spacious but it's popular. So come early or late, or be prepared to wait. I would describe the decor and tex-mex modern. The service was warm and speedy, but the food... mmmm!  I don't know if they make their salsa from scratch, but if they don't they do a good job hiding it. Rookie mistake eating all the chips before the food came.   I ordered the steak fajitas... they were enormous. They can absolutely be shared with two people, but if you're hungry you might be able to chow it all down. On top of the steak prepared medium rare and the charred veggies that went great around the four tortilla, the revelation in the dish was the Mexican butter... it elevated the dish to me to a whole new level. I would drink it if it wouldn't give me a heat attack.   The margaritas were excellent the the michelada was quite refreshing.   I think this place will be a southend staple for a long time.",

The food was good, but the atmosphere and location is why I'm giving it 4 stars.  By the time we left at 7, it was very crowded with no where to wait on a table, making it difficult to leave.

    "text": "(3.5 stars) we came here for a double date night with friends of ours since it's been on my list to try for awhile. Heads up, they won't seat you until your whole party has arrived. The vibe of the place was very good and it was a lot bigger than expected. We sat back by the kitchen and our table was comfortable. I ordered the Matador and at $10 I was hoping for a slightly larger drink but it was good, it did come with some cilantro in it so if you think cilantro tastes like soap make sure you pick it out. The Tecate light was $5 a pop for approximately a 10oz glass (12oz tops) which is wildly overpriced The service was okay, but it took us a hour to order drinks and receive our food.   When we got our food it was mediocre. I would have liked more pineapple on my tacos al pastor but I did appreciate that the tacos were double tortillas so they didn't tear apart easily. My husband got the grilled Chile rellenos and was happy with the portion size. I guess overall we were looking for more flavor. Now that we've been there we can check it off the list but we wouldn't rush back.   Side note, the menu online was slightly different than in the restaurant.",

    "text": "WOW!! I was really blown out of the water by this more authentic Tex-Mex restaurant!! I went in on Saturday where our experience started with a very friendly hostess. Even while the hostess was on the phone she made sure to address us and let us know it would be just a moment. She took our name down with a \"text when table is ready\" system. She told us it would be an hour wait. We grabbed drinks at the bar, where we were served very promptly!   They have a nice waiting area next to the bar that has a sofa and some chairs so we took a seat and it wasn't even 15 mins before we had a text that our table was ready. As we walked into the main dining area I was pleased to see a very open, bright space! It's got a rustic feel to it and gosh the patio looks amazing, of course it was too cold to eat outside Saturday but I'll definitely be back to enjoy it.   Our server approached our table very fast and warmly welcomed us. He made sure to ask if it was our first time and it was so he explained the two salsas that they served and walked us through the menu. He was extremely helpful because the menu is a bit overwhelming.   We ordered a grilled pepper that was stuffed and a mix of tacos to share with a side of rice and beans. We enjoyed our beverages while we waited. The manager did come by the table and let us know our food would be ready shortly and made sure we had everything we needed.   Our food was a HUGE portion and I'm glad our server told us that items were large enough to share! The grilled stuffed pepper was my favorite, very smokey flavor. The tacos were great flavor but I'm not a fan of the corn tortillas. Wish they offered both and if they do then that should be asked when ordered. I also thought the tacos were a little small for the price. This was really my only disappointment in our experience.   Our server came back to check on how often and boxed our food for us. I would suggest this restaurant looking for real Mexican flavors in a little nicer setting! Y'all really should check this spot out :) it's a great addition to Southend!",

My company did a staff lunch with a group of 18--Superica does not take reservations and your whole group must be present to be seated. They handled our large group with grace and had us seated quickly. The service from beginning to end was phenomenal, shout out to our super-waitress Nicky!  The chips and salsa to start were great, really salty which is my favorite. They serve two different salsas, options are always good. We also ordered guac and queso. The guac was super fresh with huge chunks of avocado--it didn't last long on the table.   Most of our group ordered from the lunch special section where you get your choice of two items (plus rice and beans) for $11.99. Just a heads up, the portion size for lunch is very large. The soup especially is served in a bowl regardless.   I ordered the soup and chicken suizas enchilada and could not speak more highly of it. It was really flavorful. We had the tres leche cake for dessert and it was ah-maze-ing. Please order that!",

Parking can be difficult as the only available spots are across the street in a metered lot. They do not take reservations, however we went out. A Friday night at 7 and were seated within 20-30 minutes, so I that as a win!  The margaritas are the jam. The OG and Tommy's are the two my fiance and I order regularly. Both are made with reposado tequila and the Tommy's is made with agave vs simple syrup which gives it a slightly sweater edge.  Food is delicious! According to my fiance the mole is amazing and probably done the the most authentic. I've had the skirt steak fajitas and the catfish...both are  very tasty! Needless to say we had nothing to take home. It was busy when we went and had to wait a bit for drinks, but we'll worth it. Will definitely be back for more!!",

    "text": "Well, well, well - my long and exhausting search for a good Tex Mex spot in Charlotte ended tonight. Superica knows no peers in Charlotte. This place stands on a hill all her own.   After a long beatdown type of day at the bank I refused to cook. I pulled up my Yelp and scrolled through local digs. In the mood for Tex-Mex, Superica caught my eye.   Located in a vintage warehouse looking location Superica's ambiance provided plenty of stimulation for the eyes. I loved the decor of the place and the vibe.   Oh yeah...the food rocked!   I ordered the \"Parilla Deluxe\" (Grilled Steak, Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas) and the \"Pollo Con Mole\" (Chicken Enchiladas smothered in a delicious mole sauce). Both dishes sizzled with spices, flavor and freshness. I only wish they increased portion sizes. I just couldn't get enough of this food. Even the Salsa surprised me. The flavor profiles on their salsas, look, listen - I can't even really describe it. You've just got to try it.  The servers and bartenders here are also really nice and attentive. Tanner was especially nice and great at her job! You rock Tanner!!  You're not going to get better Tex Mex here in Charlotte. Is this place better than Tex Mex in Texas? No Sir (Or Ma'am), but it's clear winner in this town.n",

    "text": "I wanted to try somewhere new and exciting for my 30th birthday dinner, and my husband and I landed on Superica. I'm so glad we chose this spot to celebrate this special occasion. Our server (whose name has slipped my mind, unfortunately) was fantastic - super attentive, friendly, and helpful as we navigated the menu. The space itself was super-spacious -- not sure what we were expecting, but wow -- ample space for smaller, intimate groups or large parties. We didn't go outside but the patio area will be a great option when we're back in the warmer months.   We started our meal with the classic chili con queso, which was everything I expected it to be - cheesy gooey goodness. Next time I want to try the Queso Fundido, though I suspect this might be a better option for a small group, rather than 2 people. The salsas that are brought out for every table free of charge were also super yummy, and also pretty unique -- we particularly enjoyed the avocado-based dip.    My husband and I both tried the tacos for our main course and ordered three apiece, plus beans (black beans for him, refried for me). I tried the Tacos de Barbacoa (SO yummy - probably my favorite), the Tacos Al Pastor (very close second -- made with pork belly), and the Shrimp Tacos Dorados (reminded me of a small quesadilla in how it's served, also quite tasty).   Pro tip: parking can be a little tough to find in this area as there's not a designated lot, but street parking is free after 6 pm.   Overall, I highly recommend this place and look forward to our next meal there!",

So glad we came by as Superica could quite possibly be the best Tex Mex in Charlotte!!!  We came on a Saturday and there was about a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad! The space is pretty large and open!  We both ordered the house level marg and they were quite delish! We were immediately brought out a basket of chips and two different types of salsa....one was a green tomatillo avocado salsa and one was a roasted tomato salsa. Both were insanely good. The avocado salsa was my favorite!  We started with the chorizo queso. I should say that I'm lactose intolerant, so if a queso isnt \"worth it\", I stop eating it. This queso was AMAZING. There was something about it that was unique compared to all the other quesos in the city.   My husband and I split the mixed fajitas. It came with steak, chicken, and bacon wrapped shrimp. Before I go into this meal, I wanna say that I am SO glad we split. The portion was really big and we both left so full. Ok, back to fajitas. The fajitas came with these nice warm tortillas, cheese, guacamole (absolutely delicious guac!), pinto beans, and lettuce. All the meats were nicely cooked. I think the steak may have been my favorite! The bacon wrapped shrimp were huuuge! The fajitas were made even better with the garlic butter sauce. All the flavors were just amazing. Just took fajitas to a whole new level!  If I HAD to give one small critique, it would be the beans. There was probably only one tablespoon of beans in our cup and the rest was just bean sauce. Though with that being said, I put the bean sauce on my fajita and it was amazing tasting ha.   Overall, insanely fantastic meal!",

The menu is a little pricier than I was expecting for tacos, and I was hoping to be able to order tacos a la carte. Be aware - you cannot do that. I ordered the tacos al pastor. I ended up being served shrimp tacos. Honest mistake, and the kitchen remade it for me. Our service was so good throughout the whole things that I'm not even concerned about the mix-up. When I did get my al pastor tacos, I didn't find them to be that great, to be honest. I've had a lot better and also paid a lot less for them. I'm giving Superica the benefit of the doubt because they're new. I hope they are working out some kinks, and I look forward to trying them again soon!",

    "text": "Yesterday, me and my super cool wakeboarding friend Scott went with a group to celebrate the 23rd birthday of our good friend, Tony, the Hitman whatever the hell his last name is. I asked if I could have my chicken enchiladas to go and I was told yes. My waitress then told me they don't place food in a to go box, and I'll have to put it all in their small to go box myself, so I did and scooped it all off the plate with a fork. Upon leaving, I set the to go box on the roof of my car, and drove off forgetting it was up there. So unfortunately, I can not leave a review on the taste of the food, as I've technically still never eaten here. However, I still tipped 20% because that's just the kind of Buffalo, NY bred man that I am.   #Bringyourowntogobox",

They have a full bar and hella seating. Our waitress, Jessica was awesome. She was very upbeat and got Deon and I all of our wants and needs. She explained everything very clearly and answered all of our questions because this was our first time. I got their smack pancakes with their amazing homemade syrup. Probably the best pancakes i've had in my life. I also got the BBQ Brisket sandwich which was delicious as well. So many flavors and spices,ughhh so gooood. I would highly recommend this restaurant and make sure to ask for Jessica!! She will take great care of you!",

Not a relaxing experience, knowing there was 25 empty tables we could have been seated at. Decided really not interested in staying for food.. we left...They did try to buy our meal, but we didn't go in expecting a free meal so declined.. Hopefully a learning experience for a new restaurant...#alwayssitatthebar",

    "text": "A red neon sign blinks near dusk on Worthington in South End: Tex-Mex Superica. You turn the corner to enter a massive, former textile mill turned into a dining area that has retained the openness of the former industrial center. The design is different shades of white, brown and orange with a wood floor for accent. A projector plays Pixar's Coco on a large wall separating the bar area from the main dining room. Neon signs hover over different areas pointing to \"el bano\" and \"el patio.\" The wait staff are dressed in chambray shirts; some waitresses are sporting red bandanas, completing the homage to Rosie the Riveter.   The menus are designed with fonts that seem plucked right out of the limited imagination of a millennial advertiser's idea of the southern United States border during the mid-twentieth century. Prices of entrees range in the low teens to the $35 short rib tacos which are highlighted because once they are gone, they are gone. The alcohol is also marked up to a laughable degree. Typically, a 24 oz. can of Tecate from the convenience store will set you back about $2.25. At Superica, 12 oz. from a Tecate can is $5.  Chips and the fire roasted salsa as well as avocado tomatillo salsa verde (\"a mouthful, I know,\" the waitress says) are offered free of charge. And, to be clear, the fire roasted salsa is the star of this whole bizarre experience of cross-cultural signifiers. It's beautiful and fresh. A kick without being overwhelming. From there, the tacos de barbacoa entree offers no added value. If anything, it diminishes the experience even further. The barbacoa is sliced in thick slabs and served in corn tortillas that seemed like they should've been placed in the fryer to become chips rather than the base of a main course. On top of the barbacoa, the bright minds of the Superica kitchen (which has locations in Houston and Atlanta) added, in True Tex Mex fashion, a heap of cole slaw to the top of the taco. However, this slaw overwhelms the dish and fumbles out of the tiny tortilla as if it is the star whose shine is too big to be contained. The result is a taco platter that is fine but borders on insulting when you remember that you're about to pay $15 for three cole slaw tacos.   The Superica experience is one typical of high-end fast casual. It's a machine. Drinks, chips, entrees then the check come at you in less than an hour's time on a Friday night. A flurry of wait and bus staff zip around the expanse in a fluid, worker bee-like drone. It's all one perpetual motion that serves its well-heeled, well dressed young professional patrons before showing them out to nightlife that awaits around the corner. It's factory dining that hints at a cultural experience with prices that don't forsake the South End clientele's sense of aspiration. This is another place, like the neighboring Hawkers, where street fare is painfully curated into a product that projects the liberation of our palettes but is nothing more than a generic, mass commodity that keeps the street from which it arrived at arm's length.",

You choose two items from their selective list, but the portion sizes leave your table looking as if you ordered the entire menu. Today I ordered a salad, and it was so big yet so delicious! I had to take part of it home. However, I will say apart from other restaurants, and they load you up on chicken in your salad. I had a piece of chicken with every bite.   However, I must advise right now with the massive construction that's taking place in Southend. I would not recommend coming precisely at 12 or 12:30 pm. Either come before the lunch rush or after or ride the train. Seriously! Parking is BANANAS in this area and with the old parking lot turning into the new Lowe's building. I'm not sure when better parking will become available.  But aside from parking, don't let that stop you from the yummy goodness this restaurant offers. You will be so glad you stopped in.",

They place is a warehouse with huge ass windows and they didn't shy away from being in a warehouse instead they flaunt it shamelessly with large walls of murals, high ceilings and some oversized vintage furniture thrown in random places. The ambiance is polarizing, you might love it all or hate it completely.  Even though the restaurant was huge with lots of tables, we were asked to wait for about 30 mins - quite understandable on a Friday evening. They have a text alert system so you can leave your number and name and roam around and check out the beautiful neighborhood. We were notified and once inside our waitress escorted us to our table. You get complimentary awesome thin nacho chips and two sauces - we were famished from the waiting and rummaged through the first bowl and our waiter was kind enough to offer a refill!   The menu is stupid simple - love when restaurants don't torture their patrons with a hundreds of options to choose from. The Mexican dishes are standard- fajitas, tacos and enchiladas. Surprised to see the fried fish menu! We ordered some Fajitas and Enchiladas And the turn around time was quick. The food was hot fresh tasty and full of flavors. I especially loved the Mexican butter that came along with my Fajitas. BTW, the Fajitas are huge and if you are a couple it's definitely shareable.   This is a great restaurant that's definitely worth checking out - unique ambiance, great list of wines and cocktails, great tasty food and great service. My only gripes to this restaurant as others have mentioned are the car parking problem which if you go in circles around the block you would find a slot soon and the other problem being the large and loud halls makes quite conversations impossible.",

During the day the dress code was casual and there was an abundance of seating. The ambiance of the restaurant was great with large windows and an out door seating area.   All guests receive a baskets of fresh tortilla chips and two different types of salsa (always a big sucker for the free tortilla chips). We ordered a bowl of queso to split amongst four people and found the size to be just right.   For the entrees we ordered: Tacos Al Pastor, The puffy taco dinner with picadilo (spiced ground beef) and the hamburguesa superica. All of which were very satisfying.   Seems like a great place for happy hour to grab a few drinks and eat some queso. Would definitely come back.",

The cocktails were out of this world. I went a little crazy on ordering them, but I regret nothing...  The O.G. - standard margarita but to the point - no mix here Mezcal Margarita - if you like smokey mezcal, get this drink (after ordering this I went on a mezcal kick for the rest of the night Light Rail - bourbon based drink with chili bitters (spicy and awesome) The Highwayman - an old-fashioned but with mezcal (my favorite drink of the night) Vampire Weekend - not just a good band, but a frappuccino-style horchata cocktail that was delish!  The guacamole was on point, flautas, tamales, you name it, it was delicious. They brought out some bone-in beef dish that was wildly satisfying. Geez. I wish I wrote this review sooner because I can't remember the name of it... anyway, I left super full and very tipsy (but thanks to uber got home safely, of course).  Cocktails - 6 out of 5... can I do that? Food - solid 5 out of 5 Service - 5 out of 5 (people are nice) Overall - GO HERE 5 out of 5",

Whew - just like in the telenovellas!!  Okay, let's keep it simple ... so maybe they just wear a cape with an S on it. And actually I think Chef Tina Aleandri  oversees daily operations in the kitchen...   The scale alone here is impressive - two massive indoor sections plus a patio occupy a brick building the size of a warehouse. The ambiance is a little kitsch meets hombre who turns around and smootches cowgirl. The decor breathes life and energy into the space and just makes you feel good.   I have always had a huge crush on Tex Mex and this place I dare say elevates the basics, both ingredients and techniques, to a whole new level. From the Guacamole, to the fresh made/roasted Salsas to the secret spicy green sauce (wink, wink) you have to ask for - they are well crafted.  I had a really enjoyable lunch on a Friday with some of my bestest compadres. The Chicken Suizas Enchilladas were reminiscent of those my mom used to make growing up and really made me smile.  Then there's \"La Paloma\" - an amazingly refreshing drink made with Jimador Blanco tequila, fresh lime juice, salt and the Big Daddy of all sodas \"SQUIRT\"!  The servers here have oodles of personality and do a good job of paying attention to the details.  Yes, as many have noted, the food is on the pricey side - that being said, I think they have listened and offer weekday lunch specials for $11.99 now.   Give 'em a try and I bet you'll be hooked!",

My first visit was for drinks, specifically the frozen Margarita, and Queso. The Margarita was on point and although frozen, which people think is filling, it wasn't, and had a nice touch of Tequila. But, be careful, they can sneak up on you. As for the Queso, words cannot describe it. Cheesy goodness...and be sure to add the Picodilla!  My most recent visit was an evening on the patio. Of course we started with Frozen Margaritas and Queso, but enjoyed a good variety of food items, including the Fajitas, Puffy Taco and Chili Arellano. Everything was so good, hot, great flavor and good portions. The space is a lot larger than I thought and very inviting and service is top notch. If you're a Tex Mex lover, be sure to check them out. And, even if you think you aren't, you will be after a visit here!",

I had asked in advance if we needed to reserve a table or anything since there were 12 of us, but they don't reserve tables and said we would be okay at that time. And everything was good. There was plenty of space. We had people coming at different times and our server didn't seem to mind and was very accommodating.   While we were waiting for our while party to arrive, we dug into some apps. We did a chile con queso and queso fundido. The queso was one of the best I've had. The fundido was interesting. It was a stretchy cheese that you put on a flour tortillas and a spicy sauce that came with it. It was flavorful, but I enjoyed the regular chile con queso more.   For my meal, I ordered the picadillo enchiladas which came with rice and beans. Everything was good, but I did have food envy of some of my friends plates. The pricing is a little high, but the portion sizes are decent. I think there are decent lunch deals.   What I most liked was our service and they handled a large group well.",

One thing I wish they did was to go over the salsas they had and explain the hot sauce on the table to others.   Our server was ok. She was attentive at first but disappeared afterwards. We ordered our food and started with the queso fundido. The queso was good and thick and creamy at the same time. The warm tortillas really added a nice touch to it. We each ordered our meal-we mostly got tacos and enchiladas with rice and beans. They were all good. But, our server was missing. Our drinks were seriously low.   When we were ready to leave we asked for 4 boxes. It took her over 10 mins just to get that to us and when she finally came, she only gave us 3 boxes. We had to wait again for the extra box and the check. Me and my husband were together and we told her that but it took another 10 mins for her to get us our check and the box and she put us separtely for our checks. She never came back to pick up the credit cards but someone else did.   Overall, the food is good but the service can be better. They get so busy so I'm surprised they don't try to turn their tables quicker.",

This time, I had the \"Picadillo\", the more generic Beef Enchilada meal. It wasn't as fancy as the \"Puffy Hard Taco Dinner\" that I had last time, but every bit as delicious. What's more, I had the most sensational drink ever, \"Vampire's Weekend\". Absolutely LOVED it!!  From its big, lofty ambiance, to an intoxicating menu of drinks and even a slightly eccentric menu of Mexi/Tex-Mex specialties, this place has what it takes to please just about any diner! Did I mention that this place even offers rare, non-traditional menu items (for a Mexi/Tex-Mex restaurant, that is!) like Hamburgers and Short Ribs??   So...again, it was another great dining experience here at Superica...and am sure to return soon!",

Nights and weekends are typically a packed house. After a friend shared her negative experience at Superica, I decided to try it for myself. I'm glad that I did.  The space is beautiful, rustic and equipped with 2 bars, including a beautiful outdoor patio space. It's located near the light rail which makes it a convenient stop if you're hanging out in Southend.   The hostess' personality left a bit to be desired. However, the waitress made up for what the hostess lacked by being very accommodating.   The food was absolutely amazing. It was, by far, the best fajita chicken that I've had in Charlotte. It's a basic dish but Superica elevates it with a dry rub smoked chicken that will have you coming back for more. The fajita meal with no tortilla or rice and extra guac salad is a great option for Keto dieters.   And then there's the margaritas. I'm a fan of a good margarita. While I'm not a fan of the Superica's glass size, I am a fan of The OG and Tommy's Margarita.",

I don't give 5 stars often- and Superica deserves it! Go if you are debating it!  Our service was WONDERFUL- our server was so friendly and attentive throughout our entire experience. There was also another server who saw our table was just recently finished our glasses and came right over to inquire about ordering more.  The decor was so different but so neat! There was a lot to look at. I also loved the area that the bartender was at. The outside patio I wish we could have sat at but it was HOT!  They gave complimentary chips and salsa which was amaaziiing!!! I had the beef and vegetarian (guacamole) tacos on a puffy shell which is kind of like a chip. I normally prefer bowl type Mexican foods and this was the closest thing I could find and I didn't regret it!!  The only complaint about the margs were that the glasses were small- but the content was heavy!!! I think a pitcher would be a great addition to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Just not a fan and here is why.  For me, it's mostly about the food.  I also factor in atmosphere and service.  The atmosphere was really great.  The service was average.  The food was not up to my standard.  I ordered the lunch special with a chicken enchilada with mole sauce and a cup of the chicken soup.   Normally, I love sopa de pollo in Mexican restaurants.  This soup had a dark broth and was more salty than the Atlantic Ocean. At first, I thought it was beef broth, but they assured me is was chicken broth.  I have just never seen chicken broth so dark.   The enchilada with mole sauce was okay, nothing special.  It was served with re-fried beans with pork.  I don't eat pork, so I left the beans on my plate.  I also like unsweetened tea with sweet and low.  They didn't have sweet and low.  No, i do not like Splenda or Stevia!   I love this part of town and am so happy there are a lot of restaurants.   This one could tweak their recipes and provide a different culinary experience.  The bar area looked alluring and I can imagine this place is hopping in the evenings.  I am not into hopping, however.  I am into great lunches.  That just didn't happen today.  Just the opinion of one.",

He was so welcoming and accommodating of our birthday girl. Sadie our server kept up with our requests for the amazing salsa and was the perfect mix of checking in often but not too much.  The food was on point, delicious, served pretty quick, and hot. I had mentioned our birthday girl is expecting when I checked in  and mid way through dinner Sadie brought  her up over a mocktini. This was in addition to the tres leches birthday cake and card addresses TO the birthday girl by name. Lots of thoughtful touches, great service and of course great food and atmosphere. The original opening glitches have DEFINITELY been worked out and we will be back! Thanks Superica!",

Their Fajitas are the best, worth the price for the portion size and quality.  We also love their Enchiladas, guacamole and both types of queso they offer.  A Tex-Mex favorite!",

We both had the shrimp tacos with corn tortillas, so good it will be hard to stray from this choice the next visit. Ohhh, the Guacamole. They nailed it...finally a Tex Mex restaurant in Charlotte that knows what their doing.  The salsa duo with super thin chips (my favorite) was on point and a great start to our lunch.

I took my girlfriend for a nice night out, spent about $100 with tip (we had a couple margs a piece) and left feeling like the experience wasn't worth that $$$.

Me and two friends were seated in the back by the kitchen and out of nowhere during our meal one of the busboys sizes up at us. He is standing on other side of the restaurant at the end of the tables where we were sitting, we are at our table and he throws his hands up and says you got a problem, towards my friends and I.  He continued  to do so til one of my friends told him to come to where we were if he thought there was a problem. He continued mouthing off and goes over to bar area talking about us to the bartender not far from us. Apparently the busboy must be a homophobe and thought me and my friends were looking at him while we were there, mind you they sat us by the kitchen so everyone passed us as they come out the kitchen and we have no choice but to notice everyone that passes. By far the worst experience I've ever had at a restuarant since living in Charlotte, NC. We did nothing to deserve such treatment. Made us feel very uncomfortable and not wanted at the establishment.  It was unprofessional and that individual does not need to be working directly with the public. Apparently if you are gay or have a friend or family member that's gay this may not be the place to go because they have a homophobic busboy on staff there that shows issue with lifestyle choices. Sad experience for a restaurant with good food.",

This isn't your neighborhood Chilis. I had a difficult time deciding between their brunch menu and regular menu.   We ordered the shrimp tacos (comes with rice and beans) and the queso fondida with chorizo.   FYI: For those who don't eat pork, the beans are rendered down with pork.

    "text": "Boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner before going out. We came in at 5:30pm and were sat right away. The place was quiet when we arrived , but pack at around 7pm when we left. We were greeted right away and brought over complimentary chips and salsa (darker spicier one was our favorite). Our server recommended us some drinks and my boyfriend got a tequila cocktail with squirt (not sure the name). Waiter gave us complimentary guacamole with chips. The chips it came with were delicious. However the quac was mediocre and would not recommend to anyone for $9, I make better quac on the regular. We then split an order of the steak fajitas. Food came out quick and very hot! The fajitas came with bottomless beans and rice, but we did not get another order. A single order of the fajitas filled us up and left us with leftovers. The star deduction is for the end of the meal. Server took a while to bring the check and when we finally got it, an order of guacamole was on the bill. We did not order this and even refused when someone came to drop it off at our table, only to find out the waiter \"gave it to us because they were working on their guac and wanted us to try it\". I had to ask for it to be removed, which is no big deal. However, it took him a while to bring the new check. Finally we got the correct check and gave him our card immediately. 5 minuted Passes...more time passes.. we watch him drop food to the table next to us...we watch him talk to friends and drop drinks..no check. Probably 15 minutes of waiting for a check. Only downside. Otherwise , 5 stars for the food.",

After we ordered our food which we each ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket tacos it took 45 min before we got our food. He asked for no beans and just rice. When the food came out they gave us beans, no rice because they were out and the server said it would be at least 15 minutes because they were out of rice so we said okay. The serve came back after 15 min and said they are still out of rice and that it would be an hour so we still had a drink to finish so we said okay. After waiting we told the server to not worry about the rice because we saw other meals being delivered to tables that had rice. Not sure how a Tex mex restaurant can run out of rice but they did according to our server. We were seated at 715 and left at 9. The whole ambiance is really nice but it was crazy how long it took to get our tacos, 45 min was absurd. It seemed like there was a lot of help but we noticed our server stacking cups so it seemed like she was overwhelmed.",

I was not deterred, and we went to OMB for a beer; 45 mins later our table was ready. The avocado tomatillo salsa and the smoky red salsa were delish. The classic queso was spicy, cilantro-y and velvety rich. I ordered ground beef tacos, which were everything I ever wanted in this life - crispy housemade shells, delicious picadillo beef, and all the right toppings. The BEANS. They are how refried beans should taste - and topped with blistering cheese. The RICE. Smoky, umami, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the carnitas which were actually pork belly fajitas, and they came with melted butter... with hot, fresh house-made tortillas. He died. Even the Dos Equis we had on draft tasted suspiciously delicious. It's like this place has made the perfect version of every tex mex food/detail there is. And I'm from Texas! I was skeptical y'all. But now I'm back home and dreaming of the day I can go back here! Go!",

We were warmly greeted at reception (it was MOBBED at 6 pm on Saturday night and still reception was kind and welcoming, not overwhelmed or brusque) and were told the wait for two would be between 30 and 45 minutes -- we were seated in 25 minutes. The homemade salsas and chips were creative, flavorful and delicious, and were delivered immediately. We didn't order  much -- just two entrees: skirt steak fajitas and steak nachos  -- but they were the best of their kind we'd ever had. We had a clear sight line to the kitchen and the pass, and the manager (John) has such a well-run shop that every dish was whisked away by a runner almost the moment it was placed on the pass, so every dish was delivered hot and fresh. The restaurant itself is beautiful -- industrial high ceilings with huge windows and the space is beautifully utilized. It was completely full, yet the noise level was more than acceptable. But all these terrific individual elements were brought together in perfect harmony by our fantastic waiter, Cassie -- She was warm, engaging, extremely quick and professional but perfect in every way. She made us feel like we could sit there forever -- with no alcohol ordered, no appetizers, no dessert -- and she was more than happy to have us there. That, my friends, is True professional service, and I have found it in very few places. (Shout out to John, the manager, as well, for his attitude was exactly the same as Cassie's.) We can't WAIT to go back to Superica!",

We debated whether to start with guacamole or ceviche and went with ceviche. When our waitress brought the ceviche she also brought us the guac to try.  Both were really good but the ceviche was so fresh and delicious.  Just then right spice.  I had the salad with chicken for my entree.  Also, really good.  It was really fresh, just the right combination and balance of ingredients.  Our waitress brought beans and rice but I couldn't touch them after so much food.  My friend said they were delicious.  Service was also really good.  Our server was training someone which can sometimes be distracting but this was not.  I am really happy they have come to SouthEnd- a great addition.",

They make their own salsas....the ones that come with the basket of tortilla chips.  Delicious.  The Vampire Weekend cocktail is deceptive because you can't taste the Kraken dark rum, so it would be easy to down it like lemonade.  The sizzle in this sip is the homemade \"horchata,\" a type of non dairy milk from rice and almonds spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Yum yum. The campechana was listed under \"salads,\" so I was surprised that it was a chunky blend of shrimp, crab, avocado, and octopus served over tostadas.....seafood salad, I suppose.  It was served in a parfait glass so I poured it out over the tostadas and ate it like nachos.  An all together happy excursion into tex-mex.  This place would be a destination night out from any part of Charlotte, if fun and tasty matter.  Very casual.  Already thinking about what to try on my next visit.",

There was no wait and they were able to seat us immediately, and we were greeted by so many employees there that welcomed us and thanked us for coming. We had a very comfy booth. The decor was great and I appreciated that there was a bartender in a designated area to just make drinks for the dining room. That guaranteed we got our drinks quickly!  First, the drinks. I ordered Tommy's Margarita. It was super tasty, but sooooo tiny. In 3 sips it was basically gone. Sad face.   Second, the queso. We were going to order both queso and guacamole, but the waitress suggested we order a different queso that had sausage, guac, and sour cream in it. That queso was incredible!!! I would go back just for the queso and chips.  The main meals were all good. I had the Carne Guisada. It was a stewed beef in a tasty sauce and two warm tortillas. It was very tasty, but I had no idea how to eat them. Do I put them in the tortillas and make a wrap? Do I use the tortilla as a spoon alternative? The tortillas were soooooo good. They felt like they made them right there. I wish they had brought out a plate instead of the wrapped tortillas and a small bowl of my meat served on a wooden tray. I had no place to mix them up or anywhere to put the rice and beans that were family style. I wish they gave more rice and beans for the family style. We were 4 people and were given the same amount one person would get at a traditional Mexican restaurant. Oh well. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food. My husband ordered Tacos al Pastor and loved them. They were kinda small, but he was surprised how filling they were.   The service was really fantastic. Our waitress did a great job of checking up on us, refilling our water, and giving us time to enjoy the experience. We paid our bill and then sat there for another 20 minutes catching up, and the wait staff continued to refill our waters and never once made us feel rushed. We felt bad when we left and saw a huge line of people waiting to be seated, but the staff never once made us feel like we were an inconvenience.   Overall, it was a good experience. It was a bit pricey, but I think I'd go back.",

    "text": "After months of hearing the raves, we finally visited Superica on a Monday evening for dinner.  Hopefully you can score free parking on the streets, otherwise be prepared to pay a flat fee ($6+tax) for the lot across the street - I felt that was rather expensive.  Superica is casual and the space is attractive, but the experience left much to be desired. Apparently the section we were seated had the bartender as the server. Although I am going to seriously slam the service here, I want to make it clear that the guy was set up to fail by having to take care of tables while tending bar during dinner hour in a busy restaurant. It was 15 minutes after being seated that someone came to my table and asked if I wanted water and put down chips and salsa \"while you are waiting for your server.\"  He did finally come and take our drink order - the house margarita was nothing to write home about and my tequila/chilled/up had so many ice shards floating in it, it quickly became very watered down. Kind of a bummer when you pay the premium cost for anejo. Service remained very slow.  I ordered the grilled chicken rellano and my friend got a combo type plate. Rellano literally means \"stuffed\". A more accurate description is that it is a deconstructed version, which is actually a little more diet friendly than a traditional rellano, but it just lacked any richness whatsoever.  The combo plate was just a huge plate of very heavy, greasy yellow cheese enchiladas and other tortilla-and-meat items with no remarkable characteristics that made us think someone would order it again. It also had a \"puffy\" tortilla with cheese sauce over it that did not get with our meal until (the manager?) passed through checking on tables and rustled up for us. We were credited some money on our check for that, but it did not change the fact that it was, again, not anything either of us would seek out again. The rice and beans were non-remarkable also. Maybe Tex-Mex isn't my thing. Application of fresh herbs,citrus, etc is the joy of good Mexican food. Everything we tried seemed to lack those elements.  I did not check the menu before we went, so in all fairness, had I done that I also would not have been surprised with how pricey it was. The food was little different than most Mexican chains, but easily 30% higher priced.",

Didn't have to wait at all on a Sunday evening, the staff was pretty attentive, and the food was good.  Ordered the OG margarita which tasted very fresh and delicious, so always a plus in my book if you get a good marg.  The salads are also very tasty and very fresh! The milder one is the green one and made with avocado. And then they have a spicier (although not over bearing) option which was equally as fresh and you can tell they make them in house.  Chips also came out hot which is a bonus, and they replenish them for you.   I ordered the ceviche as my entree (listed as an app) and honestly was plenty for me as a meal, as I wasn't starving.  And it was absolutely delicious!  Comes served on crispy chips and is delightful.   Enjoyed the experience and would probably go back.",

    "text": "It's rare that I feel that a place is five stars right from the jump. The first time we tried to have dinner at Superica, on a Saturday,the wait was more than an hour and we left. Cut to the following Tuesday, my coworker and I decided to pow wow after work and I suggested we try Superica again. We had back up plans prepared just in case. Turns out we were super lucky to be seated right away and we secured awesome parking easily, too!   The atmosphere was very different than other places in Charlotte. We joked that there should have been tumbleweeds crossing on the video that was playing on the projector. The restaurant has great attention to detail from the complimentary matches to the beautiful bathrooms.   We each ordered a drink and got down to business with the menu. The sangria was not very strong but I would recommend their house blended margarita. Sneaky, sneaky. One more and I would've been giggly all night.   I love that we received chips and salsa to start. The chips were crisp and thin, both salsas were fresh and added flavor to our meal. The presentation of the salsas with descriptions of each was a nice surprise. Not just a filler item, no stale chips and jarred salsa here. We each ordered fajitas with queso fundido to start. It was an insane amount of food. You are definitely getting what you pay for and can choose to share an order of fajitas between two people. The mixed fajitas with shrimp would be my top choice for the shrimp alone! Each shrimp has a sliver of jalapeno tucked into the backside and then wrapped in bacon and I'm assuming deep fried. Ooh... just give me those skrimps! The queso is worth the hype and is great on its own but there are options for toppings. Both plates came with warm tortillas. The fajitas come with an array of toppings, rice and beans with cheese. Do not skip the beans. I \"don't like\" beans. Mm-hmm. Not anymore. Superica's refried beans are topped with cheese and popped under the salamander to become a melty, toasty, dip-able side. Friend, turns out I like refried beans.   Make sure to check out my picture of my to go box. I'm not kidding when I say I had a ton of food. I went home with enough to eat another meal. We spent a pretty penny: $108 before tip for two with an app, 2 meals and 4 cocktails. And still I say I can't wait to come back!   P.s. My food was so good, I somehow wound up using my pants as a napkin and I still didn't care. Take that as you will.",

Ordered flautas for an app, the portion is pretty large and the food was good. As soon as the app arrived we ordered our dinner, chicken enchiladas. Not even 30 seconds later a guy comes by to give us our dinner. We both said that it's what we ordered but no way it was ours as we had literally just ordered 30 seconds prior. The food runner said \"well do you want it now or hold off a little?\"  We asked for more time and the entree came as we finished our app. Obviously not our food when it came to us the first time (probably a entree that they didn't mean to make and were trying to just get it out).   Super disappointing and really put a sour on the evening. We finished our food and quickly paid. Not the bartenders fault, she was nice but I'm not sure if I'll be back",

I left my purse, with my license, credit cards, cash, and a few sizable gift cards, behind at the restaurant. I didn't realize it until today, and called in a panic. The staff had found it and put it in a safe location for me to pick up. Every single item was in my purse when I retrieved it. If you want to support a restaurant that has delicious food and has honest, hard working, friendly employees, then Superica is your ideal choice. Thanks Michael and team.

I liked that you could mix and match the tacos for variety. I had 2 wood grilled chicken tacos which is basically chicken fajita meat and 1 fried shrimp taco.  My order came out wrong but it was quickly corrected. I had a corn tortilla shell for one with was horrible. Me nor my boyfriend liked the corn tortillas. For the other 2 I had the puffy shell which wasn't what I expected. My boyfriend raved about the hard taco shell and said it was the best he's ever had!   The tacos were good, not great. I hate to say this but I prefer Chipotle's better.   So I likely won't return. The vibe was awesome. I was just underwhelmed at the food.",

I have never in my life been treated with such disrespect and lies. I approached the front desk and was told there was a 3 hour wait although there were numerous open tables. I asked about the open tables and was told I could leave if I didn't want to wait. I asked for a manger in which the person standing next to the hostess was represented by \"the manger\". He did not tell me his name and told me I could leave. I think your organization is a horrendous excuses for a professional business and the front of house staff needs a major overhaul. I work directly next door and am very sad you have chose people like this to represent your brand. You could do much better.",

They even have some creepy crawlers for your kids to see while you wait for your table (Don't worry, its enclosed in a habitat).  One of my favorite aspects is that they had a lunch special. For $11ish, you can pick 2 from the list below: -NACHOS -ENCHILADA (choose: Cheese, Picadillo, Mole, Chicken Verde, Chicken Suizas, or Vegetable) -HARD SHELL TACO (Picadillo, Chicken Tinga, or Guacamole with lettuce, tomato, and cheese) -SALAD -SOUP (cup of Chicken Tortilla Soup or Pozole Verde) -TACO AL CARBON (pork carnitas with guava glaze, grilled chicken, or steak, with smoked onions on flour tortillas)  Is that a deal or what?! Definitely a great spot for your mid day lunch crunch.",

    "text": "Great trendy Tex Mex!  I enjoyed Superica's puffy taco dinner.  I did not enjoy so much trying to gracefully eat it because it suffers from a plating issue.  A little larger plate would be nice so it doesn't feel as if the accoutrements piled high on the tacos are going to wind up all over the table :(   I did mention to our server as well so looking forward to this being rectified.  The potatoes that come w/the Carne Asada are huge wedge fries.  This makes them really soft in the inside w/no crunch.  If you like soft potatoes more like a cut up baked potato this is your jam.   Be prepared when ordering the guacamole taco it is literally guacamole on a taco shell.  The ground beef was seasoned well.  I would have liked a little sour cream on the side for the tacos.  I enjoyed the decor :)  Fair warning for Tex Mex this will shoot your grocery budget for the week!",

I parked three blocks away and walked. The interior is beautiful - from the exposed brick to the high ceilings to the cool bathrooms (including the leather sign details). Also, every employee we interacted with was really nice, which is a plus.   Where this spot was less than stellar to me was the food. Chips and salsa were just okay to me. There was a weird residue on the chip that I didn't totally love (I know everyone raves about their queso, but we didn't order any). I thought the salsas were okay but nothing too amazing. We each ordered different variations of the lunch special. I had the chicken suizas enchilada and a soft steak taco. The enchilada was better than the taco mainly because of execution. The taco came with onions and the onions were mostly raw. I think they would've tasted better carmalized. The bottomless rice and beans were pretty good.   Overall, I thought this spot was good but not great. I wouldn't pick it as a spot to come back to on my own but if a friend wanted to come here, I wouldn't necessarily be opposed.",

We ordered the Queso to go along with the chips and love it! I don't eat meat so I didn't opt to add that in but it still has a great, rich flavor! And the chips are yummyyy.   Their menu is slightly limited and a little funky. I've only ever ordered tacos ... little overpriced and a little difficult to modify. They don't really give you many options and are kind of strict on mix/matching. However, all entrees come with rice and beans that are bottomless. Cool concept but it can be a little annoying having to ask for more frequently.   Margaritas have been hit or miss for me.. one of them I literally had to have the waiter pour sprite in it because the sours were wayyy too strong.   Atmosphere here is very fun, trendy, and unique! Its a perfect spot for dinner with friends, date night, or family brunch (I've done all 3 haha).   Overall, I really like it. But, I wish they had a few more options and weren't so limited in mixing the taco selections.",

That was TRULY enough food for two people!  AND they'll bring you more beans, rice, and fixins as you need them... no muss, no fuss, no extra charge! Their drink menu was pretty good, and I was pleased to see a rose hard cider as I kinda wanted to try one!... it was yummy! :) I probably could've used a wheelbarrow to get to my car after dinner as the waitress conned us into sharing (4 ways) their decadent tres leches... I was stuffed to bursting!!  It was a little more expensive than I'd hoped, but that's never stood between me and meal with friends... this place is a nice addition to South End!",

The wait was quite long but we were able to grab two spots at the bar. Even though the bartender was extremely busy she was very sweet, helpful, and attentive. We ordered the hot house cocktail and OG margarita. They were both strong and yummy. After the first round she made us a custom cucumber jalapeno drink which was amazing. To eat we ordered queso fundido, el lopez, and tacos de camarones. The queso fundido was thick and very salty. I loved the tortillas but wasn't a fan of the greasiness and saltiness. The Enchiladas, tacos, and puff taco that came with the el lopez were all amazing. They taste like familiar Tex Mex food but have their own identity still. The shrimp tacos were also very yummy. The rice and beans come as family style so they brought out a plate of each for us to share. I love this idea as I fell like so much rice and beans get wasted at Mexican restaurants and this solves it! If you want more, just ask and they will keep bringing it.   Overall, great night, great food!",

    "text": "First things first, definitely make a reservation or come eat here when it's not super busy. My friends and I came around 7:30 and the wait was about an hour and a half long for a table for 4 people. The good thing is that there's places you can walk to to kill time. They text you when the tables ready so you don't have to worry about rushing back.   Let's talk about atmosphere: I loved the decoration of this place and it's layout. They have cute plants everywhere and couches where you can sit and chill. There's a bar right when you walk in so if you are going to wait it's perfect.   Food and drinks: I got the O.G. Margarita ($9) and it was pretty good - smaller than I expected but you can definitely taste the alcohol so it's nice to know they didn't skimp out on that. The bartender recommended us to get the Deluxe Fajitas and share ($28). So we did, and it was great! It came with bacon wrapped shrimp, chicken, and beef. I would definitely recommend that dish. I'm a big fan of fajitas and this is up there. They give you a side of butter with the fajitas and it's a real game changer! The free chips and salsa were great too! The chips were fresh and crisps - not to salty and not to oily.   Service: Our waitress was great! She was so nice and friendly. I believe her name is Evan. She made sure our chips were refilled and always asked if we wanted more drinks. She was a complete sweetheart. We did wait pretty long for our food however, but that's out of her control.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Good food, good drinks, and good service! The only reason I gave is 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a little overpriced. I've had fajitas before with chicken, shrimp, and beef in a larger portion and better taste for less. The menu items are pricey as well. However, this is definitely more of a luxurious experience and feel.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I love Tex-Mex but this is not the place for it. They bring out chips and salsa. Cool. The salsa was a little bland. The chips were so salty I could barely eat them. I ordered Chicken Fajitas.. let's see how I can sum this up so it's not an essay... First, it comes out with with all the fixing. Maybe a tablespoon of guacamole, a half of a cup of sour cream on top of lettuce, and not even teaspoon of pico de Gallo. Now that I've seen that, I move on to the fajitas... onions and chicken.. so no peppers? Really.... I mean REALLY?! All this for $22. A little much for such little food. After that I decided to try a taco because, can you really eff that up? Apparently yes. I had the tacos de camarones. It came with shrimp so I thought you definitely can't mess that up. Wrong. The shrimp was horrible. The taco was so overwhelming with flavor. Normally a good thing but this was not the case. It was not good at all. That taco was roughly $4.50. Absurd. The only good thing about this place is the host was super friendly and the waitress was attentive.  To be honest, I should I have just gone to Fuzzy's Tex Mex or an authentic Mexican restaurant. I would have paid less and known my food would be good.  Oh well. I can say I've been here, I've tried it and I probably won't return.",

    "text": "I went to Superica on a Thursday evening around 6:15 for dinner.  There was a small wait for a table, but we (2 people) were able to grab the last two seats at the bar for immediate service.  The restaurant did fill up very quickly - by 7:00 there were probably 25+ people waiting for tables.  The bartender was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about all of the cocktails options and food recommendations.  For cocktails, we started with the Red Headed Stranger and The Highwayman.  Both were AWESOME.  After our cocktails, we switched to wine/beer.    The chips are served with 2 salsas made in-house.  A smoky salsa and a green avocado salsa - both were outstanding.  For an appetizer, we opted to try the campechana de mariscos - a tomato-based ceviche with octopus, crab, shrimp and avocado.  It was slightly sweet and oh so tasty.  This is definitely a repeat order!    For dinner, we ordered the whole red snapper and the vegetable fajitas with an addition of some chicken.  The red snapper was juicy and pulled easily from the bones.  The vegetable fajitas were amazing - they have a rich smoky flavor that is really unique.  Both are served with rice and beans and a side plate of lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacomole and flour tortillas.    The portions for the entrees are really large.  I would recommend ordering one appetizer and one entree to split between 2 people, or skip the appetizer and limit your chip intake!  This will also help keep your bill in-check, as the prices are a bit higher than expected for a tex-mex restaurant.    Overall, we LOVED our meal and look forward to checking out brunch next.",

Which is helpful since this place is always busy! The chips are made in house and are out of this world! They are thin and crispy and pack a lot of flavor! If you don't like spicy food then I recommend staying away from the salsas because both are spicy. But if you do love spicy food then you're going to love them! I ordered the veggie enchilada and it was delicious! Filled with yummy veggies like potatoes, mushrooms, corn etc. The dish came with rice and beans, one thing to note is it does not automatically come with vegetarian beans. My server pointed that out and I appreciated him asking if I would like black beans instead. Overall the food and pricing were great for what you got and anytime I'm craving Tex mex I'll be stopping here!",

    "text": "Very differs, very eclectic are the words I would use to describe this Tex-Mex restaurant. I'm not very use to Tex-Mex in general, but I get the feeling Superica does it well.   The decor is even Tex-Max Posh ( if that's a thing, I'm making it a thing ). Industrial/modern/western design, leather couches, interesting lighting and a large window . I think there may be a patio in the back . There is a bar and a dining area , in the front. Then towards the back there is more seating near the kitchen wear you can see orders coming up.  Our servers were great, made good suggestions and explained the menu well. We ordered chips that came with two types of salsa , not your traditional salsa, one was green due to being mixed with avocado and the other was dark red and spicy . We also order guacamole which was ok, came out already made with tostadas which where very salty.  For my entree I had chicken Souizas enchiladas . Rich , rich, rich . Tender shredded chicken covered in sour cream poblano sauce and Monterrey jack cheese ....a lot of it! It came in a either a small skillet or a very hot plate , I cannot remember . It also came with rice that I didn't eat because I was getting too full.   I'm interested in coming back at lunch to try more menu items , as well as drink menu items. Being that it's in South End , it's something you can walk to, and there's plenty of other things to do around it.",

Now i know you're thinking, Sunday brunch at a Mexican restaurant...but it was really good. Their pancakes are the size of a plate and taste as authentic as you mom making them. They have a homemade syrup, and when paired with butter you have a delicious sweet breakfast. The pancakes are a must try!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I had an amazing time here! We've heard the hype and finally decided to check it out on a Sunday night on the earlier side of dinner. No problem at all getting a table and we found that there were a good number of families there (read: family friendly) but not overly so that it detracted from the classy ambiance.   This place definitely is a step (or two) up from your usual Mexican joint. It's got an edgy industrial feel that fits well with South End and the prices are slightly higher than average Mexican. That being said, this isn't average.   Upon being seated, our waitress brought us a bowl of piping hot chips (perfectly salted) and two kinds of salsa. One is green tomatillo and mild and the other is a very dark red that she called \"spicy\" but I only have a mild tolerance and I thought it was nice. Both were unique and neither tomato-y. She also brought us refills of everything because we of course devoured it!  For my meal I ordered the veggie fajitas which appear pricey on the menu, but the portions on fajitas are always huge and I planned to get multiple meals out of it (I got 3 for reference). The veggies in it are so different than what you'd expect: purple cabbage, sweet potato, cauliflower, onions, and carrots roasted to perfection with a drizzle of a creamy yellow sauce. So much flavor! This came with brown rice and black beans. My husband ordered the mole chicken which I tried and also thought was very good.   As we were finishing our meal, the manager came over to chat, refreshed our drinks, and brought us to go boxes. He stopped back multiple times (in a non-annoying way) and even brought us a big of to-go chips and salsa to \"complete our meal\" of leftovers.   We departed full and happy!!",

It was an hour wait, but WELL worth the wait. We ordered the chicken fajita tacos and chicken/steak/shrimp fajita combo to share. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The complimentary chips and salsa were incredible as well. I believe our servers name was Holland (I'm terrible for not remembering because he was fantastic). He was very attentive and gave us honest recommendations, which did not steer us wrong. I was so impressed with the entire experience I almost couldn't wait to write this review. We've gone to a lot of new places in the area over the last few months that were hyped up and we left disappointed. Superica was an all around 11/10.",

Kim did a very good job as a server and asked if we needed help or recommendations. The food is a dollar or two above a typical Mexican spot more in line with Tex-Mex Paco's Tacos . My Pollo con Mole was very tasty with the sauce; however, I am not sure I had chicken, maybe beef/pork? lol. The \"chicken\" was not as delicious as the sauce. Loved the thin chips and house-made sauces-per Kim made fresh daily. Another plus is the bottomless beans and rice. Some places skimp on these very affordable carbs.They put love into their entrees and that's a good thing. Kids meals are generous and include a drink. Will try  these Lunch Specials for a feel of some of their other offerings. Also  will plan to take the rail in/ take a very early lunch.",

Well, last night my husband and I spent the whole night suffering from the nachos. And yes it was the nachos because it was the only item both of us shared and it was evident. So, after a night of hell, I don't think I'll ever feel safe eating from here again in fear of suffering a night of food poisoning again. Superica, you need to step up your game, change your menu, and make your food way better, y'all have a prime location yet the food is horrible and now may lead to food poisoning, so I'm good. I will not be going back ever again!",

    "text": "Great concept, nearly flawless execution! Food was fresh, unique, and que rico?! I was really impressed with the flavors incorporated into the various tacos (the shrimp dorado is obscenely tasty). I also had the Matador: a quirky tequila cocktail with pineapple, cilantro, and lime...absolutely delicious. Wait staff, on all fronts, was top notch; Pharoah undoubtedly made our experience one of a kind. Definitely give this joint a whirl if you enjoy tequila, Tecate, and tacos!",

    "text": "Damn, I love this place. Maybe it's the leftover tex-mex affinity I gathered from my time in Oklahoma, but Superica takes this and does it a step better. The puffy tacos are delicious and I can attest to the greatness of the queso fundido. They also keep some good local beers around, not just the standard OMB Copper etc. you see so many Charlotte places keep in an attempt to be local without offering anything out of the ordinary. You can ball out and get some of the great appetizer dips, but even the two salsas they bring for the table are fantastic - a fire roasted red and an avocado green (I'm partial toward the green). Tie that up with a beautiful southwestern interior and a nice western music mix and a tumbleweed-laden southwestern landscape on the big screen and yeah, it's going to be busy as all hell if you're there on the weekend and yeah, you have to find street parking, but Superica is worth it.",

The wait staff struggled a bit (most likely first time nervousness) but you can tell they are not used to carrying trays yet.   Food was excellent. I did receive a cup of salsa all over my pants from a server attempting to carry the tray, but after that the food was really good (short rib).   The manager did come by after the salsa spill and tell us he'd bring margaritas, but I was a little surprised to see it charged on our bill. Drinks are delicious but a little smaller than a traditional Mexican restaurant.   All in all, good to try and really good food, but I think they might have some growing pains until they get things rolling.",

We ordered guacamole and it was delicious. We liked that it came with tostadas. I ordered the Matador margarita and it was unique and delicious. My girlfriend ordered Tommy's Margarita and really liked it. We both thought they could be served in larger glasses. I ordered the Chili Relleno and it was awesome! My girlfriend got the Shrimp Tacos Dorados and loved them. We love this place and will definitely be back! Great atmosphere, food, drinks, and service. Doesn't even compare to the other South End Tex mex restaurants - it's the best!",

    "text": "One word Yummy! Mexican and Tex Mex is my favorite type of food. I have been here now in NC for 4 months and still trying out different places to eat. This place stands out above all Mexican places starting with their chips and salsa. Chips are fresh and lightly salted. I could not get enough. They bring with it their own recipe of salsa. Very tasty just right! If you want alittle bit spicer, they have some extra sauce on the table for you. They think of everyone! Plus they have a creamy very tasty avocado sauce for your chips to try. Delicious! Free too! I ordered Traditional Steak Fajitas. Tones of fresh, large strips of skirt steak with all the toppings. Came with beans. Not a real fan so I asked for rice instead. No problem the waitress said. Rice was moist, fresh and tasty too. Husband ordered Steak Tacos. He loved them! Place is clean and decorated very cool. Staff very nice and efficient. I can not wait to go back.",

    "text": "Took my family of seven here for lunch; the hostess was very attentive to my seating preference and our waiter Marquis provided the best table service I have ever had in my entire life's experience dining in Charlotte.  We all had the lunch special with a variety of choices:  nicely browned/cheesy enchiladas, tender chicken verde enchiladas, and a very keto friendly and flavorful pozole verde soup with pork rinds floating on top and a huge side salad option.  The chips and multiple salsas were delicious, fresh and unique.  The atmosphere is young and fun but not too loud and this is our new favorite spot to walk to in our Dilworth/South End neighborhood.  The tequila shots are generous in size but start at $8; they have $6 Hop Drop and Roll IPA drafts which is a pretty good deal.  The location is also an easy walk from the East/West Blvd. light rail station.",

    "text": "My new favorite in Charlotte. We drove by on Saturday evening and there was a lot of people waiting for a seat, which is a good sign but we did not feel like waiting. So we went today (Sunday) around 4pm and did not have a wait. The service was a bit delayed with drinks but I expected this because of the other reviews. However it did not bother me because it is a brand new restaurant and of course you will have a few rough spots in the beginning. The wait for our food was short and the food was AMAZING, I mean it was perfection! Our server was such a doll. We tried the Parilla deluxe, Flautas, and the Queso Fundido. Definitely some of the best food I have ever had in Charlotte. So excited to have this excellent restaurant in our city! Thank you Superica for coming to the Southend and knocking us off our feet. I really was hesitant about posting this review because I would rather keep this place a secret!!!!!",

Whatever they tell you about the wait add about 30 minutes to. The drinks are good and the food is great. We ordered 6 different meals and 2 desserts and everything was good. Chips and salsa as well as the queso with chorizo was amazing - must order. I would definitely recommend this place but don't go when you're in a rush.",

    "text": "Went for a late lunch today with friends. It was not initially my choice because of friends that went two weeks ago, received slow and poor service only to have their entire meal comped. They also specified that the price point was a little high for the food. Still, I'll give anywhere a chance. Unfortunately, my visit confirmed the poor service and the high price point. The restaurant really should have $$$. $11.99 lunch special for two items (I had enchiladas) plus \"family style\" rice and beans. While the food was good, the price point was about $2-3 too high. We went at the tail end of the lunch rush so kitchen volume was low but still didn't get the appetizer until we reminded staff twice (which was then comped). We also had to ask for the craft beer twice only to have the response be the name of a brewery and not the kind of beer so had to ask a third time (bartender and server issue especially at the end of lunch). On the whole, I can't recommend the restaurant and do not plan to return. It pains me because I love TexMex food and usually complimentary to any good restaurant (as can be seen from my other reviews). Charlotte also has some good TexMex but could alway use more. While the restaurant is new, if the service doesn't improve then I think it will struggle. 2 stars only because the taste of the food was decent.",

He asked us if it was our first time, which it was, and gave us a quick rundown of the menu- not over-the-top - just enough information. Drinks were good. We got the chili con queso with chorizo- it was decent- a little thinner than queso at Mexican restaurants- next time I think we'll try the queso fundido. The food was pretty good - I never really have high expectations of Tex Mex food but Superica was on point. The only place I've had better Tex Mex was at Rocco's Taco down in South Florida. We got a fajita dish with chicken- seasoned very well, bacon-wrapped shrimp- amazing, and steak- only complaint here is it was cook all the way through. Not a big deal though as most steak fajitas are usually thin - there's was thicker and other places they're cooked-through. We definitely had left overs too. We'll be back for sure!! Ohh and that frothed garlic butter, yum!!!",
