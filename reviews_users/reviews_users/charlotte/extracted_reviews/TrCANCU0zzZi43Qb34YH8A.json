It was unlike any I have had before. Absolutely delicious!!  My husband had the Wiener schnitzel. The portion was huge and it was delicious. My Four Cheese Ravioli was excellent as well.

Then the apple cobbler was way undercooked with most of the apples tasting like they were raw- not exactly what you expect with a cobbler.  I have eaten here on many other occasions and been pleased with both he service and food.

They advertise a 3-course supper on the blackboard outside the restaurant, on their website and in the restaurant which lured us in. However, when we sat down, we were told that because there was only 2 of us, we would have to pay double the advertised price. Nowhere does it say this - and I went back and reviewed the aforementioned places (see picture). Needless to say, we did not order the Sunday Supper and instead ordered a few items that were advertised as part of that meal - e.g. crispy shrimp and calamari, margherita pizza, etc. It tasted ok not great but we will NEVER go back to this restaurant due to its deceptive advertising. Only when we went to pay for the bill was there any mention of the Sunday Supper being for parties of 4 or more. Too bad because this would have been a nice \"go to\" restaurant for its convenient location.  One further comment - we expected to be able to make one selection from each of the 3 courses and the explanation from our server was that you received all listed choices for the Sunday Supper. Never heard of this before - and there should be an option for 2 people for a slimmed down meal.",

I prefer my poke either chopped fine or at least chopped into small pieces, the was actually good so the larger chunks were ok with us. For our main course we split a BBQ chicken pizza. When it arrived the crusr was literally charded or more correctly burned. Since i love the crust, this was a big deal to me. My wife not so much. When the waitress finally returned i told her the crust was burned , she took a glance and laughed, I see that, she said, \"those boys in kitchen, they have a tendency to burn things from time to time. She chuckled again snd left our table. I literally wanted to hurl the plate of pizza like \"foodfight\" in Animal House. I however, refrained, paid by bill and left. I will never be back to this place. Its mediocre at best. The burned pizza was the last straw for us. If you have low expectations or are just desperate to eat then go on in, anything else, seek a better meal elswhere. SEE PICS OF CHARRED PIZZA.",

Instead of being all about pizzas, they've expanded their menu to include other food options.  The interior space hasn't changed, still a really cool, dim-lit, restaurant... but what is coming out of the kitchen is new.  No worries though, they still have pizza on the menu and it is still very delicious.  After having a beer, we did split a pizza and it was well worth it.  Servers and waitstaff are really keen here... I totally didn't catch the fact they closed at 10pm on a weeknight... and we got there around 9:40ish.... but they did not mention anything until the bartender wanted to get our last-call drinks.  Even when we left, there was still a large table seated and a couple booths still occupied, but I still felt a little bad for making the restaurant \"stay open\" longer than it was agreed upon on their operating hours.",

Even though it's in Philips Place, it's NOT pretentious at all. I love good food but can't stand some of the restaurants in Southpark that are so snobby. We've eaten here about 6 times now and have tried the steak, beef burger, turkey burger when it was on the menu, meatballs, Wiener schnitzel, salads, pizza and chicken burger. Never a bad meal and always great service.   They have a great selection of wines and I've had the cocktail with bourbon, maple syrup and mint. It was delicious but the cocktails are pricey. I think about $13. Out of everything we have tried, the chicken bacon burger is the hands down favorite. They grind the bacon along with the chicken so that the burger stays moist and has a smoked flavor throughout. Husband and I both ordered it tonight because it's just that good. He gets it with their incredible fries and I ask for a side salad to be health conscious ( yes I know, ground bacon isn't healthy but it is delicious!!)  This place is comfortable but still hip looking and has a beautiful BIG bar area that I love but somehow the place is still kid-friendly. (The pizza is SO GOOD) I don't have kids and not a fan of paying for a meal to be surrounded by kids running wild. I haven't seen that here. There is a small outdoor seating area that I believe is heated in the winter.  Anyway, I wrote this big review because the overall reviews when I looked it up on Yelp was 3.5 and I am in shock. We've eaten here enough times to have a good sense of the place and we've walked away happy every time. Ignore the bad reviews and give this place a try.",

The third time we walked in on a Monday - they weren't that busy and my husband and I sat at the bar.  The bartender never acknowledged us - there were only two other people at the bar. I finally asked for a wine list and it took another 10 minutes for him to return. I ordered a beet salad that had no protein on it - no chicken, steak or seafood and it was $15.00. When it came out it was so small, I thought the bartender made a mistake and gave me a side salad instead. Sorry - I won't be returning.",

We started off with calamari that was cooked perfectly and the sauce that goes with it was nice.  The kids got cheese pizzas.  We would have been good with them ordering one and splitting as the kids pizza was big - note my kids are under 10.  My husband and I got small salads - he the Cesar and I the apple and blue cheese.  Both were very large portions and a great value.   We ordered the mushroom and truffle pizza and it was awesome.  The crust and flavors were great.  I also got the grilled octopus ( what can I say I like octopus ). It was also wonderful.   Service was a little spotty.  I believe our server was tasked with too many tables.  He was nice enough however.  Definitely would return.",

    "text": "As Johnny V. said, I was expecting a little more from the new WP Kitchen & Bar menu.  We stopped in for lunch on a Monday afternoon, and they had a sign on the door, opening at 12:30 due to inclement weather, although Charlotte didn't get any of the storms expected.  Needless to say we waited ten minutes for the doors to open. Once seated our waiter arrived with water and was very sweet and friendly. He gave us several minutes to look over the menu and answered some questions regarding some of the selections. We decided to go with sandwiches, which may have been our fault.  We chose the Turkey Club and Burger.  The Burger by far was worth it, although the bacon aioli was missing a lot of the bacon flavor. As for the club, it was good, but there was so much focaccia bread it overwhelmed the entire sandwich. And, like the aioli on the burger, the aioli on the sandwich had no flavor, very bland I actually added a little salt.  The fries and chips, are two sides, were good. I would say the chips are light and crisp, a nice treat. Overall, lunch was good, but nothing great.  I will definitely be back to give the pizzas another try, as I remember really enjoying them in the past.",

    "text": "We really liked this place when it was Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar and had every intention of getting our usual pizzas when we walked in the other evening, only to find that everything had changed!  Well, not EVERYTHING, but some very important things.  The layout of the place is essentially the same and we didn't realize anything had changed until we sat down and looked at a menu.  What used to be a menu stocked full of good pizzas like the roasted mushroom is now a menu with small plates, Italian dishes, and a much-condensed pizza list with a lesser version of my old favorite.  One thing that hasn't changed is the $7/pint draft beers!    With the reality of the new menu setting in, we were strongly urged (a bit too strongly if you ask me) to order some small plates to get started as this appears to be the new focus.  We got some calamari and a salad to share.  Both were tasty but not memorable.  We also got a couple of pizzas, I went with the mushroom which was fine but not as good as the prior one.    On its own merit without considering what it used to be, this place is fine but not outstanding.  You have the valet option which is strongly recommended as parking is horrid.  You have the long waits if you don't make reservations.  You have the pretty good wait staff which is now laser focused on getting customers to try the new dishes.  You have a solid and well-rounded menu, some nice wine, beer, and cocktail options.  And you have the large bill at the end.    We used to drive out of our way to go here but probably won't anymore.  It's pretty good but there is no longer anything that stands to me.  We miss the old Pizza Bar....",

So you had to sit there and read through the entire menu.   The interior did not change. So I expected the food to be new and exciting. I had hope...  The fried calamari was average! Similar to a place like applebees except maybe applebees has a better crisp to em. The aioli was heavy on the creamy side. It was a uninspired fried dish.   The mac and cheese was probably the worst. The inside was luke warm, pasta was very firm. It tasted like they just had it already made for a while then nuked it in the microwave before serving. The crisp on top was raw- it looked like raw bread crumbs- no dark browning at all.   I would not reorder these items.  I would reorder the smoked salmon bruschetta. There was a pleasant amount of crisp, fresh mixed veggies atop my thinly sliced smoked salmon.   I enjoyed the service. They always get that part right.  But WP is a very safe restaurant. Their food is decent. The choices/offerings are not very exciting tho.  Very middle of the road.",

The Hummus was delicious.  My pizza had no cheese on it, no firm/crispy crust and just wasn't very good.  I attempted to eat the pizza by holding a slice and all ingredients slid off because crust was too soft.  I had one slice and had to eat it with a fork.  The chicken burger was inedible secondary to too much salt.  I gave 2 stars because they did admit the food sucked and comped it, the hummus was good, and good wine.",

    "text": "I had Saturday lunch plans with my mother at Cafe Monte, but when we arrived we were told we'd have a 45 minute wait. Bordering on hangry, we turned ourselves around and headed to WP. I hadn't been since the rebrand and wanted to scope out the differences.  To be honest, I couldn't determine that much had changed from the Pizza Bar days -- but that's not a bad thing. I always enjoyed my visits before, and this one would be no different.  We were seated immediately. Our server was kind and very professional. I ordered the Turkey Bolognese with Basil Whipped Ricotta, and asked that it be made gluten free. My mother ordered the special; an open-faced sandwich and side salad. A manager brought our dishes, and upon glancing at mine I already knew it looked too good to be True. I spoke up, \"I'd just like to confirm that my dish is gluten free?\" Her eyes widened and she quickly removed the plate, explaining that she would have a new one out directly. She came back with our server, both apologizing profusely. The server had made the note but the kitchen didn't see it. No harm done -- I hadn't started eating. My correct dish came out a few moments later.  There aren't a lot of places in Charlotte where I can get good GF pasta. Not only were the noodles good, but the turkey sauce was delightful and the basil whipped ricotta alone was worth the price of the dish. I could have eaten it straight with a spoon. Delicious.  About the service -- we were well taken care of during our meal, but what really struck me was the thoughtfulness of our hostess. While we were eating, it started raining heavily. We hadn't prepared for a shift in the weather, and noticing this, the hostess mentioned that we could borrow umbrellas for our walk through the parking lot. I was able to zip back in to return them and we went about our afternoon much more comfortable than if we had been drenched due to our poor planning. It was a wonderful gesture.  I also wanted to include a note from my previous visits. Back in the Pizza Bar days, I went with a friend and ordered the Artisanal Cheese & Salume Board. I asked if there was anything the kitchen could do to accommodate for my gluten free diet -- thinking they'd put a few extra apples or cucumbers on the plate for me to enjoy with my cheese. Instead, they sliced up a few GF pizza crusts for me that I was able to treat like flatbread. I was so pleasantly surprised. Any time the kitchen and service staff can make me feel a little more normal despite my dietary restrictions, they've won me as a loyal customer.",

We were greeted at the door immediately and warmly, shown to our seats right away, and our server never let our water glasses go down.   As far as atmosphere- it's a nice open and airy atmosphere. It was a bit dark inside, so you may need to use your light on your phone to read the menu if you have issues with seeing.  Also be aware that it is not the best atmosphere for people who are hard of hearing. The music + people talking made for a noisy atmosphere. This is probably not your best choice if you're looking for a quiet dinner.  Overall, I'd eat here again- just probably not with my family since they all have hearing problems! Haha",

Then I ordered the octopus small plate and holy cow, it was amazing. Not chewy at all, nicely charred and just the right portion size. My friend had the Weiner Schnitzel that he said tasted good, although one really has to be okay eating a breaded and fried thin piece of meat to truly enjoy it... :) The ambience of the restaurant was lovely, noise level just right.  I didn't give 5 stars bc server flubbed my order twice, but she was so personable and it was such a nice evening, it's not like it ruined anything.  I would go back in a minute.",

One of the worst meals I've had at a restaurant.",

When you first walk in you see the huge bar (they've got craft cocktails), which sits in the middle of the casual/elegant dining room. Whether it's for dinner or lunch, request a booth if you can.  In the chilly weather, my favorite to start out with is a cup of Squash soup: chunks of roasted pumpkin, with cardamom cream and pumpkin oil on top.   Salad wise: the NC Apple Salad has a ton of thin apple slices on it, which i love! It comes with buttermilk blue cheese, frisee, arugula, radicchio, candied walnuts, and is tossed in a sherry vinaigrette.  Pasta: Trofie. It's one of the pricier on the menu but when you taste it you won't regret the splurge! This pasta tossed with braised lamb, tomato, roasted sweet onions, porcini mushroom, and a cured egg yolk.",

    "text": "We finally decided to try out this restaurant since the movies were ideally located nearby, at the Phillips Place.  Main complaint right off the bat.  The restaurant was poorly air conditioned, and it was muggy as hell, especially where we were seated...a booth by the bar, near the door.  It was also quite loud where we were seated...and strangely so, because it really wasn't that crowded.  The noise may have been primarily from the loud TV screens blasting sports, of course.  The decor itself is fairly generic...more casual and rugged, than chic or elegant. The food itself was mediocre...yet overpriced for what it was.  Although I liked the pizza crust, the pie (the one I ordered was \"Fennel Sausage\") itself was almost hard to digest in that it was way too spicy...and not in a good way.  It almost looked like they just dumped a ton of hot peppers and sauce on the pie.  Honestly, it tasted awful.  Also, the body of the pie was flimsy thin and wet (with red sauce?)...and just NOT GOOD.  I actually ordered this \"Fennel Sausage\" after seeing a picture of it on their website...but as you'll see, it looked nothing like what's pictured on the website!  Honestly, I feel as if I've been scammed or something lol.  BTW, my husband had the Chipotle BBQ Chicken pie, and he seemed to like it OK at best; and my son didn't seem too thrilled with his Chicken and Bacon Burger.  Luckily, we were all so famished by the time we got our food that we managed to eat them all.  Anyway, back to my pie.  For a fairly small, badly prepped, overspiced pizza, it seemed overpriced.  I expected so much more from a \"Wolfgang Puck\" pizza...but fell very short.  I will say that the service was good on the most part...no major complaints there.  Still, overall, NOT worth it.  We've had much better pizza (and burgers) at half the price.",

Excellent selection of beverages and cocktails, paired with a wonderful bartender. He made the perfect extra dirty martini for my friend. So pleased!! I again enjoyed an OMB Copper. It's best on draft so I'd rather enjoy it when I'm out and about. Our waitress was on point. She greeted us in a timely manner, had our calamari out so fast it's as if she read our minds, and while she was incredibly attentive, she also let us enjoy the company of each other without too many interruptions.  The calamari was perfectly seasoned, not rubbery at all and the grilled fresh lemon for drizzling was exactly what I wanted! We ordered the K+B Burger and Margarita Pizza for entrees. My friend LOVED the burger and the 'onion jelly', his words, that was spread on the bottom bun. He stuffed himself trying to finish it because he couldn't get enough. The fries paired with the burger were crisp and salted to perfection. Truly delicious.  I ordered and thoroughly enjoyed he margarita pizza. Few places add it to the menu and even fewer do it right. Not too much mozzarella and it was prepared so well I didn't feel like I was choking when trying to eat. Some restaurants really over do it and then don't cook the cheese well so it's lumped in your throat as you eat.  We did not choose to get dessert but the app and entrees were so good, I don't think this sweet tooth missed too much (at least I hope not!!).",

The PEI mussels were \"some of the best we've ever had\".  Pasta was excellent, salads large and diverse in flavors. Pizza was thin crust and tasty! It's all good here and we will be back.",

    "text": "WP kitchen +bar has been a staple in Phillips Place for decades. And I have been going to this restaurant for years. But last night's dinner was proof that it continues to slide down into the large range of restaurants that offer really bad service and barely decent food for an overpriced bill. I have loved this restaurant- it has been on my go to places for really good meals. Last night was a huge disappointment. The service was atrocious, and the manager would walk around and just greet people in a creepy way. Didn't offer to help anyone that I could tell. As if saying hi to the customers was going to win people over. The food was a mixed bag. Some loved their meals - which is why I gave two starts for the mixed food. And some food was nearly inedible. Please WP Kitchen- try your own food and then take the meals that completely suck off the menu!",

That makes it a top kid-friendly option if you want to take your whole family out, but really compromises (as my wife and I discovered on our Friday date night) the restaurants strength as a date night spot if you want three hours away from kids. That's about the only negative here, though. The food is excellent and served hot an instantaneously. The mixed drinks are weak but not as bad as some other local places. Stand out choices include the NC Apple Salad, which is one of the best salads I've ever had, any of the pizzas, and the fish dishes. The calamari, however, is a NO GO.",

    "text": "It actually pains me to write this review. I want to preface my below comments by saying that this is mine and my husband's favorite restaurant  & favorite GOTO on Sundays.  last Sunday's  Food, Service, and Management was right out horrible and would go down in our history of eating in Charlotte these past 7 months as the worst all around experience!  The only good thing about the evening was our poor Server Nathan who is new to the restaurant.  We ordered the 2  appetizer portion of mussels  and 1 appetizer portion of the octopus. His came out on a flat plate dry as the Sahara with none of the broth and 2 wedges of grilled bread points .  His Octopus was so cold , tough and rubbery.  My husband complained to the waiter.  Who also was upset about the food.  My mussels also came  out on a plate with so much \"tomato\" \"sauce\" and a pound of garlic.  The sauce was so thick, salty and pasty.  I ate 3 pcs and my tongue burned so bad from all the garlic & salt, I had to return it.    The manager finally  comes over, mind you she never came over to see how we were doing. In a restaurant with 6 tables occupied so they were not busy.   Maybe because she was busy hanging with her friends by the bar and kitchen maybe that is what she was unaware of the crap coming out of her kitchen!    Let's just say her approach was curt and lacked empathy.  She came from behind me speaking to me and the words that came out of her mouth... \"WOULD YOU LIKE US TO FIRE YOU UP ANOTHER ORDER OF MUSSELS?\"  That pissed me off!  If the cook didn't get it right the first 2x why would it be right the third time.  She didn't say \"I'm sorry for your experience , how can I make it right....\"  No acknowledgement or regards for the crap she and her kitchen staff served that night.  Let's just say it will be a while before we eat there again!  When we do it will only be when Stephen the other Manager who works there and actually cares about the food, customers , and the customers' experience!",

What made the experience even better was how great the service was. Caroline was our server and she was absolutely fantastic! Her knowledge of the menu and recommendations were unmatched.

The restaurant is located in a lovely shopping center. Parking was slim, but there is valet if you like. We opted to sit outside, because it was a little noisy inside, but it was kind of hot and there were a ton of flies so I probably wouldn't recommend that.  We started with the BBQ shrimp, NOLA style, which was delicious. I could have drank a bowl of the broth the shrimp were in! For my entree I got the truffled mushroom pizza, which was just fabulous with goat cheese and baby spinach. I enjoyed it so much!  The service was great, and I'm only sorry I was too full to try dessert!",

WP Kitchen scored a solid 4-stars with all in our party of four (two of us even gave it a 5, except my burger was overcooked and lacked flavor).  Our server, Brian, was exactly what we were in the mood for:  someone laid back, not pushy, and mostly out of sight until we need him.  Thanks, Brian!  We basically ordered two entrees:  two of us ordered the burger and the other two ordered the trout.  Let's just say the trout aced the burgers with them both moaning and groaning about how good it was.  Almost embarrassingly like the scene in Katz's Deli straight out of \"Harry Loves Sally.\"  I'll have what they're having, LOL.  Get a room.    For burgers, delectable trout, a couple bottles of wine, apps, and drinks at the bar, as a group we laid out over $300, but then the Yelp 30% food discount kicked in.  We gave it to Brian for attending to us so well.  I say \"Give 'em a whirl\" when in South Park.  Nice, laid back place to chill with good friends, good food, good drink, and memorable times.",

We popped in for Sunday brunch, our server greeted us with half off Bloody Marys and Mimosas, stop, you had me at hello.  We ordered the NC Apple Salad, with bleu cheese and candied walnuts. It was a perfectly balanced salad. It was a wave of flavors with every bite. Our server was very pleasant, he did not have the Sunday blues.  And again I left thinking I need to eat here more often and I must write my Yelp review. Done and done.",

    "text": "I like their high ceiling and decent interior of this restaurant. The food is good. It is not cheap but affordable. You might think some of dishes are over priced because of the name value of the restaurant. Tuna tartare as an appetizer was very fresh and the chip which came with was crispy and thin. They didn't add a lot of sauce on tuna so you can taste fresh tuna. For main dishes, kitchen burger was good. Guess it was char grilled and enjoyed smoked patty of the burger. Liked thin french fries that came with! Their popular Wiener Schnitzel was a type of crispy pork cutlet(it was said veal on the menu but server informed us that it got changed to pork in advance.) I expected something special on the sauce, sour potatoes that came with but it was just okay. But they cooked pork well like crispy and tender. The service was good and liked the meal overall.",

Out of the 4 times I visited I had the pleasure of having Scott from Philly as my server and he's was amazing.  He covers the bar and tables around it, I never had to ask for my iced tea refill.  He was always friendly and attentive and you will be very happy to have him or anyone else help serve your meal and drinks.  The food choices are large and I have had the brussel sprouts, salmon, meatballs, chopped salad - all were prepared perfectly.  Love, LOVED the brussel sprouts.  I have to try the pizzas as they looked very tasty.  The decor and atmosphere is claiming and there is also outside seating if it is not too hot.  I love the location which is right next to the Hampton Inn were I stayed so easy walk to and from.  You will not be disappointed visiting this establishment for the food, service and friendly staff.  A must try in my book.",

I ordered the crab cakes with a side of roasted potatoes. She ordered the shrimp and calamari. The presentation for the calamari was the cutest. We both enjoyed our drinks I ordered the tropical storm which our waiter mentioned that particular drink was only for special days but he still went out of his way to make sure he was able to get the bartender to fix this specialty drink for me. We ate outside on the patio we came here early so their was literally no people here yet as we arrived. I would like to think that the service is always great here being that we both could not stop raving about the customer service here from our waiter, the management, and bartender. Love this place and glad I finally got a chance to come.",

    "text": "We were very pleasantly surprised!  My wife and I had seen this place and it always looked a bit quiet.  We were running errands in the area and decided to give it a shot.  We shared 3 items:  A NY apple salad, a meatball appetizer and a side of mac and cheese.  The salad was fresh and well composed.  The meatballs were delicious and the mac and cheese rivaled what I make at home (and have spent many years adjusting to get it right).    We had a bit of a sweet tooth, so we shared a chocolate tart that must have had 5 or 6 components on the plate... a chocolate caramel tart with a pecan crust, a chocolate sauce with darkly toasted nuts, shards of a nut brittle, bourbon gelato and some crazy fluffy stuff that our waiter said was \"very cold powdered sugar\" (the flavor and behavior was  spot on for that, but it was oddly fluffy and crispy at the same time... never seen anything like it).  It was a tremendous desert.  The service was a tad bit slow (I'm nit picking), but the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Several tables came in at once, immediately followed by a party taking up the front of the house, so I've gotta cut them some slack and they kept it moving pretty well given the lumpy arrivals.",

There was a large group about to be seated on the patio so this was great considering we were headed to a movie.  (We were able to get our order in and still have plenty of time to walk to the theater.)  Enjoyed the calamari and Margherita pizza.  The crust on the pizza was crispy and the marinara sauce was delicious.  They was also an ample amount which is how I like my pizza.  WP will be my go to for classy casual and next time I'm going to a movie in Phillips Place.",

We made sure they closed at 10 , with the host, as soon as we walked in because we didn't want to be THOSE people. Sat down at the bar and the bartender asked us if we were going to eat to which we replied 'maybe' because honestly we were more interested in cocktails. Bartender tosses menus in front of us and says 'kitchen closes in 15 minutes and we close in 20' COME ON NOW DUDE. I know what that means, we looked at cocktail selections for maybe 60 seconds more, in which, during that time the bartender was slamming things around and I can hear him swearing under his breath. Boo dude, boo! We left. He clearly didn't was us there so we didn't want to stay. Cool location, normally pretty decent service but this bartender just turned us off to the whole thing.",

I arrived early and walked in at 11:10am.  It is very chilly in charlotte today and was happy to find a warm spot.  A gentleman sitting at the bar turned around and looked at me like \"what are you doing here?\" And then reminded the hostess(like I am not standing right there) that they do not open until 11:30.  She then repeated what I just heard him say??  I get it that you don't open until 11:30, but if your front door is open and someone walks in (with less than 20 minutes to wait) wouldn't you say \"we don't start serving lunch until 11:30, but we would be happy to seat you and get you a drink\". There are too many great restaurants in Charlotte now to go to ones that don't appreciate customers.  I left and met my friend a Cafe Monte which is right around the corner and always delicious, friendly and packed with happy customers.",
