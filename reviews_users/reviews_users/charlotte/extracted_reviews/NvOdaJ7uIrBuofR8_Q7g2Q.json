    "text": "Just off the main intersection of Trade and Tryon, Newk's is conveniently located to grab a quick lunch. They have multiple sandwich, soup and salad options, as well as kids meals and a plethora of side dishes.   I went right after noon on a Wednesday and the place was ridiculously packed. Good thing I was just grabbing something to go or I would have had to wait for a table. If you're in a hurry, there is a refrigerated section that allows you to grab a sandwich or salad, getting you out the door in just a couple of minutes. You can also pre-order your food online so you don't have to wait around....   As I was not aware of those options, I got in the long line to order a chicken salad sandwich with fruit. The order line went fairly quickly, but then we had to wait 15 minutes in a huge crowd of people for food. Better idea to order ahead next time.   The sandwich was enormous and very good. Fruit is a fruit salad of grapes, cantaloupe and green melon - tough to mess that up. All in all this is a good place to stop and grab something for lunch to take back to your desk. Be sure to pre-order online, though, or you'll be waiting awhile for your food.",

    "text": "Newk's was a reminder of why I should do my due diligence on Yelp even when I am in a hurry. I had it confused with Mert's and by the time I glanced at the menu and discovered my error I was already inside and in the line of sight of the cashier.  I opted for the Shrimp Po' Boy which came in at a touch over $10 without a drink. It wasn't bad, per say, certainly the shrimp were good and the bread was enjoyable, but I must say the fact that my little sea friends weren't breaded or fried was a bit of a let down.  The sandwich was red onion-heavy and relied a lot on the sauces that went with, one remoulade and one cocktail sauce.  My sandwich came with a side so I opted for \"fresh fruit\" and was given fruit salad which, while technically correct, was a bit of a surprise.  Newk's should probably actually be given a 2.5 star rating since nothing was actually bad, it just didn't quite make par. Next time I'll check to make sure I'm going where I mean to go, but you don't get extra stars for teaching me a lesson.",

The first was advertised as a brunch (my complex put it on) but was sad to see it wasn't breakfast foods at all. The food was at least good though. When you expect breakfast and get lunch you cant help to be  a bit disappointed. This may have not been their fault though to be fair.  Last night I went to a second and while the food was alright they had no labels on anything -  one salad dressing choice( blue-cheese?).  They didnt have vegetarian options on their sandwich tray-which was over-packed and hard to decipher or pull apart. It would have been nice to have tongs for the sandwiches seeing that it was a public event and the idea of everyone touching my food is not particularly appealing. They also didnt even provide a spoon for the salad dressing- it had a plastic knife in it!  The chicken salad was good as was the pasta salad. I loved the HUGE delicious rice-crispy treats.   I may try this again at the location but I wouldn't recommend them for catering that's for sure!",

    "text": "Ever since Newk's opened in Blakeney, it was not allowed to be on \"the list\" because the only review my wife had heard about the place was from someone who's favorite restaurant is Chili's.  So, the only opinion she'd gotten about the food was tainted.  After a couple of catered events in her office done by Newk's, she relented and allowed us to try it.  While Newk's is in no way going to win \"Restaurant of the Year\" in South Charlotte, the food is very tasty.   The service is fast and the place is extremely kid friendly.  My only regret is not buying that piece of red velvet cake because now as I type this, I really want some red velvet cake.  My actual rating is 3.5 stars, but they don't allow that on Yelp... so I am rounding up and not down based on our good experience there.",

    "text": "I liked Newk's enough. The atmosphere is relax and chilled, at least when we went on a Tuesday after work. I went with Becky, Boy 2 and Girls 1 & 2. Each of the girls received a free-kid-meal coupon last week during Speedstreet and since we only had half of the litter of childrens, we thought it would be nice to go for a, not-so-usual-for-us, small dinner. The place is big and spacious and you can see how they're cooking your food. It's very clean and the staff is very friendly and attentive. The place was fairly empty when we visited which made it that much more of a nice, quiet visit for us and the kids. The menu is simple enough and priced like any other deli.  Some of the items that stood out were the shrimp poboy (one of my favorite dishes) and the white bbq sammich. I ordered the poboy with lobster bisque and Becky the white bbq sammich. Girl 1 had a cheese pizza, Girl 2 a grilled cheese and Boy 2 also a shrimp poboy. Service was fast and our server was very nice. Except for the cheese pizza, which had too much pizza sauce and not enough cheese for my taste, everything was really good. Nothing blew my mind, but everything was solid. My biggest problems were the shrimp in my poboy which were NOT breaded but, apparently, boiled. Not that it tasted poorly or anything, just not how I like my shrimp poboys and that Girl 2's grilled cheese was very bland. The white bbq sammich was definitely unique and really good but I am not a big fan of anything other than Eastern Carolina bbq sauce, so not something I plan to order if we go back. The lobster bisque, although delicious, had nothing special or unique about it.  All in all, it was a good dining experience and the food was good enough to go back if we're in the area.",

The restaurants run the gambit from basic lunch meat on Wonder bread to up to rather interesting panini to cater to all types of tastes and wallets.  Not entirely sure where Newks would fit into the spectrum we decided to give it a try.  Our first trip was actually for their soft opening on a Wednesday night.  In the spirit of full disclosure, the food was free on this first trip.  Despite it being a soft opening the staff was knowledgeable and efficient and the food was good.  The second time we went I looked at the prices.  While not outrageous considering the quality and quantity, they seemed high for most of the menu items are sandwiches and salads.  The food was no doubt good but I know I've had as good for a dollar or two less.",

I really can't way that any of us really enjoyed anything we had.  Newk's Salad had some very undesirable dressing, the BBQ sandwich had some odd tasting white BBQ sauce, and the worst of it all was grilled cheese, which was just melted cheese on a baguette.  Unfortunately all these misses makes this a bad place for lunch, regardless of extensive menu choices and many patrons.  The only good things were the roasted tomato soup, with a hint of spice, and the Orangina.  2 stars for the poor lunch fare, come here if you must, but there are better sandwich/salad places in the city.",

My favorite two dishes here are the black and blue salad but when I'm trying to watch my caloric intake I'll go with the grilled shrimp salad.  It's a huge salad, that is guaranteed to fill you up and only to the tune of like 450 calories total!  Now THAT is impressive!  The only thing I don't like is the fact that when you order a drink, there is only one size and it's always the plastic takeaway cups.  I feel bad throwing those away but seriously I can't have 15 plastic Newk's cups at my place.  Seems kinda wasteful....",

So, Newks has some great sandwiches.  Indeed.  I've had the Newk's \"Q\", the Roast Beef, and the Pimiento Cheese (with homemade pimiento cheese and really hard to beat!).  But, I'm in a \"reducing\" mode at the moment (way too many calories consumed in San Francisco!!) so I've been leaning toward salads and soups.  They have a different selection of soups every day and I've had several of them!  My favorite is still the Fire Roasted Tomato!  But just check out the list; you're bound to find one that sings for you!!  I tried the Garden Vegetable Soup today, and was very pleased!  It tasted great and check out the nutrition chart - only 80 calories per 8 oz serving!  Win!!  So, with the Half Soup and Half Salad deal (I selected the Caesar Salad), I had a low cal, tasty and very filling meal!! They have several (Count 'em - 10!!!) menu salads,each with it's own personality and taste combination.  And if you just can't find what you want on the list, order your own salad combination!  My wife likes the pizza (and sometimes I'll have a slice too!).  Her favorite, and mine too, is the Spicy Chicken.  Now the pizza isn't going to help your calorie count if you sit there and eat the whole thing, so share it!!  I think this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!  And fortunately for me, there are locations near my house, and downtown where I work!  I'll see you there!!!",

    "text": "Ok everyone knows the bread at this place is the shiznit.  I know it, and its the reason why I keep coming back.  However...  Today I met up with my sister for lunch here and I should have taken the way the employee treated us when I ordered our food, as a sign to get the fuck outta there.  She was giving us a dirty look, but I ignored it because shit, we all have bad days and thats what I thought she had.  We find a seat, get our drinks, and...wait.  10 minutes...20 minutes...30 minutes.  All of you mother fuckers who've been here know, they dont take 30 minutes to get you your food...maybe 5 minutes at most.  So anyway, a sandwich maker walked out and asked us if we got our food yet and I was like, yeah.  Obviously since we still have the number on our table.  She immediately brings us two slices of cake on the house.  Ok, thats nice, but I want my fucking food and Im on my lunch break, hello!    We get our food and my sandwich wasnt what I ordered.  She said, ok I'll go make the right sandwich but you can keep this one.  I told her, I dont care at this point I just want to eat.  While we eat, we notice we didnt get our sides.  On top of that we didnt get utensils and they always give that to you when they bring the food.    So my sandwich was brought out finally by the manager on duty Im assuming since he wore a different shirt.  I asked him, is there a reason why it took 30 minutes to get our food?  He looked shocked and went, Im assuming, to find out.  He never came back to our table to tell me.    At this point Im like, I need to get back to work.  So I went to the register and asked the employee for a refund for the stupid sides we didnt get.  She was like, you didnt get your sides??  Whaat??  Im thinking, calm down bitch, just give me the fucking refund so I can get the fuck outta here.  She said the manager has to approve it.  Perfect =).  He gets there, asks me what the problem is.  Im looking at him like, are you fucking crazy?  I asked you earlier why it took 30 minutes to get our food and you went and hid!  So I told him I need a refund for the two sides we didnt get.    He gives me the refund and some rice crispy treats and said sorry.  His excuse was, we've had a bad day its just been crazy.  Really dude?  Is that really your pathetic excuse for an answer?  I dont give a fuck if youre busy, what kind of system do you have where you forget to bring food to a table, especially when we have been sitting there with a number, visible to all the employees who are bringing food to everyone else.     Ugh anyway, yeah, first time Ive ever experienced haters at this place, AND here in bootsy ass Charlotte.  It was obvious the workers didnt like us right when we walked in.  Yeah, we arent black or white like the majority of the people in this city, but daaamn, we arent animals!!  Backward ass city.    And whats sad is the doormat of a manager couldnt do anything about it.  He didnt have the balls to go find out why it took 30 minutes to bring our food and come tell me.  Respect asshole, show some.  Love the bread, disappointed in the staff.",

    "text": "I've never had a bad meal at Newk's!  Their soups are great, and it's kind of hard to find a good soup (that isn't Panera or greasy chicken noodle) in uptown.  Lobster bisque is money, and I had the Ultimate Lobster soup today (I hate lobster, obviously), and it was awesome.  Great caesar salad, fresh and crunchy, and they have a little toppings bar.  Can't go wrong with some roasted garlic on the side (also hot peppers, pickles, capers, parmesan cheese, and thin crispy breadsticks).  Aside from all this... you know what the best part is?  The giant plastic cups that they give you when you get a fountain drink.  We have about 40 of them in the cupboard at work, they are awesome cups for large quantities of water or tea, so you don't have to keep refilling every minute.  It's the little things, people.  The little things.",

I got the chicken salad sandwich (I am in constant search of good chicken salad and have yet to find it in Charlotte...sigh....)  I was excited because the menu said it had almonds and grapes in it.  Um - they must have been microscopic because I couldnt find them.  The sandwich was big only because they took huge slices of bread and put literally one cup of chicken salad on it.  The bread made up the entire sandwich and there was such a tiny amount of salad I had to open the sandwich, scrap the salad of one half and put it on the other and have it open-faced just to get a sandwich affect instead of 'i am eating bread for lunch'.  Blah.   My boyfriend's shrimp salad was good and IF i go back to this place I will probably try the salads instead of the sandwiches.   Lastly - how could you NOT recycle those giant cups!!!!  What is wrong with you people!?!?!  The drink size is obsene and the busboy said they just throw away all of the plastic cups - can you get with it!?!?!?!",

After all, it must be a favorite for a reason, right? The salad included mixed greens, grilled chicken breast, gorgonzola cheese, dried cranberries, artichoke hearts, pecans, and nowhere-to-be-found croutons. I was a bit disappointed to see them missing but it might be due to the fact that I grabbed the 'to-go prepared' containers rather than having them toss the salad fresh. If you're here and have time, make sure you request to have it tossed.  The salad was topped off with a sherry vinaigrette which was lackluster to say the least. I've definitely had better salads, but here the ingredients just didn't taste as fresh.",

    "text": "Whenever possible, after a so-so experience at a restaurant, I try to return at least once or twice before writing a review.  After applying this logic, I can say this with a great degree of certainty:  Newks + Lunch Hour in Uptown = Trainwreck  Breadsticks flying, angry mobs of \"to go\" patrons flocking around the kitchen, confused/harried staff running everywhere, people jockeying for position to get a table/beverage refill..... It felt like I was dining in downtown Beirut.  The restaurant layout is horrible.  They need to reduce the amount of tables in this place by about 30-40% in order for people to be able to dine comfortably.  But of course, that doesn't sit well with the corporate management, who are willing to pack the place like sardines, with dollar signs in their eyes.  The food is ok, but who in the heck keeps clicking the \"$\" is beyond me.  I guess if you are comparing this place to the Capital Grill, ok...I can see one \"$\".  But for a deli, this place easily warrants \"$$$\".  By far the most expensive deli in the area, when price to value ratio is taken into consideration.  Steer clear of the \"Grab-N-Go\" fridge section, unless brown, wilted lettuce is your thing.  Funny thing to note: they have the prices blanked out on their online menu.  Why do you think that is, I imagine?  So you don't know what you are going to be out of pocket, for a sandwich, until you are already inside and it's too late for you and your colleagues to try another spot?  Redeeming quality is in the portion size.  But then again, when you are paying that type of money for SOUP, I expect it to be served in a gallon milk jug.  Verdict:  Plenty of better sandwich and salad options in Uptown, especially if you are willing to spend this type of money for this type of food.",

Their salads look pretty amazing, but I've yet to partake myself.  Newk's gets packed at lunch, but despite the seeming chaos, the people who work there seem to be busting their rears and getting the food out as fast as they can. And, even though it seems slammed, you can usually find a place to sit pretty quickly.    They have 4 soup options that change everyday, but, be warned--most of their soups are fatty fatty cream-based (including the tomato!??), so you always have to ask which soup is broth-based. My only complaint of this place would be to lay off the cream-based soups!",

    "text": "While their food is ok, the service is AWFUL.  I just returned from what should have been a quick lunch.  Arriving before the lunch rush, my boyfriend and I ordered and found a table.  I then proceeded to wait over 15 minutes for a SALAD and they completely forgot about my boyfriend's salad.  After over 20 minutes, he went to the register for the To-Go items and they claimed they \"just never saw\" his order.  Therefore, he received his salad about 25 minutes after ordering.  Having a 12:30pm meeting looming, this unacceptable delay meant I had to eat quickly and leave him to eat his food alone as I had to get back to the office. When my salad was brought to me, the server apologized and said that he forgot to bring a fork.  He sort of mumbled that he'd bring one but seeing as how lunch breaks aren't endless, I went up to the cashier and asked for a plastic fork.  He never came back with a fork so I guess I'm glad I didn't wait. There is fairly limited seating here, especially for the lunch rush.  Sitting near the front today, I noticed a young man sitting directly behind the cashiers at a dining table.  He wasn't eating nor waiting for food.  He just sat there and had conversations with the cashier that was in front of him.  I observed several people stand right near him, scanning the restaurant for a place to sit, and he was completely oblivious to the fact that he should MOVE!  Also, if the cashier had any sense of providing good customer service, she would ask him to move.  Pretty sure tables in a restaurant are for paying customers.   The cashiers should also not be engaged in conversation during the busiest time of the restaurant's day. Overall, I am far from impressed with this place.  Maybe it's ok to grab something to-go or stop in WELL after the lunch crowd.  The manager of this restaurant needs to seriously revamp the way service is provided, especially during the lunch rush.  Bottom line: If your restaurant is trying to cater to the lunch crowd, the employees need to understand and respect the fact that patrons, for the most part, have a limited time for lunch.",

Wandered in for lunch with a friend WITH a baby in a stroller. Welcome to TOTAL CHAOS. Our mistake.  However, the manager immediately saw our deer in the headlights look, and cleared a table for us and stashed the stroller out of the way.  That was the first win for customer service.  Following that, all the staff were extremely friendly and seemed genuine about it too.  Three words about the food.  Chicken salad sandwich.   I sincerely love it.  It's mayo-based, made fresh every day and served on a nicely soft-yet-slightly crunchy baguetteish bread.  They also dress the sammy with rustic mustard which I personally love.  The Greek salad is also tasty. Well dressed and plenty to share or have as an entire meal.   SIDEBAR: I loathe salads served on plates ( seriously, who wants to push their salad around and potentially off the plate in hopes of stabbing/getting the correct  combo of ingredients  on your fork?)  But Newk's serves their salads in asymmetrical bowls for easy enjoying.  While I definitely avoid this place during lunch hours - even the to go wait seems long - I certainly enjoy my off-peak hour chicken salad indulgences here more often than I care to share.",

    "text": "I have been to a few Newk's cafe's locations so I know what to expect going here for lunch.  Because this location is near my office, I have patronized this Uptown site numerous times.  To me, Newk's Uptown feels like a smaller space than the other sites I have been to.  Nothing like the Newk's I visited in Springfield, MS (probably the best laid out one that I have ever been to) but similar to the one in Greensboro, NC.  Atmosphere - Located in a former restaurant/ night club (same three or so steps to go up from the main entrance) the feel here is busy, noisy, more tables than booths, informal, messy (always feels like you just arrived after a lunch rush), fast casual order and delivery process.  Food - Lots of choices that include sandwiches (toasted), salads, soups and pizza.  I usually get the chicken speciality sandwich, with ice tea and fruit.  This sandwich comes with grilled chicken applewood smoked bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, olive oil, mayo and Honey Mustard on a decent in texture baguette.  I get this when I want to eat healthy by dropping the swiss cheese, mayo and honey mustard.    When I want to eat something that has a lot of flavor, I get the Italian.  It has capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami, provolone cheese, mayo, spicy creole mustard, lettuce, tomato, yellow onions, hot cherry peppers and Italian sauce.  While I do drop the mayo...just don't like it...this sandwich is still a  calorie and flavor indulgence.    Service - It is good for a place that takes your order, gives you a number, a cup, a tray, and then makes you wait for the food to arrive.  On my several visits here everyone has been friendly (even when there is a mistake) and the place is always jammed.  Overall - An okay, option for lunch in Uptown.  With drink you are over $10, which some have deemed pricy.  But when you think about about it, a Chick-fil-a combo is only a buck or two below that price and they don't bring it to your table.    Tips:   * Reinforce any special order requests as the staff has gotten it wrong in the past. * During lunch, grab a table ASAP after ordering as they can vanish quickly!",

    "text": "The two stars are for the food only. It was just OK, nothing special for sure. Their menu has many options to choose from this was our first and last visit. The reason for it being our first and last visit has to do 100% with the POOR service. We were greeted upon walking in by a very kind and friendly person who took our order sadly things went down hill quickly from there. We ordered fountain drinks which should have been a non issue! First there was little to no ice, I told Christina there was no ice, she said OK but never bothered to get any ice for us. My guess the reason was because it was 7:05 and they were closing at 8 so why bother. Next issue is there's no COKE products, that's a problem when your fountain machine is a coke dispenser.  So I inform Christina there's a problem with the drink machine, she tells me they know they've had issues with it for a while, seriously?? SO You folks just sold us fountain drinks knowing there was an issue?? Thanks!!!! Oh but wait Christina very loudly tells us we can have a refund, OK great so no drink with our dinner?? No thanks!!! The lemonade did work but that's not what we ordered!! Christina delivered our food with her huge poor attitude just as she had when we requested ice, she never once came by our table to ask if everything was ok. She did ask the table beside us as well as behind us, just not us! Maybe she thought we'd ask for ice again??? As if the poor service we received wasn't bad enough just as we were finishing our meal we notice someone trying to get ice but like us unable to do so, interestingly enough Christina went to back to get ice to fill the ice machine, nice she could do it approximately 15 minutes before closing but couldn't be bothered to do so 55 minutes before closing. I must say that after 33 years of marriage I have never witnessed my husband walk out of a resturant and not leave a tip, this was a first!!!! I spoke with a female who I suppose was the manager about the drink issue as well and her only solution was a refund as well, nice a refund vs informing the customer when they order a fountain drink?? Sadly this was the case last night.",

I ordered the grilled steak sandwich.  This was described as  marinated and grilled steak with provolone, carmelized onions and horseradish sauce.  Let's take these one by one...  Marinated - In what?  Tasted nothing aside from plain old roast beef Grilled -  If it was grilled, there was no way to tell.  No grill marks, no charred parts Steak - Cut too thick, bland, gristly, tough, dry and in woefully short supply relative to the size of the roll Provolone - It was there and melted so, no issues Carmelized Onions - Try steamed or, at best, barely sauteed. Horseradish Sauce - Hardly any there so, couldn't tell if it was just tasteless or missing  Typically average chain fare at too high of a price tag...",

    "text": "I LOVE a good sandwich.  I'm usually not a big raver of lunch places...because honestly...eh, it's lunch.    Yet Newk's impresses me every single time I go.  It's one of those places that's great for office lunches and Saturday morning hangovers..  Everything I've had from there is absolutely delicious.  Now that I've gotten my rave out I'll go into the details.  I've had a variety of the soups Newk's offers and will say that both the crab soup and chicken chili are to die for.  The crab is perfectly seasoned and just a little spicey.  It's very rich so I recommend ordering a salad for the perfect lunch combo.  The chicken chili is hearty and full of flavor.  I pair that with the steak sandwich and it is by far one of my favorite lunches you can order in the city.    Now, to get to the sandwiches.  Anyone who is anyone knows the key to a great sandwich is in the bread.  Newk's knocks it out of the park each and every time.  There is something about a warm, soft roll that makes any sandwich absolutely delicious.  You could put a flip flop between that roll and I would probably eat it.   The steak sandwich is the best I've had in Charlotte.  Which is saying a lot, as I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur.  Again, the bread is just perfect.  The steak they use on the sandwich is cooked very well, not too stringy or tough without being rare.  The onions are sweet and that horseradish mayo I would most likely bathe in.    If you need to impress someone over a casual lunch or simply want to put something in your mouth that is absurdly delicious, Newk's is your best bet.",

Well positioned on Tryon, Newk's offers a smattering of fresh salads, sandwiches and the like. Plus, they're open pretty late!  I had the half & half combo - roasted turkey sandwich and chicken & dumpling soup. The freshness was there, the french bread holding my sandwich had a nice toasty crunch and the soup was hearty. So, yeah, it was good, not incredible, amazing, can't get enough. Plus, it was a wee bit on the pricey side - close to $10 for my meal & beverage.   Nevertheless, for friendly staff and a quick & filling meal amongst many a steak house and pricey restaurant, Newk's is a solid choice Uptown!",

It's an ideal stop for fast service. You can order and dine in or they have a small section to grab something to go (like you see at airports). Expect casual, fast dining here and I can see it being super popular during lunchtime. When I went, it was around 6pm and the place was vacant.   The employees were friendly and patient while I was figuring out what I wanted. I got one of their salads. It was okay. The salad bowl was very modern and was tipped at an angle...be careful or when you stab at your food it may become off balanced and topple over (close call for me).   While I don't see Newk's as one of my deliberate, go to stops, I do see it as a convenient one when in Uptown.",

I've only tried the shrimp remoulade, and it's fantastic!  It's filled with large shrimp, hard boiled eggs, and grape tomatoes, and is served with a mustard-based sauce.

The BBQ sauce was definitely interesting and challenges what you think and know about traditional sauce. The mac and cheese flavor was okay as well.

We've ordered (a salad and a pizza) and sat for about 15 minutes when the \"manager\" came to our table and let us know they don't have sausage for our pizza. That tells me they haven't even started our order yet. Great. (Hint of sarcasm)  Now this \"manager\" has been in the food prep area making the salads and delivering the food (and bad news) to the customers. She has gone to the back behind closed doors, she has helped the cashier with a problem with the register by plunking in some numbers or secret codes into the touchscreen computer. Seems like a great manager, right? This person has been wearing the same latex gloves the entire time. Yes, the same pair. Gross.   The cashier was kind enough to turn her head when she coughed while serving us our food. The same cashier that was struggling with the register that the latex glove wearing manager fixed. One can only assume that the very sweet and friendly cashier spread her cough cooties all over that touchscreen.   So to recap, the same pair of latex gloves went from the fresh veggies salad area, out to the restaurant seating area, to the back room, to the register, to our table and then back to dive into the fresh veggies again. Those are some serious traveling gloves!",

Friday night, around 8pm, completely empty, and they were working on preparing a catering order. We were recognized immediately and taken care of - I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich (on the 11-grain bread) with Pasta Salad and The Lady ordered a salad. The sandwich, although relatively basic, was good, exactly what I wanted.  The only negative thing I have to say, is that the pasta salad had ZERO flavor, and was almost frozen. It's what dropped this down from a 4 to a 3 star, because I've tried the same at their Rock Hill location and it was much better. Blech.   Anyways, we probably won't come here that often, but it is a quick and easy option uptown!",

If you don't use all the dressing (you shouldn't need to as they give you a lot), it's actually really healthy.  For this trip, we walked in, but ordered to-go. It was around 7:30 on a weeknight and the place was dead, so we got taken care of right away. It took less than 10 minutes to get our food and it was prepared nicely.",

I'm in and out in less than 3 minutes.  I really can't recommend standing in line and eating in the restaurant during lunch - it's just a madhouse.  The food - get the soups.  My favorites are the tomato basil bisque, the corn and crab chowder and the lobster bisque.  When you get a soup, you have the option of ordering grilled bread - do it, so worth it!  I also really like their salads - they are always crisp and fresh and generous with the toppings.  There's an \"extras\" bar by the cash register - grab a couple of packaged breadsticks to go.  For sandwiches, I like the seared ahi tuna and the grilled steak sandwiches.  I usually will order a half sandwich and a half salad (on the days I don't get the soup).",

I got a chicken salad sandwich and the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese will def get me to come back here as it was so good!

I had not been here for nearly a year, but gVe it a shot today because it was drizzling outside and I didn't want to walk far. This was around 3:00. However, after ordering only soup, it took 6 minutes to get my soup. There was no line in front of me. The manager was  talking to a staff member and given the time, I could have made it myself 3x in the time it took. When there is a line, 6 minutes is okay. When you're just waiting on someone to take the initiative to make your order, it's unacceptable.   On top of that, the food here isn't great. My crab and corn chowder was salty. There are no discernible pieces of crab in the soup. I think it's just crab flavored. In the past, when I got sandwiches, the sub bread is far too thick and flavorless. For the price you pay here, you can go to Dean and Deluca or Panera Bread for a meal of much higher quality than here. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. The staff has changed over the last year for the worse and service has suffered.",

    "text": "This review is a bit overdue but I keep thinking back to my experience here and it was too good not to compliment the establishment!  I'm from California and visited Charlotte this past month. I came in to dine on April 1st at around 130 pm for lunch and was just blown away by the exceptional customer service. Adrian was outside greeting and saw me glancing over the menu thru the windows. He was so friendly and sincere in greeting everybody, even if they were just cruisin' down the road. I kept walking and eventually turned around cause I really wanted that turkey/avo sandwich I saw advertised. The cashiers were so friendly. Bussers, servers, cashiers, and managers all very respectful and hard working. I was checked up on and made sure i was taken care of by everyone. Complete culture shock coming from california. Everyone is so nice and down to earth. This was my first restaurant experience in the state and it was a WONDERFUL way to begin my trip. Thanks Newks!  Oh and PS- Food. Was . AMAZING.",

    "text": "When I left work for lunch I picked a direction and started walking until I saw a place I'd like to try.  Today the direction was North and the Place was Newk's.  The place was very busy even on a cold day.  The line to order was short and moved quickly.  I ordered a shrimp Po'boy which comes with 1 side.  I chose the coleslaw.  I thought I was going to have a hard time finding a place to sit, but there were a couple of bar type seating areas for the onesies & towsies.  It took a while to get my food, but not out of line for as busy as it was.  The sandwich always looks bigger & better in the photo on the menu board, but it was pretty good.  The bread was fresh with a hard crust and chewy center.  The shrimp were cooked just right.  The side of coleslaw was bland though with no flavor.  The sandwich came with some cocktail sauce and an aioli mayo or aioli tarter sauce (not quite sure which, but it was very tasty).  I mixed some of the  aioli into the slaw and BAM!, that kicked up a notch.   The menu is pretty extensive with salads, sandwiches (toasted and deli), and soups.  You can also get a half & half special (get you mind out of the gutter please) which is half of a sandwich/salad/soup combo mix and match as you please.   The shrimp Po'boy was kind of pricey, $10, but it was very tasty.  Next time I'll probably get the soup/sandwich combo as some of the soups looked pretty tasty.  If I could give half stars Newk's would get 3 1/2, but I can't go 4 up to because of the bland coleslaw.",

    "text": "I checked this place out yesterday for the first time.   It was crowded and we combined tables but the busboy alerted me to a larger table that he was cleaning up, which was nice since we had three with my wife's friend.  The bread they use is very good and the sandwich (I got the Italian) was a good size, probably too big for lunch.  Next time we go we'll probably split a sandwich and just get an extra side.  I tried the cole slaw, which was just OK.  I look forward to going back and trying other things on the menu.  I knew that being right in the middle of Uptown it wouldn't be cheap but $20 for two sandwiches and sides is a little expensive imo.",
