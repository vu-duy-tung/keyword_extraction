Wishing and hoping they'll soon offer matcha that is unsweetened though :/  Love this spot. Will be back.",

The milk was steamed perfectly, they didn't overload the latte with syrup and they finished it with a beautiful design at the end. If you're looking to stay, sitting is somewhat limited but if you go during non-peak hours you should be fine. Facility is super clean, even the bathrooms! Baristas are friendly and efficient. This place even offers educational classes to the community and those looking to grow careers in the coffee world. It's in the heart of a very communal neighborhood in Charlotte called Commonwealth.",

My best is Swiss coffee. The preparation of the coffee? Now we get into \"coffee snobbery\". Drip, pour, press....blah blah blah. I know good coffee. So that isn't the point. When I go to a coffeehouse I intend to sit for a while and have ... many... cups of coffee, and good conversation. The fact that you can't get a good drip coffee after 1pm, instead of having to go through all the machinery and mechanics of \"the trendy pour\" makes my desire to sit, have some intelligent discourse, over many cups of coffee...feel like a wet bed. The atmosphere here is cold, no \"professional\" art on the walls, and too many windows (where there should be art - and enclosed to make a more cozy atmosphere. What happened to the...idea...of a coffee house? Apparently the owners need to research the history of coffee houses. And they close at 7pm!? Good grief, coffee drinkers love hanging out in coffee houses until midnight! This place has no vision and no concept for a good coffee house. And the tipping crap needs to stop (for an underserving gesture) ....everywhere. Unless you want to come to my table, take my order, and bring it to me.",

If you're used to drinking burnt, too hot coffee from that Chain Which will Remain Nameless, then Undercurrent's approach may take some getting used to. They serve coffee at a ready to drink temperature that preserves the nuanced flavors of the high quality beans that they use, and they don't scorch their milk when making lattes. They have rigorously trained their employees to meet a standard of quality and consistency that is really hard to find. I was able to take a sip of the pour over that I ordered without immediately burning my mouth, and the flavors were layered and divine. Are you used to having things your way? A creature of habit? Perhaps just *try* something different and be open to the new experience. Depending on what you order, you should expect to wait longer than you would at that Chain Which will Remain Nameless, but again, it's worth it! This is not a \"turn and burn\" business model. Praise be! Relax, enjoy the beautiful interior, and let the masters do their work.",

This place got a lot of hype, and I have to admit that it did live up to the expectations.    After we got through the line, I ordered a matcha latte with almond milk (they also have oat milk!), the avocado toast with a poached egg, and a triangle shaped oat-like dessert pastry (I don't remember the name of it, but it was sooo delicious!). The matcha latte was as expected, and the avo toast was really good!  It is served on a nice thick slice of bread, with fresh avocado, and spices.  The egg was absolutely cooked to perfection!  I personally hate when I order a poached egg with a yolk nearly all the way cooked, and this was definitely not that. Would recommend, but the only downside is that it is a bit pricey, but find me a specialty coffee shop that isn't...",

Great little addition to what fills a definite void in the Plaza. Great space, great light, comfy seating, good service.  They don't offer unsweetened matcha which was disappointing. Ended up with an iced coffee and almond milk. J had an iced vanilla latte.  The glassware was nice for dining in, but kind of small.  Price was in line of other shops in town. Not Just, Hex, Trade & Lore, etc. about $12 all-in for two drinks.",

    "text": "A warm welcome to coffee lovers alike but I have to say there were a few lack luster very important qualities that make a coffee house, well, a coffee house (literally). This shop is out of a house, its quaint, its bright, its modern with nooks in several places inside for one to work, read or socialize. It also has a nice front sitting area to enjoy alfresco. Everyone I encountered was \"friendly enough\". I ordered the pour over which I love in general because you truly get to enjoy and savor your coffee. I found the brew to be very weak and when I used the alternative oak milk provided aside from cream which I can't do, I found that it was even more distant to the taste of coffee. My friend ordered the cold brew and asked for a shot of espresso. I took a sip just to see, and I probably would go back and try an espresso style drink next time, with an extra shot. I wish they had also provided almond milk aside from cream and oat milk, but perhaps it wasn't set up that day (?). I was pressed to try the avocado toast since its extremely highlighted when I had read up on them. Initially I was impressed because it looked beautiful, the micro amaranth is so pretty and such a great color contrast to the avocado. I asked for the egg to be on top which was cooked perfectly. The toast itself was very tasty, as were the spiced seeds, however, there was this faint taste of I am thinking cumin??? My initial bite, I was intrigued but after my third I didn't have a desire to finish it, it just had this strange taste. I left hungry but not hungry enough to try something else. I want to give it another shot because I really enjoy a nice coffee shop, update to follow.",

Excited to try out undercurrent but slightly disappointed when the largest sized coffee they have was no bigger than an actual sized small coffee. Paying $5 for something so small isn't quite what I was expecting. Other than the size, the coffee and atmosphere is nice. Not sure we will be back but it was worth a try.",

I asked for milk alternatives. They only offer oat milk. I wanted a scrambled egg, they couldn't offer that. And the worst part is my cappuccino was LUKE WARM!  The espresso has a good flavor.  It is smaller than I expected on the inside. No patio either.  Apple Pay wasn't working which is highly expected for a first day.  So I do expect great things from this coffee shop such as a variety of milk alternatives and hot espresso.  Good luck guys!",

I kept seeing this place pop up on my social media and the outside is so cute and inviting that o decided to check it out!   Right of way the place has a modern but cozy feel. Very tastefully decorated! The have plush chairs and two seater couches for people. There is also more room in the back. The place is all windows (at least up front) which allows for natural light!   The lady at the counter was really sweet. I told her it was my first time and she explained the menu to me. What I really enjoyed was that there weren't a million different coffee options. That always overwhelms me and stresses me out at other places. It was a simple and clean menu. There were some interesting tea options, but I decided to go for the iced latte.  Side note: have you ever looked at a coffee picture and say \"I want that\" and whenever you order you can never seem to get it..well that DIDN'T happen here! I got what I saw in a picture, it looked the same, and it was so delicious!!! Although I thought I ordered the brown sugar latte and they gave me a vanilla one. It doesn't matter though because it was so good.   The coffee is on the expensive side (just my opinion). My iced latte was a little over $5. Again very delicious, but definitely not an everyday stop. All in all this coffee shop should be checked out!",

I tried the grit bowl too- so tasty! It's not huge but it's enough to be full without being overstuffed. The grits are seriously the BEST IVE EVER HAD. Not greasy, plenty of flavor. Definitely pay to add an egg on top. The mushrooms and goat cheese topping that come standard are delicious   They have a lovely indoor space- good for doing work or relaxing and chatting. They also have a few tables outside. Make sure you check inside for your order- they won't track you down to give your food or coffee",

That's what happened with me and Undercurrent Coffee. I've apparently passed this place multiple times and never seen it, and I'm so sad about that.   This coffee shop is great and quiet and even better it's an awesome workspace. After my coffee meeting, I spent some time working in the open space they have available. They offer free wifi and comfy lounge chairs while you're working. On warmer days I would definitely recommend working outside under the shade tree. It's very peaceful and in the day it's not busy.   I would certainly recommend this place for working, meeting friends, or simple coffee + chill.",

Maybe it's because of that stupid horrible awful terrible no good very bad parking situation in the rest of the neighborhood. Anyways.   There are tons of seating options all throughout Undercurrent and despite a pretty packed house, we were able to find several options, including snagging a seat with strangers at one of the larger tables. I ordered a latte (my benchmark coffee shop drink) and was offered the option of a single origin espresso. Sure, why not? I also got breakfast there with their grits option. Sounded good enough.  The latte came out in a generous mug with wonderful steamed milk art (per usual these days, but there are still some that stand out). The flavor was EXCELLENT, it really made the coffee sing. Complex and dark. The grits arrived shortly after and they were served in a ceramic bowl. Holy cow. Man, these were awesome savory grits with cremini mushrooms. I've seen enough, the food here is great as well as the coffee.   Wifi is plentiful and there are tons of work stations and outlets, which was perfect as The Lady and I showed up to do some photo editing. I had a great experience at Undercurrent and won't hesitate to come back.   One word of advice/caution: If you're easily affected by cold temperatures, you may want to bring a jacket. The Lady has been there more than I have at this point and she says that the AC has consistently ran on MEGA HIGH mode at all times. So... you've been warned. Winter is coming. For those warm bloods like me, you'll be fine ;)",

If you read my reviews, you know that customer service is EVERYTHING to me.   3. Location. It's hard to go wrong with a coffee house in Plaza-Midwood. However, Undercurrent is pleasantly positioned in a space that welcomes people-watching or just a nice vibe for creativity.   I was not overwhelmed by my chai latte--I've had better. But, I appreciate the fact that it was a real chai instead of a concentrated mix.   Can't wait to visit again!",

I've not tried it yet, but the Golden Milk and Matcha latte seem to be popular among patrons each time I've gone. They are on my list to try!  The food menu is expertly crafted and prepared and offers something for everyone.  My favorites so far are the sour cream coffee cake, scones, avocado toast with the poached egg.

The crimini mushrooms are a must add, and add the egg! They also source food locally which is important to me. If I lived closer I'd come here to work often. The baristas are friendly and the larger bathroom has furniture that can be used as a chasing table too, which makes bringing a baby easier. Great spot and delicious coffee!",

    "text": "Super cool new coffee shop in Plaza Midwood! I walked in a little before 9am on a Saturday and the place was already packed. Barely any wait for coffee, so the staff moves pretty quick.  I ended up with the Pure Intentions Cold Brew on tap. So good! They have half and half and almond milk on the side, and whole milk behind the bar.  I guess Almond Milk is all the rage now, but I'm not into it.  The first time I went, I got a good cold brew.  The second time, I got a latte.  I do love that they have some simple syrup on the side bar rather than a bunch of different sugar options.  I also ordered the Avocado Toast with an egg on top, and it literally looked like a work of art. Sliced avocado, too, not guacamole!  The ambiance is very welcoming.  There are a number of modern chairs/couches and some community tables where you can work or meet someone for coffee.  The place is much bigger than it looks, so don't be scared to go to the back!  Overall, I'm really happy with the new addition to the Plaza Midwood area. The place is inviting and you will not hesitate to just sit for a few minutes and enjoy your coffee with some latte art on the top.  If your'e looking to just run in, grab a quick cup and bolt out without making conversation with the staff, I would say this place isn't for you.",

There is also educational opportunities to see the highly scientific / intricate process in making a perfect cup of coffee that's worthwhile in checking out.  I highly recommend checking this place out before 3pm for some brunch. The seasonal drinks are my favorite thus far.",

    "text": "What a cool place with potential but... falling just short of a 5 star only for the poor set-up of the place as soon as you walk in you walk straight into the line waiting for orders and tables stacked right in the front area add to the congestion and claustrophobic feel of the restaurant, once you order and get to the back it opens up quite a bit. We made our order and apparently they yell your name but in our case with people filling the front and and people talking in the back we never heard them call us, so our food just sat there and got away from just cooked temp. We both ordered the avocado Toast and it was very good and in the world of restaurants not being able to cook eggs properly the poached eggs were perfect! and the toast was just plain awesome. Coffee was okay and the coffee prep area is another place that is poorly designed, to make your coffee with all of the other traffic near the front and people waiting for their food to be called (So apparently they don't miss out and end up with food cold also wait in the front area, adding to the already congested front area.) it is a constant, excuse me, pardon me, sorry, excuse me, pardon me. They do have free WiFi. We will try it again and a different coffee instead of their brewed see if it is a better quality for us. The crowd at the front was a pain but not enough to take away from the cool vibe of this place, I think maybe just some moving around of things could make this much more pleasant and put Menus outside in a box so people can make up their mind before the counter and move coffee prep further back in the room. This may take care of the congestion and if your people notice food still sitting there mins later have them call it out again. I know you are looking at this wondering why still 4 stars, it is because cool Vibe, Good food, Service was adequate,  we may have caught it during their busy time, the noise level was too loud for us to hear them call our names for our food. Benefit of the doubt. We will return a couple more times.",

Being my first time, I must have come around rush hour lol because it was pretty packed. I ended up sitting at the bar for maybe an hour until after noon which it started to slow down. Not the best place to take a business call but outside on the patio was much better. Being a French press coffee drinker the the medium roast was a bit weak and they were out of dark roast by noon which was weird. For the life of me, I couldn't connect to their wireless and another guy sitting next to me said the same. I verified the password twice so maybe it was an operator problem lol.  Overall, it was a good experience and I'll definitely be back. Such a nice open and well lite space. I'll probably come before or after noon to avoid the rush but definitely check out UC, very cool spot.",

The issue is the seating and people camping out there for HOURS. Its very hard to find a spot and the drinks take a while so even just waiting for your drink is awkward. We often sit outside which is a good option. They may need even more seating there too.",

Tucked away in Plaza Midwood, in the poppin spot at the end of commonwealth near Legion brewery & Common market. They have one only parking lot, in the back. It has  5 spots plus 1 handicap and 1 other reg spot. Total of 7 spots! So might have to find some street parking, but the walk ain't bad and it's free.   Once you walk up, you notice the outside seating area which is nice. Then you walk in to find more cozy nooks. Well mostly chairs and couches. But also some bar seating, table seating, and benches. It seems to be a good place to study or meet up with friends for coffee. Anything goes! Good vibes inside.   Menu wise. I had my eye on a few things. They have golden milk (a Turmeric based latte), matcha, and chai! My trio favs. As well as all the normal coffee and latte options. I tried a latte. Plain jane one (not the name) I just didn't do anything fancy to it. You can opt in oat milk, if that is your thing they have it! My latte was $4.35, oat milk was $0.75 but I didn't do that. It was good, not amazing...prices do seem a tad high. Their food looks yummy, I will def come back to try some soon and try one of my trio favs.",

    "text": "Undercurrent Coffee NAILS everything! From all the obvious things you'd want to the smallest details you didn't even know would add to your coffee shop experience, I was truly impressed. Visiting from Southern California, we're not lacking in coffee shops and as a student I've visited a ton over the last few years, but Undercurrent has distanced itself as my best coffee shop experience to date!  COFFEE / FOOD Delicious! Not only is their drip fresh and their lattes beautifully crafted, they offer a relatively large menu of options including non-caffeinated drinks and speciality drinks. Their coffee is a smooth, balanced experience and you really can't go wrong with their offerings. You can really appreciate their creativity in some of their drink. As for the food, while it might not blow you away, they have a number of brunch options including a grits bowl that isn't too bad.  SERVICE Every worker I've come across so far has been pleasant and helpful. I've had no issues and even when there was a power outage for a time, the workers were very accommodating to allow customers to still hangout inside while other nearby business closed down completely.  AMBIENCE / AMENITIES This is probably where Undercurrent shines the most! Inside, you'll find a spacious, clean, and modern shop accentuated by large windows and tungsten lighting that invite a remarkably warm atmosphere. I love the minimalistic feel of the whole place.  As for amenities, they offer a number of seating options from couches towards the front, a community work table in the middle, and small tables towards the back. Bar seating throughout. At each spot, you'll find conveniently placed outlets. Seating is comfortable and the desks are wooden in texture (I hate glossy/glass tables). Parking can be limited but there are no time limits on the main street!  Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Undercurrent Coffee! Really wish we had this place in SoCal--it would be my absolute go-to for meetups, studying, or just to relax. Go check them out!",

I say this not really believing that Charlotte has great coffee--this is great coffee. It's rich, dark, fresh, and high-quality.   The food is decent. Portions are meh. I've had baked goods, chia pudding, and avo toast (and a bite of the turmeric yogurt). The vegan carrot cake muffin is far too ginger-y and is just a little too weird. The chia pudding was fine but I can make that myself. The avo toast was super loaded and yummy. My mom loved the golden yogurt.  My only qualm with this place is the pricepoint--it's up there. For an occasional treat, it's worth it, but it'd be more successful if everything was $1-2 less.",

    "text": "Chic. Mixed use space. Warm. Quaint.  Undercurrent has been booming since the day it opened. It have a European vibe, feeling slightly Mediterranean or Grecian. The coffee menu is good - offering oat milk and all the other non-dairy options. They have tasty treat selections and even a small menu of kitchen made items. Sometimes I pop in for a Togo cup and when I have ample time I squeeze into a shared table to do a little work or chat with a friend for an hour.  The space is small, but welcoming. It feels like you want to be there. On this day i had golden oat milk latte and the avacado toast.   Oh, the owner is Super nice a steward of the community who knows his coffee well!",

    "text": "One of my favorite coffee shops because of the inventive drinks and great breakfasts and snacks! This cute place is tucked in Elizabeth. There's plenty of seats inside to get comfy and a lot of windows for an airy, open feel.   I love their seasonal specialty drinks. They play with both cold and hot coffee/espresso drinks and just know the right flavors to pair with their beans and brew method. My favorite winter drink is the campfire cupacino -- it's a smoked black tea with marshmallow that literally tastes like a campfire smells.   Their breakfast and snack foods are delicious! The muffins are vegan and they'll warm them up for you. The avocado toast is over the top in the best way possible -- and you can add a poached egg, which I recommend. The oats are delicious as well. You really can't go wrong!   Seating outside and parking outback is pretty limited. You can find street parking, however.",

    "text": "It's in the fine tuning and the details.  This little shop is quite refined and well curated all the way around.  Every detail was precisely planned in a way that fuses the perfect low-key Midwood coffeehouse environment.  From the colors to the cups and the decor to the floor; it all gives a sense of calm and class.  What makes it even better is that just as much thought and care is put into every cup of coffee brewed as well.  Located in the middle of the infamous Commonwealth curve, across from The Common Market, you must be prepared for the reverse angled parking along the street, but there's also a very small lot around the backside of the building.  However, it's primarily a walking destination for the Midwood minglers, so it's never much an issue.  Once inside, you're greeted by the tasteful designs that give that welcoming allure.    Step to the counter to place your order.  A small selection of baked goods rest in the case to the left and a menu board is posted to the right.  The menu boasts simplicity, as the focus is on quality vs. quantity of offerings.  It's not the place for your triple pump, 1/2 soy, white chocolate, pumpkin, machimattato basic chick BS.  If that's what you're after, there's a Starbucks in the Harris Teeter on the corner, so please step aside.   A coffee connoisseur's dream.  Undercurrent awaits you...  Check out the studio in the back by the restrooms to learn more about cuppings and classes offered.",
