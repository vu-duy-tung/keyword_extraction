You walk up to the counter, place your order, and wait. You might wait a while for your food, in fact (because they have a small grill/kitchen/prep area and a line out the door of hungry customers). Finding a table is a bit of a chore, too. Just imagine you're in the middle of NYC awaiting the best Gyros (or other mediterranean treat), and you will feel better about standing around waiting on a table in the middle of a strip mall in Ballantyne. : )  I've tried practically everything on the menu, so I can't comment on everything. But.. the standouts to me are: Potato harra (on the side dish menu), Gyros (of course, get the platter, you won't be disappointed when you have leftovers to take home), the hummus and pita, the shawarma.. Geez, it's all so stinkin' good, you just have to go and experience it yourself to understand where I'm coming from, OK? And then write me and tell me you thought of it.   Be sure to take some baklava or other sweet treats to go, and buy extra because you'll want to share it with a good friend (if it lasts that long).  Delish!!!",

I decided on the falafel platter which included a choice of hummus or babba ghanouj and a choice of a salad with olives and feta, fatoush or tabbouleh. The hummus was perfect. It comes with 3 pita diamonds and when that runs out, the falafel is pretty tasty dipped in it. The tahini sauce on top of the falafal tasted really great and helped keep them moist. Overall, it was the best falafal I've found in Charlotte. They wear their Yelp best of sticker, well!!",

    "text": "The next stop on my Charlotte tour of Mediterranean food spots is...Zeitouni Grill!  I work at Toringdon. You know, that office/business complex, right off of 485 on the Johnston Road exit, where the Red Robin and Earth Fare are both located? You know, there? Got it? See it? That building directly across the street from Red Robin? That's where I work. See me waving? Hi!  So my point to Toringdon is this: other than Red Robin (which, frankly, is pretty meh when it comes to burgers, and the atmosphere sucks) or Earth Fare (which, frankly, their take-out/dine-in options leave plenty to be desired, especially from such a place that supposedly prides itself on health food alternatives that cater to the surplus number of crunchy granolas living in exile from Asheville, and the die-hard fitness freaks that show up all sweaty and red-faced and all jacked-up on adrenaline and self-importance after having done some hardcore yoga at the Urban Active across the street...but anyway...), a quick or at least convenient meal that doesn't require you to get in your car and navigate the fustercluck that is Johnston Road during lunch time, AND you're pretty tired of brown bagging it every day, then what the hell are you going to do for lunch, huh?  Thankfully, Zeitouni Grill proves a more-than-welcome respite from the ordinary. And Zeitouni Grill does not disappoint.  The platters are always a good option. Choose from a trio of Shishes (I just made that word up) - Kabob, Tawooq, or Kefta - or the Shwarma (the \"Avengers\" Special! - You know what I'm talking about!), and you get your choice of two sides - hummus or babba ghanouj (neither will disappoint) and either tabbouleh, fatoush, or the Mediterranean salad. Personally, I love their falafel. I haven't had decent falafel since I left NYC, and this is about as close as what I used to sample when I slummed it on Lexington Avenue near Kips Bay. Simple fare, yet colorful and plenty flavorful, just as I would expect from this kind of cuisine.  Keep in mind this place stays busy during weekday lunch hours, so be prepared to wait about 10-15 minutes for your plate. Worth the wait, though.  I'm here about once a week. But this place is so damned good, I might be coming here more than once a week. I think the shish tawooq is calling my name.",

My first impression of Zeitouni is a good one, they have a good basis of food.  Now, they need to work on the atmosphere just a bit. I could eat there often; it looks like a great variety of more healthy and more indulgent items; it would be hard to get 'fatigue'. I wasn't hungry enough to sample a platter, so I only had the falafel appetizer. Their recipe is excellent, and the item was nicely presented with some pita, tomato and sauce.  My lunch mate offered a stuffed grape leaf to me as well.  The dolmas are warm here, which was not expected and the filling is creamy and soft (a little mushy for my liking). Everything was well-seasoned. I will definitely go back and try more at this no-frills eatery.",

    "text": "I'm completely enamored with Zeitouni's simplicity. By far one of the best Med restaurants I've visited in quite some time and at a pricepoint that is hard to beat. We've passed by this joint on multiple occasions and, by the number of outstanding reviews, we couldn't wait any longer.   When I say simple, it's in the best way possible. Not glitz and glamour for Z's. A few simple murals on the wall depicting a map of northern Africa and most of the Mediterranean...and that's about it. It's all about the food here. Just how it should be.   The staff is very kind. Even courteous enough to ask if you've ever \"experienced Mediterranean food before\" and walk you through the different preparations and choices. Much of which can vary slightly, but always good for a refresher.   Onward to the meal! My wife got the Falafel platter. Perfect orbs of crispy outside and warm, soft, flavorful inside. Not dry and also not overly moist. Topped generously with a mix of veggies and fantastically mixed tabbouleh. Finally! A place that uses bulgar wheat! The pickled veg was incredible.   I ordered the mixed platter. All three skewers they have with a dashingly colorful salad and pita/hummus. The chicken by far has the most flavor. Charred bits from the grill and marinated in something that fell from the heavens. The lamb and beef skewers also retained a ton of flavor. All of the spice mixtures are pungent but not overpowering. Perfect balance from three equally delicious animals.   The place is clean, busy, simple and has flavors that will make you think you're chillin in Tel Aviv. Can't wait to go back and get the Shawarma platter!",

Their food is always fresh, and their chicken kabobs are grilled to perfection, lightly charred on the outside and moist in the middle. Their Gyros are the best I've ever had. They come fully loaded with pieces of shaved beef and lamb,  diced tomatoes and the greatest tasting tzatziki sauce to ever cover this middle eastern taco. Everything  seems to be made in house, hence the freshness. Therefore, depending on how busy they are; expect to wait anywhere from 10 to 20 min to get your food. It's worth the wait. The food quality and flavors here blow Zoe's kitchen out of the water any day.",

With that said, I eat lunch here 1-2 times a week and I've been told I'm their most regular customer.  You just can't get better food for this price, not in Ballantyne.  Consider the fact that Chick-fil-A and other fast food costs about the same.  Not only that, but this place is pretty healthy which is another reason why I eat here so frequently.  Most of the food is grilled and made of quality meats and ingredients.    Favorite Lunch Items: 1.  Kefta Sandwich 2.  Chicken Gyro Sandwich 3,  Shish Kabab Sandwich  I typically go for hummus with meditterean meals but Zeitouni's is nothing special.  The hand-made french fries, however, are pretty awesome.  Recommendation:  Make a \"real gyro\", which I have yet to find in Charlotte.  I'm a huge fan when this is done right and the only way is to use a vertical rotisserie -which I understand is an issue considering Charlotte's stringent sanitary ratings.  I just hate it when places use frozen meat, which I'll admit you don't do with any other items.  This is what holds me back from rating Zeitouni 5 stars.  Honestly, as a business decision I don't know that I would considering how popular the restaurant already is and the previously mentioned sanitary issue.",

We found their food to be incredibly salty - to the point where the potatoes were inedible.  The falafel wasn't terrible, but it was a bit greasy and very crumbly. An attempt to get it on a fork resulted in it breaking into smaller and smaller pieces until I eventually just scooped up the crumbs.  To top it all off, every table in the place was dirty, as was their display cases and the floor. (Though to be fair, it looks like they were in the middle of a rush from the Gymboree class next door, so perhaps it would have been better an hour earlier or later.)  Finally, when I got home, I noticed they over-charged my credit card by $3.   I was excited that there might be another good place for hummus and falafel in town, but I'll be sticking with Kabob Grill. We won't be going back here.",

But Zeitouni's hit the nail on the head!!!  So scrumptious!  The platter comes with a 2 sides...basically hummus and a small greek salad.  Everything was excellent.  The hummus was creamy and I don't know what all they use but it was just very good.  The falafel bites were fried to perfection, and the tahini dipping sauce was awesome.  The salad was weak in terms of size but it was still very good.  The pita bread that was served was also weak but I will let that slide.    Overall, booming place.  Everything looked good, smelled good and was good.  Not a lot going on in this shopping center but you can stop in at earth fare before or after if needed!

Other than that, however, not bad. Place is a tad cramped but I'm all about the food and that's where Zeitouni draws its highest marks. We had the lamb kebab with baba ghanouj, and a lamb shawarma pita sandwich. All tasty although I wish the pita bread was warm and/or toasty (personal preference though). Glad I tried the joint out. Not exactly memorable but certainly good enough to satisfy my Mediterranean itch when needed.",

The falafel had a nice complex flavor, with a touch of cinnamon. Shawarma was fresh and savory. I never had potato harra before, but was pleasantly surprised by the tart and garlicky flavor. The fatoush had a nice sumac dressing, that was on the salty side, but I prefer my fatoush that way. Would have liked more vegetables in the fatoush, but it was a side salad with the mezza platter, so it may not be the norm if you order the dinner size salad. Compares very well to the Lebanese restaurants I frequent in northern NJ. I highly recommend.",

The only downside is Friday nights - we've been a few times and they've run out of hummus!!! A mediterranean place without hummus is disappointing - but the babbaghanoush is solid and the falafels are also very good. Grape leaves are a little soggy compared to what we loved in little Greece in NYC, but trust me, this place has won our hearts and we hope they stay for a very long time. Excellent baklava for dessert too!!!",

Number 1- It was empty at dinner time..that should have told me something..Number 2 -The food is just not up to Par,,,,Just not great or memorable. We sampled a lot of the menu again. The tablouli is all parsley, no Bulgar wheat at all, it was actually the best dish of all the things we tried. The Falafel was over fried and tasted like it was stale. The Gyro was so skimpy on the amount of meat, I was very surprised, it was all lettuce and tzatziki sauce. We had the Potatoes Harra, which was fried potatoes with Lemon, garlic and olive oil, they would probably have been good if they were warm..it was just room temperature and they also tasted old. The Baba Gohnuji was creamy and had a nice smoky flavor. The thing I cant understand is that if there was no one in their why wouldnt the food have been freshly made..it was like some Lebanese Aunt came the week before and they were heating up all the food she made. Just not very good at all....Sorry....",

Those who have sweet tooth or even those who don't, every one should definitely taste this sweet little thing.  Chicken kabob was so delicious. Shworma and baklava too. I ordered grape leaves too on the side; but I got little disappointed with this. This looked very cute and tasty was the stuffing. But when took overall bite it was very, very I mean very sour and vinegary. ( be careful while you order this its very sour) . I liked baklava so much that i would be wanting to come again just to have it.:)",

Normally when I'm going out to eat I like to sit down and look over a menu, especially in places like this where the menu may look a little different. However, that does not stop me from coming here. The food is absolutely delicious and spiced to perfection. I've never been to Lebanon let alone to anywhere in the middle east, but this place will instantly take your taste buds there.   Let's talk customer service. My friend ordered the wrong plate (kind of a newbie) and so when she went to order what she actually wanted they did not charge her. Hey, a girl can confuse gyro with chicken. Right?",

Living in the south Charlotte suburbs has proven a challenge for us. But Zeitouni Grille is a welcome addition to our list.   Their Falafel is totally vegan (as it should be), made in the Lebanese tradition with pickles and a bit of spice. Really nicely done. Tasty, inexpensive and fast. There are other vegan-friendly menu items, as well, although we've been a bit obsessed with the falafel.   AUTHENTIC Lebanese cuisine! I highly recommend this place!",

Cons, Babaganouj was very garlicky, Gyro was not freshly sliced beef, just a couple of slabs of meat and some very heavy tzatziki, so one bog heavy soggy mess that was inedible.",

Be warned there is little seating and it will be tough for groups larger than 4 to be seated during busy times.  Food was ready quickly, only a few minutes after ordering.  My falafel sandwich was good though I would have liked a few more falafel in the sandwich.  There were as much pickles and tomatoes as there was falafel which seemed unbalanced.  My wife had the chicken gyro which was also good though light on the chicken.  The hummus side was tasty but very little pita was served with it and what we did get was cold.  If the pita were warm and a few more pieces all other issues would have been forgiven as the hummus was delicious!  If the were thing we could say about the place was that we wanted more of the food, that is a good sign.  We be coming back regularly.",

My only criticism is that it doesn't feel the most welcoming, staff will greet you but aren't involved with much else beyond the counter.

Even though it's $1.50 for a little square piece, it's definitely very worth it.   I ordered the shish kabob platter with the Mediterranean salad and Babba ghanouj. The meat was a bit over cooked and very chewy. The salad was good but tasted very acidic. The babba ghanouj, which is an eggplant dip was just ok. Overall, I wasn't that impressed with this platter.  I did like that the menu gave descriptions of the items of their menu. It helped me a lot when deciding what to order. I don't think I'll be back here but if I come back, it'll be for the baklava!",

    "text": "OK, I'm at work, and should be productive, doing newsy thing, but I just got back from dinner break here, and MUST take 5 minutes write a review, I'm so thrilled.    Zeitourni Grill opened in July, but it's tucked away in the Earth Fare shopping center in Ballantyne, next to the Dippin' Dots, so it's easily overlooked.  (This was the former location for Quizno's).   When I walked in, a super cute woman was at the counter, and helped me make some suggestions on what to try.  I went with the kofta skewer and chicken platter, which I chose to have with babaganoush, and Mediterranean salad. Added a side of falafel. My dining partner had the kibbie.   Can I just say, my Middle Eastern (this cuisine is Lebanese to be exact) experiences in Charlotte have now reached a fever pitch with Kabob Grill being pretty good...then La Shish Kabob being excellent, and now ZG, my all-time fave in the city.    The chicken is so tender, so well seasoned...the kofta isn't dried out like most places and crusty, it's springy and moist.  The kibbie, I'm told is new and improved with more spice and is worth trying if you've never had it before.  Falafel side...two nice pieces, crispy fried, and drizzled with tahini and comes with pickled vegetables.   Platters come with dessert too, so we had two small baklava-esque pastry...extra crisp and flaky, fresh and sprinkles with pistachios.  The perfect two-bite size to end a meal.   The atmosphere is not shady like La Shish (of course it's not, it's in a spankin' new looking Ballantyne shopping center) and the inside is immaculate.  The owner was super sweet, seemed like an older man you want to sit down with and learn his life story.    Overall, it's a great casual eatery (order at the counter, wait for food type of joint) where the prices are pretty good.  (Our platters were $9.99 each, including the dessert.) I'll go back for sure when the craving hits!",

We have been here countless times and have always ordered the same thing - chicken kids meal minus the fries and drink but with a side of tabbouleh. Today I was told no we can't do that! I explained we always order the same thing every time was told, No! The manager looked right at me and said NO, then hung his head down and wouldn't look at me.   He didn't offer any solution! He could of said well I am sorry but we can do that but we can... Or we can but its going to cost a little more, just a flat at No we can't to that! I waited for a solution, but he was unresponsive.   Total lack of customer service and no healthy options for children! Only fries as a side for kids - I am sure in Lebanon they don't just give fries to kids.  Restaurants should offer healthy options or substitutions for kids not just unhealthy fries. To be blunt parsley, tomato, onions, mint &  bulgar is not pricey!   My 18 month old loves tabbouleh, kibbeh, falafel, & hummus.  After we were refused service we went over to the Kabob Grill in Ballantyne and they gladly served my 18 month old chicken and tabbouleh,  (subbing the fries) no questions asked. The server even commented how well she ate.   Needless to say we will not be returning to the restaurant due to the extremely RUDE service and lack of management skills.  I recommend you check out the Kabob Grill in Ballantyne or Dilworth. There is also a wonderful Arabic restaurant in Matthews Kabab the owner is from Beirut and is very customer service orientated.",

I recommend calling ahead to avoid waiting, the guy who usually answers the phone and runs the register does a great job.  I waited a long time to write this review and give out my secrets about how amazing this place is, hope you enjoy it too.",

Upon walking in I got the sense this place is popular based on the number of people in line and waiting for food.  That was probably the biggest drawback, the wait.  But the chicken I added to my greek salad needed time to cook I suppose so that was ok.  They did mess up my buddy's order so that wasn't exactly a good thing though.  My salad was great, fresh and cheaply priced in my opinion.  If you're coming in here for the atmosphere or the interior feel, you may, no you will be dissapointed.  I took my order to go.",

The fattoush is some of the best I've had and the dressing is just right. The pita could have been fresher.  After I finished, I ordered the kibbie special to go for my husband. The guy asked me if I'd had it before, and I told him I had and didn't like it. Now I know that I didn't like the kibbie I had before. THIS kibbie, I like.",

    "text": "I don't wanna bury the lede, so lemme just start with FALAFEL. Now that that's over...  I was running errands the day before Thanksgiving and needed some grub. Zeitouni's been on my target list for awhile, and I got there around 12:30. I waited at the counter for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me; to be fair, the four guys behind the counter cooking were slammed, but it was a little annoying. That's where the annoyance ended.  I ordered the shish kabob platter, and the man who took my order asked if it was my first time. When I said it was, he said I had to go with the shish tawooq. I'm never one to question the best a restaurant has to offer, so I went with it! It came with a salad and a dip, so I went with hummus for the dip and asked to substitute falafel for the salad. Best decision I made all day (all month?).  I grabbed one of the few remaining tables, and they brought out my plate just a few minutes later. The man wasn't lying about how good the shish tawooq was - the chicken was grilled to perfection, moist (I know, I hate that word, too), and deeeeeliciously seasoned. However, the falafel was SO good that I debated most of the time I ate about whether I should eat them both first, eat one first and then save the last one, or try to save them both for last. I went with the bookend strategy. The hummus was perhaps the best I've ever had, but the pita was thinner and chewier than I'm used to. Not my jam but y'all might like it that way.  All that and a water cost me about $11.50, and it was worth every penny.",

You can't go wrong with their hummus. Very fresh and made in house. I cannot seem to get enough of their falafel. They're crispy and not greasy and have a great flavor. I always have to order one of their salads. The tabouli is just so good and refreshing. We always order a fatoush salad and add grilled chicken to it to share.  The sandwiches and platters are all amazing and you honestly cannot go wrong. My husband always orders kefta either in a sandwich or on one of the platters. All of the meats are deliciously marinated, juicy, and cooked in front of you on the grill. The only drawback for me is that they are closed on Sunday. Order yourself a coffee and a piece of baklava to round out your meal and all will be well!",

I've been here before but wasn't such a foodie back then.  We came here for lunch takeout and work. I ordered the shwarma platter which came with beef pieces slice stewed in tahini sauce with onion and tomato with pieces of pita bread with babba ghanouj( eggplant dip) and tabbouleh(minced parsley salad).  It was incredible. Such simple ingredients combined in a complex manner with amazing flavor. It really felt like True Mediterranean. It was hot and ready in 20 minutes. Prices were very reasonable for quality and quanity.  I was impressed.   I got the dolma( stuffed grape leaves) as s side and they were authentic and stuffed and rolled jusy right.  My buddy got the gyro platter with the humus and Mediterranean. And my other buddy got the shwarma platter with the same with a side of falafel and they both love it.  Will definitely be back for more.",

Quantities and bread were somewhat lacking.  Everything was tasty but we have been spoiled by the plethora of other Lebanese/middle eastern restaurants in Charlotte, namely Kabob Je Rotisserie.  It also attracts a diverse following but has also much better bread baked continually in a centrally located stone oven (and included in the price of an entree), much more appealing plating, presentation and atmosphere, and is a much better overall value.  Still, if you are in a bind for time and have yen for kabobs, this place is definitely work a try.",

When I got home the sauce had turned to buttermilk. It literally tasted as if it was spoiled. The Humus was fair (I have had way in better other places) and the pita bread was skimpy at best.  The thing I noticed the most was the lack of customer service. It was like the staff didn't really want to be there. Other customers were complaining about the wait and the only response they got was \"It will be right up\". I saw one couple just get up and leave. All in all there are much better places to enjoy Greek and Mediterranean food in the Charlotte area, so I would give this one a pass.",

The food is delicious and no matter what you order, you are not left with the heavy feeling you get at other restaurants.  We usually get a combo, mine with a salad and his with a sandwich and it comes out to $21.  It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it for the taste.  The baba ganoush has a deep smokey flavor, almost like they have added liquid smoke, and we love it.  I always opt for the grape leaves and they are perfect every time.  Coming from a restaurant family, I do notice is seems as though the drink machine could always use a better wipe-down, or at least more frequently, but that is a minor complaint.   We would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for something different and we will keep going as long as their doors stay open and they don't increase their prices!",

They also have a mixed platter that lets you try several of their meats with baba ganoush and tabouli which is very good. Lots of fresh meats vegetables and spices. And the staff is really great. I wish the atmosphere was a little different. It's a tad cramped and the lighting is too bright but that's being real nitpicky. Definitely worth your while if you are looking for unique cuisine that's budget friendly.",

I did not see a large kitchen skewer for them to trim the seasoned meat from, so assumed it was in the back of the house. The meat came without rice and was grilled with more of a barbecue taste than traditional shwarma. They asked me to choose two sides and told me they were out of baba ganoush. I chose hummus and fatoush. There was no parsley to garnish the fatoush or hummus. The dressing on the fatoush was closer to Italian than Lebanese. The hummus was bland. The restaurant was simple and clean with more of a sandwich shop feel. No hot Arabic tea - or any hot drinks were available. I would call this an American influenced Lebanese and not authentic. The cook/waiter was very polite and helpful. Rating this on authentic food quality I can only offer 3 stars. As a little short plate restaurant I would give it 4 for its attempt.",

Some places tend to cut back on quality once the business is rolling for a while, but I've been going to this place since they opened, and thankfully thus far, it doesn't seem like they've fallen into that all too common mistake.

I had the beef and chicken Schwarma along with a Gyro, yes I was hungry.  Luckily I did order all that food as it was delicious.  Can't forget the baklava one of the best I have tasted.  It was crunchy as it should be and just sweet to the bite.  Great dinner that was well enjoyed by the family.",

The Lebanese version of this sauce is AMAZING.  The pita bread is always soft and the sandwich is to die for.  Also, the Shish Tawooq sandwich is basically a marinated chicken chunk and pickled veggie roll-up sandwich....kinda like a burrito but better.  The best part is the garlic mayo that comes on it....TO DIE FOR.  Get extra to dip the sandwich in.  Give this place a try, the high ratings are legit and the food is different but extremely addictive.",

The falafel did not have much flavor and there was a lot of pita bread. They had some sort of Tahini  or hummus in the pita that again wasn't very flavorful. Also, the fries tasted like frozen.

So when my mom and I had made plans to go the Ballantyne Hotel for a spa day, this was a clear choice for our pre-spa lunch. It had been quite a while since I had been and while I do realize this is not the best Mediterranean food on the planet they have a very solid offering and do some of these extremely well. I love the option of the platters since I can never pick only one thing to order and I like being able to try a bunch of different things. For the platters you get to choose 1 out of a couple of proteins, 1 dip (hummus or babba ghanouj), and 1 salad.  My mom and I got a falafel platter with hummus and fatoush salad and one with shish tawooq (grilled marinated chicken), babba ghanouj, and tabbouleh and shared so we could try a bit of everything. The presentation of the falafel platter was really nice, not sure why they didn't do the same thing for the chicken platter but oh well. Everything was very good and while not as inexpensive as other comparable mediterranean spots it was a reasonable price for the amount of food that you get. The standouts were the tabbouleh and the babba ghanouj. I probably wouldn't get the hummus again though as it was rather bland. Usually I am a falafel girl but the chicken was the better of the two proteins. Only other note is that they should probably give a little more pita bread on the platters. I will be back again for sure next time I am in the Ballantyne area.",

Paid for extra pita as 4 triangles are never enough!  However, they don't toast or warm the pita when served with hummus.  (The gyro pita IS warmed/toasted)  This ruined it for me.

    "text": "I stopped in on the recommendation of a neighbor.  The atmosphere was more Subway than exotic but the food and service was all that and a bag of chips.  I started with a side of Babba Ganouj as an appetizer.  It was so creamy and tasty with the pita bread, I could have made a meal out of it.  Next was a combination platter that included three kinds of meats.  Shish Kefta, Shish Tawooq, and Shish Kabob.  The meats were accompanied by Fatoush (a salad of greens, tomatoes and pita chips) and Hummus.  The meats were seasoned very well and were extremely tender and juicy.  The salad had a complexity of flavors accented with Mint and spices.  I really liked the flavor combinations.  This was my first time really experiencing Middle Eastern food.  Iman, the owner, spent time explaining the dishes to me and explained that this is authentic and cooked just like the old country.  No dumbing down or \"Americanization\" of the food here. It's the real deal!  One of the things I'd like to see them add to the menu would be lamb.  This would really round it out.  I'll be back!!",

Guess I won't derail the train on that... my only complaint is the classification here on Yelp of this restaurant being in the \"Quail Hollow\" neighborhood.  Although it's not officially Ballantyne... it's closer to there than Quail Hollow.  Anyway... we just stopped there for a quick lunch pick up and got the Shawarma \"sandwich\" and a Gyro and both were VERY GOOD!!  My only regret was not getting a second Shawarma or fries to go with it.  It was delish!!  The Gyro was loaded with meat and very nicely seasoned.  We will be going back there again... and again.",

Overall I enjoyed the food but it was definitely not the best I've had. I was born and raised in Chicago and we're known for our food. After moving to Charlotte, I know why people have been saying this. Good food is hard to find in Charlotte.  The kefta, fatoush and hummus were all pretty good but the rice was *plain* and the bread was thin and limp much like a tortilla. The other thing that annoyed me was that they piled everything high onto a small plate. Service was good, nothing to mention there but they are really nice people.  If I cannot find another place, this might end up as my go-to for now. If this place was in Chicago it would be a place I would visit only if I were in the area.",

Based on the reviews for Zeitouni, I decided to give it a try.  This was a True disappointment.  The shwarma platter was $10.99 and looked like a kid size portion.  The shwarma sandwich was actually more food than the platter and much cheaper.  Sadly, the food was luke warm, and the pita that the sandwich was wrapped in actually felt like they had just pulled it out of the cooler--it was cold, which subsequently made the meat cool quickly.  The fattoush salad was not much more than some iceberg lettuce with feta crumbled on top, and it was dripping in dressing.  The young man who took our order at the register was all business, which is fine, but a smile and a friendly greeting would have been nice.  All in all, this is fast food masquerading as Mediterranean, but priced like a mid-level restaurant.  Also, the pictures don't look anything like what is actually given to you.  I won't be going back.",

I judge Mediterranean restaurants hard core on their falafel and theirs passed with flying colors. The falafel had great crunch and amazing flavor. The gyro meat also was very flavorful! The basically melts in your mouth. I was overwhelmed with the portions and had to take a good amount home.   I was hoping that my meal came out on one of the wooden boards but it didn't.

    "text": "Ahhhhhmazing!!! I'm so in love with this place. The customer service, the workers, the music playing in the background, the food - it's all good! They have a very simple menu of the most popular Mediterranean / Greek food items and a description of them in case you weren't familiar with the cuisine.   My son loves gyros and we had time to kill so we stopped in for lunch. There's an open flame grill cooking your meats to order right in front of you. You order at the register and have a seat, waiting for the food to come out. I ordered the Mixed Grill which came with 3 different meat kabobs over rice along with a side salad and baba ganouj (roasted eggplant dip.) my son ordered a gyro with hummus.  We fell in love at first bite. My son ate ALL of his food and took some of mine too. Growing teenage boys have an insatiable appetite! Let me tell you about my food - all of It was so friggin delicious. By far the BEST kabobs I've ever had in Charlotte. The steak was tender, the chicken was full of flavor and so moist but the best kabob was the minced meat. I think it was a lamb and beef mix - yummy yummy. We cleaned our plates. I mean, we literally polished our plates clean. It was that good. My only gripe is that they're all the way in Ballantyne which is a good 45 minute drive from home. Maybe that's a good thing cause if they were any closer, I'd be spending way too much money there. Their portions are filling but it's so good that the greedy part of me would just keep eating even after I'm full. Which is what happened today.",

The portions are incredibly small for the prices that they charge. The side orders are served in very small styrofoam bowls. None of the staff with long hair handling food had their hair mesh on. Make sure that you ask for a receipt and read it because the owner will avoid giving it to you and will most likely charge you for something that you didn't order; especially if your party is more than two.",

It is a \"stand in line, pay, then sit and wait for the food\" place which I prefer since you don't have to figure cost of up.  Firstly,  falafel!! This is the best falafel ever, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, perfect flavor and texture and what presentation! I couldn't believe these pictures here weren't stock photos but everything coming out was gorgeous. The gyros were perfect, if I had to say something I would say I don't care for feta on the gyro, I've never seen that and now I know to ask for none on mine. The hummus was beautiful and silky, tabouli perfectly tasty. I can't wait to try more!",

Some of the best Greek/Lebanese food in Charlotte.  I know the following to be True...the meat (all types) is flavorful and never tough; it's absolutely delicious. Even the bed of jasmine rice is delicious on its own. The tabbouleh is awesome and refreshing and their Mediterranean salad is just as good as any. The hummus and pita bread are a some of the tastiest I have ever had. One piece of advice...GET THE POTATOES.   It's nothing you haven't had before, but it's done to very well every single time you eat here. It's usually pretty fast unless you're going during peak lunch hour. You will never have to wait long any time after 1-2PM. My only complaint is that it's very small inside and does not have tons of seating available.   Try it out and you won't be disappointed. 5/5 because they know what they are and consistently execute.",

As a result, Detroit also a wide array of great Middle Eastern restaurants.  So one could imagine how disappointing it was to land in Charlotte 5 years ago only to find there weren't any really good Middle Eastern restaurants.  (Or if there were, they certainly weren't anywhere near me.)  I had the opportunity to try Zeitouni last week.  Would have loved for this to be more of a sit-down, waiter service place where I could comfortably stay for a while in a booth and have rounds of food brought to me.    But no big deal.  Ordering at the counter was easy and the staff was friendly.  The food is prepared right in front of your eyes so you can see that it is made to order and fresh.  My meal took maybe 10 minutes and was hot, fresh and...DELICIOUS!  I ordered a falafel sandwich combo that included a drink and a side of hummus.  In addition I ordered a greek salad.  The falafel was cooked to perfection. Not mushy or overdone.  Simply perfect.  And the tanhini was applied judiciously, adding some nice nutty flavor to the dish without dripping all over my hands.  The hummus was rich and creamy (perhaps not as much garlic as I like), but just so FRESH.  And the salad was great.  An abundance of crumbled feta cheese and a really wonderful dressing on top of fresh lettuce and green pepper.    I will definitely be back.",

They were able to get the bitterness out of the eggplant and it was extra creamy.   The portion was huge, I was able to have left overs for lunch - there is a bargain in its self.   Places like this is allowing me to have faith in the flavors of the QC -- we may never have an authentic Mexican restaurant, but here my friends you will find the real deal.",

Listen yelpers:  Do you really want rice with that!???  No! ! !  Get something GOOD!  Potatoes Hara is my suggestion or maybe you could have an original thought, NO don't do that, copy me, PLEASE Copy Me and ask nicely : \"would you please substitute the Rice for Potatoes Hara\"?  You will not have to drop my name... They know me as Matt (not Super Drew, just Matt and not Just Matt... Matt... Matt who likes Hat (s)K!  I have eaten almost everything on the menu and I have eaten almost all of it twice.  Wraps are Good, Kabobs are BETTER!!!   Fattoush was A-OK better than many!  Tabouleh has been prepared to order each time.  I have heard that it is better (proper) to have it this way, as opposed to pre-made.  All the Desserts are Good or Better... get the Baklava!   Lebanese Coffee, they say (like Turkish Coffee with Cardamom).  So it is Better than \"Turkish Coffee\", because I like the Cardamom (Might make a List about it)... Since this is MY review I do not need to say \"it is my opinion\" this is MY Review!   It takes me about 6 hours to drink one serving (you get TWO) and I can not spell anythij for the rest of the day... My Doctor said it is common, though not as common, which is a GREAT way to say Rod0, you are a weirdo, hmmm, ok, I'll take that as a compliment!",

    "text": "I had been asking the Mr if we could come here for quite a while. During a foray into the adjacent Dippin Dots, I saw people filing into this joint and thought it was worth a yelpy lookup. It has deservedly acquired four and a half stars from the yelp community and here's why:  * Education: They take the time to explain the meat/entree offerings in a way that doesn't demean, but offers insight into which you might prefer. You can also see the skewers of meat right in front of you in a visually *enticing* cooler. They also have detailed explanations of all those tongue-twisting Mediterranean food descriptors, e.g. shawarma, fatoush, tabbouleh...  * Variety: Please note that vegetarians can actually grow both fat and happy here. From a simple hummus to lumps of perfectly crispy falafel or perhaps baba ganoush, eat your fill. As I didn't sample the meat options (we all know why), I had to depend on the Mr's refined palate, which suggests that the chicken skewers are the way to go. They also serve Lebanese beer and wine. Cheers!  * Atmosphere: It's Mediterranean quick-casual. FINALLY. You don't have to go somewhere promising Friday night belly dancing in order to partake in this savory, fresh fare. I, whose belly will remain shirted, am delighted about the atmosphere. Nothing at all fancy here. Simple plates, self-serve soda/tea fountain, friendly staff (who recognized us when we returned only two days after our initial visit).  * Food: Delicious. An excellent choice for a Ballantyne-area lunch or quick dinner that won't leave you feeling bloated and ready for a nap. Great value as well. I'll probably not order falafel anywhere else, because my poor, spoiled taste buds would likely revolt.  All in all, this spot is definitely worth a visit. If you live in the area, it's an added bonus. No frills, just great Mediterranean food. Enjoy!",

    "text": "My husband has been jonesing for Zeitouni ever since he started reading the reviews here on Yelp. We went a couple of weeks ago on a weeknight, and I have to say, I'm impressed.  Having traveled to Italy and Greece, we are not strangers to Mediterranean food. Still, it was refreshing to have one of the young men in the restaurant meet our eyes as soon as we walked in, and ask if we'd like an explanation of their menu. He took us over to the case and showed us their kabobs, as well as their sides. He explained how we could order the different combinations, and then left us to confer amongst ourselves.  We each ordered a platter. I ordered the chicken kabobs, my husband ordered the trio of kabobs. We ordered different sides in order to sample them all: hummus for me, babba ghanouj for my husband.  We sat down to wait at a table, and after a few minutes they brought out our orders. Interestingly, our kabobs came with the wrong sides on the plates, but frankly this wasn't an issue since we were just doing a big old taste test of everything we could get.  An older gentleman (perhaps the owner?) came by to present me with a garlic aioli sort of dip for the chicken. It was DELICIOUS and so garlicky! We asked for more, and asked what they called it. \"Chicken sauce,\" he said, with a laugh as he gave away the secret recipe of garlic and fresh mayonnaise. I don't care how simple it was, I loved it.  The food was fresh and delicious. The staff was smiling and friendly. I couldn't ask for more from a restaurant. Well - maybe if it was sit down service with menus, but I won't dock them for that. Zeitouni is what it is - a counter service restaurant. Their food shines beyond \"counter service\" which implies almost a fast food style. Zeitouni is not \"fast food\" in my opinion. It's delicious, flavorful and fresh, designed to be savored. So it's a bit of a disconnect, but I forgive them for that because well, if you taste this food, you'd forgive just about anything else.  My recommendation for dining at Zeitouni is that you call ahead and order delicious meals to enjoy in your home. If you're looking for a tasty and fresh lunch, or out for a quick dinner, it's an okay place ambiance-wise, in which to enjoy it, but the fast food feel might turn you off for a date night out.   Regardless of how you enjoy their food, it is amazingly delicious food that is meant to be enjoyed. We'll be back again and again, but likely with a carryout bag to savor in our home. Zeitouni's food, and it's staff are elevated far beyond the atmosphere you'll find when you walk in.",

No pita bread, 2 olives, 3/4 of one slice of a cucumber, 1/2 of a slice of green pepper and 2 tablespoons of feta! This was their 'large' Mediterranean salad for $4.99. The gyro had two small pieces of lamb inside a big pita with sparce traces of feta. Luckily we bought the appetizer of 6 Grape Leaves (that were floating in olive oil), they were very good and luckily helped fill us up. Save your money and try one of the many Ballantyne area restaurants that will satisfy you for your hard earned money! Sorry Zeitouni Grill, we really want to like you but after several visits its just not worth the money!",

Husband and I each ordered the Vegetarian Mezza platter. I had the babba ghanouj and the Mediterranean salad and he got the one with hummus and tabbouleh. The grape leaves were the most disappointing item on the platter. For a restaurant that prides itself on freshness, the grape leaves were canned! When I'm in a pinch, I'll grab a can of stuffed grape leaves...so I'm quite familiar with the green oily look left on my plate. The tabbouleh wasn't that great either. Oh, how unfortunate! However, the potatoes were seasoned well, the pita bread was fresh, and the falafel was good.   On the bright side, the Turkish coffee was made fresh to order and paired nicely with the baklava. I highly recommend getting the two. In addition, the employees were very friendly and the space was small, very casual, and clean.   While I made a special trip this time, I don't see myself doing it again. However, I'm not entirely opposed to stopping in if I'm in the area, especially to get my Turkish coffee and baklava combo fix.",

    "text": "I set high expectations for this place due to my desire for great Mediterranean and the Mediterranean food that I've eaten in the past paired with the phenomenal reviews and ratings I've read and heard.  Don't get me wrong, food and experience was good and I'll be returning or considering it again in the future, but it won't be my go to spot or \"gotta have it again tomorrow.\"   I ordered the falafel platter. One of my choice extras was a Mediterranean salad- which was quite tasty, but was disappointed in the size. I was expecting a side salad portion, but in reality it was a to-go side in the meal container...so probably 5 small to medium bites. For my second option my choices were baba ghanoush (eggplant) or hummus. I opted for the baba, when I opened the platter I assumed they just gave me hummus because it was the consistency and color of hummus, but didn't taste like baba or hummus.. So I'm not sure what that was. That item was my least favorite. Now to the falafel! It was quite good. I enjoyed the seasoning and flavors, perhaps I tasted some mint. Very enjoyable! It came accompanied by some pita bread.   I also asked when ordering to make sure the yogurt cucumber sauce was in the platter on the falafel, they insured that it was included. No such sauce.. And that sauce is my fav. There was some tahini, which was good.  My co-worker ordered the grape leaves appetizer. They were presented well and she liked them.  Customer service and timeliness was excellent. Wassim rang up my order, no extra surprises. The bill matched what was quoted on the phone when I placed the order for pick-up. They are open until 9pm. It is close to my job. The restaurant is set-up cafe style. Bathroom was clean and stocked.   For any interested, they are currently hiring. Seek within.",

This is still my favorite spot for some quick authentic Mediterranean fare, after over 2 years of coming here.  I had lunch with a friend here today, and it was so good I'm craving it for dinner!  The baba ganouj (eggplant dip) as well as the chicken in my salad had yummy wonderful smoky flavor a from their wood grill.  I almost always get the same things, baba ganouj and either a Mediterranean salad with a chicken skewer for the perfect lunch or for something larger, the chicken gyros sandwich.   Also wonderful are the tabouli salad and hummus.  All the sauces, dips, and dressings are freshly made and full of flavor, and the meats are juicy and flavorful as well.   Anyone I've brought here has loved it as well.  The atmosphere is casual and full of light. A great place to meet with friends, take the kids, or bring a book and eat on your own.  I've done it all and felt equally comfortable doing it all. Highly recommended!",

To boot it was a rainy day which made the locale even more depressing. This place doesn't even have the charm of a dive because like much of Charlotte it's all brand spanking new.   The choices on the menu were limited, we ordered a few of our usual. The food was very good, as good as can expected for this type of place. I thought the prices were maybe a little high (for the venue) but not too bad. The service was unexpectedly slow but very friendly, we weren't in a hurry anyway. I'm deducting one star for the fast food cafeteria dining experience.   My constructive criticism of the day : get some window treatment, such as cafe curtains. Neither the view of the parking lot nor of the counter are much fun.",
