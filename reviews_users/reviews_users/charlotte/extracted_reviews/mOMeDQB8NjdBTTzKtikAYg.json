I always get the chicken and rice with queso. I also pair it with with cornbread stuffing and green beans. The cornbread stuff is very savory but it's a little heavy on the salt for me. The green beans aren't anything special. I wish they would give them a little love tho. I think they are out of a can from the looks and taste,but hey they are known for the roasted chicken so you know.",

While the vibe is a bit different, they have given the building a facelift and added a brew pub, the food taste and quality is just as I remember. Reasonably priced family food is not always easily found, so I was pleased. I don't know the next time I'll be back, but would definitely come around again the next time I'm in the area.",

When people are spending a lot of money at your restaurant you should not call the business and be rude about it when you mess up. Good restaurant. Obviously can't handle big orders.... We will be ordering catering from other places next time. Sad I had to change my 5 star review due to the way I and others here were treated.",

Bland Bland bullsht! Your food was awesome and I as a long time vegetarian so appreciated actually trusting that your side dishes were vegetarian!  I had the 4 sides and cornbread.  Squash casserole was dynamite and had beans, corn and greens!  Yum you guys!!! Thanks for being vegetarian respectable! I know my meat eating relatives loved the other food too!",

I ordered the chicken and black beans con queso, and it was good but nothing memorable. The chicken was pretty moist and had decent flavor, and was very good with the Tico sauce- which I'll admit is excellent! The black beans and rice were pretty bland and the queso was average as well. I also got a side of green beans that was okay and macaroni salad which was very good. Overall, I'd recommend the mac salad and the tico sauce on chicken but not much else stood out.",

Perhaps my tastes have changed in my old age.  Anything is possible.  Anyway, RC excels in their side items with many having a southern twist to them including mashed sweet potatoes, collards, etc.  For meals they feature tex mex items like burritos and then they also have rotisserie chicken.    They have a small salsa bar and a few sauces on the table.,  The hot sauce has a nice smokey flavor to it and goes well with anything you put it on.  The restaurant can get very busy at peak times so you may have to wait until at table is cleared before you sit down.",

Food - opted for the chicken & black bean combo platter w/ sweet potato mash and corn bread.  The meal is basically pulled chicken on a bed of rice that is drizzled w/ a, black in color, barbeque soy tasting sauce called Jaco sauce.  The flavor was okay but too salty soy for my liking.  The sweet potato mash was dark in color and kind of bland in taste.  The corn bread was just okay.  Service - Yep, at ordering you kind of feel obligated/ guilt-ed into tipping when basically you do all the work w/ the exception of clearing the table.  I would rather leave cash for the table cleaners on the table and not tip on the credit card receipt.  That way I know that they would truly get the tip.     Overall - It was just okay...nothing great.  I may give them another try if in the area but I would not go out of my way to stop here.",

Not sure what we were getting into, but we were ready for the challenge. As we drove up we noticed that the restaurant was pretty laid back and inviting. In this place you are the waitress. You put in your order at the window and wait for your name to be called for pick up. It's was almost like my mom calling me to dinner. All utensils napkins and drinks were at your disposal. This was odd, but I found it pretty cool and different. The food was great and piping hot. I ordered the 1/4 roasted chicken which was delicious. The pasta and cheese salad was the bomb! The greens were a little to tart for my taste ( just a table spoon or two of sugar will cut the bitterness) other wise my lunch was great. My daughter's  had the chicken and rice with black beans. They absolutely loved it. They had a variety of sides which consisted of yams, cornbread dressing, bake beans and potato salad. All were good, however the cornbread dressing was to sweet. Regardless, we had a ball and I will be back.",

I would not go far as to say that the sides are vegetables (or at least healthy ones) but they were so so so good! Yum!

In their defense I should've paid better attention to the description..it was shredded chicken with \"jaco\" sauce (which is BBQ sauce). It was what they said it would be..just sounded way better on the menu. But bad idea for a sandwich. The bottom bun was so soggy & heavy that it literally fell apart when I attempted to pick it up. It was at best an ok sandwich. The collard greens were meh, I've had WAY better. However my friends got a chicken wrap that looked ridiculous, and they said it was. So I'd give the food another chance.   The bar service was on time! We went to see one of our favorite local bands play, WICKED POWERS! Luckily for us they had $3 natty green drafts..yes please! The bartenders were quick & knowledgable. They only serve local on draft, not sure about bottled.",

I decided to wander through the neighborhoods looking for something a little more local and a little less factoryized.  I found it here.  The best I can say is The Roasting Company exceeded all my expectations. I like that they specialize in one thing (chicken) and they do it well. My 1/4 dark was moist and flavorful and the two sides were well worth trying.  I always try to sample New To Me dishes so I tried the Squash Casserole and Smoked Cheese Salad. I was happy with both. The casserole was helped out by the slight addition of hot sauce (Lisorno?) and the salad was just fine the way it was.  For southern-style grub this is a good as I've had and would definitely come back again.  Oh, by the way, my entire lunch including drink was under $10. A very good value.",

It looks like a dive.\"  Once we entered, though, you could immediately tell that it wasn't a dive.  It just has the poor luck of being in what appears to be an old small strip mall.    It's a good idea to pick up one of the menus as you walk in (and before you step up to the ordering counter) because there's a lot to choose from!  Their speciality is rotisserie chicken with a Mexican or Tex-Mex flair.  My favorite dish is the chicken and black bean combo con queso.  Why?  It's chicken, two sides/veggies, black beans, and cheese.  YUM.  Top that with one of their hot sauces and I've got a double YUM.  Now comes the difficult part:  deciding which two side items from the list of about 15.    Garlic or mashed potatoes?  Spinach?  White bean au gratin?  Baked apples?  AARGH.  I can't decide!  They all sound so good.  I've tried several over different visits and I can tell you that they're ALL good.  That makes it even tougher to decide.   The dining room is pretty casual and not overly themed, but i like the high-backed booths for some privacy.",

    "text": "Had a yummy, hearty dinner here last night.  The chicken and rice was recommended by the cashier, with a hearty sample. The chicken was so tender, it fell apart with a spoon! The jaco sauce was wowzers good!  I had a squash casserole which was topped and baked with breadcrumbs and was delish, however I didn't care too much for the basil green bens, that were mushy and tasted out of a can.  The service is counter order and self service, but they didn't have any trays, which made carrying dishes and drinks, and grabbing utensils a treacherous trip from the open kitchen counter to the table.   Will look forward to returning and trying out other dishes!",

I have had the pot pie - which is a special on Wednesday or Thursday, I think??  It had great flavor and it is HUGE!  I think it took me 3 days to finish.  My go to meal though has turned into the chicken on rice with con queso, which is what I had today.  The chicken has great flavor and of course so does the con queso.  My favorite sides are the squash casserole and the baked apples.  Large portions create for multiple lunches or sharing!  One other one that I have tried is the chicken and queso wrap - I think it is called this?  You are better off just getting the chicken with rice and queso, it is the same stuff stuffed in a wrap and it is huge - too much to hold in you hand and it falls apart.  Not sure about the other wraps, but to me, just avoid the wraps and ask for tortillas on the side of your meal to make your own small wrap.  Always have had great fast service and great food.  Love this place!",

Friendly service and a huge selection of delicious dishes will have you coming back for more. Chicken is a favorite here but you really cannot go wrong, everything on the menu is fantastic. Wednesday's are chicken pot pie days so you will definitely want to come then! It takes a bit longer to get the chicken pie as they are baked on demand and they may run out before the end of the night.  I gave this place 4/5 solely based on the food pick up on busy nights, the wait is long and it gets confusing on whose order is what.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much pork there was in relation to the serving of lettuce. I wasn't impressed with the dressing at all, but the salad was still very good.   My Daughter ordered the cheese quesadilla, with a side of garlicky new potatoes. She loved both, she even finished everything!  My Wife ordered the chicken taco platter, which was also very well received and enjoyed.  I was surprised that they weren't very busy, it was 12:30 on a College Football Saturday.

But PLEASE get the chicken con queso. It will change your life. For real for real.  Also, if you go around 5 or 6pm, prepare to wait if you don't call in your order. It's not a bad wait, but it's just a lot better to call in. You may hold, but the staff is VERY courteous and they will make sure you're taken care of.  And you get cornbread with every entree.. And cornbread is amazing.  Oh! And the bartender who is regularly there is awesome. Very knowledgable about beer, wine, and the food menu. So grab a drink and chat with him!",

It's always super fast and the atmosphere is nice.  The prices are also great, you can get a huge meal for under $10.  They also have a full service bar where you can order your food if you sit there.

Interesting variety of flavor here, ranging from tex mex (medium salsa) to cumin-y mexican (jaco). The unsalted heat of the pico was rad. There were even little packets of malt vinegar. Dude.  The collards were the highlight for me. Deeply smoky, bitter and tart, and just salty enough. Wolfed 'em down. Squash casserole was meh, but other sides, and the 3 pound veggie wrap, were all delicious and unique.

My wife and I both ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken (white) which came with cornbread and two sides. I got the baked beans and the special: spicy mac & cheese. The first thing I tried was the cornbread, and found it had jalapenos and whole kernels of corn baked in. I know some people really like the whole corn in the cornbread thing, but I'd rather keep my breads and vegetables separate. Next up was the spicy mac & cheese. I love mac & cheese, and I've become a big fan of having a bit of hot sauce added to give it some kick, so I was really excited about this. It certainly had the spicy; it had lots of jalapenos mixed in and was quite hot. What it was lacking was the cheese. There was no creaminess to it at all. The baked beans, however, were very good. They also had jalapenos mixed in (are you sensing a theme here?), but only had a subtle kick which was balanced with a slightly sweet tangy sauce. As for the chicken, the flavor was excellent but most of the breast was pretty dry. The wing, on the other hand, was quite juicy. If you're looking for really moist chicken you might have better luck with the dark meat. There were no jalapenos in the chicken.",

I got the chicken with rice, queso, and black beans with a side of sweet potato fries and a cornbread muffin.  It just wasn't packed with flavor the way I was expecting it to be.  The chicken part was kind of bland and definitely needed to be spiced up a bit.  Don't order their sweet potato fries if you're expecting them to be drizzled with a sweet or honey glaze.  I actually prefer mine salty but the pepper they add to their fries really threw me off.  The cornbread muffin wasn't too bad but it didn't stand up to my high cornbread standards.  I liked that the food came out pretty fast.  I also enjoyed the casual dining area. I was a little confused when we were finished eating because I had no idea what to do with my plate and glass.  This place doesn't have servers that come to the table so I was searching for a trash can to throw my stuff away but didn't see one.  We saw some other people leave before us that just left their used plates on the table so we followed suit.  I might come back to try out a different entree.  Hopefully this place has really good food and I just chose the wrong menu items.",

I've never had a bad...anything here.    The rotisserie chicken goes w/o saying, it's excellent and a natural first choice for the less adventurous.  The Jaco (say, HA-ko) pork anything is the tastiest, most tender pig you'll find this side of Eastern NC 'cue.

You can go here just for the vegetable options alone and be more than satisfied.  I've almost consumed the entire spectrum here except the coleslaw and it's all good.  The 'tops' are the Basil Green Beans, Herbed Rice, and Mashed Sweet Potatoes.  The Cinnamon Apples can be savored as a desert in itself!  The Stir Fry veggies would be the only mediocre item on the menu I've had, but even they're still tasty.    Bottom Line...Go...now...",

My co-worker loves this place, so we go at least once every two weeks.  I on the other hand am not a huge fan of their menu and how they prepare their foods.  At this place, you order your food at the counter.  Once your meal is ready (under three minutes in my experience), your name is called to pick up your plate.  One can opt to eat either inside or outside on their patio.  There are no trash cans; I leave my food on my table when I'm done...but I'm not waited on by anyone.  Am I expected to leave a tip...?  I have ordered a number of sandwiches and wraps from The Roasting Company.  The presentation of the entrees could not be better, however the quality and taste are negligible.  If you order a sandwich or wrap with any sort of sauce on it, you'll find that they include so much of it that your sandwich just falls apart and you make one hell of a mess.  Even on a sandwich without sauce, the chicken is so juicy to the point that the bread will act as a sponge and absorb all of it.  Nothing irks me more than soggy bread.  As for the taste, there is nothing special about their menu; you could make the same items at home (and likely not force yourself to contend with all the sog!).  I give them two stars for their killer sweet potato fries, despite the fact that they only make them on days of their choosing.",

    "text": "There have been some other eateries popping up right down the street on Montord, but this remains a gem. As someone who tries to eat semi-healthy and likes variety with my meal, this is the ideal place. And it's pretty affordable, in the $8-$10 range.  The main event here is chicken, with a bit of a latin twist. You can go the traditional Southern route with both how you get your rotisserie and the sides you choose. I like a little flavor kick, so I went with the Chicken and Black Bean combo, served over rice with that tangy jaco sauce. If you want to splurge calorically a bit, you can get the same thing with queso.  You can go sandwich style, or go for the platter. The platter is a great value, as it comes with cornbread and your choice of endless sides. You can sub in some tortillas if you want to tilt your meal further to the South.  There are many tasty sides, including mac and cheese, greens and many other staples. I went with the garlicky new potatoes and the special stir fry mix of vegetables, which included broccoli and squash. The veggies were fresh, and the potatoes were creamy. It will probably take a long time before you can try out every side here, but I really don't think you can wrong with any combo.  I like the fact that you order up front, and they yell out your name when it's ready, and be warned, the food gets ready fast. The only question with seating was the lighting, but then again, I think we kind of picked a bad spot and could have moved to a more open area. The soft drinks are only $1.25, and it's easy access for refills of soda. As someone who loves to experiment with sauces, I really dig the fresh salsa bar. That pico de gallo is spicy and excellent.  Overall, this is a great place. It always seems to be packed, so come during the slightly off-peak dining hours so you can order, find yourself a seat and be served quickly. As someone who lives in the 'hood, I look forward to many happy returns.",

The chicken is flavorful, the cornbread dressing is a little spicy, the wraps are awesome and the prices are just right.  Great when its cold out an you want to warm up for lunch.  Definitely a hearty meal.  I never care about decor, but if you are into a comfy atmosphere, this place might not be for you.  I could care less, all about food for this big girl.

We came here to meet some friends for beer specials (which are apparently very reasonable on Fridays) and shared a plate of nachos. Decently sized, but we had to put a lot of cholula and their habanero sauce on the chicken to give it some sort of taste.   Not my favorite, but that's okay since Viva Chicken opened up just a little ways down Park Road.",

I wasn't exactly sure of the ordering process when I stepped into the restaurant but quickly figured it out and went to the window on the right.  My buddies suggested I go with the chicken and queso.  I threw in the black beans too for the \"queso combo.\"  For my sides I got the oft-mentioned squash casserole and cole slaw.  The chicken, queso, and black beans was really good.  All of the flavors blended well but you could still taste each individual component.  I actually really liked the slaw too.  It was more tangy than sweet as some cole slaw can be.  I didn't love the squash casserole as much as others have but I thought it was good.  The woman who took my order was very nice.  Don't go in here looking for decor.  These folks focus on the food and do that well.  I look forward to trying more think from RoCo on future visits.",

    "text": "After a wry glance at each other after a workout, my wife and I decided it wasn't going to be a night we cooked in. I had passed by The Roasting Company a few times and had heard good things offhand, so I figured we would give it a try since it is right around the corner from where I live. Overall we had a great experience, pigged out on some delicious dishes, and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere.  Walking in is a little disorienting, as you have to go to the right and place your order. Almost all the dishes are inspired by their slow roasted rotisserie style chicken, which creates an intoxicating aroma as you pull into the parking lot. We ended up ordering the Chicken con Queso with sides of collards, squash casserole (our favorite!), and garlicky potatoes. In a style reminiscent of the backwoods eastern barbecue places I frequent back home, you wait for them to holler your name, then you smirk at everyone still waiting for their food as you make your way back to your table with your overloaded plate.   We ended up sitting at the bar and getting CCC's baby maker on special for $3.50 (FYI it's much more expensive if you buy it at the brewery). We weren't too terribly hungry so we split the meal, which was a great choice as they don't skimp out on portions. Overall everything was prepared wonderfully and I liked all of the selections we had made. Also for the price, you are getting a pretty good bang for your buck IMO. While the main dish was awesome, the sides stole the show. They always have around 20 sides available, so I look forward to trying some different ones in the future.  Fun Fact - If you aren't sold yet, it is also one of Luke Kuechly's favorite places to eat. He considers it a pre-game ritual to eat there the week before the game, and blames the Atlanta loss on his not dining at The Roasting Company for the first time that season. Not to worry though, The Roasting Company made sure to send him a bottle of their Tico sauce so he could keep the tradition before the Super Bowl. You can read the article in the Charlotte Observer.",

It is right around the corner from our neighborhood and I can't believe we have never been here before!! You walk up to the ordering area, order, then wait for them to call your name. They have a seating area and a full bar.   On the recommendations of another Yelpers review (thanks Marco!), we ordered the Chicken and Black Bean con Queso. This came with two sides and we got the collard greens and squash casserole. We also added on a side of potatoes. There were so many yummy sounding sides on the menu that it was hard to choose!   We grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a beer, while waiting for our food. The Triple C Baby Maker was on special for $3.50, which is an incredible deal! As this is one of my favs, beer wise, the choice was obvious!   The food came out and was definitely plenty for two people! The squash casserole was by far the winner!! The chicken and black beans con queso was a nice portion and consisted of rice, black beans, chicken, a bbq like sauce, and cheese all chopped up.   Definitely want to come back as they have daily specials for main courses and sides....mac n cheese, chicken pot pie, and chicken and dumplings were definitely some of the specials I want to return for!",

I lived in the neighborhood and would eat here regularly like 2-3 times a week. Imagine my surprise to find they had finally opened the place up and added a full bar and doubled the size of the menu, all to the betterment of their devoted customers.  I was all smiles when I saw that my all time favorite \"smoked cheese pasta salad\" was still featured, I got an extra order to take back to the hotel. The rotisserie chicken is still the star here, crispy on the outside, juicy and luscious in the inside. All the sides are great, there are 18 to choose from, something for everybody. Free refills, that beautiful classic salsa bar, and and endless supply of hot sauce and their special Tico sauce. The service is always fast, the food is consistently great, I never understood why these guys haven't expanded beyond Montford Drive because this business would thrive anywhere. Also a great place to watch a ballgame now since the expansion. Got a really nice vibe now.  BTW, I was amused at some of the negative reviews. Are you people insane? And BTW, occasionally Yelp does listen cause I flagged one review that raved about the food, but gave the restaurant one star because she had to \"refill my own tea\" so if you see any of your favorite places being abused like this please flag away, you never know.",

The fella and I stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday night, and we were a little confused when we first walked in. Yes, there's a big ol' sign right above your head that tells you to order at the counter, but still.  We ventured over to the counter and searched for a menu. The sides and veggies of the day were written on chalkboards, but no menu to be found except for the paper to-go ones. There were two cashiers, and I had to wait for them to finish talking to each other before one finally took my order.   I got the 1/4 rotisserie white meat chicken with rice and black beans, and the fella got chicken with jaco sauce and rice. There was SO much meat on my chicken!! And it was moist and delicious. My rice and beans were pretty tasty, too. I tried the fella's chicken since I had never had jaco sauce, and it was like a sweet, smoky barbecue sauce.   He wanted a drink, so we had to pay for our meal at the food counter, then head over to the bar to buy the drink, which was a little annoying. I think you can eat and drink at the bar to put everything on one check, but there were no seats there when we went. By the time we leave around 7 p.m., the place was hoppin'!   Overall, pretty delicious food, especially on a cold, winter night, but the service was a little iffy for me, so A-OK it is.",

I ordered the chicken on rice con queso with a side of collard greens and garlicky (their term) potatoes.   I was startled when a man screamed out my name.. apparently they do that every time someone's food is ready; if you have a heart condition do not stand near the counter..  The collard greens were good and so were the garlicky potatoes; I fear that the chef is afraid of salt though, as my entire dinner was lacking in overall flavor. There was barely any queso in my chicken on rice platter con queso and that is a major problem. Moreover, my entree was barely warm and the rice tasted rather old.  Service at the register was friendly and inviting, but the man at the counter gave me a bad attitude when I asked for a cup.  Overall, I would not come back to this establishment. The food was alright, the cost was too high for what it was, and the service was not the best.",

My husband had the marinated grilled chicken breast sandwich. It came with mayo, cheese, lettuce and tomato. He had the squash casserole for his side. He described it as good. My 9 year old son had the chicken taco kids meal with a side of chips and queso dip. The taco would have been enough for him. There was enough chips and queso that we all had a share and still had some to bring with us.",

I was disappointed in the lack of flavor to the chicken meat itself.  Also the sides were hit or miss, some were good, some  were too salty or too sweet.  I'll pass on this place...I like Viva Chicken better...I don't need the bar atmosphere as much as I need good tasty food!",

I don't know what they do to it and the sauce, but it rocks harder than Axel Rose high on an ounce of cocaine with 5,000 ten-foot-tall speakers and a subwoofer that runs on plutonium. It's basically a mix of teriyaki and barbeque sauce that you can slather on some pulled chicken and put on a sandwich or serve over rice (Central American style).  There's also beer galore. A few unique ones are on the list, like the locally-produced and hilariously-dubbed Babymaker IPA. Don't get me wrong: we're not talking World of Beer here. But, the list is still substantial and the prices are good: about $5 per sling of a glass of malty bread.  Service by a younger-looking server was attentive and knowledgeable. That matters to me and is a big reason I went with a five star review.  Atmosphere is chill, not really comfortable. But, it's a fun place, so who the fuck cares.  Bottom line, check it out. It is tops.",

I have been going here probably twenty years, since right after they opened when a roasted chicken was a novelty and before they were available un every grocery store. What brings me back is the many excellent veggie sides offered. I recommend the four cheese pasta, the white beans with garlic and the sauteed vegetables. But all are good and I have tried them all! The mini loaves of cornbread are cute and very good. And, of course, the chicken is always perfect, tender and moist consistently. I get the quarter chicken, and have sometimes gotten the entree with black beans. Everything is totally delicious here. I just wish they would clean and spruce up a little bit in the atmosphere. And sometimes tables are left piled with previous diner's leavings, so it's hard to find a clean place to sit. If the food were not so good that would turn us away.",

I rarely order chicken when I go out to eat but it seemed fitting at this location and I'm glad I did! It was delicious and moist and flavorful! Their sides were also delicious! Garlicky potatoes, baked beans and even the Dill Potato Salad was good. Their pork Tacos were great! Not stingy with the pork they were very juicy and filling.

The \"buttered\" spinach was awful, and the garlic potatoes were decent. Maybe we will give it another shot down the road...",

My suggestion for sides are the squash casserole and the white beans au gratin along with any chicken entree.    I've determined there are cracks in the fasod as the last visit the service had gotten really, really slow, as I ordered on line and even though they weren't busy, it took over a half hour to scoop up a veggie plate.  Realizing that the neighborhood has become millienumfied, they have added a bar and raised their prices where the value is not quite as good as it has been.  I realized that Doug the owner is spreading himself thin with the purchase of Providence Road Sundries and two other ROCO locations but come on this is in an old Lil Greneral C Store location so he needs to keep in sight on how this original location became successful in the first place.",

    "text": "Chicken Roasting Company is like your favorite pair of old jeans- soft, comfy, faded, make your butt look good (ok maybe a bit far). Anyway, it's the place you can go when you're so hungry you can't make up your mind what you want to eat. The place is casual, comfy and has quick counter service. There are a few outside tables, and a big tv always on sports. It's good for kids too.  The menu focuses on, er, chicken. My favorite is 1/4 white, With 2 sides. That means a 1/4 of a rotisserie roasted chicken (you can also get dark of even a half a chicken). each day in addition to their great regular sides, they  have a few special sides. My favorite special side is the spicy Mac & cheese only on Saturdays, but their regular sides of Tico black beans (which keeps turning into Ticonderoga on my iPad -DYAC!!), cornbread stuffing, sauteed veggies and mashed sweet potatoes are also great. In fact, the mashed sweet potatoes taste like pumpkin pie. Mmm, pie...There are some sides I don't love as much, so just find what you like.   The menu also offers a couple entrees like chicken and rice, wraps (veggie wrap is good but is juicy so maybe ask to go light on the dressing or on the side) all for very reasonable prices. The 1/4 white plate is $6.80. It is equally friendly to the pocketbook and the stomach.  The only problem? I don't live as close to Park & Woodlawn anymore, so it's not as convenient.   Bottom line: great place to get a solid meal for not much moolah when you're in your sweats.",

Come to find out, i place my order, then i pick up my own food and fill my own drink, grab my own silverware, and you want a tip for what? Ooooh, i see there is no place to throw away my own trash. i guess that makes me feel better for leaving some tip.     Anywho, walking in on a Monday to see that the special is a buffalo chicken wrap  felt like a good omen to me. Unfortunately, my wrap left me to continue my search for a favorite buffalo chicken wrap in Charlotte. At first, i thought they just forgot to put any buffalo sauce on it.  Perhaps they thought i ordered the bland chicken wrap instead? Then it started to have a little flavor, but not much and by the bottom of the wrap, it was a soggy diaper wrap. i tried to add flavor with various salsa and sauces on the table, but couldn't quite satisfy the taste buds.  The squash casserole was pretty good, but i found myself leaving half of it behind not even wanting to finish it. Same with the sweet potato fries, just kind of bleh.  My favorite part of the trip was when she put my order slip on the thing and threw it down the line to the cook dudes. i'm easily entertained.",

I got the squash casserole, the cheesy grits, the collards, and the green beans, and then because of a mixup I got the apples for free, those things are so good. The only thing I didn't really care for were the green beans, they seemed like they were from a can and I'm not a big fan of canned food. The prices were awesome- my plate came with a really good little cornbread muffin and was just over $5. If I lived in the area I would eat here often for sure. It also had a homey ambience. The customer service was great. The people working there are super friendly and sweet. Roasting company hit the spot when I was craving something healthy Southern style food with a lot of vegetables, and I was very glad that the veggies didn't have any meat added to them!",

Not much decor to speak of, but when all meals come out in under 5 minutes and cost less than $10, fancy decorations are unnecessary.   My two favorite meals are the chicken and black bean con queso and the half white meat chicken breast. Both are cooked to perfection, and I can get at least two meals out of one order. The corn bread muffins are also very good (be sure to order additional because you'll want more than one - it's worth it at only $0.35 each), and if you go on Saturday, you can get the mac 'n cheese, which has a kick and is my favorite side item offered. The squash casserole and the sweet potatoes are also quite good.   Ultimately, I recommend the Roasting Company for a quick meal or takeout on those days where you just don't want to cook or need a quick lunch.",

Plus cornbread made from heaven and collard greens for randomness.  When I visited RC, I was suprised by the daring mix of Costa Rican food and Southern food.  The smell of rotisserie chicken makes my heart sing, anyway, but it was even better to eat.  For around $8, I got an entire meal of rotisserie chicken, black beans, and spinach.  I ordered spinach to be healthy (must have been sick or something) and was shocked at how good  it tasted!  Not to mention the chicken...  This place is very homely-located above a rowdy Karaoke bar.  I applaud them for being so deliciously weird.  A salsa bar (as in sauce for tortilla chips, not the music), collard greens, mac n cheese, and tico beans?  The clientele is awesomely mixed as well, young, old, hip and square.

Got teriyaki bbq wings, 1/2 white with smoked cheese and pasta and basil green beans, and 1/2 dark with smoked cheese and pasta and squash casserole. THE WINGS ARE AMAZING; absolutely delicious. I wish that was all I ordered.  My 1/2 white was dry and didn't taste remotely like rotisserie chicken (rotisserie should be perfectly moist all the way through). The smoked cheese and pasta was more like pasta salad than macaroni and cheese (I guess that green stuff in it was spinach), and the basil green beans tasted straight from the can (NO FLAVOR, not even salt and pepper). The 1/2 dark was the same (dry) and my girlfriend liked the squash casserole (has corn in it), but DID NOT like the smoked cheese and pasta. The cornbread has chunks of corn in it, and I'm not talking about fresh corn (the kind that tastes candied and gets stuck in your teeth easily).  I will only be ordering wings from now on. I might be tempted to get the girlfriend their spicy cheese grits if we ever order on Wednesday.",

My daughter always has the jerk pork sandwich...and that does not disappoint either. And the pricing is very reasonable! From what I hear, you can order whole chickens to take home, too; although we haven't done that yet. If you like chicken, you can't go wrong ordering 1/4 or 1/2 with 2 sides. The new potatoes are great, and my daughter likes the cinnamon apples.",

Clearly, I had to check it out.  I did get it to go, so I can't say much on the restaurant itself, other than it's surprisingly roomy inside.    Their chicken pot pies don't mess around.  The thing is massive!   It's chock full of veggies & perfectly moist chicken with a thin golden crust.  My only complaint is there's not as much crust as I would like, but it's still a great pot pie.  Can't wait to go back & check out what else they have to offer!  Also, they have Uncle Scott's Root Beer from Mooresville.  Best Root Beer I've tasted.",

    "text": "I stopped here one lunchtime with a couple of coworkers who recommended the place.  After seeing the outside of the building, I was a little dubious --it felt like there should be a 50 gallon drum outside with a roaring fire and a couple homeless folk keeping warm.  Once we got into the building, that thought didn't go away.  The restaurant itself was a bit, hmm, used, maybe --lets just say it looked though it was in need of some updating.    When you walk in you're presented with a board and a bunch of menu items; right beneath is where you order. --If you've never been before, it might be helpful to checkout their online menu prior to going, otherwise you may be deciding on something in a split second --especially if there is a line behind you.  Soon as you've placed your order, you're shuffled off to the side in True McDonald's style and you wait for your food the be thrown up on a grab-it-yourself servers shelf.  Waiting for the food I had all kinds of interesting thoughts flying through my mind on what it might be made from.  However, that didn't have to last that long --it took ~4 minutes to serve up my hot lunch --a whole minute quicker than the average Chinese joint; that's impressive!  I got the food and I was very pleasantly surprised.  It looked just like a home-cooked meal --not one which had been ordered in a restaurant.  It smelt amazing, looked fantastic, and only took 4 minutes --that's enough to make Stouffers jealous!  Again, to my surprise the food was extremely tasty.  The chicken they use was actually off a full cooked chicken and not from a frozen bag.  There was some salt in the meal  that had been added for taste but not a crap load of MSG flavoring all over the rice to make it taste unnatural --it almost reminded me of when I was a kid and the food was made by mum.  This isn't your typical eat-out kind of restaurant.  If you want a nice home cooked meal without cooking it; this is the place.  It was a nice refreshing change from the typical lunchtime eatery you find.  I will certainly be going here again, I really did enjoyed the food, despite the interesting appearance of the place.",

They only make a certain number for the day but if you get there before 12:30pm, then you should be fine.  It really starts getting crowded after 12pm.  The Pot Pie is large and you really concentrate hard if you want to finish it in one sitting.  There is no shame with taking the rest home and saving it for late night grub.  Still good!!  Also, definitely try the green sauce on the table.  Mmmmmm mmmm.  Although I haven't tried the other food there (BBQ Homestyle), I've only heard the best things.  So give it all a try.  But honestly, 5 stars for the Pot Pie.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

Their rotisserie chicken is at the center of the menu: they do sell other proteins, but you need to try the chicken on your first visit.  Pretty much any form of it is a winner, except on top of a green salad.  The chicken itself is fine, of course, but you can find better veggies elsewhere.  If you can't decide and want to start off with something distinctive, get the chicken on rice with jaco sauce.  It's spicy, tangy, and filling.  The sides here are really good as well.  If you feel like indulging yourself, try the pasta with smoked cheese.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill mac and orange-stuff.  If you want to be healthier, the black beans are the way to go.  Oh, and to make everything even better, there's a salsa bar.    My only caution is that parking can be ... exciting.  It's cramped.  Check over both shoulders before you back out, folks.",

Parking can be a challenge, but it's not the size of their lot, it's the quantity of people heading there for a midday meal.  Their claim to fame is their rotisserie chicken - they serve it in a variety of ways...... in a tortilla with rice and beans, over a salad, smothered in queso, with mayo in a chicken salad, etc.  I haven't had a bad chicken dish yet.  Portions are on the above-avg side.  They also have daily specials......CPP on Wednesdays is a solid choice, but my go-to special is the Meatloaf on Fridays.  Probably my favorite part of their menu is their side dishes.....squash casserole, mashed sweet potatoes, black beans, garlicky new potatoes, etc.  You can just order the veggie plate and walk out extremely satisfied.  Service is fast.....order at the counter, then they call your name to pick it up in a few minutes (sometimes your order is up before you finish paying).

It's not that it's not good, but I just like Boston's chicken a little better because it's seasoned a little better.  But since Roasting Co. is close to work, it is a nice alternative when I plain refuse to go to yet another fast food joint.    The food is fast, consistently decent and relatively cheap.  I normally get the quarter dark, but today I decided to get a half dark (which is only $1.53 more) and now I have leftover for another meal... much more economical :)  Seasoned corn was a little disappointing for it's not seasoned much.  Squash casserole was ok, not super cheesy so I feel like I was being semi-healthy.  Overall the veggies were both little too blend for my taste.    It's a solid place for lunch, especially they have a few outdoor tables so we can also get a dose of Vitamin D on a sunny day.",

It was a great deal! There was plenty of food, the chicken was great, and the hot sauce they have made it even better. We also ordered the tico black beans, herb rice, and collard greens as our sides... We had no complains on any of those either.

A little confusion as to where to go and what to do, without anyone at the front to explain, I figured out to go through the dining area to the back right area to order.  From suggestions from a employee, I ordered the Chicken Black Bean Combo and a 1/2 Chicken with sides of Squash Casserole and Sauteed Veggies!    The combo is chunks of their rotisserie chicken over black beans and rice, then it's topped with a housemade queso sauce.  It's absolutely phenomenally good!  The squash casserole that I had with it was equally impressive!  The 1/2 chicken white, with a side of stir fry veggies, was again a impressive dish that due to the slow roasting of the chicken!  It literally falls off the bone and the stir fry will impressively surprise you!  My only knocks on the place is the lack of knowledge of what to do and where to go when you first go in.  The other is their way of calling out your order once it's ready.  The lady working the pass will literally scream your name out to the point that if you're sitting near that area, it's annoying as hell!  Your constantly bombarded with someone screaming throughout your meal!  The food is incredible, just bring your earbuds!",

Today I had a quarter chicken with dill lima beans and the cinnamon apples.  Those cinnamon apples were something to write home about!  It was served up with a corn bread muffin. Despite the fact they only had dark meat when I ordered, it was still tasty.  I do wonder, however, how a chicken place can run out of white meat. Hmmmm.   It's in a warehouse kind of building and it was jumping with millennials.   I was there representing the baby boomers.   Apparently the other boomers stayed home today.",

The rest of the food was way too bland. I dumped a quarter of a bottle of Tico sauce on it to try to pep it up.  It didn't work :/    I got the Jaco sauce on the side. My husband liked it, I didn't. Probably because I don't like bbq sauce, soy sauce or teriyaki and I believe it's some sort of combo of those.  Overall,  I'd skip this place next time I'm in town but some other Yelpers had better luck.  Tip: Go in under the \"Roasting Co\" sign and go to your right to order.",

The Roasting Company is one of those places that just feels comfortable. The food is great and the vibe is laid back. You'll see a line at lunch time. Don't worry, it moves pretty quickly. They crank out some food here.   I always get a vegetable plate of some sort. The smoked cheese and pasta salad is one of the best sides you'll find in Charlotte. I switch up my other choices based on my current modd. The white beans au gratin, basil green beans, squash- it's all good. I'll stop before I basically just list their entire side item menu. The chicken con queso is delicious. They also have different daily specials. Wednesday is chicken pot pie day. I recommend getting there early because they sometimes run out.   They have a ton of local beers. The Tico sauce- I don't really know what it is, but it's freaking delicious. I put it on everything. There's also a location in Rock Hill and they're opening one in Plaza Midwood. Happy dance.   As if you need any other reason to come here, Luke Kuechly ate here the week before every game last season. The only week he missed- the one regular season game we lost against Atlanta.",

The food is excellent and we feel like we're \"eating healthy\" (if we order the right dishes, of course) even while eating out.  I would classify it as \"southern style\" cuisine with dishes like pulled pork, chicken on the bone, and sides like collard greens (and a ton of others).  The chicken is phenomenal.  Always perfectly cooked. The bar at this place is great!  A little on the small side with only a handful of stools but the beer selection is excellent.  This is a full bar with wine and mixed drinks as well.  The parking can be a bit of a pain but that is True for every business on Montford St.  It's actually better than most places on Montford St. The few times I've used the salsa bar it's been a bit of a mess.  They could do better to keep that station clean and stocked. If you are in the mood for some good chicken, pork, and a bunch of excellent side choices, try this place out.  You won't regret it!",

The teriyaki chicken sandwich was not seasoned at all and did not have any teriyaki on it, even though I asked for extra on the side plus the was a congealed lump of processed velveta- like  cheese mashed onto the chicken. The squash casserole was a paste with no flavor.  The BBQ pork was watery, runny, and not seasoned.  The BBQ sauce was also watery and runny and it seems they dumped a whole bottle of liquid smoke in the vat of BBQ.  The chicken salad was ok but not seasoned.  The Monterrey chicken was watery also and the beans were under done.    Foodie call was great and tried to help us by contacting the company to have the fix the issue.  We did have them send out different items for the items that majorly sucked (pork and Monterrey chicken), but to be honest, we are not really interested in the food or the replacements at this point.  I was starving at the time I told foodie call of the issue and after waiting an hour for the restaurant to remake the items and get them delivered, we already ate something else and now we have two more sandwiches that we don't really want.  They delivered the remakes and they screwed them up too!  They still didn't put teriyaki on the \"marinated teriyaki chicken sandwich\"!  Foodie call was able to get a full refund for this order and I thank them for that.  I will be ordering from them again....just not for the roasting company.    I would be very hesitant about eating at this restaurant until they revert back to their old way of cooking ...whatever they did before September 2013.  Or if you must go, maybe stick with the rotisserie chicken dishes and stay away wraps, sandwiches and pork.",

I usually get the veggie platter which has to be one of the best-priced options in the entire city.  And if you want to have a relaxing bar experience, go there at night time.  The laid back ambiance is awesome!  It is by far the best restaurant on Montford Drive.",

I get the appeal, I understand why this is a favorite of many friends, but it just isn't for me. (Clearly plenty feel they're doing something right if they're continually busy at standard meal times.) Either my sandwich is so loaded with meat and liquid (calling it sauce would mislead you to thinking it has a taste) it disintegrates faster than I can chew, or I feel like I just ate a plate of bland, watered down... what did I order? Luckily, there is a salsa bar and the tico sauce, but I want my pork to be able to contribute SOMETHING to my lettuce and tomato on tortilla.   I will admit, some of the sides are tasty. But with the options in town for rotisserie chicken and even tacos, this does not fall high on my list. Unlimited refills are nice, service is speedy, and the staff at the counter is friendly.",

I ordered the chicken salad on a roll with a side of baked beans, and it was just nothing special. I usually like to go to lunch and be waited on, but we were in a hurry and a colleague suggested The Roasting Company. I have never been here, so I thought, what the heck,I'll try it. I figured it was pretty popular when we walked up to the restaurant and the line was almost out the door. The chicken salad was bland and the only thing I was really able to taste were  the walnuts added to it. The baked beans were too spicy and there was a jalapeno pepper sliced and mixed in with the beans. Overall, not impressed and wouldn't return.",

    "text": "(Note, I've only been here once, but plan on going back...so this is a preliminary review!)  After several co-workers told me to give Roasting Company a try, I went in tonight on my dinner break, and wasn't disappointed!    I had the  dark, with a side of their black beans and squash casserole.  (Though Wednesdays is famous for their Chicken Pot Pie...which I told myself I'd have next time, for sure.) Not only did the food come out quickly, it was pretty cheap, I think about $7 with tax total.    The entree came with a really nice piece of cornbread--moist and warm and slightly sweet.  It was wrapped in foil, I presume to keep the moistness.  Nice idea.  The beans were nicely seasoned, as was the chicken.  The chicken is definitely delicious, with a nice, crispy skin.  Waaaay better than a Boston Market chicken.   But the star?  By far the squash casserole.  I know, connoisseurs of squash casserole will say \"Dion!  This yellow mush doesn't count!  Where is the squash!?\" because it really is more like stuffing, and mushy.  My co-worker, Devon and I were musing over what could be in it...we deducted butter and onions and breadcrumbs.  How can you not love it?  I particularly enjoyed the salsa bar, and the vinegar-y sliced white onions you can pile on your plate.    The only thing that bothered me, was the crazy number of tables that weren't cleared off.  Plates with crusty remnants of food, dried on them.  There must have been 10 tables with dirty plates and half-eaten food on them.  The bathroom also featured clogged up toilets.  Going on the food alone, I give this place 4 stars.  The selection is pretty good--with sides changing every day, and specials, like the pot pie on Wednesdays.    The prices are very reasonable, and the food comes out in about 5 minutes, if even.  A great alternative to fast-food...though they're going to have to work on keeping the place looking clean/nice.    PS:  I like how they mark \"heart healthy\" choices with a star.  Nice touch.",

My husband and I have been eating at the Roasting Company once a week for years. While we have experienced an \"off night \" every now and again, the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff and continued to decline over the past 6 months. While we understand staff turn over, I truly hope the RoCo management will take a hard look at the food coming out of the Montford Dr kitchen. There needs to be some consistency.

The only thing I havent been a fan of is their sides... the \"fresh \" green beans TOTALLY came out of a can and sat in a warmer for a while.

The Brussels were there daily side special, each day they do something off the menu to choose from. These were cooked really well, chopped with a sweet sauce.   The smoked cheese pasta salad was selected at the recommendation of the cashier. It was great. Big penne noodles with a cheese sauce, really filling.   Collards-- how can you go wrong? I did add their signature sauce to this side to take it up a notch. Loved them.  Garlicky Potatoes- another recommendation that I will forever order anytime I visit. Get this side!   I loved the environment, the friendly service and the large menu to choose from. They have a full bar available as well. Great lunch spot!",

It does both well.  As a diner, everything is freshly made, delicious and, as evidenced by my photos, served in generous portions. All chicken options are winners and I love the black bean salad. Even the condiment bar, with sweet vinegary onions, and 3 different salsas including a red hot pico, is special. Unfortunately the corn bread was not. On my last visit it was cold, dry on the inside and soggy on the outside.  Of course, I do realize that's being a little picky, but hey, I love corn bread and was looking forward to it.  As a bar, it is nearly open air and has a real beachy vibe. The first time visitor would be as comfortable as the regular. There's decent draft beer choices and the usual bottled beer selection. Service is friendly and attentive at both.",

Working around the corner, this is working into my lunch rotation.  I ordered a wrap on my first visit which underwhelmed, but mainly because I wanted to eat it as a wrap.  It was so full of food you really need to eat it with a fork/spoon.  The filling was pretty good but the wrap got very soggy quickly.    I have since switched to the chicken and rice or the chicken pot pie.  Both were fantastic.  I suggest getting the sauce on the side of the chicken as it may be a bit overwhelming when it comes out on the chicken.  I also get a side of the black beans...  Wow!  I could eat just them for the meal.    The real prize is their chicken pot pie, the Wednesday lunch special.  It is huge. Strictly for the sake of a thorough review, I ate an entire one.  I was stuffed.  It came out hot and with a great amount of filling.  I love the fact it has crust on top and bottom.  It was not soggy and held up well.  With the size, it could easily feed two.  At the lunch special price it is a steal.  I am very glad I gave RoCo a few more shots.  I have become a convert and will keep coming back.",

The squash casserole was full of flavor too. My husband got the wings and really liked them. They have a salsa bar which is a nice touch.

Okay, if you like mushy dumplings with no flavor this dish is for you. Blah, wouldn't order again. It comes with one side and cornbread. Cornbread was hard as a rock and cold, ugh! However I will say the mixed veggies were pretty good. But, honestly, how badly can you mess up stir frying veggies?

Naturally, we opted for the special and it was definitely delicious.  It is piping hot, so use caution when eating.  Nice large chunks of chicken breast, peas, carrots, and potatoes are baked into a medium sized aluminum take out container with a crispy crust topping everything. Super delicious, especially, with their habanero hot sauce.  Will return to try their roast chicken next time!",

Not a fan of that but I can combine the ingredients myself so oookkkk. But the chicken on top was bland & my family agreed. The place has a cool no-frills vibe but I'd rather have good food than atmosphere and was disappointed. Not going back. Don't recommend.",

The rating was at a 90.0... that sucks... need to work on that. Then I stood there waiting to place my order while the staff chatted it up behind the counter. It wasn't until one employee came out from behind & called to her coworker - several times- before she stopped talking to take my order. It was after 2pm so they were not busy. I placed my order to go & then proceeded to wait on my to-go order. After 10 minutes I got my food & I was on my way. Got home - order was wrong. This is not the first time this has happened with our to-go orders from the Roasting Company, but it will be the last for me. I'm officially DONE with the Roasting Company after 30 years.",

    "text": "As Bill O'Reilly would say, \"F it, We'll do it live!\" I'm writing this one while still here waiting on my Baked Apples to cool down.  Restaurant decor is very impressive (although the booths need to be reupholstered) and probably the most standout storefront on Montford. Walk in and the bar is the centerpiece, with a highlight on local brews. Smoke is in the air from the roasters as soon as you walk in and that's a good sign!  First time here so I tried the Thursday special: Chicken & Dumplings, along with Smoked Cheese & Pasta Salad, and Baked Cinnamon Apples.  Took a seat and my food was quick to arrive. Chicken & Dumplings were good. Nice flavor on the thickened broth but it was overpowered by a mountain of coarse black pepper. I don't say that lightly because I tend to go heavy on black pepper myself, but this was very overseasoned. I couldn't pick out the more subtle flavors in the dish due to the pepper. Dumplings were nice and fluffy, I'm used to a bit more al dente for dumplings but these were fine all the same.  Smoked cheese & pasta salad, best thing I had. The pasta was perfect, dressing was light and bright, seasoned with dill and cucumber. I could eat this everyday. The only thing I didn't pick up much of was smoked cheese, or much of any cheese, but I would take it the same way again and again.  Baked apples... Would have been better as applesauce. The apples were dissolving by just trying to pick them up with my spoon. Unfortunately cooking them to this point, this dish has also lost a lot of its subtle notes like the dumplings. I just got tart and over sweet. Bit of a disappointment.  Regardless of the apples, with good chicken and great pasta salad I'm looking forward to my next visit. I'll probably try the Cornbread dressing as the little round of Cornbread I got was killer! Lots of potential I see here, I just gotta find the right things on the menu.",

I always love taking people who have never been there bc they are always so pleased with how awesome the food is!  Just a few of my favorite things! Smoked Cheese and Pasta (pasta salad) - It's my absolute favorite!!! I cant come here and not order that. It's tangy, creamy, and just awesome.  The Wings - Order them traditional and get them with extra sauce... who doesnt like extra sauce? For dunking, pouring, taking shots...whatever...it's delicious.  Chicken and Queso over Rice - AMAZING. And get jalapenos added to the top.   Tico Sauce - this stuff is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! Vinegary, Tangy, a little Spicy... and perfect for everything they have. Put it on your chicken with queso.. put it on your salad. Ordered tacos? Put it on that too. Also, if you crave it all the time like i do, just buy a bottle and take it home!!! Yummmmmm  The summary of this review would be - JUST GO EAT THERE NOW. :) You wont be sorry. And they totally have a bar now - so drink up!",

The staff shuffles an enormous amount of clientele through the place at lunch (dinner is substantially slower) but is helpful when needed and remembers the regulars.    It's possibly my favorite lunchtime destination EVER.  I am currently a vegetarian but I've been eating here since my carnivore years.  (The chicken and black bean combo was excellent!)  My go-to order is the vegetarian combo, a mixture of rice, black beans, Jaco sauce (can only be explained as a cross between barbecue sauce and soy sauce...but that doesn't really work because, trust me, I've tried to recreate it at home!), cheese and chopped onions.  I always get the smoked gouda pasta salad...although there is no way that could be consTrued as good for me.  It's Nirvana on a plate!  All of the vegetables are delicious...daily specials disappear quickly!",

They give you real plates and silverware, but yet it still feels casual and fun.  The prices were fair.  However, I was not blown away.  I got the 1/2 chicken with sweet potato fries,  The chicken had good flavor, but was a little tough and I could see this being replicated at most any casual dining place.  The fries were average and lacked that \"something\" that makes sweet potato fries different than regular fries.  The best thing on the plate was the cornbread - a real star here.    One thing I really liked was the high backed booths, which made you feel like you were the only people in the restaurant, even when full.  Even with this, though, the acoustics were of such where it was hard to have a conversation, and the music was a bit loud.    I really want to come back and try some of their more \"tex mex\" type dishes.  My friend works near this place, so I feel this is a reason why he has grown to appreciate it more.  It is good, but not worth going out of the way for.",

Perhaps it's all coincidence or the new manager has something to do with it. But by the looks of it they have taken a hit in business, go figure since the atmosphere has completely changed. This place also seems less friendly to Montford, they now only do food until 1:30, and close at 12 Sun-Wed. They only offer  a limited menu after 10, and they no longer provide table service. Drink specials seem to have stayed the same but for all you beer lovers, the draft lineup is never switched up anymore, huge downfall. My husband and I were maybe not frequent enough to call regulars but were in there at least 3 times per month (enough as to where Jake and Danielle knew us by name). It was a little treat to go to The Roasting Co., get a drink and dinner, get recommendations on places in Charlote with good food. Now we like to go to Moosehead down the street. Also, they are lucky ALE hasn't hit them yet considering the new manager drinks at the bar out in the open during work (very unprofessional). We'll be getting all togo from here on out.",

Seriously if you get a veggie plate you will feel like you've been transported to a southern Sunday church social!! I feel like they have the little old southern ladies cooking in the back!! Anyways their chicken is good, occasionally dry but I don't mind my chicken that way really. Their chicken pot pies are good and absolutely huge for the money. However the crust is a crisco crust I believe and that's not my favorite. I also recently tried the Jaco pork and it was amazing. My favorite things though are the veggies (haven't I said that already lol). If I get the quarter chicken or the veggie plate I kind of feel like it's Thanksgiving because there is squash casserole, sweet potato mash, green beans, mac and cheese if it's Saturday etc. If you order it through foodie call it's the one and only restaurant that your food will arrive 100% still piping hot!!   If I'm craving comfort food and I don't want to cook this is my go to restaurant!",

They were GRAY! Also, they ran out of their special. It was 2 p.m. How could you possibly run out of the special at 2 pm?? I don't recommend this place and I will never go back. It was gross.",

    "text": "I've been loving the Roasting Company since I would tag along with my parents and eat there as a kid. Carribean music and vibe, good beer specials, and really delicious chicken.   I always go for the 1/4th white meal, but I've had the dark and it's delicious also. The chicken and rice con queso, monterey chicken wrap and chicken and black bean combo are also awesome choices. Go for the tico black beans, garlicky new potatoes, collard greens or cinnamon apples for sides - the stir fry veggies and white bean au gratin are a little bland compared to the rest of the selections. If you happen to come in when the mac and cheese or stewed okra and tomatoes are on special, definitely try those out as well.  The cashiers at the counter are always friendly and I've never left this place hungry. Perfect.",

Their basic plates of rice, beans, chicken or pork, and two sides is a really great deal for the price.  I ate here a year ago and don't remember being impressed, but decided to try it again and this time it really hit the spot.  The black beans and white bean au gratin were perfectly seasoned and yummy.  The green beans were too watery  but still not bad.  The Pork with Jaco sauce was delish.  I will be eating here much more often.",

I wasn't even sure this place was open when I drove by it the first 1000 times but we finally decided to go in and give it a shot while getting the oil changed down the street.  Well worth it!  I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and it was a MOUND of chicken with thier special jaco sauce on a bun with lettuce and tomato.  Definitely plenty...I couldn't eat it all.  The jaco sauce...which I was told contained soy, pineapple juice, honey, and worchestire sauce....tasted more like watered down soy all by itself.  It was so salty!  For my side, I had cheese grits and they were creamy, delicious, and a little spicy thanks to what I think were some green chiles.  All in all, good stuff, but next time, I will get the sauce on the side.  Oh!  For vegetarians, this is a dream....they have at least 10 veggies on their side menu, plus specials of the day.  Veggie plates all around!",

Collards and mac & cheese did not disappoint.  They have changed the place a good bit since I was last here, adding a bar.  The bar was beautiful and a place I wouldn't mind hanging out with friends.  A lot of people passed us with wings, maybe something we'll try next.

My husband enjoyed the garlic roasted potatoes. I sampled his and will say that they are VERY VERY garlicky. He had the chicken and rice and liked it well enough. I had the quarter white meat. I guess with all the fantastic reviews, my expectations were a little too high. I didn't feel like it had any different flavor than a Costco rotisserie chicken that I can buy for $4.99.

And there is even a private parking lot for this place - imagine that!    The food is mainly chicken, and I usually go for the quarter white meal which comes with two of their great sides. Try the cinnamon apples as one of them - you won't be disappointed. And it's like having dessert. I also recently tried their chicken salad sandwich and thought the chicken salad itself was done really really well. Oh and Wednesday's are chicken pot pie days - rather large ones too.  Inside the place has been remodeled and expanded. They now have a large bar which makes for a great evening scene and will keep them in business even longer. I prefer to sit in one of the tall booths. They make you feel like you and your compadres are dining in a private room. There are also some swanky high top tables as well.  So if you are a carnivore, go check out this great chicken restaurant!",

I was especially excited to try the Costa Rican inspired food after visiting the country earlier this year and completely falling in love with the food and culture. Unfortunately I didn't care for the food at all. I wouldn't say it was necessarily bad but just didn't suit my taste. I had the chicken and black bean plate with sauteed vegetables. I found everything overly salty and didn't like the sauce at all. I'm not a picky eater and like most foods (except turnip greens, I just can't sorry) but I didn't enjoy this meal. My husband ordered a wrap with chicken, black beans and queso that he said was just \"okay.\" It was chicken pot pie day when we were that and that did look good and like a popular choice. We probably won't be back but it's a place everyone might need to try for themselves. Fortunately the prices are reasonable enough to do just that.",

I get the Chicken Queso on Rice. Unbelievably good! Shredded chicken over rice covered in queso. The Mac & Cheese is spicy and different - the baked beans also have a kick. The cornbread actually has corn in the bread and sweet tea rounds off the southern experience.  If you drive too quickly down Montford you'll miss this gem... So slow down and enjoy!",

On several occasions my boyfriend and I have gone late at night when we're finally ready to eat or have had late work meetings and can't grab dinner until 1030. With that being said, every time I have been in it is super chill with a small (and mostly quiet) group of people inside. There are plenty of beer options, we always sit at the bar since it's always late, and have never had any problems with service. The portions are huge for what you pay, you won't leave hungry. The food is good, you're not going for five star here, but it is always cooked properly and hits the mark for its cuisine category. I do love the cornbread, it actually has pieces of corn in it, and I normally am not a fan of cornbread. My partner and I at work even grabbed dinner at 1AM the other day, being we work on an ambulance, they were extremely quick to prepare our food--We were very grateful!!

You can't go wrong with that choice.  It is heaven in a LARGE cup!  Prices have gone up but still well worth the value.  Their chicken is ALWAYS fresh and there are so many different variations.  They now have a bar area if you have a moment to grab some however I never have since I have been on business on every trip.  This is mostly a self service including drinks.

Also, this place offers service with a smile and a large variety of sides! Huge meal, veggie plate or sandwich/wrap combo. No fries, but you won't miss them.    The only thing if any, that I'd change would be, a dessert or two, but even then, they offer a few daily, until gone. All good. You will get your money's worth and a full tummy!",

    "text": "The Roasting Company was our go-to spot when we lived in the neighborhood. It was quick and always delicious. We would often dine in and even more often grab it to go.  Our favorite dishes are the pork over rice and the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides. The sauces are unique and so good! I always get the squash casserole as a side and alternate between the others. I've never been disappointed but some other favorites are the garlic roast potatoes, the pasta salad, the mac n cheese, the baked beans....you get the idea.   I love that I can eat healthy here. Just get some roast chicken and a couple of veggie sides.   We will miss having this place nearby but we'll be back.",

Don't forget the sides, they're all to die for.    Favorites:  Chicken Pot Pie, Cheesy Grits, Cornbread and Chili Tacos.  So much space, good for big parties, and if the line looks long, it goes quick.  LASTLY - get all the wings, taste them all.  They take longer, but only because they are delish.",

The sides are amazing, never have I seen so  many great choices...from Squash Casserole to Pasta with Provelone to Seasoned Corn. the Selection goes on and on and also adds different ones during the week. I wanted to try just the Chicken and 2 sides. It was great..not a tiny chicken like you get at some places but a nice sized breast and wing, thigh and leg combo. Very Juicy and warm.  Their Barbecue sauce is delicious..a step away from the norm - I think it must have coffee in it...Wonderful!.  A couple of salsas top off the additions to make your roast chicken more tasty!  I will be coming back...I would even do the 4 sides and cornbread next time..I wanted to taste all the veggie!!!",

The first thing I'll say is that the parking is easy and that is always a plus when you are going somewhere you've never been. The restaurant is one in which you  pay and order at the register and then you wait and they call your name and you take your food to a table. Most of us order the 1/4 chicken, which came with corn bread and a side. This was the perfect size meal for lunch and is priced appropriately. Our orders came out quickly and we took a great table by the windows. The food was delicious. The staff is very pleasant and hard working. I will certainly return.",

I came her on a lazy Friday night after work...it was one of those nights where I didn't really want to go out to dinner, but I didn't really want to stay home...when I first walked in it took me a sec to figure out their set up, and how it works, so I just followed the crowd... (Btw, Don't let the exterior look of this place scare you away-it can look a bit \"outdated/older\")  Once inside, You walk up to a counter, place your order/pay and then wait off to side until they call your name. You can place your order to go, or you can look for a an open table.  I saw that there was two open seats at the bar so I told the young lady that I would be by the bar. I was waiting to here my name be called...but she brought the food on over to me, which was extremely nice of her since she didn't have to do that.   One of the reasons I decided to actually stay and eat there was that all there draft beer is $3.50 on Fridays. You CANT beat that. They have an AWESOME selection of beers...I just had to stay lol...  We ordered: Chicken and black bean combo con queso - rice topped with chicken, black beans and queso. It was delicious! The chicken was pulled right off of the bird, it was hot, tender. juicy....really really good.  1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner with sidesd. Again, the chicken was just PERFECT!  For sides we had white beans au gratin 3/5, squash casserole 5/5, smoked cheese and past salad 5/5, and the collard collard greens 4/5.  This place just reminds me of home. If you want a homestyle cooked meal, without making it yourself, this is the PERFECT place to come to.   I will definitely be coming back here again. I really enjoyed the food and had really great service.",

I mean, it's good but it could use some more flavors as far as seasoning the chicken. Seriously. I had the chicken salad sandwich and it was super bland in my mouth. Couldn't finish it. I also had mac and cheese which was okay but I was confused why they labeled it spicy when there was not a twinge of spicy lol. I tasted my friend's veggies, and they just weren't very flavorful. I guess if you are on a low sodium diet, or you just like plain food you should go here. I mean, I wanted to like it, but I couldn't get past the lack of seasoning. If you all are gonna do an arroz con pollo you need to add some flavor. (tasted that too). I need yall to spice up your life @theroastingcompany lol",

I had a side of mac and cheese, which was on par with any other mac and cheese out there. The highlight of my meal was the collard greens - well seasoned and tender.   My group and I had a hard time finding a clean table. The restrooms were also a little dingy. I realize this is not an upscale establishment, but the place felt a bit grimy.

The sante fe chili and rice was homemade beef chili served over rice and topped with our queso sauce. Man this stuff was stick to your ribs goodness.

    "text": "I will preface the next few reviews by saying that North Carolina has some of the best food I've ever had. I've been to the state four times over the past six years, and every time I come, I am blown away by the food.  Roasting Company is yet another place that serves great food for great prices. The chicken is tender, the sides are delicious, the atmosphere is cool, and the prices are very good. I got the soft tacos, spicy mac 'n cheese, and chili. The tacos are made with the rotisserie chicken, though they didn't use the most tender and juicy meat that I love. However, the lettuce and cheese were very fresh, as was the tortilla, and the sauce selection is pretty good. The spicy mac 'n cheese was a special vegetable of the day (I love any state that calls mac 'n cheese a vegetable) so it might not be available every day, but it was damn good; creamy, tasty mac 'n cheese with a real kick. The chili was fantastic; homemade from an old recipe, just the right amount of everything, and a good helping of shredded cheddar and sour cream on top. All that for about $8. If you're ever in Charlotte, definitely check this place out.",

You can get tacos, some sandwiches and a dish called jaco pork (with rice).  There are side dishes, wraps and salads as well.  Prices are reasonable ~$8 for a plate and $6.50 or so for a sandwich.  The food is tasty, prepared to order (mostly) and arrives in minutes.  I have been for lunch and dinner and enjoyed every meal!",

From the delicious, fall-off-the-bone chicken, to the random chicken + something delicious + something else delicious combos, you can't go wrong with anything at The Roasting Company. The sides are all great, especially the spicy mac and cheese on Saturdays and the corn muffins that come with are scrumptious and have corn and green chilies in them. And while the food is always great, the service is always spectacular as well! Everyone who works there must be constantly eating the food because they are ALL so happy! Their to-go option is great too. Call it in and scoot directly to the front of the line to pick it up. And, while this might sound trivial, the food is packaged up well so you don't have any crazy spills on the way home.",

I had heard about it for years and my mom was always getting it for me when I was sick but I had never actually been inside.  She said the way they seasoned their chicken was perfect for getting over the common cold.  Well she was right, it always did the trick.  So I was thrilled when on a rather healthy-feeling day I went in for a delicious meal of fresh veggies and homemade cake!  The chicken, as always, hit the spot.  There was a cool, funky vibe in there thanks to the young and welcoming staff.  And it was nice to just order at the counter and then kick back in the casual environment and catch up with old friends.",

The one constant is that I'll schlep from anywhere in the city to Montford for the Roasting Company.  For me, it's the Tico sauce, not so much the Jaco sauce. I have to have some Tico black beans with extra Tico at least once a week. I just keep forgetting to go on Fridays when they have stewed okra and tomatoes. Darnit!  And I agree with the other poster who mentioned just how many restaurants have come and gone on Montford over the years. The Roasting Company still remains.",
