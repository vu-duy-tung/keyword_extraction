Horrible customer service, very rude individual who was suppose to be working the phone. I tried to place an order to go as I was in a hurry, and the phones weren't working. When I went in they were very rude and claimed the phone had not rung. No there is a problem with your phone it's giving me a dial tone signal. They were super rude and unprofessional. I will only be going back to the Sabor on Hawthorne, so I recommend Sabor but absolutely not this location.",

I usually do not mind waiting for an order to go when I place it in person, though I am extremely upset when people who order food after me (multiple people at that) get their food before I get mine. Waiting 21 minutes for 3 tacos to go while a table of 3 people who ordered food after me got it in less than 10. AWFUL. Food clearly rushed and thrown together in a to go box. Upset. At this point I just wish I would have canceled the order and got my money back. Very disappointing.",

The counter server was not friendly and it took a really long time to receive our food. Several people that ordered after us received their food before us. I had to inquire about our order and only after that did we receive it. When it arrived neither of the two kids quesadillas we ordered were cooked through. The cheese was completely unmelted. The menu items that my husband and I ordered were also just okay. Usually Sabor is delicious and super quick. The Coronas were fantastic though! Maybe it was just an off-day for the kitchen staff...",

    "text": "Unfortunately I need to edit and downgrade my review of this newest Sabor location in South Park. The first week they were pretty good and mostly on the ball. Since then, it's been a steady decline in almost every area - service mostly. For a walk-up-and-order place, the service is PAINFULLY slow. No matter what time of day, the wait for both ordering and food prep is just too long for this type venue. I've tried this place 5 times, and the last 4 experiences were frustrating and disappointing. Last Tuesday, I stopped in at 1:40 on my lunch break, I ordered ONE fish taco and waited 15 mins. The evenings that I've gone, the average wait in line to just place your order has been 15 mins. Then another 15-20 mins for the order to be ready. Sorry but that's unacceptable for almost anywhere. There are two registers for ordering, yet there's been just one order taker each time I've been there. Biggest blunder of all...they've got the counter person wo takes orders ALSO answering phones and processing call-in orders...while the line of people waiting to order goes out the door. The manager and staff seem unfriendly and glum.  I kept trying this place ONLY because my experiences at the Elizabeth location on Hawthorne have been fantastic. I was SO looking forward to having a Sabor closer to me....but sorry Sabor South Park, I'll stick with the Hawthorne location.",

I have now been to this location 3 times and every single time it has taken far longer than necessary to get food to the table. Tonight, they were at roughly half capacity and I waited 10 minutes for a taco salad. The last time I was there, they completely forgot my friend's order. She finally got it about 20 minutes later. It seems like they have enough staff but maybe aren't using them efficiently. Just my two cents. I'll be back because Sabor is awesome, but I'd like to see this location step their service game up.",

My husband an I went in here for the first time on a Friday night around 8pm-ish, and there was no line. We took a look at the menu for about 3 minutes and decided what we wanted.  We stepped up to the checkout counter and waited.  I didn't mind waiting a bit, but we waited for over 10 minutes, with numerous employees looking at us and then going about their tasks.  No acknowledgement from anyone who worked there that we were standing there at all.  No \"We'll just be a minute, we're super busy\", nothing.  Finally someone came over to take our order, we ordered our food for carryout and waited.  We got our food, and went home.  When we got home, we realized that they forgot to include my husband's tacos!  The food was good, but I will never come back to this location.  I've been to the Pineville location several times since this visit took place and the service and attention to detail at that location is FAR superior.",

While I stood in line I saw less than desirable sanitary habits. They do not have a sanitary number posted on the wall and I would be curious to see what it is. Sabor is one of my favorite restaurants in the Charlotte area, but the other locations produce much better food. One last annoyance, but has nothing to do with the food, is the sassiness. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate it an 8.5.",

    "text": "I was surprised to hear a South Park location was added probably cause I have a hard time associating a \"street grill\" with the South Park area and demographic, but whatevs...  good food is for everyone!    The new location is a little more \"finished\" than the Elizabeth or NoDa locations... maybe it needs a couple of months to get a \"lived in\" feel... or maybe they are trying to appeal to the South Park crowd.  Either way... I believe this is the largest of the 3 locations (tablewise) AND they have a parking lot unlike the other two locations.  Although the parking lot was completely full when I got there... its nice to know there are more spaces instead of trying to figure out where you are going to park.  It was Tuesday, so naturally there was a crowd that came in waves.  My group of five had to wait on a table, but ended up getting the bar seats that look out to the parking lot.  It usually works out, and it is good that you have to \"fight\" for a table.... but sometimes you don't want that hassle.  Had some standard beef tacos - felt like you got more protein here, but the flavor was different (just a bit).  Still a good taco... and beggars can't be choosers when you are paying $1 for a taco, but I would expect the same delicious food regardless of what day it was.  Probably give the location a couple more months to \"settle in\" but for now, I may stick with the Elizabeth location and fighting the UPS trucks for parking.",

I got fairly plain tacos, so I want to try again and get something more substantial so I can better ranknbetween that and my other favorite taco places.   I shared some queso dip with a friend and it was so yummy! She ordered a burrito and it was HUGE.   The have a salsa bar by the drinks so you can get what you like.",

One of my favorite parts is all the salsa flavors available at no extra cost-- you just have to ask the workers for extra plastic cups if you need more and they'll gladly give you them!",

    "text": "My husband and I come to Sabor almost every Tuesday for taco night, however the was the first time at the SouthPark location. It's new, clean and not as busy as the other locations. They still have the salsa bar, and the pineapple salsa is bomb! Try dipping it into your queso in it too - game changer!  As for the tacos go, they don't seem to skimp on the fillings here. Maybe because it's not as busy so they don't need to crank a million tacos out a minute, but at this Sabor location, the tacos were more full - and flavorful!   If it's your first time here for taco Tuesday, all authentic tacos (onion + cilantro) are only $1- this includes chicken, beef, veggie and black bean. My favorite is the chicken  - add a little jalapeno pineapple salsa to it and you got a good taco on your hands. The beef is also dynamite with the \"orange sauce\", which they have on the salsa bar in a squeeze container. It's a must with the beef taco!  I'll probably stick with my nearby location in Elizabeth, but if you haven't been to Sabor for a Tuesday in SouthPark you need to change that pronto!",

    "text": "If you ignore the over 30 minute wait for our food, it was a nice meal! Glad to see Tina had a better experience early on.  I was surprised with the excessive wait for an early dinner on Sunday, even with it being opening weekend, as this is the fifth location and I figured they would hit the ground running. Had they shared that we could expect such a long wait when we ordered, I probably would not have been as frustrated. Not to worry, I'm sure they will be up to speed soon enough and visitors will be able to expect the same great food at seriously good prices AND have it ready quick as a fiddle.  This location has the expected SouthPark polish and full Sabor flavor. The arepas are really quite filling and the elote loco corn really is a must-have for any first-timer, as was the case for my relatives visiting town. The setup is similar to the original Elizabeth location, so locals will feel right at home.   I'm a big fan of Sabor, just consider giving this location some time before you rush over to enjoy a busy time like Taco Tuesday or any of their other fantastic specials. If you spend a lot of time in SouthPark, add this place to your regular rotation for lunch or dinner.",

My initial takeaway is the Sabor we all know and love has gotten a new face lift to fit into South Park. At the end of the day, the price is still right and I was surprised by how friendly and helpful the staff was.  For those who haven't been to a Sabor before, it is a latin street food concept that specializes in both tacos and burritos. Taco Tuesday is the go-to for most people as they have $1 tacos, but I prefer to avoid the madness.  With that out of the way, I ended up not ordering in advance (highly recommended if you are looking to grab and go) and sat down to hang out for a bit while they prepped my food. Overall I found the experience to be very positive as they asked me if they could get me salsa, a water, and brought me my food once it was done. I do think they were going a bit over the top since they had just opened and it was a busy time with Christmas right around the corner, but it was to my benefit so I'm not complaining! I'll certainly be swinging by again to get my burrito fix!",

I only frequent the Southpark location, so I have no other locations to compare it to - just my previous visits.   I always get the Autenticos tacos with chicken and a side of chips. Usually, the tacos are great and the chicken is fresh and seasoned. However, this time it was greasy and not as flavorful: there was grease dripping out of my taco the entire time I ate it (not to mention that my tortilla broke while I was eating it). Also, I usually love the chips, but they tasted almost stale this time (also greasy). And to top it off, 4/6 of the salsa bar containers were empty when I went up (and stayed empty throughout my ~40 minute visit).   However, all this being said, the Sabor staff is still super friendly and the ambiance is nice. Also, that queso is so good, I'll give em that. Despite this, though, I think I'm going to take a break from Sabor for now- at least this location.",

However, tonight at this location, I ordered a plate of nachos to-go. When I approached the counter to ask for salsa containers I was met with sass as if it was unheard of to want salsa with my nachos? But nonetheless, one of my favorite parts of Sabor is the salsa bar to spice up all of their dishes! So I was a little disappointed to be met with that sass.   Upon getting home, my nachos had absolutely NO queso on them and I ended up having to add my own shredded cheese as I didn't particularly want to go back to the restaurant at this point. What's the point of nachos without cheese..?? Additionally the beef Barbacoa was overly seasoned and salty (doesn't help that the chips are seasoned too, which I love) to the point that I ended up not finishing. Overall a pretty disappointing experience when I just wanted a plate of chips and queso :(",

They give you a table number and bring your food to you rather than call your name from the counter. There's more seating and a bar along the wall where you can sit. Of course they have the salsa bar and the soda machine. Right now they have $1 tacos from 3-5 every day and all day Tuesday. I'm sure that's a promo for their new opening as the other location only does $1 tacos on Tuesday.  The staff is so nice here and there's a guy who has the aura of a manager is very nice too. They also give you more chips than you can possibly eat. I want to try the arepas here because they look so good.

My favorites include the tacos, queso and amazing salsa bar!   But I've come to the conclusion that my new favorite day here is Thursday. Why? Because the special of the day is an empanada and an arepa. And both are delicious! I get them with chicken or beef. I mix it up because options both are delicious.   I'd absolutely recommend this place. Plus you can't go wiring with free chips-with your check in.   Enjoy!",

This was my first time at this location and my first time at a Sabor for a taco Tuesday (crazy, I know). Their basic tacos are only $1 on Tuesdays which is awesome.  We tacos for the first time this time: grind beef, shredded chicken, veggie, and steak ($1 extra). They were all pretty good, but the steak was my favorite.   The burritos are my favorite thing to get. The carne asada fries and empanadas are also quite good. I love finishing the meal with grilled plantains.   If you haven't been to Sabor, it's definitely a must try for casual food in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Every review I write about a Sabor is basically just a love letter.   I am obsessed with their queso and the salsa bar. The pineapple habanero salsa is IMO the best condiment you'll find in Charlotte. Pro tip: if you check in on your Yelp app, you'll get free chips. Make sure to check in before you walk in the door because this location has really bad cell phone service.   Tuesdays are the day to come, $1 taco autenticos. It will be super busy, so be prepared. I also love Mondays, $6 for the Three Amigos burrito and a drink. Parents- kids eat free on Wednesdays. Fridays, margaritas are $5. There's seriously a special every single day.   Personally, their ground beef is my favorite protein, so I'll get that in whatever vehicle I'm feeling that day (tacos, burritos, quesadilla, nachos, empanada). On taco Tuesdays, I always get a shredded chicken and two ground beef tacos. I love their street corn. I think the nachos are one of the best deals in the city. The portion is HUGE, so it's great to share with a big group. Recently, Tonya P has me ordering their Paloma.   Really cool thing about Sabor is that their menu is super customizable. I like to get plantains with ground beef and queso. I know that may sound like an odd combination, but it's delicious. You can also do things like get the carne asada fries, but sub yucca fries for the french fries.  If you're in a rush, hop on your computer and place your order online. You can skip the line and pick up.  Sabor, I love you. I'm just waiting for the day you decide to open a location in my driveway. Or, at least just put a salsa bar there.",

And don't pay for salsa- they have a free salsa bar in the back that includes a tasty spicy mayo dip.    Their burritos are tasty, large and filling. It seems super popular for Taco Tuesday - $1 tacos! I stopped by to pick up a to-go order (order online!) and the place was packed!   And ask about their secret menu",

Like other locations, Sabor brings in a crowd. Due to the fact the register is close to the door the line can always be long and a little misleading as it does move quickly. Unfortunately due to the amount of customers, definitely a lot of families, tables can be tough to find, but hang in there.  The food is okay, in my mind nothing spectacular. Yes, they have a good menu and a great salsa bar.  Most recently I got the Quesadillas and I really enjoyed those. The Sabor Margarita is also great, but the last two times I got the wrong one by accident. And, you can definitely tell the difference between the Regular and the Sabor. Needless to say it is a great addition to this shopping center and I know I'll be back!",

Basically a staple in the Charlotte scene these days, you're never too far from one. This one is the closest to home for me now and never nearly as slam-packed as the main location usually is.  You can get tacos, arepas, bowls and more. Or just load up on nachos and one of their plentiful salsa choices. Ordering is usually a breeze - although a sort of resounding similarity at all locations seems to be that staff doesn't care much for working here or dealing with your additional requests...not sure what the deal is with that. Prices aren't bad, especially when you consider the volume and quality of the food they offer. Trying to get your Texmex fix, I highly recommend Sabor instead of any other chain joint (see Moe's, Salsarita's, Qdoba even Chipotle).",

Finally my husband and I stopped in and I get it now. It's casual like Chipotle, but has great cocktails too. It definitely gets busy on weekends and Friday nights but it's worth it. We got a gordita with chicken, arepa, steak taco, chips and guac, and 2 margs. It was definitely too much food but we couldn't narrow it down so we went with it.   Everything was so flavorful and tasty. I loved the arepa shell, it was very comfort food-eqsue and the chicken was nicely shredded and tender. The gordita was huge and I enjoyed all the fillings compared to the arepa. The guac was fresh and delicious, and was a great portion, and the chips were hot and fresh. The margaritas were also refreshing and didn't taste like crappy sour mix (which they do at so many restaurants), they were great and only $5 that night. The only thing we didn't totally love was the steak taco. The meat was tough and dry. But other than that, we really enjoyed Sabor and will definitely come back when the arepa and guac cravings hit.",

It's clean, updated, roomy, and well-lit.   I'm going to have to go back for something else, because my nachos were just okay. There was very little queso which I discovered when I was almost done with my meal, hiding under four of my chips. Also, there wasn't a lot of meat. It was really just a big pile of chips and lettuce with a splash of ground beef, refried beans and queso. The flavors were good, but it was barely noticeable given the lack of main ingredients, like cheese.   But there I go, getting my go to nacho dish. So I'll take the 'L' for this one. This is clearly the type of place where I need to get some tacos or maybe a burrito.   Considering this joint is literally in walking distance to my house, I'll swing by again.

We forgot to get a receipt while we were there for reimbursement through the job. I called weeks later and spoke with the the manager who was happy to assist with looking up our order and texting the receipt to me. I worked in restaurants for years and know that kind of call can be a bit annoying. I really appreciate the excellent, professional service.
