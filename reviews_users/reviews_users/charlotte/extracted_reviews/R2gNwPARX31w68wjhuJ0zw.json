You've either had Hickory Tavern in other towns, and you're going for 'quality control' or you think this sounds unique (it's like an NC TGI Friday's).  It's not.  There are better options....  (Like a frozen dinner at Trader Joe's right across the street)",

    "text": "Hickory Tavern is a Charlotte-area sports bar staple.  This particular location at the Met is the one where I have most often gone to eat, drink and be merry.  It's nicer than some of the divey sports bars you'll find, but still reasonably priced.  If you're familiar with the Met, you know that parking is awesome (note the sarcasm).  There's a deck across the way and you may want to give yourself a few minutes to wind through the rows to find a spot.  Once parked, things will improve as it's just a quick jaunt across the street.  One of the things I like about Hickory Tavern is that I always know what to expect.  They have a pretty good menu with enough different options to satisfy most folks.  I usually go with the burger, the wings (Korean BBQ), or the chicken tacos.  They also have an extensive draft and bottle list with local options, regional, and beyond.  Service can be hit or miss but more often than not it's pretty good.  We generally don't have to wait for a table which is another plus.    You'll find TVs everywhere in this place.  In fact, I doubt that there is a seat in the house that doesn't have a clear line of sight to a TV screen.  If you want to watch a game (or many games at the same time), this is a great spot for that.  All in all, a good sports bar with reasonable prices, quality beer selection, and some solid eats.",

    "text": "We went here with some friends to watch the Panthers play this past weekend and we were pleasantly and unpleasantly surprised alike...    First off, if you're going here to watch a game on Sunday, it's pretty cool... They label the televisions to show which games will be on each particular television, which has to work out great... They're not changing the channels, though, so if you want to see a particular game in front of you, I suggest you get there early...  We sat outside and they have these awesome wicker \"couches\" with good cushions... I use quotes because they're actually individual pieces, but that's not a problem and it comes in handy (see next section)... I was worried the table wouldn't be high enough to eat from, but it turns out, it wasn't too bad... We had 5 screens in front of us and there was a nice bit of cover, so the beginning of the game was awesome...   As I'm sure you've noticed, we've had some hardcore heat coming through the area even though it's pretty late in the year, so once the sun came over that cover, it was brutal!  That's when it came in handy that we could pick up the \"couch\" and move it forward a couple feet... lol There's nothing they can do about that, though, so it's not a problem, really... Just a heads up for if you're sun-sensitive like me... Go ahead and grab a table indoors...  The other thing was it took quite a while for the food to come out and I get that they were slammed, so it is what it is... We had a constant stream of people coming to apologize, though and that was definitely appreciated...   The food was okay, but not spectacular... The boyfriend had a sandwich they had on special with buffalo chicken and three different cheeses... He said the cream cheese in it was a little overwhelming, but other than that, it was decent... In my opinion, it looked a bit like pimento cheese, so I can see how that would have happened... lol  I ordered the tavern salad and it wasn't bad, but you know how you can just taste something a little weird in a salad?  Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't put my finger on it... I will say they are not shy about the toppings, though... You should be able to find some lettuce under all that bacon, egg, ham, tomatoes and almonds... The sun-dried tomato dressing was pretty good, though...",

    "text": "Woot woot! I love me some Hickory Tavern - this chain is blowing up! I like Hickory Tavern for their selection of drinks, their plentiful TVs, and most of all, their WINGS! They have a special offer for tailgating (to go) with all your traditional tailgating foods, and they even have a suggested menu for game-watching in the restaurant. Of those offerings, I'll talk about three of them here.  THE FOOD:  I tried the brats (not a fan - mine was under cooked and tasted like beer... not just beer-flavored, but I think I got a buzz from eating two bites!). Now, their wings are what makes them a winner! Get them extra crispy and with ranch (who orders them with blue cheese anymore - weirdos, that's who!) He he! On top of that, their ranch is equally good (any True wing connoisseur knows the ranch is VERY important!) I also tried the chicken salad sliders which were delicious. They were made with whole meat white chicken breast (not the canned junk), mayo of course, thinly sliced celery and dried cranberries that gave it the perfect sweetness.   THE VENUE: This is a brand new location (in the same building/area as the Target, Best Buy, Trader Joe's... It was really cool inside. It's part of a chain so it's similar to the other locations I've been to (this restaurant chain is blowing up!), but had some features that were really unique. I loved the chrome quote on the bar wall. They have tons of TVs to watch any/every game your sports-loving-heart desires. They have a ticker, yes a ticker, for sports scores above the hostess stand. There's a huge and well-appointed bar with cool lighting. Plus all the seating you could need. They host all the home Panthers games, and get this, at each game they do a raffle for free Panthers swag. Nice! Parking was a breeze in the deck - it's crowded but what deck isn't. I'm also glad parking was free. What can I say, I'm cheap!  So, go for the beer/drinks, TV, wings and open atmosphere. Enjoy!",

    "text": "So... this review probably should have been written 3 months ago - the last time I went.  Came here for an event thrown by my friend's apt complex - Hickory had free food and a couple of free drinks.  The first thing you notice about stepping into this place is how clean it is and how many TV screens that they have everywhere.  Maybe it's because it's located in the Met, but tidiness is often overlooked. Everything was shiny - something Mr. Clean could appreciate.  And there was numerous TVs everywhere.  When I came back in January, you could pretty much find any game on TV.  It was a little loud in there which made it difficult to chat at times, but this was/felt like/is a sports bar.  And to confirm this... (read below).  The food was very average, but I expected that given that it was mass-produced and served in catering trays for everyone that showed up.  Service was solid, servers all had a pulse.    Oh yeah, love it when the hostess opens the door for the guests and greets with a smile.  Not all restaurants do that, they should.  dmo out.",

It was made up of mayo, a ton of red onions, and very little spinach and artichokes not to mention that the large (which was recommended for our family of 4) was smaller than the average size and expensive ($9).  The buffalo chicken sandwich was decent but could be the cause of major stomach issues the next day and the turkey sandwich was loaded again with purple onions even though we ordered it without.    Disappointed and will not be returning.",

Perhaps I was madd hungry that day; but what should have been a regular food experience turned into an annoyance. I was there for a meeting, so I didn't want to ask for anything else; especially when there were like 13 other people in the group that needed their food, condiments, drinks refilled.

    "text": "So I have been to Hickory Tavern many many times before. I am actually suprised I havent reviewed it until now. The view of the city is incredible and it is conveniently located in the Met, so we usually hit it before a Trader Joe's grocery shopping trip!   Usually my husband and I get the Build Your Own Salads. 6 ingredients for $9. The oriental dressing is amazing and bacon and avocado on a salad is just A-mazing. In addition, I love that Hickory has Red Oak on tap. They have alot of local beers on draft and I love that about a restaurant.  However, this review is more specifically directed to a situation we had today for lunch at HT. My husband and I decided to grab our typical BYO salads. I don't know what was going on but it took a long time to get our food. 25-30 minutes to get a salad is kinda crazy (I mean there wasnt even any cooked meat on it.....all raw ingredients!).Our waitress was super sweet though and came by saying that she had no idea why we hadn't gotten our food yet and that it should be there soon. We finally got our salads and dug in.....yummy dressing! However, about half way into the salad, my husband looks up and pulls out a piece of cardboard from his salad. It was about 2 inches by a half inch. Gross. We have both worked in the food industry and know that those boxes are dragged across the floor when being brought in. All I could picture is that nasty cardboard piece being spread across that whole (since the dressing was tossed into the salad).   The waitress was, once again, very sweet and didnt really know what to do and grabbed her manager. The manager came out and was talking about boxing up the salad to go. I am assuming she was talking about boxing up a new salad and not the one with the cardboard in it....I dont know. She also offered us a free brownie. Honestly, we didnt really want any other food at the time. They did comp his salad (which was very sweet, hence the 2 stars instead of 1) and charged me for mine. It was just kinda weird. I mean she did apologize but it just came across like it wasnt a big deal.   Kinda frustrating that we had this happen cause we LOVED going to Hickory Tavern in the past! I'm not sure if we will be back soon, simply cause I keep picturing that nasty piece of cardboard. Plus, there are so many other places to eat in the Met!",

Hockey, baseball, basketball, you name it.  And then there was the Korean BBQ tacos. A lil fusion twist to it but I loved it. It almost had a hot sauce flavor in it which isn't how we normally make Korean bbq. Uf we want to make it hot, we use lepper paste called gochujang with a dufferent flavor. But it was pretty close. And you know what? Not everything has to be the same. Different is good. It's not like they hold themselves out as a Korean restaurant. Well, enough about food.  I was hoping for a highland gaelic ale, which they didn't have but a couple of good ole OMB Captain Jack did the job. Fireball shots were nice too. And service was great, too. Liz was so nice and on top of it. I'd go back soon if I could. Anyway, I had a great time with friends watching a good game and nothing went wrong so 5 stars!",

Furthermore, the room itself was perfect for an intimate group of 30 or less people. You get a fabulous view of the Charlotte skyline out the windows. I would definitely have an event here again!",

But only thing is my friend was Browns fan and the only 2 tvs his game was on were in the far corners that we couldn't really see from our table..  And they wouldn't switch any other TV so he could see it.  But besides that the place was pretty good..  Our waitress was awesome and very attentive to us.  We had reserved a table which was nice since we had about 10 people with us.   The tables are kind of really close to each other so on days that it is crowded like on Sundays,  it is really hard to get around without bumping into chairs or people.  They just need to spread the tables out a little bit.  They do have a really nice patio area with tvs outside which was really nice looking.",

Probably one of the best burgers that I ate in Charlotte ever. The restaurant is great, they have a ton of TV's covering almost every sport from Hockey, Basketball, Baseball (and Football when it's Sunday) and covering every angle you look at. When we ate here, the heat game was playing in the background while we ate so it wasn't that boring. Atmosphere is great for lunch or dinner.  Sadly, when we got there our first server forgot my Sprite while he got the rest of our drinks. But then once our second server came, she brought it to me when she looked at the table.  It's like a Duffy's (a sports bar in Florida) but in Charlotte.",

    "text": "First thing you gotta know about this Hick Tav location is that the parking can be atrocious given everything that Is The Met...it is what it is, accept that going in...  Second thing you gotta know....the menu is expansive and contains what I would call \"Deluxe Bar Food\".  It has all your standard bar menu offerings, but everything is a notch above what you might expect from a sports bar.  Take their wings for example, all of their flavors are great - from the Hot Buffalo style, to the Bee Stings up top.  But what separates the wings is that they offer them CHARRED!!!  That's right folks, for a slight up-charge, they'll throw them on the grill for a min or two and charr your wings for you - a step above.  LOVE is the first word that comes to mind when I think of the crab dip.  Although its served hot, thick and full of crabs (that what she said, I think, lol), its the warm pita bread that I really love.  When you first sink your teeth into the Colorado chicken, and it has a chance to melt over your taste-buds, you'll just have to be quiet, close your eyes, and shake your head - its that good.  The cali-Chicken sandwich is also phenom.    Third thing you gotta know...the service and servers are always awesome.  That's one thing I've noticed about this Hick Tav, no matter when you go - lunch, dinner, late night, yelp event, or what their level of busyness, the service is always great.  I've even had a fantasy football draft in the back room and my buddies and I were all treated like royalty.    Fourth thing you gotta know...BEEEEER.  Yea, that's right, know what kind of beer you like because this place has dozens of beers on tap from local, to national, to international.  It's a beer lovers paradise.  That certainly doesn't mean you're out of place ordering a cocktail of your liking either.    I'm definitely a fan of this Hick Tav location,  food + beers + dozens of flat screens = GREAT Sports Bar option near uptown Charlotte!.",

I love that you can order half size of the appetizers ... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are!  I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner.   This is a great choice, and one a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!",

We asked her for some condiments - never got them. We had to ask for refills - and then she seemed annoyed. Instead of \"serving\" our food and drinks, she would just hand them to us and make us pass stuff down the table. There was a frozen fry in someone's meal too.

Only one, the last one returned to tell us it would be a few more minutes because the ticket times were messed up in the kitchen. She did say she spoke to a manager and they were coming out food. The lobster roll was mediocre at best. My husbands burger didn't come with cheese as discussed in detail about which kind. Finally, my sons food (pasta) arrived after we had long finished our meals. We never saw a server again. The food is not great. The service was the worst I have ever experienced. The restaurant was half full and I could except mistakes but it would have been nice for a manager of server to follow up with us.

Great location, nice outdoor area, jammed packed (it was a Thursday night). We started our night inside while waiting for a table to open up outside. The food was good and the beers were cold. The service, however, was bad. Our waitress, Rachel, acted like she could have cared less about us. No smiles, no friendly small talk, barely any service at all. She treated us like we were a hassle. When we finally got our table outside she explained to the other waiter that she was too busy with a big table to keep helping us. Thanks, thanks a lot. Let me say this, I'm huge on service!! Food & atmosphere can be incredible but if the service sucks, it will ruin the experience. I'm just hoping she was having a bad night but it still doesn't excuse the action or lack there of.",

I can keep my $$ and still enjoy the patio and the view (and the jazz music if there's a concert happening) I particularly enjoy the fact that they offer half portion on appetizers and a la carte on the tacos.  The half nacho was plenty big, for $5. Sold!  Their small tavern salad (also $5) was filling too, and I had mine with the cucumber wasabi dressing, which defintely has a kick to it.  The lobster salad side I added was a little too salty (crazy statement coming from me) and not sure if it's worth $6.  Next time I'll pair my small salad with a shrimp taco or something.   Plenty of TV for the sports addicts.  Decent beer specials ($3 or $4 pint of Shocktop, or was it Blue Moon... getting old, I can't remember much) .  The space inside actually isn't that big, but they have a nice private room that I think is great for a special gathering.   Definitely a great weekend hang out during the day when the weather is nice!",

Of course I didn't want to sit in the sun so I replied I would wait. As we waited to be seated people behind us were being seated. After waiting 20 minutes I told the ladies I was ready to leave. They told me they had seats inside and they thought we wanted to sit outside and told us to wait a few minutes and they would seat us. We sat so my daughter could eat. I had lost my appetite and didn't even want anything. After being seated, two women with dogs were seated next to us and we're barking and one of the waitresses started playing with the dogs. No thank you. I'm REALLY not hungry anymore. I'm really ready to go. Used to be my favorite place to eat... Omg!!! What a damper on my day!!!",

While she does look pretty good for her age, the episode was utterly ridiculous.  A nervous manager came over with free chips and salsa, but we will never go there again.  I mean, if she was 90 years old, would they still refuse to serve w/o ID?  Are they really afraid of being busted for serving a 49 year old?!?",

    "text": "I just moved back to Charlotte several months ago and this Hickory Tavern in Metropolitan is fantastic! Food is always good, ,location is perfect (the views, right on the Greenway, ample parking and close to where I live), but there is one big reason I keep coming back! Ishmail, the bartender! Such a genuine, friendly guy! Always shakes your hand, always has a smile, so welcoming, remembers your drink.....So many establishments in Charlotte should get this guy to train your bartenders. Let's face it, everyone wants to be \"Norm on Cheers\" (where you come in and get a welcome, your drink waiting, etc.....) Ishmail makes that happen! There are a lot of restaurants/bars in uptown. I have the great luxury of choosing from so many close to my place, but I always choose the places based on 3 things: 1. Quality of food           2. How cold the Corona's are and  3. The bartender's friendliness, respect for the customer! Hickory-Metro AND thanks to Ishmail, \"hit a home run\" on all three! And to top it off, the Fall music they have on Thursday nights outside and even having one of the best local bands (\"Simplified\") on Thanksgiving Wednesday is \"icing on the cake\"!",

My first impression was under-whelming.  The decor, even for a sports bar was nothing special despite the high rent location.  The service was overly friendly.  The server sat at the table with us on several occassions which I find annoying especially when trying to enjoy the compnay of my guest, not the wait staff.  The food was also unremarkable.  I had the fish tacos which were acceptable but my guest had the blue cheese hamburger.  He remarked that the beef was over seasoned and over cooked.  The blue cheese was crumbled and concentrated in the middle of the burger.  You could visably see him choking it down.  Now the beer was cold and I always appreciate a good selection.  If I ever return, it will be for the beer not the food.",

If you plan to only go to the bar to order a drink and watch the game, this place is probably fine. However my experiences have been simple meals take a long time to be served and management has been less than stellar handling any issues that pop up.   I've been to this location probably 5 times in the last 3 years. Originally my wife and I were in love with this location as the patio is gorgeous, you have ample seating outside, and the build your own salads were a great, light alternative fare to normal pub food. On one particular occasion, I found a large piece of cardboard in my salad. Leaves me to question the prep staff of the place. Also the manager at the time seemed very laid back about the whole thing, and only comped my salad. I left that day feeling very angry and hungry as we had waited over half an hour to get the salad after ordering. It was a while before we went back.  We did try this place again recently and the experience again was just OK. We enjoyed sitting outside on a Monday evening, but experienced a waiter that was often nowhere to be found. Between the time we ordered our meal and got our check it was almost 90 minutes - a really long time for two people on one of the quietest nights of the week. Due to the consistent lack of a good experience, I unfortunately cannot give this place a higher rating. Hopefully everyone else will have a better experience than me.",

There was barely any chicken or cheese. I also got the chicken salad sandwich which had huge chinch of chicken and just not appetizing to me as I'm used to chicken salad being small or shredded chicken. I only ate half of it because I didn't even want the rest. My friend got the fish tacos which she was happy with. Our server was great though and very attentive. This place is still great for the view outside on a nice day and a beer but would recommend eating elsewhere.  Can't rate the food as I just came here for a beer but it seems like a pretty cool place. Phenomenal place to sit on the back patio on a beautiful 78 degree day like today. View of the city doesn't get much better. Food from other tables looked food, would def come again to try out. Very large beer list and laid back atmosphere. Waitress was very attentive even though we were only getting drinks.",

I was shocked too because I have been here before and order other things and it wasn't as good... not bad just not as good as last night. Another thing to try is their buffalo chicken sandwich. Real Good!  If you like it a little spicy! ;) well my attitude is spicy so I like it spicy! Ha!  GREAT PLACE TO WATCH ANY SPORTING EVENT too!!!

    "text": "Was in town on business. After some light shopping I decided to stop in for food and drink.  Place was pretty much empty and I was the only one at the bar at about 4:30.  Bartender was very nice.... but when I asked if it was Happy Hour.... he honestly said\" I really don't know.... let me check\". Left came back... said he still didn't know. I find that utterly weird! He made up for that with some menu selections and conversation on the local Baseball team.  I started with oysters. They were quite good and fresh. Of course I asked where they were from.... he had to ask.  His shift was over so he was nice enough to come over to say he was leaving.  I had no idea who was replacing him as I was never approached to say that they would take over.  When I finally saw a woman behind the bar.. I asked for a menu. She handed me the menu and never said a word.  Had to get her attention to order more food.  Keep in mind... there now was maybe 9 people at the bar.  I ordered more food. It was just okay.  I'll look for a different watering hole next time.  One that has Happy Hour and actually knows what it entails. Oh and as I was leaving. ...3 people at the \"hostess\" station. ( one very well dressed woman ). Assuming she was a manager. Not one goodbye or thank you for stopping in, they were too busy talking amongst themselves.",

    "text": "My wife's coworker suggested we give Hickory Tavern a try...specifically the charred wings, to which I obliged. I really enjoyed them. They had a nice char and were extremely crispy. I enjoy spicy food so I ordered them hot but the level of heat was pretty wimpy if you ask me. The char and the flavor of the sauce complimented each other quite nicely though. I also had a side Caesar salad which isn't on the menu but when the bill came I saw it was $7. The dressing was right on but the portion size was tiny for the price. My wife had the Tavern burger with the house made chips and said it was just OK. The service was excellent from the time we walked in the door until we left but it did take an unusually long time for the food to come out of the kitchen which was odd because there were only 3 or 4 other occupied tables in the entire place. With all that being said, I would probably go back for the charred wings. They were pretty dang good.",

They tend to \"overdress\" their salads, so always ask for dressing on the side. They have some tasty and traditional bar food options, and their buffalo chicken tacos always hit the spot.

Switched my flight to an earlier one and made it in time to watch the Falcons lose... in historic fashion.  Yes, still salty about it.  However, Hickory Tavern made it easy to be able to watch the game on one of many, many TVs they have in the restaurant.   Hickory Tavern, located in the Metropolitan Complex, is your basic sports bar with basic bar food and lots of big TVs and even a projector.  They have plenty of tables (bar, stool, booth, and table) and also space outside.  It was conveniently located within walking distance to the Sheraton/Le Meridien hotels, which we were staying at.  Making a reservation over the phone was easy peasy and we had our table as soon as we got there.  Service was pretty good, considering it was Super Bowl.  We didn't get a menu for a while, but after ordering, someone was always checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  The food itself was just okay.  We ordered a dozen oysters and these were the biggest oysters I'd ever seen... but they also were some of the worst oysters I've ever had.  Tasted like straight ocean and had a really weird texture.  Meh.  We also ordered hot wings which were pretty much your basic hot wings.  Nothing to call home about.  Now, the sweet potato fries and the tater tots we ordered with it - THAT's where it was at.  Scarfed those things down like nobody's business.  I liked that they were nice and crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.  Yum.  The queso and chips was also very solid.  Needless to say, I left the place pretty bummed due to the outcome of the game, but I'm glad I was able to find somewhere decent to watch the game that wasn't overly crowded or too quiet, and within walking distance from the hotel.",

I've had decent food at Hickory Tavern, and this stop was about the same.  The reuben was completely average from top to bottom. The corned beef was standard deli meat, the kraut came from a package, marbled rye was the bread of choice, and the cheese was mild yet plentiful. The biggest issue the sandwich had was how it was made (see picture if you can find it). The corned beef was on one side of the sandwich, and the kraut was on the other side. This made the sandwich a little sub-par from bite to bite, although I know that's likely not the case most of the time in there (just got stuck with a bad chef that night). The reuben was pretty much middle of the pack based on what I've had around Charlotte.",

Tonight before a dinner locally, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to pay a return visit. The thing I remembered most was the awesome and extensive beer list. Yes, the beer list is in fact two pages long! One third on tap, the other two thirds in bottle or can. Local brews have a strong representation here including, Birdsong, OMB, Triple C and Sugar Creek.   I can't resist Triple C 3C IPA - it's just one of the best out there. Just when I thought I had gone through the menu thoroughly, my buddy, John spotted Bengali Sixpoint IPA - how did I miss that???! (because the list is so damn big, that's why). Our bartender, who by the way had a terrific sense of humor and joked around with us, gave me a 4 oz sympathy sampler of the Bengali. Wow! Now that's cool and classy! Me likey!  If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a place for a brew, some wings, apps or a burger at a reasonable price (all while watching sports)- this place may just fit the bill! Indoor tailgating for grownups!!!",

The salads at the table looked good but has very off combinations of flavors, not to mention they are served in a mixing bowl.

It's a piece of fried pork belly, pickled onions and lettuce with a wasabi sauce.  The taco was OK.  Pork belly a little over cooked, and only one small piece.  It was basically a soft tortilla with a LOT of lettuce and very little pork belly.  The wasabi sauce was awesome, but probably wouldn't order again or recommend. Overall, the food and service is always good.  Unlike the fact they offer different options, let's see how they can improve and deliver on those limited time specials.",

I sat at the bar and waited for my friends. The bar tender was nice and she asked what wanted. We talked for a few minutes and she checked in on my every now and then. I ordered a tall Angry Orchard which is one of the main reasons I will continue to go to HT is because they have this cider on tap.   My friend ordered a drink and the other ordered a drink and salad. I enjoyed my beer and my friends seemed to enjoy the atmosphere. I would come back for the draft cider and the atmosphere. I have never been a fan of their food which is why I can't give them 5 stars.",

I love the setup, the amount of TVs is perfect!!! The space, the location of the TVs are well placed as you don't have to strain anywhere you sit. I even was impressed with the menu options and variety for a social place like this. The bathroom was very clean which somewhat surprised me but I appreciated it. The pricing of the food was inexpensive, I got 2 shrimp tacos and sweet potato fries and then the cheesecake dessert for about $19. So I was very pleased with the price. The issue with this visit was the waiter who made us wait because it seemed like she had an attitude. We were sitting for maybe 15 minutes before even being acknowledged by a waiter. Shanti eventually came and helped us even though this was not her section and she was phenomenal! The other issue though small but has to be mentioned if I am going to be honest because I really enjoyed this place and want them to be successful. The meal my friend ordered was missing 2 items that they specifically asked for. Shanti definitely took care of every issue and we appreciate her for stepping up and taking over! Regardless of this visit, I will definitely be back as I know this place is 5 star worthy!",

My salad came without silverware and I had t wait for it to be brought out. The food was tasty, although fried a little too hard.

We live in the NODA area but wanted to try something different and we were at Best Buy so why not eat in the local area. After looking and walking into several spots we decided on Hickory tucked away slightly off the main strip overlooking the bike path.  Our waitress Katy was super attentive, I mean wow at one point I was wondering if we were her only table. She had a few table she was just really on it so I truly appreciated the world class service .  We ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari which I'm so over critical because I really enjoy it. I asked Katy to have them lightly fried which she said would relay to the cook. Literally if you fry them to much they look fine while they are hot but once they start to cool down their stiff as a board. They came out exactly how I didnt want them. We were pressed for time with a pending party looming over us so I ate a few. The fiancee ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast smothered in Onions which I'm told was amazing! There was no complaints so that's a positive .  The Playoff football games were playing so we watched a few of those, Katy checked on us a few more times and we paid/left.  We would definitely come back again if we're in the area. Clean atmosphere, family friendly, attentive Katy and welcomed upon entering and leaving. This would have been a 5  experience if weren't for that freaking calamari.",

Appetizers, burgers, chicken sandwiches, tacos, wings, steak, ribs, and salads. It has something for everyone.   You can't go wrong with the Tavern Burger or the Southern Fried Chicken BLT.   Plenty of televisions with different programs on.  An open and lighter atmosphere giving it an upper scale feel than most taverns.   The Metropolitan area itself is really nice. While a small area of businesses it has everything you need.  Target, BJ, Staples, Marshall's, Trader Joe's, Which Wich, Zoe's Kitchen to name a few. There are other upscale restaurants where they offer valet  after dinner you can shop at CRIV, west elm or grab a smoothie at Smoothie Cafe or dessert at le macaron and others!  Very nice area.",

Overall it was good but not overwhelmingly so. The asparagus was nicely seasoned but the salmon was just ok.  The atmosphere is rather loud so if you're looking for intimacy the isn't the place to go.  My friend had the crab legs which she really enjoyed. I'd definitely frequent this place again and try other items on the menu.   Went back today for a to-go order - Build your own salad and crab dip. I was totally disappointed with both.  Asked for mixed greens, received iceberg. I added avocado and received 1/2 a slice.  The salmon (the protein I added) was dry, the salad dressing (ranch) was bland and the crab dip was hard and dry. I think I'm done with this place.  I spent $26 to come home to a tasteless meal.",

They have a food truck menu as well as a typical bar menu that includes nachos, wings, and crab legs. When entering the restaurant, I observed for it to be mildly clean and slightly busy for a week day. This was possibly due to their location.   My co-worker and I were seated and took a few minutes for a server to come. We ordered quickly. She ordered the bbq nachos and I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with tater tots. He highlight of my meal was the tater tots. The tots were crunchy and tasted amazing with their honey mustard. The grilled chicken sandwich was overpriced and not any better than one from chick fil a.   I don't think I will return.",

The place is large and lively and the bartenders are very friendly.  I had the wings with hot sauce and they were quite good.  I decided to get them with Tater Tots which were also good and heavy on the salt.  The raw oysters here were also quite good and gigantic.  The menu here is great and I plan on returning soon.",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant on July 7 around 3:10pm.  Hardly any patrons at that time and we decided to sit on the patio. There is a sign posted \"cigar smoking allowed after 9pm\". A patron is sitting on the patio smoking a cigar and I advised the waitress who called the manager over to talk to the patron. After the manager politely whispered something to the patron and walked off, he continued to smoke his cigar blowing the smoke in my direction. We were considering leaving at that point but after about 7 additional minutes, the smoking patron left so we decided to stay since we had already placed our orders.  A female walked outside and began to smoke her cigarette. After about another 20 minutes, the manager comes to our table to advise that the ingredients needed to make our appetizer was not in stock and we could order a different item. She did not offer to compensate and when asked why it took so long to let us know that the ingredients weren't available, she replied that they were \"trying to make it work\". At this time, we decided to leave but not before getting the managers name, Emily.  I'm sure she would have not made the smoking lady put out her cigarette either. Very disappointed in the service we received from the manager. We frequent this restaurant for their bee sting wings but I'm not sure if I will ever return to this location or hickory tavern in general.",

It is a sports bar so it was loud but we were prepared for that and the staff was happy to accommodate us even though we were the only customers on the patio. I got a beer sampler where I chose 4 different beers and loved it! I chose the fish tacos and was not as impressed as I was hoping but they were still delicious and I ate every bite! The service was great and everyone else seemed extremely friendly. I want to go back and trying the oysters on the half shell! Will definitely be returning but will make sure it's to watch a game and not to have conversations with family I had not seen in months!",

Hostess informed me that they were steering people inside, so my comment was, \"Well, it's beautiful outdoors, you close at 12:00AM, I'm hungry and I'm sure I won't be staying outdoors until closing\". Nope, She wouldn't budge. What's the difference if they clean a table indoors or outdoors?  Families were outdoors and still sitting there when I left. Annoying. Felt singled out.",

Full of TVs, nice sized bar with wood accents and mostly tables in lieu of booths.  For the record, I'll always prefer a booth!  The food seemed consistent with the other locations as well but the beer list is always the reason to come here.  Massive selection and always cold.    The service was nice and friendly, although the order kinda got screwed up because maybe there was more tableside chatter than actually paying attention to what was being ordered.  Nothing too serious though and nothing too drastic.  Downside to this site though is the parking situation.  I think they may have a valet otherwise you are going to probably have to park in the parking garage across the street.  Good luck with that.",

It's a bit overwhelming having all the games on simultaneously and avid football fans hooting and hollering whenever their team does well.  Managed to snag a large table (there were 8 of us) and our server was awesome.  She did bring out the wrong food order, but I attribute it to the loudness of the room and how crazy busy they were.  I ended up taking the food \"for the team\" and it wasn't bad.  Actually I ordered chicken fingers (buffalo) but the mixed up order landed me with buffalo chicken tacos - which were good.  A bit healthier than I wanted to go that day, but I need all the help I can get.  This location has a great patio/outdoor space that looks out onto Sugar Creek and also the downtown skyline.  Probably the only negative I could slightly attribute to this place is the crazy parking deck it shares with the Midtown stores (Trader Joes, BestBuy, etc).  I think there must be a time warp where everyone starts making bad judgement calls once they drive into this parking structure.",

    "text": "I came here after learning the four star pizza restaurant I wanted to go to was closed. I checked out Hickory on Yelp to see what others thought. I figured I could grab a bite to eat and stay for the game. The service wasn't bad. The hostess was pleasant and the bartender was very nice. I totally forgot her name. Anyway. I played it safe with wings and fries. I have to say the wings actually sucked. Some places just don't get wings right. There was absolutely no flavor with them. The wing sauce nor the blue cheese saved them. To save face and make myself feel better, I ate all the wings but left a portion of the fries. To their credit, the sweet potato fries had a honey butter sauce that was rather tasty and intriguing. Unfortunately, they could not save the wings. I had a local beer which wasn't bad by far. Needless to say, I wouldn't return here unless I only intended to drink or it was a late night and I was starving. And I didn't stay for the game.",

    "text": "I know I've given them multiple chances since it is conveniently located near work for me, and I keep thinking that this is going to get better.  The times I have gone here or have gotten take out, it has only been for lunch.  I think that the food is always good, so that's the reason that I go back, but the service is not all that spectacular.  I've had many bad experiences hoping that it'll just get better and am still waiting for it to happen.  Once experience I had, I had gone out to lunch with my coworkers and ordered a Build Your Own Salad and had requested for some fried chicken.  Our food came out, but the friend chicken came 15 minutes after my salad had come out.  The server asked me (with a sort of attitude) if I still wanted the chicken or not.  I said sure.  The manager asked if everything was okay, I told him of the situation, and he didn't seem that concerned, but he did take 50% off my bill.    Other experiences I've had, I have learned to now check if my food is correct for take out before getting back to work.  Examples: No extra ranch when I asked for it, another time, I had ordered sweet tea to go only to find out once I got back to the office they gave me unsweet tea, having to ask them for ketchup when I already told them in my order that I wanted some ketchup on the side.  It's those things that have happened to me.  I just hope that they can step up their game because I do enjoy their food, but their service just really needs a lot of work.",

    "text": "CONSISTENTLY VERY GOOD. Where chain food can be shaky with the quality and consistency, you have NOTHING to worry about here! They have a small outdoor seating area so if you can snag a table that faces into Uptown the views are great. Why bother eating at Dresslers (their neighbor) when you can eat here for half the price. This restaurant is casual so you can just stop in for some beers. I've been several times and had the burger, wings, pretzels, and cedar plank salmon (extra well done please. Seriously, you can't kill it enough). All items were excellent. My guests have had the salads, rib eye, & filet and they enjoyed every bite. There is a menu item called 'bucket of boat trash' for $29. It's some kind of seafood mix. For $29 I would never order anything with the word trash in it. I'm sure it's tongue in cheek, but the Hickory Tavern marketing execs may want to rethink this one.   My only gripe about this place is the parking in the Metropolitan. It's not Hickory Taverns fault. Every time I park there everyone has road rage trying to squeeze in a space. You get frustrated and anxious and end up parking on the 5th floor just to wait for an elevator and end up being late for dinner. TIP: Where ever you do park in the garage, take the stairs and walk down as you will get there faster.",

We didn't order drinks, although I hear they have plenty of options.  All in all, I'd say that it's a decent location to watch a game and have a drink. For me, however, the sheer number of TVs was overwhelming and my entire meal felt pretty schizophrenic.   It will do in a pinch, but not my first or sixth choice, for that matter. There are much better options at the Met.",

Parking is a bit tricky so I ended up on the 3rd floor in front of Marshalls.   Once we were across the street and inside we picked a spot at the bar. My husband ordered an OMB Copper and I got the $4 special Crown Royal. We basically just hung out and watched basketball (March Madness). Our waitress was Amber, and she seemed to be the only working the bar, which was where the majority of people were. She introduced herself and asked us our names as well (a first for me). She was very friendly.   I would definitely go back to visit and for a drink.",

It was a very thoughtful gesture.   There flatbreads are also delicious.   Definitely a great place to see the city from a different view after a nice walk on the greenway.",
