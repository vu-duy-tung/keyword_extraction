    "text": "Hand's down my favorite \"Mexican\" restaurant in Charlotte...but be sure to make a reservation as it is always crazy packed.  The guacamole is a must-have, as well as the sangria or one of the multiple flavors of margaritas. I've tried quite a few items on the menu (chopped salad, tortilla soup, enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos, and fajitas) and all are out of this world (multiple vegetarian options are also available). As I said, we frequent this restaurant.  Cantina has great happy hour specials if you're sitting at the bar between 4-7pm during the week. And the patio is a good place to hang out with friends in the spring/fall. The servers are always friendly and on top of their sections. Only downside is that you have to be careful where you park. They're sticklers for towing where signs are posted - highly recommend you use the valet.  And before you leave, be sure to get the Tres Leches cake. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "I just made my second trip to 1511 and I will choose somewhere else next time.  I have been eating at Mama Ricotta's for 15+ years, and have eaten at Big Daddy's a couple of times--I enjoy both of the sister restaurants so I do not know what the problem is with this restaurant.  On our first trip I wanted to start with the guacamole that I read so much about on Yelp.  We ordered it, and just when we were starting to think that the service was really slow--it was a packed Saturday night--our entrees came out.  When the manager that brought our food ask if we had everything we needed I told him we never got our appetizer, so please cancel that order.  He apologized and offered to bring it out now, but we declined since our dinner was there.  They did give us a coupon for a free guacamole which I thought took care of the situation.  Another manager came by and apologized, as did our waitress who we saw less of than the waitstaff at all the tables around us.  The food was pretty good, so I knew we would try it again.  Trip two.  We got there early this time, well before the crowd, and ordered the guacamole (forgot the darn coupon!) and a beer to start, while we looked at the menu.  My beer came out, we ordered entrees, the guac came out and before we could enjoy 3-4 chips our entrees hit the table.  They seem determined that I will not get to enjoy any guacamole.  Well equally determined, I slid my dinner aside and dug into the chips.  Truthfully, it was wasted effort.  It really wasn't that good.  There was very little flavor.  Unless they snuck it in while I wasn't looking there was no garlic, no salt, and no pepper added.  I doctored it at the table, but I have had better pre-made from the grocery store and that isn't $9.00.  I usually choose a local place over a chain when possible, and I really wanted to enjoy 1511 but the entrees are nothing special and the service did not meet my expectations.  The prices were higher than say \"On the Border\" and while I never felt like a sombrero-wearing group would start singing happy birthday to the table next to us, that was hardly enough to bring me back. Adios Cantina 1511.",

    "text": "I've put off reviewing Cantina 1511 for a while. It's one of those upscale Mexican places where a plate of tacos can put you back $20, and I'm just not sure it's worth it. Yes, the tableside guacamole is good, as it always is, but is it any better than what I make at home? If you try to go whenever people like to go out for dinner, there can be a wait and valet parking, which is always a pain. So, I guess what I'm saying is, it's good, but it's not as good as it thinks it is.  But you know when I love going to Cantina? When I've got a hungry crowd to feed. The family style option is a fun way to experience a lot of different things on the menu for not a ton of cash.  PS Get the barbacoa. You're welcome.",

    "text": "I like 1511 ok....it's a trendy spot spot for some fresh Tex-Mex. It's a little pricey for what you get. The Enchiladas de Denis are good, but everything borders dangerously close on being wayyyy too smothered in sauces of one variety or another (or both at the same time). You can kind of lose the rest of the food underneath all the sauce, and in turn, it makes the dishes overwhelmingly rich.  I always leave with a doggy bag (not necessarily a bad thing!) due to the food being so heavy!  Or it could be the massive amounts of chips and salsa I consume before the food arrives.....  I'm a sucker for table-side service....be it a bananas foster, waiter prepared caesar, carved whole duck.  So needless to say, I enjoyed the tableside guacamole.  But there is an operational advantage here too...when avocadoes oxidize, they turn brown and mushy.  Even after adding lime juice, it can still lead to a disappointing guac experience when you get a bowl of brownish green goo.  Good guac is creamy, not gooey!  You get the good guac here.  An overzealous waiter sqeezed some lime right into my eye when we were dining with some friends here on our last visit.  Made for some comedic relief to the dinner convo.  This place is always packed, so don't be surprised if dinner takes a little while to come out.  All in all not my favorite mexican spot, but I still come here about once a month, either for lunch with colleagues or dinner with the wife.  So I can't really bash too hard on a place I return to with some level of frequency!",

    "text": "My boyfriend is from San Francisco and I am from Atlanta, but we have lived in Charlotte for about a year now. Unfortunately, we have yet to find Mexican food here that satisfies our high standard cravings. We ventured to Cantina 1511 last weekend to give it a try. It was definitely good, but not nearly as divine as the delicious authentic Mexican restaurant in my hometown or the amazing California burritos that my boyfriend is accustomed to from back home. We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas after wavering over whether or not to make the investment. Unfortunately, our $28 pitcher of margaritas almost entirely consisted of super-sour mix rather than much tequila. We decided to try the guacamole, made table side by our waiter. He asked how much spice did we want, to which I said, \"a little bit.\" Apparently, I should have asked him to make it as spicy as possible - it barely had any kick to it and was less flavorful than Harris Teeter's guacamole (and definitely no Chipotle, either). It was Saturday evening, but our waiter seemed very busy. He slowly refilled our chips and drinks. Yes, I understand that it was peak busy hours, so I can cut him some slack for that. I ordered the entree salad topped with chicken. It was quite delicious! Flavorful, tender chicken, fresh veggies, and a nice mix of cheese and spicy-ish ranch dressing. It was also enormous - definitely get bang for your buck there. I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend had the Mexican Barbequed Pork plate, which was essentially carnitas. It came with only three flour tortillas, but a nice convo of rice, beans, guacamole, and pico de gallo. He enjoyed it, but it was nothing memorable. All in all, Cantina 1511 is certainly decent, but basically only on par with my expectations for a Mexican restaurant in North Carolina.",

We each had a margarita on the rocks, one Corona and we split the steak fajitas - total bill $58 with tip - not bad but I would have expected a little less splitting an entree. oh well.   The atmosphere was fun - got lucky with the leftover snow and ice outside b/c we were seated without having to wait even though the restaurant was mostly full.   Service was excellent. Good casual date spot.   My only gripe was that the fajitas needed a little more meat in addition to the ample amount of veggies - otherwise Cantina would have gotten 4 stars.",

    "text": "I LOVE CANTINA 1511. I could shout it from the hilltops, like Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music. Seriously, folks do-re-mi favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down.  The decor is Mexi-sexy, with low lighting, booths and tables both, and a great outdoor patio. The bar area is small, but cozy and always well stocked with local and imported beers.  The service = outstanding. Over the years I've been going, I have never had anything less than stellar service. I am one who is a stickler for good service (great food can be made OK when the waiter is a jerk), and this place gets 6 stars in that department.  Foodwise, I've never had anything that didn't make me say \"Oh my god, try this!\" to whoever my lucky date was. A good mix of texmex and authentic, I oftentimes get the 3 tacos with rice and beans. Now I am not ussually a taco person, but their taco options make it near impossible to resist: a chicken taco with pineapple salsa, taco al pastor with pork and greenchiles/habeneros salsa, a vegetarian hard taco smothered in red sauce with a medely of perfectly cooked vegetables inside that makes you wonder why you ever need to eat meat again, and a carne asada taco with onions that is so good you want to high five a cow.   Other hits include the pork entree (slow cooked in spices, falls off the bone, right into my mouth, mmmm), salmon (best salmon of MY LIFE), and the Nutella pie dessert. That dessert.... just try it. It will be one of the best decisions of your life besides having sex, getting married, having kids and buying that winning lotterry ticket.   Can you tell I love this place? If you're looking to go out with friends, a date, your mom or your parole officier, look no further. Cantina has something for everyone, with unmatched quality and superior service.",

I've just had wonderful dining experiences here and I would highly recommend it for a few venues:  1) girls or boys night out 2) laidback, but not too casual first date 3) celebration evening (i.e. birthday, anniversary)  Quick and dirty review:  1) Excellent, tasty food.  You must get the guacamole.  The waiter will make it right at your table with fresh, whole ingredients. 2) Service was outstanding.  Waiter was attentive, but sure not to rush us (even during restuarant week when the wait was over an hour). 3) Prices won't kill your wallet.  You're likely to even leave with leftovers.  Gotta love 2 meals for 1.   4) Drinks are very yummy. 5) Atmosphere is casual yet not too informal.  My only complaint is that during busy hours parking is very scarce.  Although, if you have a few bucks you can vallet!    Muy bueno, Cantina!",

I love the atmosphere of the place, you have the choice to sit inside or out...great music playing throughout...dim lighting, candles lit...I think this would make for a perfect first or second date night dinner :)  I had the chicken fajitas and they were wonderful - so much food that I couldn't finish it all!  The salsas were great, the guacamole was excellent, and the service was pretty good overall.  We all had a round or two of margaritas - they were ok, not mind blowing, and I thought they were rather weak (especially for 12 bucks a pop!).  If the drinks were better, I would've bumped this to a 5 star rating.  All of my friends that were with me seemed to really enjoy their food, for 3 of them it was the first time going - and they all said they would go back.    Overall, another great experience at Cantina, I'll just steer clear of the margaritas next time!",

We have always supported this local find, however we will not anymore.  I recently took my grandmother for a birthday lunch, and not a single item ordered was enjoyed and/or to quality of a good restaurant. We started the lunch with house margaritas, and neither one of us could drink more than two sips. They weren't mixed well, and the flavor was pure liquor... But not in a good way. The next issue was the guacamole. I will give grace here to the fact that avocados can be persnickety, and not always in season, but, apparently the guacamole recipe used there now is purely lime based. It was so heavily lime concentrated that you didn't taste anything else. It screamed for cilantro, and half the lime juice that was used. We both had different entrees. She selected the salmon salad, and I had the steak quesadilla. She said that the salmon salad tasted like it had been washed in water, and placed on the plate - zero seasoning and nothing worth mentioning. My quesadilla was burnt - flat out burnt. Tasted burnt, smelt burnt. The steak inside was grisly, and had no seasoning. Within 30 minutes to an hour of leaving, we both were regretting the stop at the restaurant... As we were burping up the food that we did nibble on. A manager needs to overhaul.",

'I'll wait till they move to revisit (had great experiences many times in the past).\"  \"When they move to Park Road, parking will be better, I'll wait\". \"Ok, they've moved and re-opened, but no liquor license, doesn't work for 'Girls Night', I'll wait\".  A month later, stop by for dinner on a Saturday night, 6:30, one hour wait, \"Good for them, doesn't work for me tonight, movie plans, \"I'll wait\"  Went today for lunch just before noon, no wait, Awesome.  Very attentive service, very nice wait staff, had all of our drinks refilled 4 times, mainly because it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive.  No special orders, basic burritos, torta.  Sorry, there was ONE special order: Big Burrito but without meat, no problem!  Food was decent for the most part, but the fries were cold and wimpy, and none of us had ever seen green peas in a  burrito before, or celery, but who were we to judge?!  So, overall, Meh experience so far.  Got the check, paid, wrapping up conversation when a MOUSE runs out from next to my chair and I watch it run clear across the restaurant floor underneath people's tables past their feet.    I am not an alarmist and don't generally draw attention to the negatives.  On my way out, I asked very discreetly, to speak to a manager, thinking he should know.  He was totally unfazed. Told me there had been other 'sightings' of mice, just hadn't been able to see where they were coming from, told me they would 'probably' call their exterminator to set traps. I told him exactly where 'my' mouse came from and he said 'ok, sorry about that. How was everything else?'    Poor response.  Maybe he shouldn't have told me that there were other sightings, but he offered that info and it was disturbing that no action had already been taken.  Not really wanting to eat where mice are running around and doing their thing.  Again, wait staff was very good, kitchen could have been quicker, great guacamole, but the mouse did me in (not to mention the lack of concern by the management).

I was expecting this place to have more vegetarian options on the menu.  There are a few, and the server suggested I replace the meat in a burrito with veggies (which I did), its just that I expected more options.  None of the Family-style meals are vegetarian (though I suppose you could ask, as they seemed fine with going off the menu).  But what I had was pretty good.  First up was the guacamole.  As several other reviewers have noted, Cantina makes their guacamole tableside.  It was very, very good, the right consistency/flavor/etc.  The only thing is that its $9, which seems really, really pricey to me (everything else seemed reasonably priced though).  My burrito was good too.  It wasn't anything fancy, just a burrito with sauteed veggies, rice, beans and queso.    So overall I liked this place.  Probably closer to 3.5 stars, but I have no problem bumping it up to a 4.",

    "text": "I have to admit, I'm very snobby about Mexican food, especially since I live in LA and I have traveled a few times to Mexico and had some great meals in these places. If I'm anywhere else in US (but Cali), I try to avoid Mexican because I feel like it won't measure up.  Our hosts wanted to take us to Cantina 1511 because they read good reviews about it - it's described as doing a modern twist on Mexican fare. We had a reservation, but still had to wait to get seated. The decor was just OK, the layout- the place is too wide, wherever you're seated you lack privacy. Not a fan.  The food - chips and salsa were OK. The guac was decent. The drinks- they have an extensive menu, we picked a drink- a new twist on Margarita, basically a pineapple drink on the rocks, it wasn't anything great, I barely could taste any alcohol, pretty weak.   The food, that's another story. We ordered tacos and enchiladas. Someone in our party hated her enchiladas (Enchiladas de Pollo), the tortilla was hard and it did look strange, like they were too baked, over cooked.   The tacos were OK (the selection was decent), we got Carne Asada, Ancho Pollo, Johnny Carnitas between us. The problem was the shell, it was so thin, that it broke once you had your first bite, which never happened to us before in a restaurant or at home (with shells you buy in stores). It was hard to enjoy them. The beans were fine, but my issue was with the rice. You serve white rice? Seriously? In a Mexican restaurant? It was blend, a bit sweet with some corn in it. The meal lacked authenticity, as I feared. Prices are high, I guess this is the \"upscale\" part.  The ambiance, there is none, they have huge TV-s, it's so loud that you can't have a conversation and I had to yell at our server so that he can take  my order. Not the way I like it. Also, we had a family with 3 kids behind us, so they placed a bassinet with a baby right behind my chair. And right when they brought my food, the other 2 kids started running  behind my chair, touching me, pushing me, yelling while the parents didn't seem to care less. Not an enjoyable, peaceful meal.   As far as the Mexican upscale twist, well that's just a publicity stunt. Skip it if you're really into good Mexican food!",

I think there is more seating now though ... so shorter wait times trump the mediocre decor.   Went back for my second trip to the new location this passed weekend ... make a reservation and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. On a crazy business Friday night at 7:30 ... i'm tottaly oaky with this. Our server knew his stuff, and our glasses were never empty.   Chip and salsa are good, nothing extraordinary. Ordered the Crab & Goat Cheese Croquetas and was very impressed. I can't bring my self to ever try anything but the tacos for me entree, because they're so damn good. The Marco Polo taco never fails to disappoint (must be the jalapeno bacon!). I'll definitely be back again.",

Lots of indoor and outdoor seating, a full bar, great ambiance, etc. As for the food: A+. There is a full specialty taco menu, quesadillas, burritos, enchiladas, appetizers galore, and plenty more. I ordered a chicken chimichanga and immediately ascended to the heavens upon the first bite.   The drinks are outstanding too. They have 10+ margaritas and just as many tequilas. Drink specials all week. What else could you want from a restaurant? Desert? Yeah they have that too.  Satisfied beyond expectations. Good work Cantina",

We started off with the Five Cheese Queso Fundido with chips, which was blended at the table over a warmer. I split the Ancho Chicken burrito and Wild Mushroom quesadilla; both of which had great flavor. And we ended the meal with a Cuatro Leches Cake. Typically, I am a chocolate-dessert kind of girl, but this cake was amazing. Very moist and flavorful. I have also had the Cobb Salad with Ancho Shrimp and was a great, healthier option! Great options all around.",

I waited tables and bar tended for years so i have patience and understand how demanding people can be when they have separate checks and want to get in and out , it can be quite frustrating. However we have a reservation for 10 it took 15 mins for them to seat us ( table was ready it wasn't that busy) it took another 20 Minutes to get waters . I said to the server \"feel free to take our orders whenever \" her response \"you'll have to wait a minute\" .. ok fine maybe she's busy .. 15 mins later she asks if we know what we want, by this time everyone has to order there food to go. She could have cared less she didn't even seem busy she was puttering around leaving a cake at a table she had already served and filling water. What could have made her money probably only made her $2 a person and i have never left less than $5 on anything no matter how small. I won't leave her name but her attitude sucked and i hope she's a little more in her game if she ever works a night shift. By cold food was sub par by the time i got back to the office. That's 15 people that won't me back and i used to really like that place . Oh well there are many more choices in the area.",

    "text": "Cantina, pull it together. I was super excited to try the new Park Road location and even more excited that they were opening for weekend brunch, but this experience was one miss after another. I'm hoping it's just because they're in a new location and trying to get acclimated, but...  We got there on a Sunday at 9:00 am when they open, and I wasn't sure we'd walked in the correct door because there was a ladder in the lobby and numerous cardboard boxes, and construction workers were milling around. A guy walked up to me, and I asked if they were open; he said they were, gave us his name (but I still have no idea if was the owner, manager, etc.), and proceeded to take us on a tour of the new location. Call me cranky, but it's early on a Sunday morning, and I haven't had any coffee - just seat me and feed me! He let us pick where to sit, which some might appreciate, but I can't make decisions before coffee, and the new location is so huge, I felt overwhelmed. He also came over again mid-meal to tell the fella how they have TVs and the NFL Sunday Ticket in case he's into football or fantasy football.   Our waiter was super weird. He kept trying to pronounce the words on the menu in Spanish (being funny?), so he asked us how we liked the \"Mehican\" food and tried rolling his r's. It was awkward to say the least. He rarely made eye contact with us because he was watching the TV over our shoulder. He also never refilled our drinks, and when I finally asked about more coffee, he forgot. I waited and waited, and when I finally saw him again, he told me they were out of coffee and it was brewing. This was at 9:25 when they'd been open for 25 minutes, there were literally 4 people in the place, and one of them - the fella - wasn't even drinking coffee. The cup he finally brought me was so bad I couldn't even drink it. Thankfully the waitress for other couple saw that we were out of water and refilled that.  Onto the food... I got the Mexican Lager Pancakes with bananas, scrambled eggs, and bacon. The bacon was way spicier than I'd planned on, but the pancakes were good. The banana slices come in the batter (much like they do other places), but our waiter made a scene out of yelling to the kitchen staff that there were no bananas, and then he made me cut into my pancakes to prove that they were in there. For. The. Love. The fella got the Chorizo Burrito, which was deliciousy cheesy. Oddly enough, our waiter brought chips and salsa to our table... at 9:00 a.m.  Alllll that said, the new location is bright and spacious, and I'm glad for the ample parking. I'll try again, but not for a loooong time til I let you guys try it out and give me the \"all clear\" to go back.",

Having eaten at this location another time and experienced bad service I was not particularly excited, but hey, how can a margarita and some nachos go wrong?    We were promptly seated and a server came to take our order.  He disappeared, we assumed to enter our drink and nacho orders.  We were very shortly visited by another server who offered to take our order.  We explained our orders had been given.  The young lady said he was in training, and she disappeared as well.  We waited a bit, and we were served chips and salsa.  The bartender noticed that a nearby table had not been served and he asked them about their order.   The table explained that we were there first and to take our order.  The bartender took our order AGAIN.   Another 10 minute wait.  I believe another server came over to ask about our order.  Finally we received our drinks and had to ask again for our nachos.  Yet another server came over and explained they were \"short staffed\" which was odd because over all we had at least 7 different people come over to either take our order, ask about it, or apologize.    Finally we received our nachos and additional chips and salsa.  A person told us they were very sorry for the confusion and comped the nachos, which was very nice.  This restaurant has been open for years and should operate more smoothly than this, particularly with all the other FS restaurants in Charlotte.    I hear John Hancock's shiel/spiel about this restaurant, but he must live in an alternate universe.",

    "text": "If you're looking for great tasting Mexican-style food beyond the traditional favorites, Cantina 1511 is the place!  Most of their entrees are based on traditional Mexican dishes rather than the \"Americanized Mexican\" food found at most restaurants.   If you get nothing else, a must-have is their Five Cheese Queso Fundido. It will change your perspective on \"cheese dip.\"  The  mix of 5 cheeses - some imported from Mexico - along with the caramelized onions and mild smoky poblano peppers in the dip really takes it to another level. Served with fresh warm nachos, it makes for a fantastic start to your meal.  My two favorite entrees are the Carne Azteca - marinated Flank Steak with garlic lime papas bravas, avocado tomatillo salsa and grilled red onion confit. Then there's the Slow-Cooked Short Rib In Negra Modelo - a tender short rib slow-cooked in Mexican Vienna lager with portobello mushrooms, white onions and arbol chiles on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and a side of white beans. It will knock your socks off!    On our last trip, my wife got a Ground Beef Burrito. This thing was the size of a shoe and was stuffed with seasoned gound beef, charro beans, vegetable rice and topped with both Ranchero sauce and queso sauce. It was served with guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo and a lettuce and tortilla slaw. This ain't Taco Bell, folks.  The next time you crave honest, delicious Mexican, get your fix at Cantina 1511.  You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I am very glad I do not live in the Dilworth area because I would be in Cantina 1511 nearly every afternoon. It is common knowledge amongst my closest friends and family that I hold a dear place in my heart for Mexican cuisine. I feel it is often underrated and under appreciated so I am a bit biased but I truly believe Cantina 1511 is one of the most delicious restaurants I have ever been.   Whether going for a birthday dinner or after a long day at work, Cantina hits the spot. They have delicious drinks, my favorite is the mojito, at great prices. The appetizers are amazing. I prefer the queso with jalapeno bacon. The menu suits all tastes and is divided into \"authentic\" and \"tex-mex\".  Literally everything on the menu is delicious but I would suggest sticking to the \"authentic\" side for something a little different. My only word of caution is to either make a reservation or go prepared to wait because there is ALWAYS a wait!",

I was also impressed when the waiter told us the pinto beans had pork in it and replaced it with black beans. As much as I would like to give this place a 4-star rating, I can't because we were not told there was a \"sharing\" tax!! I have never heard of place that charges you extra if you share your entree with someone, so much for curbing portion control when restaurants offer a entree that could feed a family of 5 now a days. I was not thrilled with the hidden charge until we received our bill.  If you want modern Mexican I would suggest Vida in downtown, they have yummy food and there is NO share charge!",

The fish is fried crispy and the chipotle sauce gives it some nice flavor. Their margaritas are pretty nice as well. They are a little on the weak side but they taste great. The restaurant decor is fun and funky. The music is loud enough to feel fun but not too loud to have a conversation. The service has always been excellent, even on busy nights.",

The taco, which normally has a crispy shell, was thrown into the enchilada sauce.  The person bringing us our order did not check to ensure order accuracy.  I was upset about the taco being soggy and gross, and went on to the enchilada, and it was chicken instead of beef.  Two strikes in one menu item.  The family got chimichangas, which were alright but were also sitting in a thick puddle of water.    Their to go boxes are those that you would recieve an elementary school lunch in- styrofoam with segments.  The beans were thrown into one segment and the rice into another, allowing for cross contamination.  I'm pretty sure the beans should be in a separate container, at the very least.  Bottom line, don't order takeout from here.  They don't take the time to ensure order accuracy, and they are not equipped with the proper boxes to handle takeout to begin with.",

Their service has gone way down, and even worse than that the food and margaritas aren't good anymore. The house mix has gotten way too sweet and the drinks aren't consistent. You can order the same drink twice and each drink tastes different and could come in a different glass.  The food use to be good. Marco Polo was a big favorite of mine. The last two times I had this dish it was not good. The shrimp was rubbery and tasted gooey ... Not good.  I spoke with the floor manager last time but he just brushed off my comments and said, \"we haven't changed anything.\"  I won't be back.",

Even though I should have know better by now that most of \"authentic\" Mexican food in Charlotte has not been good or authentic. I ordered the enchiladas Tejanos because the description sounded good. However, the best part of the meal were the beans. The \"oaxaca' cheese tasted nothing like real oaxaca but reminded me of gooey monterrey jack. I have never tasted barbacoa that is these sweet. In my opinion, Chipotle's barbacoa is more authentic. I just can not like the flavors that I've found in the so called Mexican food joints around here. I will stick to the few hole-in-the-wall spots for my Mexican food.",

We had no reservations with a party of 10 people. we waited for about 20 minutes and they sat us which was pretty good considering it was a busy friday night. Our waitress was very friendly and overall the service was good. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was enough to fill me up with a piece or two remaining. My husband ordered three tacos which were the fish of the day \"grouper\", some pork, and beef.  He was very happy with his tacos until he bit into the grouper. He said it was too fishy for him. Thinking to myself it can't be THAT bad, I took a bite into his fish taco and man was it BAD. It was so fishy that I had to spit it back out into a napkin. Our other friend had ordered the same fish taco so we watched him take a bite into his before telling him how bad it was (just to see if it was just our taste buds lol). He took a bite into it and his face just said it all. He hated it as well. We told our waitress and they gladly took off the 2 fish tacos off our tab and the manager came to apologize as well.   Overall experience was good and we will be back :)   P.S the dragon berry mojito is soooo yummy! I had two :)",

Thought we were doing well to have reservations, but due to large party had to wait well over 30 minutes past the reservation time. Also the restaurant cancelled reservation so we did not earn points for visit. Very strange and no explanation as to why??? The server was not as attentive as we hoped,yet was pleasant and  knew menu well,plus  made nice recommendations.  Prices were a tad bit higher than quality. Food was not bad just nothing special. May return, just not weekend evening. Management really needed to do a better job with staff availability and booking large parties. Wait times without quasi reservation were 60-120 minutes.

Queso was disgusting, Qdoba across the street has better  food overall  -entrees arrived after an hour of being seated.

    "text": "To preface, I have been an OTB fan for several years, much to the dismay of my more foodie-type friends.  To quote one of my buddies \"OTB is gross.  But ohhhhh, Cantinaaaaa!\"  So!  As a Charlottean who is looking to eat \"outside of the box\" and experience the dining the QC has to offer, I grabbed my sister and decided to give it a whirl.  After reading the fair reviews from fellow yelpers, I decided that we should do a late-lunch at Cantina on a Saturday, avoid the whole dinner crowd, and need for reservations.  We get to Cantina around 3pm.  We walk in, and were immediately seated.  I didn't think this was a surprise given the timeframe -- but as I stared to look around, I realize this place is PACKED.  3pm on a Saturday, and it was raining!  Good sign.  Our waiter was slammed (from what I could tell, he had the \"oh crap, its 3pm and we're packed and I have to serve 8 tables\" shift), but he was very prompt, helpful, and polite.  I told him it was our first time at Cantina, and asked for his suggestion on drinks and food.    Both of us ordered the Twiggy (which is a \"skinny\" version of the traditional margarita, with added orange juice) I thought it was refreshing, but my sister thought it tasted too much like a Tequila Sunrise.  Whoopsie from us #1 - she couldn't stomach it (and if I finished it I probably couldn't drive) so she asked for it to be sent back to the bar for a less-traditional frozen marg.  Our waiter complied with a smile, and she loved her new drink.  We also ordered the Queso Fundido, which was incredibly CHEESY (well, duh I guess).  I've never had the pleasure of goat cheese in my queso before, but it made it creamier and very different from queso at other establishments.  Very fresh.  Our waiter recommended my entree selection:  Enchilada Suizas.  He said if I didn't like it, he would immediately bring out the selection I had requested.  I'm a trusting person, so I went with Waiter's Choice.  Whoopsie from us #2 - I didn't like it.  Not sure if it was the tomatillo or verde sauce, but it just wasn't my favorite.  Again, service with a smile and he brought out my Enchilada Tradicionales.  Much better.  Not quite as rich.    So!  Waiter at Cantina -- thank you so much for your patience and willingness to make sure we had an excellent dining experience.  I hope you liked your ginormous tip.  Guest service as a whole was spot-on, the food was fresh, the tequila was plentiful, and I hope to come again.",

We actually ended up getting an assortment of plates and apps family style between four of us.  It worked out pretty well.  Their house fundido was amazing.  I don't even remember what was in it, but it was a great mix.  Got a couple of tacos and a quesadilla as well.  All in all, the food was tasty.

I also really liked their salsa and chips. it's a little pricey so bf and I split mixed fajitas. They were tasty, but I missed the beans and rice fajitas typically come with. We also got a side of the elote, which was underwhelming. Just needed a little more seasoning. It was well enough food for both of us to share, but this is not like a typical authentic mexican restaurant where you get way too much food for barely any money.   Katelyn was an excellent server!

    "text": "Did you know Cantina 1511 does brunch? Well, they do. And spoiler alert: it's pretty fantastic.  My friend Erin and I were starving after our Yelp Quirks Out event at Jazzercise Charlotte. Time for a boozy brunch! Hey, we earned it with that workout, right? We tried to hit Sir Ed's, but they didn't open until 5pm. Fail. So, we wandered across the parking lot to Cantina 1511.  I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, so it was a no brainer for my drink order. They use a serrano and cilantro infused Finlandia vodka for this one. Win. We weren't sure what to get. Here's what I love: the waiter completely jumped in and was honest. He told me to ax my original order and gave us his ranking for the brunch dishes. Erin went with his #2 pick: the avocado bake. I went with the #3 pick: the fajita style shrimp and grits. He nailed it with both of those dishes. They were delicious. And in case you were wondering, his number one seed is the arepas benedict.  I wasn't sure how I would feel about this new location, but I like that there seems to be more parking. Yes, the shopping center area here can get crazy, but the lot can handle all of it.   Cantina has great salsa. The tableside made guac is a must get. The tortilla soup is solid. I think I order something different every time I come here. It's all pretty good.   This place can handle a group pretty well. I've been here for a couple different birthdays and girls night type events. They do take reservations. You can also place orders online for pickup.",

    "text": "\"Bring more to the table than good food\" is what Cantina 1511 promises on to do through their dining and culinary experience. However, our evening experience bodes far from their promise. While the food itself fit the reputation, the service was far from the 4 star rating they managed to squeeze out of the internet. The waiter was something of a ghost during our experience as he failed to check in on us or offer any improvements to our meal. When one of the guests in our party accidentally spilled her water, we were left to clean up the large mess with only a few napkins. Waiters stood by as we struggled and did not offer any assistance. One of the few times that he checked on us, he was replenishing one of the guests' water glasses but poured far too much and caused it to overflow, spilling water all over the guest. He also caused a sharp knife to drop due to his clumsiness, nearly hitting one of our guests' feet and causing great distress in our party. At the end of our meal we received our checks only to find that the waiter had significantly mishandled the bills, after we specifically asked him to place our appetizers on one bill. This left our entire party unhappy as we all paid more. We clearly expressed our discontent with his mistake, however he did not offer to fix it or extend an apology.",

    "text": "Just left here. As another review stated it was a Friday night, but place was half empty and service was slow. Our server was super sweet, but I could tell English was his second language so there was a language barrier. I had two hungry kiddos with me so ordered a cheese quesadilla & chicken tenders for them, but being their menu is quite expansive I kept mine to go over it. The server came back three times within maybe 5-7 minutes asking if I was ready to order (I overlooked this because I was attending to the kids so he probably figured I was ready since I wasn't looking at the menu.) I told him I needed more time twice, but by the third time I just asked what was popular as I saw they were getting busier and wanted to order quickly. He just stated tacos, fajitas, quesadillas. I was hoping for more descriptive suggestions as there are many options for all those choices, but I went with the chicken quesadilla to stay on the safe side. Food came out quickly. Kiddos enjoyed their food, but my chicken quesadilla was bland, kind of cold and flavorless. Though he was very attentive at first that slacked once I ordered, he didn't even ask how our food was. I had to yell for his attention when he was at other tables. First time I asked him if they seasoned the chicken, he seemed as though he didn't understand my question so I then just asked for salt, pepper and hot salsa thinking maybe that will help, it didn't. I only ate one quesadilla piece. Though I was starving I couldn't force myself to eat the rest. I just munched on the chips and salsa that came out at first and the guacamole and pico that came with quesadilla (guac could use salt).  I had to get his attention again to get the menu again to look at desserts,  then again to order the desserts, then again to get my check. He asked if I wanted a box for the quesadilla, I said no stating I still didn't like it, he didn't apologize or anything just picked up the plates then maybe 10/15 mins later finally brought out the check. The quesadilla was charged which I wouldn't had minded had he been more apologetic or accommodating, maybe offering me something else. I didn't make a big deal out of it as I had two antsy and now tired kids with me. Ended up going to shake shack for a burger. Won't be back.",

    "text": "This was my first time coming to this establishment. I was traveling to North Carolina for work and there was nothing by my hotel except fast food. I saw a mix of reviews on yelp which made me hesitant to come here. Honestly the deciding factor was they participate in the Upromise program. I was seated immediately and it was not all that busy. I sat for maybe 90 seconds before my waiter came to check on me and asked if I had been waiting long. The ambiance is nice, I couldn't tell if the chairs were deliberately scuffed up to look more like an authentic Mexican restaurant or if they were just old. The complimentary chips and salsa were pretty good. Not sure if the chips were homemade or not, they were hot when they came out. But they could have just been heated. Salsa was decent, not overpowering flavors, fairly subtle. I told the waiter I wanted to try a margarita and asked his opinion, he suggested 2 of his favs, I got the los 1511. It was good, it tasted like it was freshly made and not store bought mix. The waiter came back and asked me about my food order and explained he was leaving but a new waitress was taking over. Again I asked the waiters suggestions, he told me his 3 favorites, I went with one of his suggestions and got the Mexican Barbacoa. I was going to town on the chips and salsa and felt like my meal came out in 6 or 7 mins, very fast. The presentation was great, I should have said no guacamole, but everything was good. It came with soft shell tortillas so you could create your own burrito/taco. The pork tasted really fresh, maybe it could have had more seasoning for flavor. But when combining with the beans, rice, cheese and lettuce. It worked well together. The food was all good, not great but good. I tend to be tough to impress. The service was 4 star, the food was 3. If you could, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars but I can't say my food was 4 stars so I had to give my visit 3. But if I'm back in the area I would certainly come back.",

I saw my food waiting in the window long before that! The server said they had to run other food before mine could be run. As he was bringing my food 30 minutes after my order, I told him to pack it up. I got no apology, I had to pay for my food which over $20 dollars and cold by the time it came to the table. They were not rushed and there seems to be no reason for such a bad experience. I won't be back!",

BORING!! And yes, good tequlia is smooth, especially w/the right mixers, but this was just flat in so many ways. I had the soft chicken taco lunch w/beans only, however they put abt 1 tablespoon of slaw on my plate. The meat was dry and tasted like a dirty grill, the drizzeled sauce was some horrible sweet mayo concoction. Not my favorite.",

    "text": "Before I discovered Cantina 1511, I couldn't find any really good Mexican restaurants in Charlotte.  Sure, I'd found some that were average where you could get your basic Mexican \"fixins.\"  But it wasn't until I dined at Cantina that I said, \"Yep, that's the one!\"  Cantina isn't your traditional Mexican restaurant; it's more of an upscale/gourmet Mexican restaurant, but not at all pretentious.  The atmosphere is very jovial, lively, and casual.  I have yet to have a poor experience...for lunch, dinner, or even brunch!    To start, they bring chips and two types of salsa (one red, one green, both delicious) to your table.  And if you're really daring and love it spicy, ask your server for the extra hot version!  Of course, everyone knows that by the time your main Mexican entree comes, you're already filled up on the chips and salsa; however, don't let that stop you from ordering the freshly made guacamole to go with the chips and salsa.  It's a little on the high-end pricewise, but it's well worth it.  They make the guac right at your table so you get to see all the fresh ingredients going into it.  Then once you take a bite...WOW.  You'll want to order it all the time.  It truly is the best guacamole I've ever tasted.  (Even better than the real authentic stuff in Mexico -- shhhh!)    As for the entrees, I've tried a variety of items, but I keep going back to (1) the Enchiladas de Dennis (spinach, chicken, and cheese) and (2) the taco combination platter where you can pick one, two, or three tacos.  The shrimp and tilapia tacos are out of this world.    And don't forget the drinks!  Both the mango margarita and white sangria leave me wanting more.    One of my favorite afternoons was when three of us got out of work early for the day and went to Cantina for lunch.  It was the perfect spring day:  sun shining, temperature just right, and birds chirping.  We sat outside at Cantina to enjoy the beautiful weather, drank margaritas, and had a delicious lunch.  It doesn't get any better than that!",

    "text": "We met some friends for dinner there last night. The hostess was very accomodating and said that she could go ahead and seat us but we decided to wait for our other friends to arrive so we stopped by the bar.  The bartender was a little distracted, &  I didn't have a chance to order a beverage before our friends arrived.  But, no matter since we were seated immediately anyway.    I would have to give our server 3 stars for service.  Maybe we just caught him on a bad night, but he was not attentive about our drinks and did not seem overly helpful when we had questions about specific items on the menu.    Also, one member of our party asked if she could have onions left off a taco and he said absolutely not.  I know  that a lot of chef's are \"offended\" when patrons ask for changes to a dish, but it sort of leaves a bad taste in my mouth when restuarants are not willing to entertain any kind of special request.  After all, a place like this you would expect the food to be cooked to order...  so if someone wants their taco without onions, it should not present a huge problem.   While there were a couple of stand-out  items, overall, I would have to rate the food just 3 stars for this visit.   Of course, we started the evening with house-made tortilla chips served with a side of pickled veggies and fresh salsa.   We also placed an order for Queso Fundido (imported Mexican cheeses melted with fresh herbs and chilies - $5 for a small, $7 for a large).  Without question, that is the best queso I have ever eaten. 5 stars for this dish alone - I would go back anytime just for that!  The queso fundido is served with a side of soft flour tortillas- which was perfect with a little of the vegetable mixture and a big scoop of queso. Yummo!   I decided to order off the Authentic Mexican menu rather than the TexMex menu.  There were several items I really wanted to try, but our waiter said the Tacos Dorados were his favorite, so I decided to go with that.  The Tacos Dorados are described as \"Crispy shrimp, crab and scallion tacos. Topped with Mexican crema, cabbage, and Valentina hot sauce. Served with Mexican vegetable rice and black beans D-$12\".    First off, the mexican vegetable rice & black beans were absolutely DELICIOUS. I am a huge fan of black beans and theirs were seasoned perfectly.    However, sadly I was less thrilled with the actual main dish.  The taco shells were fabulous - obviously freshly made in house and appeared to be deep fried after the shrimp & crab mixture was put in.  The shrimp-crab mix had a pretty good flavor but was a bit on the dry side.  The real problem for me was that the Mexican Crema and Valentina Hot Sauce was Missing In Action - there was a little on top of the entree but not enough to enjoy on each taco.  I think the dish would have greatly been improved if these 2 elements were more abundant. The mixture on the inside seemed to lack any cheese, so the crema was really needed to give it that extra flavor and texture.  I also like things on the spicy side and it seems our chef either forgot the spicy sauce or thought we couldn't handle it - so I had to use the salsa that came with our chips along with the stuff out of the bottle to give it a little kick.   One of my friends ordered the Cantina Chimichanga (described as a Crispy burrito filled with a choice of chicken or steak, black beans, pico de gallo, Mexican vegetable rice and mixed cheeses. Topped with Ranchero and Chile con queso sauce. Choice of grilled vegetables or rice and beans $12).  This turned out to be a gigantic burrito! Better bring your appetite if you're planning to order this one (or you'll have one big doggy bag!)    But, all-in-all, I would like to go back and try some of the other menu items...and I will definitely go back just for that fabulous Queso!!",

    "text": "If you have ONE thing here, make it the table-side guac! The tortilla soup is delicious (especially on a cold day), so after all those guac and chips, I like to have the soup for my dinner. If you like shrimp, the Marco Polo tacos are really great. Oh, and even if you don't get the guac, the salsa is tasty and the chips are warm, crispy, and unlimited. If you go on a Tuesday night, it's kids' night, so if that's not your scene, ask to be seated in the high top table section--the kiddos are usually on the other side. Outdoor seating is nice, too, when the weather is good. The food at the Rea Road location (Stonecrest Shopping Center) is just as awesome, but the atmosphere is a little more upscale. You can't go wrong at either location.",

I was very frustrated at that point, but would like to say that as soon as I wrote that review, not even a whole day later, one of the managers messaged me on here and apologized, wished my friend a belated birthday and gave me his personal email. He told me to email him whenever my friend and I would like to come in and he would take care of us!!! I dont make it to Charlotte as often as I like and I often forget about my yelp reviews so I just wanted to put this out there while I was thinking about it. That, to me, is great customer service and something so many businesses lack these days!!! I will definitely not hesitate to return the next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "When I first moved to Charlotte, my husband and I went to Cantina during its off-peak hours. When we went in and got seated we noticed it had an unusual and unpleasant odor. After sitting for just a couple minutes we decided to leave. A few months have gone past and after multiple people told us they like Cantina 1511, we thought we'd give it another chance.  We went for dinner and it was a popular place! I could still smell a slight odor (like a mildew rag), but it seemed to be overpowered by the smells of sauteed onions and grilled meats. Perhaps I was more sensitive to it because of our prior experience. I'm sure the majority of their patrons do not notice.   The service was great! Their staff was very friendly. The food was pretty good. I love chips and salsa and I was happy with theirs; they bring out red and green salsa. I think I'm a tough critic when it comes to Mexican or Tex Mex because I lived in Arizona and Texas the majority of my life...the Southwest is difficult to beat when it comes to Mexican food. Overall, the food was good and the service was great.",

Bartender was friendly, service was very fast.  Only complaint is the trashy guy next to us at the bar. The poor chick with him, at one point he says I bet not one woman in this place doesn't want to sleep w/m.  Me and his date both raised our hands.  Hahaa NC trash.    Apps: Great chips and salsa,  Spicy! Chicken tortilla soup -was fantastic!   Main: I had some kind of pulled pork plate, it was OK nothing I would ever order again -the pork was overcooked/burnt.  I asked the bartender what he liked and he said he had been working there so long he no longer ate there...? Not sure if that was a good or bad comment. He told me my dish was one of the most popular on the menu -but didn't directly say it was good. Being a former server/bartender I'm a little sad that this guy couldn't ball up and tell me if was the most popular dish but it sucked.  Other Main: Chicken fajitas -they looked awesome, huge portion, his only complaint was that he was not given enough tortillas   Drinks: Top Shelf Margs! Awesome. Great quality tequilla  Location: Near Uptown NC   All in all I was extremely full and felt weighted down when I left. But maybe that's the way you always feel after you stuff your face with chips, salsa, rice, beans, pork and margs.  Good spot if you are in the mood for Mexican.  Also 4-7pm they have a drink special at the bar!! Great deals.",

I tried 3 different tacos tonight and I couldn't even finish two of them, not to mention there was a random shrimp in one of them, which was an allergy hazard.

The boy and I showed up late Sunday afternoon for an early dinner/late lunch/super late breakfast and were quickly seated in the bar area.  The lighting was very dim - good if you want a romantic date, bad if you want to read the menu.    Anyways, we had a Living Social voucher to redeem so we ordered tons of food - starting with the table side guac.  The server brought us chips and salsa and was just about to show up with the guac when the power went out - twice.  Apparently the power went out and then their backup generator failed.    Turns out the power wasn't expected to be back on for a few hours so we enjoyed our guac by candlelight and were also serenaded by the waiter....  Our real meal never happened - obviously - no power, but I liked the way that they handled the unexpected situation and darn, now I have to go back!",

The Ancho Pollo chicken taco wasn't too shabby either.  The taco comes with one side, I like the rice and black beans which comes in a small cup.  For libations, I ordered the Orange Tijuana Taxi, yes, yes and yes to this cocktail!

We got the fish/seafood combination, which was three courses of seafood... the first was fried appetizers of shrimp, whitefish, zucchini, and calamari with delicious dipping sauces.  The second course was a paella with mussels, scallops, fish and shrimp, and dessert was a delicious tres leches cake.  WOW.  Everything was superb.

    "text": "- This place is average. Not as great as people make it seem. We went on a Friday night and we expected it to be packed but it wasn't so we were happy because we had forgotten to make reservations. The inside is beautiful and it's definitely a great place to go have drinks and socialize with friends. But as soon as they sat us down, that's when it all went downhill. Our server was horrible! He took our drink order and after bringing us our drinks, he then took our food order. Little did we know, we were not gonna see him again. Waited 15mins, there was no sign of him. We needed a refill with our drinks and we needed refills on the chips and salsa. Where did our server go? Who knows. We waited patiently another 5 mins, and didn't understand where he went because it was not even a busy night at all. After waiting a total of 20mins, my friend for whom we were taking out to celebrate her birthday got up, walked up to another server and asked her to come refill our drinks and to bring the manager as well. When the manager arrived, he was very professional about the whole situation and apologized for our server, and gave us a discount which we were not expecting at all. I don't remember the name of the manager but he was tall, brown hair and had glasses. Only thing that bothered us was that even though we had already spoken to the manager, our servers attitude did not change. He continued to do his own thing, refilled our drinks one time again after we got our food and didn't come back to the table until it was time to give us the bill. But get this, the whole time that he didn't come to our table, we definitely saw him going to his other tables, which I thought was very rude. He walked right passed us and couldn't even ask if we needed anything or see if things were okay. Service definitely needs improvement!  Now onto our meals, it was good but not spectacular. I was expecting a lot more from this place since there was a few good reviews about it on yelp. Don't expect authentic food, this is more American tex-mex. As for the prices of meals, they were more on the pricier side. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying $20 for an entree but if it's just some tacos on a plate that taste like any other place I don't think it's worth it. I won't say I'll never come back, cause I will. Every place deserves a second chance but the second time will be for drinks and tapas.   So because of the way the manager handled the situation in a well mannered way, I give this place a 2 star.",

The new location is not as intimate as the East Blvd location (the only reason this is not a 5 star rating) but they are able to accommodate more customers, so the trade-off for me is worth it.  I have never been disappointed with the meals or the service and the guacamole is consistently outstanding!  One time our server even stopped in the middle of the table-side guacamole prep and said he could not finish since the avocados he selected were not perfectly ripe.  He promptly returned with new avocados and delivered perfection in a bowl that was spiced exactly to our taste.  Very impressive!  The predominant style is indeed Tex-Mex which is my favorite but I understand it may not suit everyone.  That said there are a few \"authentic Mexican\" dishes that my wife gravitates toward and she is as big a fan of Cantina 1511 as I am.  Enjoy, but plan to get there early on Friday evening if you want to be seated quickly.",

    "text": "Interesting concept. I was genuinely impressed by this place. I ordered the lunch steak quesadillas and they were pretty good.   What stood out from me was the level of service by our waitress. She knew just about everything i asked her and she was very attentive to my needs. 5 stars for her.   My 1511 margarita with herradura tequila was average at best. It was way too sour for my taste.   This place is much more expensive than most mexican restaurants. $17 for steak fajitas seems a little overkill for me. Overall though not a bad place.",

And she said no, \"but we have jalapenos\"... We should have known better and left.  We both ordered fajitas... And for $17 per person... It was a pretty sad entree.  Plus no rice or beans or sides for that price?  Disappointing.  Decent margaritas though.",

You know when you are trying to decide where can you go and sit outside on a beautiful day, this is that place, however, sometimes service and margaritas can be spotty.  Their chips tonight were better than usual they were lighter than my last visit, big improvment, very crispalicious.   Our server was slack.  Anybody that says they don't like a snooty waiter, I always say, I would rather have an efficient surly waiter anyday than a nice slack ass.  It was the typical horror story of slow on giving the menus, slow on taking the orders, not giving us flatware, having to ask the food runner for flatware. I gave her cash as soon as she came around because I knew getting the check was going to take some time.   About the margaritas, one day, there was fresh squeezed juice on the bar and the bartender made a margarita with it, I have been back a couple of times to get that same margarita, but what I get is a simple syrup almost clear margarita.  Not the same juice mixture of that day.    I am not completly going to write off Cantina, I like their food, I am going to restrict my hours of going there from 11a-5p.  I will find that margarita again.    About the food, I always get the same thing, one Al Pastor taco with rice and beans.",

Its hard to  bring something new to the conversation that hasnt already been mentioned...  Highlights: *The chips and salsa are simply amazing. *I usually get the Carne Asada Burrito, the dinner portion is $12 and is worth every last dime.  Here's a little hint, you can get the burritos topped with BOTH queso and ranchero sauce!!  How can you go wrong?!?!  The burrito is probably a little \"fatter\" than what you would think (see pics) but thats only because it is stuffed with tasty, Mexican goodness! *The table-side Guac is simply real.  Its made at your time and you BETTER ask for it a spicy!  I usually always get the side of guac for $2 if I choose not to go with the full-out appetizer.   *Service is ALWAYS excellent.  Never has my meal been anything other than what I ordered.  I have never had to wait an abnormal amount of time for my meal to arrive once I ordered.  Drinks are always promptly refilled.  Staff is always friendly and polite.    *Parking is hit or miss honestly.  If you go there during peak hours - Friday @8pm, parking can definitely be tight.  But usually, there is ample space is the lot directly behind the building.   *I love that they have Dos Equis Amber on draft all day, every day!  Lowlights: NONE  Great, upscale Mexican food and dining experience, but with reasonable prices.  Cantina leads all competition - La Paz, Vida Cantina (at the epicenter), and Zapatas, when it comes fabulous Mexican food in Charlotte.",

Ordered a chicken and jalapeno bacon quesadilla which came to me with not one drop of bacon. The server tried to tell me that the bacon is small...it was actually non existent. She then commented that the cook was new and that she would ask someone to talk to him because he didn't speak English...which i Thought was a strange and unnecessary information to tell a customer. She then offered to bring me out a side of bacon so I could put my quesadilla together properly on my own. Pretty dismal. The margaritas were also just average or a bit below. My friend got a quesadilla with crab and avocado and it was manly cheese and a couple bits of crab meat in one or 2 pieces of the quesadilla. Even though this is literally like a mile from my house it will probably be one of my last choices for dining out due to the service and poor food quality.",

    "text": "I went for brunch last Sunday - after seeing the wait over at the Flying Biscuit - I am SOOO glad we did!  This was our first visit to their new location. At first, we weren't sure they were open, even though Yelp said they would be - there were few cars and no one visible from just outside the door. We went in anyway and there were only 2 parties in the joint. After just a moment, someone came to the front and seated us in our own section. I was not expecting the 5-star experience we had after that initial feeling of \"should we do this?\"  I didn't see any booths and the place has an open layout - so I can imagine it being noisy as other posters have stated....but at breakfast, it was nice and quiet.... once lunch time started in earnest toward the end of our visit, the kid-noise-level increased. (note - it is never acceptable to allow your child to run around a restaurant screaming.)  It was nearly 10:30, so the server said we could choose either brunch or lunch - and when I indicated brunch - he walked me through some of the specialities on the menu with such passion, I wanted to order everything. I have to go back to try  2 of the recommendations - but this first time, I really wanted Huevos Rancheros. We were given a bowl of chips and salsa and our coffees. Odd mix, but in the spirit of being at a Mexican restaurant on a Sunday morning, it worked.   I loved the huevos rancheros and will have to struggle very hard to order something else on my next visit. If you're not familiar with the dish - it is basically 2 eggs over a quesadilla with black beans. Sounds plain - but chefs will create all sorts of rifs on the sauce, the cheese, the other add-ins, and 1511 does it perfectly. The ranchero sauce was delicious, the black beans were perfectly done.  I can't wait to go back and try the Avocado Bake! And the benedict. If you and I are friends and you want to go one weekend, just let me know!",

Then when the food showed up half of us at part of it because it took and hour to get our food and it mostly undercooked or ice cold. And then having time separate a bill by three couples like we asked was a major challenge. All for all horrible food, horrible service and way over priced for the serving size. There are way to many restaurants in South Park and nice Mexican places that serve proper and food temp. And anyone with any pride would never walk out with ice cold food an serve it",

However, the manager walked the bar 3 times and didn't even ask if we needed drinks or wanted to order. Nothing! It's a joke.   This chips are always stale and the service ALWAYS STINKS!  Great location, great job on the up-fitting of the building but not ever stepping foot in this place.  Every time I give them another shot I'm disappointed!   Big let down.  Wish they were back on east when Eric worked the bar and Patrick was the manager. I went there like 3 times a week and ALways had excellent service regardless of how busy they were!",

    "text": "I was expecting to be a little more blown away by Cantina especially since its one of Charlotte's more established Mexican restaurants but I found it be all right.  I joined my friend for some margaritas on a Saturday evening (the place wasn't busy at all at 5:30ish). We started with the complimentary chips and salsa - both excellent! nice crunchy, slightly salty chips and salsa with a little bit of a kick, just the way I like it! We also decided to go for the tableside guac - nice and chunky but could've used a tad more salt/lime.   I decided to go with the Pina (pineapple) margarita and my friend had the strawberry. Both deliciously strong!! I went with the two taco combo: fish & pork tacos. I was slightly disappointed in their refried beans and rice. Neither were particularly indicative of traditional Mexican beans and rice and the portion was teeny tiny!   I don't know if I'll be rushing to go back as I can always count on my trusty Paco's to make an even better marg and taco but I won't count out Cantina",

She wasn't rude but wasn't attentive either. We had to ask a waiter passing by for drink refills, place settings, and chips and salsa. I have a feeling our waitress also lied to us about our order because 20min after we ordered, she came to our table and said \"some girl\" spilled water all over our food and that she had to resubmit our order. But then proceeded to ask for our order again.   When our food finally came out another 15mins later, the food was cold. Besides being cold, the food was also subpar. I ordered Baja fish tacos & carne asada taco which were very bland.   I would give it another shot if this first impression wasn't as bad as it was. :(",

    "text": "Came in as a small group of three on a Friday night. We were seated promptly as the restaurant was rapidly filling up.  The dining area is large, separated by walls and sliding doors in certain areas. Tables are close together which causes a loud environment, not the place for extremely private or intimate conversation. Unfortunately our table was right by the silverware steam cleaner and computer for all of the staff to put in orders/obtain checks, etc. There was constant traffic by our table and it grew increasingly warmer as the steamer kept being opened and closed.   The dining room seemed clean, however, the same cannot be said for the women's restroom. I am understanding of the fact that on a Friday night there is a constant flow of patrons, my suggestion is to ensure you have a staff member assessing the conditions often. Restrooms represent you and the quality of the visit just as much as everything else, especially if it has everyone in there cringing.   Our waitress was (semi) friendly at times, distracted at others, and slow moving for the majority. Once she got the idea that you were finishing your final sentence she would walk off as you completed it. Refills on drinks and chips were slow, and we never got refills on salsa...maybe I missed the fact that refills of salsa weren't a possibility? I will say the salsa had great flavor and a nice kick and the chips were warm.   They have some vegetarian options for food (all include mushroom as the main ingredient) as well as GF options (corn tortillas). I had the enchilada verde, my boyfriend the steak and chicken fajitas, and my sister the BBQ 1511 platter. I think the flavors of my dish were inventive and worked well together. I don't think it was out of this world, but I enjoyed it as an average dish with slight questions about the freshness of ingredients. My boyfriend also felt unimpressed about his dish, but my sister enjoyed hers as unique and flavorful.   The drink menu is plentiful, fun, and covers every aspect of alcohol possible. But sadly the margaritas (I had the El Dorado) seemed slightly weak. There is a nice patio if you enjoy outdoor dining.   Overall this is a slightly overpriced establishment. The pricing is not reflective on the way you receive service, the environment, or quality of dishes. If in the future all of the listed qualities bump up a notch, it wouldn't seem overpriced anymore. Overall there were positives and negatives but we still had an enjoyable evening.",

    "text": "06/21/10  I don't mind dining at a chain, as long as I (and others who may have joined me) leave feeling terrific about the experience.  Our party of four (three adults and a child) decided we'd try this place out, partly bec. of the glowing write-up it received in Charlotte magazine.  I was also excited about trying Mexican French toast, as written about in Charlotte magazine's \"Top 50 Breakfasts!\"    As we entered the resto, we immediately noticed the comely decor of a typical modern Tex-Mex venue, and as we sat down, I especially noted that the music was very loud.  (If you'd like to experience this yourself, first take care to find a nice quiet spot- enjoy the silence for a few seconds, if you'd like- before you turn your speaker volume to full-blast, then head over to Cantina 1511's website.  I dare you to let this go on for another 90 minutes.  I DARE YOU!)  As our server delivered our drink orders, (sis and I also asked for the margarita special of the day, which was made w/ Heradura tequila), our server asked if we needed more time, to which I replied, \"I already know I'm having the Mexican toast,\" after which the others said they needed more time.  After the others had a few more minutes to look at the menu while listening to the loud background music, our server returned and took our orders- shrimp torta for Mom, steak fajitas for sis, and the French toast for me.  No French toast, except for Sunday brunch you say?  Well, I'll have the crab and avocado quesadilla, minus the avocado, then.  (And why the heck did you not mention this when I stated my intention before?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Maybe bec. you couldn't HEAR ME due to the crappy music that blared above us!!)  After a few minutes of trying to bat away a persistent fly, our chips and salsas arrived.  I took this time to ask the food presenter (not the server) to request if it was at all possible to lower the music's volume.  (Hey, it can't hurt to ask, right?)  The answer we received is that more than likely our request won't be granted, \"due to keeping up w/ the atmosphere, and all.\"  OK, well, would you please get rid of this pesty fly, then?\"  \"Haha, sorry, but no.\"  Looking back, we should've just stood up and left...  While I can't speak for the app myself due to a corn allergy, the general concensus was that it was A-OK.  The margarita, which sis at first turned her nose up to, was not bad after I stirred the beverage stick around a few times, which allowed the Heradura tequila and fresh juices to mix.  I'd asked if the drink could be made frozen, for future reference, but no.  (See a pattern here?)  As the tequila began to work its magic, sis noted that the music volume had come down a little.  Ole!  (However, the volume went back to its original strength a few minutes later.  Que mal!)  To make a \"mucho terrible\" story short, the food, w/ the exception of the fajitas and margarita, left us w/ much to desire.  Mom's shrimp torta was \"just another shrimp sandwich.\"  \"But what about the bolillo?,\" I asked.  \"Nothing special.\"  And this from a woman who LOVES the bolillos from our neighborhood grocery store!  Too bad, bec. the pics looked good, don't you agree?  (This seems like the case w/ the cuatro leches cake, as well, but I am getting ahead of myself.)  Nephew didn't even finish his taco, nor the fries (and how he loves fries!), and my crab quesadilla dish was just three charred triangles filled w/ too much cheese and lumps of crab here and there.  Despite my trimming off some of the cheese, I didn't even finish two!  We all pretty much concentrated on the steak fajitas, which, despite the fatty content of the meat, turned out pretty good.  (And thank goodness it did, for this pretty dish went for a pretty penny... 1600 pennies, to be exact!)    Hoping to end the meal w/ a postre (Spanish for dessert), I chose the Cuatro Leches cake, which promised four types of milk in the form of white chocolate meringue, dulce de leche crema (condensed and evaporated milks plus sugar) and the fourth?  I think there may have been white chocolate chunks, but don't quote me on it.  Two words: too sweet!  Take away the meringue topping, it's OK.  Nada especial!  Mom and sis didn't care for more than a bite, and bec. I didn't really have much to eat, I finished the dish anyway.  If you're going to try your luck w/ this dolce- skip the canned peach slices and ask for more stawberries!  Or, better yet, just pass on Cantina 1511 and look elsewhere.  Not only did I end up spending $70 on a lackluster meal, but I was in a foul mood for the rest of the day due to the blaring music, not to mention the disappointment in not having the Mexican toast (French toast w/ sweetened cream sauce).  Nowhere was it mentioned in the Charlotte magazine article, nor Cantina 1511's menu, that this selection is only available on Sundays.    Cantina 1511 is no bueno!",

My GF and I were dying for some frozen margaritas and 1511 came to mind..we don't go anywhere else, but their machine broken down a few weeks ago, so we waited till it got replaced.  We arrived very early on Friday and was seated outside and proceeded to order drinks...this time it was just going to be drinks.  So the first order arrives and my GF finds a tiny Ant in her drink...very easy to do as the drink itself it practically white.  My drink is okay..  The next rounds she finds ANOTHER SMALL Ant...we still don't say anything, but this time I search my drink and what do you know...I TOO have a small Ant in mine.  We tell the server, which takes the drink back and replaces it.  Just for giggles I search again in my new drink...another one shows up?  By now the server is frustrated and replaces the drink again.   The manager also comes out and apologized, but we tell them there must be a bunch that got into the machine when they got it.  The bartender asks the server if we have Ants on the table..........THAT FOLKS is the first warning signs of trouble for a customer....They aren't worried if we are upset...but whether we are making it up or trying to rip them off???????  Now we have 1 more round, plus I have another...we find one more Ant...a total of 7 drinks and 4 of those had Ants.  (a photo is included of one of the little rascals)  We aren't upset, just feel bad for the server and barstaff, but when the bill comes, only 2 drinks are written off????/  I mean really, you would have thought the top end mexican restaurant would have been all over this as it is a health code problem...but no, they just wrote off a sub set and sent us on our way.....hmmm....well off with 2 stars for that one.  Not that we wanted a free ticket, but I really felt like management dropped the ball.    Can you imagine for a moment if the guy from \"Hells Kitchen\" had been part of that event.....what hell he would have raised at the manager and servers....how much grief and swearing he would have done to those folks for acting they way they did...really, seriously...they need a wake up call..........OR......this is bigger problem than customers realize, hence the lack of concern?????????????  Hmmmm....something to think about when you are thinking about dining or drinking with these folks.",

We were given a semiprivate room behind the bar & had a really great experience. I hate that I don't remember our server's name, but he was uber responsive and managed a crowd of 15 like a champ. He kept our drinks and chip baskets full and the food came out quickly + all of the orders were correct!   You honestly can't go wrong with Cantina... the only reason I haven't been back since is I'm on the paleo diet and can't resist the temptation of chips at Mexican. Once I'm off the diet wagon again, I'll be back :)",

We were seated in the back section where Jamal and Chris were working together on the area. Both were amazing but we got to spend more time with Jamal and I have to say, I will be requesting him on our next visit.   Having been wanting a margarita, I talked the hubs into getting the trio that was on special. Jamal helped with this persuasion and picked out a perfect combo for him. Since I was not able to drink any myself, I was happy that he seemed to enjoy them.   We decided to split the fajitas for 2 and started with the salad. This was amazing. I was afraid I was going to be disappointed b/c I was not getting guac. but as soon as I took one bite of this salad I forgot all about it.   The fajitas themselves were quite tasty and contained an array of veggies, not just the typical onions and peppers. The hubs enjoyed this but I am grossed out by mushrooms so I had to keep looking and picking to make sure none made their way into my mouth!   We ended the meal with the Churros and it was a perfect end and totally satisfied my sweet tooth.   I am excited to go back and try more things on the menu and, eventually, have some of those margaritas myself!",

When I did not get messages and showed the lady in the desk that I only received the one text message that let us know we checked in, they then apologized and sat us after being so rude. If we would had not noticed who knows how long we would have been sitting outside waiting. We ordered the queso and didn't get the tortillas that go with it, we asked one of the waitresses to bring the tortillas and she never did so we asked someone else to and she did bring them. Waitress kept skipping us when she was doing rounds for her table section. Also after being so frustrated after this meal the sugar rim margarita I ordered was a bitter salt rim! This was my first experience and definitely my last one at cantina 1511. The only highlight of my experience was the bar staff, they were so awesome and nice. They didn't know how to make my drink but did their best to provide me what I asked for.",

You can't hate a $5.00 hand made mojito on a Monday. Have OMB on tap and was able to quaff a Mecktober seasonal that was quite tasty with the salsa and chips.",

Our only complaint is that the tacos, if you get soft tacos, are usually soaked in the juices from the meat and sauces. By the time they come to your table, they are close to inedible because they're so soggy. This doesn't happen every time, but often enough that we tend to order other menu items even though the tacos are our favorite! Their salsa and guacamole are delicious as well. Although, we think their guacamole is a bit overpriced. We enjoy getting take out from here too and they are kind to offer to put the nacho toppings in separate containers so that the chips aren't soggy by the time you get back home! Staff are very friendly too!",

    "text": "The $7 lunch specials get 5 stars.....  all you can eat chips/salsa paired with about 6-ish entrees..... quesadillas, burgers, salads, etc.  All really good.  The Mexican chopped salad with chicken is by far my favorite.  Dinner entrees are all solid - I've tried just about everything over the years.  A tad expensive compared to market rates, perhaps.  4 stars.    As busy as they are, service is efficient and warm.  Lunch or dinner.  5 stars.  I don't recall the day of week, but there is one particular day when they have margarita specials - very reasonably priced.  Even their basic house margarita was fantastic.  5 stars.  The parking is a joke and receives 1 star.  I give them credit for recently trying to offer valet service to improve the situation, but the lot is just too small and not laid out well.  Period.  One day I observed the valet turning people away because the lot was full.  Another day, they had cars (all running but no one in them) lined up two by two all the way out to the sidewalk preventing other cars from entering the lot.  I'm not sure what can be done, and, again, I give them credit for trying something, but it's just not good enough.  If you can walk here or if you can come during off hours, you'll have a fantastic experience.  Drive up when they are busy - you may struggle.",

I still hate paying 10 bucks for guac knowing the ingredients cost nearly nothing but hey what are you going to do?   My gripe on this trip comes in the form of a steak chimichanga. I love chimichangas and I had never had one from 1511, so I ventured to my comfort meal. What came to me was more like a burrito the size of a football. It was not fried, which is why I am calling it a burrito. When I cut into it all I saw was rice, corn and......peas? YES PEAS. There was hardly any steak in my chimichanga. I was very upset, so I only ate half then brought the rest home hoping it would be better the next day in the fridge. That was not the case.   I will be back to 1511, the gf and myself have enjoyed it many times but I will NEVER order from the tex-mex side again.",

The restaurant is super open with a nice bar area and outdoor patio space (with TVs).Parking is plentiful.  Chips and salsa were good and plentiful. The salsa had a perfect spicyness kick for me. Neither salsa nor chips ever went empty.  Ordered the Pina Margarita cause it was one of the few drinks on the menu without that sugary mix stuff....not a fan of that. The marg was delish....though, after reading reviews, I wish I got the Picanta Pina Marg for a little extra kick. Next time!  Ordered the Ancho Shrimp Salad. Nice portion and the shrimp was seasoned well. The dressing was soooo good. Though, I doubt there was anything healthy about it cause it was so creamy! One of my friends didnt like guac, so I ate her guac on her nachos. Definitely will be ordering the guac next time!  Staff was super friendly and attentive.",

Pretty cheap.   If you order the nachos, leave the onions and green peppers off. I think this contributed to the weird flavor; but all in all it was really good.   Service was good.

This Mexican food will come with a price, but I promise you'll be very impressed with the taste.  They have some very unique Mexican dishes & you aren't going to see your ordinary Mexican menu items. They add their own flare to each dish & I'm not sure I've ever had a better enchilada dish than here. I'm not sure what sauce they use, but it sets it off. They also make the guacamole in front of you & they add a little spice to it as well. Once again, I don't think I've ever had better guacamole.  Cantina's food comes with a price, but it truly is worth it. This beats the upscale Mexican chains by a long shot. You'll leave this place impressed & wondering to yourself why you didn't think of this first.",

It's packed on weekends--usually with a somewhat younger, louder crowd, but it's by no means a fratty place--so make a reservation in advance and prepare to wait a little once you show up, but trust me: it's worth it.   Cantina has all you'd expect from a nicer Mexican restaurant, with a lot of the extras. You'll definitely want to order a top-shelf margarita--easily one of the best in Charlotte, if not the best. Try the Kiwi/Strawberry Special if you're up for a change; it's delicious. Good Mexican beers are on tap as well. Drink up. Everyone else is.   As for the food, I dont know where to begin or end. The chopped tostada salad is to die for if it's lighter fare you're craving. If you want some good 'ol refriend beans and pulled chicken, you won't be disappointed. My favorite? The Kobe beef fajitas. Trust me. Order this.   I'm definitely going back. What I wont do, however, is plan on having a big night afterward. The scene is fun and loud, but you're about as full and tired as you can be when the meal's over. Which is a good thing.",

We mentioned this to the waitress and she apologized profusely, explaining the menu change.  No problem, we said, we'll find something else, thinking that was the end of the discussion.     Next thing we know, the head chef was standing at our table.  Not sure how to react, he asked us if we were the table that was asking about the veggie taquitos.  We were of course.  He introduced himself (Phil) and went on to apologize for the change and explained the menu and ownership change.  He then asked us what we liked about them and after telling him, he said that he would create something for us.  We gave him our suggestions and he told us not to worry and that he would whip something up great.  He went back to the kitchen and we went back to our sangrias.    When the dishes arrived, we noticed that mine had coleslaw on it and the other plate didn't.  Phil came back out to ask how we liked everything (outstanding of course), but we commented on the missing slaw, and he said that he gave my friend the plate without the slaw because he interpreted her comments that she was vegan and the slaw actually had cheese in it!   We were amazed that not only did they create something off menu for us, but that Phil was attentive enough to pick up on the fact that my friend was a vegan!!  Phil and Cantina are doing it right.  They have amazing food, are in tune with their customers and truly care about their product.  I would give more stars if I could!",

We get sat down order our food, everything up to this point felt pretty standard. We were given chips and salsa before our meal which we happily ate. All of a sudden my friend pulls out two Bobby pins linked together from the chip basket. We were so grossed out. We told our waiter and he looked at us and mumbled something and walked away with the basket. We didn't see him for a while after that. We didn't feel like this was being properly handled so we caught another server who's response was a little better and she said she would grab a manager. The manager comes over and we explain what we found and to be honest, there really wasn't even a True, \"I'm sorry\" or anything. The four of us all work in customer service and couldn't believe the lack of service we were provided. We simply wanted reactions that were more than \"That's weird.\" Or \"That's gross.\"  The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the main food was really good, but who wants to eat their food after finding someone's hair products in their food?",

I can contest that it was some damn good guac. I know that this isn't helpful at all, but past that, I really don't remember what I ate....but I do remember that it was really good....sorry! Anyhow, the server was incredibly attentive and he let us sit outside even though no one else was. Food was good, atmosphere was nice and I'd say Cantina deserves a solid four stars. I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in CLT.",

    "text": "After moving to Charlotte, there was one common refrain that I constantly heard: \"You need to go to Cantina 1511.  It is excellent.\"  Well, I went.  And it was far from excellent.  The food itself was good, but it was not outrageously delicious as I had been promised.  The food was just as good as at any standard Mexican restaurant.  Everything else, however, was far different.  Despite having a reservation, we waited for almost an hour to be seated.  There was a huge crowd of people in the waiting area, so the wait was uncomfortable.  Also, the bar was so crowded that it would have been very difficult to get a drink for the wait.  And the huge crowd also magnified the inadequacy of their parking.  The atmosphere was nice, definitely a step up from a standard Mexican restaurant.  However, you pay for that step up, and pay dearly.  Unfortunately, I can't remember any specifics, but everything was expensive.  I doubt anyone could get out for under $15 unless they skipped the drink, appetizers and desert.  The guacamole is allegedly great, but I am not a guac fan, so I passed.  The drinks are also very expensive.  A pitcher of mojito went for north of $60, as I recall.  In summary, the food was good.  I have since gone to a wedding reception that they catered, and it was great.  But the wait and the prices make Cantina a poor choice in my book.  There must be plenty of people that disagree, though, based on how busy it was.  Cantina is a place to see and be seen, not to get good food for reasonable prices.",

The drinks are awesome. They have good happy hour deals on food. Sitting at the bar area is actually pleasant. Great patio for a nice day, fun to wear sunglasses, people watch, and watch the cars drive by and all the South Charlotte runners. Ambiance is not cheesy at all, hostesses and servers are friendly, etc. There is a weird fishbowl room for large groups that I would avoid if you come in a large group. But definitely make a reservation, you will need it-- this place gets packed! If you come on a Sunday after church the crowd is full of Uptown/Dilworth \"society\" families schmoozing. But that does not detract at all from how great Cantina is!",

Authentic seems hard to find here, but I'll settle for consistent reminiscence of it.  The ground beef tacos and cilantro rice are great, the salsa actually is not runny, and the guac is good.  On the weekend, the chicken with mole special was pretty good though I could only make it through a few bites after all the pre-dinner snacking.  No More Chips!",

The menu is split into two sections: authentic Mexican dishes on one side and the Americanized entrees we're all used to on the other.  Their specialty is handmade guacamole made tableside with a mortar and pestle.  I usually avoid guacamole like the plague (mostly because of the appearance, if I'm honest) but I gotta admit, this stuff was very tasty!  If you're looking for a unique Mexican dining experience, give Cantina 1511 a visit!",

I mentioned to my waiter how fresh everything appeared, and he told me that  everything is fresh and that they in fact make their own cheeses.Try the pork and pinapple tacos \"Tacos Al Pastor\"  they are to die for!

If you go for lunch the prices are cheaper but the portions are just as large, so I recommend lunch.   Many of their dishes come in a small or large size, so you can pick how much food you want.  Lunch can be under $10, but with drinks dinner will cost $15.  I highly recommend the chicken tostada salad and the barbicoa pork.  Half price margs on Tuesdays!!",

One of the best things I've tried at Cantina is their margaritas - absolutely delcicious and a variety to choose from. The only reason I'm not giving them a five is the prices. The fantastic margaritas I mentioned come at a hefty price - to the tune of $40-50/pitcher. So, as good as they taste, your buzz is killed when the check comes. Still, I'd highly recommend this place for a special occasion restaurant or date night with someone you'd like to impress.",

I usually like a seafood taco but choices were limited and everything seem to include jalapeno bacon. I ended up with ancho chicken which was to include avocado slices and it did not.When I asked my waitress about it she said no it did not include avocado. I guess I should have asked for the menu and pointed it out that it is listed. Anyway the chicken was bad with a strange ortega taco seasoning tast. My friend had the traditional enchilades and she said they were not bad but nothing to write home about. I am sticking with Azteca on Independence.",

    "text": "I decided to try out Cantina 1511 primarily because it got good reviews and was listed as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte.  I was prepared not to like this place because it seemed to be to hip and trendy for me.  I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it is clean, well maintained and serves good food.  I went to Cantina 1511 on a Saturday for lunch.  It was a cold, rainy day but the parking lot was pretty full.  Since I was by myself the hostess asked if I wanted to sit in the bar area and that was fine with me.  They had high top tables and leather couches to sit on.  I grabbed a seat on one of the couches as it was near the TV and I could watch some football while I ate.  I thought the couch might be a problem when it came to eating, but it really wasn't an issue.  The waitress came over shortly after I was seated, dropped off a menu and took my drink order.  I order a Dos Equis Amber, which I recently discovered is an outstanding beer.  She gave a few moments while she got my beer and some chips & salsa.  The menu is pretty simple with traditional & tex-mex version of the standard Mexican fare.  I ordered three tacos from the traditional menu, al pastor, carnitas Johnny, and carne asada.  I sipped my beer and watched the game.  My food came out pretty fast.  The presentation was very nice and the portions size was good.  I tried the carne asada taco first.  It was delicious.  The flavor of the steak was excellent and it was very juicy.  I really couldn't tell you what other garnish was on the taco, because I was concentrating on the flavor of the meat.  I'm pretty sure there was some sauteed onion and peppers which complimented the meat well.  Next I tried the carnintas taco.  It was also delicious.  The flavor of the pork was great and it was very juicy.  Last was the taco al pastor.  Slow cooked pork with shredded cabbage, roasted pineapple, habanero crema and fresh cilantro.  I thought the combination of the pork and pineapple would be interesting and it was.  This taco was good, but didn't quite do it for me.  I'd probably double up on the carne asada or carnitas next time.  The plate came with tortilla slaw, vegetable rice and beans.  The sides were all pretty good and a nice compliment to the meal.  To me Cantina 1511 seems to be a hip, trendy place, but I'm a middle aged fat guy. I was very skeptical and prepared to not like it, but Cantina 1511 serves some very good food.  The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable.  I learned my lesson here, don't judge a restaurant by it's trendiness, judge it by the food it serves.  And for Cantina 1511 it serves some very tasty food.",

I was almost looking for a hidden camera.  It was absolutely disgusting.

Not that over the top typical \"Mexican restaurant\" atmosphere with the colorful wooden chairs that's sooo overdone.   Another reason this restaurant is one of our favs is the size. We can typically get in no problem because there is so much seating. That's really nice, especially on a Friday night when you realize you forgot to make reservations.   We also bring our pup and eat on their patio pretty often in the summer. We love their Sunday brunch.  I do have to say the last 3 times we sat on their patio for brunch (last summer and fall) the music they were playing was horrible. It was almost physically painful, but I'd still say this place gets a 5/5",

Since I'm getting used to eating Carolina Reaper sauce I can't claim that this burger had much heat to it. What I will say is that it was very flavorful! The burger had a decent heft to it as well.

The Problem I had here was trying to get the bartenders attention, It took 10-15 minutes to order 2 margaritas. To top it off, I felt like the margarita was just all sour mix, I couldn't taste the booze at all! Next we sat down and our server was very nice and kind of funky. But the food we brought out was just okay. I was in the mood for some really good Mexican food ( and we have heard good things about Cantina) but at the end we just got an OKAY meal. I probably won't return.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Park Road Shopping Center in Charlotte, North Carolina and to Cantina 1511. This upscale casual restaurant offers a unique variety of Mexican fares.  Dora here. What a gorgeous day! Too nice to sit inside and what a comfortable, relaxing outdoor space! They certainly live up to their creed, \"A tapestry of flavor, color, aromas and textures happening in a joyous and friendly atmosphere.\" As usual, we arrived super early, but this patio was jammed by the time we left.  For my meal, I ordered the Antojitos, an assortment of foods one might find on the streets of Mexico City, and the selection changes daily. Today, it included Nachos, Tlayudas (sometimes referred to as Mexican Pizza), Pig Wings Carnitas, and Salmon wraps. All four of these items were great, but my favorite was the Pig Wings Carnitas, pork shanks flash fried and tossed in an orange caramel sauce. As you can probably tell, they were crispy on the outside and full of favor. The salmon wrap was packed with fish, very tasty, and my second favorite.  Dora here. I don't usually choose to eat Mexican food because I tend to overeat. Shocker, I know, but those chips, y'all!! I could eat an entire basket by myself, especially here, where both the chips and salsa were soooo good. Just a little kick in the salsa and tomatoey thick. Yum! The Chicken Chimichanga was plump with chicken, black beans, and rice and a smattering of corn and cheese. Delicious, one of the best I've ever eaten, with all my favorite ingredients, and the slaw was a perfect accompaniment to add depth and crunch. I did not finish it, but I didn't leave the table feeling stuffed, either. What I really enjoyed about this dish was the fresh flavor.  What's your favorite Mexican dish? We'd love to know!

The back room is literally like stepping into chucky cheese...we were there for a ladies night out and they tried to seat us smack in the middle of that junk. It was horrid.  We requested another seat and it was slightly better.  Our server was sweet and the guacamole is still good.  However, my tacos and whole dish came out cold, flavorless and nasty.  The wine list is brutal and the prices don't make sense.  It used to be this cool trendy spot but honestly since it has changed into a playpen they need to adjust the menu prices accordingly.  I have zero desire to come back. Stonecrest might be better but I highly doubt it.",

And we noticed that our entrees were taking a long time (45 minutes).  Everyone around us had gotten their meals and ours were super simple (a bowl of soup and a quesadilla). So I politely asked if our waiter would check for us.  He came back a few minutes later saying we were one of the next 1-2 tickets.  10 minutes later he brings out a burrito to my husband - who ordered a quesadilla).  So we sent that back.  5 minutes later he brings out my soup covered in cheese (I asked for no cheese), so I sent that back.  Etc, etc.    One would think that now would be an excellent time to offer some sort of discount if not the entire ticket comped due to the repetitive mistakes and excessive wait times.  Nope.  Full price, no apologies.  Overall the food is really good here but experience was pretty poor.  Hope they make some improvements to customer experience.",

The meal I received was worst than the last time. I ordered Carne Asada (the same item I ordered before). I requested that the steak be cooked medium with no onions. When I received the order, it has onions and was charred black. The salsa was dated 3/15. I'm not sure if that was the package date or the use by date. I didn't take a chance with it either way. The potatoes were whole potatoes (as opposed to being quartered) with no flavor. All in all, the food was terrible. I will not be ordering from them again.",

Surely that awful server was fired by now. Everyone deserves a second chance and I'm glad that I did. Went on a Saturday and it was packed, so we sat at the bar, that had plenty of empty seats. The bar tender was very attentive, making the guacamole by hand in our presence. Throughout the meal, she check on us consistently and even offered advice about the menu. I had the salmon, which came with potatoes and spinach. The salmon was smaller than what I expected, but was really tasty and ended up being filling. So I guess the proportions were adequate after all. My friend, who is a vegetarian had the wild mushroom quesadillas and she liked them a lot. The guac that came with them was small compared to the amount of quesadilla. So I would ask for heavy guac if you order a quesadilla. Additionally, I had the house margarita. Tasty and I had a little buzz. Be careful with the margarita on the rocks as it's stronger than frozen. Overall, a great experience. Highly recommended.",

But my girlfriend had a gift certificate (YAY) and we were going to see a movie at Park Terrace next door (YAY), so onward.   Arriving at 12:30 over the Christmas holiday, the hostesses were very friendly and I was seated immediately.  Soon after my ears started to bleed (not really, I am being a drama queen) because it is nerve-deafeningly loud in there.  To their credit, it was a full house during peak lunchtime, but good dog.  We had to scream across the table to be heard.  The waiter was efficient, especially considering how busy they were.   He kept the glasses of two very thirsty girls filled.  Though I love queso, I refuse to pay $10 for it, so we went cheese-less.  The complimentary chips and salsa were fresh and good. My order of a beef chimichanga ($13.75) was fine.  *shrug  For $14 you get a very large chimichanga with a pile of lettuce/pico.  There may have been 8 small pieces of steak in it.  Meh.  Good wait staff.  And for me, passable food but nothing that I crave or would look forward to.",

    "text": "For Sunday evening dinner, while in Charlotte, we took a break from southern cooking and chili dogs and such and decided to have some Mex.  It is always a crap shoot when you go to a new city and try to pick a decent Mexican place.  We read a few reviews and decided on Cantina 1511.  Well, we've had better and we've had worse.  Starting with the salsa which was amateurish loaded with cumin \"because that's what makes it Mexican\" (I heard a guy say that once).  The guacamole \"made\" at the table is kind of like semi-made at the table.  It is a large order, made with two avocados.  But the lime juice is pre-squeezed so the fragrant oils are lost completely.  The tomato and onion and cilantro are supplied by using some premixed pico with large onion hunks.  We don't want the hunks of raw onion so asked our server to leave the pico and we picked through it to have some tomato.  We also asked for more lime to add, since they did not add enough.  He brought us more, but again, pre-squeezed.   After sorting out enough tomato from the pico and adding more lime juice and salt, we made it OK to eat.  They really need to juice the limes with the little manual juicer at the table.  Ms T had fish tacos (they were fried, not grilled) and declared that they simply had no flavor.  They were made from the ubiquitous tilapia, (which normally tastes like dirt to me) floured in masa.  These did not taste like fish or dirt or masa.  Just fried stuff.  I ordered Tacos al Pastor.  This style of meat has become popular in the US in the last couple of years and it is rarely made right.  Cantina 1511 joins that club.  I really don't expect a trompo of seasoned pork that gets cut off with a large machete and grilled to crisp it a bit, like a good gyro.  But this was shredded pork stew, sweetened, too wet.  It is not supposed to be sweet.  I have eaten in the restaurant in Mexico City that claims (who knows if True) to have invented the style.  Cantina 1511's version is not even good by US standards.  The rice was the plastic pellet style, I guess made from converted or instant rice.  The black beans were pretty cuminy, not well seasoned.  It is a very nice place.  Jamal provided excellent service.  They are trying to be modern Mexican, but are not quite getting there.  I would keep looking for Mexican in Charlotte.",

They came out in a reasonable time, but were cold in the middle. They were also a bit chewy as if they had been frozen and then nuked in the microwave. I also had the  corn tortilla soup which was ok, but a bit too oily. My older child had the chopped salad, which was bland and came with beets which ruined the flavor. The salsa was good, though, with a bit of a smokey flavor.   We sent our cold dishes back, which is something we rarely do, and it was hotter when it came back. The bill for the five dishes, one of them off the child's menu, ( 2 of them the smaller portions), water to drink and no appetizers came to over $70 before tip.  Nice enough staff and pretty decor, but with so many other choices around, we won't be going back.",

The Bad: - The Chimichanga had corn inside (it wasn't listed on the menu). - The soup one party member ordered was not delivered as an appetizer as requested, but instead was delivered with the rest of the entrees. - The prices recently went up (December, 2014) which means that two taco's now cost $12 (previously, they were $10). That 20% price increase is seen across the menu.",

The new location is definitely more accommodating, but has lost what was previously mentioned.  Now it feels more like a big, open, casual, and loud atmosphere.  I can't help but compare Cantina to Paco's Taco's down in South Park, which at this point has Cantina beaten in pretty much every meaningful way for me.  The food is tastier, the vibe is classier, and dollar for dollar it is cheaper.  Also, no more duck tacos?  Why remove such a great thing?",

We waited close to 45 mins for food to come out. One of us ordered fajitas, which came out on a white plate, looked like something from a frozen dinner. When we asked why it wasn't on a sizzling plate, she said it was only served that way at dinner- seriously, when have you ever had fajitas NOT served on a sizzling plate. The chicken & veggies weren't even hot. The waitress never asked how everything was bc she knew we were unhappy. This restaurant has gone down hill over the years. I don't think I will ever return. How disappointing to spend $100 on lunch only to have a waitress ruin the meal. VERY DISAPPOINTING- stay away.",

Their guacamole, chopped salad, blood orange margarita, ahhhh.... The good 'ol days.  I have visited the new Park Road location about 5 times and I don't think I will ever go back again after receiving such awful service. I overlooked it at first because I loved it too much. But it becomes hard to ignore when you can barely get your server's attention all night.  This week, we visited Cantina and paid almost $10 for guacamole, which we really enjoy there, and the waitress didn't bring us chips for 20 minutes. How annoying. The food also does not seem fresh or as high quality as it used to be- especially for the price. On one date night, we placed our order and the waiter brought out our food in less than five minutes- like it had just been heated up in the microwave! Yuck.  I am very disappointed in the direction that Cantina has gone, and I am so sad to say that I will not be visiting again. If you are considering Cantina, I would encourage you to search a little harder to find another great Mexican place with better service and quality :)",

I also had a margarita and maybe I should have ordered top shelf (or no ice) because I didn't really feel like I was drinking alcohol. It does seems like they are a little onion heavy because there were onions in the queso (a first for me but kinda good) and I had a great deal of onions in my quesadilla so be mindful of that.",

They were completely out of there house margarita by 7 pm which sucks Bc that's my favorite kind of drink and I hadn't anticipated the price of what they did have available (they still are not serving half their drink menu understandable they just opened.)  The staff was friendly but I was waiting for my drink to be refilled a couple times (not so good when your eating spicy food). The place was good but not for the price or the wait.

I order gluten free as I have celiac disease and they always prepare my food safely.  A huge huge HUGE plus is that they have a dedicated fryer for their chips- so I can eat basket after basket after basket with their delicious and slightly smokey house made salsa.  I usually order the Marco Polo taco because, why wouldn't i? I often get another taco and the fish one is great as well as he classic beef one.  Their salad you can get is delicious on the side and the rice and beans are pretty good.   I like their margaritas and feel they are just strong enough.  Sitting outside is great and inside can be a bit loud.  Depending on timing, there can be long waits. I will keep returning regardless.",

But they give you a generous portion of chips and salsa and the salsa is good.  Guacamole: Was everything I expected and more! The habanero peppers gave it a great kick, was impressed. Awesome.  Tacos: YUM. I couldn't decide which I liked better between the Asada, Chipotle Ancho Chicken, and Pulled Pork. Asada steak and pulled pork were definitely in the top. I was a bit skeptical of the pork and pineapple combo, but they know what they're doing here at the Cantina.  Barbacoa Entree: It was really good, although a little dry. I didn't notice much of the dryness because it came with a heaping portion of avocado and the beans and rice were addictive. Top that baby off with a sprinkle of the cheese and that explains why I feel super preggers right now. It was worth it... delish.  Nutella Pie: For $5.95 this is not bad because the portion is huge, but I wasn't really a fan. It was covered in more chocolate and caramel sauce than I cared for; I guess there is such thing as too much of a good thing. Also, it was a little too mushy.   Overall this was a great experience and the food was good - the server filled up the water quick, came to check on us frequently, and was glad to split our bill. Plus, the damage was a mere $42 between 2 people for the 3 tacos, guac, Barbacoa, and pie!",

Dont get me wrong, I love the food there, the atmosphere, and the staff have always been fantastic! I would not keep eating there otherwise. But, come on, the head hanchos need to learn a little respect there! Not only are there customers, including children around, but last time I checked, you dont treat people like that. It certainly made my meal less apetizing!",

I was initally drawn in by the promise of half priced pitchers of margaritas but the food was so incredible and the service so nice that I have returned twice just to keep sampling the vast menu.   This past week I met up with two girlfriends for some great food and a little chitchat. The chips and two kinds of salsa that appear on the table could almost sustain me for the evening but I knew there were entrees calling my name. I have celiac disease so I need to avoid gluten and sometimes that can be a problem when I eat out. However, when I asked the server to point me toward menu items made with corn tortillas she immediately asked, do you not eat gluten? I was impressed. She showed me what items are n ormally made with corn tortillas but then told me that I could order any quesadilla with corn instead of flour tortillas and said she would check with the kitchen for anything else I might be interested in. How nice!  I ended up splitting the Enchiladas de Dennis with my friend. The waitress said they were one of the most popular menu items. They were so delicious. Corn tortillas stuffed with chicken and spinach and cheeses. Yummy! We all enjoyed dinner and I cannot wait to go back and try something else.",

You can get better carnitas at any regular Mexican restaurant with authentic dishes.  The al pastor taco was the best dish I had, and I would recommend that if you visit.  The margaritas were large and properly balanced and worth the $10.  Chips and salsa were solid.  Decor / Ambiance: fairly typical colorful Mexican restaurant dining room with a more upscale bar/lounge area with leather chairs, dark wood tables, etc.  The \"private\" group dining room surrounded by glass walls at entrance was oddly situated.    Service: Waitress was probably a B+, except when I asked for the Mexico City street-style corn, the she said \"they were out the last time she checked a couple of days ago.\"  OK....  Overall: Cantina 1511 undoubtedly has great local press along with positive Yelp reviews and a very promising menu.  Unfortunately, the food quality was just not there.  Overall, Cantina 1511 feels like a chain version of an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant.",

Maybe I don't know where the good places are?  Anyway, we stopped by for a drink, in this case a couple of margaritas, but I was looking at the food menu and got tempted into ordering a couple of tacos.  The al pastor pork taco and the carne asada steak taco were calling my name.  Both tacos were excellent, but I would get the al pastor only next time, as the cabbage, pineapple and cilantro really went well together.  The tacos came with beans and rice, which I enjoyed, but I was already overly stuffed with the tacos.  I had ordered a lunch portion at 10$ and it was a very good value for the amount of food that I received.  Sitting outside on the patio was nice despite the heat.

We weren't prepared for the half price pitchers on Mondays, but I did have a very tasty frozen margarita.  We ordered things from the \"Authentic\" side of the menu and were not disappointed. The Camarones Mojo y Ajo had a delicious unique flavor.  The Enchiladas Sulzas were very tasty, and the side of beans are AWESOME.  We also each enjoyed a taco on the side - I recommend avoiding the crispy shell (with so much stuffing it broke fairly quickly) but the Carne Asada and Carnitas Johnny tacos both were delicious.  We had enough food to feel super full (even though their desserts sound tasty too!) and I have some leftovers, too.  It was a bit pricier than we're used to paying for Mexican food which may prevent us from going all the time, but we'll definately be back!",

I decided to stop in by myself to order some food, once I was seated and placed my order I went to the restroom to wash my hands why is it that a waitress that wasn't mine cleared my appetizer and drink from my table? She brought me out another one and said she was sorry so I let it go, but when my food came out I found debris in it, the waiter stated that he would have another plate remade for me so when the next plate came out there was a long piece of hair wedged in the meal, needless to say my appetite was destroyed and I left the restaurant, Cantina 1511 is definitely off my eating list.",

Its a trendy resturant but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Service here is good and they have a multitude of drink selections, sangrias, margaritas etc.  On my last dinner visit I had the special, chicken enchilada suizas. It was not very good. The sauce was a watered down green mole and the enchiladas were not cooked to a perfection. They weren't buttery flaky and didn't melt under my fork. The chicken was bland, it just tasted boiled. I can say that Azteca has a better version of enchilada suizas.  Not a deal breaker, as I do like this place. Next time I'll just have to try a different dish. Great chips and salsa though and after work drinking here is a must!!!",

    "text": "With much trepidation and encouragement from management after my last visit, I decided to give Cantina 1511 one more chance. Sadly I left disappointed yet again. When my date and I arrived I was told there was a 30 to 40 minute wait to be seated, not a big deal given that it was a Saturday night. What the hostess failed to inform me of was that it was 30 to 40 minutes without factoring in the reservations she had on her list. In my opinion, those should have been factored into the estimate or at a minimum mentioned so that I could factor them in myself. After waiting an hour and 30 minutes we were finally seated. Upon being seated we were met by what I'm assuming was the front of the house manager who promptly offered us a drink and appetizer on her, which we graciously accepted. A few minutes later we had placed our dinner orders and were enjoying our table-side guacamole and queso along with a lovely house red wine. After about 54 minutes, our dinners had finally arrived (a bit of a lengthy wait for dinner, but it was a Saturday night). Much to my dismay mine was incorrect. What I received was very tasty, but again, not what I ordered. The general manager of the restaurant came and spoke with us and decided that our dinners that evening would be on him for our inconvenience and picked up our check. With all of that being said, please let me add that I have never received less than exceptional service from the wait staff at Cantina 1511. When there is an issue, management seems to go above and beyond to try to make it right for you, but if they would focus in making it right the first time, they wouldn't have to try to make up for any shortfalls that occurred during you dining experience.",

I like it, I really do but maybe my taste buds and palette isn't distinguished enough to discern between Mexican meals.  What I mean is, yeah it was fine and the fresh and all things good but I didn't come away from the place thinking OMG, I can't wait to get back.  One thing I will say is that I really like the upscale (compared to most Mexican joints) interiors.  So if I want to step it up a couple notches from some place like an Azteca, I'll visit Cantina.  But if I'm looking to just get down and grub on some Mexican cuisine I'd probably stick to the Azteca type faire.",

While I'm a frequent visitor of the location in Dilworth, the location off Rea Road is just as good, though the ambiance is better in Dilworth. Margaritas are good and they usually always have Corona on special. Outside patio is fun too, especially for lunch on a nice day. The lunch specials are affordable and plentiful.   For dinner, I'm a table side guac guy and a barbacoa fan. The barbacoa fills me up for only $12. Traditional food and some specialty fare allows for many choices. I do break out sometimes a go for the Enchiladas Dennis or the Carne Asada Quesadillas. Great for groups of friends or families. I've celebrated many of friends birthdays here. Great food and not too expensive for everyone.",

    "text": "Where in Charlotte has authentic, fresh Mexican and Tex-Mex? Cantina Fifteen Eleven, of course. Once you get there, though, the question is, \"Who is Dennis and why are his enchiladas so delicious?\" Dennis is clearly a culinary genius who deserves a promotion and a bonus, because the roasted chicken, spinach and Mexican cheese enchiladas bathing in Chile con queso and avocado and red pepper crema is the most craveable dish on the Cantina menu.   There are complimentary chips and two types of salsa on the the table, but that is where the similarities end compared to other Mexican restaurants. Guacamole is made table side by servers and there are creative versions of Mexican classics that are surprising and gratifying. Jicama in the Chopped Mexican Salad, goat cheese, spinach and wild mushrooms in a quesadilla, and Salmon al Pastor are just the start of a menu comprised of fresh and unexpected choices at Cantina Fifteen Eleven.   Weekend nights are packed at the Dilworth location of Cantina, and valet parking is offered and recommended. The parking lot is small, and maneuvering within is often a tedious process.  Inside, there is ambient lighting shining from the star-shaped Mexican lanterns, comfortable seating and attentive servers and barkeeps who kept an eleven member Friday night group satisfied in a timely manner.   In addition to the Dilworth location, there is another Cantina in the Stonecrest shopping center on Rea Road. Though the menus and food quality are identical, the Dilworth location seems to offer a more festive and authentic atmosphere.",

Fresh made chips and salsa to begin, awesome, but salsas (verde and roja) were too salty. Ordered the table side guac appetizer because it came highly recommended by my fellow yelpers, however, I wasn't super impressed. I'm pretty sure I can make better guac for much less than $9.   My date and I were feeling slightly crazy and wanted to order the family taco plate for the two of us (8-9 tacos), but the waitress talked us down from it. We each got the 3 taco plate (lots of tacos = more variety = more accurate review of restaurant?). He got the carnitas johnny, carne asada steak, and taquitos vegetarianos. I got 3 fish tacos (damn you self-imposed pescetarianism!). Fish tacos were just okay. Lightly breaded pieces of tilapia on a bed of cabbage, topped with diced tomatoes. The saving grace was the chipotle crema and \"Mexican hot sauce\" (tapatio? cholula?) mixture they had going on. My favorite was the taquitos vegetarianos, lots of flavor and veggies stuffed in a not-that-crispy taco shell (which was fine with me). I was told the carne asada was just meh and the carnitas johnny was good, however, after eating those two and then having a fish taco, the fish taco tasted completely bland.   Atmosphere was conducive to date night and decor was modern. Service was just okay, I'm thinking our waitress was new because she wasn't familiar with a couple of things, but she was nice enough. Although it felt like we were being rushed through our meal from the start.   We had a few things boxed up (couldn't finish our 6 tacos, fail) and someone in the kitchen threw away the left overs before they could be boxed, but they were nice enough to make new tacos for us. Score, more tacos for later!   Overall, I would return to try other dishes, but will know to specify less salt.   My quest for a good fish taco in Charlotte continues...",

This is a convenient place I frequent whether I need a big, tasty margarita and a few delicious appetizers or when I require a full blown Mexican fiesta.  Some of my favorites include the incredible table side guacamole - that you can request as spicy as you like, the \"street\" tacos - the pulled pork with pineapple and the fried shrimp are amazing, the Mexican chopped salad - which also comes in a smaller (more manageable) lunch sized portion and, of course, the tres leches cake.  Cantina definitely has a hold on modern Mexican cuisine - just make sure you make reservations or get there early enough to score a table. It gets especially busy on Thurs - Sat evenings. Hubs and I routinely grab a table in the bar area to avoid the wait. They also have a great patio that looks on to East Blvd.  Great food, great service - I'm a big fan of Cantina!  Oh and be careful where you park - while Cantina does have quite a sizeable parking lot, make sure you read any signage posted - the neighboring stores/tenants will tow you if your in the wrong spot at the wrong time!",

The mexican chopped salad was decent but I HATED the dressing and needed a lighter vinaigrette instead of this cumin/mayo option.  Crab quesadilla was fantastic in all it's buttery, cheesy gooey glory It needed no salsa, no sour cream and definitly no guacamole.  My man had the Mexican meatball sandwich with jalapeno/cheese bisque and it was apparently out of this world!

They have $10 off pitchers of any margaritas on Thursday's, so we got the house and my guac to start.  Pitcher was huge!!  I really wasn't expecting it to be so big and with just the 2 of us it was too much.  We were both so full from liquids that I barely ate dinner, which was the barbacoa.  Guac was pretty good, maybe too much lime juice though.  Barbacoa was good, never had it before but it did seem a bit dry to me, still tasty though.  Sister got garlic shrimp, tasted like scampi but they were yummy.  Dessert was quatros leches, good but they put a meringue top on it and it was not needed and we scraped it off.  Our server was great and made sure our water was never empty and we had plenty of chips.  Only thing that was annoying, and is totally my fault, I had a Citi Pass coupon and didn't realize till the next day so we could have gotten 1 entree freeish.  Oh well my fault for never remembering to check that book!!",

ALSO, and honestly, if you want real Mexican food- go to a restaurant where you see other Mexicans sitting and eating. This is, what I consider, a white people Mexican place. Not to offend. If I want a step, or a few steps, above my normal Mexican spots I like to dine (like Marias, Azteca, etc) at Cantina.  Love the food- I usually get the Burritos and they are LARGE. I always have enough to take home the next day. The beans always taste fresh and the chips and salsa before the meal are excellent. We've had the guac. a few times and it's great, but it's not a staple everytime we dine b/c it is a tad expensive.  The Margheritas, though pricey, are also EXCELLENT! If you're in Charlotte and want an upscale Mexican/Tex Mex place- this is the spot to go. In fact, I'm going this weekend....Can't wait!",

Even better, I do not feel guilty about eating at a restaurant that is conscientious of where its food comes from. The red meat is farm raised (/grazed) and there is even a gluten-free menu.   Frank Scibelli really cares about executing authentic cuisine to people who care about more than fine dining, but also consumption.  (Scibelli also owns and is chef at Mama Ricotta's).  Dinner with drinks may run about thirty+ a head.  I have eaten on the patio and found the dining area to be a little darker than I'd like, but the music was nice. .

After sitting down, 50 minutes after arriving, the server rushed us to place an order and then proceeded to forget to bring our drinks. 35 more minutes passed and it took a complaint to the manager to get our food delivered to the table. The food was pretty good, but the service by the host and the server were despicable. I've been going to Cantina 1511 for 2 years and after this horribly unapologetic service, I will never go again. I would only recommend this establishment to an in-law that you despise or a boss that you dislike.",

Sadly we chose to come back today and decided to sit at the bar. 3 pm on a Saturday and there are a total of 8 people at the bar.   Service is atrocious. The woman behind the bar could not be bothered to serve the clients as she was too busy ignoring us and cleaning glassware. We ordered the guacamole at $9 a pop and had to ask repeatedly for chips. Our beer glasses were empty for 10 minutes and she finally asked if we wanted more beer. By now I only want water and my damn check. Too bad cuz I thought I found a great local place to go.

    "text": "So I finally decided I have to say something.    Three separate stories - sorry if it's long!   A few months ago - my friend and I were at cantina and ordered queso (with no onions) they put in the queso these weird long skinny onions in their queso - it came with onions... Boooo we then ordered a pitcher of margaritas - the waiter recommended we upgrade our tequila, making it a $40 pitcher- ok no problem lets do it!  First pitcher - tasted ok and we finished it with ease... So we decided to get a second pitcher - it came and we finished 3/4 of it... And we didn't even have a buzz... My friend made the comment \"these taste like only mix!\" I agreed we didn't even feel anything after each having a pitcher basically... So we asked for the manager and told him these pitchers didn't have any tequila in them! He said \"what!? Ok...\" And took it to the back... He offered us shots instead!? Shots!? I'm eating dinner at 8pm not at the club.... Awkward... We were like uhhhh no. He came back to the table and said he went in the back and tasted it and said it tasted like only mix! Well duh that's what we told you!!! He took one pitcher off the bill for us.... We walked out sober. And with onion breath. Bleh.   Last month - my friend and I sat at the bar and ordered a margarita just a glass this time. We finished one and ordered another - SHE made the same comment \"is there tequila in this thing!?\" I hadn't ever told her my past experience... We were through 2 margaritas at this point and she said something to the bartender who gave us the worst attitude and said \"well do you want a double then?!\" She said \"no I just want a margarita that tastes like it has tequila in it!\"   Last night - a couple of friends came over and the first thing they said when they walked in \"well we tried to catch a buzz at cantina but the pitcher didn't have any tequila in it!!!!\" Omg right!?! I told them what had happened to me!!! Not surprised!!!!   3 times/stories no liquor in the drinks!!!! Good atmosphere but plan on walking out sober!",

Host was not sympathetic and told us we should have made a reservation even though this guideline is not posted online. Unprofessional and unaccommodating, refusing at first to even seat our group separately although there were multiple tables we could see that were available. Will not be back.",

We are salad lovers, and the 1511 salad has always been our favorite, but not since the relocation.  Salad was bland and served with three slices of chicken (as ordered) but the chicken was overcooked and under seasoned.  Margarita seemed watered down.  The kids menu for our grandchildren was much better than our dinner.  I really hope they can bring this restaurant back to the wonderful restaurant it was before on East Blvd.  I miss it.

Recently visited on a Saturday for lunch and the crowd wasn't too bad.  They had streamlined there menu some and had a nice lunch menu to choose from.  I ended up having the Ancho Chicken Scaloppini & Cheese (Ancho chicken, caramelized poblano peppers and onions, melted Mexican cheeses) with a side chopped salad.  Dressing on the side, I only used about half of what they gave me but the salad was like crack and I could not get enough.  There were fresh avacados, chickpeas, jicama, greens, corn, black beans, and a whole lot of goodness packed into a small plate of salad.  The chicken on the sandwich was packed full of flavor.  My one comment was that some of the liquid from the chicken made the bread a bit soggy, but I powered through anyway.  The cheeses all melted in your mouth and I was stuffed in a good way for lunch that day.  I know this place is pretty popular in the evenings, but the one thing that I do get annoyed with is the parking situation.  It's great if you live down the street and can walk, but unfortunately the parking lot - they have done the best with what they have, but I do feel awkward parking in front of employees cars (double parking) but I think they do valet too so they can put your car wherever.  The patio is pretty amazing when the weather is cooperating.  And no visit to Cantina 1511 is complete without some tableside guacamole.",

    "text": "Oh how I wish I could have given this very popular place more stars. I don't know, maybe because I grew up in a Mexican neighborhood in Chicago, or that I lived on the West Coast for years, but I have a certain expectation for Mexican food that I have really yet to find here in Charlotte (except at a couple of dive joints down South Blvd). Anyway, I know the whole story about the South African owner, and JWU trained Chefs, blah blah blah. But here's the story....the food just isn't that spectacular. It isn't. The guacamole was good, but had TOO much line and not enough salt to bring out the flavors. It could have used more red onion as well. The chips were good, but lacked salt and didn't seem that fresh to me. The Orange and Spice Crusted Pork Tenderloin was average, and the pork was well done, not a pink center which I asked for. The \"crust\" part was tough to chew, and I just couldn't finish the dish because of it.   I got their \"spicy\" Margarita and while good, I didn't get the whole \"spicy\" flavor that our lovely Community Manager Nikki raved about. I'm thinking, WHERE'S THE HEAT? It did say SPICY didn't it??? Ugggg  The highlight of the evening was them giving us the Queso and tortilla as a complimentary extra. Now THAT was really good....honestly the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2.  The restaurant is really loud, and very busy. Which is a good sign. But I'm convinced that the good folks of Charlotte just haven't had a really GREAT, AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant yet. When you do, you'll see just how different and BETTER it is than all these Tex/Cali Mex places that exist in Charlotte.  Look, this is a decent place for sure. Will I come back? Probably, and just get a darn Burrito, Chimi, Quesaidilla or Fajita. Maybe they do those the best?",

After making an ass of myself about this I was informed that a reservation only moves you to the head of the wait list when you show up. This used to be called \"call ahead\" whereas a reservation should hold you a table. It was a good thing we got there early on a Wednesday evening because at 730 when we left the line was out the door.

    "text": "Cantina is one of my favorite more upscale Mexican restaurants.  They have a nice size outdoor patio and lots of indoor seating.  They also take reservations .  If you want to watch a sporting event there are tons of tvs at the bar area.  Cantina does a really good job with big groups as well.  We went here for dinner and drinks to watch the PGA. (Big deal its Charlottes first one!!! )  For an appetizer I recommend the queso or quac.  They are both reallly tasty!    I have have the Marco Pollo tacos (ahhhmazing), chopped salad, fajitas, and chicken quesadilla (the one with bacon ). Everything is always really good.  The service can be hit or mess and I think that's why Cantina doesn't have 4 stars on Yelp.  Tonight I had to ask for my queso, more chips, and water refills (clearly I was starving and thirsty ), but the food was cooked perfectly!",

However, I must admit that the move to Park Rd from East Blvd has left much to be desired. The previous location had a certain vibe during the warmer months. Open patio, Papa Grandes flowing, guac mixed to perfection...#issavibe. The new location seems congested, loud, and a bit too fast-casual. Not a location I would pick with better atmospheres available in the city.   FOOD Guacamole mixed at the table to spicy preference was good. Better towards the end, so ask your server to mix well. Chips always salted to perfection (little things make a big difference).   I ordered the Thai Chili Shrimp tacos with corn tortillas. They were good...nothing to rave about.   Our food came quickly and correctly, no complaints.",

Cantina 1511 just doesn't do it for me. I've been to this location a few different times for dinner and I've never been impressed. This last visit was no different. The service was a bit off, our waiter was new and didn't really know the menu and seemed to try a bit to hard (he hovered) after we got our food so it was warm at best when we started eating.    As for the food, I've had the tacos, quesadillas and on my most recent visit the chimichanga. Nothing here makes me say \"I'd like to have that again\". I think that's why I've tried so many different options to see if I could find one thing that really blows me away. The chips and salsa were \"meh\", if you like spicy I do recommend the jalapeno version.   Either way, this place isn't my thing. Also, \"Taco Tuesday\" here is kid's night. So keep that in mind when you make your plans. You're welcome.",

    "text": "We ate at Cantina's former location on East Blvd several times, but hadn't ventured to their new Park Road location since they moved.  We go to Flying Biscuit across the shopping center frequently for breakfast, but Cantina 1511 doesn't open for brunch before 11, so we never arrived late enough to give them a try.  Lucky for us, they offered Easter Brunch one hour earlier, so we were able to finally try their breakfast.  I have to say, I like this location better than East Blvd.  It's roomier and brighter, with tables a bit further spaced apart than the smaller previous location.  They play awesome rock music, too.  The Easter menu was the usual brunch menu.  My husband and I both had the huevos rancheros - mine with scrambled eggs (with cheddar), and his with fried eggs.  I can't begin to describe how good this dish was.  Unlike other places, Cantina serves their huevos rancheros over two cheese quesadillas.  There are black beans underneath the quesadillas, which are then topped with eggs, salsa, Mexican crema, and cotija cheese.  Both of our eggs were cooked perfectly, too.  Their chips and salsa are also phenomenal.  (Yes, we ate a full basket while waiting for our eggs!)  Their chips are really thin and light, and their salsa is fresh, with finely chopped tomatoes and fresh cilantro.  It's medium spicy, in case you were wondering.  It's so good!  Their coffee is also delicious.  It's very strong, and has great flavor.  Service is friendly and efficient here as well.    We'll definitely be back.  I only wish they'd offer earlier brunch all the time.",

We went for the usuals, tacos, Fajitas and the burger. Our waitress was extremely friendly and provided us a great hospitality. There are hardly few waitresses who would care for your well being, she was one of them. Forgot to get her name. The chips and salsa were not the best but medium sized and okay. The food came in without much delay. I got the El Diablo burger and it was a killer! Double patty and super spicy! I tried but couldn't complete the whole burger in one sitting. Overall we had a good experience. And for an upscale restaurant that looked really fashionable it wasn't that expensive. 30 to 40$ for food and drinks for two! Great deal I would say. If you wouldn't mind the wait time, I say check it out!",

I was VERY disappointed in it this time!  The fish was fishy, cold, and the mango sauce or salsa that comes on top was literally like a cold jelly or ice cream topping. It was smooth with the consistency of ketchup and seemed like it was opened from a packet.  Yuck!!!  I will never order again.  The Al Pastor stayed True and was delicious.  Great flavor.  The side salad was also delicious.  The dressing comes mixed in and the amount is perfect.   Good service and chips & salsa were divine.  Love the atmosphere!!!",

This most recent visit prompted me to update my review. I arrived on a Wednesday evening with no wait, great. Chips and salsa were delivered and we ordered a few margarita's. I chose the house, the Casa Margarita, and was told it was premixed. Well, let me tell you, horrible! It is so sweet that I actually sent it back. Decided to go ahead and order a Corona, arrived with no lime, really??? As for the food, I ordered two tacos, chicken and pork, both great. But unfortunately I ordered rice and beans and the rice was so bad I cannot even explain it. And, the fact that they placed the beans in top of the rice, which should never be done, did they know the rice was bad...trying to cover it up? Wrong!!! Overall, there are too many Mexican restaurants that this is not on my go to.",

She's also a tequila lover, so what better way to send her off than to have a fiesta!  Event planning at Cantina 1511 is pretty seamless. All of their options are posted online, and they offer invoice billing and tax exempt, which is so helpful when you work in the nonprofit sector. They even offer gluten free options as part of their event menus!  We used the private room in the back of the restaurant, which was free to use for a lunch event. It is well sectioned off and is truly private, but it is not a separate room so you do hear noise from the restaurant crowd. No biggie to our group!   The food and service were terrific. We had a set menu with four entree options as well as salsa, chips, and guacamole for starters. The guacamole is clearly freshly made in house. It was delicious! I split an enchilada with chicken and spinach as well as tacos carne de asada with a coworker, and both were equally good. I also appreciated that our server did not rush us and kept pace with our group as needed.",

Not a problem. 815 we were still waiting and the manager said she had an idea, she could place a table at the end of the booth, but it was going to be too cramped, then she suggested 2 booths, splitting up the party, which defeated the point of being all together for a birthday party. The manager was nice but the hostesses were very rude and snotty behind our backs as we waited to see if our original reserved tables were ready. We heard the hostesses bad mouthing our entire party, mainly the birthday girl, and were very upset with how they were talking about us with us right there. We addressed the situation to the same manager who was helping us and she apologized and said everyone was on edge because the owner was in that night. Really? I'd hate to see service on a night he wasn't there! About 830 we finally sat down at 2 different booths against what we wanted, but it was late and we were all hungry. You would think that with the problems this far service would be top notch, WRONG! We waited another 10-15 mins before our waitress even came to see what we wanted to drink, then took forever to receive waters, and a bucket of beer. We were right next to the bar, we would have had faster service walking up to the bar individually. We were promised free guacamole for our troubles with the RSVP but that too seemed like it would never come out. Our other table had a little better service then we did from another waiter. Our other table received their food before ours was even ordered, we finally got our food around 915-930, few orders wrong and the birthday girls food was nowhere to be found. Another manager walked by and we had had it at this point. We addressed the food and drink issues and how long we had been there, drinks and correct food came out very quickly after that. But before that our waitress came over and yelled at one in our party who's food came out wrong. She said it was his fault and she asked him 4 different times what he wanted, well why in the hell did it come out wrong then?! The nerve of her to yell at a customer! The original manager came over towards the end of dinner and told the birthday girl she hoped her night got better, laughed at us and walked away. Rudest service hands down. We did get some of our bill comped, but by then it didn't matter, food was cold, served wrong or not served at all, and all by the rudest wait staff in Charlotte. We will never attend Cantina again and plan on making a complaint with the owner and telling all of our experience.",

They're consistently sparkling - the smells as you enter, the grown up staff, the array of menu choices with both traditional Mexican cuisine and Tex-Mex, the unique salsa, the wonderful and varying flavors and presentations all add up to what you've been hoping to find in a fine Mexican restaurant, and just did. The Salmon al Pastor delighted from the grilled pineapple cap through the perfectly not-overcooked salmon tp the delightful pico de gallo. I was allowed a small taste of the Carones Mojo y Ajo; again, the flavors were fresh and original and not at all stereotypical. Sorry - no room for dessert.",

Apparently the selections vary but I believe on that day we had the biggest calamari I have seen in my life, quesadillas, and some kind of meatballs which were pretty tasty. I had the Pan Seared Sea Scallops and Shrimp as my main course and it was delish ... but very salty. I love salt nom nom nom... but those scallops were like pretty much soaked in a vat of salt and then thrown into the pan . The shrimp was delish but the scallops thumbs down . My sister had the chicken tacos and she thought they were pretty tasty as well. We told the waiter it was my sisters birthday and he brought out a piece of a piece of the four milk cake ... obviously they didn't include chocolate milk in this cake so I didn't eat any, but my sister did she said it was alright. She may have enjoyed it more if we weren't so full off of the appetizer, margaritas and main course! Overall I really liked this place and would love to try it again!",

When we arrived we realized that we were going to have to valet because parking is slim, which is normal. The valet was very friendly and organized. We were seated quickly upon entering the restaurant. Our waiter was very nice even though it took him a bit to get our drinks. I ordered a steak burrito and not only was it a ton of food but it was also excellent. It took a while for our waiter to bring our bill, which is understandable because they were busy. All in all I feel like cantina is still very good. But since the change of ownership things seem a little different. I hate to make the comparison but Cantina is starting to feel like a tgi Fridays for me, instead of a local restaurant.",

    "text": "This is the first Mexican restaurant I have been to in Charlotte that was run by Americans and more upscale than most Mexican restaurants. I'll start off by saying the food was delicious! I was impressed with the food and waiter, but not the wait time and cooks.   I ordered a beef chimichanga without beans. After waiting about 40 minutes or longer on our order, our food arrived. I cut into my chimichanga and saw mostly black beans and also realized that the bean juice (whatever you want to call it) was drizzled over it as well. I sent it back, and maybe 4 minutes later received the next one. I did specify after the first one, not to put the bean juice on the second one. When you order something without beans you would think the chef would realized you don't want bean juice on the food either.  At first glance it looked correct, but once I cut into it I saw that it was a chicken chimichanga, NOT beef without beans as I ordered. The waiter never asked if it came out correctly, and fortunately I love chicken so I ate it and didn't complain. I was glad in the long run that it was chicken because it tasted so good. The salsa inside was so fresh and delicious, how could I say anything.   I would go back, but not without a coupon. This is the most expensive Mexican restaurant I have ever been to ($14.75 for mine). The other disappointment was the booth. The seats were so low that is was uncomfortable.   There is patio seating outside, but right beside the street. I don't know if you could hear the cars driving by, but I assume you can. We were there on a weekend evening, and we could see a guy strumming his guitar and singing. The people on the patio seemed to enjoy his company.   My overall experience was frustrating, but the food was really good. I don't think I would go back, just because they seemed to busy to care about the customers.",

The menus were different as well as the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food. We waited for 45 minutes and my fries were ice cold and my black bean burger was extremely bland. It's so not what it use to be and that's so unfortunate. I won't be returning there are way better Mexican restaurants in the area.",

Would have given one star, but our server, Hannah, made our experience much more enjoyable even though none of us enjoyed our dishes. She was very accommodating and anticipated our needs before we needed something. Hannah was funny, charming, and a great server. Unfortunately the food did not match the service.",

Guess I won't be coming back as often.  It's a shame.  Nice people and nice atmosphere.  Many other dishes are good but not so often what I'm in the mood for as the fajitas.",

We were on a mission that night and had been sampling food all over Charlotte, and Cantina was the last stop.  We ordered the tableside Guacamole which was to die for.  Our server whipped it right up and it tasted perfect.  One thing however, we ordered 2 tableside guacamole's and they only prepared 1 tableside.  The other was just brought to us from the kitchen.  Not sure what's up with that.  The Barbacoa was a crowd favorite, I have had this at the other location and it has been on point every time.  Duck Taco's, again a work of art.  3 on a plate and they did not disappoint.  I would highly recommend any of these dishes.  Cantina is Tex Mex at it's finest.  Great location, great service, great food......roll credits.",

    "text": "Cantina 1511 has food ninjas. My tastebuds were unsuspecting and did not see it coming.  I think these may have been the best fajitas I've ever had. That is kind of weird. I don't have fajitas that often because they're kind of labor intensive. Also, they're not really that Mexican-y and kind of safe. Who wants to do all that construction for a stir fry taco?  I had to eat my words which was hard because I was also full from eating those scrumptious fajitas. The ingredients were fresh, starting with chicken, peppers and onions. Making a great meal with fresh ingredients is almost idiot proof. The meat and vegetable were seasoned with something different I can't quite figure, maybe a marinade?, but it wasn't the usual cumin and salt overdose. My dining companion ordered fish tacos and I'm sure I could have eaten those as well.  The restaurant has a chic ambiance and is large. However, the hardwood floors and wooden interior give it a friendly and intimate vibe. So despite the size of the dining area, it's not faceless.  Cantina 1511 isn't striving for the \"authenticity\" of an ordinary Mexican joint and that's a good thing. You won't find the standard numbered menu items, 1 taco, 2 enchiladas or plates swimming in enough cheese, sauce and oil to put you to sleep on the drive home. That's not a diss; I do love a spot where everyone speaks Spanish and serves it up that style. However, Cantina offers a welcome hipper and fresher take on Mexican fare.",

This time I sat at the bar about 1 1/2 hours before closing time.  I asked the bartender what they had in local beers - OMB's Copper on draft and Foothills Hoppyum in the bottle.  Ok.  This wasn't starting out well.  Do they know about the local craft beer craze?  Moving on, I don't remember what I had the last time I was here so I asked the bartender what she would suggest and it was a pork taco where you make your tacos with the  toppings provided on the plate.  I asked if i substitute crunchy corn shells instead of the flour tortillas and she said I could do that.  This was a wonderful recommendation.  The flavors from these tacos danced in my mouth.  Also the best place for the beans and rice were on the taco.  People who have read my reviews know I am not a big beans and rice person because they often lack in flavor but not here.   The salsa was great here as well.  Just the right amount of heat.  The chips could have been better.  It appeared they were from out of a bag because all I received were broken pieces.  But overall, this was a great experience.",

Where they fell short was the quality of the food.  We started with cheese dip, and it had an odd flavor I couldn't identify.  They bring it out with a tealight underneath, but that did nothing for keeping ours from getting cold and clumpy.  Plus, there were onion slices in the queso, making it even more chunky.    The shrimp taco my daughter got was delicious, and she wished she had only gotten those.  The steak tacos were good to me, but she didn't care for them.  I got a chimichanga, and it was covered with that cheese dip and some mysterious black drizzle (probably black bean puree).  The chimi was loaded with rice and beans...and very little chicken.  It was ok, but certainly not special.  My favorite things we had were the chips and salsa and the Quatro Leches cake.  Even the cake changed, though.  I think the cake used to be topped with meringue which was light and toasty, and is now topped with gloppy marshmallow cream which was cloyingly sweet.  I scraped it off and just ate the cake and it was moist and delicious.  I doubt we'll be back, as it is really expensive and you can get better quality food for far less money elsewhere.",

The Tex-mex menu gives you everything from traditional Mexican to crazy updated versions. I am not typically a fajita person, but I love that they include zucchini and mushrooms. A few of my favorite dishes include the vegetarian mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese quesadilla, enchiladas tejanas (which is a beef stew you'll die for), and their salads are to die for.  As for drinks, my favorite is the Pina Margarita because it has no sour mix and the pineapple is so good. A fun fact is that they do not have the margarita flight on the menu, but you can always order it!  There are so many reasons this will always be a favorite.",

Some of our favs include the Thai Chili Glazed Shrimp (tons of flavor, small kick), the Baja Fish, and the 1511 Barbacoa. Neither of us have been huge fans of the Al Pastor - it's a little on the dry side. Also, keep in mind that you can switch up your sides if you're not in the mood for the traditional rice-and-beans.

The ambiance/decor is pretty cool, and definitely a large space to have big groups or a private party.  As with other Yelpers, service here seems to be a pretty big issue.  While we were a relatively large group (8), it was pretty late for a Sunday brunch and there weren't many people in the restaurant, and we had to ask multiple times to just some of the simplest items.  Chips and salsa at the beginning is nice - most Mexican restaurants do it, but not all, so definitely am appreciative when they have that.  The green cilantro-based salsa was pretty good.  The veggie burrito was terrible.  The tortilla tasted weird, the veggies weren't fresh, the entire burrito tasted bland, and I feel like I could've whipped this up in my kitchen and it would've been a million times better than what was served to me.  The overall quality of the food was pretty resounding.  Overall, not a place I'd ever come back to the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

The chips were thin and crispy while the salsa had a strong taste of cilantro (which I loved). The service however was not good at all. They never came and refilled our drinks, chips, or salsa without being asked, even when there was close to nobody in the restaurant. They just really didn't care or do the duties of good waiters. The food didn't impress either, I had a chicken quesadilla that had really weird tasting cheese. The enchiladas were gross looking and dry also. However, the tres leches cake was pretty good and very moist . Overall, I probably wont come back to Cantina 1511 because of personal preferences.",

In coming here I stuck to the shots or basics that you know. If you steer away from known territory you will get your feelings and pockets hurt for wasting money. The baja taco has flavor and the chicken taco needs seasoning. Whether you have the nacho app ( I recommend) or the tacos it's good portions. The decor is fun vibrant and lively. They don't have regular events but they could look into that to liven the place up. Happy eating.",

    "text": "My visit was after the lunch crowd, around 1:35 on a week day and we were sat immediately.    If you've never been, the decor and atmosphere can be classified as Americanized-Mexican.  Plenty of parking available. The ambiance is nice, decor is that of a mix of modern and Pier One Mexican decor.  There's modern American music playing, but it is very possible to have a conversation with people at your table.   Clientele is a good mix of stay at home mothers, old pals catching up for a drink and others there to have business lunches. Most are dressed from casual to business casual. Bar area wasn't busy, 3-4 patrons sitting at the bar. They offer daily drink specials but I didn't partake in this during my visit.   Our waiter was very attentive.  I was there for a quick meet up, to have some appetizers and not having a full fledged meal.  We ordered the Prima Guacamole (made at our table) and were very specific that we did not want anything spicy in our guacamole.  Waiter listened to us and made our guacamole perfectly.  Fresh tomatoes and lots of lime and a smidge of cilantro - just how I like it.  Chips were warm and had perfect salt seasoning - not too much, not too little.   We also ordered the Chicken empanadas off of the appetizer section.  This includes 4 triangle empanadas filled with  cheese, chicken and Pico de Gallo.  Perfect serving for two people. The plate was garnished well with a bed of lettuce and bits of tomatoes for the empanadas to lay in, empanadas were drizzled lightly with chipotle ranch and serve with side of guacamole and sour cream (not spicy). These empanadas were flavorful and served at perfect temperature!   We then shared a Cuatro Leches Cake to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Cuatro leches is a cake with four types of milk poured over it.   It is topped with a sugar-merengue, garnished with mint leaves.  It was DEVINE but very rich for just one person to have, in my opinion.  We shared this cuatro leches cake and between the both of us were unable to finish it.    We enjoyed our visit to Cantina but felt a rushed at the end, as our waiter brought our bill at the same time as our dessert.  Our total visit was less than a hour long, there were lots of open tables and no one waiting to be seated so I thought perhaps it was shift change.",

I have been here at least 4 times and never found anything I loved. I have tried the Enchiladas Tejana, Enchilada Suiza, Carne Asada Quesadilla, and the Tortilla soup. Of those I would only ever order the Tortilla soup again. The only meal that I particularly didn't like was the carne asada quesadilla, it was extremely greasy and reminded me of a delivery pizza with steak - cheap cheese and grease. There wasn't anything wrong with the other meals, but they weren't great, mostly forgettable.",

The queso is an absolute must when ordering appetizers. The chips are freshly done and so tortillas with the queso is heavenly. I order the grilled mushroom and spinach quesadilla every time I go and, in my opinion, one of the best items on the menu. The drinks were delicious. I believe my friend and I both ordered the disco lemonade and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else.",

I think they revamped they're menu since I was there last because I think there were way more taco options than before. I got the Angry Bird (Buffalo chicken) and the That Chili glazed shrimp tacos. Both were fantastic. I might have liked the shrimp one slightly more, but it's hard to pick one.   We went for lunch and out was pretty crowded. The service wasn't the fastest, but that's understandable considering how crowded it was.   I'll definitely be back again in the future!",

The service was fast and helpful. We had someone who can't eat cheese and the waiter was very patient with helping the person order a burger to his liking.   I was mixed on if this would be a great place for food based on the reviews I read. I never went to this restaurant when it was on East blvd so I can not compare it to that.   For my first time I was pleased with the food! I ordered the 5 cheese queso and the spinach chicken enchiladas with the white sauce. The main dish was pretty good! The consistency was perfect and really good flavor. Now the queso.. I was slightly disappointed. It is difficult to disappoint me with cheese! I thought it was slightly bland. I also thought it tasted like cheese you would get at a fondue place and I'm not the biggest fan of that. I shared with others and they loved it! So it's all about preference. I was not paying for my meal and I would've been disappointed if I would've spent $9.75 of my own money on the queso. I put it in my rice though and it was good!   Other people at my table got burritos. I have NEVER seen a burrito as big as these!! They could last you 2-3 meals probably!   Overall, the atmosphere was great, you get free chips and delicious salsa, and the food good! I would probably go back.",

And the short rib and shrimp tacos  are also faves.  The manager, Vince, is awesome!  We had a special dietary request that he bent over backward to accommodate.  He truly understands what good customer service is all about.  We look forward to our \"Cantina 1511 Night\" every week!",

Its like they put it \"An Evolution of Authentic Mexican Food.\" You can tell the owners and chefs take pride in their ingredients and cooking style. I also like the fact they support local farmers and make their own cheese and tortillas. Atmosphere is nice, can get a little packed on certain nights. The South Charlotte location is a little more \"posh\" and larger...but food is superb at both. Try the soft tacos...can't go wrong. Lots of choices for spirits.   Only reason I did not give them 5 stars is for one simple fact. I have been going here for a while now, and everytime I leave a comment about not having fried ice cream on the dessert menu. They keep telling me it is messy for the deep fryers.....come on think of something!",

I like how they make the gauc in front of you and endless chips are always good.  The only thing I didn't like was the decor was a little bit dreary and I agree with Faith about the mildew rag smell.  All in all, it was better than average",

The ambiance screams modern mexico with an American twist. From the outside walking in, Good luck finding parking, I had to park on the street because parking is limited. Luckily the neighborhood is a pretty good one so I had no problem with that. I had the \"Enchiladas de Pollo\" which was pretty damn good to me (it was plated nicely/ could of been better but I'm not picky about that). Yes, it was on the cheesy side but I like cheese. The chicken was a little dry, that's were all that cheese came into play. I think they would of had a 5-star dish on their hands if they brined the chicken first and then grilled it. Overall I was happy with my dish. The dinner party I was with had the some of the dishes pictured, 1. Chimichanga (looked F'n Delicious) 2. Ancho Chicken Quesadillas (the chicken chunks were actually pretty big). No one complained about their food but I can say the prices were moderately higher than your average Mexican restaurant, that would be a major downfall for me to go back to Cantina on a regular basis. If your ever in Charlotte of course I would inform you to check out this place for any special occasion. Just make sure your ready to spend a little more on Mexican food.",

When they were brought out she found something in her taco. It wasn't a hair but it looked like a bristle from a brush. Then I got a bone in my taco. The GM was fantastic and came right over and took care of our meal for us after apologizing a million times. Once would have been enough but he really wanted us to be happy. That is great customer service. I've eaten here a million times before and this is the only time I've ever had a problem but it was quickly corrected by them. They took our plates back and replaced our meals then kindly picked up our check. I will definitely go back again.",

The server was extremely helpful with what he recommended, because I ordered exactly both recommendations for the appetizer and entree. They were both great. The appetizer was the Queso Fundido I think, which looked like a small pizza. Very cheesy. The entree was Barbacoa del Puerco, which was awesome. It came with tortillas where I could wrap shredded pork with other toppings such as beans, guacamole, rice, pico de gallo, cheeses, and lettuce.  YUM YUM YUM. Service was also excellent.",

I haven't been in a couple months but use to frequent this place for lunch when I went to school in the area. I would usually get their small Mexican chopped salad and it was huge, more than enough for one person. It also had a good variety of veggies on it, chick peas, jicama, avocado, peppers, onion and tomatoes. I'd usually add shrimp or chicken to it for my protein as well. I've also had their tacos with shrimp which are very tasty. They bring fresh chips and salsa to your table when you arrive and if you order the guacamole they'll prepare it tableside for you. Also be sure to try one of their Mojitos.;-)",

The food seems to be very 'visitor friendly'.  It is as one would expect for TexMex, not a traditional enchilada but also not bold or daring in its ingredient selection or spices.    Service was adequate as it was not very busy around 1 PM on a Saturday. We were seated in the front of the restaurant closest to the road.  I'm not sure if the guys at the table next to us just had large lungs with voices that carried or if the room could have used some sound barriers because I could hear their conversation better than our own!",

We were told by the manager that the remaining balance of $17 was not redeemable and we would lose it.  Why couldn't they just give us another gift certificate for the balance???  The manager told us \"she just works here and that's the way it is\".  I'm not sure why they can't join the rest of the world and use gift cards, but it left a bad taste in our mouths and we may not return.",

Her burrito was huge, but she only eat a few bites, It just wasn't good. i had the traditional enchiladas and they were slightly more edible, however, we wouldn't go back for either dish. The beans were like a bad bean soup, the rice didn't have much taste (other than the peas mixed in),   The atmosphere was great and the server was very attentive and i really wanted to like the place, but i can't say i'll be back.",

I think the menu is similar or nearly identical, but this time we had some items we'd never had before and it was all absolutely fabulous. I had not been expecting it. The appetizer we ordered was something about Pig Wings and it was out of this world. The grilled and glazed pork pieces were exceedingly tender, flavorful and rich. The richness was gorgeously balanced by the acidity of the slaw and pickled red onions. Then I had their fish of the day (mahi mahi) cooked in a unique Spanish style casserole with garlic, pine nuts artichokes and Spanish sweet potato. Incredible. My husband loved his roasted carnitas (pork).  Best food in a LONG time, for a great price",

The atmosphere is very nice--a little more upscale than your standard Mexican place. The service was friendly and professional--I was with a picky diner and they had no problems customizing her order. The food was obviously great, and I felt the prices were pretty good--dinner for two was about thirty bucks (without alcohol).   I had the Barbacoa, and everything about it was excellent.

Honestly, if I didn't know better I would think I was at On the Border. It was like I was eating Mexican cafeteria food. Try Bakersfield or Sabore if you're wanting a South of the Border vibe. Babalu is pretty good too. Cantina needs to step it back up.",

My only tick to 4 v. 5 stars was the taste of each offering seemed close in flavor to the other offerings we ordered.  All the food was very good and pleasantly presented.

Not sure if it's a regular concept, but it does save money. (Not that I eat at either of those places, but I am familiar. ;)) They make the at the table guacamole which was really tasty and fresh. I'm not sure if this is a chain, but I'm almost certain it's not the owners first restaurant because it was run efficiently and well. They have Sunday Ticket so you can see the games, and plenty of TV's which was great. Whether you're with a group or just a partner, this is a great spot. Lots of drink options as well, the margaritas were good, and their low quality tequila is still 100% agave. As for quality, it's absolutely worth the price. Waitress was attentive and nice, I'd recommend the restaurant.",

    "text": "My wife & I met some friends here for dinner tonight & we've been to this location a handful of times.   I was expecting a wait, given the weekend & this place is usually packed. The couple we were meeting got there before us & had already put in for the table. We waited around 35-40 minutes or so & were then sat. That's typical...  We sat at our table for around 20 minutes before anyone even came by our table. Once the waiter did reach our table we were greeted with a hyped up waiter who spoke so fast you couldn't understand what he was saying & he kept using douchey phrases like \"chip situation\", \"hydration station\" & so on.   We waited an additional 15 min to place our order & shortly after receiving our drinks, the food arrived. Luckily it was on point, with one exception. One of our friends ordered the small order of nachos, but got the large order & was assured she wouldn't be charged for the large order... She was.   Sparse drink refills, and persistent asking for more water was met with lackluster service & more douchey word play. The waiter nearly hit one of our friends with the water pitcher. Once or twice, it's cute & all... But this was over the top. We got a beer we didn't order, and was told it was a \"gift\" to go along with our other beers. I digress.   So to sum it up: the food was great as usual, but I'm not sure it's worth the wait & the poor service. We'll probably be back at some point, but likely for take out.",

    "text": "I've been a Cantina fan at both locations, but I prefer the East Blvd. location as it has more character. The Ballantyne location is pretty cookie cutter in terms of a strip mall location. This review is for the East Blvd. location.  My Mom was in town, and with one meal a couple of years ago I've made her a Cantina fan as well. She insists on Cantina at least once every time she visits. No problem here. :P  The day we visited was for lunch on either 3/31 or 4/1, I can't remember. Must always for me: table-side guac and the Marco Polo Tacos. I really do want to try different entrees, but every time I do, I wish I ordered those darn tacos. I'm sold on them.   We ordered the table-side guac, I ordered the Marco Polo Tacos, and my mom ordered the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla. The guac, as usual, was super fresh, bright with the lime and spices. My tacos were amazing as expected, and plated enticingly (first time I've seen their new plating for these). The chopped salad with the tacos is always so good, very fresh and a welcome change from the regular side salad you get with any meal at different restaurants. My mom loved her quesadilla.   The one thing I wasn't that happy with was the blood orange margarita. It almost had the taste of a machine margarita, and definitely had way too much mixer. It would be nice to see these with real blood oranges shining through in the winter/early spring as they are in season.  Our service was very good. Our waitress checked on us often, offered suggestions and recommendations, and was very friendly.  Please, Cantina 1511 - don't lose the atmosphere on the move to Park Road Shopping Center. :( Don't become cold like the Ballantyne location. :(",

To start, it does not matter what time of day I have visited or how many tables were filled, it takes a minimum of 30 minutes to get your food. I even ordered everything as soon as the waiter came to my table and still, 35 minutes later my main course was served.   The cheese enchilada dinner if served in the iron skillet which is how most of their dishes are served taste like iron. It has absorbed the flavor of the metal and definitely does not taste good. When asked to have cheese enchiladas served on a plate, the cheese was cold and the portion was significantly smaller and again, lacked in flavor and taste.  Pros - great location, great chips and salsa and good drinks.  Cons - I have yet visit and be in and out in less than 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Two of three times I have visited the waitstaff has been new, did not know the menu and did not seem to be fully trained or engaged.",

The bar staff was very slow to recognize me while the bartender and manager gossiped at end of bar.   The meal came out quickly. If you want bang for the buck come here because the portion size was humongous. The meal overall was a sloppy success, I enjoyed the flavor and textures on par with any other Mexican joint.

I got the ribs - you could have made shoes from the leather; they added two tablespoons of coleslaw, a tablespoon of corn, and a scoop of potato salad, and called it something Mexican.  They noticed I left two of the three charred ribs on the plate when I asked for the check ($25,00 with a draft beer to wash away the taste) and they asked if I wanted a doggy-bag.

    "text": "Normally this restaurant is fine - good food, good customer service, etc. No complaints. However, after last night, I am NEVER eating at Cantina 1511 ever again. Consider this review a public service announcement: do not go to this restaurant if you a) have any nut allergies or b) care about customer service at all.  Last night my friend, who is very allergic to nuts, went to Cantina for dinner and ordered the enchiladas. She ate her entire meal before realizing she didn't feel well. Her throat started itching and her lips swelled up as if she were having an allergic reaction. She called the waiter over and asked if the enchiladas contained nuts and the waiter said he didn't think so, he thought the only dishes with nuts were the desserts, but he would ask the chef to be sure. After asking the chef, the waiter informed my friend that the only dishes with nuts were indeed the desserts and a couple of salads, but that both were prepared on the opposite side of the kitchen from where her dish was prepared. My friend was fairly certain she was having an allergic reaction, though, so the manager was called over. The manager then told her that the enchilada sauce contains nuts and that it was her responsibility to ask if the dish has nuts. That is simply ridiculous. What Mexican dish has nuts?? And if one does, it should be stated on the menu! Also, even if my friend had asked the waiter if the dish contained nuts, neither he nor the chef would have known the answer! Lastly, all else aside, the customer is always right. It is absurd for the management to blame my friend for something that was definitely the restaurant's fault. The situation could have been exponentially worse and Cantina could have faced a serious lawsuit. I am thoroughly disappointed with the way management handled this situation (he made her pay for the meal and basically berated her experience) and it goes without saying that I will never return to Cantina 1511.   UPDATED: An employee from Cantina responded to this review and was extremely courteous and apologetic. He expressed genuine concern and assured me that management would be notified. He also promised this would never happen again. While I hate the situation happened, I am thoroughly grateful for the restaurant's response. Thank you Cantina!! Maybe I'll be back after all :)",

    "text": "Birthday dinner with a party of 10 meant that we got to sit right in the middle of the restaurant, since we were too many for the octagon fish bowl room that's right by the hostess stand.   Some of our party was straggling, so we sat and ordered our drinks.  I'd been warned that the margaritas were pricey, so I opted for the orange-raspberry sangria, since I was only drinking with dinner and then being the DD for the bar crawl afterwards.  What a disappointment.  Not only did it not taste like orange or raspberry (more like mango?) but it also didn't take anything like wine or anything alcoholic for that matter, and not in a \"wow that goes down so easy because I can't taste the alcohol\" kind of way.   I tried my friend's red sangria, and it was worse - it tasted off, not just bad, but as if the wine in it had gone bad.  Once the stragglers arrived, pitchers of margaritas were ordered, and I got to try one - all sour mix.  Did that thing even have tequila in it?  Seriously, for those prices, I would expect a buzz, and I did not get it.    Fortunately the tableside guacamole was delicious.  Not sure why they can charge more at these places for you to see them make it in front of you - except that does prove that they're starting with fresh avocados, which I imagine is the main source of the expense.  They got it right - good balance of salt, jalapenos, tomatoes, and onions.  Not as good as mine, but best I've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The cheese dip was not as good  - too chunky for my taste, as if all the cheese hadn't melted thoroughly enough or properly (like when you try to melt low fat cheese).  The salsas had great flavor, as did the chips, which were already salted (good for me, but bad for your blood pressure).  Trying to be good, I opted for the veggie enchiladas.  Though not what I expected based on the description, they were good, and I don't even like corn, which is mostly what they tasted like to me.  There was zucchini was diced to be about the size of the corn, so really all I tasted was the corn and the sauces on top.   Both the green and the red were delicious.  The rice was blah, but the beans were quite nice.    The server did an excellent job of separating out our checks, and didn't even include the usual automatic 18% gratuity, but you could tell that we weren't her favorite table.  She kept coming back every few minutes at the beginning asking if we were ready to order when our full party hadn't arrived, even when we told her that we'd wait for them.  And the other staff was aggressively removing stuff from the table, as soon as you put your fork down or you started getting air from the bottom of your beverage.  Also, in the process of clearing the chips and salsa, the server spilled almost an entire dish on John's sleeve, and didn't even flinch!  The whole thing made the dinner feel frantic, not enjoyable.  All in all, I would say go if you're craving some good guacamole and a Mexican beer, but eat before or after at somewhere where you get more value.",

    "text": "There is absolutely no resisting a bowl full of warm, crispy tortilla chips and fresh homemade salsa when you sit down at this spot.  No. Resisting.  Trust me, I've tried.  IMPOSSIBLE.  And the guac that they make at the table? Insanity.  I'm all about fresh ingredients, and it doesn't get much fresher than that.  The drinks are yum-tastic also (can't go wrong with a marg at a place like this).  Lunch selections are great, and the service has always been fantastic there!  Everything I've ever had on the menu has been of superb quality and very very very very very very verrrrrry tasty.  ...that is, if I can actually fit any lunch or dinner into my stomach after eating all of the chips. FREE REFILLS, FTW!  The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because of parking.  Be prepared to walk there if you get there during busy lunch or dinner hours.  And don't park at Starbucks, you WILL get towed.",

    "text": "Came to Cantina Sunday night to satisfy my craving for some good ol' Mexican food. I was NOT disappointed. From the minute we sat down we knew it was a good decision; at 930 on a Sunday night this place still had a good crowd, which I can't say I've seen at any other restaurant around, given they are actually open on Sunday nights.   I agree with pretty much everyone else's review about the prices - more than you'd probably want to spend  for dinner, but worth it all at the same time. And if you are having a hard time parting with your cash just order a patron margarita and it will suddenly, rapidly, get easier to cough up the dough.   I won't repeat what's already been said, but I will second everything Jason L. says about the two kinds of salsa you are presented with when you sit down. Our server could tell we were hungry and she replenished our salsas without us even having to ask. Maybe she was just afraid we'd bite her arm off given the speed we were eating at, but either way, she knew service.   I asked for the tofu & veg fajitas, and then my fiancee ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas and I couldn't take it anymore - I switched my order to the chicken & shrimp fajitas (yes, I am struggling and teetering on the line of vegetarianism and carnivorism - and I had to give in here). I was so happy when my food came out - everything looked so fresh and juicy! (note: this statement may be influenced by the fact that the only other place I've ordered a fajita from in the last 3 years was Chili's, and yech, not so good there). But anyway, the fajitas were delicious! And very filling. Save this place for a special occassion if you are worried about the prices, but definitely go!  PS - visit their website and turn up the sound, and tell me you didn't shake it.",

    "text": "ZERO STARS.  I actually ACTUALLY cannot comprehend how this place has an average of FOUR STARS, barring fake reviews.  This is my third time going... and you know what, I'll admit it, SHAME ON ME.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  But along with that admission, here comes my scathing review, broken down into paragraphs for easy reference (ordered from good to bad to ugly):  SERVICE no complaints. hostess was friendly, promptly seated, table service was perfectly and absolutely a-ok.  AMBIENCE I will have to disagree with the yelper below who said: \"This isn't your hole in the wall Mexican restaurant... definitely a little fancier and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.\"  I would much prefer a hole in the wall restaurant than a chain restaurant with fabricated pieces of flair... the only thing \"fancier\" about this place are the prices.   Another downside: the live \"music.\"  The first time I was assaulted by the live music was my first time at Cantina for brunch.  We were on the patio and the speakers/musician were literally 5 feet away.  What makes a mediocre breakfast burrito worse? A too-loud, too-close, too-American Idol rendition of Yellow by Coldplay.  Tonight was no better.  We were seated inside, but unfortunately, the musician was set up indoors, as well.  And again, the music was too-loud, too-close, and just not really... good.  But, to make matters worse, mariachi music was blaring from the restaurant speakers, competing with the live music.  What the actual hell.  Could nobody else hear what was happening?  FOOD oh boy, here we go.  Like I mentioned before, I've been here three times.  Each time I told myself two things: (1) the chips and salsa are really good; and (2) I just ordered the wrong thing.  At this point, I've tried enough things to know that someone (everyone?) in the kitchen does not know what's going on.  As referenced under AMBIENCE, my first time here was for brunch.  I got to try the breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros.  How bland and unimpressive both these dishes were... I feel that someone has to be trying to make the food taste bad for these things to taste as bad as they did.  Second time was for lunch: some \"mexican\" salad and quesadilla.  Again, how someone was able to take the ingredients and make them taste this bad is incomprehensible.  How do you make a quesadilla taste bad? I'm actually asking.  What do you have to do to a tortilla and melted cheese to make it taste bad?  I want to know so I can do this in the future for someone I HATE.  final nail in coffin: dinner tonight.  We got a pitcher of house margs and ordered an assortment of tacos.  six in total: shrimp, fried shrimp, duck, \"catch of the day,\" chicken, and brisket.  Margs: too sweet and too weak.  On to the bulk of my complaint... the food was disgusting and certainly not fresh.  As soon as our plates were set down, we were both overwhelmed by a wave of rank-ass fish odor.  Ok, fine, whatever, we were still going to give them a fair tasting.  I'm such an inner fatkid and even I couldn't finish my food.  The shrimp, chicken, and brisket were edible.  EDIBLE.  no more, no less.  merely. edible.  The duck made my friend gag -- I watched as a grown man struggled not to barf in the middle of a restaurant.  It was overly gamey and did not belong in a taco (his words: \"it tasted like the duck was fed poop its whole life\").  The \"catch of the day\" could not have been less fresh.  It was mushy, fishy, and tasteless -- 1.5 bites were had... between the both of us... I had to spit out half my bite.   needless to say, we barely touched our entrees and what was eaten was a struggle to swallow.  I am flabbergasted as to how this restaurant is still in business.  with FOUR STARS.  I get that Charlotte isn't known for its mexican food, but... what? WHAT?!   TL;DR -- after giving this place more than a fair chance, I made a pinky promise tonight to never ever EVER come here again.  sure, it's convenient.  sure, they have good chips and salsa.  but, no. just NO.",

They've also upped their prices-granted the menu has changed, but add'l $3-$5 per entree?! Seriously?? I've been going to other spots(reviews to follow) that are less pricey and just as delicious, if not better.   I LOVE THEIR NACHOS!!! I should probably sample more of the food before writing a review, but who cares. Go for the nachos. The \"appetizer\" portion is enough to feed two people and have leftovers(unless you're some big ol hungryman type). Their mojitos and margeritas are the ish too.  Drinks in general are good, but catch a special, even if you have money to waste, a drink special tastes much better than regular priced booze anyday! Ask for Johan to be your server. My spicy, hot latin friend with the perfect teeth and best jiggalo accent you'll EVER here. He's awesome and the nicest guy ever. And who DOESN'T want to be served by someone beautiful that makes you think you're on vacation in S. America??(even straight guys and gay girls like me like it so ha!)",

    "text": "Forget slow, no matter what time of day, or the weather. This place is super popular.    But the servers are cheery and down to earth and just after your drinks arrive the busboy will set a fresh warm bowl of chips and cool salsa on the table.  Two salsas actually.  The red salsa (salsa roja) has punch.  You can taste an exciting splash of fresh individual flavors instead of the usual tomato-onion-lemon.  And it also comes with a spicy green salsa (salsa de tomatillo aka salsa verde) that has a great spicy kick.    We ordered the ground beef tacos and the waitress didn't flinch when I asked for things like \"no onions\" and \"no sour cream\" and they came to our table perfectly.  I like it when both the servers and the cooks pay attention.  Needless to say the tacos were impeccable.  Flavorful and fresh.  They came with a side of cilantro rice with a few beans as garnish.  I could say it was slightly overcooked, but it was a nice alternative to the usual spoonful of plain beans and rice.    They have more tequilas than your average saloon!   An impressive list of martinis, margaritas and enough tequilas for several rounds of shots without using the same tequila twice.  Just remember the old saying \"One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor...\" before ordering too many.  At $22 for lunch and all we had were tacos and diet cokes, it was a little high, but more of a unique experience than I expected and well worth the investment.  I'll save Cantina for special occasions, especially for dinner, because I know when I go to Cantina I'll have a great time in an upscale atmosphere and there are plenty of things to try on the menu.  I  have to agree with Tony C's review, it's the Banana Republic / Club Monaco of Mexican restaurants. You won't be out of place dressing up to dine here.  But they are very consistent and this is a great date spot.",

I'd recommend getting a pitcher for your table. While every table gets chips and two kinds of salsa, I'd also suggest ordering the guacamole.

    "text": "The Good: Meh....wasn't impressed BUT wasn't dissapointed either.  For ME (Me being a Texan and loving all things mexican food related) it was just ok.  I ordered the fish tacos (which were good..not GREAT but good) and I was happy with them. Everyone else loved their food as well and it all came out Hot!!!!  Big plus for food served HOT.  Loved the music playing out in the patio area. We were dancing at our table.  Always fun....  The Ok: Margarita that was supposed to be top shelf and their best one...tasted like a smoothie sin taquilla. Husband not happy but is too kind to send it back.    I ordered i guess you could call it the Skinny Girl Margarita and it tasted like concentrated lemon juice.  No bueno.  Pino Grio please!!  (yummy as always)   The What the??: Table made quacomole was the ONLY dissapointment.  I mean huge let down...  I love quac...i could swim in a tub of quac...I would have quac everday of my life..My Hubs who hated quac before he met me tasted mine- is now a quac LOVER.  They put hot sauce in it...hot suace.  Hot. Sauce??  No.  I mean some folks love it that way but if I would have seen her making it, I would have jumped up to save the qreen goodness from being tainted w/ the hot sauce.  And again...some and MOST people love it this way but I do not.  And it could have been jalapenos or something but it was something that was amiss...so I will just blame it on mr. hot sauce.  :)  Overall...I like this place and will def be back!  (with my own avacados and fixings for the quac)..LOL!!  Just teasing.",

The atmosphere is lively and exciting, great full bar, and incredible cantina Mexican dishes. LOVE the salmon and the mango salsa - I want to buy it by the carton!  Only con: parking is consistently a terrible experience. The valet is fine and helpful but on busy nights it's tempting to just scurry off to another place and avoid the whole mess.",

I ordered the carne asada tacos which were room temperature and bland when they were brought out. I asked the waiter for cheese for that tacos and later found out I was charged $1.00 for the cheese. I thought cheese was a required taco topping but I guess not at Cantina 1511. Pros were that the mimosa I ordered was made well and the service was fairly quick.",

    "text": "Cantina 1511 is great! Definitely check it out. The food is a bit higher priced that your average Mexican eatery but the quality of the food is higher as well... and Cantina is more Tex-Mex actually. The guacamole is fresh and fashioned up table side when you order. I'm a big fan of this as it makes the guacamole smoother and your server asks you your heat preference - great for spice lovers like myself!  I had a crab meat quesadilla and side salad on one on my latest ventures and both were phenominal. Highly recommended. The margaritas are quite tasty as well, never too sour, and you have a vast menu to choose from, all in different styles and flavors. I tend to make friends with margaritas quite easily so eventually, I'm sure I will befriend them all. Multiple times.   This joint gets busy busy, especially at night, so reservations are recommended here.",

The salsa is some of the best I've had in Charlotte and being from Southern AZ this is a big deal.  My mixed feelings come from the service. I have yet to have good service at Cantina 1511. The waitstaff seems confused by the menu, today my server asked ME questions about the menu. When I am there I feel like I am always waiting for something.   It is a shame because the food is really good and I love the atmosphere but if I am going to be paying $15 bucks for tacos I expect the service to be worth it.",

    "text": "I've been here many times, but after my most recent meal the other night I figured it's about dang time I write a review.  Simply put, this place is great.  If you like guacamole, this is the place for you.  They make it at the table while you watch, and you can have it seasoned to your taste.  It's a bit pricey to get the guacamole, but it's pretty delicious.  Just be prepared because you'll get a LOT of guac.  If you don't like the guacamole, you will probably be pretty satisfied with the complimentary salsa.    If you like tequila, you have come to the right place.  There are plenty of different types and there is a good variety of margaritas.  I am more of a beer man, myself.  There aren't a lot of drafts to choose from, but they have Dos Equis Amber and when I'm eating Mexican food that is good enough for me.  So what really inspired me to write this review was the dish I had the other night, the barbacoa de puerco.  I cannot believe I've been to Cantina so many times without trying this thing but it was amazing.  The dish consisted of slow cooked, shredded pork with pico, guacamole, and charro beans and rice.  The pork was tender, juicy, flavorful, and delicious.  It came with flour tortillas to load up with the meat and sides.  It possibly the best Mexican meal I've had.    If you aren't interested in the barbacoa, I'd recommend to get some tacos.  There are about 10 different types so there's something for everyone.    In conclusion, if you like Mexican food you need to go here.  Be sure to make a reservation if you're going on Friday or Saturday.  If you don't, you will likely be waiting for a while.  Standing around waiting for 45 minutes watching the waiters carry around the delicious looking and wonderful smelling hot plates is a torturous experience.",

My favorite part was the beautiful private room we used. It was in the corner of the restaurant housed by large barn doors. The space was colorful and very roomy. We had a very nice server who attended to our needs very well. The menu we were given was So yummy. Everyone liked their meal. They came out fresh and hot. I quite enjoyed the experience and plan on coming back. If you are hosting a party, I recommend having it at cantina 1511! My organization is a state agency and we are tax exempt and cantina 1511 worked with us very well! They even let us bring in an outside cake which was very kind!",

I was quickly greeted by one of the bartenders who offered water and the wine list. I then had a pleasant time drinking some Chardonnay and eating some chips and salsa while perusing the menu. My goal was to eventually take out my dinner so my goal was to determine what would travel well. The two bartenders \"tag-teamed\" and so I was well taken care of. When asked about the different between the tortilla soup and the pozole verde the bartender offered me a sample of the soup. Nice. I chose the tortilla soup and a \"small\" chopped salad (was plenty.) I'll have to say that the tortilla soup is exceptionally good plus they packed the tortilla strips and cheese in a separate container so I could add them when I got home.  Well done Cantina 1511.",

Although I live much closer to the uptown location, we thought this one would be more convenient in terms of parking. As soon as I walked in the door, I had to make the group of three hostesses speak, but the lady behind the counter was much more welcoming. Waitress was friendly enough, but I must say that NO ONE seemed to be genuinely welcoming nor appreciative of our patronage.  To top it off, the quesadillas were NOT good. Of course, could be a preference thing, but the jalapeno bacon tasted more like ham-rubbery and overcooked. Chips and guac were literally the only things worth it. My fiance said that his calamari and low country tacos were mediocre at best. The pina margarita also tasted like a glass of lemon juice.  As we walked out, no one thanked us or even acknowldged us. Maybe the uptown location is just better? Just seemed like the people have created their own little world at this Park Rd. location, and do not take kindly to \"outsiders\" coming into it. Really quite disgusting when you consider their attitudes. Would NEVER return. Will continue to visit 1900 at Elizabeth or make the trek to Chuy's.",

Queso is pretty on point, but only if you like Parmesan cheese. Guac is made in front of you. If you like spicy I recommend getting the hot because the medium is not spicy at all.  Margaritas could be stronger.",

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were informed that our reservation would not be honored. Since it is one of our kids' favorite restaurants, we decided to give them another chance last week.  It had to be one of the worst experiences we've ever had in a restaurant.  So many things went wrong! The poor waitress was untrained and in over her head.  It took 45 minutes for one of our party to get the correct drink.  Most of the food was either cold, wrong or not very good! When the manager came over to check on us, we listed our complaints.  He gave us his card, with the promise of a free appetizer.  I stuck it in my wallet along with the one from the last time...doubt we'll go back.",

So I asked for new silverware and a new wine glass. I ordered soup as an appetizer and the spoon that came with it was dirty too. I took it to the bathroom and washed it because that's the only way I could assure that it's actually CLEAN! I barely ate any of my soup and I requested the tab and left. I cannot eat in a place that does not seem clean and sanitary, that is a big issue for me. The management here really needs to look into this and make some implementations to ensure that their dishes and silverware are actually getting cleaned properly. I will not be returning.",

I ordered the chimichanga with steak and it was just okay, kinda heavy on the rice and beans and not much else. My friends ordered the tostada salad and the avocado hamburger, both of which seemed to be hits. Overall, it was an average experience with average food. There are other options nearby that I enjoy a little more, so I'm definitely not tripping over myself to go back anytime soon.",

This was the place that showed me that avocados really are amazing.   They consistently deliver delicious dishes regardless of what I've ordered. Always go for tableside guacamole, or if you're feeling cheesy: the queso is tasty as well.   Service is pretty consistent regardless of how busy it gets. It might just take a little longer when it's packed... like any restaurant.   My usual order is either an ancho chicken burrito or 2 tacos with rice and beans or the chopped salad. Favorite tacos include: al pastor, ancho pollo, and crispy shrimp BLT. You cannot go wrong with ancho pollo, I promise!",

The first time I went, I ordered the chopped salad with salmon. It had mixed salad greens, jicama, red onions, garbanzo beens, cucumber, cotija cheese, cucumber, and avocado with the dressing on the side.  The salad was perfection.  The second time I went I ordered the Western Cobb salad. It had chopped romaine, cucumbers, roasted corn, black bean salsa, jalapeno bacon, hand cut tortilla strips, avocado, cotija cheese and chipotle ranch on the side. It was amazing. They don't cut you short on the chicken. I don't think I've ever finished an entire salad at a restaurant. There wasn't a drop left.",

    "text": "While certainly one of your more upscale Mexican restaurants in town, Cantina 1511 has lived up to my expectations on a regular basis and has become a regular spot for me when I need to get my fix of imported draft beer, chips and guacamole, or a nice margarita.  I've been here quite a few times and have had brunch, dinner, and even takeout (Pro Tip: use the takeout spot right in front of the restaurant to make a speedy getaway). Some of my favorite dishes include the guacamole which they mix fresh by the table side, the chicken tortilla soup, and any selection of the tacos (Marco Polo is always a solid choice). They also have a fun brunch menu I suggest checking out if you are interested, which is impressive considering all of the competition close by. The space is large and can accommodate both large and small parties and I would recommend reservations during peak dinner times.  I will admit that service here can be hit or miss from time to time. During my most recent experience, my wife and I went to sit on their patio to enjoy the nice weather with a beer and some guac. I realize it was towards the end of the day on a Sunday, however our waiter often went MIA and seemed like he couldn't care less about us. This was an abnormal experience for us here, so I didn't penalize my overall score. I do plan to be back and hope to try more of their menu in the future.",

This use to be my go to spot with friends on the weekend and to bring out of town guests, however something has changed since they moved. I feel like they are becoming more of a chain restaurant.   The service lately has been hit or miss, but mostly miss. Last time we were there (about a month ago) we had to ask for our waiter multiple times. But the worst part was the food. The menu hasn't changed (from the looks of it), but my husband and I order the SAME thing every time and something has changed. We get the  two taco combo: Ancho Polo and Marco Polo. The last time we ordered it the tacos were either not what we ordered or they changed the way they make the tacos. It tasted like a load of coleslaw on them. And not flavorful. They just didn't taste the same. We asked our server if they changed the ingredients, but she didn't know. Plus, the black beans are now brown pinto beans. Mehhh.   Not sure what's up with Cantina lately, but we tried Paco's a few weeks ago and fell in love. I hope Cantina can step it up again.",

Definitely way too dry for \"creamy\" chicken. I also tried to use a teachers discount which they eventually accepted but said that it would not be valid in the future. If you want to end a coupon that's fine but just end it! Don't leave it up on my employee app then tell me it's just supposed to be just for a kid's back to school special and threaten to not accept it. It was specifically for the park road location...

The smell was so good when I walked in and I knew from looking around what I was going to get.  There comes a time in a mans life where he wants a great flavor and value.  The fajitas even had the peppers cooked just right and I don't even like peppers.  The only thing I can think of that kept me from giving a solid 5 stars would be the price.  It's a bit too pricey for what you get but others are saying this is more upscale.  I guess that's what they were going for but it's not really much more upscale than I'm used to.  Maybe I'm missing something.  The atmosphere is really welcoming and they have quick service.  The decor is newer and they have comfortable seating all around.  It was too cold to sit outside but I would have enjoyed that had it been a little warmer.  I will say this for some reason they seem to be a little slower if you are only ordering take-out which doesn't make a whole lot of since to me but hey whatever.  The chips and salsa is good it's nothing special.  The sweet tea was a bit under sweetened to my liking but the rest of my party seemed to think it was okay. What can I say I'm from Georgia and I love my sweet tea well you know sweet.  I would definitely give this spot a go.  They do reservations but each time I have been I didn't need one.  I guess it's all about the time and day you go.  Enjoy :)",

    "text": "This was the first dinner we had on a recent trip to Charlotte to visit friends. Cantina 1511 was recommended by my friend's coworker so none of us really knew what to expect. The food was much more high end compared to what I was expecting, so if you're looking for a good ol' messy cheese covered burrito, this probably isn't the place to go. They had a really good looking list of tacos, but I ended up trying the crab quesadilla. Per the recommendation of the waiter, I added shrimp. The server told us the chef was a great seafood cook...no disagreements here, I loved it! Very different, but if you like seafood, it's a solid meal.   Honestly, there were a lot more items on the menu that sounded amazing and I would've loved to try, but the prices were really steep. We chose to split a picture of the blue margarita and honestly, it was nothing special. When the servers (not our waiter) brought the food out, he spilled my boyfriend's drink all over him. The owner and our waiter apologized, comped his meal, and brought two fresh drinks over on the house. We compared the two side by side, and the new drinks definitely had a little/lot of extra love (and by love I mean tequila).  If you're going to drink here, skip the pitcher and go with the individual drinks.    I can't say enough good things about our waiter we had there. He also mentioned that during the summer he plays music out on the patio, so if you like live music, definitely come by in the summer to check it out. All in all: great place, awesome food and service, not the best drinks in the world.",

They come in threes! :)",

Almost all the way home, we received a call from them telling us they had forgotten to give us the fajita wraps. Being rush hour, we decided to just stop by the grocery store rather than drive all the way back. Instead, they insisted on driving to our house and bringing us the wraps!! Who does that?? That's incredible. Not only did we get our wraps but a free dessert as well. Top notch service.  Thank you guys at East Blvd. Cantina and thank you Ally who took care of this for us. We were beyond impressed.",

    "text": "Absolutely wonderful service. The manager was great too. Often a manager will see that waters need to be refilled and tell the server to do it. This manager asked if we needed refills, went and got a pitcher, and refilled our waters himself. That says a lot about the manager and the way the restaurant is run. I was very impressed. They really have a team effort going on here. I got the ancho shrimp salad which was SO GOOD. I would go back just for that salad. My husband got the enchiladas and was a bit disappointed that they weren't cheesier. He said they were just OK. My salad was a good, fair price at $10.75 but we thought the other menu items were a bit overpriced. $10 for guac or queso is steep. I also think $15 for 3 tacos is steep. I'm sure their rent costs a lot but my husband said the Mexican food down the road at the other Cantina is cheaper and better. I'd go back for the salad though!",

    "text": "I sent this email to the store manager and never got a response.   Good Morning,   I am writing to you our of great disappointment. Cantina 1511 has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte since it's opening. I have since moved out of town.l However last night I met and old friend at your Park Rd location and had some of the worst service I have experienced. Our server's name was Michelle, she had red hair. We arrived for our meal around 6:10 pm and were seated outside. Michelle stopped by the table and said she would be right with us - after five or so minutes she brought us our waters and we ordered some beers. It took 10 minutes for our beers to arrive and then she walked away to help another table before even offering to take our order. After an additional 10 minutes she did come back to take our orders. I got some vegetarian tacos (so not meat to cook) Queso, and my friend ordered the Crab and Goat Cheese Croquettes ( a simple fried appetizer). We proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our dinner while the three tables that were seated after us got their meals. When we inquired about our meal we were told and I quote: \"The croquettes have mashed potatoes in them so that takes a long time.\" Seriously - they are fried. So we finally get our food, and my vegetarian tacos come with the charro beans that have meat in them - so I didn't eat them and I didn't bother saying anything because we had already been there for over an hour. Then after we ate we waited about 20 minute for our waitress to stop avoiding us and bring us the tab. She would look right at us, and then go stop at another table, my friend finally went inside to find her and asked her to please bring our check. So in total we were at your establishment for almost 2 hours. I try not to complain, but I am just so disappointed. I understand that you establishment was busy, but this was unacceptable service.",

The restaurant was very busy as it was during lunch on a Friday, however there was no wait time and the food was ordered and on the table in no time!  Grilled fish taco's and chicken milanese tacos were simply to die for! Full of wonderful seasoning and flavors and slaw, and pico and the rice and the beans.......and ahhhh, I just loved every minute of it.  I'm still dreaming of Cantina..........",

    "text": "Horrible experience! My sister-in-law and I went for our birthday dinner. I called at 10:18 am the morning of the dinner to book a reservation (yes I know the exact time because I had to show the guy at the front (presumably the manager) my call log). The person I spoke with took my name, number and amount of people in my party. So imagine my surprise when I get there to discover there is no reservation. They advised they would get us seated in about thirty minutes. Annoying but a few people in our party were running behind so I didn't make to big of a deal about it. we grabbed drinks while waiting for a table. Well time continued on and all 16 of our party members corralled around the bar, at this point starving so eating chips and queso, whilst standing and seemingly aggravating the wait staff that walked by us. Finally after waiting over an hour, we are seated. Determined to have a good birthday I press forward. Unfortunately, there was only one server assisting and she seemed to already have multiple tables in addition to ours. She never took an actual table drink order, just brought out water, and if you could catch her walking by you could request an alcoholic beverage. Every time a question was asked of her, the tone always seemed annoyed that we even asked as opposed to wanting to be helpful. Our food took over an hour to come out and no one's food was hot. My boyfriends fajitas were so cold that he could put his hand directly on the cast iron skillet. He described it to me as \"refrigerator cold.\" Management offered to give us 3 free apps for the table. I had to flag the waitress down to order them. Unfortunately the first two appetizers I wanted they were out of, so kind of had to take what was available. All in all, I would describe the experience as chaotic, unorganized and completely disappointing.",

When I came to Cantina 1511, I have to say I found something that matched up pretty closely.   I have been here twice and both times the staff have been so helpful, they are always there to offer suggestions and every time they have been correct.   I have gotten the margarita sampler and that was really good. The blood orange one was delicious.   The guacamole is really fresh and tasty. I like my guacamole spicy and it wasn't really spicy but I am sure if you ask they will adjust it for you.   They give you a salsa that is mildly spicy but they have a spicy one so if you like spicy food ask for the spicy one. You will not be disappointed.   The food was delicious too, the first time I got cheese enchilada and I thought it was too cheesy (like way to cheesy) but the second time I got a veggie enchilada and it was much better.   Overall, a great place to have great mexican food in Charlotte.",

We had a large party, and since they didn't take reservations until after 830 we pushed back when we were planning on eating until 830 to ensure seats and good service with such a large group. This was not the case.  At least we had a table right away but the service was terrible.  It took almost 30 minutes after our drink orders were placed for our first drinks to arrive.  They were just passed down the table for us to pick which one we thought we ordered.   After being there for an hour we had to flag down the waitress to ask if we could order food, she said she was waiting for us to get settled. We'd been there for an hour. We were settled.  Food was good per usual (except they \"ran out\" of the one thing I wanted), and came out in a decently timely manner especially compared to the speed of the drinks. Waters weren't refilled unless asked, and never once were we checked on unless we flagged down the waitress.  I'm a pretty patient person and I understand we were a big party and things get busy. But the rest of the restaurant was pretty empty (especially after an hour into being there), there were tons of empty tables, and plenty of other employees standing around literally doing nothing, or giving back rubs to each other standing behind our table.  I felt like someone should have stepped in to help out since there were plenty of people around to do it.   Food, drinks, and company were good.  I think I'll stick to the Ballantyne location from now on!",

We ordered the table side guac because of how good we heard it was and they made it to your preference right there next to you. My girlfriend got fresh margaritas, and chicken enchiladas which had a spinach and cheese filling and a queso sauce on top. I ordered 3 tacos, carne asada in chunks, duck breaded with cilantro, and shrimp and scallop with a spicy sauce. All equipped with taco kickstands when you need a break. They're size is deceiving, they're super filling. All the toppings were fresh, taste buds were tingly.   Portions were big enough to fill you up and bring home leftovers. Overall an excellent dining experience. Will be going back for sure.",

    "text": "I've tried very hard to give this place a chance, but after THREE visits, I just can't anymore.  The last time I went was last Friday, 11/11/2016, the Friday after election day.  The first drink I had was the Cadillac, their signature margarita.  It was so sweet, it took me a very long time to get through it.  For 16$, I expect my drink to be top notch delicious and to the standard expected.  Nothing close.  The second drink I ordered was a regular margarita, with patron tequila.  A diffferent drink  HAS to be better.  Absolutely WORSE!  It was SO SICKLY sweet, I could only get through 1/4 of the drink, and I LOVE my drinks.  I even let my boyfriend try a sip, and he is a non-drinker and a bad choice to be a critic because he doesn't like alcohol that much.  He LOVED the fact that it was SO sweet, which is a TERRIBLE indicator.  Nevertheless, we left there with 3/4 of my expensive patron margarita.  I ordered the street pizza which was on the app menu for 10$.  It was just OK.  I ate 2 slices and left the rest.  My bf ordered the beef and chicken fajitas.  I tried the beef and it was very chewy, not tender in any way.  I had the shrimp fajitas the time before when we were there and they were decent, but nothing to write home about or give a great review for.  The sides that the fajitas come with are ok, You get a group of sliced carrots with cheese, lettuce and some guac.  No rice or beans unless you order those separately,, but you still pay a premium price for the plate.  Its sad because I wanted to really like this place, but just can't.  I would choose any mexican spot in Charlotte over Cantina 1511.  The food quality for such an expensive price, along with the drinks as well (well, if you know the bartender working that night, or know who he/she is/was, then they were HORRIBLE!!!!! and need to know that!!!) in such a cool hot spot is totally NOT worth any of it.  I don't even think my rating should be poor at 2 stars, it really should be TERRIBLE, 1 star.  Cantina 1511, you need to revamp everything if you want to continue to do decent business.  I'm so sorry and disappointed that it is this bad.  :(",

The inside looks nice, the service at the bar was good, but was so disappointed in everything else.  They downsized the tortilla chip bowls. The red salsa, which we loved, was mega salty. When my husband, who loves salt, says something is salty, it's salty. We can no longer order a pint of beer. It's either 12 or 20 oz. Yet the price for the 12oz is the same as the old pint.  The table side guac, one of our faves, was salty. My vegan burrito was salty and I found traces of goat cheese in it. My husbands enchilada was salty.    Seriously, put down the salt shaker!    We are hoping this was just a fluke because for all the years we were going to the East Blvd location we never had a bad anything.    We'll be back and hoping for a better food experience.",

    "text": "So if you're into a little more upscale Mexican food this place is a good choice. There's two location, and I've been to both. The Dilworth location in Charlotte is by far better. The food presentation has more thought behind it, and the ambiance is all together nicer. You feel less rushed at this location and it's the original one. So if choosing between the two places ... go to this one first.   As for my meal at Cantina 1511, I ordered the Salmon al Pastor. This is a nice sized piece of pan seared salmon with an achiote and lime flavoring. It is garnished with roasted pineapple, and is placed over black beans on top of a fried tostada with pico de gallo salsa thrown into the mix. Also, on the very top of the dish there are two giant green grilled scallion bulbs garnishing the masterpiece. The dish goes for $16 and is excellent.   Warm chips and salsa come with the meal, and if you're lucky you'll get an amazing waiter just like we had. The server was so attentive ... it was almost comical how speedy fast he was. I loved it because it added to the whole experience.   All in all, I have nothing but good things to say about this location and meal.   NOW BEWARE: Parking is a bit tough on a busy night so keep this in mind. I parked in the lot next store. AND, if you're on a budget and are looking for a \"super inexpensive\" Mexican meal this may not be your place. Cantina is more upscale and the prices are not dirt cheap so remember that before choosing this location for anyone on a budget. Other than that - I hope you enjoy!  BTW: if you're wondering why only \"4\" stars out of \"5\" it because the meal was really good but not \"knock my socks off amazing\" for the price. It's totally a place worth going but I keep my \"5 star\" ratings for only places that I craze days, weeks and months after dining there.",

Likes:  It's a fun atmosphere, buzzing with energy.  The margaritas and guac are good if you're willing to pay up for them.  Dislikes:  So expensive, even when they're running \"specials\" like about $18 for a pitcher of margaritas.  I had pork tacos one time: the food is sub-par and the quality is not great.  After that, I just got drinks there.  It's always packed, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.  Take it or leave it:  Leave it.  It's trendy but majorly over-hyped and over-priced.  I would expect better quality from a \"fancy\" Mexican place.",

Had to wave bartender down to place an order, service was the worst I have experienced in years, there were a total of 7 people at the whole bar which made it so surprising .  All food was cold, and they had back waiters bring it out, could never get refills on beer, actually got worse at the end. Got desert to go since it took so long, tres lechees was terrible. I have been a regular at this groups restaurants for years as they have grown, first time I felt like I was at a chain restaurant. Hope we just had bad luck but I won't go back to that location again.",

    "text": "My wife and I were craving mexican and happen to be in the dilworth area.  We decided to stop and give them a try.  Just for some background information, we love mexican.  Biombo's in concord is our favorite and for in charlotte we enjoy loco lime.    I will say that this is not a bad place.  I gave them 3 stars because this is not the mexican food that we enjoy.  First we ordered the Queso with our chips.  This is not the regular white queso that many mexican restaurants want.  This is more of an authentic queso, it has onions and is slightly brown compared to white that we are use to.  So my wife nor daughter really liked that.    We all got burritos and thought they were ok.  The carne assata did not have the best flavor and just was not the best one I had.    I do not think this place is bad and could see how people would love it.  I think it is just not my cup of tea.  On a better note the table service Guacamole looked great.  If i ever find myself back I will give it a try.   For regular visits I will stick with Loco Lime and our number one favorite Biombo's",

    "text": "If it's a spring or fall evening and you want to enjoy some above average mexican cuisine, grab a table on the front porch of Cantina 1511.  We went during the week and simply had a plate of nachos and a few beers.  I was starving when we went and had planned to get entrees but thoughts we'd just have a good quality starter.  The nachos feature fresh ingredients and are a large portion.  By the time we ate 80% of the nachos and downed a couple Pacificos, we were stuffed!  It made for a cost effective.  I hadn't been a huge fan of 1511 in the past but that was probably 5 years ago.  I enjoyed this dish and will update my review after my next outing.  So far, I'm going 4 stars... excited to see what else they have to offer.",

Well I've talked about this place so much that I wanted to take my Mon for Mother's day. We had to wait 10 min to be seated even though we had reservations. Once seated our waiter came flying by with one glass of water to tell us he'll be back with another. Another 10min I got a glass of water. 15min later I stopped someone to bring us chips and salsa. Now that came quick. Then the waiter took our order. Mom ordere basic breakfast, I got the avocado egg bake. Our meal took 45min and it was cold. My mom's plate had a spoonful of hashbrowns. I asked the manager if this was normal portion size she said no maybe they thought it was a child's plate. She said she would bring more but the hashbrowns take 30 min to make...This was just a terrible mothers day. It will be a very very very long time before I even think about going back!!!",

Luckily, I had one in our seat by the booth to pass around to all the people so we could order from it.  My friend had to ask for water over 4 times.  We ordered an appetizer and immediately after it came our entree's came as well.  All she could say was \"oops your entrees came fast!  hehehehe.\"  She charged me for 3 drinks instead of two and took 10 minutes to bring our checks after we said we were in a hurry.  This really ruined it for me.  Bring back Frank to whip them into shape!",

The texture was perfectly crispy, but the fillings (steak, veggies, rice) were realllly salty. Also, my bf ordered a drink, a double shot of tequila and for 9 bucks per shot, that was a $20 drink!
