I wish they had more topping options and told you how much to add them on the signage. Fries were good but cheese fries were nasty, regular fries tasted like they have no salt on them but have a good texture. chocolate shake is kinda weird and has a powdered chocolate (think Ovaltine) texture. so I'd give it 3/5!",

I've had \"Inn&Out\" and \"Shake'n'steak\" and \"Freddy's\" and I can say this is definitely as good if not better than the three. We went a few weeks after opening on a Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door but just to the curb. It was a quick line. I ordered a single cheeseburger with a strawberry shake and cheesefries. All of it was delicious. The ch see fried have a liquidy sauce on them but not the strange jello kind you get on nachos at the ball game, much better, liquid gold. Shake was thick and creamy. Burger tasted great, soft bun and yummy sauce. It was very busy but we were able to find seats inside",

I do not know what changed since our last visit which was to the Woodlawn store but WOW!  This was an amazing experience.  I ordered the Double Shack with loaded fries and my partner had the Shack-cago Dog and the Chicken sandwich.  We split the dog and it was very good.  My burger.  O.M.G.  Nothing compared to the last one. This baby was juicy, flavorful and worth the whole $7.99.  I was blown away.  The fries were a hit as well.  Yummy cheese sauce topped with bits of cooked-just-right bacon!  I had to have a bite of the chicken as well.  This did not disappoint.  The breading was crispy and the whole muscle chicken breast seasoned perfectly.  Lots of mayo, just how we like it.  We finished it with a Concrete which was equally as good.  This location is about 1.5 miles from my house so we will definitely return. On my next visit, I promised myself I would order the Spicy chicken sandwich.  Might have a burger too because they are so damned good!  Well done, Shake-Shack!",

But the one in charlotte they will need to get it together before I go again.  The line was out the door the design of the place is backwards.  In NYC the line is inside.  We orderedI saw a table empty had my friend sit so I waited fir our food.  I was getting drinks an a lady in front if me said they are out of ice an she asked the young lady behind the counter, the employee said she get ice in the cup she handled just odd.  Mind you nobody was filling up the machine with ice an there had to be 10 of us tryin to get ice.  Than there mustard an ketchup      Station both mustard pumps were out.  I told an employee an the young lady said both ketchup are full.  Bless i want mustard she finally changed the bags thank goodness. So after most have there food than what looked like the manager came out wiped a table or 2 an put ice in the ice machine SMH if they want to stay busy I suggest they figure out how to keep things filled an the line down.  I think if times square can keep the food coming out quickly than charlotte can surely fix the problem. I cant say ill go back until its  more organized but a good burger much better than theres is HOBOs in fort mill  .",

When I walked up to the counter, the staff is in the kitchen chuckling and having a good time. No one acknowledges a waiting customer. Then a girl finally strolls over to the register to take my order after I made eye contact. In the same breath that she's taking my order she pulls her phone out and starts TEXTING!!! I simply ordered one chicken sandwich with no mayo. It confused the hell out of her. She asked, no tomatoes? The sandwich doesn't even come with tomatoes! After I repeated myself five times she finally got it right. Then I asked for honey mustard and she was like it's around the corner. It wasn't. Only regular mustard was around the corner. TBH, I'll probably go back but if she's at the register I will kindly turn around to go across the street to Chick-Fil-A.",

The restaurant was very chill calm, organized and not hectic even with a large customer audience. Burgers were just as flavorful and juicy as their other Shake Shack's I've been to in Manhattan.

I wasn't shocked, because any time I have Shake Shack in other cites. It's in one of the trendy sides of town.  So I'm pleased already to say the least. Once we get in I thought the line was going to be long because it's a new spot and if Charlotte doesn't do anything else. It's a city that loves to eat. I ordered a tasty bacon cheese burger with cheese fries but the cheese on the side. Biting in to the burger was amazing. I was shocked. It was juicy and flavorful. I should have added lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Live and learn. The fries were hot and the cheese sauce was good. Give it a try yourself to see what the rave is about.",

Many people are familiar with Shake Shack and if you're not, then you should know it's the East coast version of In-and-Out and If you don't know what In-and-Out is, then you need to get out more.  The shortcomings. This location is shiny, new, and apparently pretty hard to keep clean. After being open for a couple of months, I expected things to have settled down and working like a well-oiled machine. Even when it's not too crowded, you will wait a fair amount of time for your order.   If you've been to one Shake Shack, you've (pretty much) been to them all. If you only get one thing off the menu, make it the blueberry concrete that mixes their custard with locally sourced blueberry pie from Suarez bakery. It is worth every single damn calorie.   Prices are Shake Shack prices, so don't expect a super great deal. Burgers are fairly small and honestly the fries taste like fried, frozen French fries, but that shouldn't stop you from demolishing a tray of them.  It's good, no doubt about it. When you want a step up from fast food burger and fries, it will certainly hit the spot, just don't expect the experience to be a step up. Solid 4/5.",

The people of Charlotte were so excited to get one and I was excited for them lol. I went a few weeks after they opened. There was plenty of parking and a nice amount of seating on the inside and outside. I ordered the shack burger a side of fries and drink. This place is not like your average fast food place. Come prepared to spend at least $15 on your meal. It's pretty good quality so that makes it worth the price but it's not something I eat every week. It's more like a treat lol. Definitely have to try the dessert. They are always changing up flavors.",

So today i drove by to see if they still had lines out the door and they didn't so I decided to go in for lunch and try it out.  It's average. It's good. I would never stand in line for this place ever.  It's very expensive for what you get.  Bacon cheese burger small fry and small drink was $14 and the burger was very small. It was good but very small. For this price I will go over to Duckworths and get a much larger burger and tastier in my opinion.",

I will, however, repeat the complaining about the seating - or lack thereof.   This place has been packed since opening day. Standing in a long crazy line in whatever weather Mother Nature decides to bestow on us. Whether it's pouring rain or sweltering heat, You wait in long lines outside the door just to order food. Once your order is in, it's another battle finding seating. Obviously if the lines are long, tables will be packed as well. If you're in a large group, good luck finding a seat for your entire party. But let's say you find a seat - whatever you do, you can NOT leave that seat without someone holding the table. People stand around with trays of food, searching for a table and once it's open, there are several folks waiting to grab your spot. I saw a lady with an infant who got up to grab a booster seat, and when she returned, another couple took her spot. The confrontation that followed... awkward...   Limited seating is the only reason for losing a star.",

It's not that it's not good, because it is, but for the hype I was expecting mouth changing orgasmic food. I can get similar foods from various places. If I want crinkle cut fries, American Deli does that. For a good flatop burger you can go to Mr. K's, Zacks, or even.....Smash Burger. Even the concrete is essentially run of the mill soft serve ice cream and cookie butter you can get from Trader Joes. They are able to overprice the food because of the name and following.   Again, I'm not saying this place isn't good for what it does and it may sound like I'm ragging on it, but I just want to be one of the few that gives a different realistic opinion from the masses of \"It's Amazing\".",

The food is delicious for sure - juicy burgers; soft, buttery buns; unique sauces; and big flavor combinations. However, the high-quality taste isn't enough to offset the $15 price tag and small portion size for me, especially since the fries and the shake I also purchased were pretty average - typical fries, a typical shake. I do plan to return, but not often, and if I do, I might opt out of fries and definitely will opt out of a shake. The burgers are what shine at Shake Shack.",

Let's go down the list and talk about how each was!  Smoke Shack: this was my burger and hmmm I didn't love it with my first bite. It was drenched in sauce and for some reason was extremely sour. I think it was sour because of the red pepper maybe?  Beef patty itself was salty.   Shake Shack: 10/10 would recommend! Your typical cheeseburger with a flair.   Fries: Never really liked crinkle fries til' I tasted theirs.   Pie oh Boy (Blueberry Pie): Rich and creamy and very pie-like.

I always loved going up north or down to Florida and making it my priority to get shake shack, and these location is just as great! First the burgers are amazing. My fav is the shake stack...an already delicious cheeseburger but with a fried stuffed mushroom on top! It is EVERYTHING! Get extra shakesauce, you won't regret it! A close second is the smoke shack, that chopped cherry pepper is the secret weapon!  I must say, I usually focus on the burgers and the perfect bacon cheese fries. I can't wait to venture off the menu and try the chicken, hot dogs and very tempting shakes!  Please not, it's still new and long lines are usual.

I've heard really good things about the mushroom burger and may try it next time. The chicken sandwich surprised me, very tasty and nice and crispy. The crinkle fries won me over in a heartbeat. And the concrete, oh the concrete. SO DELICIOUS! I could eat that all day. They had two flavors to choose from (a cookie dough toffee or chocolate one). The toffee cookie butter was delicious.

Shake Shack won't replace Bang Bang, Bad Daddy's or another gourmet burger place, but it's not as expensive either. I also like Five Guys, about the same price point as Shake Shack, but Shake Shack is a little better in my view with a little broader menu. If you want better than McDonalds (about $15 for 2 adults) without spending Bang Bang/Bad Daddy prices ($45 for 2), you'll like Shake Shack ($30 for 2) and it's a little better than Five Guys. Shake Shack has a limited menu, but they have limited beer and wine choices.",

    "text": "Such a let down, especially after waiting in a huge line. My husband and I were major Shake Shack fans when we lived in NY. I wish I could say it was just as good as it used to be but to be completely honest, the food was terrible. I got the shackburger with no cheese. What I was given was a sad, unseasoned piece of meat with a wilted piece of lettuce and two bland tomatoes. For some reason they left off the onions and pickles? I don't even think they seasoned or salted the meat. It just tasted like burnt, grizzled meat. I'm not one to be dramatic about food but it was so bad that I ate about 3 bites and threw it away. The fries were good, but its pretty hard to screw up crinkle fries. I realize i'm in the minority with all these positive reviews but I wonder how much that has to do with the novelty of it.  Hopefully they step up their game.",

I was happily surprised that we did not have to wait in a long line but our order did take longer to make than the competitors. The atmosphere is clean, open, modern and there is plenty of outdoor seating available. The burgers were good (noticeably salty) but ordinary. The fries were crinkled fries which I like, but again they were also ordinary. I thought for sure the pazzaz would be found in the shakes, but again they were ordinary. So for $60 for a family of four, I didn't feel the need to come back, but I did enjoy trying something new. I liked the presentation of the burgers in a throw back paper around the burger, as well as the cute bag they put the food in. But overall the food itself was ordinary.",

It only took a few minutes to order our food and we waited around 10 minutes to receive it once ordered. We both ordered the shake shack burger with our own custom toppings and included the shake shack sauce. With fries and large drinks, we spent around $30.00 for two people. Eh, on the price. I was impressed both with the presentation of the burger and taste! The shake sauce is definitely a must try, at least on the side if you're skeptical. The fries were crispy and hot and the burgers ingredients tasted fresh. Do I think what I received is worth $30.00, I would air on the side of not really; however it's an experience you have to try at least once. If I ordered shakes with my meals I would say yes! I made the mistake of not trying their shakes my first time around, I won't make that mistake my next go round but I have no doubt this isn't the last shake shack has seen of me!",

I didn't go right away when it opened, but finally after a few months I was able to go. After waiting 40 minutes in line on a Wednesday at 2:00pm, I was able to order. The prices definitely surprised me for what I thought was a fast food style burger spot. I got a double burger, fries and chocolate shake and ran me $18! The quality does NOT live up to that price. It's very similar quality to 5 guys and the shake was nothing special. It costs extra just to get whipped cream. So all in all very disappointed. If you want an overpriced burger that really is nothing special, and want to wait quite a while to get it, then this is your spot. For me I'll just go to one of the other much better burger spots at that price around Charlotte.",

Once we placed our order we only waited about 10 minutes or less for our food to come out.   My only negative comment is that the fries leave much to be desired. I don't even think they used a hint of salt on them. BUT, my strawberry shake was amazing and once we got inside the line moved fairly quickly. They have a large outdoor patio and plenty of seating on the inside!",

I learned pretty quickly that there is no need to get fancy here, order the ShakeShack Burger (add pickles) with a side of fries. This original combo is definitely a winner.   The menu has a lot of options, and it's set up on the wall when you first walk in. You order at the front counter and then sit--they'll buzz you when it's ready. The Shake Shack sauce is great, love it on the crinkle fries.  I agree, it's a little pricey for a burger and fries - but it comes down to quality, and you know you're getting a good meal here.",

They  shake shack sauce is tasty look like thousand island dressing but doesn't taste like that at all.  I went on a Monday and lines were that bad. The cheese for the cheese fries wasn't the greatest and clumped up kind of quickly. They have different burgers and they also offer hot dogs and chicken sandwiches.  The restaurant is very casual and they have a patio that is dog friendly. Their milkshakes and ice cream are also very popular.",

I've had Shake Shack at the original location in Manhattan and it was great there, and then had them in upper east side and in Boston, and they're still good but tough to pay for at this price for burgers and fries once you've had it a few times. Great to take people who haven't tried Shake Shack yet, so they can add to the neverending debate of best burgers around the country. I think I'm an In-n-Out guy, so take that for a grain of salt.",

The reason I'm giving a lower rating was due to service.  We were given a buzzer to let us know when the food was ready to pick up at the counter. It never went off. We weren't worried because it was so busy.  Then someone in the restaurant was walking around to find us and we finally spotted him carrying what looked like our order. It had set on the counter and then carried around on hot the patio.  The kids were disappointed that their milkshakes were runny.  Our fries were cold and burgers lukewarm.   Probably better to carry out and wait.",

The location is strong but parking in the park road parking lot is always crazy. The space is big and seemed clean. The employees were friendly! The line wasn't super long and we waited about 10 minutes for our food.   I got the bacon single burger with pickles. The burger was juicy and the pickle slices were pretty thick. We also got bacon cheese fries. I'm not the biggest fan of the cheese but the bacon bits were delicious!   They don't have combos so be prepared to order everything separate. Overall the quality is solid but still the hype was too much I think. It's good to go if you are in the mood but it's not out of this world. I have had the milkshakes in NYC and they are pretty darn good, didn't try it here though. Definitely a place to try out but it's not a go to for me.",

With that said, it was good so we were looking forward to it coming to CLT. We went a few months after it opened, hoping to have avoided the crowds. We were wrong. It was super crowded and busy. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my husband ordered a burger. We both enjoyed our sandwiches. We shared the fries (which, honestly, I thought weren't too great).  My main issue here is how crazy it was. For as packed as it gets, I wish they arranged tables in a communal way where there weren't so many half tables being used while other people stood around searching for a seat. Additionally, the place was a mess, which is more of a reflection of the people dining there than the staff (come on people, we can clean up after ourselves). It also took about 15-20 minutes for our order to be complete, which seemed a little long.   In general, this spot is just okay to me.",

Jake shared \"We have high standards for how we source our ingredients, choosing a proprietary blend of freshly ground, 100% all-natural Angus beef, which is served on a non-GMO Martin's Potato Roll and contains no hormones and no antibiotics. Our crinkle cut fries are made from Yukon potatoes that are free from the artificial ingredients that so many fries include. Likewise, our 16oz shakes are made with frozen custard that is spun daily at our Shacks. Our vanilla and chocolate recipes use only real sugar, no corn syrup, and milk from dairy farmers who pledge not to use artificial growth hormones.\"  Jake also provided me a card so I came back for a second visit. The gluten free bun and burger were good, and the crinkle fries were crisp and hot. The lemonade was also delicious.   It took a little more than 10 minutes from entering the line to getting my food.",

Honestly the only reason we decided to come was because it was the only place open at 11 am on a Sunday in the area.  Popped my friends Shake Shack cherry!  Right now their featured shake is cookies and cream. But there's more! You have it either chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.  I had to go with the strawberry cookies and cream shake just because I was told it tasted like strawberry cheesecake.  It did not disappoint! It was even topped with vanilla Oreo crumbles. My only compliant about the shakes there is that I would like to be able to order it when I order my meal and then come back to the counter after I eat my meal and pick it up (like they do at Freddys) by the time I finished my meal and moved onto the shake, it was already melted and warm.  On to the food! I had the shack burger with fries and added onion. Friend had the smoked shack burger.  He really enjoyed his but we both agreed it wasn't worth the cost.  The patty was thin and over cooked. Nothing juicy about it.  I'm not a fan of their fries either. Thick Crinkle cut fries just don't hit the spot.  I'm sure I'll be back sometime and have just a burger. Oh, and maybe try a new featured shake!",

You will get some of your steps in with the parking situation. I came on a Saturday early evening and it was packed. The line was out the door. I am all too familiar with the brand and quite enjoy their shakes. I got the regular burger with the shack sauce, fries, and a cookies and cream shake. The cookies and cream shake wasn't advertised on the regular or limited edition menu, but it's available.  The shake was great! I'll come back for more flavors. The burger was good but nothing special and the fries compliment the burger. The staff were working so hard to get the food out and turn over the tables, etc. it's busy now because it's new and the only one in the city. I am sure the excitement will die down and long lines will not be forever. It's a good place to get a burger and there are stores you can walk up nearby so location is prime. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Shake Shack offers a delicious variety of nutritious foods. Additionally, Shake Shack offers a feeling of warmth and joys from a simpler time. The luscious buns compliment to crisp, fresh lettuce and the scrumptious, melted cheese. The toppings pair delightfully with the perfectly cooked burger patty. All together the burger touches tastebuds and tanins that haven't been touched in years. However, the burgers--while still being the work of art that they are--are extremely overpriced, and the service is mediocre. I will come again, but, personally, would have a much more enjoyable experience if the was a bit faster. That's all. End of review.",

There was still a good sized line and we had to wait outside for a few minutes before getting a chance to look at the menu. I love the atmosphere of the building -- very modern and sleek. The service was wasn't terrible, but the cashier was not friendly at all and you could tell she more than didn't want to be there. There was one employee at the drink/condiment area keeping it really clean, which I overly appreciated because that area seems to always be the first one overlooked at a fast food joint. My boyfriend and I each ordered burgers, and a shake with a French fry to share. Totally like $26...seems a little over priced for what it is. The burger was good but it really wasn't very big. You could get better burgers at any neighborhood grill. I was also disappointed in the size of the milkshake for like $5 a shake. Was it good? Yes. Was it worth it? Not really.",

Cons: the staff was pretty brutal. Despite being open for several weeks, the staff was disorganized, overwhelmed and seemed to be cutting corners and throwing food and drinks together sloppily.  My fiancee and I ordered two single shake burgers, two cheese fries and two shakes. The patties were average at best. The bun was soggy, there was barely any cheese on the burger, the cheese fries had little to no cheese and the shakes were nothing special.   We spent $31 which is typical for their menu, and sadly, I wish the food lived up to the billing. We noticed tons of people complaining about their food and often couples next to us not finishing their burgers, fries or shakes. This is very abnormal from my prior experiences in NYC.  Despite the long lines, which aren't really long compared to other large cities, the service and food does not justify us coming back.",

    "text": "Would you like some flies to go with that shake?  My last visit to Shake Shack was probably my last, at least until after fly season is over. There were flies everywhere.  The problem is that their doors stay open all the time because their ordering area is too small to accommodate a significant amount of people, so the line out the door holds the doors open for the flies.  The flies don't even have to wait in the line like everyone else; they just fly in and start eating. SS really needs to do something to address this unsanitary condition.   As for the food,  the burger was pretty good, but too small for the price. The chocolate shake was good, but pathetically small.  I can't believe that they only offer the shakes in what is essentially a kid's size when the place is called \"Shake Shack\". \"Tiny Shake Shack\" would be a better name. You can get a much better meal deal across the parking lot at the Soda Shop - better food, better quantity, better price, and a delicious, grown-up-sized shake.",

If you want to avoid lines, stay away after 5 on weekdays and all day on weekends until the novelty wears off. They also have an app where you can pre-order and cut the line.  Bottom line, enjoy the good burgers.",

Parking is crowded. But that's typical.  There was a quick moving line when we came in Friday night.  Their prices are high for what it is. We split a single burger, double burger and fries for about $18.    We had no problem finding a seat. The burger was super tasty. I understand the hype. It had a nice char/crust. Mine came without lettuce so I asked for some and they brought me a whole new burger and to keep the original. It was really no big deal. I was just looking for the green lettuce for some crunch.  I liked the vibe, the food, and the experience. We'll definately throw it in the rotation.",

I went with my sister and her friend for a casual dinner & was surprised at my thoughts. First of all we had to wait in an EPIC line to even get in the restaurant - this is totally to be expected though as the restaurant was new. Once inside we ordered 3 sandwiches, 2 orders of fries and 3 milkshakes. I was taken aback when my total was a whopping $60 - all for burgers and fries. The food was good don't get me wrong but it wasn't everything I was hyping it up to be. Plus, paying NYC prices in the middle of suburban Charlotte wasn't ideal. It was good but I won't be rushing back",

The only thing I was surprised with was that the place only had 4 high chairs given number of people in there with small children. We have 18 month old twins and it was a bit of a struggle to find high chairs at first.  Also, it would have been nice to know that hot dogs would come charred (which I ordered for kids), given the lack of a kids menu (unless there was one I missed). Next time I would request for them not to char the kids dogs. If it was for me, the char would have been great, but that's not a favorite preparation for the kids.   All and all a good experience and we'll be back!",

The food was ready pretty quickly, and you're given a little buzzer to know when it's ready, so that you can go ahead and sit down while you wait.  My only real complaint is the way they designed the area by the drink machine, it's too small of an area for the amount of people that are getting drinks and/or passing through. The prices are a little high, but the food is worth it. Definitely tastes of higher quality than a cheaper burger restaurant. I got a Mocha Cookies & Cream milkshake today, and it was amazing. I ordered it without knowing the price, and was a little shocked when I saw it was almost $6, but it was definitely worth it. The best milkshake I've had!",

The workers look like they are having a good time, but it errs on the side of unprofessional in some situations. Other than that, I love the food, the cleanliness, and accuracy with my order. I live around 45 minutes away from there but whenever I am close, I hop on the app and put in a order. It is my guilty pleasure. The shack stack is something special, truly unique and delicious.

I'm no connoisseur but I did find that hard to believe based on looking at the menu ahead of time. I will say this was the first fast food place that I noticed was a la carte and quite overpriced if you ask me, but I was still very excited to try because I wanted to know what all the ra ra was about. I will say it is in prime location and the environment is very casual and comfy. I always love that aspect when it comes to places..makes me feel right at home.  I ordered the shroom burger, crinkle fries, and a pie oh my concrete. I was excited because the pie concrete is based on seasonal flavors and also the proceeds go to a foundation of good cause. The seasonal flavor was blueberry pie and it was the best thing on my plate. The shroom burger was okay, definitely not disguised as a burger because the mushroom taste is very strong. The cheese within the burger is a bit much it caught me by surprise when I took a bite and scorching hot cheese was spot back at me. The only condiments they have for fries is cheese, yellow mustard, ketchup and I feel like within today's times people eat fries with so much more but could just be me. I spent 18 dollars on one meal which seemed like a bit much to me for a \"fast food\" meal especially when all I really enjoyed was the concrete. More power to the people that love this place but I will pass",

While on a weekend trip in Charlotte I was so excited to finally try shake shack! I had been dreaming of this moment after seeing the deliciousness on IG. The first thing I noticed is that the prices were higher than I expected, but I know when the ingredients are a high quality things tend to go up. I ordered a burger, fries, and a drink.  The purchased a double shack burger with bacon and all the fixings. The burger was juicy, although saltier than what I like, the bun was perfect and the onions, lettuce, pickles, etc. seemed very fresh. The crinkle fries were amazing and came with a good amount.   I like shake shack and maybe I need to try the ice cream, but the burger was no where near the same amount of meat you get at a Five Guys and although the fries were great, you get a full greasy bag at Five Guys.  Overall, I would return to try something different but I will not be getting a ticket for a seat on the Shake Shack hype-mobile.",

I feel like this particular location can be a bit on the slow side in terms of actually getting the food to the people. They work on a buzzer system, and there's usually only one person getting the food from the \"ready\" shelf to the people who have been buzzed that their food is ready. This can get a little backed up especially when there are multiple mobile orders ready to go.   Also be forewarned that this location is at Park Road Shopping Center which can be notorious for parking difficulties.   The food itself has always been delicious, and I want to come back to try some of their other menu items but I've always been a burger and cheese fries girl if I'm splurging my calorie intake for the week here.",

The cashier was kind and patient as I asked questions and ordered my food.   I ended up going with the ShackBurger and fries with a chocolate milkshake.   The burger was delicious! It was cooked up hot and fresh and had great flavors. I'd absolutely recommend this! The french fries are crinkle cut and delicious. I enjoyed them plain today but they also offer cheese and bacon which I might try next time!   The milk shake was so thick and yummy. I added whip cream...because what's a milkshake without it? And it added a nice touch. I'd recommend grabbing a spoon to enjoy it.   I also tried the hotdog with all the fixings. I really enjoyed it.   Everything was delicious! I can't wait to come back. I also can't wait to try using the app and grabbing a mobile order so I don't have to wait in line.",

Our burgers were amazing and the Shake was so creamy and smooth. I will definitely come back here when it calms down a bit, but hopefully they will open more shake shacks in our area. One con: why don't they have peanut butter milkshakes year round??? That's the most popular milkshake!!",

    "text": "3 visits - 3 incorrect orders  1st time through, I asked for the fries to be 'light salt' and extra crispy (if possible) and was told by the cashier that would be no problem. When I received my order, I tasted a fry at the counter and it was super-salty. I asked the expediter to correct that, and he grabbed another basket of pre-prepared fries from the top of the line and handed it to me. I asked him to please get me fresh fries with lighter salt, and to possibly overcook the fries if possible, and was told that they \"have to sell these fries\". So I left disappointed, and decided not to order fries here again.  - The burgers were delicious, the fries; not so much.  2nd visit, ordered 3 burgers to go. Got home, and 2 of them were incorrect. There was a beef patty missing from one burger that was supposed to be a double, and the other burger was missing bacon. As the location is 20+ mins from my home, it wasn't worth correcting, and we just ate what we had, after sharing bacon out of another burger.  - The burgers were, as  above, delicious, but not what we ordered - or paid for.  3rd visit, yesterday evening. Last visit. As I was checking my order at the counter (prior experience told me this is mandatory), surprise! Once again, a double burger ordered was a single burger delivered. At that time another gentleman was complaining to the expediter that his chicken sandwich was undercooked, and showing that it was pink-ish in the middle. The expediter engaged him in argument stating that that's how it is cooked. When the gentleman asked for a new sandwich to be more thoroughly cooked, he was told that they would \"cook 'em the same way\", and the expediter was clearly resistant to correct the issue or empathize with the client. I wasn't about to head down that same road, so I took my overly expensive single burger, and left.  - Again, burgers were great, just not what I ordered or paid for.  Won't be back, they have at least $7 of my money for extra patties and bacon that they never made good on. They can keep it, I'll call it an inexpensive lesson.",

I'm a die hard Chik-Fil-a fan and I feel guilty saying it but, the chicken sandwiches here are the best I've ever had.  I'm obsessed!!  We were going almost once a week for a while and the food is consistently on point.  My husband usually gets some kind of burger, I get the Chicken Shack with cheese fries.  I love the herby mayo and the plethora of pickles on the sandwich.  I looooove the cheese sauce on the fries - like I'm lactose intolerant, but it's worth it.  Even the hotdogs are legit.  Just go there.  Get one of everything and then die happy.  *Just a helpful warning: the place stays busy.  So it's on the slower side of fast food.  But be patient because it's worth it.",

    "text": "We're fans and have been anticipating the arrival of Shake Shack to the Charlotte area.   When we arrived the line was all the way out the door and past the building. It took us 15 minutes to get to the cashier to order and then we waited about 15 minutes to get our food after we ordered. So a 30 minute wait all together wasn't that bad for me.  I went with the Chickn'Shack which was amazing. My only gripe was that I wanted more. To start I am a fan of potato rolls and bread. This bread is the perfect accompaniment for these sandwiches. The crispy battered chicken with the herbed mayo was perfect.   Since they don't have a kids menu my son went with the Single ShackBurger with ketchup only and he demolished it.    My hunny ordered the SmokeShack and it was good too. He let me take a bite. And then another when I asked for some more! LOL! The cherry pepper on the burger is not overpowering and balances out the smoky and saltiness from the bacon.   We ordered two fries - one plain, one bacon cheese fries. The fries themselves were good but not sure we order the bacon cheese fries again. At almost $5 they were skimpy on the cheese and bacon.   I really love custard but the custard here did not do it for me. It was just okay over all.   The lemonade was overly sweet. And that may just be our taste buds and preference. We had to water it down significantly in order to be able to drink it.   We'll be back. The burgers are made right and so are the chicken sandwiches.",

We ordered a shake burger, BBQ bacon double burger, a chicken sandwich, a large concrete, a small ice cream(?), 1 drink, cheese fries, and BBQ bacon cheese fries. The total came out to about $46.  I've never been an extreme fan of five guys and living on the east coast my whole life I've never had a Whataburger or in and out so, that being said, shake shack currently sits atop the throne of chain-not-fast-food-but-not-restaurant burger spots. They don't do one specific thing very well but they do it better than the others(that I've had).  This location was very busy when we visited and that's due to the hype, which it seems a few people were affected by.. I'd suggest if you're visiting for the first time to tame your expectations.. it's not the second coming of Christ.. it's just a decent hamburger.",

    "text": "What even. This place blew me away and I don't even like hamburgers. But I love veggie burgers and Shake Shack managed to make a sinfully good (most definitely unhealthy) vegetarian option, which most fast food establishments desperately fail at - the Shroom burger.   Upon ordering, the lady at the cashier asked me if I'd had it before, basically warning me that it was just a giant fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese (no burger patty). As if that wasn't enough?? I also got one of the concretes, which is essentially frozen custard with mix ins. I decided on the Shack Attack, which is chocolate custard, fudge, cookie dough, chocolate chunks, and chocolate sprinkles. I love chocolate so this was good but a tad bit too chocolate-y.   The shroom burger is meaty with a crispy shell. Upon biting into it, cheese oozes out and it's heavenly. It didn't even need ketchup.  Luckily, I came at 5pm so there was no wait. They give you a buzzer after you order and I only waited maybe a minute or so before my food was ready. I'll be back for sure!",

My favorites are the Shroom Burger and cheese fries. It's a nice touch to have local beer options.   A few things to note for first time visitors. 1. It's fast food, but you can't think of it as fast food. The quality is much higher which makes it more expensive. Think of it like going out to eat. 2. There will be a wait. Just expect it. Even opening day I waited 30 minutes. In Shake Shack world, that's not bad. 3. They have an app now that you can order food in advance. Use it.   Great place! I highly recommend a visit!",

    "text": "Guys, we need to talk... about SHAKE SHACK!  Everyone and their brother have been beating the Shake Shack drum since they announced groundbreaking. As for me, I'm a big fan of local burgers but I'm open to friendly competition. After all, any opposition is either going to highlight better restaurants or force the homestead players to innovate and do better. Shake shack will definitely be ruffling some feathers with their remarkable burgers and high-quality ingredients.  I suggest you go in forgetting any prenotions that you've heard about the place. Just compare it to your favorite burger joint, hole-in-the-wall or upscale, doesn't matter. Everyone else has heard the good word already and the line is going to be unimaginable. I almost left when I pulled up on their second day open because the line was 3/4 wrapped around the building. I decided see how it was moving and to my surprise, they we're churning at 5-6 people a minute. Yeah, I'm game!  What made the wait even better was that they were giving out free samples to the peeps in line. I got to try the raspberry ginger lemonade and two different concretes before ordering, awesome! From the back of the line (estimate 110+ people) to the service counter was less than 25 minutes. It gave me plenty of time to choose my burger: Double SmokeShack with Lettuce & Tomato. The counter staff greet you with a \"Hey, what's shakin'?!\" and I thought it was cute and really breaks the ice nicely.  From the counter to walking out the door with my bag was maybe 5 minutes, great considering how busy it was. I unwrapped my burger as soon as I got to the car and took a moment to adore the perfect char on the outer rim of the patties. Seasoned perfectly, wonderful ShackSauce that is similar to just about any burger joint's \"Special\" sauce, only better. Fresh veggies and great proportions, and the BUN. Oddly enough the bun was slightly squishy/springy (imagine an Asian steamed bun, only starchier). It was the perfect vessel for such a great burger. Price-wise it was up there a bit, but it was one of the best burgers I've had from a restaurant in this neighborhood.  Fries were good, not \"blow your socks off\" but they had a consistent texture and flavor. Not surprisingly, they are definitely par cooked and frozen, and there's nothing really wrong with that, especially considering the size of the company. Once restaurant chains get bigger than a dozen or so stores, most go to the frozen route because otherwise they must test the sugar content of every shipment of potatoes that come in, per FDA nutritional reporting guidelines. That being said, they were really good fries. I wish I had asked for some extra ShackSauce to dip them in, but I got ketchup instead.  Long story short, don't let the lines scare you away. They are going to be slammed for the foreseeable future and have already built up enough rapport to commit to a second restaurant in the QC. It's a damn good burger, just make sure your schedule allows the wait!",

    "text": "Shake Shack, Shake Shack, what's with all the hype around Shake Shack?  Well, for starters, they make a damn good burger and fries.   Stopped by here after the lunch rush on a break and finally got to see (and taste) what all the fuss is about. It's a nice building with lots of stainless steel design and huge windows for lots of natural light. When you walk up to the counter and order you get a little buzzer and when it goes off you can pick up your order from the kitchen window. I just ordered a simple hamburger and a side of fries but man were they delicious. You could tell the burger had been seasoned well, and it had those perfect little crispy edges you only get on a flat top. The insides of the bun were toasted (and lightly buttered?) to perfection but the outside was as soft as can be. This is easily in my top five burger at this point. Fries were, if possible, even better. They may be my favorite fries anywhere at the moment. Crinkle cut, incredibly crispy exterior but still soft inside and adequately salty. So, so good.  My only two minor complaints were time and price. It took a little longer than I expected for them to fire up a plain hamburger. Not incredibly slow, but enough to mention. Price being my other little hangup, a plain, no topping, single patty burger with a side of fries and no drink was $9. Now that's not too crazy given the quality, but two people dining with loaded two patty cheeseburgers, drinks and sides, you're really getting into sit down restaurant territory, not even counting if you want to try one of their shakes.   In conclusion I'm 100% sold on the quality. I don't know about all those crazy folks who waited hours in line when it opened, but it sure is yummy. Given the price and location though it might be more of an occasional indulgence for me.",

I mean I have had better burgers pretty much everywhere else I have been in my life. We each rated the burgers about 6/10. The Fanta Grape was good, and the strawberry shake was very good.  The fries? Ok, but somewhat unappetizing in appearance, and for a large order, they were actually quite small. I think I could lose weight eating those.  And the bill for that food? Over $28! Ridiculous! The millennials can keep this place. I am pretty sure I won't be back.",

To start off I've been to Shake Shack in NYC and the hype didn't hit me until the Queen City got their very own!   On this visit we ordered 2 single patty ShackBurgers and a Cookie Butter Concrete. I was most excited about the concrete but once I tasted it it didn't really excite me. The concrete wasn't mixed that well and there was just one big glob of Cookie butter in the whole dish. (Note this is the opening day so you've got to allow for some hiccups). The star of the show tonight was the burgers and the fries!!!   Now our order was togo since it was close to closing and I had the kiddos. So you know we grubbed on fries on the car ride home. The fries were amazing. Perfectly seasoned, fresh and hot! They didn't need anything else added to them ie ketchup, extra salt or even my southern staple: ranch.   We didn't eat the burgers until we got home. My nephew got his custom burger order: Cheese, Pickle and Ketchup only. The ketchup is in a dispenser on the side and I had to grab a few to add to the burger once we got home. I got mine with Lettuce, Pickle and Shacksauce. The pickles are crisp and there was just enough Shacksauce.   Just a note they don't have a kids menu (smaller kid size portions) but they do offer things kids would like like grilled cheese and hot dogs. My nephew was able to demolish a single patty Shackburger!   Now to top off the experience they have the most amazing young lady named Consuela working the pick up line. She was very entertaining and kept everyone's spirits up. She made customers shimmy/shake for their food and had a very fun conversation with my nephew using the pagers.   I'm really happy to have Shake Shack in the Park Road Shopping Center. They are a great addition. I can't wait for the menu to grow and to see what treats they have planned for the summer!!!

People wait in line outside in boiling sun. The least they could do is have a canopy for people having to wait outside. Employees are nice but nothing like was mentioned in the 60 Minutes piece done in Oct 2017. I feel more welcomed at Chick Fil-A across the street. No real need to go back. Mooyah Burgers at Sycamore Commons has my vote for best \"chain\" burger and fries.",

I would have given 5 starts because they deserve it for the quality of the food and taste of the burger but, they need to understand that any customer doesn't like to wait in a line which takes him about 15-30 minutes to get to the cashier just to place an order. Thats one of the points that you need to take care about and it would be great if you can have couple more registers open during weekends in rish hours, and the time to get the burger is about 45 minutes which is actually making the fame and the craze for this brand to fall apart. Now coming to the burger its amazingly delicious i had the chick n shack and it was so good fresh meat not too soggy not too crispy it has the perfect texture of s burger and the fries were decent. I loved it and woul like to come back if you'll would try to reduce the wait time.",

Grab menu before getting in line for efficiency. Moderate line, moved quickly. Staff is plentiful- mostly friendly & helpful. Son & I combined had their basic burger with bacon, cheeseburger, fries and shake. Both rated this a slightly better than average burger. Well cooked, juicy and crisp depending on thickness of Party- overall fairly thin. 11 year old says bacon 9/10, is overall burger 6/10. Cheeseburger was hot and gooey cheese, crisp onions & pickles. Found myself looking for \"more\" flavor. Overall 6/10 as well. Fries were hot, but \"freezer fries\". Milkshake (black & white) was thick & tasty. Glad we didn't wait long. .",

What, is the menu that complex? It's a burger joint! This place is a one and done. I can't see what the hype is all about unless the competition in NY was so lousy that people would gladly pay $5.29 for a $3.00 burger. My wife got their Shack-cago Dog, which JJ's on East runs circles around.  It was slightly better priced at $4.29. The French fries at $2.79 are over priced and rate as ok, crispy on the outside and mostly air inside - we termed them as air fries. The brand name may keep the people coming but the food won't be the reason to return.",

The cashier was friendly and answered my newbie questions before ordering.  The wait for the food to come out seemed a bit long given it wasn't very busy, but I appreciate that I would get fresh hot food.  The burger tasted like a hybrid of Steak & Shake and Freddie's Frozen Custard & Steak-burgers. The burger  patties are thin with the charred edges similar to the other places I mentioned.  It was \"Good.\" I'm not denying it was definitely tasty. The fries, I found remarkably unremarkable.  They are basic crinkle cuts that seemed like those I could make in the oven.  My real problem was the bill.  Now I will state that I spend a lot of money dining out and I don't mind running up a tab. If money is no object for you, go for it. For the cost of this meal I'd rather have someone bring it to me.  Our 2 burgers, before anything else were $20!  You might be saying well they must be real big burgers. They aren't. If you have any kind of appetite (and I do) you'll want something else. In summary Shake Shack has a tasty burger, unremarkable fries and a price that is a bit much for food I order at the counter.  I will give them a thumbs up for serving Coke Products.",

One customer even asked if they could open a third register and was rudely shut down. Multiple people who had ordered online and had a scheduled pick up were waiting even longer after arriving. Multiple staff members were taking breaks or messing around behind the counter and didn't seem concerned with all the people leaving or negative comments about the wait. I don't care how good the food is...it is not worth the hour+ long wait when we already have great spots like Soda Shoppe, Mr. K's and Brooks here in Charlotte!",

    "text": "My experience at Shake shack was very poor. I have been  multiple times but today was not one to make me come back. First of all, the prices are insane. I paid over 15 dollars for a \"float\", single burger, and cheese fries. The fries I ordered were very difficult to eat. They all broke up and it just become a pile of wet fries. Secondly, the float I ordered was not made. I went to go get my food and the women told me they ran out of vanilla custard. I was not that mad about that; however, she only offered to give me a new milkshake. Not a refund or anything like that. I ordered a chocolate milkshake and it was terrible. It was grainy and very milky. I did not enjoy it.  The people I was with also had their orders messed up. My friend ordered a milkshake and they made her pay for whip cream without asking. It was an extra 50 cents, and then when she got her milkshake there wasn't even any whipped cream! She obviously went and brought her shake asking for whipped cream, and the lady had the nerve to roll her eyes. Honestly I think this is very disrespectful and for the price you are paying, the customer service should be impeccable. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!",

Food- burger was tasty, fries were fine, shake was tasty too. This is obviously a fast casual/fast food place SO I don't like their pricing, too expensive. However, quality is better than fast food joints. I'm a firm believer in burger meals being cheap as they take no skill and they're made up of cheap ingredients too.  They had just opened and their floor was sticky and slippery (like greasy) all at the same time- wth? I was nervous for their older customers- it was that bad.  Can't give them more stars b/c after all the hype it was just a notch above fast food and too expensive. Charlotte is always TOO hype for new food places.",

I waited, too,  and paid nearly $25 for two burgers, regular fries, and a salted caramel milkshake (my wife and I split the meal).  The verdict?  Yepper, I'm a fan.  The combination of delicate (yet crispy) fries, juicy burgers on a potato bun, and that salted caramel milkshake might just be the best combo I've had in a long time.   Each on its own will probably find a better, less expensive victor.  But, not many places can put them all together well enough to warrant both the price and the demand.  Welcome to PRSC.  Nice to know I can walk to visit.  I say give 'em a whirl.",

If you're indecisive the employees are patient and helpful. For many years I've been obsessed with In-N-Out Burger. Now, Shake Shack has made its way into my heart!  There are several signature sandwiches to choose from along with hot dogs and french fry options. I ordered the single-Shack Burger with a strawberry shake and fries. The burgers are more expensive than I initially thought they'd be. They're a decent size, the beef was seasoned well and had those nice crispy bits that you get with a good smashed burger, the potato bun is soft and delicious.   By the way, I didn't realize you could order beer and wine? I look forward to enjoying a glass or two during my next visit.",

The burger was very tasty although once I was more than half way through I saw a little bit of pink....I'm not a pink girl. I like my meat brown all the way through. But it was still very tasty nevertheless. The cheese sauce on the fries was delish. Not to sharp not too mild. My hubby had a chicken dog with relish and mustard. He enjoyed it. And he also had a milkshake which of course he said was delish. I will get a shake next time. The price point was steep for a burger joint. 2 burgers, 1 regular fry, 1 cheese fry, lemonade and milkshake was just under $40. Was it worth it? Yes. I would say so. I plan to visit again in the future.",

Our second visit ended up being the complete opposite! Our food was EXTREMELY greasy & it took FOREVER to get our food.   On both occasions, I ordered their shack burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, & shack sauce. A single burger costs around $6 bucks & a double costs around $8. I decided to give the double a try on my second visit because I ended up leaving my first visit still hungry.... bad decision. The burger came out so greasy. It had soaked through the bun & you could see it on the lettuce. Not sure if the greasiness had to do with the double burger because I didn't have this issue with the single burger on my first visit.   Everything is overpriced in my opinion. The fries cost $2.79 & the milkshakes start around $6 bucks. They offer absolutely no meal options, so you have to order everything separate. My husband & I ended up paying close to $23 dollars WITHOUT drinks. Just seems high in my opinion.   The place does stay very busy! My husband & I usually have some trouble finding a table on the weekends. They do offer outdoor & indoor seating, which is nice. They also offer alcoholic beverages.   I do like the fact that they use 100% all natural angus beef. It has no hormones or antibiotics ever. I am a huge fan of eating food that is natural & better for your body.   Sadly, I'm not sure if I will be a repeat customer. My first experience was good, but my second was not up to par. I would save your money & just go to cookout. The food is cheaper & tastes better in my opinion!",

There are burger places all of the city and while they all serve their own style of Burger and some have gourmet option some have no options, Shake Shack has enough options.  The fries are always Crispy, the burgers always fresh and like most places you can add bacon and anything. If you're lucky and not there on the weekend the lines aren't to bad though even when they are slammed they get all registers going and the line moves fairly quickly.   FYI they have seasonal items that you can find out about on their website, the bbq chicken Sammy is really good though at the time I'm writing this, you cannot get it (sorry), it's not the least expensive place you could opt to get a burger either, I still think it's worth it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!",

So, not being a person who enjoys standing in line for hours for food I held off a few weeks before checking out the new location.  I stopped in several weeks after opening around 1:40ish, missing the lunch crowd. Luckily for me I only waited 10 minutes before ordering. Having never been I decided to try a few things, the Shake Shack Cheeseburger, added pickles, a classic Hot Dog and Fries. Overall I thought the burger and hot dog were okay, nothing outstanding....honestly I've had a better burgers elsewhere for cheaper. And, being a lover of Crinkle Fries, they were just plain blah! Not sure the issue but they weren't that fresh, I think they were sitting on the line waiting for the burger/Hot Dog to be ready, because they were cold and dry.  Overall, definitely glad I checked them out, their location is beautiful, but not sure this is where I would rush to when craving a burger.",

In terms of the fast casual joints like this (Five Guys, Smashburger, etc), I have to say I think Shake Shack's burger is better. My go-to order is: a Shackburger (add pickles), cheese fries, and a small root beer. The root beer is Abita on draft. Pro tip: you don't need a large, free refills. Chicken sandwich is good, but for me I've got to get a burger when I come here.   There will always be a line. If you want to avoid the wait, download the app, order ahead, and skip the line.  I love that they are involved in the community. Local brews from Lenny Boy, Appalachian Mountain, and Catawba Brewing Company. They also donate 5% of sales of their Pie Oh My to support Loaves and Fishes, a local non-profit that provides food for families in crisis here in Mecklenburg County.  Plenty of outdoor seating. The front parking lot is tiny, drive past it and look for a spot on the back side of the store.",

Went midweek so there wasn't a crazy line or anything and the service staff was very friendly.   We went with the newly advertised burger with bbq sauce and bacon and it was great. Nothing wrong with the burger at all! We got the bacon and cheese fries for the side and they are a must! Definitely not healthy in anyway but I don't mind that at all.   I'd say that the overall prices are a bit high. Worth it to me for a good lunch while strolling through NYC but your money can for so much more here in Charlotte. But hey. Go ahead and stop in and see what the hype is all about. Specially if you can't make it up to their flagship stores in NYC.",

One of my favorite things here is actually their Shack-cago Dog, though. I will say that while it's not technically authentic because there's no poppyseed bun, it is still enough to meet my craving because Matt's Chicago Dog is *never* fricking open when I'm near it and it's literally been years! Like, am I gonna have to take a day off work to get a hot dog?! I digress.  The fries are crinkly and very good when they're hot. I like them plain, with cheese or with chili and cheese.   The Shackmeister Ale is a decent pale ale, so I usually get that, but I do want to try one of those million calorie shakes. Maybe next time!   I'd definitely recommend this place if you want a good burger and fry meal. It's a contender!",

    "text": "I got to go to Shake Shack before they opened as part of a Charlotte Agenda event and just recently went back again.   Both times I was there, the service was great. After being open for several months, the line is still consistently out the door. It does move pretty fast though. They are also pretty fast to prepare your food. Because it's still so crowded, it's hard to find a seat inside. There were plenty of tables outside in the sun, but it's not ideal in the Charlotte summer heat.   We got the double BBQ bacon burger, the BBQ bacon cheddar fries, the cherry pie concrete, and the cookie butter concrete. Last time, I got the double shack burger, cheddar bacon fries, and a double blueberry pie concrete.   I loved the BBQ featured items. The peppers on the Shack Burger were a little too spicy for me. The burgers are much higher quality than your typical fast food. The concretes are to die for.   As much as I love the food, I don't think it's worth the price. A double burger costs almost $10. It's definitely worth trying, but I can't justify coming back very often when it's that expensive for something that's still high quality fast food.",

    "text": "I have had Shake Shack in NY and when I found out it was coming to Charlotte I was so happy. Little did I know I was better off going to Wendy's and saving a couple dollars too then eating here. Shake Shack is so overrated and not worth the time, money or energy to stand in line and wait for a mediocre burger. The fries I remembered in NY were so much better than the fries we got in Charlotte.   I was instantly over the hype and I am so glad I  didn't wait in a line so I could get darker and possibly sunburned. Yes brown people can get sunburned too.  I really want to order a bacon cheeseburger from Wendy's and order a Shake Shack burger and do a blind test with random people and see which one they think is better.   My guess is that Wendy's would win the challenge because we all know that if it was 5 guys in that taste test there would be no competition. Please save your money and skip this place completely and go to Wendy's for a better burger. I don't even want to tell you to go to Bang Bang Burger because you would just felt like you literally lit your money on fire by going to Shake Shack .   Even being this critical about their burgers I think the shakes and ice cream are the way to go as I'll give this place another try just to review the shakes and ice cream because the name is Shake Shack.  I'm glad they didn't name it Burger Shake because I would tell them their name needs to change. My thoughts on their burgers will not change",

I ordered two chocolate milkshakes and a chocolate malt. We waited and waited and then we started to notice that the people behind us had already gotten their food. After waiting for about 20 to 25 minutes, our food was ready. I personally have tasted better chocolate shakes than this one but chocolate isn't my favorite flavor of milkshake. I would like to go back and try the burgers and fries just to see if it is really worth it. Overall I probably would not recommend this to a friend but I would recommend \"Burger Fi\" which looks the exact same on the inside and I really enjoy their milkshakes!",

Although we got fries, he was still hungry off of one burger, and I felt really bad.   The \"Blood Orange Ginger\" Lemonade literally just tasted like regular lemonade with 90 pounds of sugar. Shake Shack is WAY too expensive for a tiny burger. I would recommend Zinburger or Smashburger or even Five Guys to get your money's worth to be completely honest.

    "text": "This is the casino of fast food.  You go in knowing the house is going to rip you off, but the novelty of this joint is what makes going at least once mandatory.  My wife and I went to an early movie and for the first time there was no line at around 9:30 on a Friday night.  I ordered a double shack burger and an order of fries, while the Misses had a single with a strawberry shake.  Total bill was $23 for four items.  The burger was tasty, but come on, $8 for a double burger ought to include the fries.  The wife's shake appeared to be about 12 fluid ounces.  For slightly less money, you can go around the corner and visit Smashburger which the food is about the same quality, or you could go over to Zack's Hamburgers and get a Zack Special for about half the price of The Shack.  As a matter of fact when we were watching the movie \"American Animals\" I told the wife that one scene looked like Zack's, and found out later that the movie was filmed in Charlotte and that was Zack's Hamburgers.  They don't make movies at bland establishments like Shake Shack, but they do at Zack's where you can go for the ambiance but stay for the food!",

    "text": "DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!  With that said by all means go try it and see for yourself this place is nothing more than a trendy overhyped overpriced waste of time.  I will say the Order via App option is solid and worked perfectly, food was ready promptly when promised and line was skipped accordingly.    Someone said that this is the new best burger in Charlotte that is laughable at best.  I would obviously rank it above any of your big fast food chains, McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King etc etc it blows them away and it should.  It might be on par with 5 guys but for me falls below smash burger, hwy 55 and Culver's and wayback burgers which are your typical fast casual burger places and I feel offer a better product.  And I wouldn't even rank it with non chain places because it's not even in the same ball park.    I tried double shack burger, the fried chicken sandwich the cheese fries, cheese is on the side, and a orange creamsicle float.  First things first the burger, meat quality is good, it had a nice char on the meat, taste was slightly above average but I found it to be overly salty for my tastes.  Chicken sandwich was excellent but you will still find better at a Chick-fil-A, sauce they use on the chicken sandwich was very very good.  Fries were good, crinkle cut and crispy on the outside, slightly different crinkle cut than the super mass produced shape most places serve, cheese sauce was meh for me, glad it was on the side I didn't really like it, it's suppose to be a blend of American and cheddar I believe but overall just lacked flavor for me.  My orange creamsicle float consisted of them handing me a cup with a small amount of ice cream/custard in the bottom and pointing me at the drink machine to fill it with orange soda, the order was to go I'm assuming if you dined in they might construct it for you but I could be wrong.    There shakes which they are named after are $5+ which to me is laughable, now I don't mind spending money on food but to not offer any size option and have one price for a shake I think is kinda bad practice. My friend tried the shakes and said they weren't that good, they didn't even finish them and threw part of them out,  I will go back to try a shake just so I know for myself but I'm not expecting much.    I have to commend them on their hype/advertising you would think it's the best food in the world and it was free if you just look at how busy they are and how long the line usually around the outside of the building is.  But for me that's all it was is a trendy overhyped place, if you want a better burger there are many many options available to you, and if you want a good milkshake for a lower price then you also have plenty of local options.  When I'm craving a burger I will go out of my way for a good place, this is not one of those places for me.  I will not say I'm never eating there again but I doubt I'll be back very much in the future just not worth it to me.   I know food and I know burgers and this place is average at best, there are worse options and there are better options.  So go try it for yourself, form your on conclusion, and leave your own yelp review!",

Also since I don't eat red meat, I was happy to hear that they have a vegetarian burger option! When we arrive, there was literally no parking and the line was super long even after a week it had open AND the fact that this was a Tuesday. Notta problem because it moved fairly quickly. I ordered the mushroom burger, crinkle cut fries & shack sauce of coursee! The mushroom had cheese oozing out of it when you take a bite, yumm. I've never been a fan of crinkle cut fries but I gotta say it was pretty good! They were perfectly crispy. Shack sauce, hm it was alright nothing compared to in and out sauce (hehe)  also I recommend ordering the pie & icecream it was really yummy!",

My girlfriend had been hyping it up for a long time, and since this location had recently opened up, I just had to see the hype.   It's a small burger with the price tag of a large burger. I ordered the Chik'n burger, and my gf ordered the Shroom Burger. We both enjoyed it, however, she was obviously full of one. I was still hungry. We ordered fries as well which were tasty especially with all of the sauces to dip it in. The \"Blood Orange Ginger\" Lemonade literally just tasted like regular lemonade with 90 pounds of sugar.

    "text": "I honestly don't understand the hype around this restaurant. We happened to be at the AMC and they had their lobby closed so were allowing outside food.   We saw Shake Shack and decided to try it. The menu is simple, burgers, chicken sandwich, chicken bites and shakes. I haven't had a burger in forever and decided to try one. Plus the menu is seriously lacking healthy options. Even fast food places offer salad and other options than fries as sides. Maybe I overlooked these on the menu. And everything is separate. No combo savings here. We ordered to go and it took about ten minutes to get our food. They were pretty busy.   So I ordered a single shackburger with fries and a drink. The burger was just okay and usually if I'm starving and haven't eaten bad in a while, it will taste like the best thing ever. This did not. Burger was flavorless and couldn't even taste the special sauce. Fries were just okay. They were crisp but nothing special.  Overall, it was overcrowded, overpriced with limited options. And then just okay food. I appreciate their environment friendly packaging, but my husband and I both don't really desire to go back.",

    "text": "Shake Shack is in Charlotte... I guess that means we are a large city now?  It's great to see popular chains \"break ground\" in the QC because that means we have a large enough, and desirable enough market to be in.  I've had Shake Shack a couple times with my trips to Chicago so I already knew what to expect.  Unfortunately the Shake Shack in Chicago that I frequented wasn't the best, so I was cautiously optimistic about this location in Charlotte.  Being in Park Rd Shopping Center, it's a great location right off the bat.  I believe the Monkey Joes that used to occupy this space was demo'ed and a new, stand-alone building was built just for the Shack.  The parking lot/ traffic flow leaves a lot to be desired as there is a one-way road that loops back around the building, but it was definitely inconvenient that someone had blocked the drive to run in and get an online order or pick-up.  Either way, just be careful maneuvering around the parking lot.  I'll just chalk it up to it being \"new\" but I'll also mostly blame just people in general.  So I ended up parking in the \"back side\" of the building so I walked through the dining room to get to the registers.  The staff was super friendly and I knew the drill.  I still don't know if having the menu to where it is visible from the line is a great idea or a drawback cause there is no reference once you approach the register so there's a lot of swiveling heads.  Placed my order for a chicken shack, cheese fries, and a milkshake and was given a buzzer.  Everything is made-to-order but it's pretty quick.    The sandwich was solid and the crinkle cut fries were nice and crisp, the cheese on them were a bonus.  The black and white milkshake was delicious, but I had this feeling I had to workout the next two days to undo my intake from this meal.  Overall it was a solid experience.  It was a weeknight and there was a steady flow of people.  I can't imagine that the line is like on the weekends... oh, but I have definitely driven by and seen the line, literally out the door.",

The location is right in Montford and has plenty of parking in the park road shopping center.   One of the reasons I gave it three stars is because for basically a fast food joint, it's not very fast lol. I'm not sure how long it takes to cook a burger and warm up some fries, but it seems to take forever to get your food. There's lots of indoor and outdoor seating, so if the place is packed, you're gunna be waiting.   The hubs swears by their milkshakes. Like, really loves them. So if you like shakes, try them out. Patio seating is nice and also dog friendly, bonus! It doesn't do it for me, but try it out and make your own opinion!",

I usually order a cheeseburger with lettuce, onion, and pickles. I get the shack sauce on the side. I love them. They really make a great burger.   I don't care much for the hot dogs, just my preference. I also don't like the milkshakes that much either. Here's why: they are really pricey, they are extremely thick, and the flavor (chocolate in particular) wasn't doing it for me. This is only my opinion, because I know plenty of people who love them. The fries are just ok, while I love crinkle fries, I think the ones at Shake Shack are coated with something a little different. I do eat some it they are at the table, I don't hate them, they are just not my favorite.  The waits are killer. I downloaded the app to avoid them, because they just take to long to get through. I recommend 100% getting the app. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes the staff is really nice and sometimes really frustrated or possibly annoyed.   All in all, I like this place. I will be back continuously for the cheeseburgers. I may even try the hot chicken or grilled cheese. Stay tuned for future updates.",

My Shack burger I customized slightly with pickles and a little mustard. They let me add the pickles for no charge, yay. The burger was a good solid burger but not quite on my top 10. There just wasn't anything outstanding or impressive about it.  Shake Shack was great to try while I was in the area, though I might not go out of my way for it.

    "text": "Shake Shack's burgers are amazing. They're normally cooked medium but they will cook then to whatever temperature you want. It's all made to order too and the flavor definitely tells. If you have any dietary restrictions they'll work to get you something you can eat. And what burger goes without fries? Their fries are fresh and taste even better with their melty cheese sauce. They've also got milkshake and concretes made with custard rather than ice cream so if dairy doesn't agree with you, you'll love these. There's almost always a long line so don't come if you're in a super big rush but you are able to order online to skip the line. Just be aware of what time it is when you plan to go there.",

    "text": "For a fast casual burger, they've got good flavor (their special sauce) and crispy patties. Service is fairly quick and the inside is clean.  I recommend the classic Shackburger, which has their special Shack sauce. If you want all the toppings, just ask, otherwise it comes classic with tomatoes and lettuce. Definitely get a side of crinkle fries, which are super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside -- as they should be. If you want to do it right, getting a shake for your fries is a good move.   Their Pie Oh My dessert uses local Suarez bakery pie. They also support local with their drink options.   The line is usually long, but it's gotten smaller now that it's not the new hotspot around town anymore. In general, it's always best to go before 12 or after 12 but not directly at noon if you want to avoid the biggest crowd of the day.",

I feel like if my stomach didn't hurt so much in the first place I would of enjoyed this more.   This place was so crowded-- like I'd expected, Charlotte NC being as stressful as it is, we could not find parking for like 20 minutes, but stuck with it because I really wanted to try shake shack but didn't think I'd be going to NYC anytime soon. I ordered the most basic entree I think. The shack burger and fries. Comes with cheese, tomato and lettuce. It was fine. I guess their wow factor that I did not love at the time was the the burger patty it's self was like smashed and it was kind of crispy.. I guess I just like a thick juicy burger.. I also feel like they were supposed to have some secret sauce, my burger was loaded with mayo, which did not make my stomach feel too great.    I liked the fries though.. they were super crispy and crinkle cut. I'd definetly try it again, and I hope next time I have a different experience.",

When my food came up he put it on a tray for in house dining. I told him it was to go. He ignored me. I repeated myself and he says \"I know!\" He then starts moving super slow and puts my drink back. I told him that's my drink. I'm upset now. I told him \"c'mon now, no need to act like that towards me.\" He said \"you have an attitude\" I told him no I don't. He told me to \"chill out.\" I said \"I am a grown up and you dont speak to me in that way!\" I couldnt ask for a manager because everyone disappeared until I left. My daughter was waiting for me in her car. I told her what happened and she went back inside to tell a manager what happened. He informed her that the young man was about to be pulled off the line to be spoken to about the situation. Hopefully someone will contact me from the message I left.",

We ordered burgers, fries, and unsweet tea. They don't give you a cup for the tea, like they do for soft drinks, they give it to you when your food is ready. We order and wait 20 minutes for our pager to finally buzz. 20 minutes without a drink was quite disappointing.   Then we wait at the counter another 5 minutes for them to hand us the food. The \"side\" of sauce I was given was truly laughable (see picture). It was enough for 2 fry dips. I returned to the counter to request more sauce and a drink refill a bit later and of course it was much more waiting and I eventually just gave up.   Food was ok but nothing special. Burgers are really thin. Can't get refills on tea without a long wait, and they don't have sweets-n-low. The place was a cluster of confusion, did not have enough employees, and I won't be back.",

I would swear that God was one of the cooks myself. It was so delicious, not in a wagyu kind away but in the way that everything melted in my mouth. And please keep in mind I have braces so that is is extremely important. The fries were so delicious. I was suggest that you paraben with any beer they have on their selection, preferably an IPA.",

I did have some enjoyable conversation with others who also thought their order was ready. I think the volume of customers and the demand on the kitchen makes it difficult for them to keep up. I will admit that the food was worth the wait.  I had the double smoke burger. It was very tasty. I also had the shackstack concrete. I enjoyed it thoroughly. My wife had the single cheeseburger and a  vanilla milkshake. She received a chocolate milk shake and she didn't like the taste of it. When she finally got her vanilla milk shake, she loved it.

Alcohol, nice but really burgers go better with Coke or a shake than a smooth cab. The atmosphere was pleasant but not over the top. The burger.... the fries has anyone heard of Five Guys? I mean we aren't even talking comparison. Shack's fries are like the kind you heat up in the oven from the frozen food section of the grocery, the kind with the ridges that taste like freezer burn. We ate maybe half. As for the Burger.... I was with a friend at The Smith in New York two weeks ago. He had a burger. Halfway through the juice from the burger has disintegrated the bun on the bottom. I remarked that was a sign of a good burger. Shack's bun was intact all the way through. The meat was crunch rather than juicy. The add ons were undistinguishable. Bad, no, really boring, absolutely. Would I go back, sure if someone in a group insisted. Otherwise, head to Five Guys. If you need alcohol, do takeout. All hype. I've now had Shake Shack and Five Guys is still the best burger I have ever had.",

The burgers and fries were indeed tasty but at the price point offered I thought they would be bigger and have a better flavor. While a burger shop like this is a great addition to the Woodlawn area for those looking to avoid the bar scene with it's dingier aspects, there are a lot of places to get a better burger not too far outside of the neighborhood.

If you are after a really good burger try Fenwick's on Providence Road.   10/11/2018 This is my second visit. Because of my first review I wrote Shake Shack comped me a burger and fries.   Now that things have settled down I would say things have improved. This time I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. I put mustard on the CB. The cheeseburger looks small but that's deceptive. The burger is rich and very filling. Fries were hot and crispy. If they learned how to make onion rings like South 21 on Independence Blvd. They would have a real hit. Shake Shack, check out South 21. And try a burger at Finwick's. You will be happy you did.",

    "text": "So, never had a burger from shake shack...heard all the buzz about their burger and how delicious it is.  I've heard this before about another burger joint out in the wild west and I went in and out of that place.  Their burger was okay and maybe too much hype about their burgers made with sauce from animals or something.   ;-) I was pretty disappointed in that other experience and didn't think it was that \"awesome.\"    So back to Shake Shack...I was expecting a similar situation with hype over heat.  I ordered a Shack burger, double pattie all the way (the way it has it on the menu).  Also ordered crinkle cut fries (normal) and a desert \"Oh my pie\" (custard with blueberry pie), which we put on hold until we finished our food.  So the burger...the patties are pretty thin patties (not a thick fat juicy burger) so I'm glad I got the double.  But even though they are thin, they were pretty MOIST, which was a plus (a bit greasy, but not sure what you'd expect from burger). It was good!!  Overall, I was happy with my burger.    The crinkle cut fries were hot, fresh and pretty crunchy.  Kudos for not giving me greasy fries.  The wife enjoyed the fries...and she loves her fries.    Now, for desert.  We are a fan of A custard place that is Good and they have berries.  Shake shack isn't as good as that place (to be fair, Shake shack is known for their burgers and that other place is known for their custards), but still was pretty good.    So overall, very pleased with the food and the service.  I would definitely recommend this place and would revisit in the future.  If you are looking for a decent burger place, give this place a try.",

I was truly disappointed.  The burger was mediocre at best, the fries were cold, and the young lady at the register and beverage station was totally confused.  At the register we were told our drinks would be prepared with or meal, we received the meal...no drinks.  I had to explain what we'd ordered all over just for the young lady to start talking to someone else when I was mid-statement.  Then she comes back to me and greets me like I wasn't just talking. One of my beverages was a \"fifty-fifty\" which was described as a tea/lemonade mix. The young lady asks, what did you want in your 50/50? Ummmm...exactly as it's described on the menu.  Next stop, condiments station...which we had to squeeze between 2 of the staff.  It appeared the were on break which the chose to enjoy in the middle of the walkway, while looking at the customers as if they were bothering them for trying to squeeze through for beverages, bathroom and drinks.  The final verdict...I will not revisit Shake Shake. Specially not this location...",

The burger was very flavorful, the bun was soft, the fries were crunchy & crispy, while moist and filled with potato flavor, without being over-cooked! Really good crispy, but not overdone fries like this are not easy to make! To finish off the meal I got a (small!) shake, and it was fantastic too! And if atmosphere means anything to you, you'll find it's great too! Absolutely not what I was expecting from \"fast food\" at all. In fact, it feels like a disservice to call them a \"fast food\" place; they're leagues apart and above the places most of us think of as fast food!  As far as I could tell, everything was made from fresh, basic, simple, REAL food. Nothing tasted artificial...it just tasted great!  It's probably not a place to go if you're looking to cut calories, but I fully admit, I went in as a 1st time visitor planning on a cheeseburger, fries, and a shake, so I didn't even notice if they had salads or other lower calorie options. I'm confident that if they do, they're made from the same kind of fresh and tasty ingredients.   Just typing this review makes my mouth water!",

But.... the times ive been its not because they are that busy. Its been due to the cashiers (only 2)showing no sence of urgency.

The bun was flattened and didn't really fill out the wrapper it was put in.  The patty was decently seasoned and enjoyable.  However, when comparing to similar quality burgers, it did not stand out.  Value - 2/5 - These things are damn expensive.  Family of 4 in front of me walked away with a $60 tab.    TL;DR - If someone asked me if I wanted to go to shake shack with them I'd say \"Fine\".

    "text": "It's as good in the south as it is in the \"north\". My first time at Shake Shack was years ago in DC. I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it today. I got the Shack burger with the shack sauce on the side, fried and a drink. The burger was delicious and it's well seasoned for a fast food burger. They cook them as they're ordered, so they're not sitting under one of those heat lamps. My burger still had some pink in the middle, which I didnt mind bc I like my burgers medium. I'm not a fan of crinkle cut fries, but the fries at Shake Shack are pretty good. They're crispy, which I like because often times, crinkle cut fries can be soggy, especially if they're cooked from frozen. I must have picked the sweet spot time and day because there was no line. I walked in and ordered my food, the cashier said it would be 7-10 mins and it was less wait time than that. Shake Shack does have vegetarian offer, they have a mushroom steak burger. They also have chiken sandwiches and hot dogs. It's a fast casual place but if they got a drive thru location, that would be bomb. They have high top community style tables as well as low top tables and booths. They also have outdoor seating. I'll be back when I want a quick burger as long as there's no ridiculous line outside.  Update: so I'm not really ashamed to say this, but I came back two days later. This time I got the bbq and smoked cheddar bacon burger. Their bbq sauce is pretty good on the burger. It's not too sweet and it's a bit tangy.",

    "text": "Shake shack just (well, kind of...) opened up in Charlotte and I had to try it! I'm a fan of the original locations in NYC, so I wanted to see how Charlotte stacked up. In short: Charlotte Shake Shack makes a great burger (especially compared to the burger competition nearby), but it can't beat other Shake Shack locations.  I got a burger and their signature fries. The burger was okay: the patty was a little dry, but it was hot and everything worked well together. The brioche-style bun was great, too. The real star here was the fries, though. They're crinkle fries just the way I like them- crispy on the outside and softer in the middle! With some extra crispy ones throughout, of course.   The vibe in Shake Shack is great. I think families could definitely come here (lots of booths!), and it would be perfect for watching a game too- lots of big TVs. Overall, SS was so close to being a new staple in my book, but I think I'll be hesitant coming back (though those fries were delicious).",

    "text": "Shake shack... is shake shack. I've been to Shake Shack before in DC and knowing that it opened in Charlotte I wanted to check the place out. And well, it was exactly what I expected, minus the amount of people that was lined up outside the restaurant about an hour before closed.   I ordered some smoke shack burgers, however I did ask for a lettuce wrap which I can confidently say that Shake Shack does do. The only problem with their lettuce wrap burger is that it's not the greatest. Granted they are known for their potato buns but, for me I am always trying to find ways to cut down the carbs if it's possible. We had a huge order, and let's just say they're not that great at that, so my experience was a little different than others.  This Shake Shack needs to still fix logistics problems and get faster with getting their orders out. So, I don't think it's perfect and there is still definitely work that still has to be done.  Price wise... I think it's a little high for the burgers. They aren't the most amazing burgers, and I sort of still think for fast food burgers (on the East Coast) for lettuce wrap burgers for me... Five Guys still holds supreme. But if it's on the West Coast, In-n-Out all day. And you will definitely be asked which is better if you've been to both. People in Charlotte now have the chance to weigh in on their opinions.   Overall, Shake Shack isn't bad. It's actually pretty awesome. I think that this location needs to speed up their orders, but it's understandable that they have a line and it's pretty hyped. And also, it's nice to see it get to Charlotte. Definitely recommend you to try it out if you haven't gotten the chance to. Just know that you will probably encounter a line.",

I don't remember the prices being as high as they were in Vegas but we spent about $50 on 2 double burgers, 2 chicken sandwiches, 2 cheese fries, a drink and a milkshake which is insane...  But all in all I still enjoyed the burgers they were made to order with fresh ingredients, loved the crinkle cut fries, not a huge fan of the chicken sandwich but at least we tried a variety of items on the menu to know what is good. I'm sure we will be back.",

    "text": "Call it hype if you want but if anyone finds anything wrong with these burgers, your taste buds are either in need of a tune up or you just don't know what a good burger is. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  I came here on opening day in hopes of being one of the first 100 in line to get a free hat but after lollygagging at home, I didn't get there until 10:30 and by then the line was wrapped around the building.  Despite the fact that we knew we wouldn't get a hat we wanted to eat because we knew what was in store for us. I've been to the NY and DC locations and when I found out that Charlotte would get the first Shake Shack in NC, I was ecstatic.  We met some really awesome people in line and ended up eating with them, being on NBC News Charlotte's facebook live broadcast and live tv broadcast.  How fun! Got my 15 minutes of fame. Ha! Well after an hour and a half we made it into the doors and considering there were probably almost 200 people in line before us, it wasn't bad.  They had so many people working and they were ready! We (had my teenagers with me) ordered three single shack burgers and added onions on it for no extra charge, some fries and soft drinks with some Shack Sauce on the side. We sat outside on the spacious patio and despite how busy they were, there was still plenty of seating. We took pics and then dug in!  What can I say? Worth. The. Wait.  Now, I'm not a big crinkle cut fry fan but since I've had them before, I knew what I was getting.  Everyone at our table loved their food and the manager even brought out a blueberry pie concrete dessert for us to try.  The pie is from Suarez Bakery and proceeds go to a local charity, Loaves and Fishes.  If you're not familiar with Shake Shack ask Uncle Google and he can lead you to Wikipedia or some other informative site and you can get the low down. They also have chicken sandwiches, a meat free portabella burger, and other toppings include cherry peppers, Niman Ranch bacon, cheese lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc. Fries can be plain, cheese or bacon and cheese, hot dogs with fixings, and a chicken, apple and sage sausage. On the cool side they have milkshakes, floats, cups and cones and concretes. Drinks include lemonade, iced tea, root beer, fountain soda and assorted beer and wine.   They even have something for dogs, yes dogs! Pooch-ini which is ShackBurger dog biscuits, peanut butter sauce and vanilla custard. Not intended for small dogs it says. It says to just let small dogs have a lick or two. Second on the doggie menu is Bag o' Bones which is 5 ShackBurger dog biscuits. There's a water bowl and a place to \"tie\" your pooch up while you go inside.  Not sure if they allow dogs in the patio area but only service dogs are allowed inside. I love dogs but I'm not a fan when places allow dogs in the eating areas. Most owners are considerate that not everyone loves dogs nor wants to eat with them but some just seem to be oblivious. So that's it in a nutshell. They will be opening a location in the Blakeney Shopping Center and will be taking over half the space of Bravo which will be shutting down in a few days.  I'm really excited for that and this time I plan to be in line to be in the first 100. I'm ready to go back already. Dinner anyone? That is all!",

I still hold the same opinion about the fries, drinks & regular burgers as before. But this chicken sandwich has changed my life! This visit we also tried the Smoke Stack and the Cherry Pie Oh My. The smoke stack was okay, It was larger and more filling. Definitely enjoyed the Smokey bacon flavor but I didn't personally care for the cherry pepper relish. The pie oh my is still unique and delicious. Although this time the pie to vanilla custard ratio was off and I felt like there was only a tiny sliver of pie in there.",

    "text": "I was finally able to get in the door and find a seat. In the past every time we would think about coming the line was way too long. I now realize that one reason the line is long is due to the proximity of the front door and the ordering line. Also everything is cooked to order which is awesome. Finally it's because the burgers are delicious.   The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and patient. They explained the menu options and were in no way in a hurry. We ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries, 1 sweet tea and 1 water. Our order totaled  just above $30!!  Our burgers: Double Bbq bacon cheddar and a double cheeseburger. Additionally we had 1 regular fry and 1 bbq cheese bacon fry.  The burgers are very good. The meat and topping are fresh and make to order. The fries are fries. They are crinkle cut but nothing to write home about. The bacon was crispy and plentiful which are 2 qualities I enjoy in bacon.  I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I can't because of the price. The service was good but there is no table service it's fast food style seating. So overall it was a good burger but not the best, and it was pricey.",

Ordered two burgers to go.    We like the shack stack more than the smoke shack.  The smoke shack has spicy peppers (pickled), spicy and sour, i think the taste doesnt blend with burger.  Overall it is also more saltier than the shack stack.  However, we enjoy the shack stack, the breading on the portabella mushroom well stick together and didn't fall off after the first bite.  However, for 2 burgers only that cost close to $18 is quite expensive.  I wish they have the option for how the Patty is cook, we love medium raw.",

The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were crispy and hot. I took a bite before I remembered to take a picture, but I did manage to get one in lol. Also, I'm not sure if it was just me, but I totally fell in love with the sweet tea there. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was spacious and clean. I sat indoors, but the outside patio area looked inviting and several patrons took advantage of it. If you like really good burgers I recommend you give this place a shot. The sure I'll be back.",

The food was not up to par i spent $14 my friends together spent $31 they ordered milkshakes which they said weren't cold all the way through i had cheese fries barely any cheese on them and they had a weird taste i would prefer Wendy's fries to these the burger was okay nothing special the bun was too small for the patty and was soggy they were also out of grape Fanta which is okay but for what I'm paying i expect to get the drink i wanted one of my friends pointed out they had crap WiFi so if you're going to finish uploading a paper go somewhere else all in all i won't be returning not worth the 25 minute drive or the money spent on the food",

Let me start by saying we were very excited to try this new place! After waiting in line for over 30 minutes, we were finally inside which we expected given that it is new. Unfortunately what we found once inside were tables full of people still without food, visibly frustrated and multiple people at the register saying they had been waiting over an hour since ordering! The menu looks great and I'm sure they'll work out the kinks, but they were way overwhelmed and could not keep up. Hopefully they'll figure out how to speed things up. Until then I'd recommend staying away.",

    "text": "I don't get the hype at all. For months there was a perpetual buzz that Shake Shack was coming, and after seeing the long lines out the door in the first week, I assumed there must be something special about this place.  So I gave it a try tonight for the first time.  I just don't get it. The burgers were relatively small for the price, were greasy, and lacked much flavor.  (Especially disappointing was the mushroom burger, which was fried and was filled with a messy albeit utterly flavorless cheese-like substance.  At least the beef-based burgers vaguely resembled a hamburger taste.)   Likewise, the \"concrete\" shake was nothing to write home about--just a very expensive ($7) cup of ice cream with minimal add-in.  Even the service was lackluster; the entire wait staff with whom I came in contact lacked any smiles or charisma.  I assume all these people who were abuzz about this fast food place coming to Charlotte must have never eaten a really good burger (and/or must be from out of town). The old standby Rusty's Deli beats this place by a mile with their larger, tastier burgers.   Even other chains such as American Burger and Five Guys are superior.  Or if you want much higher class without a much higher price tag, head down a few blocks to Cafe Monte. That's just the tip of the iceburg--with Zack's, Brooks, Bang Bang, Bad Daddy's, Bedder Bedder & Moore, the list goes on.  I'm sorry, Shake Shack, but you don't even break into my top 20 in Charlotte.  I won't be back.  I couldn't help but notice the lines are already appreciably shorter than a week ago, as I think quite a few first-timers like I have now become last-timers.",

I took my sister with me to experience her first time going and needless to say she and I both were very disappointed. We went in the middle of the weak about 3pm it wasn't very busy. The location was clean and well kept. There was a little confusion when entering because we weren't sure if people were in line or looking at the menu being that the menu is only on the wall in front of the register and there's not a lot of space. The cashier had an attitude which I guess was from no one answering when she called next. Her voice was very faint so you actually had to zone in on her to read her lips to say next. We ordered the same thing a double shack burger, a basket of fries and a cookies and cream shake. Spending over $31 in total. The burger were smaller than what I remembered. There wasn't that many fries in our basket. We both had a problem with our shakes not being cold all the way through. Meaning some sips were cold and some were warm. It got to the point where we both couldn't finish the shake because the constant switch between cold and warm was making our stomach hurt. Which was pretty annoying paying over $5 for a shake and not finishing it. Overall wasn't a good experience. Won't be returning because it wasn't worth the long drive and the overpriced food for the poor quality.",

This place had big expectations to fill...I love five guys and burgerfi, smash burger, and in and out...these are great burger places. But seriously shake shack....Like what? I literally don't understand the hype?? We sat there eating and being in utter confusion. When we would drive by each time it was lined out the door so we figured it had to be good...well it's a great marketing ploy...there is a line outside wrapping around because as soon as you walk in there is the register and no where else to stand so the only place left is outside which explains why people are always in line outside. I love hamburgers and went in there diving into the full experience. My fiance and I both got the double shackburger, order of fries each, a milkshake each and then I got a small soda. For two ppl it cost $40! For 2 burger, 2 fries, one drink, 2 shakes. But it wasn't even the price it was the taste of the food. It was sub-par...burgers had no taste...at all...fries were crinkle cut and again taste wasn't there and it tasted like the frozen crinkle fries u put in the oven. The shakes were really bad...I mean really bad...I got vanilla and my fiance got the marshmallow chocolate chip and they weren't good...in fact pretty gross...we took two sips and trashed them. Let me tell u this-I definitely will not be back and will go to the other burger joints in the area-smash burger and five guys...great burgers and fries. I see this place getting a lot of customers at first bc of the hype but there is no way it is a sustainable business... people will try it but they are not coming back for seconds... it will not last more than a year or two...their competitors in the area have way better food. Oh and if you want a great milkshake go to cookout...you can't beat their milkshakes they are amazing (and their burgers too).",

The house made lemonade is the perfect combo of tart and sweet. My 2 star review is because the Shake Shack app leaves MUCH to be desired. If you're not a fan of waiting in ridiculously long lines the app is a must. However, out of the 4 times I've tried to use it I've only successfully been able to order once. Every other time, after I've done all the steps of choosing a pickup time, choosing my items, and putting in my credit card info it errors out right at the end when I hit the submit order button. An error message pops up that says \"Ruh Roh! There was a problem processing your order. Please try again later!\" The Scooby Doo expression is super irritating after you've \"tried again later\" several times. Like I said I was only successful ordering ONCE out of 4 separate attempts on different days. That's a piss poor ratio.",

I got the ShackStack, with a portabella mushroom fried and stuffed with cheese on top of a cheeseburger. Mushroom was quite mealy, and threw off the taste of the entire burger. Got a root beer float, because they were out of coffee shakes. Float came in a huge cup that was almost all root beer...very little custard, disappointing to say the least. My girls (college age) loved the fries, and said their burgers were good, but we all agreed that you can get much better burgers at equal price point without the wait at a number of different Charlotte restaurants. Probably a one and done for me. Not worth the wait, IMO, when I can go to Bad Daddys or Liberty and get a great burger, and a cold beer of my choice (only one beer offered at SS), and be almost finished in the time it would take me to wait in line at Shake Shack. No thanks.",
