We all have to share the space and chain smokers significantly diminish the fresh air quality and appeal of the establishment.  I understand that it is outside, however the patio is a confined and dedicated space for ALL patrons. We should not have to be subjected to the decisions of the smokers.",

Quite a few Panthers fans were there (with not a lot of cheering going on...) but the food came out fast, and it was quite good for bar food...I had the chicken club with fries, and had a few of my friends onion rings - the decor was also great, very spacious, I might have to swing by here some evening when it's booming to see the crowd that hangs out here!  I'd definitely recommend Thomas Street Tavern if you are looking for a quick lunch and drink!",

    "text": "Compared to a lot of the places I've been in the QC, Thomas Street delivered almost exactly what I expected when I walked in the door for the first time.  The best two comparisons I can come up with is either a college type bar / pub or a drinking bar.  This is the type of place you can take that one friend who is a klutz when drinking and not worry .  From the looks of it the floor and walls and every thing else in the bar has had worse done to it than having a few drinks spilled.    Prices for drinks were fantastic!!  You will not be paying $6-$7 a beer here, even for micro brews.  Staff -  They honestly looked bored the night I was in.  I really couldn't blame them.  They looked like they are used to really moving and hustling when busy and they certainly weren't this night.  Compared to a lot of the crappy service I've had here in Charlotte this was above average.  Food - Standard and some glorified bar food, served in 50's style plastic baskets w/ wax paper.  If you forgot to eat before drinking or need something to soak up the excess alcohol afterward this will serve it's purpose.  If you're looking for a great meal, I'd look elsewhere.  There are Flat screens every where and plenty of other bar activities to keep you busy.  I'd definitely pay a visit again, I'd just eat first elsewhere.",

In fact, if you don't prefer a certain scene for a bar (i.e. hipster, dive bar, biker bar, etc), you'd like this place.  The clientele is mixed; black white, straight, gay, college age and cougar alike find a home here.    They have Stella Artois on tap and a couple of atypical beers on special.  The patio is awesome, even in the winter when they pull out heaters.  The tavern gets kinda packed in the summer months...so if you don't mind the crowd, you're in for a treat.",

You can spend time here on their patio out back, where dogs are welcome, enjoying warm weather and dining al fresca or even at night in chillier temps they have neato fire pits at several tables.

Before I left, the incompetent waitress charged my card not only what I owed for my drink, but she also included everyone else's bill.  YEP, that means I was charged over $200 for a $4 drink.  When I confronted the waitress to address her mistake, she rudely tole me to hold on because she was busy doing something else.  Then, when I showed her my bill she snatched it out of my hand as if it were my mistake and just walked off.  The manager had to get involved and tried to pacify me by asking what she could do to make me feel better.  She tried to console me by rubbing my arm (PLEASE don't touch me)  and then offered me a $25 gift card (like I'll EVER return to this joke of an establishment).  Here's the kicker: she said the money would be debited back to my card...IN FOUR DAYS and couldn't seem to understand why I was still mad.  I need my money back NOW ma'am.  I don't want to be pacified; I want your incompetent employee's mistake corrected.  This was my first and DEFINITELY LAST experience with this place.  NEVER, EVER AGAIN.",

There is a cute little cabanaesque bar outside on the patio, I would recommend going outside because it is much less congested.  Not only that, the guys who hang out around the pool table are kind of pushy and not really people friendly.  I did get a chance to meet the owner towards the nights end and he was very approachable, and seemed to care about his guests.

Decent beer selection, but nothing spectacular...like I said its the atmosphere of Thomas Street that makes it so cool, everyone is just there to chill, drink, meet up and have a good time.  The stadium seating near the ping-pong table adds to the unique attitude of this bar and when the competition heats up you can feel it throughput the lower part of the outdoor bar.  When the temperatures dip south they have fire pits in some of the outdoor tables as well as the traditional stand alone outdoor heaters. So come outside, drink a beer and gaze at the stars, and feel the vibe of Thomas Street; my favorite bar in Charlotte, it's unpretentious and straight -up chill so come kick it, if it isn't already ridiculously crowded...if it is... head up the street to P-Stone.",

The ambiance on this week night was a bit dull.  Its not that anything was WRONG, there was just something missing.  I soon remembered that every previous time I'd been to Thomas Street was during the spring or summer time.  I feel like the cold weather has a negative affect on TST.  This is probably because so much about this bar is predicated on its extensive outdoor patio set-up.   I must admit, I feel somewhat bad about this review because I have been here plenty of times on Summer nights and this place has been awesome in every way.  With that being said, its probably best to hibernate away from Thomas Street until the weather warms up a bit...",

    "text": "I have been going here for a solid 10 years. That makes me feel old. It also makes me feel like I am finally a real Charlottean to be able to say that.   The Good: This is a True neighborhood bar. This isn't hipster. It will never be hipster. Thomas St is simply T St. It never changes much- even with the neighborhood changing. You can easily go there and see people from all different walks of life, ethnicity, age and income.   The outdoor area really is the best in Charlotte. I dare you to find one that is more comfortable, welcoming, not pretentious and with a lot of plants (seriously Charlotte- so many outdoor areas here are not landscaped).  There are games galore and plenty of seating. Lots of heaters and fire pits.   This is one of the best spots in the city to watch TV outside. One of my favorite days was watching a game outside under the patio while there was a storm.  The Nachos can be really good (not always), the chicken fingers are highly recommended (especially the honey mustard), the king veggie burrito is a favorite with the vegetarians and the commonwealth roast beef is for the meat eaters.  You can bring your dog!!! (do not walk him through the restaurant- there is usually a gate open in the back. Ask someone to open it if it isn't)  They still have the same crappy Christmas decorations, there are always people willing to play pool (it is very communal- you don't own the table with your BFF- at Thomas St you share), the TV's are usually on mute because this isn't really sports bar. It is more like a neighborhood hang out.  The Bad: T St is not consistent. You might go there and have really good food. The next time you go- meh.   This used to be a fun place on a Saturday night. Now it is a during the week type of a place or during the day. The Friday and Saturday night crowd is really annoying. Think: part busses from University. It turns into a really awkward meat market. Avoid late night on weekend.  The service can be bad. We accept this about T St. In fact, I'm sort of happy that it hasn't changed. Don't get me wrong- there are some really good servers who have been there for years. But there is also a \"I don't care\" attitude that happens. Don't take it personally. It is part of Thomas Street's charm and irritation.   I personally love this place, but it isn't for everyone, nor should it be.",

They had good food and service. Outside was a slightly different experience.    I was first concerned when I noticed the waiter did not write anything down. It took 30 minutes to get the first appetizers. At that point I as about the chips and guacamole with no response from waiter. After 10 more minutes he was reminded once again. Another 10 goes by and everyone else was finishing. Still no chips. A friend went inside and asked the waiter again about my order. After another 5 minutes it finally arrived. Had to eat fast as everyone was ready to go. Only got to eat half due to time constraints. A good waiter would have comped the order. Not this one. So I think the problem I have is strictly with the waiter and not the restaurant. I will go back and give it another chance. Sometimes you just have to write it off as a bad experience.",

It is always nearly impossible for me to find a server to take my order, but once I do everything is fine.  Other than the slight frustration of needing a server in this place the drinks and food are good.  I'd say go here when it's not too busy, you'll enjoy it more.  Unless you like that packed in a can like a sardine kinda thing.",

Thursday night is the best night it's reggae night, they have a Dj outside in their back area which is definitely the highlight of the bar it's a huge open area with multiple fire pits ping pong tables corn hole and 2 additional bars from the one inside. All the bartenders are amazing but Aleisha is my favorite (hopefully I'm spelling her name right) she always takes care of my boyfriend and I and makes some damn good drinks. The drinks are super cheap compared to other bars in the city but the pours are generous. Any night is a good night to come here but the weekends are a little more busy than I like but they handle the volume amazingly. They also have a great menu and serve food until 2 am anything after 145 is made to go I think, and they have a vegetarian option too! Easy parking on the side of the building and on the streets.",

Would come here more often if the staff had a positive attitude and actually made us feel welcome. The bartenders are also inconsistent in their mixing.

There have been plenty of times where friends were running late for dinner so we would pop into the tavern for a quick drink before dinner.  Never actually eaten here, but I suspect the usual pub-ish food.  Bartenders are pretty nice and the place isn't so crazy that they actually have time to talk to you.  I haven't become \"a regular\" yet, but I can see this place having a lot of those types of clients.  I've been in their outdoor area maybe once or twice and it is filled with activities.  In all honesty, I pretty much stick to home base - the bar... and I am pretty content there.",

But it has a pool table and some fun games with a small bar in the corner. Where the real fun comes is when you step out back. They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months    Overall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte.",

I'd most likely pick one of Charlotte's premier breweries or even a passable taproom/pub over any bar/watering hole in town. Buuuuuut....throw in a couple of ping pong tables and I'm hooked. I'll hold a paddle and slam backhands all night long, regardless of where it is, with a grin from ear to ear. Heck, if there were a pingpong table at my wife's nail salon I'd go every time.   Thomas Street is a great dive-y bar to meet up with some friends for some sub-par grub and plenty of foamy brews. I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed a good greaser or hoagie. Hey Oh, heartburn! It's always worth it, though, isn't it?   Best part about this joint is the back patio. Not much to shake a stick at in the winter time or if the sun isn't shining on a Saturday afternoon, but when it's right, this place is the crown jewel of hangouts on Thomas Ave. Cornhole, plenty of bench seats, tables, draughts outside, and many a lively 20-something enjoying it all the same. Again, ping pong tables? Count me in. Note: it can be rather difficult to nudge your way in line to grab a game. Kindly ask bro-ho du jour for next game and you should be good.   Thomas Street Tavern is an easy go-to if you're in the Plaza area. A mix of entertainment and space make easy for a revisit.",

It's a really chill atmosphere, more like you're hanging in your friends backyard. We brought our three small dogs and had a great time. The wait was pretty long, but there was only one waitress serving the back patio and literally every table was full, so it's not really her fault. We will definitely be back soon!",

T he game we were looking for wasn't on but he was nice enough to put it on one of the many TVs.   I ordered the california club which was delicious!  And had a few irresistible $2 PBRs. But the winning quality for me was that they keep the juke box going even when the games are on, which I love, but it could have been pumped up a decibel or few.  They have chalkboard walls in the restrooms but  BYOC (bring your own chalk)  jukebox and pool table near the front.  Awesome back patio with baggo boards, table tennis, and wall hooky.  As well as a fire pit, TVs, two bars and plenty of seating.  fyi - order wings or ribs on sunday and get entered to win a trip to vegas.  We won the package trip and it's not without a catch.... the airfare is 2 for 1 at regular price and the hotel package is sunday - thursday, the $500 in vegas chips is a coupon book to vegas.... so, while it's still super cool to win anything especially an excuse to go to vegas, it's not exactly a free trip to vegas.",

Lots of beers and cigarettes out there though. Also, maybe I should've known this, but this is a drink spot not a food spot. Like they only had 1 guy as a waiter for the entire place, inside and outside. The square footage of this place is actually a lot, like maybe 5000? (Total guess.) That's too much ground for one guy if you're at all hungry and going for food. In any case, maybe I did it wrong, but I don't see myself ever going here again. Food was kind of basic. Kind of like the quality you would see at a run down Applebee's, and maybe the same clientele that thinks that's a good date spot. Not saying that's a bad thing, just what you get here. Cheers.",

The setup of the entire place is perfect. The back patio can be quite a party, so sometimes chillin on the front patio can be nice/relaxing. Depending on your mood. Take care of the staff & they definitely take care of you. Hefty pours on the drinks for a great price. One of my favorite things about T St is the jukebox. I'm not a fan of the expensive internet jukebox with any kind of music on it. Theres a great variety of music in the jukebox. The back patio is great for all seasons. I'm a smoker, so sometimes on the weekend when I get out of my other job ill hangout all the way in the back at the tiki bar. I can smoke freely there, and it's usually less crowded on a weekend night. It's a cash bar, so be sure to have cash. The weekends get pretty busy. There's always entertainment with the crowd there, never a dull moment. So many different walks of life come in/out of there. Everyone is welcome. Love the diversity.  This place is a fantastic neighborhood watering hole. One of my favorite places in charlotte for sure!",

There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this place. Walk in and you get that old bar feel, with friendly bartenders to greet you on the right and a pool table on your left. Be sure to order an extremely affordable beer ($4.50 draught everyday!) for yourself. The taps rotate, but yesterday included the Triple-C IPA, Highland Gaelic Ale, Guiness Stout, Noda Midnight Madness, and more.   After you choose a delicious craft brew, keep walking out back and you'll find another bar entirely, TWO Ping Pong tables, and a Cornhole set ready to rock. I spent the better part of last night holding down a table, which is exactly the confidence boost a struggling doctorate student needs every once in a while.   All in all, terrific bar and I find myself coming back at least once whenever I visit home. I've never tried the food, though it always smells like fried heaven. Stay exactly the same, Thomas St Tavern!",

(Sometimes a drink) I really like they have two bars. One inside and in the warm months an outside bar. They also have table tennis and plenty of outside seating.   My favorite thing to eat is the french dip and pasta salad. The cuben aint so bad either. The nachos are darn good also. You really cannot go wrong with food here. All in all, a good place to hang out, get some drinks and bite to eat.",

Such a local feel, with neighborhood kids of all ages (drinking age of course) and their dogs! Everyone is super friendly and there is normally a corn hole or ping pong game to jump in on. And that fun game with the sting and hook - what is that game??? I don't know but its hours of fun and conveniently located next to one of Thomas Streets two bars in the back area.   You gotta love a bar that takes their live music seriously too - its always good. Its also a pretty rad lace for Sunday football. There aren't enough TVs to watch every game at once outside from one seat but I can't lie to you ... its kind of nice. It causes more banter and chat with soon to be close friends and lets be real - this whole NFL ticket thing is great but slow down! Remember our parents didn't have this luxury. Plus that ESPN app is pretty killer. BUT if you must see all 5 to 7 games from your seat go inside. That big ass screen and all the TVs lining the walls will suit your fancy just fine.",

The staff is really good, and even when it's jam-packed you won't have to wait too long to get a beer. The downside to Thomas Street (and it's a HUGE one) is that it's usually packed full of young frat boy, wannabe hipster bankers. Like, people who aren't hip enough for Snug Harbor, but are too cool for the clubs Uptown. If you can get a big enough crowd to \"insulate\" yourself from these morons, it's a good time. Otherwise, be prepared to be surrounded by d-bags.",

The servers take the time to joke around and chat.   My favorite thing about TST is that they remain up to date without having to cheapen the heart of the place.

I met her there and the place was typical of a bar/pub.  The back patio looked nice and large, which is where I've heard it's really chill to drink out back during the summer, but as this was a cooler day in Charlotte (high 30's), this was not so appealing.  The staff was helpful and friendly and pretty attentive, so this was clearly not what caused me to give them 2 stars.  It was the food.  I had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a BLT w/ fries.  It's not that it wasn't cooked properly or wasn't decent, it's just that it wasn't anything special and when it comes to bar/pub food in Charlotte, there certainly are other places that are much, much better.  All in all, it felt more like a bar/pub restaurant chain more than a neighborhood hangout and I was certainly expecting more.  Like I said, it might be a cool bar to hang out during the summer, but not a restaurant that should necessarily be sought after.  I'll probably give it another chance if someone wanted to go there, but won't be convincing my friends to go have a meal there.",

I'm not sure what it would be like full - we went on a Tuesday night - but it looks like it could be fun.   My friends and I all ordered Blue Moon beer. The newly pregnant one ordered a Shirley Temple and got a hint of an eye roll from the server. Even so, we loved our server - he was attentive and friendly, checking back often to see if we were doing alright.   It was cold that night, so I couldn't talk the group into going outside to enjoy the fire on the patio. However, if and when I go back, I will certainly check it out. I love the stadium seating out there.    think the layout of this place was the most impressive to me. They have a front patio where dogs can hang out too, then you walk into a long bar where I'm sure the regulars sit, then a seating area on the ground level leads to the back where more tables are available on a raised platform. Couple this with the back patio and its ping pong action, and you've got yourself a really friendly neighborhood bar worth coming home to.",

I don't like the crowd, and the service gets pretty (understandably) sloppy when it's busy. The whole scene reminds me of college a little too much...screaming folks enamored with their own drunkenness...If you're in the mood for college antics, it's a great place to go.  On the other hand, I've had great experiences at Thomas Street during the afternoons. It's good for lunches with friends, especially in the summer with the patio. On evenings when it's not too crowded, the drama at the ping pong table can be pretty intense. (Has anyone else noticed that Charlotte has a weirdly elaborate ping pong culture?)  I like Thomas Street's food, which is solid as far as standard American bar food goes. I'm getting a little old and crochety about big crowds, but overall, it's a safe bet for a good place to go out for night life or for a good dinner.",

Anyway, this bar is pretty great, as is the area it's in, from the looks of it.  When we first walked in, J headed to the bar to get us some Garlic Ale. I scanned the place: pretty people, but few of them. He handed me a beer and said, \"Here. Follow me.\" We wandered back toward the bathrooms and out into a huge crowd on one of the best bar patios I've ever seen. There's ping pong, there's cornhole, there's another bar. The tables are huge and round, perfect for sitting back and people-watching, which is what we did for the first beer. Then, we moved out to the front patio, which also has tables, to sit and write our creative little ideas on napkins and shuffle cards and sip beer and tell secrets. It was a great place for a Saturday night, and I'll definitely be back to the neighborhood whenever I'm in Charlotte.",

We stepped off the porch and down to the patio by the ping pong tables, and there was an unlit torch, so I decided to go light it from the one on the patio myself.  As I was about to light it, someone grabbed the stand, and I wheeled around to see one of the staff with an angry face ask me \"What are you doing? The fire marshal told us yesterday that we couldn't have these, and now you're dripping oil all over the patio.\"  Now I understand that this guy probably has to deal with lots of drunken crazies with pyro fetishes (after all there's a table at the outside bar that has a fire pit in it), and he needs to be firm to get his point across, but I did not at all appreciate that tone when there were clearly other tiki torches lit around the porch, and there was not a drop of oil on the ground under the torch that I was holding.  Ok, whatever, \"I'm so sorry, I'll just sit down\".  Three minutes pass, and the same guy walks out to light the said tiki torch.  He then pats my arm and says \"There you go, honey, your torch is now lit.\"  Please don't touch me, particularly if you don't know me, and you were just reprimanding me with angry eyes.  I know you're trying to make nice, but the touching only makes it creepy.  5 minutes later, a different guy on the patio who was smoking and talking on his cell phone closes his phone forcefully while uttering a choice expletive and walks up to the tiki torch, blowing it out with wet, smoky breath.  He then proceeds to walk up to the porch and blow them all out, and recruit the original employee from my story, and they carry all the now blown-out tiki torches back to the shed where no one can mess with them.  Guess the fire marshal did call.  Whatever, I understand, just wish they'd had their story straight.  So now I'm watching ping pong, and helping retrieve the balls that fall under the net (why bother to have a net if it doesn't go all the way to the ground to catch the balls), and all of a sudden the first employee comes running out with angry eyes to yell at the girl who put her bottle on the table.  Again understandable, but she was not being drunk or belligerent, and it was the first time, for like 2 seconds.  Clearly this guy has had to deal with one too many people and just doesn't care about being hospitable any more.  All that said, I did like this place.  There could have been more heaters out back, but the ping pong, cornhole, and fire pit by bar were awesome.  I would go back.  As long as I wear heavier clothes for the cold weather, and make sure to be on my best behavior.",

    "text": "Thomas Street Tavern on Thomas Avenue, lol.  I'm not sure whether to give this place 5 stars or 3, so I guess 4 will work.  It has a lot of potential.  One of the few places that has had bar games for quite some time.  They have a full bar and plenty of good beers.  A very nice back deck to boot.  Parking is deplorable and I just don't always get along with the crowd, though.  I've walked right through the front patio but have never actually sat there.  I should, would be great people watching.  Once you walk through that area you enter through the doors and into the main bar area.  There is a bar on the right, pool and foosball on the left, and seat yourself dining in the back.  They are normally pretty quick with the food service if thats what your looking for.  If you walk past all that you get to the ping pong tables, cornhole, and other bar area.  That's where you'll normally find me.  The food is pretty good, but its always been a side note for me.  A little better than average bar food.  The chicken nachos are pretty good.  The sandwiches are solid as well.  I'm not that big of a fan of the spinach and artichoke dip.  It is really rich and the toast points aren't really that great.  All in all, its a great place and I see why people go there.  The crowd just isn't always my kind of crowd.  But that could just be me.",

His response was that they do have steak.....a steak sandwich that we could take the bread off and make it a steak. Seriously??  Our server was super slow. Waited 20 minutes for anyone to come to our table. By the time I was tired of waiting for her and headed to the bar to get my own drinks she finally showed up at our table. Did not take all of our drink orders before she left. Hardly returned to our table for follow up and then when she did we had to ask the same thing more than once. We will not be coming back and will be advising our friends not to come here. Customer service is not a priority.",

    "text": "Add Thomas Street Tavern to the long list of places I've been to numerous times in Charlotte and have still yet to review. But I chock that up to being a few beers deep once I manage to walk out of here.  For a bar in the Plaza Midwood area it's like a household name. Somebody in a group at Common Market without fail will eventually say \"Ya wanna just head over to Thomas Street?\" and you're bound to be there. Another neat point is that this place attracts all types and all ages. I have quite my share of stories...what's with me? I can remember the events but never bring myself up to write a review until now?? Alas, it's been many years since my visit here on one crazy bar crawl night.  The tap isn't huge, so making your decision is quick and easy. It is bigger than your standard sports bar but Thomas Street still manages to maintain that sports bar vibe IMO. So if you're against that, it might not be your place. But, if you can put that aside, there's lots of benefits from being here. Notably: ping pong tables. I love me some ping pong. And what's better than ping pong and beer? I like trying to smash points across the net while waiting for the inebriation to set in. That is, if you can get on a table. You basically just have to step up and say \"me next!\" Inevitably there's always some nerdy dude champing every would-be challenger on one of the two tables. So, prepare to wait. When the weather is nice they will also have a few cornhole boards out. Nothing beats that for a southern night of drinking.  All in all, they have plenty of drink choices to keep me interested. Standard local bar prices - if I remember correctly... Plenty of seating unless it's just a packed evening with some sort of sporting event going on. If you're setting up a bar-hop in the area, this place should be on the list. (No, you may not use the ping pong tables for beer pong.)",

If you are not a local or don't know one, you probably wouldn't know about this place since it is out of the tourist area.  Food experience wise.. Saturday evening gets crowded and busy with a small selection of craft beer.  Ordered some chicken tenders tossed in buffalo with a side order of cheese tots!  The chicken tenders were definitely something I was looking for.. They give you a generous portion and do not over bread the chicken before they fry it.  The chicken was tender with every bite.  The cheese totz were good on Saturday night because they were crispy with enough sharp cheddar cheese.  Sunday afternoon the chicken tenders were just as satisfying as Saturday but the cheese totz were soggy and soft.. There was no crunch to it.. And the serving experience on Sunday was terrible.. I had to go find my waitress to order and find her to pay for my bill... Saturday night this gentleman provided my party and I with amazing service and was prompt.  OK... Now what makes this bar so different.. In the back patio there are two tables of ping pong for guests to play, two \"sink and hook\" games, and 2 sets of corn hole games! Saturday night gets really busy so its hard to play corn hole or ping pong and on Sunday there was only one corn hole game out since there wasn't a high amount of requests for it.  Overall, very chill and relaxing bar. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to drink and play games with friends...",

I decided to give her a tip after I was finished drinking instead of right away, so i gave her a $20 and took my change. If I tipped her right away tonight, she would've gotten $2 for this one order. Instead of doing that, i wanted to give her a full $20 when finished drinking. As I am sitting in the bar right now, I have finished drinking but am not tipping. Here's why: she looked at me and said \"I work for tips and am pregnant\" in a rude tone. I said \"i know you do, i am tipping you before I leave.\" She looked at me, rolled her eyes and said \"yeah you will.\" Well no, I'm not tipping you anymore. I didn't give you this job, a baby, or the attitude you have. The place is dope, fuck the service",

This is a staple in the community. A great meet up place to start the evening or to just stay and hang out.   Food is good, you'll never be there for long without meeting a new friend. The 1st bar at the entrance is small. With a few booths behind it. A pool table to the left, with more table tops and booths. It really reminds me of a shotgun house. Once you make it to the back and out the back exit/entrance it really opens up.   Outside you'll find a fire pit, long benches a few tables. To your left you'll find a more spacious (term used lightly) bar with a couple booths as well. Ping Pong/Table Tennis, modern day Horse Shoe game. I forgot what the kids call it now days. I really like the back patio its really nice.  Only draw back that i could think of is the dumpster that's back there. Summer time IT STINKS and that's all i have to say about that!!  Go Enjoy,  TTFN",

The table behind us griped about  the service and their meals were all paid for by the restaurant.  We didn't complain, but were sure turned off by the slow service.  I thought the food was average.  I had a turkey burger with tater tots.  It was good, but.nothing to write home about.  I realize this is more of a pub and if I dropped in for a beer, I would have had a different experience.   As it was, it was just okay.   The service skewed my view of the restaurant.  Too bad.   I know it's somewhat of a local treasure in the Plaza Midwood area.",

    "text": "I love Thomas Street Tavern! I've been there several times and have always had great service.  I will say that parking can be difficult but that goes for any place located in the Plaza-Midwood area. It can get very crowded on the weekends but I still manage to get good service.  They have pool tables inside and frequently they have live music. On the nights they have live music they charge a small cover charge.  JT is an awesome bartender.  He always takes good care of me.  They have a bar inside and out back. There are lots of games out on the back patio that can get crowded on the weekend.  All of the food that I've had here is fantastic. My personal favorite is to snack on the cheese fries.  It's definitely a great place to check out in the Plaza-Midwood area and probably my favorite.",

    "text": "I'm a disabled veteran with a small service animal.  At 9pm on May 6, 2018 a completely inebriated off-work bar manager named Josh got loud and belligerent and shoved me on the back patio.  He took issue with the fact I had a service dog with me, despite the fact that she was properly identified as such to the doorman and I was simply carrying her out back to meet some friends because no one was available to let us in through the side entrance.  The truth of the matter is, the only reason Josh wasn't neutralized at that very moment, IS BECAUSE I HAD THE VERY SERVICE ANIMAL WITH ME HE TOOK ISSUE WITH.  My group of friends and I of course left, costing the bar at least $200 that night alone.  Good job Josh!  I wonder how Scotty'd feel about that?  Take-away;  Thomas Street Tavern fails to adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it pertains to service animals and how to respectfully deal with patrons with them.  They also have a douchebag manager that runs off longtime regulars and may just assault you.",

Beer selection was meh so I went with a margarita. It was sickly sweet -- if I hadn't watched the bar tender pour in tequila, I would have sworn it didn't have any alcohol at all.   After said drinks, I was ready for a visit to the little girls' room. Line for bathrooms stretched almost to the front door. One of the ladies in line with me said it was taking so long because girls were \"doing blow\" in there. If that doesn't capture what a classy place this is, I don't know what else will. Oh, wait! Maybe this'll help convince you... While there, we watched a man being carried out in a head lock by 3 bouncers. He was bleeding from no less than 5 different spots. Once booted to the sidewalk, he stood around literally gushing blood onto the street while the cops that seem to be permanently stationed out front tried to clean him up.   Never again, folks. Never again.",

Our waiter was so hot and friendly. In the back, We had a couple good convos with our fellow smokers. Heard the have reggae night on Thursdays I will definitely be checking that out!

The bartenders are attentive and friendly.  And for an added bonus they have a pretty good Scotch selection.    Thomas Street Tavern reminds me of gringo bars in Mexico that are a little bit out of the way but if you ask the right people or poke around enough, you'll inevitably wind up here.  Slightly eclectic crowd, cabin fever locals, musicians who are off the clock, road worn travelers.  And everyone there just wants to get away from the fray, not too loud, be casual, mingle and leave everything else behind...  The juke box could use some more choices, but all in all a decent Friday night bar where you could spend a good long time decompressing.  Don't dress up and don't eat here.",

From the ping pong tables where my friend said he could totally pwn all the people there to the corn hole and various other games it was all super chill.  The drinks here can get a bit expensive though. My friend had 2 margaritas and the tab came out to $25!! What?! I am kind of used to $6-10 margaritas. I went with the eternally girly Malibu bay breeze and it was fairly decent on pricing.  This place is a cool place for chilling with your bros and girlfriends but I think I'd recommend pregaming at home or Common Market down the street before heading here and hitting up the games and keeping your drink orders to a minimum.",

That's right PING PONG!! I'm a sucker for a good game of table tennis :)  I actually prefer the space outside because of the room and space it affords you so I can't wait till the weather breaks and temperatures drop so I can really enjoy it.  Back to the food.  I have a couple favorites, one being the Chicken Tweety (I think it's called Jessica's Tweety now).  Grilled chicken breast with lettuce and tomato on a toasted hoagie roll with garlic salt butter atop the bread that really makes the sandwich great.  My other favorite is the Johnny Dollar Beach Burger.  Huge burger topped with whatever you like and sure to fill you up, no worries!  They also have an option to build your own sandwich which is great if you are looking to make a veggie sandwich with lots of fresh ingredients.  The decor is full of warm wood and brick accents, I think it actually use to be an old post office? Great location out front with a simple patio space that equates to a good people watching location (my favorite spectator sport).",

I've been going to Thomas Street for about 2 years now and it has one of the most ecclectic and diverse crowds I've seen in Charlotte.  During the week, you will find a less crowded more chill scene, and on the weekend it is usually packed after 10:30 (but not in a way that makes it annoying).  The outside patio has cornhole, and ping pong tables -  inside there is pool and foozball.    The bartenders are very down to earth.  The drink prices are the best I've seen in Charlotte, and they are poured generously.    This is NOT a club scene, top 40 kind of place.  You will find a juke box with mostly alternative and classics.  Come dressed down, and be prepared to get comfortable and have a great time.  Oh, and if you are leaving the bar solo at night, a bartender or bouncer is always happy to walk you to your car (in fact, they insist!).  There really isn't a bad thing I could say about Thomas Street.  It gets 5 stars because they also allow dogs on the patio :)  *Please note, I reviewed Thomas Street Tavern as a bar, not a restaurant.",

The menu is as random as the clientele, but mostly consists of sandwiches.  I had the chili nachos, cheese fries, and BLT with fries (take your judgment elsewhere, it was my cheat meal).  It was all really delicious in the greasy bar food kind of way.  And it was all really cheap.  That being said, the service was kind of shitty.  There was one waitress for the entire patio and she was just so over it... or possibly on drugs.  Like I said before, the clientele is interesting, which is both a good and bad thing.  Sometimes interesting means funny and cool; sometimes interesting means super hillbilly and creepy.  I find that you can generally avoid the latter type of interesting by staying in the patio/fire pit area, as they tend to congregate around the pool tables and outside bar.  Also great for nights when you just don't feel like wearing big girl/boy pants.  Nobody here will think less of you for wearing sweatpants and flip flops.",

    "text": "Thomas Street Tavern seems to be a great Plaza-Midwood place for locals to gather. It has the typical bar/tavern feel - large oak bar, booths and tables all made of dark wood, plenty of TVs, and neon beer signs in abundance. Inside is fairly spacious and outside there is a large patio with ping pong and corn hole. The crowd is generally pretty mixed, younger and older.  They have a decent beer selection and daily specials, and the food is pretty good, too. They do sandwiches, burgers, wings, and appetizers. Everything is fresh (food and beer), and service is consistent.  Thomas Street Tavern is my go-to in the area for something laid back on a night out and is a great spot to round out the evening.",

This is a great place to meet and hang out after a long week or a hard day at work.",

Thomas Street Tavern is one of the hubs of our neighborhood.  They make wonderful, fresh salads with plenty of dressing on the side.  Last time that I was there, my friend and I ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  So good.  Served with the right amount warm pita bread.  I have never been disappointed with their food.  The interior is just right for a neighborhood pub, and it features front door and back door outside spaces.  We have such good memories from years of hanging out at our neighborhood club house and can't imagine a better experience in a fancy-dancy exclusive community spot.",

    "text": "Thomas Street Taven was one of the first bars I ever went to charlotte. It isuch an awesome place. After spending more time in Plaza Midwood, I started to experience this bar on different nights.    The atmosphere here is amazing. You have a bar inside with tv's, a foosball table, and a pool table.  During the week it begins to feel like cheers where the bartenders remember your name and your drink.  The bartenders actually are pretty cool down to earth people here. The outside section is where this bar shines.  There is plenty of seating with fire pits and another bar outside. They have a net enclosed ping pong area which is always fun trashed, cornhole, and the akward game where you have to get the ring on the hook. This mix of people here is great.  From locals, to hipsters, to college kids, and anyone else in between.    For me if you don't want to go to a club Thomas Street is always an amazing place to go.  There is so much fun things to do outside and the people watching is great.  The bar prices are not expensive at all and there are many other bars to hop to close by.  The food here is acceptable, but I would probably eat somewhere else if I could.  Though the atomsphere is what makes this place shine.",

Sometimes they have a DJ or live music outside on busier nights. The staff is really hip and cool and it's a great place to hang out with friends and run into other peeps you know as well.   I've only eaten here a couple times at lunch and the food is pretty good but I personally enjoy just hanging here for drinks. There are also other bars within walking distance so it's a great place to start a fun weekend night or get some sun on a Sunday Funday!  Special tip: There are 3 restrooms inside the restaurant and 2 of them are typically designated for the ladies so the lines are always really quick for females, which is awesome! Also, the potty rooms have huge chalkboards on the wall so patrons have fun doodling notes to their friends and other random peeps who use the facilities. Totally random but FUN! Like the ladies need MORE things to do while in the restroom. ;)",

Thomas Street Tavern offers  your standard pub-grade food: it will fill your tummy, stall or soak up the alcohol and get the job done.    What I enjoy about Thomas Street is that it's unpretentious: what you see is what you get.  Pool table, back patio, plenty of seating, decently priced beers and adequate service.  TVs that are just perfect for moving your eyes towards when your conversation lulls or when that hot guy you've been checking out catches you staring at him (just pretend you're looking past him, right? Hehe.)  Verdict: not a bad neighborhood pub, if your expectations are for a neighborhood pub.",
