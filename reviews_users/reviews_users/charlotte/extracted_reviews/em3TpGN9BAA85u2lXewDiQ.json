I came for lunch with my seven year old son and we shared a lunch portion of tofu with mixed vegetables.  Here are my impressions:  PROS  *Beautiful decor *Attentive service *Spotlessly clean *Very good fried rice and tofu with mixed vegetables  CONS  *Weak tea (there's just no excuse...tea bags are cheap!) *Garden salad was just iceberg with a couple cucumbers and shredded carrots. Some romaine or mesclun would be so much healthier and tastier! Also the dressing came in a solo container with lid, tacky and not eco-friendly.  *No curry on the menu...I LOVE curry!!  Jo Jo China Bistro in Ballantyne was my favorite, and our family was devastated when it closed. Ming Fu could potentially be our new favorite with a few small changes.",

Three of us had lunch there a while back. First impression decor is dramatic, and service was prompt but that's the end of the good news.   As for the sushi the only fish they have is salmon and tuna or yellowtail, typical for Charlotte really. Honestly due to the lack of variety I've given up on Sushi restaurants these days. Instead I buy quality sushi grade yellowtail and Scottish salmon by the pound -the fish store up the street - we have everything we need, wasabi, soya, sesame etc to pig out on sashimi at home. :)  For lunch we ordered Gyoza and 3 items from the Chinese menu, one of them was a shrimp dish, the other two I can't remember because the cooking was generic and there was nothing memorable about it ...other than it was bland. Well at least it wasn't bad.  Nice place, average food. Matthews is a foodies hell.",

Just about any roll you could want as well as all your standard Dishes, including kabobs for the kids. Drinks are inexpensive, and they have 4 or 5 varieties of Asian beer. No craft beer.

It was unmistakable, I had several pieces of rubbery pork that was cold on one side and scaldingly hot on the other.   The service is barely passable. The staff is nice and polite but just seem to have no interest in doing a good job. For example we asked our waitress for some plates for our kids. After telling us \"ok\" she went and played on her phone at a table in the back.  On a side note they only have 2 high chairs in a restaurant that seats probably 80. If we go when there are more than 10 other people dining we pretty much are guaranteed not to get a booster or high chair.  Which is a shame because the teriyaki kids meals with steamed broccoli are great!",

Simple, easy enough, nothing short of familiar if you're a sushi savant, etc. Came for lunch with a friend recently and had a great experience.   High notes: Crunchy noodles before your meal. I'm a large proponent of fried noodles and Ming Fu does em right.   Utterly comfy seating. The booths are greatly comfortable and welcome your rear rather nicely.   Sashimi lunch platter is a killer deal. I think around $12 for 6 pieces of sashimi and a cali roll. Yellowtail, salmon, and tuna.   Only negative is that it's not closer to Uptown. A solid spot for lunch, and I'm sure for dinner as well, and I'm looking forward to coming back when in the area.   I'll miss you until I see you next time, Ming Fu.",

They've all been at least good if not delicious. The sesame chicken has a nice fried crust but has a nice ratio of fried to chicken. The chicken and broccoli is tasty but could use a brown sauce or something to bump it up a notch. The broccoli is very fresh, even if you just get it as a side. The rice (white, brown, fried) is never stale or heavy.   We've done both dine in and take out and haven't noticed a big difference, which is awesome.  Every staffer I've interacted with, whether in person or over the phone, has been very pleasant.  The dining room isn't too large but can sit large parties fairly easily.   If you are coming from Trade, you don't have to get onto John to turn left into Ming Fu. Instead, turn in behind the Exxon. There is driving access that goes behind the restaurant.",

I ate here once before and it was fine too but fine isn't a good enough reason to risk food poisoning. I don't think I can ever go back. Felt compelled to share.",

First time got a noodle bowl which was very good and a nice value (probably what they do best honestly)  The crab rangoon was a great appetizer and way better than any buffet version I've had.    The second visit however, I wanted to try something different so I got the orange beef... which was disgusting.  The beef was overcooked and not tender.  The sauce was overly syrupy and way too sweet with NO taste of orange apart from the hard little candied orange peel curlies swimming in the sauce at the bottom of the plate.  There were four cold broccoli florets included but they had not been tossed with the stir fry....thus were cold and tasteless.  I'm no chef and I'm not from China but I can tell you they missed the boat on this one (no pun intended).  I plan on continuing to go here, I will try the sushi next time.",

The veggie roll was super greasy and instead of sauteed broccoli with tofu, I received mixed vegetables with tofu. However, the tofu was flavorful and the veggies well prepared.   We'll stop in again, and I'll take extra care in ordering to avoid any future mix-ups.",

    "text": "Service - good, but could improve knowledge and selling skills during ordering; Food - some are tasty, some are bland; Decor - nice; Management - non existent.  I was looking forward to trying Ming Fu in Matthews (they also have a location in Waxhaw, so having 2 restaurants must mean they are doing something right).  Immediately walking in you are greeted with smiles.  But it seems that patrons usually walk past the hostess desk and head for the area where there is a cashier.  It was the first area that you see walking in, but another woman had to walk over to the hostess desk to grab the menus.  Seems a little inefficient or confusing.  That's when I noticed the sushi bar.  The sushi bar looked inviting and I probably would have enjoyed sitting there for a meal but we had our 7 year old with us.  Next time, if it is just me and my husband we will probably sit at the sushi bar.  The decor is really nice (not too much, not too little). My husband did point out that the paper lamps looked as if someone smeared poo on them.  I thought he was crazy but when I looked up I could not agree more.  My daughter and I were grossed out but it was a good laugh.  Trying to forget the poo smeared paper lamps, I went back to the study the menu.  I asked the waitress for suggestions on a few things to try but both times she said she hadn't tried them yet (I asked for a suggestion between bbq ribs vs. boneless ribs; and to offer suggestions on spicy sushi - she has only tried one out of the entire menu, and the one she tried was not spicy).    We ended up ordering the following:  -egg rolls - very good, everything an egg roll should be -bbq ribs - a little dry, nothing to write home about. the marinade and sauce does not taste homemade.  It is very much like the packaged dry rub you can find at Asian groceries -wonton soup - the dumplings are nice and plump. The broth was salty but otherwise tasteless.  It could use flavor and maybe some more green onions. -pork fried rice - decent and average.  It was not bad but not special. -volcano roll - we ordered this because it sounded similar to the volcano roll we order at one of our favorite sushi restaurants back home (Chicago).  This roll was terrible and tasteless at Ming Fu. -crunch roll - this roll was very similar tasting to the volcano roll so it was also terrible and tasteless. -roll w/soft shell crab but I can't remember the name - tasteless, just ok. -sesame beef with brown rice (I ordered this to go since I did not enjoy the sushi and did not eat very much while I was seated and it was the first item on the Chefs Specialty list. I had a few bites of this when I got home) - it was pretty good and kept my hopes up that I might actually enjoy the entrees more than the sushi.  Overall, the service food was okay.  I want to come back in a few weeks to see if the food improves.  I will definitely be back a couple more times to give the specialty sushi and a few other entrees a try.  I want to give this place 4 stars, but I am just not a fan.  Seeing how the food tasted, I don't think it is deserving of 4 stars.  A few things about the staff - if I was the owner I would make sure that my staff could offer suggestions instead of say \"I haven't tried anything\".  Here is a suggestion - have your staff try the food before you have them on the floor.  How can you expect your staff to \"sell\" your food, if they don't believe in it and if they haven't tried it?  It's a great way to up-sell and make sure patrons feel confident about their orders.  Also, I did not see management on the floor at all.  Not one person came to ask us how the food or service was.  I would think that at a new restaurant, management would want to hear from customers and try to get repeat business.  Sushi - if you can't \"create\" specialty maki, don't do it.  I go out for maki because I don't make it at home.  I can easily get fresh fish from the market and make sushi - nigiri, but I enjoy going out for specialty rolls just to see and taste what others create.  If you don't have flavor or presentation, then it's not worth it to me to pay what you charge for a little piece of fish (or worse - imitation crab) from your menu.",

    "text": "We are fairly new to the Charlotte area, and this is the third Chinese place we have tried in Matthews (Best Wok and can't remember the name of the other one by Once Upon a Child).  So far, Ming Fu is our favorite. We have dined in once and order take out for lunch once.  Our dine in experience was excellent. Great service, fresh and tasty food. The decor is nice  and modern compared to most other Chinese restaurants in Matthews. My wife and son ordered sushi while my daughter and I split an order of pork lo-mein and orange beef, and pork dumplings for an appetizer. All of our food was pretty good, except the orange beef was a bit on the bland side. My wife said that Ming Fu has restored her taste for sushi. She said the last time she had sushi this good was when we lived in Nashville and she would go to Ken's.  Our take out experience was excellent as well. Sweet and sour pork was very good. The batter was crunchy and not thick, and the pork inside was fairly tender and not chewy like so many other Chinese take out joints. My wife had the cashew chicken and said it was very good, and we split some more lo-mein. The lunch portions are a decent size too and the cost is right on.  For any one who is nervous about trying a new place, I suggest try the take out first (be sure to eat it asap), and then if you are happy, dine in. The atmosphere is great inside and the servers are extra nice!",

    "text": "I did enjoy the food I have ordered for pick up several times, my critique addresses the horrendous service I received while dining in.  On a Monday night where the guest were minimal, a friend and I arrived at the planned time of 5:45 p..m.  We were immediately seated at a table for four next to a table for eight which had been recently utilized per evidence of the remaining dirty serve ware and place settings that indicated a feast had been recently enjoyed.  The hostess who seated us seemed to be at a loss for a smile or welcoming greeting.  We viewed the menu and when our server arrived ten minutes later, we placed our order.  Neither of the two staff members seemed to notice the pile of dirty dishes glaring at their current guest.  Our orders began arriving ten minutes later, and considering we were having the Triple Delight soup and  sharing a Pu Pu Platter, we were pleased with that part of our service.  While our server was adequate, she seemed to lack any type of personalty and just  \"did her job\" which added nothing to the experience, but felt awkwardly disturbing.   Once our complete orders had been received I wondered why each time something had been brought to our table, some of the dirty dishes from the adjacent table could not have been removed.  I found the experience disgusting and extremely distracting from the ambiance the restaurant seemed to be going for with the very nice decor.  As my dining companion was asked if she were finished and indicated that she was, her dishes were removed from in front of her along with sauces I was using to compliment the items on the Pu Pu Platter, I indicated that I was not finished and the waitress actually attempted to remove the condiment dish from my companion's dirty soup bowl and place it back on the table.  Once I indicated that her actions were unacceptable the waitress said she would return with \"another\" bowl.  When she returned with the \"new\" condiment she readily removed the remaining items I planned to eat from the platter.  Okay then, I guess I'm done.  The adjacent table was still filthy when we left and when I mentioned that I was unacceptable to this waitress, she indicated that it was not \"her\" table.  I replied, \"we were\" to which she offered a sheepish \"I'm sorry\".  So if that's what passes for adequate or good service, I'm good, THANKS!",

The seaweed was difficult to chew and I actually ended up spitting it out a couple of times and soup and/or salad is an extra cost not included with your sushi. I went during lunch time and they did not have any lunch specials. The ginger salad was large pieces of iceberg lettuce with a dressing on the side. Something you could probably make at home.  They give you free wonton chips with sweet-and-sour sauce while you wait.",

Everything we've tried has been simply delish! The food comes out quickly, ingredients are fresh and tasty. The ambiance is great, the prices are very reasonable and service is excellent! What else can I say but check it out for yourself!  Next time I go I want to try one of their Chef's Specials - I've seen some of the other tables get really interesting dishes!  P.S. Their house wines are only $4.25 a glass! Score!",

    "text": "My partner was in the mood for Chinese food last night, so I was a little skeptical as I considered the options:  fast food Chinese takeout?  No.  A Chinese buffet?  No.  Chain restaurant PF Chang's?  No.  An 1980s-decorated Chinese sit-down restaurant?  Definitely, no.   That's when he remembered seeing a new place being built in Matthews.  We drove by Ming Fu to see if it was open yet.  We had been at this establishment before just a couple of years ago when it was a burger place.  It was very nicely decorated inside before, but walking into Ming Fu now, you wouldn't even recognize it from before.  They've totally redone the inside and gave it a very modern, calming Zen-like feel.  It was beautifully, yet simply, decorated, and I was already immediately impressed upon walking in the doorway.    The menu options were very diverse without being overwhelming like at some Chinese restaurants.  There were decent typical Chinese $10ish meals or, if you wanted to get something a little more high-end, there were $15ish meals.  We opted for the first, along with a couple of cups of soup.    Our server brought out complimentary fried Chinese noodles with a spicy mustard and sweet and sour dipping sauce, and all of these were tasty.  The hot and sour soup was good, but not as flavorful, peppery, or spicy as some I've had.  The Sa Cha Chicken entree (broccoli, water chestnuts, snap peas, brown sauce) was very good, too, with a \"just right\"-sized portion served on modern dinnerware.  Although denoted as spicy, it too wasn't anywhere what I'd call spicy.  I like some heat!  Some sriracha or hot chile sauce/paste on the table would have been a much welcome addition.  I had to resort to adding heat by using the Chinese mustard.    The service was great and friendly, and we're definitely going back.  The atmosphere alone is awesome, and then you get the bonus of a very reasonably priced, good Chinese meal.",

The first time we ate here I must confess that our meal was so great that when we got home I almost asked my wife if we could go back and eat again. Not that I was hungry (the portions are huge) but that the flavors were that great. Every time I eat here I can't wait for the next time. The Sushi at Ming Fu is excellent; well prepared, nicely presented and full of fresh flavor. As good as the sushi is the full meals are even better. Everything is presented in a very artistic manner as Asian food should be. I love any of the shrimp dishes. They use HUGE shrimp and lots of them. Each of the sauces I have tried with shrimp has been wonderful. My wife likes chicken and is particular about the vegetable mix it is served with. Our server never seems nonplussed when we ask for certain deletions or substitutions. It is always served just as she asked for.  The atmosphere here is very conducive to a nice evening out. The decor is understated and adds a nice touch to the ambiance. The staff is very attentive. We are always treated warmly and made to feel very welcome. We hope to enjoy many more meals here in the future.",

Sushi was decent...nothing to rave about. I ordered the General Tso chicken, which is what I order at every take out place. It was horrible! I took two bites and couldn't stomach it. My wife ordered the Seafood delight and it was very very bland. Scallops were mush, shrimp and lobster was tough, and the sauce was watery. The best thing we ate was our salad, even though they were pre-prepared and our fortune cookie. We've had better \"Chinese\" at hole in the wall take out places...The only reason I am giving this a two star is due to the atmosphere and decor. We will definitely not be back.",

This time the crispy scallion pancakes were soggy inedible pancakes. The Noodles were also quite soggy. Then it took 20 minutes to pay after we were done eating.

Now here comes the part where we are driving and we have no idea where to go out to eat.  We do however know where we don't know where to eat.  We knew we wanted Chinese and being this is Indian Trail/Matthews area there isn't much between here and there (did I mention we were on our way to Costco?)  We did a search for Chinese and Ming Fu came up.  We've always passed Ming Fu and it looks pretty good from the outside. That's our first indication on trying something, does it look clean on the outside.  Well it was Friday Night crazy busy!  The people inside were super nice though.  They tried to be as quick as possible to get us seated.  It might have been because my 11 year old is a loud talker and they wanted to muffle his voice with food...just a thought.  The only critique I have is with the smell. It smelled like my mother-in-laws house, but that could be just me.  I had the shrimp chow mein, it was a nice big serving with my choice of rice.  Two  of the shrimp hadn't been deveined which is a gross thing for me (shrimp poo you know), but otherwise delish.  They serve the wanton crackers as a pre-meal treat.  We asked for another bowl which our server gratefully gave us, but no more than 2 servings (I'm kidding, she took our bowl after the second helping, so I'm not kidding).  For a family of 4 with drinks and appetizers it came to around an average of $13.00 a person.  Not too bad for dinner.  We'll be back I'm sure.",

The beef had a nice spice to it, but it was super chewy and seemed like it might have been sitting under a heat lamp.   The crab rangoon rolls were fine, but a couple of them barely had crab sauce inside.  If you get it, definitely dip it in the duck sauce over the sweet and sour.  My wife did say her Dragon roll was solid.  All and all a safe spot, but i just prefer New Zealand in that area.",

Vegetable tofu soup if heaven, reminding me of my days back in Flushing, NY aka the real Chinatown!  My family alway gets sesame or general tso chicken which is fried and sauced beyond recognition to their delight.  The spring rolls are tasty but they have shrimp so if you are not into it they do have veggie ones but you must specify.  My only issue with the place is that it is a bit pricey but the food is good.  The decor is nice and I love the before and after photos by the rest rooms.  Pretty cool",

They served the crispy noodles prior to the main dishes.  Those noodles dipped into the plum sauce were just fabulous.   Our server was incredibly attentive and simply perfect.  Loved her smile and her energy.   They have another restaurant on Providence Road close to Waxhaw.  I really wish they had one even closer to us cause I'd be there all the time.   I'd put this up against the best of the best Chinese restaurants in Charlotte!   Definitely two thumbs up!",

I always get the sweet and sour chicken, and add beef to my fried rice. My wife typically get the shrimp or chicken and brocolli and crab rangoon and it's always delicious. The only bad dishes we ever get from there is the Lo Mein. I would admit,  although I love this place for the food, price, and convenience (8 minutes from my front door) the Lo Mein has caused me to venture back to my old Chinese spot 15-20 mins away. I always come back though. I sometimes order sesame chicken with light sesame seeds and they have no problem fixing my order to my specifications. The owners are great,  when I call and give my name they usually recognize my voice and its always a pleasant conversation with a few laughs and jokes over the phone giving me more confidence in my order being correct. I never have to wait longer than the 15 mins promised and that's always a plus for me. I would recommend Ming Fu and although I have ventured off, I always return.",

We were looking for something yummy & ordered takeout for our first time here and were happy with everything. I loved the sesame chicken for flavor and generous portions--it was lunch leftovers also. My husband had the orange chicken with a little spicy sauce he enjoyed. The steamed dumplings app had 6 and were meaty and juicy dumplings. Excellent flavors!! I would like to try their sushi too based on the yelp reviews. Takeout was a quick order!",

We ordered Eggrolls and Spring Roll, Absolutely nothing in the Spring Rolls except Cabbage..no carrot or Onion. Egg Roll, just about the same. Pot Stickers, Fried, very weird meat flavor inside and totally limp. Sesame Chicken was actually pretty good. The sauce was sweet and they were fried crisp. Scallion Pancake was another disappointment, as it is my favorite, Limp and not flavorful. Singapore Noodles was the best of anything we had. It had Chicken and Barbecued Pork and Shrimp!!  Very good Curry Flavor. So I don't think I will be back, I was hoping but I was not impressed at all.",

The seaweed wrap on one of the three rolls I had was so chewy it was difficult to get through.  Put it this way: I had to intentionally focus on grinding my teeth through that seaweed.  I didn't have time to raise my hand about it and send it back for a new one, as I was on a defined timeline that night.  I would ordinarily give the chef a second shot at making it right ... but then again, should I have to?  The fish was fresh enough (not fishy ... thankfully, because it was a Saturday night, not a Sunday) ... but it was quite bland.  I love spicy tuna in general, but these rolls barely told my tongue that they were there.  Nice ambiance, and I have a number of friends who enjoy their more traditional Chinese dishes.  I can't speak to that ... just was disappointed to have a weak experience here and can't see much reason to give it another shot.",

However, while eating the waitresses kept lowering the curtains until it was nearly pitch black.  The prices were certainly affordable as it came with crunchy things, salad (ginger dressing was good) and the meal.  Now i've had the sesame chicken before and it was very good but this time i got the fantasy chicken. DO NOT GET THE FANTASY CHICKEN under any circumstances- the \"special mayo sauce\" literally tastes like helmans mayo dished out onto the chicken.  I couldnt even eat it, but I was thankful the waitress brought me some new chicken with sweet and sour sauce instead.  Overall this place was just OK.",

The hostess was very rude and said no, but we could be seated at 2 separate tables. Fine. After being seated, we asked the waitress if it was possible to have our order within 40 minutes, as we had to be somewhere at a certain time. No problem she said. Our table had 4 people. 2 of the people received their orders right away. The other 2 people waited. And waited. And waited. No food. The other half of our party ate, akwardly, as we insisted they eat... we were sure our food would be arriving shortly. After 40 minutes and the other 2 dishes hadn't arrived (a roll and a sashimi plate, which our other party of 6 had already received),  we approached the hostess (Cam, Kam, sp?) about having the food removed from our bill, as we had to leave and the food still hadn't arrived. In the bitchiest manner posssible, she said she knew there was no way they were going to be able to do our food and that they shouldn't have sat us. Well.. that would have been nice to know before we sat down. Rude, arrogant, unaccomodating, just a few words to describe their very unpleasant and unprofessional  hostess.",

    "text": "Not a fan of two in one restaurants, e.g. a Chinese/Japanese Restaurant.  Just my opinion but two completely different types of food, not sure why they're always lumped together.  We still checked it out because we were in the area and found it had good reviews.  A bit disappointing.  Visually a great place, very clean and great decor.  The appetizers were great, we had egg drop soup along with some boneless ribs.  Each tasted great so we thought our entrees would be even better.  We were mistaken.  Sweet and Sour Pork did not taste fresh, was incredibly hard and so was my fried rice.  My wife's fried rice was just as hard and her pepper steak was extremely bland.  Service was pleasant and fast however.  Good lunch specials as well.  Just wish the food was better.",

    "text": "Decent Americanized Chinese and pretty good Sushi.  So it's hard to find good Chinese in the Charlotte area and I was pleasantly surprised by the food I got. I had ordered General Tao's Chicken. It was very crispy with large pieces of chicken and the sauce was great and got a pretty decent portion. I did not want a salad so I ordered the soup and got Wonton soup. Others at my table got salad and its just ice burg lettuce with your choice of dressing (not very Chinese but I was told it was good). Everyone ordered some sort of Chinese dish and 2 in our party ordered Sushi.  The food was good but for the price I would have expected better as far as the sushi and soup\\salads go.   Pros: 1. Our service was great and we had a very attentive server despite it being very busy on a Friday night.  2. it was very clean and up to date as far as the interior goes. 3. Food was good and hot. 4. I'm a sucker for those wonton chips. 5. I love spicy Chinese mustard and boy do they have it!  Cons: 1. They only serve beer and wine. 2. Little on the pricey side. 3. I love traditional fried wontons, which they do not serve.  Along with not serving other traditional Chinese appetizers. (This is not to be confused with crab rangoon)  4. Small inside dining area, This place fills up quick after 6pm during the winter time, it can get very crowded.",

I don't know what kind of ninjas you have snooping around, finding out what my exact likes are and then creating a restaurant to meet those exact secret desires, but it's not fair that you play on all my weaknesses at once.   How Ming Fu will destroy me financially:  - Has great sushi my wife likes - Has a great selection of vegetarian options I like - Tastes better than PF Changs, without the wait - Tastes more authentic than Pei Wei, with more style - Tasty spring rolls - Good selection of interesting appetizers - Really nice servers and hostesses  - A lively but comfortable atmosphere when it gets hoppin - Nice floors - no really, I love their floors, whoever did their decorating did a great job and picked out some nice flooring.   As a person addicted to Asian fare, I like to snobbishly approach a new restaurant like Ming Fu, who covers a variety of Asian cuisine. I found everything so far to be above average to excellent. Looking forward to summer when the front courtyard opens up.",

    "text": "Oh, boy, do I like Ming Fu.  My wife and I really enjoy good Chinese food, and her favorite place to go was always Ming Fu in Waxhaw (Cureton Shopping Center). After a few times there, I was hooked. Now, we live in Matthews, so Ming Fu wasn't our go-to spot, unless we were in the area.  Until Ming Fu came to Matthews.   We found out that it's the same ownership and menu as the Waxhaw location, so we were excited. And justifiably so.  The food is always delicious, and presented beautifully. The chef makes little decorative pieces with the food, such as a bird made from an orange slice on an appetizer, a rose made from a radish for the dinner plates, etc.  Chicken and beef are tender, and seasoned well. The sauces are all done beautifully, and can be adjusted to your needs (like it spicier? just ask). The sushi is great, it's very fresh and tasty. The rice is sticky like it should be, and the fish is wonderful. The soups are good, as are the appetizers.  The service is a little lack-luster at times, but they are always attentive to our needs and genuine.  The decor is very modern, and has an \"asian fusion\" feel to it - lots of dark colors and modern patterns mixed with very classical feeling oriental elements. It's nice to look at, for sure.  Parking can be limited because of the location, but we've not had much of a problem finding a spot.  I always leave satisfied and very happy with the food.",

We walked in and the restaurant was clean looking but the rating was a 93 with that aside we decided to try. After being seated and looking over the menu I order the lettuce wraps the chicken one. My daughter order shrimp tempura roll and a salad. The salad was horrible and tasteless the Ginger dressing didn't even help it. It to was tasteless how do you make Ginger dress tasteless. The food came out quicky making me feel it wasn't fresh and the taste confirm our suspicious. The this food was God awful. Asia food has natural flavor without sauce but this food taste like straight cardboard. I couldn't find the flavors nowhere and my daughters food omgoodness is all I have to say. I asked how was cooking this stuff I really wanted to offer a suggest \"add more flavor\"!",

    "text": "SUMMARY: 2nd time I've been here and had terrible service. Waited 1 hour 40 minutes during lunch and only received my soda. Had to ask the waitress about my soup, and again about my sushi, both of which were \"overlooked.\"   .....  Today marks the second time I've eaten at this restaurant and have had an awful experience. It's literally the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant. I joined a group of several other coworkers for lunch at noon. The restaurant was reasonably busy, but nothing too hectic or full for a lunch hour.   I ordered a coke zero, hot and sour soup, and a Rock N Roll. My coke zero arrived on time, though it was in a 20 oz bottle while the others had fountain drinks. After about 30 minutes, everyone received their soup and salad, except mine, which the waitress seemed unaware that I ordered anything or that anything was missing. She brought out my soup about ten minutes later, but informed me they were out of soup spoons, but that I could just use the small spoon included in my silverware.   After 1 hour, the entrees arrived. The majority of us ordered sushi. The waitress said something happened with their computer, and asked if it was okay if all of the sushi was on one platter instead of separated for each order. This is strange to eat off of a platter in the middle of a large table, so we asked if they could split it up by roll type, unsure of why a computer is necessary to do so. The waitress took the food away and came back with it sorted about 10 minutes later. We had to ask for the sauce bowls, soy sauce, ginger, etc. These items are normally brought out with the silverware.   However, my sushi was missing, and I was told it \"overlooked\". My coworkers finished their meals and asked for their checks while I continued to wait for my food. After about 30 minutes since everyone received their food (we had now been at the restaurant for 1 hour and 40 minutes), they brought our checks and handed me my sushi in a to-go box. The waitress asked if we needed anything else, and we asked to speak to a manager.  The manager came over to our table, apologized, and said that today had been \"kind of overwhelming.\" At this point, there were only 4 or 5 other tables, and the rest of the restaurant was empty. I expressed my concern that I waited 1 hour and 40 minutes and had been unable to eat with my coworkers, and asked if they could wave the cost of my meal. They did so, but did nothing to accommodate my other coworkers.   The food is great at Ming Fu. The prices are fair. The servings are normal. However, none of it is so outstanding that I would be willing to sit through that terrible service again. The service was awful the first time I went (another lunch visit on a slow day), but I figured I would give them a second chance. Stuff happens, and it's not fair to write a long, scathing review because of a bad day. However, my second visit was even worse than the first, and I will not be returning again.  I won't name drop competition (since it will look like I work for the competitor, which I don't), but there are plenty of other Japanese restaurants within a 5 minute radius. I encourage you to go there instead.",

I have been in all 4 restaurants over the years and saw the same thing every time, a dark, drab and dirty establishment with nothing more than bar food and a less than enthusiastic staff. Now walking in you will see a very modern and sleek decor with a nice size sushi bar and plenty of booths and table in the back.   The menu is quite extensive, with something for everyone. The quality was fresh, flavorful and not overly greasy. The portions were a good size and the presentation was, for a few of the entrees, a work of art.   Looks like the owners of Ming Fu got it right. Can't wait to go back and give the sushi a try.",

Overall I would come back and get some take out because it does lie somewhere in between your PFChangs and your strip mall cheap Chinese take out place.

There were a lot of grays, whites and browns, but that's a minor complaint.  I wanted to like the sushi, but, I didn't think there was anything that special about it. I got a few different types of rolls. The sushi rolls were not cheap so I had high hopes for them, but they seemed only a step above what you might buy in a grocery store sushi case. The rolls were a little bland tasting and the ingredients didn't seem so fresh. I can't speak about the regular menu. I may try this place once more, but if the regular dinners are also uninspired, I may have to go further into town for my sushi fix.",
