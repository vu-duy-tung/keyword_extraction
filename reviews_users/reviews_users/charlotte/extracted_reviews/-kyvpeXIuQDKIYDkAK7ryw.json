A great way to start the day.  This location is convenient to Southpark, but it's a little hard to get in and out.  Granted all the intersections in that area are fairly busy, so they probably planned it out correctly.  You can easily see it from the street, but then (if driving) it may be difficult to figure out where you need to go to park, but once you do it once, it's pretty easy.  Free WiFi... and a good place for warm food, studying, or meeting people out.",

But you still may be unlucky enough to encounter Sandra the cashier who brings the customer relations skills of the IRS and the DMV to the private sector.     She was apparently attempting to one-up the mute kiosks by conducting her transactions without speaking.   An outstretched hand silently demanded cash and change was returned without comment or thanks.  The next poor soul in line did manage to get an utterance from her:  'Phone number!' She barked at him.   It seems the Soup Nazi act is much more humorous in fictional sitcom form.   Sandra's name tag indicated she was a trainer of other associates - a prospect that should fill both management and customers alike with dread, unless dear Sandra is held out an example of what NOT to do.",

They brought our food to the table (hadn't seen that in Panera before) and the manager was making rounds.  My friend and I were busy chatting and weren't eating very fast and the manager came over to make sure everything tasted okay and to make sure we were satisfied (he said he was worried because we hadn't eaten much!) and offered to refund us or get us another meal if we didn't like it.  We told him that we were just being chatty gals and the meal was wonderful, but that gesture stood out to me!  He genuinely cared whether or not we were enjoying it.   Panera's food is pretty consistently good at any location, but the manager's customer service made this location stand out!",

Despite these shortcomings, it is near where I work, the staff here are friendly, and with the the MyPanera Program card I get a lot of free food.    Seriously, the next time you visit a Panera ask for their MyPanera Program card.  I swear I always leave with like a grocery bag full of food!  Just signing up gets you a free dessert item (a $1.49 - $2.49 value) on your next visit.  So far I have received three free dessert items and a smoothie.  I would like to thank this location for informing me about the program that I knew nothing about until a visit here.      My favorite thing at Panera is the 'You Pick Two'.  I get the Sierra Turkey on Asiago Cheese Focaccia and the Fuji Apple Chicken salad with bread.  This combo will give me two meals, as the half sandwich is filling on its own.  Just remember, these Panera dishes while tasty and fresh can be very high in calories...don't trust me...check their site.   Overall, while corporate, I do enjoy my Panera and especially love the MyPanera program.  Signup and I am sure you will too!",

Sandwiches, soups and salads are their specialties, as well as a large offering of baked goods. Cookies, bagels, muffins and whole loaves of bread are all made fresh in the store every day.  The \"pick two\" deal is two of either a half sandwich a bowl of soup or a salad, and they have an excellent selection of all. The soups rotate on a daily basis, so it's different every day.  I usually stop here to pick up breakfast on the way to work and the store is busy. Expect to wait a few minutes for your order to be taken as they are busy. The bagels are very good quality and very fresh. The \"everything\" bagel has plenty of sesame and poppy seeds plus garlic, onion and salt. I'd recommend that you ask them to toast it to give it the right flavor and go with the sun dried tomato cream cheese. They have a \"baker's dozen\" special with 13 bagels and two packets of cream cheese.  The coffee urn choices are light, bold, hazelnut or decaf and at this location, they put a note on it with the time the coffee was prepared. Skim milk and half and half are offered with the usual selection of white, pink blue and yellow packets of sweetener. Pepsi product as well as iced tea.",

Some of the greens were wilty / soggy looking instead of vibrant green - when I get salads they really need to look and taste fresh - especially when Panera is now all about clean, fresh ingredients. I usually substitute chicken with turkey and oddly get two very different types so turkeys. Sometimes I get a delicious roasted all white meat turkey breast and other times I get what looks to be rolls of deli turkey meat. Really prefer the taste and texture of the former and not the deli turkey version - the lack of consistency is both surprising and confusing.",

I was one of the only people there-no churchies, no junior league bookclub, no misbehaved children yet-just quiet and peaceful with classical music in the background and free Wi Fi at my fingertips. I love to start my morning off with their Breakfast Power sandwich which is only 330 calories and around $4. Plus, thanks to My Panera program, coffee was on the house. You can't go wrong there. Friendly and efficient staff and tasty, reliable food as always. I can imagine this location being a headache during the week day lunch rush or afternoon crowd during the weekends but I was pleasantly surprised with the desolate setting it offered this morning as opposed to other Panera's I've been to. I will be hitting this up again fo sho.",

Iced tea cooler was empty when I tried to get some and it was still empty 15 minutes later--they should pay attention to everything.  Other than that, nice place to grab a quick bite and a good place to set up shop and study--looks like some people were doing that here.  Loyalty program in place for Panera is terrible.  They reward you randomly when you make a visit and they swipe the loyalty card.  It's supposed to be fun, which I guess it can be, but it's not a good advertising tool.  You don't know what you're going to get or when you're going to get it. For example, my friend only buys sandwiches there and she got \"rewarded\" with a free pastry or what-have-you.  Utterly useless.  No way of really tracking anything so it wouldn't necessarily induce me to go again as a default spot.  dmo out",

    "text": "I am a fan of Panera as a brand, overall, but this location provides some challenges that make me not frequent it as much as I would if there weren't issues (and they are not earth shattering issues, just annoyances that I avoid).  I typically get a pick 2 consisting of soup (cheddar broccoli or potato, usually) and either a salad or sandwich.  Varying levels of fanciness make the cost fluctuate.  Salads have had fresh ingredients, though could use a bit more salad dressing sometimes.  The last ham and cheese on rye that I had was absolutely delicious with fresh bread with thicker cut ham. I also usually get some sort of pastry, which has always been fresh from this location.  They have Pepsi products (bleh), their tea isn't very good (both sweet and unsweet, I haven't tried the flavored teas), so I have been going with the lemonade, which is fine.  The last time I was there, I attempted to get the fruit punch but it tasted like fruity water.  Aside from the drinks, they are relatively consistent in freshness of ingredients and well put together sandwiches.    As with most Panera's, my main issues with this location is parking and people camped out at every available booth with every technological gadget imaginable, or holding some sort of meeting, with one drink on the table that has long since been drained.  The last two times I went, I was balancing my dinner on a tiny table - 1 table (ONE TABLE) of the booths was actually occupied with people who were actually eating and not hiding from their family.  Most people have internet at home, why are you here?!  You know what Panera makes you do?  Wear pants.  I have the internet and drinks at home, and at home I don't have to wear pants (or a bra), so why are all of you people here?  I would vote for one hour of free wi-fi and then you either need to make another purchase or GTFO so paying customers can sit and eat.  Also... the parking sucks, not enough spots, and the spillover parking seems to be along the curb?  I am not sure.  At least two times I have just gone somewhere else because the parking situation was a wreck.  Panera is a good choice that you can make as healthy or as unhealthy (or a happy medium) as you like.  The food here is quite good, even if you have to sit in a dark corner at a tiny table to eat it.",

You are on TV, and it would be terrible for your career.\" I chanted this to myself, over and over again as I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white.    A blue Nissan Versa cut me off, and pulled between those two precious white parking lines with ease.  I couldn't believe it.  I had spent a good 8 minutes driving around, trying to find a parking space! Everybody else is right.  Parking here in nearly impossible at lunchtime.   The rest of the review is necessary. This Panera is like most other Paneras I've been to.  Efficient service, busy at lunch, tasty lunch options. I like how the calorie counts are on the menu board.   Even so: you better be punching those menu items into your MyFitnessPal app first, before buying.  A pumpkin muffin can set you back almost 600 calories, and a half turkey sonoma panini will eat up over 21 grams of fat! Hmm, I like to think the apple as a side helps counteract some of those scary numbers.   Anyway, I enjoy Panera when I have a little more time at midday. The folks who work here are friendly, and I always leave satisfied and ready to get back to work.",

Parking is difficult here during the work week as the location sits right in front of an office building and the lot is relatively small considering the restaurant has to share parking with an AT&T store, a dentist and the offices behind it.  Once inside I noticed this store seems to be laid out a lot better than other Paneras I've been in.  Seating is to the right and not all over the place.  The ordering counter is directly in front of you, coffee is directly across from the counter.  So I ordered my breakfast - bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel and got it to go since I was on my way to work.  I waited a short time because they said they had to cook my bacon but it seemed they were also busy making sandwiches for a corporate lunch.  No biggie.  I wasn't really in a hurry to get to work.  The sandwich was wonderful.  I checked the egg and it looks like they cook the egg there and not use some sort of pre-made egg food like many places seem to do.    So for food alone, I'd give them 4 stars but for parking I give them 2.  It averages out to my 3-star rating.",

I was second in line, but I knew what I wanted. Unfortunately the woman in front of me couldn't seem to remember her own name.   A second cashier named Natasha came up and beckoned for me to come to her register. She apologized for the wait (which wasn't her fault, and in all honestly, wasn't all that long.) I told her it was no big deal and placed my order. She gave me a free drink for my wait! I was taken aback, because it truly wasn't necessary, but a really nice, simple gesture.  Then, after I paid, she asked if I liked brownies. Puzzled, I said, \"Sure?\" She tossed me one, again apologizing for the wait.  That, folks, is how you win a customer for life. She didn't need to do that, but the extra mile left me feeling thrilled about Panera, and that location particular -- enough to Yelp about it!   And the food? Great as always. And the brownie? Yum.",

To my dismay there were several gnats all over the croissants on the bottom shelf. I immediately asked one of the employees to come over to notify him of this. His response was \"um yeah, sorry, this is a problem we haven't been able to figure out\" and then he walked away. I'm baffled and losing my appetite by the second. When I get to the counter to order, I say to the cashier, there are gnats all over your croissants. She replies, \"no they're not\" ... so now I'm truly annoyed. She walks over to the counter and pulls the croissants off the shelf and places them on the back counter, disturbing all the gnats so they now find new homes on the remaining pastries. Finally I ask to speak to the manager. While he was very apologetic and handled the situation far better than his employees, I still didn't witness him throw the croissants away. Or any of the other pastries with gnats all over them. Appetite gone. Certainly not in standing with Panera standards. I won't be back to this location.",

With the cleanliness of the place (which is always on point) and the free wi-if, I can see why.    But what I truly love about this place, is there scones!  It's True... Their scones, buttery, crumbly and flavorful.  Cinnamon is probably my favorite.  They are four dollars yes, but they are happiness, delight and deliciousness all rolled together. Panera also has really delicious flavored coffee and ice coffees.  Where they dropped the ball in their beverage offerings, are their fountain drinks. I can appreciate them trying to educate consumers on how much sugar is in the drink (it is printed on the side of the cup) but it is awful that they don't put any sugar in your drink if you want it.  In fairness they did  have the packets of sugar which take too long to dissolve. On the two days I went there, the sugar pumps they provide for those who want sweetened drinks were empty.  So basically they charge you upwards of three dollars for what tastes like unsweetened Kool-Aid with giant sugar crystals sitting at the bottom.  I don't care about their food menu.  It is like upgraded hospital food.  Not bad enough to complain, but not good enough to rave over either.  I mean they try.  The other day I think I tasted some sweet potato spread on my dry turkey sandwich.  So there is that!  P.S. Parking here is a nightmare!",

And I've tried every day this week to order their new salad and it's not been available single time. Insane.",

    "text": "This is a Panera, like all Paneras. I eat here all the time because it is in my office building. But it's so plain and boring. The coffee is weak. The food pretends to be healthy, but is jammed with carbs. The service is indifferent. There is not a single thing on the menu that I would characterize as special, unique, or noteworthy. Because of the bread, I always leave feeling bloated. If you skip the bread and just get salad or soup, you starve. And it's expensive! Astronomical for what it is. Get it is always packed, including too often with me, because of its convenient location. The sandwiches and salads here are three notches below what you would make at home, and an option only when literally nothing is available or you're starving and in a hurry at work. Often I simply skip lunch rather than eat here. I wish we had a real deli downstairs.",

I then got in line and they only had one young man working the front counter. He was clearly new and overwhelmed and shouldn't have been working the register by himself. He struggled to get the correct order keyed in for the customer ahead of me and left the counter twice to ask for help. I finally gave up after standing in line and left without eating. Not sure how a Panera bread was out of all bagels and cinnamon rolls at breakfast.",

    "text": "What is up with Panera constantly adding and removing the turkey cranberry flatbread from the menu? This is hands-down the best menu item. At first it appeared seasonal then it seemed like they were just holding onto it for as long as they possibly could. Eventually it falls off the menu again.  Well that aside Panera is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I remember being unimpressed by them back in my college days but now I've developed a taste for well...everything. They've got plenty of other good stuff to offer including sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery items out the wazoo. I've recently taken a liking for the green passion smoothie. I also appreciate their many drink offerings outside of the range of \"fountain sodas\". If you're looking for something to grab before a small party or office luncheon I highly recommend the coffee crumble cake. The name is misleading; perhaps the only thing it has to do with coffee is to be eaten alongside a cup of it. The many cookie, muffin, scone and other cake options are endless. Don't forget you can even buy your whole loaves of bread here. I personally prefer more local places if I'm going out of my way to get a specialty loaf.  Prices aren't terrible here. You have to remember quality over quantity. It doesn't seem like they use a lot of organics though. That would justify the somewhat high pricing. Their selection of ingredients is broader for sure. In any case, I haven't met someone who doesn't like a trip to Panera. And this one is close to home so it'll be my new regular go-to location.",

Bagel wasn't sliced/toasted, but no problem - I figured I'd finally get to enjoy a hot, toasted bagel with cream cheese (self applied, which I'm not a fan of but get the economics).   Anyway, light roast and dark roast coffees were both out (this happens much more often than one would think possible).  Wait...   Then I coffee came out, but no lids.   Wait...  still no lids.  So I left, and now have cold bagel and rapidly cooling coffee.    Started review with 3 stars because Panera is generally better but I'm mad about cold bagels, cooling coffee and unnecessary waiting so downgraded to 2 stars.    Oh, and I read in the WSJ this morning that Panera has figured out how to reduce in-line wait times from 8 minutes to 1 minutes.  Well zip-a-dee-doo-dah.",
