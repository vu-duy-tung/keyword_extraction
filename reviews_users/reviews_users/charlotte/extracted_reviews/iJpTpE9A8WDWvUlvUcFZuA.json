When I was there they had a great \"happy hour\" where appetizers and small menu items were about 5.95. They carry Sketchbook Cab by the glass which was my staple and the wait staff is very professional and sweet. The managers are great too.. Say Hi to Julian for me..   My faves were \"The Salmon Salad\" and the \"Chicken Parmigiana\" as well as the \"Wedding Soup\"  and the cute little mini tiramisu in a cup. The take a long time to make a cappuccino though and it is always scolding HOT, so if you are like me and want an after meal coffee, make sure to tell them about 10 minutes before you actually want it.  The main dining room has many big booths and they are great for when you are having a working lunch, you have room for your note pads and things.   The patio is great for chillin out with appetizers and wine in the summer time.. the place does get packed during special occasions, but they move pretty quick..   I used to get sick of Brio, simply because it was the place downstairs from where I worked, but actually it was great to have them so close on those days when deadlines did not permit me to sit down and eat in peace.. the take out is just as good..",

The outdoor dining area was very enticing but the weather a little too windy and chilly. The spacious, pristine dining room however was lovely. Our hostess was welcoming and our waiter patient as our party arrived in pairs. We ordered a bruschetta sampler while waiting for everyone. It was beautifully presented and deliciously fresh as were the bread baskets that arrived with our entrees. The lobster bisque was my favorite part of the meal. It was everything it should have been. The entrees were the least impressive aspect of our meal except for the salmon which was exceptional. The pasta dishes looked tired and overdone. The chicken limone was bland but saved by the mashed potatoes. The meal ended on a high note with a trio of desserts for sharing. There was no clear favorite but there was not a bite left so kudos for the dessert chef. We had to ask a passing waiter for refills on our water but other than that our waiter was knowledgeable and efficient. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I will likely return.",

One of their best appetizer was the bruschetta which they eliminated. The menu was a cut to approximately 1/3 of the old menu.  There was no specials on appetizer and entree. We loved the original decor which gave a Tuscan feel to the place.  We used to love Brio but don't think we will be back.",

For the appetizer had the crispy calamari, entree short ribs, side brussels sprouts. calamari was tender - yet crispy with aioli   short ribs were fall off the bone tender with an amazing sauce sprouts had bacon among other favs in them and were delish  The GM Robert and his crew were amazing - I watched him check every table multiple times to make sure that all of their needs were met. Our server Gary was part of a team of 4 in one of the areas, all of his partners made sure we lacked nothing!. The place was busy but everyone there seemed to really be enjoying their foods, as were myself and my girls. My first time here - it will not be my last. This is a place to go as much as possible, and the cost for the food and service well worth it!",

    "text": "WORST experience. Booked with Open Table for a Christmas Eve reservation. It was raining & there was an accident so called on the way to say we may be running late. Was informed our reservation could not be held more than 15 min. We made it on time. 1st issue- they're supposed to have Valet parking- we get completely out of the car without the 2 valet workers even acknowledging any of us (3) finally, after standing there waiting, my husband walks up to them as asks if they are going to take his keys? Their response, that the restaurant is open but valet is not. HOW RUDE to not even look up and stop someone from stopping and getting out of the car, let alone standing in front of you obviously waiting to be assisted.  Then to the restaurant. My daughter and I walk in as my husband parked the car. We were informed that our reservation has a problem because Open Table malfunctioned and there are no more open tables. It is CHRISTMAS EVE I am immediately panicked, where are we going to just show up????! I go on to ask why no one called me? Their response was that they have been booked for weeks. This was from who I think was a manager or just a very aged hostess. I was beginning to fume at this point. I asked how was I supposed to know that?! We've never even been there before! They were acting as though it was my fault for booking a reservation and not knowing they were booked. Again I asked, you didn't think to call to notify us ahead of time, or maybe during the call I placed saying we may run late?!?! This was absurd. Then they go on to say there's nothing they can do and that if we want to just stay, they have a table but it's in the lobby. LITERALLY in the lobby, next to a waiting couch. OMG it was terrible. Being that my husband just took 10-15 min to park, at dinner time on the eve of a major holiday, I just conceded. Furious, but I was trying not to lose my mind, after all, it was Christmas so we sat. The young hostess shared that people have been complaining. The server, Justin, was great. The food was ok. I was absolutely appalled that a manager NEVER once came by our table in the middle of the lobby to apologize profusely for the issues. We've never had such horrible service. We'd have been better off having fast food I'm comparison! Worst experience!",

We were planning to meet at 7:30 on Saturday night, but we decided an hour before maybe we should call to see about the wait. Thank goodness that we did. They had call ahead sitting. By the time we all got there, we were only waiting maybe 10min. With drinks, that was no time.   About my food, it was excellent - everything. We tried apps, pasta, seafood, and dessert. All delicious. The crab dip was very good. I only wish they gave you more. I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Pasta. Beyond tasty. A little spicy, but delicious. All my favorite ingredients, seafood (lobster/shrimp), mushrooms, cheese, noodles and it had tomatoes and green onions. It was a lot for a dinner portion, so I had lunch the next day. Now on to the dessert. We tried the sampler - Bread Pudding, Creme Brulee, and Apple Crisp, as everything looked good. My favorite the Creme Brulee. Very well made.   Now I saved my favorite for last - their Flirtinis drink. Absolutely amazing! They were medium in terms of alcohol level to me. But they were so sweet and went down smooth. I also tasted the two Sangrias, but the Fliritini was the best.  Loved, loved. I want to go back now.",

    "text": "I was in the Charlotte Piedmont Row area to dine at a different restaurant but it was not happy with the stained decor and cold temperature.  So I left and dined al fresco at Brio.  Brio had a summer special menu with a beautiful picture of a ravioli dish so I ordered it.  The dish contained lobster, shrimp, spinach, and grape tomatoes.  When it arrived, instead of the light and vibrant burgundy glaze, the dish had a pink cream sauce which through me off.  I took a bite and it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either.  I love tomatoes but those tomatoes were brined in something that was very acidic and it was overpowering.  After eating 3 or 4 tomatoes the taste was too much for my palette and stomach so I pushed them aside and continued eating everything else.  The ravioli was good but a few pieces were slightly undercooked because they were chewy and a little hard.  I would order the dish again but without tomatoes and with a different sauce.  For dessert, I ordered the caramel mascarpone cheesecake which is served upside down on top of anglaise.  I asked the server to withhold the caramel and serve it upright.  The first bite was okay but it was not light or creamy like I expected, nor did it have the anglaise.  After several more bites, I gave up on it.  Overall, my experience was okay because I dined outside on the patio and the weather was perfect.  However, my server was nice but not attentive and when I was able to get his attention for something he seemed annoyed.  The preparation of the food could have been better but I'll give the kitchen a \"B-\" for effort.  The reviews on Yelp are mixed so the rating is not the best, I wish management would pay attention to the reviews and make changes for the better.  Nonetheless, Brio is a decent chain restaurant and I've dined at several of its locations, so I will return and recommend it to others.",

There has been a huge shift in staff and menu so if you wanted more of the same then you are out of luck.  The new entrees and drinks are better in my opinion.  No matter what you have heard or think, I recommend you revisit Brio if you are a longtime customer and try it if you haven't ever been.",

We also got the happy hour shrimp it was smothered in parmesan cheese, recommended by our waiter. The food was perfect, the rub was to die for!!! I will try to recreate it at home, I'm not a coffee drinker but bought ground coffee just to make the rub!!! We had a wonderful dinner, the drinks were ok, my mule was just so-so... I've had better, but overall we love the casual beachy decor and the servers are magnificent!!! This will definitely be a hang out for us after a movie or when we need something at the mall. I forgot our server's name but he was one of the best, well educated about their menu, a foody for sure, excited about food! Very relaxing, I like it better than the Great Maple and other restaurants at Del Amo Mall.",

When I suggested it my girlfriend said \"Brio is Yummy.\"  Score right.  So we showed up early for dinner on a Saturday.  The staff was awesome.  Very nice. But my meal was mediocre at best.  I got the chicken limone. The chicken was awful.  No taste and soggy.  The breading on the chicken was beyond soggy.  the sauce wasn't bad, but there was no flavor.  I did however enjoy the mashed potatoes.  My dining companion got her standard which is the Pesce Piccata.  She'd had this dish previously and while her meal was better than mine she agreed it was lacking also.  Maybe that had an off night.  I wasn't so disgusted that I won't go back, but it will be way way way down on the list.  Sorry charlie, this one was a bust.    Oh one last thing.  I ate all of my potatoes, but sent back at least 3/4 of my chicken.  The server asked me if I wanted it boxed up.  I said no, that I really didn't enjoy it and the chicken was soggy.  I was giving honest feedback.  He seemed not to care and I don't know that the feedback made it to the kitchen as I had no manager come to check in with me - I wasn't expecting comps, but at least be aghast that someone is sending back virtually their whole meal to the kitchen uneaten.",

    "text": "My family and I chose to celebrate my dad's birthday this year at Brio's and we were not disappointed. We made reservations for 6:00pm on Sunday night. This was the perfect time, the place was not overwhelmingly busy and our service was fast.   Here's a rundown of our night:   Drinks: They serve some signature sangarias and martinis for only $5 so we helped ourselves to the White Peach Sangaria and a Cosmo. Both were pretty good (a little light on the liquor) but still very tasty.   Appetizers: My dad ordered the lobster bisque. It was fabulous! Very creamy and rich...with perfect flavors...Be prepared to practically lick the bowl! Yum. My mom had the Chopped Salad-cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese and black olives. It was also very tasty! Really good combination of flavors...and the dressing was delicious. I chose the Bistecca Insalata which is basically their version of a wedge salad. It's a wedge topped with Gorgonzola cheese and bacon with a creamy Parmesan dressing. I was a little disappointed with the ratio of lettuce to toppings...I could have used more cheese and bacon BUT the dressing was divine! Like, so good I asked for extra so I could dip the bread in it! Ha.   Dinner: My dad chose the Sausage Peperonata Pomodora it comes with sausage over angel hair pasta and tomatoes....delicious! It was a huge portion and the sauce was awesome! My dad really enjoyed it!  My mom had the crab and lobster cakes again winners...nice chunks of crab and lobster not a lot of filling or breading....I'm still dreaming about them! Mmmmm....I chose the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca with the filet and it was perfect. O.M.G! The meat was so tender and juicy! And the steak came out exactly as I ordered...and that cheese was to die for..I could seriously eat this...again and again! The only downer was the veggies, they were a little over cooked and not seasoned to my liking. But when everything else is so delicious this seems irrelevant!   We were wayyy too full for dessert! But everything on the tray they bring around looked wonderful! I'm definitely trying something on my next visit!   Go ahead! Give Brio a try! It's definitely worth it!",

The shrimp & lobster risotto was over cooked and over seasoned, the chicken Milanese was not tough, over seasoned & cold. The lamb then come out under cooked. The forks were oversized and the new decor left me confused. I will never go back to this Costal nightmare of a restaurant.",

From 2-6:30 (and 9pm-close) they do bar bites in the bar area ranging from $3.95-$5.95. They also have a selection of cocktails ranging from $4-$6.  HH Drink Recommendation: The Italian lemonade ($4) -- vodka, gin & orange liqueur blended with fresh lemonade. It's basically a long island without the Coke ... and it's basically delicious. It's loaded with liquor, so you're definitely getting your money's worth for $4.   HH Bar Bites Recommendation: 100% first order should be the Black Pepper Shrimp ($5.95). It's 12 pan seared shrimp served over crusted eggplant (think eggplant parm without the cheese) and covered in a delicious pepper cream sauce. The Sausage, Pepperoni & ricotta flat bread ($4.95) has great flavors to it. It's just the right amount of spicy sausage toned down with ricotta & a house made tomato sauce. New to the menu is Italian \"tots\" ($3.95.) They're good, not quite what expected. They're basically breaded/crusted mashed potato balls with bacon & cheese. The brio burger ($4.95) is a full size burger served with chips, another great value.  If you're around Southpark after work, this is a great place to make a pit stop!",

I should start by saying that my wife used to work in the Southpark area and ate at Brio many times and always enjoyed the experience. Not so this time. We sat down at the table. I got in after the others in the group because I was parking the car. When I sat down the waitress (Alexandr/as noted on the receipt) never asked me for my drink order. Strike one. She brought out drinks which our friends really enjoyed. She brought out the fried calamari which everyone really liked. She never asked us if we wanted bread. We had to ask for it when the entrees arrived. The entrees were cold. Brio Pasta, cold, Pesto Pasta cold, meatballs as a side dish to salad was cold. Other entree (salad w/shrimp) was OK. We didn't have a lot of time so we all ate and dealt with it. Alexandr did bring some hotter meatballs. We decided to order 4 cappuccinos (which took forever) after we twice told the waitress we had to leave by 4:30 to get our friends back to the airport. The coffees were cold as well. Overall a very poor customer experience and, based on that, I would never go back there. We were embarrassed that our friends first Charlotte experience was at this place. Get your act together folks. You are better than this.",

My favorite dishes are the sausage and pepperoni flatbread (which is incredibly light and crisp, but still filling), the spinach artichoke dip (which comes with some absolutely awesome pita points and is also super tasty), the Brio Burger (which is pretty standard, but still delish) and the frittata al forno (which was my yummy brunch choice)...   The prices are not incredibly high during regular times, so that's good... The patio is really nice on warm days... The only thing is you should definitely go early or late for the happy hour because their bar fills up quickly!

He was friendly and asked us multiple times if everything was good and if we were enjoying our meal as he walked by. The manager Diana was phenomenal. She came by once we were seated as we let the restaurant know that this was a birthday celebration. She was warm and friendly as well and sent over the Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer which was awesome. The spicy pepper sauce is tasty and the eggplant is cooked to perfection. Highly recommend this appetizer!!  Our server was Della and she was friendly and knowledgeable and was able to really make some good suggestions for our main meals. We took her advice and for dinner, we had a special which was the Risotto with Lobster tail and shrimp (mine) and the Lobster and shrimp Ravioli (my husband's). Both were great. Again, everything was cooked to perfection! The risotto was filling and i had enough of my portion left over to have for lunch tomorrow :)  Our dessert was also sent over by the manager and that was a mascarpone cheesecake with a caramel drizzle and that was a wow!!  Again. Creamy, tasty and really just an awesome light cheesecake. I finished my meal off with a cappuccino which again, was really good and wasn't bitter as a cup can sometimes be.  Overall, i'd have to give this a 5 star dining experience because everything was just perfect. So thank you Brio for making this a special birthday all around!",

They have a happy hour menu that is half priced and the food is really good.  They also sometimes have live music.  A great place to meet up with friends after work.  They have some tasty flat breads for both the meat lover and the vegetarian and I am a big fan of the extra dirty martinis!  Yes, extra dirty-the more olive juice in my vodka-the better!",

I got the chicken arriabiatta sandwich, and while it was good there was some less-than-great quality chicken in there.  The desserts are perfectly sized for lunch (espresso cup-sized for $2).  It is almost impossible to resist dessert when it's that cheap and that small. We have also tried the pork chop, the tuna appetizer, and an omelet at brunch - all items were good, but too pricey to be worth it. I'll save this one for when I'm using the expense account.",

I had some Mahi Mahi that was on special enjoyed it, but was not blown away.  I don't recall much about the service, but I think that is a good thing.  Given the upscale environs the price is also good.  You can get away with salad, dinner, and drink for about $30.  The beer selection is minimal, only national brands.  Good spot, sit outside.",

They have a nice outdoor patio and relaxing bar area. Been here for semi-private dining before as well and the space is large enough for a small work function/dinner. I usually get the veal marsala which is is good, though the portion is a little small. All in all a nice inexpensive option to the Piedmont area that contains Del Frisco's & Georges Brassiere",

We always go for the 4-7 appettizers for 2.97 each, most are surprised when they see the portions of these apps for 2.97.  The shrimptini is out of this world, my freind is allergic to shrimp but said how tasty it looked.  The shirmp had the best flavor and cocktail sauce and I dont like cocktail sauce but this will eat.  The margarita flatbread with the goat cheese is so light and wonderful. The steak bruschettaa with balsamic reduction mmmm  we end  up with two orders every time. You have to eat in the bar or patio area for these apps. We sat outside last week and they were great to us. They inclosed it for us and turned on the lamps to keep us warm it was beautiful sitting outside looking up and we werent freezing to death.  If your on a budget this is great a few freinds share some great apps and than head over to San Antonio for the 1 margarita :)",

We went on a Thursday evening in July and we thought some others would be more dressed down.  I later learned the Chamber of Commerce had a party there, which explained why there were so many suits there at 8 pm.  The restaurant was very loud and noisy, which hurts it a little.  The seating is very nice, though, and despite them being very busy I didn't feel cramped or boxed-in. I had lobster bisque for an appetizer and pan-seared tuna for my entree.  The lobster bisque was very good, and at $4.99 was a pretty good value, as well.  The tuna was expertly cooked, and was so tender it melted in my mouth.  The bread was very good, as were the salads.  My wife enjoyed her chicken and pasta dish, athough I am not sure what it was called.  We both felt it was the best meal we have had in awhile.  I ordered the house Pinot Grigiot (can't recall the brand) and it was a very subtle wine with a clean finish that was an expert pair with our meal, and only $21 per bottle.  My only service complaint is that my wine was served after my entree, when I had requested it be served with the entree.  I was eating slowly because I wanted to enjoy my wine with my tuna but didn't want the tuna to get cold, either.  All-in-all I feel this is a good restaurant to visit for Italian cuisine.",

Our server was kind, but we saw many tables eat and leave during the time we were seated, then she brought the check without asking how to split it--she was stressed. We also froze to death in the room where we were seated. Several requests to turn the heat up and we still had to eat with our coats on.  Maybe call before you go to see how they are staffed?",

    "text": "As much as I hate to give poor reviews, two stars is all I can do here. On an evening where my boyfriend and I were being indecisive and broke down and went to Brio, an Italian chain which we very rarely do, we regretted it in a fairly quick manner.   We walked into the restaurant and approached the hostess stand where there were two employees standing. Though they were nice, they stared at us like no one was sure what to do. Finally I had to say, \"just dinner for two\" to be their prompt of interaction with us. We were seated and then ordered the calamari appetizer. It was an extreme disappointment. It was all breading, we could barely taste any calamari. It was crunchy beyond belief, most likely because there was more breading than calamari and it had just became a ball of crumbs. I do like the pepperoncini idea mixed in with the calamari, but it also was overcooked and just not what it could have been. Very far from what it could have been actually.  We then quickly ordered our entrees because we were not feeling it. Not the food, not the staff, and definitely not the ambiance. I had the Pasta Alla Vodka and my boyfriend had the Crab Crusted Salmon. I have to say the Pasta Alla Vodka tasted as if someone opened a can of sauce from the grocery store, added far too much extra Italian seasoning to it and dumped it on top of the (small portion) of pasta. Therefore, unfortunately, resulting in gritty bites of pasta. I do not think the flavors they advertise on the menu came out in this dish at all causing a very subpar dining experience. My boyfriend completed his Crab Crusted Salmon though it was not on the top of his list of seafood experiences. I tasted the dish and my thought remains the same for his dish as mine, minimal flavor experience with the bonus of it being slightly dry fish.   We were not looking for five star dining here and we knowingly came into Brio aware of it being a chain. However with that being said, when you are spending $18-21 on a dish- regardless of where you are- the expectation of the food is to at least be somewhat enjoyable. No one likes feeling like bailing after the appetizer would have been a much better idea than spending $60+ (with no alcoholic beverages) on a meal that was questionable. We have eaten at many other establishments in many other cities, spent the same on the bill, and left happy and full.   Our very shy waitress then brought our check and we departed after signing for the bill with a pen that was covered in (what we hoped was) mashed potatoes. Consider this a lesson re-learned that chain Italian is just not such a great idea.",

Although the food we ordered was quite good, I definitely miss the classic feel of the former restaurant that fit the Piedmont restaurant scene so well. Starting with the hostess that greeted me wearing jeans and a hoodie! Seriously? I get the vibe is more casual now but looks sooo unprofessional. The colors are lighter throughout  the restaurant but the \"coastal\" look they were striving for just doesn't fit...  Service was lacking but the 2 small plates we ordered as well as the Brussels salad were yummy! Miss the awesome bruschetta they used to offer as well as some other classics. They will still probably get the transient customers so we will see...",

The BPM (why yes, I did decide to shorten it) has plates starting at $3.95, including a beef carpaccio that is delicious and a big size portion. You can't really go wrong with anything on this list for the price. I love the eggplant fries, too.  If you don't feel like sitting at the bar, Brio does have a great patio. Like Desiree F said in an earlier review, I don't go here a whole lot. There are just a lot of great places in this area. I've always had good service here. The atmosphere is nice. My last visit I talked to the manager on duty for a long time. She was really sweet. Parking is annoying for me, but that's more because I don't come here a whole lot and all the decks look the same.   Brio has a rewards program. You can get a card or download the app. After five visits, you can get $10 off your 6th.",

I received a gift card to try them again. We went today with our kids before they left for college next week.  The waiter, Anthony, was on point for everything.  We received our drinks promptly and anticipated everything we needed without even having to ask.  But not in a hoovering kinda way.  We had our space to have nice conversations.  The new menu was excellent.  I think I even like it better than the previous menu.  The lobster bisque was awsome.  We all had something different and everyone loved their choices.    We will def go back to Brio. So glad we gave them another chance.  Thanks Anthony for wonderful service and your great wit.",

We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, as well as the mushroom ravioli and Pasta Alla Vodka. I also ordered a Peach Bellini. The drink brought out quickly but after a few sips I decided it was too sweet for me so let my husband finish it. We received the appetizer pretty quickly as well, but soon discovered there was a hair mixed in with it. Someone came over quickly to take the plate away and shortly after, our waitress asked if we wanted a fresh one. We obliged and within a few minutes we were receiving our main dishes. I thought it was odd how quickly they came out. Within moments of receiving the entrees, we received our fresh calamari. We had to work on the appetizer while we ate our entrees. The Calamari was very good and the mushroom ravioli was delightful, but my husband said he was disappointed with the Pasta Alla Vodka. We also noted that all the other tables around us had bread and we weren't offered any. We decided against desserts.",

We were seated right away and our waiter was very attentive. I ordered the pasta pesto and loved it. My sister had the parmesan crusted chicken salad and found it to be less than stellar.

I have never had bad service and the food is top notch. Stellar patio with a cover area if you please. The steak bruschetta is the way to go for an app but I also end up back at the lobster bisque as it is stupidly good even in the summer. I usually wait until they bring the bread at the beginning and then dip it in the soup - your service will bring sourdough bread as well as crispy, thin, seasoned pieces to start off with. I have no clue what the crispy pieces are but they sure are tasty. The beer tends to be a little higher priced as $6 for a Blue Moon is more than I'm used to but hey, welcome to South Park.   Pro tip: Brio is one of many places in South Park that hosts a food happy hour. For this location, stop in between 4 and 6pm to snag discounted apps, like $5 spinach dip or $4 flatbread. Great way to try out Brio at a nice price!",

Anyway, I order lobster bisque at least once a week because it is so good, and inexpensive. It comes with delicious bread. I also order the calamari which is perfect. The portion is great for the price. I've ordered all the items from the Fresh menu and they're all delicious. My family and I dont really like the dessert here. Favorite thing to order: Light Grilled Salmon Fresca When I consider the ambiance, the quality and portions of food, the staff, cleanliness, parking (free valet) and price, I have to say this is probably one of the best choices you can make for dinner in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Today's business lunch was at Brio, and overall the food was quality but the service left a little to be desired. The food: -Calamari: crispy fried but still tender inside; nothing mind blowing but solid quality. Came with a horseradish spicy dipping sauce and marinara sauce, which were both good -Bruschetta Quattro: the bacon and ricotta bruschetta was incredible, the steak was also really good, and the other two were standard but good options. Great app to share! -Side salad: I give this a separate mention because it was HUGE; filled me up before my entree with the apps and was very tasty with fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese -Mediterranean shrimp: only 5 shrimp but they were flavorful, juicy and each were fairly large so no real complaints. The orzo was decent as were the vegetables it came with.  The service wasn't great by any means. Our waitress filled our drinks, was quick to take plates and was fairly nice, but they messed up multiple orders. One of my colleagues specifically asked for no gorgonzola on her salad but they put some on anyway. Then she didn't want to make us wait so she asked for the lobster bisque soup rather than having them cook steak for the salad over, but our waitress returned with minestrone instead. The food was also very, very slow to come out so I would avoid this location at lunch time if you're trying to get a semi-quick bite and get back to the office.",

However, I had a BOGO coupon for this place and decided to check it out. It was a gorgeous night so we had a short wait for the patio area. I like how they have cushioned seats outside where you can get drinks and also eat if you choose to instead of waiting for a table. They had an intriguing selection of wine and I had a smooth, robust pinot noir while waiting for our table.  The service could have been better as our waiter wasn't too attentive. He did the job but forgot an item or two that we requested however the artichoke crusted beef medallions redeemed the bad service. They were absolutely perfect---cooked just how I ordered and they melted in my mouth. It was served with mashed potatoes and a hearty portion of fresh veggies and I couldn't have asked for a better meal. Others got the pasta which wasn't drowning in sauce, which is a nice change of pace compared to some Italian restaurants in the area. The chopped salad was wonderful as well-it reminded me of a greek salad.  I absolutely love the patio area, selection of wine and was very happy my meal along with the variety of their menu. They had traditional Italian dishes along with more modern Italian dishes so you can go old school or new.",

We had our office holiday lunch at Brio and I was pretty impressed with just about everything I tried.  We had a few appetizers--Bruchetta, Spinach and Artichoke dip and the carpaccio served with a crispy flatbread.  Everything was very good.  I ordered the shrimp and crabcakes and they were pretty good.  There wasn't much filling so that was impressive.  They were served with veggies and potatoes.  My co-workers tried the eggplant parm (which was decent, not the best I have had) and a couple salads, paninis, etc.  The portions were pretty small but everything was definitely edible.  We tried a few of their \"dolchinos\" for dessert and the lava cake.  The lava cake was awesome and it was served with vanilla gelato.  The dolchinos were just okay.  The chocolate caramel was my favorite but the cheesecake just tasted like melted cream cheese and the lemon one was pukity.    All in all I enjoyed my time at Brio.  I liked the decor/atmosphere.  It was pretty cozy and cute.  It is a little pricey for what you get so I wouldn't make this a frequent stop and I wouldn't really categorize this as Italian food.  I think it is Italian inspired but it is basically an american grille/chain.  However, if in the southpark area it is worth checking out and I hear their brunch is awesome.",

I did the 3 pieces of steak with shrimp and the brio potatoes. For dessert I had the cheesecake. My husband had the shrimp Mediterranean and absolutely hated it. He said it tasted awful. Everyone else in our group liked their food. Others ordered lasagna, crab cakes, short ribs and ravioli. I wasn't wowed by the food, but it was good although the service was very slow.

    "text": "There's an inexplicable craving that overcomes my friends when they see an upscale restaurant near SouthPark. I can't blame them; great location, valet parking and decor that makes Olive Garden a 70's mom-and-pop Italian Bistro. I could honestly care less about the superficial details of any restaurant. Atmosphere will never hide the taste of mediocre entrees.   And that's the case with Brio. The atmosphere of the restaurant is classy, service is great and made me feel relaxed. This all dissipates when your main entrees are served. You're brought back to the reality that there was a hidden cost to this atmosphere. My order was a Chicken Parmesan with their much coveted \"Italian Herb Pasta.\" When you look at the picture of what I was served you will understand why I have the following opinions.  It looked like a novice chef beginning his first day on the line. Nothing was special about the meal at all. Herb pasta was probably the only part of the dish that had any new or exciting taste bud busting flavors and even that was short lived. I looked around at the other meals being served at my table and it was pretty much the same. Olive Garden dishes in a fancy location. For the record, Olive Garden is just as sub-par and I'm in no way promoting Olive Garden rather providing a comparison for you to visualize. I'm not a person looking for massive quantities when I come into a place like this, but I'm expecting fresh ingredients. The salad was withered and the fresh vegetables looked just the same.   If you're looking for a great dinner atmosphere, then by all means come and enjoy the place. Just remember, \"looks aren't everything.\"",

We had a rather big crowd and got there around 9:30pm; even though they closed at 11pm the service was spot on and very accommodating.  We had everything from the crab and shrimp cakes, grilled salmon fresca, shrimp and eggplant app, lobster bisque, ravioli, lasagna, grilled mahi mahi, sweet potato risotto, and calamari and there was not ONE unsatisfied person. Everything was delicious including the drinks! We were way to full for dessert but this birthday girl was HAPPY!",

    "text": "I've dined at Brio a number of times at various locations across the nation.  I have always loved the food, atmosphere, and service.  Let me also mention that I also always ordered the same dish (Grilled Salmon Salad) on each visit.    It had been a few years since we had dined at Brio so after I received a certificate for a free entree (steak and shrimp) for my birthday, I thought it would be a great opportunity to go back.  There were 4 of us in our party (me, husband, mother, and son).  We started with drinks (Blue Moon, Sprite, Watermelon Margarita, and Peach Bellini).  The drinks were all very good.  We ordered Calamari for our appetizer and I was very disappointed.  The Calamari appeared to be made from frozen, the batter was bland, and the temperature of the dish was luke warm, at best.  Our entrees were also a let down in terms of temperature....especially since we waited a long time for our entrees.  My husband's Sausage Pomodoro was the only dish with steam coming from it, my son's Lasagna was very warm (not hot), and my Mom's Grilled pork chops were barely warm.  I ordered the Steak and Shrimp with Orzo.  The bottom of the scoop of orzo was very warm (not hot), but everything else on the plate was luke warm.  The sauce on the beef was heavily peppered and I had to remove it from the meat in order to eat it.  The Shrimp was also very peppery and I could only eat a couple of them.  When we told that waitress that the food was barely warm, she made a comment that she \"didn't make the food\".  I know that she was trying to be funny, but I really didn't think it was appropriate nor did she try to make it right.  My son and I ordered mini desserts (milk chocolate caramel and tiramisu, respectively).  When the waitress delivered them, she put a candle in mine for my birthday and then told me \"I don't sing, so don't ask\".  Again...I think she was trying to be funny, but it still seemed a bit cold and unnecessary.  On the bright side...the Tiramisu was pretty decent.  The realization of just how poor the meal really was came to light when the bill came.  I've been known to drop some serious money for a great meal and I will never complain about price as long as the meal is great.  However, to have sub-par service, luke warm food, over seasoned sauces (and under seasoned calamari), and a sassy waitress it sickened me to pay $160.00 for that meal!       Sadly, I'm quite sure that I won't be going back to Brio anytime soon.   There are too many good restaurants in South Park to go back to one where I've had a bad meal.",

The area is really new and clean, so it can be nice out there. As for the bar area, it was kind of crowded, but there was a sweet live band. Oh, and lots of ladies in their 40s getting crunk and getting down... It was kind of awkward for me because there were only a couple people in their 20's there, but at the same time, it was pretty interesting to see, lol.  I really only came here to eat though, and have a couple drinks before going out. Food was on point. The bread and crackers were delicious. I preferred the crackers; there was cheese on it or something. We started off with some calamari and then I had the veal marsala classico. Calamari is always good anywhere-- the pieces were pretty large too. It came with two sauce, a mayo that I thought was too rich in taste and a marinara sauce. I like to mix the two... My main dish tasted great. Not sure how to explain the sauce... I really like mushrooms too! I enjoyed how the vegetables and potatoes complemented the veal. mmmM!   Ask for Edith, she's an amazing waitress/bartender!",

The Pasta Brio had lousy tasting sauce, a couple bits of chicken and a few mushrooms.  It makes you wonder if the restaurant is trying to save money by giving out very little chicken and vegetables in the dish.  My husbands pasta was not very tasty either.  A friend had lukewarm lamb chops even though the plate was warmed up.  He was given a few pieces of asparagus too.  The wine was served in stemless glasses.  A huge no-no if you know anything about wine.  Our server was very nice, or I would have given one star.  Brio is overpriced and has crummy food.  Sad",

Caprese salad was anemic and frumpy. (I know they are out of season). Calamari Salad was in strips (never seem that before) though, I will say, the aioli was delicious. Salamon Salad was blah and uneventful to say the least. Average at a high price.  Meomi Pino for $18 for 9oz when I can get a full glass of Caymus up street at Burtons for $20!  No thanks. Checked the box on this restaurant. Have no reason to go back. Love the Piedmont Row area at night but go elsewhere for a good meal.  So many better, no chain, restaurants in South Park to waste an evening here. Basic at best.",

I far prioritize quality over quantity but this had neither.  I took it back and was told that I should contact corporate regarding the new portion sizes.  Management did not take responsibility for the poor quality of food served.",

Everything tasted delicious and you were given great-sized portions!! I would absolutely recommend that you come here!! I got a Mediterranean vibe with the decor and natural lighting.

This place always has music and the band playing Friday night was excellent--dance floor is way too small, but they do a great job where isn't too loud--you can try to dance if not too crowded, and you can have a conversation. The service is always excellent, and we always have a wonderful experience.  The wait staff is always friendly.   The 3 star rating, was for the food - not consistent, and this is a chain--I've been to a Brio in Orange County, CA.  The meal I had were the beef medallions with mash potatoes and asparagus.  The food was cooked well, but the flavors didn't seem the same.  The crumble they put on top of the medallions seemed tart.  My companion had the Lasagna Bolognese.  The lasagna is filled with the Bolognese but they cover the top with an Alfredo/cheese sauce.   She thought it tasted like processed cheese--she didn't finish her meal. This is probably the first time we've had food we weren't crazy about.  The wine was excellent, and they always have nice warm bread.  I almost forgot to add, we had the meatballs and polenta from the small plate menu--and I could make this a meal--the meatballs and sauce were delicious, and the polenta with a smoked Gouda,  creamy and a perfect match. Put this in a larger portion and make it an entre!!!",

    "text": "I used to love Brio and have been here quite a few times. Unfortunately something has changed drastically. My 2nd to last visit was in February 2017 for my dad's birthday and it was a wonderful experience, from the food to the service and half off bottles of wine (on a Friyay!). I chose Brio again to celebrate a new job (July 2017) with my friends and family and unfortunately, we ended up leaving shortly after getting there.  It felt stuffed and chaotic. We did go on a Saturday evening but it shouldn't take away from the dining experience. We ordered a round of drinks (6 ppl). Two drinks were super watered down and the rest of us had wine. Then we take a look at the menu and I was completely disappointed. A lot of the GREAT entrees were no longer there and the menu itself didn't spark our interest. Not to mention service was eh! Bring back the old Brio please.",

It's a bit pricey, so probably need another coupon before I return. Can't wait! Dinner with one mixed drink, one glass of wine and one beer; two entrees and one side salad was about $77. Coupon helped...$20 off.   Great job Brian Wells, GM!",

    "text": "I heard many raving reviews about Brio so I was excited to take my sister in law and other relatives there to celebrate her birthday. I was so embarrassed after dinner that I had to apologize for not taking her to a better restaurant. First of all the food is way over priced. You would be better off going to Olive Garden you could probably save more time and a lot more money and the food taste much better. My sister in law had a hair in her food. After informing the waiter they simply \"replaced\" the dish without giving her an option of switching out her meal. Now I have been to a restaurant that had a 71% sanitation score and I have NEVER had hair in my food.So why would I pay close to $100 dollars to start? My brother ordered the lobster fettuccine and the noodles were like gum although there was a healthy portion of seafood. I ordered the carbonara and it was bland and they also used rigatoni noodles which I thought was very weird. Had it not been for the healthy portion of Parmesan cheese that I requested I would not have been able to eat the few bites of food that I consumed. Again, this was a birthday dinner for my sister in law so when I made the reservations on Open Table I noted that it was her birthday. Nothing special happened. No happy birthday, nothing. Why even have that as an option to note if you are not going to do anything special. The only thing that was good at the table was the calamari, but how hard is it to fry some squid and drizzle sauce on it...Also, the place is beautiful, but I would not  be spending my money at Brios again, because you can't get full on ambiance. If it wasn't so late when we left I would have asked to speak to the manager so I could get a refund for the garbage I ate. In fact, they should have paid me for eating that mess. If I could leave no stars I would. If you are considering eating here RUN!",

Within minutes he was given two large (6-8 people) tables, and that was it. We were on our own. The food tasted good, but portions were small. This is rather surprising since pasta is sooooo cheap. Twice as much pasta, with the same amount of sauce and additions would have made a huge difference and cost pennies. What a shame. We were sitting in a booth adjoining the backside of the bar, and the music from the live entertainment was so loud we couldn't hear each other, even when raising our voices. Yikes! Dessert tray brought to the table had 3 choices. We were told there were other choices, but they wouldn't fit on the tray. Seriously? We decided against ordering one. I've been to Brio for private parties, and they did an excellent job. Plenty of attention from ample staff.  Brio has all the ingredients for a great Italian restaurant, but is getting the proportions out of whack. Small tweaks could really improve this place.",

Not everything is amazing but there have been some stand out things.  I love LOVE their sweet potato and chicken risotto!! Seriously I would cry if they got rid of it. I don't like asparagus but I will eat it in this that's how good it is lol.  My partner in crime absolutely loves the Ravioli di Bello (lots of mushrooms).

This menu changed my feelings about Brio as every other time I have been here the food was very good. I started with the caesar salad which was overdressed and small. Then I had the shrimp orzo - spicy jumbo shrimp served with orzo, asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes and lemon vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was probably the most tasty thing on the plate. The serving was large and for the most part, tasty. For dessert I chose the tiramisu however they informed me they were out at 6:30pm so I opted for the cheescake which was very good. The desserts were mini sizes served in shot glasses. I didn't feel like the meal was worth $30 and if you added up the same items on their regular menu, it only comes to $28 which makes me wonder why I didn't calculate this before ordering the 3 for $30 menu! I was disappointed in the end and probably won't be coming back here for restaurant week again. In general, I like Brio. They have great cocktails and normally good food and portions.",

It was lunch, we were starving so we stumbled in. They seated us quickly, the ambiance was pleasant but not note worthy, we outside in our disturbingly quiet area and found it quite pleasant. Ladies who lunch, dripping with jewels and puffy clouds passing by, then it came down to the food.   Brio is a great place for lunch for people who have already eaten lunch because the portions are small.   I had crab and shrimp cakes that were miniature in size at best, with a side of veggies and potatoes drenched in olive oil.   As tasty as it all was, I would have needed to eat bread with two hands for an hour to fill me up.   In closing, nice and quiet during the week, good food, expensively priced but if I was in  in town again...I'd probably go back.",

My husband got the crab cakes. We're not familiar with crab cakes, but the people we were with said they were the best they've ever had. The rolls were sourdough, my favorite!   This was my first time eating in Piedmont Row. We ate out on the patio to enjoy the sun and watching all the other people doing the same. There's a great fountain in the middle of a variety of restaurants...makes it feel high end. Atmosphere was beautiful.   The service was great! It made for an easy afternoon and I could have stayed there all afternoon.   Bathrooms were spacious, clean, and private.",

It was a failed attempt at portion control. You know when you're at the point where you're really full, but it's too good to stop eating and you've eaten too much to take home? Yeah.. that's where I was lol This is by far, my FAVORITE place for eggs benedict. The waiter tried to convince me to sway away and get the \"Berries & Cream French Toast\" which is brioche stuffed with marscapone cream cheese and topped with fresh berries and a vanilla cream cheese drizzle. He made a very convincing argument, but I was craving the eggs benedict. The french toast sounds amazing though so I'll have to try that next time!",

When I went to pick up the delivery i could not figure out where to park they were kind enough to get the some one deliver to my car (so i could not check the order contents when I took the delivery. The total was around $167 and with tip the total was around $200).  Only an hour later i realized that my vegetarian dish in the order was missing and I called up the location to report the issue. Not only did they put me on hold for about 20 minutes after which some one finally put me in touch with the manager Diana. She was pretty rude and was basically told me that I was lying about the missing \"fettuccine rustica\" and said that the chef was 100% sure that the order was there.  Never have i received such a rude service in the service industry. As a precautionary note to folks putting in bulk orders please double check before you get the delivery. I would suggest that you avoid this place altogether if you are ordering takeout.",

    "text": "NOTE: this review and rating are for the dinner main dining room experience.   For the life of me I don't understand why I keep getting really bad dinner service at this restaurant, which is unfortunate because the food and ambiance are both of decent quality.  This past Friday I went to meet up with my friends at Piedmont Row for the golf tournament after party. I suppose all the establishments were aware of the special event and thus the crowd.  After mingling and enjoying a cigar, we came over for a quick bite. The hostess was nice and prompt, but that's the end of the pleasant experience. I don't recall the waiter's name, likely because he never greeted us or introduced himself. Heck, I don't think he smiled once. I guess he was on his \"barely minimum effort\" mode.  He barely paid attention. He barely took our order and brought our food.  I had to wait until my soup was cold to get bread to soak it with. The kicker was when the only guy at our table of 4 said to him \"put the appetizer on my bill,\" he came back with the appetizer split among all of us, then looked at us like we caused this, and half heartedly offered to redo the check by his manager (as in he had no intention of redoing it). Our guy friend felt awful, and we were all pissed.  Oh, the food was good, the soup is always delicious, and the mushroom ravioli could have more sauce. But the service was so bad we couldn't really enjoy the food.   MANAGEMENT: if you are reading this, please be selective with who you hired. This is my 2nd time stuck with the most uncaring server (ironically the same booth, 2nd to the last row, 1st booth near window). If they don't want their job or tip, I am sure someone else would.   To end on a better note, they have a great happy hour menu, which restarts after 9pm. And their bar service is normally consistently decent",

Calling on the day of for a reservation for 22, the manager was very accommodating, waiving the requirement that all meals be on one check. She let me know that gratuity would be included and in the future, reserve the back room in advance. All VERY fair.    Brio was great getting my guest seated upon arrival. In a perfect world, everyone shows up at the same time, but that's unrealistic. Brio was so patient.   My only complaint is with the food. When I attended for a Yelp event, the salmon was to die for. You could taste the charred/smoked flavor and it was perfection. My birthday salmon wasn't quite as flavorful. I'm thinking the head chef was off duty for the night. That being said, my guest were pleased with their meals and happy to have eaten at a place where they had not yet dined. I'll be returning to Brio on a night without so many people. This was a very positive experience and I'd highly recommend Brio for a group dinner, date night, or quick bite with friends.",

Our server was very friendly and gave great selections.   The bread that they serve is fresh and warm. We each started off with a salad. I got the kale caesar salad. The dressing was so good!! The toppings added a nice touch to it. My husband also liked his salad. I got the lobster and shrimp pasta. It was a pretty large portion. The shrimp and lobster was good but slightly overcooked. The sauce was good and wasn't too salty. My husband got the salmon and was pretty pleased with it. The prices are decent too.   This restaurant is great for all occasions. It's perfect for a date night!!",

I couldn't eat it so my poor husband switched with me. Tried his pasta dish and sent it back because pasta was cold and flavorless. The shrimp also did not taste fresh. Swapped it out for pan seared salmon which was a lot better but nothing special. It was Mother's Day so I know it was a busy night but I expected a lot more from such a nice place. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone which is surprising because I love the Brio in Pembroke Pines, FL. They were just night and day and not a good representation of what the Brio in South Florida taste like.",

I ordered the Mezza Shrimp Risotto which came with a side salad. The Risotto was some of the best I've ever had and seasoned perfectly and shrimp were tender. The Chopped Salad was fresh and came with two containers of dressing. Both of the dressings were wonderful.  Enough for leftovers for dinner.  I've also ordered the Beef Carpaccio several times and always a winner. It's like you build a craving and must have when needed. Coupled with the bread basket which includes warm sourdough bread...wonderful.  I've also ordered the 6 oz. Center Cut Filet and was excellent though I didn't care for the Crispy Fingerling Potatoes Brio. Next time, will order the mashed potatoes (hopefully with gravy!).  The Grilled Steak Salad did not rock my world. It was basically very few steak \"nuggets\" on top of a very basic garden salad. The steak lacked flavor, was overcooked and I prefer receiving strips of steak and not nuggets. That's just me. The salad below needs work to make more exciting. The first time I haven't taken home leftovers.  I have yet to try the warm chocolate cake but is definitely on my list to try. Had the lobster bisque and wasn't thrilled. A bit too dense and not a sign of lobster anywhere (a few pieces would be nice).  Nice people, great service and wonderful restaurant with free parking nearby (if needed).",

I think this restaurant is perhaps one step above Olive Garden in terms of quality however, I prefer Olive Gardens spaghetti. The service was ok, our waiter could have used some training and the forks that are at the table we're huge, I think they were serving forks not dinner forks, which made it a little uncomfortable for me to twirl and eat my spaghetti, I was a little surprised, especially for an establishment like that.",

Make it even more special, it was the day that the earnings came out for BBRG - only if I had bought stock in them back in April, I could've had Brio paying for my dinner based on the stock price!  Oh well.  Gotta go for the pork chops.  A co-worker of mine who hadn't dined there suggested I get the pork chops and being the malleable easy-going dude that I am, I said why not.  Pork chops were the best ever. Hands down - I don't know/care what else is on the menu, but it was, as my friends like to say, bomb diesel. :/  Truly a 4.5 - the only thing that kind of killed the 5 star potential was the desserts.  The creme brulee, a standard of any good restaurant, needs to be immaculate.  Theirs, however left much to be desired.  Thin crust and it was actually burnt a little bit - worst part was they tried to camoflauge it by putting a strawberry on top.  Sneaky, sneaky, but you won't get passed me!  Like I said, everything aside from the creme brulee was ON POINT.  I'd like to think my first date went well too because I was so funny, good-looking, smart, and of course, modest... but on balance, it was probably the restaurant that did all the legwork.

    "text": "After reading all the great reviews for this place, my friends & I decided to try it out for a friend's birthday. Unfortunately we left disappointed and underwhelmed. I guess that's what happens when you've been spoiled by Zebra Restaurant!  We went on a Saturday night at 6:30. The place looks nice and there is a lot of staff on hand at this time. Our server however didn't give off a very friendly vibe. Maybe she was having a bad day or was just busy, but we all sort of felt like nuisances, and we hardly ever needed anything extra (and I've worked in the food industry--I know annoying tables very well).  I ordered off of the light menu. None of our food took very long (even though the restaurant was a little busy) which is why I'm giving three stars instead of two. The only thing is my dish wasn't very filling. I know some people think, \"Well, healthier means less satisfying.\" That's definitely not the case--if it is, you're doing healthy food wrong. It was pretty tasty, just not really enough for dinner.  We were in and out in about a half hour, which on a Saturday evening wasn't at all what we expected or even really wanted. Maybe if we had another server we wouldn't have felt like the place was an \"eat and run\" restaurant. It's a little sad when more casual restaurants have better servers than those that are supposedly \"nicer\" restaurants. I will say though that the gentlemen going around helping to refill drinks and bread baskets were very nice, and everyone else looked to be enjoying themselves. It's too bad because we'll happily spend plenty of money on great food (and more on great service).  I doubt we'll be back.",

When we went on a weeknight, there was a live band playing in the bar area. It was nice to see, although a little too loud if you were seated nearby in the dining room.   Food: There is a variety of food you can choose from the menu. I played safe with angel hair shrimp scampi. It was good and fulfilling. My husband ordered chicken pasta in white sauce, that he liked. Overall, the food was not bad at all. I would definitely come back to try other food items. We made room for dessert, chocolate molten lava cake that we ending up crushing :) in less than 10 minutes. Need more vanilla ice cream!  Service: good and attentive. Our waitress was kind and offered suggestions in placing our order.",

Every day they have really good lunch specials and also have a lunch menu which gets you smaller portions of their dinner menu at a discounted price.  Still plenty of food as well!  One of my favorite items on the menu is the Wood Grilled Salmon Salad!  The fish is always cooked to perfection and the vegetables in the salad are so fresh!  I've also had their panini and the Lobster Bisque!  Can you say decadent?  It is so creamy and rich, you could have a bowl of bisque with a small side salad and it would fill you up!  Plus, you get a yummy basket of bread and crispy flat bread when you are seated and its yummy!",

If you go right after work you can get a great spot on the patio. Our favorite dishes are the spicy eggplant/shrimp appetizer and the beef carpaccio. The eggplant/shrimp dish is scrumptious; it has a very yummy sauce and the carpaccio is HUGE, especially for an appetizer. It comes out in the biggest plate you will ever see and has a tasty salad, flatbread slices and capers on top to make it even better. If you sign up for their rewards card/app, they send a lot of promotions to lessen the pain of the bills. Almost every time I have been in we were able to get at least $10 off by using these offers.",

The menu is a bit overwhelming and the smell in the place is so delicious you feel full when you haven't even eaten anything.  I had the ravioli - so fresh and delicious.  The sauce was light and tangy - not too garlic-y.  It was way too much food - I had to get a to-go box.      The dim lighting makes everyone gorgeous - this is a great place for first dates!",

The Chicken Parmesan (called something else) was all breading and so heavy on the grease. And all you could taste when eating the pasta was butter. This will be my last trip there, but it was a great run while it lasted.",

I must admit that my sole reason for choosing it was due to a $20 off coupon, as the average Yelp reviews left me somewhat unenthusiastic. I must admit though that following our late dinner here, I found very little to complain about.  Prices are steep with most dishes exceeding $20 (but hey that's to be expected, this is Southpark.) My wife and I both went with the Pan Seared Salmon served with steamed spinach and baby fingerling potatoes. Freshly made bread was also included.  Everything was perfectly prepared and delicious; however, when compared to our favorite Italian restaurant, nearby Maggianos, serving sizes were somewhat lacking. This may be attributed more to Maggiano's being so large than Brio's being too small.  Comfortable and attractive seating is available on the patio, around the expansive bar and in the ambient, low lit dining room. The patio included live music. Our young server, Shaq, was friendly and attentive and the manager stopped by to check on us. Overall the restaurant reflected exceptional management. Sanitary rating was an impressive 97.5.  I recommend it wholeheartedly and expect to return.",

There was a sign out front thet they had valet parking, but I waited a while and didn't see a soul, eventually parking myself.   Drinks-  It took them over 30 minutes to get some people drinks.  Park of the problem here was because they only had one server taking orders.  She also served glasses of water.  Why not put glasses on the table BEFORE people get there and have pitchers?  The bartender also didn't even know how to make a drink.  Food- The shrimp were clearly pre-frozen, with a chewy texture to them.  The Chicken and Rigatoni had penne pasta in it, not rigatoni, with some sort of off-taste sauce.  I could barely eat it.  The lamb chops were served RAW to those who tried them.    Service- Great service by the two waiters who helped us, but they should have had 3 for a party our size.    Manager was brand new and was clearly walking into a mess.  Fire the cook, get new menus, and staff accordingly and maybe you will be around in 6 months.  With so many great places to eat in Charlotte....",

Food that would have not even been worthy of my review.  The chicken pesto seemed as if it was from the frozen section of Wallmart. That meal was $20 roughly.   My salmon was $23 but when it came out... shockingly, I wondered if my 15 year old son had plated the dish and was hiding behind a camera. So needless to say, I figured perhaps it tastes better than it looks? No? That's why I am giving this place a 2 start review.   The fish didn't have any color. High quality salmon is something I am very familiar with. The spinach was horribly soured by and overdose of lemon and I could go on and on.   Bottom line, I won't recommend this place to anyone.

The first plate I order , I had to send it back. I really didn't like it. It was like a spring Pasta salad.  They change it with no problem. Great customer service ! Then I ordered the lobster raviolis and spring salad and it was delicious. Lemon sauce that was drizzled on top of the lobster ravioli just to die for. I had a peach sangria, one of the best I had.",

They were not busy at all which I wondered why not on a beautiful sunny Saturday. I ordered the mushroom ravioli it was great. My friend opted for brunch and said the potatoes were great. For dessert I had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The best thing about the dessert was the ice cream so I don't recommend it. Overall I enjoyed the experience, cost was $25.98 plus gratuity, but I was still hungry when I left and when the valet attendant brought me my car I was on the phone getting a takeout order from Sauceman's of the brisket plate. Lol I would go back but next time order something more filling.",

    "text": "Our first experience at Brio was in Raleigh at the Crabtree Mall location which was one of our favorite restaurants.  Delicious food, fantastic service and just an all around good time.  This Brio hit some of those criteria, but unfortunately not all.    The first thing you should know is the location is beautiful.  The decor is stunning and the plaza the restaurant sits in is very pretty.  Very impressive curb appeal.  The bar is immaculate and the seating is very elegant.    To be up front, this was a four star visit for everything besides the service.  From the moment we were seated, our server was completely disinterested.  It took forever to even get started with drinks and bread (another server had already started two parties that same after us and asked if we'd been helped.  When we said no, she said oh I'll go get your server.  Very unimpressed for a place like Brio).  He was very unfriendly and disconnected throughout our entire lunch and unfortunately knocked the experience down a star.    The actual food, however, was fantastic.  The Gin Gimlet and Strawberry Fresca drinks are fantastic, the spiced crackers you're started off with are very good, while the bread was disappointing (good, but served with butter and not olive oil, strange for an Italian restaurant.)  I went for the Pasta Brio which was excellent and highly recommended.  Overall, a good lunch experience but one that left me wanting just a touch more.",

    "text": "I came with with my husband and my parents and we were seated towards with back with maybe one more room after the section we were in. The music from the bar played throughout the restaurant and my step-father LOVED the music. The fresh bread was DELICIOUS sourdough that I devoured.   We ordered beef carpaccio and the burrata app to share and my husband and I each had the Della Casa salad (no pasta crisps on top for me). The carpaccio was served with excellent presentation and was delicious. While he burrata was a pretty plate, the portion was significantly less Wow-worthy. The burrata tasted good and the fresh basil accompanying it was tasty. The salads were tasty but small portions.   We ordered a Meioma (sp?) Pinot noir to share which was delicious and they let us use a decanter to aerate the  bottle faster.   For entrees, I had the lamb chops rare and while they were cooked nicely (some less rare than others) the Marsala sauce was sooooo salty it took away from the dish. It was also very hard to cut off of the bone in a bowl, so I think a plate would be better serving style. My husband had the fettuccine (or linguine?) with lobster and shrimp. He said the pasta was fresh, meal was delicious, but he portion seemed small. My mom had the 9oz center cut steak and loved it. My step-father had double cut pork chops and loved them. We substituted a lot of sides like roasted potatoes instead of mashed and I was not impressed with the roasted potatoes. I also substituted broccoli for asparagus and was unimpressed because it looked like it was poured from a bag of frozen veggies, unseasoned.   Our server was excellent. (I believe her name was Amanda.) She took our loud group and laughed with us, and she was very friendly and efficient.   Overall a good experience with a few flaws that could improve overall to make it great.",

We had to wait for everyone to get there before they would seat us.   I got a cocktail which was pretty good, but unfortunately I don't remember what it was called. We started with the bruschetta sampler. All three of them were delicious. I decided to get the pasta a la vodka for my entree which was just ok. It wasn't a very big portion.   Our service was surprisingly really bad. We waited a very long time for our server to come and then we had to ask to order drinks. It took our drinks and food a very long time to come out. She was slow to bring our check as well. When she was telling us about the specials, she was talking so quietly that only 2 people in our 8 person group could hear.   All in all, the food was ok and the service was bad. I won't be rushing to come back.",

The patio is awesome and the chairs are comfy.    We ordered Moscow mules.  There were a little sweet but still good.  The waitress brought out bread right away, this was a change from the first time.  Really nice getting our drinks promptly and having bread!  We ordered the pepperoni flatbread, calamari, and a Caesar salad.  The flatbread was really good and had a lot of pepperonis on it.  The calamari was decent, but a little soggy in the sauce it was sitting in.  The salad was very different from any salad Caesar salad I've had but I thought it was good.",

Very good.   The risotto wasn't the greatest as I've had better in Denmark of all places...some porridge shop but the shrimp were plump and a good size. For lunch you'll get the risotto and soup or a salad. On this cold day, the bisque was it.   The burger was a double patty with special sauce and no onions. Toasted bun and I was impressed enough as I got a sample plus the fries are tasty and seasoned well.   We returned, SAME DAY, for the Happy Hour special and really WON!  Nope, the 30% off doesn't apply to additional deals and it shouldn't. Yo, everything is $5 on the bar menu. $5. $5 $5   The shrimp and eggplant is my new go to!  Tried the quesadilla AND it had no meat = okay.  Tried the napoli shrimp and I don't care for it for me as I need my red sauce limited to certain items and shrimp ain't one of them.  Tasted the nacho's and the chips were fresh and well seasoned. Didn't eat it with the toppings.  Service is a tandem thing here and that's the best part. They need to workshare so the customer is never left behind.   Live music was setting up on our way out.  Relaxed atmosphere.   The lobster & shrimp risotto is back on the dinner menu.  Lemonade is NOT fresh sequeezed but instead is OUT THE PACK. Insert emoji eyes here.  Anywhoo, you should give this place a good great once over.  None of the fried items were greasy nor heavily weighted with batter nor old grease.  Kudos, Brio!  The family was impressed as well. Considering that includes Gen Z to the Greatest Generation - I'd say you're winning.",

We went to dinner there last night and everything we ordered was very blah. We started with brushetta, which we used to get a lot. It really had very little taste. I ordered the bolognese, which is really hard to mess up. It was very dry and again pretty tasteless. My Mom ordered salmon - she said it was terrible. She kept putting salt and pepper on everything trying to get some taste. This place is not cheap so to spend $60 on dinner and it be this bad is not acceptable. I am surprised there are so many good reviews. It was really comparable to Olive Garden but cost a lot more. It's really a shame because it's a great location but I will not return.",

At that time, I made a mental note to introduce my wife to this restaurant and finally got a chance.  Cold wet rainy day and my wife wanted to go to South Park which is a couple of blocks away.  Drove down from Cornelius and took advantage of the valet parking which was nice in the rain.  It was a pleasure to get inside the restaurant on such a day since the have a nice warm inviting atmosphere.  We were seated pretty quickly and our server was there immediately . Service overall was good but not quite up to what I had experienced on the Elite Event but from what I could see, the issue was short staffing because our server was trying. Just spread out a bit too much.  When she took our beverage order, I ordered a nice cup of hot coffee which was perfect on the cold wet day. My wife ordered a Peach Bellini which she enjoyed.  My wife had already decided on Soup and Salad for lunch, particular after she found out the Soup of the Day was Butternut Squash.  I order a soup course also and I had a great Lobster Bisque that was very flavorful, great texture and plenty of Lobster in the Bisque  For her Salad, she had the Della Casa which was a nice salad which she enjoyed.   I had the Spaghettini with Meatballs which was OK but at the same time, not outstanding and I would order something different next time we visit.  All and all, it was a very good lunch. Good atmosphere and good food.  Will be back next time in the area.",

This location has complimentary valet which is a huge plus given the location.  The restaurant is HUGE so it can get a little loud, but not overly so.  Outdoor seating was not open when I was there last weekend, but can imagine it would be a great place to sit.  The food is absolutely delicious.  I really wanted the Lobster & Shrimp Fettuccine, but wasn't sure about the \"spicy lobster sauce.\"  The waitress was great about explaining the level of spiciness and after seeing me still look uneasy, she offered to have them make it without any spice at all.  It was so delicious - I will definitely get it again on my next visit.  We also got the Bruschetta Quattro appetizer which was delicious, but 3 of the 4 varieties came with meat.  I suppose we should have looked at all the bruschetta descriptions since the Quattro isn't described, but my mom's a vegetarian so she had to stick with the only vegetarian option.  Regardless, they were still yummy.  All of our meals out in Charlotte are delicious, but this one definitely stands out!",

The mashed potatoes needed mo butter imo, but no big, I stole some from our bread and slapped it on those puppies.   The server kept coming by and asked us how our food looked? Ummm, it looks fine?  I've never been asked more then once how my food looked. Truth be told, I'm MORE interested in how it tastes! Go figure. haha   I just think she was busy and kept catching us when our food came out.

I got the Fettuccine Rustica and that was delicious, if I wasn't so stuffed I probably would have eaten it all.   Another person in my party had the Shrimp Verduta and they said it was just as good.   The dessert was really small (it came in a shot glass), because it was part of the 3 course deal. But it was really really good.   Overall, a good experience, I would like to come back not during the restaurant week so see how it is different.",

My Hubs & MIL both got the lasagna.  I had the Pasta Alla Vodka and my FIL ordered the Pasta BRIO.    Hubs considers himself a lasagna connoisseur, and he says that the lasagna at Brio is THE BEST in Charlotte (2nd and 3rd place go to Mama Ricotta's and The Open Kitchen).  When asked to describe why Brio is the #1 lasagna in Charlotte he said, \"It's better than the other lasagna's because it incorporates alfredo sauce in addition to the red sauce.  I also believe that it's not sliced out of a large pan but built to order with fresh pasta.  It's also very meaty.  Can't be beat.\"  My FIL took a bite of the lasagna and said, \"That's the best thing I've ever eaten.\" :-)  I'm also convinced that my pasta alla vodka was made to order with fresh pasta and it was phenomenal.  If you're looking for a great italian meal in CLT you have to try Brio - and I highly recommend reservations, there was a big crowd on Saturday night.",

Since moving, I've visited this location three times and it does not disappoint. This location has a larger dining room and bar area than the one that I was accustomed to. And since the VA one was in a mall, it lacked the outdoor seating that this one has. Which is a definite plus!  The food here is terrific. I'm a fan of their pastas. Good portions, nice flavor. Good stuff.  We also had the chocolate molten lava cake. I must say, it was delicious.   Service was fast and attentive. Our meal was out pretty quick. Our waitress was especially warm and personable and gave her share of suggestions.   Price isn't bad. Definitely a nice place to take a special someone to dinner. The bar area is cool too. And apparently they have appetizer specials in the bar area on weeknights.  Definitely worth checking out!",

Likewise, the carpaccio is always fantastic, with just enough seasoning, but not so much that it's over powering. Their wine list is pretty good, and I actually think their house Sauvignon Blanc is on par with more expensive wines. The service is always reliably good, regardless of how busy the restaurant is. The only major draw back to Brio, in my opinion, is they don't have any draft beers or local beers - the lack of draft and locals knocks one star off the review, because that's a big let-down for my BF when we go for dinner. Otherwise, A+",

The chicken parm was probably the best I have ever had. The chicken was lightly breaded and fried and not that thick heavy burnt stuff most other places serve. The red tomato sauce was extremely fresh and light with a lot of flavor and was served with angel hair pasta which I loved. My husband had the pasta Brio which looks like a thick vodka sauce, but it was actually a light pepper cream sauce and was very tasty. This meal was delicious and did not disappoint. The best part is that we didn't feel that heavy sick feeling afterwards which often accompanies Italian food and pasta.",

The atmosphere is very pleasant, there's a bit of mood lighting (though enough to see your food), and the main dining room was on the verge of filling up. The wait staff was ever so kind! The waiter I had (though with my fish memory cannot remember her name) was energetic and super sweet. She seemed to be actually enjoying her job, which is good, because if the waiter seems easily bugged, I tend to take it personally.  To start off, we ordered the spinach and asparagus dip as an appetizer. I was shocked when the waitress came out with flatbread, rolls, and butter, but then I realized that it was the typical bread that came with every meal. Shortly after, the giant bowl of dip came out. It was so good! It came with flatbread rather than chips, which gave the restaurant even more character than it had gained itself previously. And then came the entrees.  I command you to get the portobello raviolli. It is well balanced, the cream sauce it comes drowned in is above par, and even a picky person like me couldn't stop eating it. I ate until I absolutely couldn't stuff in another bite. But apparently I could, because we got dessert.  If you ask them for the options, they will bring out samples. You can't taste them, but our waitress describes them so vividly that we almost could. We decided on the chocolate lava cake that came with vanilla ice cream, and it was really impressive. Practically gourmet quality. The bill came out fast and we were on our way with no mistakes on the tab.   Therefore, that is why I recommend Brio to all people who have thy mouth.",

    "text": "Nice interior and fair service but high prices and really iffy food. I firmly believe that the quality of Italian staples (i.e. spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, etc.) are one of the absolute best ways to judge the overall worth of an Italian restaurant. If those key dishes are not on point it's all downhill from there. I ordered the lasagna at Brio this evening and truly cannot remember disliking a serving of lasagna this much in a very long time. My husband tasted the leftovers that I brought home and we both agree that it was actually pretty terrible. The noodles were way overcooked...soggy/mushy. It came in a weird white creamy Alfredo type sauce. I had to request red sauce to pour over it in an attempt to salvage it (failed attempt). Honestly, if you're going to serve bizarro white lasagna could you please put a warning label on the menu so that diners can adjust their expectations appropriately? The meat was totally lackluster, blah...verging on flavorless. Not sure what I just spent $40 on because I left feeling unfulfilled and have a vaguely unpleasant feeling in my stomach. The dish didn't sit well at all. Brio's valet was a total bust as well. I used valet to save time and that totally backfired as I came out to a long line and wasted about 15 min. waiting around while the two valet attendants took their time getting cars for an entire office holiday party who happened to walk out before I did. The whole operation was inefficient and unprofessional. Overall, a very disappointing outing at Brio...not looking to revisit any time soon.",

    "text": "Went here for my mom's birthday dinner with some extended family. It was eight of us on a Saturday night. We arrived at the restaurant where they have complimentary valet parking. Nice. We were seated immediately (we had a reservation) and two waitresses came to take drink orders. Both of them served us the rest of the night. Much easier than just having one person serve eight of us. We ordered some appetizers for the table including bruschetta and spinach/artichoke dip. The bruschetta was okay, the bread could have been more crunchy. The artichoke dip was pretty good. The bread, though. Man, that bread was superb. Crunchy on the outside, hot on the inside. The crisps they served were excellent as well. After filling up on appetizers, we still had two courses to go.  My main course was steak medallions coated in artichoke. They were pretty good--soft and tasty, but I was so full from the appetizers that I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. Oh well. Still good. For dessert, I ended up with the molten lava cake. They nailed it. 10/10. Fantastic, everyone should order like eight of them. Sublime.  Service was good. Not great, but good. It was quick and courteous, but it lacked a personal touch. Ambience was very nice as well--nice tuscan decorations and some nice (live?) music playing. I'd definitely come back--thumbs up for Brio!",

I know things happen but it's quite annoying to start things off! I hope this isn't a sign of things to come when we're eventually seated! Three trips to the reservation stand and we were finally seated 50 minutes late! Now for a food review...don't get the chopped salad---not fresh tasting and too much dressing. Others had the wedge salad and enjoyed it. Lamb chops and Gorgonzola Medallions are excellent. Milanese Chicken was average. Overall the experience was not the best and it will be a long time before we come back.",

    "text": "We went to Brio last night to celebrate my birthday.  I had signed up for Brio's email club several months ago and got an email wishing me a happy birthday and offering me a free surf & turf dinner ($30 value!).  Naturally, I couldn't pass that up.  Plus, we had been to Brio before and had an exceptional time.  This time, though, we brought my partner's kids.  I was very impressed with the kids' menu.  It was quite extensive.  There were regular kids' portion size items and then there were bigger portion options for older kids.  Some were full dinners -- grilled chicken or a pork chop with mashed potatoes and broccoli!  Then there's the create your own pizza where kids can choose three items on top of their humongous-sized pizza (it's literally enough for two meals).    Anyway, enough with the kids' stuff.  I don't order steak out very often, but I have to say that the filet served with my surf & turf dinner was one of THE most amazing pieces of steak I've ever had.  It was so thick, tender, and perfectly cooked and seared.  I savored each and every bite, and there were a lot of them.  The crab & shrimp cake that I was looking forward to was delicious, too, but the filet really overshadowed it, both in size and taste.  Rounding out the meal were roasted veggies and potatoes.  It was just the perfect amount of food so I wouldn't be overstuffed for the birthday cake that was waiting for me at home. :)  My partner ordered the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto, which was prepared with pancetta, roasted chicken and sweet potatoes, grilled asparagus, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and pine nuts.  Our server described it as \"Thanksgiving in a bowl,\" but it was SO much more than that.  I tried a taste of it and it was incredible.  It had so much flavor to it, including hints of wine.  My partner gobbled it right up (pun intended).  I seriously think he could have eaten another bowlful.    Brio may look intimidating, but they're not as formal or pricey as one might expect.  Plus, they have a great, spacious, comfortable bar area, which I hope to experience sometime.",

It was hot, juicy and cooked through and had a great flavor. The Brussel sprouts  had a great flavor but we're only warmed. Although served in a small cast iron skillet they must have sat while waiting on the pork. I told the waitress so she could notify the kitchen. Tiffany was my waitress and was excellent. She notified the kitchen and they wanted to make it right  I told her I ate them just wanted the staff to know for the next guest. They did give me a slice of cheesecake.

Then we noticed the filet that we loved had increased in price by over $15! So, my husband ordered the Pasta ala Vodka which is typically a dish he likes at most places. It was so bland - had no flavor whatsoever. I ordered the chicken milanese which is a dish I typically love. It was bland, dry, no sauce and two small dots of some rubbery version of what I  am guessing was suppose to be mozzarella. I honestly think the chicken was a processed frozen dinner. I substituted the pasta for some pesto potatoes that the waitress recommended and they were 1/2 way cooked and raw inside. We did not complain as it was New Years Eve. We did notice the restaurant was steady but not as busy as the times we had been there in the past. We were so disappointed, and unfortunately, unless they change the menu back and make some big changes in their cooking/flavor/quality, we will never be back. And I am afraid if these changes are not made they will not be around much longer. Charlotte has too many great restaurants to have this kind of average/fair food.",

Happy hour is till 6:30 and again from 9-close. $3.95-$5.95 bar bites?! You can't beat it! They also have select drinks on special including sangria, mojitos and martinis ranging from $4-$6.  They recently updated their bar bites menu with new options. We ordered the 'tots' which were filled with potato, cheese and bacon with a side of spicy ranch (new to the menu-  $3.95) along with the peppered shrimp with eggplant ($5.95). Both dishes were great. I was expecting the tots to be more \"totty\", but they were basically deep fried mashed potatoes balls-however they were still good. The shrimp was awesome-the right proportion of spicy and savory. I highly recommend the shrimp! I wish we ordered more. Both dishes came with 10 pieces each-great for 2 people.   For drinks I had the sangria and my husband had the \"lemonade\". Both were great- no complaints.   Overall we have always had great service, food and drinks at Brio and I highly recommend it for happy hour :)",

Nevertheless, I settled on some mushroom ravioli and traded in appetizers, all of which was palatable but predictably overpriced.  It's a nice location, and there was live jazz on the night I was there, leading me to afford them a generous three-star rating.",

Actually spoke to the manager that commented below, was actually asked if he could use my personal email as a training tool for his management staff. So the valet company blew me off, and this restaurant still doesn't care. Thanks!!!!  Went here for my daughter's sweet 16 this past Saturday. She had reserved a table for 20 and upon arrival was told they had a table of 10 set aside for her. After the hostess was kind enough to extend her seating time ( they only hold a table for 15 minutes which would have been nice to know in advance), she was told the table was cut down to six, then back up to eight. When her party arrived, they were seated at a table for ten, which ended up working out perfectly for them. Everything was delicious, her dad and I enjoyed our meal in the bar area, had wonderful service and delicious food.      It would have been a very special night for us, had I not parked my car with the valet. Upon arriving home, I noticed that the $40 cash I had stashed in my car(how dare I stash emergency money in my own vehicle, I know) was stolen when I parked the car. Upon calling the next day to inform them of what happened, I was basically dismissed, given the phone number of the \"private valet company that they hire but have nothing to do with\" and sent on my way. I wanted them to be aware that their guests were violated during their dining experience. I know it was dumb to leave money in my OWN car, but the real part that gets me was making the extra effort to walk across the roundabout to get cash out to tip them. What a joke. Thank you so much Brio Tuscan Grille, I will forever associate your business and her 16th birthday with your professionalism and concern.",

It must be a cash maker to draw folks into the bar area but personally it was too loud and they weren't that good and heavily detracted from the atmosphere I am accustomed to in the Brios I've dined at. If I want to hear All about that Bass or Rhianna I would turn on a radio not listen to a sub par cover band.   We worked our way thru the bar flies and were seated. We waited about 5 minutes before our waiter came by and introduced himself and took our drink order. We waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to actually bring the drinks and take our appetizer order. At the time the drinks came we asked for 4 glasses of water as well. Literally 15 minutes later our water arrived and our order was taken. Still haven't seen any bread for the table mind you.  Our appetizer, pepperoni, sausage and ricotta Flatbread, arrived and was quite good. Our salads and entrees arrived shortly thereafter. Everyone enjoyed their entree. Mine was spicy which I would have preferred it wasn't but I forgot to mention that when ordering. I honestly attribute that to the long wait before the waiter took our order, I just forgot to tell him because I was getting irked at the extremely slow service. .  I guess my annoyance started to get obvious because as the meal was ending the waiter came by and was apologetic stating there were several parties tonight. Now all of a sudden we were getting attention? Too little too late dude.   I do understand there might have been parties but my dining experience shouldn't have been sullied and suffered.  My dollars are as important as the people having a birthday party. If anything, management should have seen they had parties booked and realized that, along with a Friday night crowd, means bring in extra staff to ensure everyone's experience is super.   Once again, food... 3.5 to 4 stars. Service... well.....ehhh. Avg=2 stars.",

In the interest of bypassing the craziness of wedding planning we decided on a small ceremony and a nice dinner out afterwards. After doing a bit of research we decided on Brio. None of us had ever been before so it was a gamble but it was the best decision we made for our special day.  I came in with the expectation of a dinner and they made our experience feel so special that it could have been a small reception. A beautiful private room was set aside. We had two waiters for 6 people [Gary and Dan were absolutely phenomenal]. They even brought out our cake for us to cut together as the bride and groom.  The food was out of this world. We ordered the calamari, breschetta, and the shrimp and eggplant for an appetizer. The shrimp was wonderful. My husband doesn't even like egg plant and he couldn't get enough. The entrees and drinks were just as great. The steaks were generous and cooked to perfection, the lobster bisque was the best I had ever had, and the pasta was fresh and perfectly balanced. At the end, the GM Robert came over and promised us a free dinner for our 1 year anniversary. It was special from beginning to end. We will be back for our anniversary and many more times before then. Thank you for making our day so memorable!!",

It was the Lobster & Shrimp Ravioli with Crab Insalata.  Very well stuffed ravioli, cooked perfectly!  The crab insalata was some yummy dark greens dressed with a light viniagrette & plenty of yummy chunks of crabmeat.    The tomato sauce really was the best though...very bright, creamy with a slight smoky sweetness.  Chunks of stewed tomatoes throughout (but not stewed down to mush).  I'd definitely recommend this dish.",

I had  the shrimp and grits as my entree and let me tell you the proportions and texture  were perfect! The service was average and the only thing I really didn't like was the fact that you don't get anything on your birthday except a free appetizer for the next time you come.",

Lots of delicious choices from calamari, lobster and shrimp ravioli, risotto, half chicken, lamb chops, the list goes on and on. Service is not quick by any means but food is worth the wait.   Since Brio is a chain they have lots to offer, have good variety of specials, and the restaurant is very well maintained.",

The Meatballs and polenta were great and the sauce on the shrimp Napoli was good but shrimp were bland. We didn't care for the nachos even though the chicken was good but those and the potato skins were our least favorites. Overall good experience and we will definitely give another try!",

    "text": "Brio has always been one of our 'go to' places.  Something has happened. Management change? Short staffed? We went on Mother's Day.  Had a reservation and had to wait maybe 15 minutes after our Rez time... no big deal... But the staff was running at a frenetic pace.  We had a waiter approach our table and say he be back shortly.... then another waiter came in as a sub.  My wife ordered tea.... after the third time asking for it she got it. (20 minutes after being seated).  The neat little crackers and bread?  No crackers but bread (finally) with no butter??   After dinner we want the hot chocolate cake with gelato.... maybe it should be renamed tepid chocolate cake...... not hot at all.... barely warm.   We've always liked Brios but now we'll think twice.  They'll get one more chance, but only one more. Oh.... and another thing..... they should hire a busboy .... the table across (and one across the way) from us sat empty with dirty dishes for 30 minutes.... (people waiting to be seated) And a runner (literally) ran our food out, and all but threw it at us......  I hope they get it back together.",

Being that I work in a restaurant as well I can always tell when a server didn't wanna take care of us. That night, we had two servers that were not happy about taking our party. We ordered our food and then it took an hour and a half to come out. Then, we didn't get out checks till about another 45 mins. Not sure why the kitchen was so slow that night but, I was not happy.",

When she dropped off the check we let her know about the fish to get it comped (which very clearly went almost untouched), and her response was 'we'll see'. Not high end dining.",
