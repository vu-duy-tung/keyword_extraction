I picked this place based on previous reviews claiming that this is the most authentic Greek food place in Charlotte but I can assure you as someone who was born and raised in Greece that the gyros weren't really authentic, on a spit kinda thing. Also the tzatziki sauce tasted run down watery. So overall it was okay for me.  Also I liked that they tried to bring a European kinda feel to this place by putting seating outside but the sidewalk is too small for that and there's people walking by you watching you eat, it seems kind of awkward at first.",

It was a very weird seasoning choice and nothing a Gyro should ever contain. The fries were amazing though. Not worth the $9 quite honestly. I won't go back and I am suprised by the raving reviews. I will go to Greek Isles next time.. that place is the BOMB!",

Right after we ordered I filled up my cup with some freshly brewed ice tea (sweet and unsweet) and by the time I walked outside to claim a table the food was ready. Fortunately they don't have that Gold Peak ( aka gold piss) crap that a lot of restaurants have in Maryland. I love brewed tea.... So we ate outside at one of the tables. There are only about 3-4 tables out front so most people just grab their food and go. Overall, a great place for gyros that is affordable and ready in a snap. I suspect other items on the menu are also tasty but I can only comment on what I ate and it was delicious!",

When I ask for my order, they inform me that they never received it due to a Grubhub error that placed my order for 2 days later. They were already closed and had just cleaned the grill so I thought I was SOL! Nope! I show them a copy of the email and they say that they'll fix my order even though they were already closed. Wow. Wasn't expecting that. However, that was just the tip of the iceberg! The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I ordered a falafel pita with feta --that they piled on to my delight! Everything was so fresh and flavorful! I also ordered the garbanzo bean side salad and baklava. Definitely the best baklava I've ever had. The spices were distinctive, loved that i could REALLY taste the cinnamon and other spices and it was absolutely divine! I have no complaints! They went above and beyond to make me happy.

My boyfriend's favorite is the Lamb&Beef Gyro and it's pretty solid. To me it's all about that taziki sauce, and they make it just just right!   Another plus, basically everything on their menu is a little under $5!!! And service is nice and quick.  The only con but would not stop me from coming back is this restaurant is LITERALLY a hole in the wall, it's tiny.

It had a generous helping of everything though it could've used a little more tzatziki sauce (that's really personal preference though, and I am a bit of a tzatziki fiend, but they used less than most places do without my asking for extra). I'd have to say the highlight of my meal was the chili cheese fries! The fries stayed crispy even though they were doused in chili, and the chili, cheddar, and fries were all fresh and tasty. I'd also have to say the price point here is quite a deal for what you get and how high quality it is. The staff was super friendly, greeted me upon entry, and checked in with me multiple times to make sure I had everything I needed and that the food was to my liking. They did all this in low-key mostly carry-out spot with a few tables and several customers rolling in to pick up their orders! I would've given it a full five stars if they had used higher quality chicken breast, but at this price point what they're doing is understandable. Also, it may simply be that I had one sub-par cube of chicken breast in my particular gyro by chance. I'll update this review as I try their other meats and build up a bigger sample size for their chicken gyro!",

I think they batter them before deep frying them making them crispy, but soft when you bite into them. You must try them! Their salads are also great. My favorite is the gyro salad and they do not skimp on the meat. Their regular gyros (pronounced euro) are huge and everything is made to order.   LVG is also super cheap ($5-$7 on average for a meal) and they give you large portions so you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Hidden gyro restaurant that's basically like one step up from a NYC street cart. Food menu is short and to the point. They get you your food quickly and it is very flavorful. It's out of the way from uptown so I'm guessing most of their business is from the college or apts/condos above it. Not even sure if they have parking because we live close enough to walk. There are street spots out front, but this is basically uptown. Overall, prices and taste are spot on for gyros, so if you're in the mood for something quick and cheap, and aren't trying to experience the full service restaurant experience, this is your place! Thanks guys, see ya next time!",

Thus, it's a great option for lunch... that is, if you want a delicious, satisfying lunch that may or may not cause a food coma in the afternoon.  Ya might want to pick up one of those 2:30pm coffees.  This little place makes delicious lamb gyros and Greek salads at a reasonable price.  The gyro is fresh and juicy and comes with fries in it, which make it all the more delicious!  The side salad is also a good portion and is reasonably priced.  The salad dressing is great as well.  Very little options around Gateway, but this is probably my favorite place out of all of them.",

The gyros were a bit unconventional but VERY good. Definitely worth a revisit. Next time we'll know to order two gyros apiece if we're hungry: they were that good. And we'll know what to order because dropping off the passenger to run in to order is a time saver.",

I love the fact that it is hidden to some extent and the fact that it is small.  After living in NY for several years I learned  to appreciate these types of restaurants/cafes.  The price is right and the portions are perfect!    I ordered the falafel and I like Kabob Grill's better BUT this was a VERY good wrap and I love the fact that it was offered on a wheat pita.  I wish it had hummus or tahini sauce on it but they went a different route.... They put onion, tomato, lettuce and tzatziki on theirs...which was still great!  I didn't try the fries but the people next to me no doubt caught me peeping their plate...the fries looked amazing!!  I should have just asked them for one.  lol!  My friend got the cheeseburger pita wrap, which was unique in and of itself!  He thoroughly enjoyed it!!  He even paid a compliment to the chef after his last bite with a loud belch.  Once again, the people beside us must have thought were were incredibly wack.  But, we enjoyed OUR meals!    The best part of it all was the price.  I appreciate the fact that they serve fresh, tasy grub for a reasonable price.  Hats off to them and I WILL be back!!",

Most of the menu items are Greek-based, and Little Village Grill does Greek very well.  We tried their tasty, fresh lamb and beef gyros, full of meat, tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce.  I even spotted the meat spit behind the cash register where they slice off pieces as needed, so you know it's fresh!    For sides, we tried the Greek potato salad (made with Greek oregano) and the new garbanzo bean salad with feta cheese.  The potato salad was good, but the garbanzo bean salad was definitely the winner of the two.  It had a lot of flavor (I think it's the cheese!) and chock full of bean protein.    We were too full to eat dessert there, too, but we did bring home some yummy, sweet, gooey baklava for later.    Little Village Grill is designed mostly for take-out orders, but they do have some limited seating indoors and out.   Everyone there is SO friendly.  It's fresh Greek fast food at its best!",

After a relatively short wait, we received what can only be described as a near perfect lunch for such a great day. Everything was absolutely delicious and was enhanced by the great customer service.  Next time we're in town this is definitely on our list for a great casual lunch. I highly recommend this great place to enjoy your afternoon with great food.",

This is the go to place for a Greek craving.  I am sure the salads which are highly pictured are delicious as the gyros, but I went the veggie burger route for my first time.  I walked from my job ( Duke Energy Center) to this place, about a 15 minute walk, and it was well worth it, plus the beautiful scenery.    These fries.... Lawd, these fries... are amazing, one of my favorite styles of french fry!  Everything is made fresh!  The black bean burger was pretty dern good as well.  I hate beans, so it's a little weird that I even order black bean burgers and pick out the visible beans (it's a mental thing). BUT, it was really good, and very filling.  Next time I come here, I'm going to get the salad!  I hope the Greek dressing is as good as it looks!",

There's always a line at lunchtime, but don't let that discourage you. They crank out food and it goes quickly. It's a small place with a few tables inside and out front. I typically get my food to go. They also deliver 4-8pm inside the 277 loop.   I love the chicken gyros. The Greek salad with chicken is usually enough for me to divide in half for two meals. I'm not one who normally orders fries as a side, but I do here. They are just plain stupid good. I can also never stop eating them, even if I'm beyond full. The menu is full of burger, sub, and pita options. There's even falafel, if you're into that kind of thing. Last week, I got the lamb burger special (also, yum I hope this becomes a permanent menu item at some point), a chicken gyro, two orders of fries, and two drinks for around $16. Steal.   John and Cindy really put their hearts and soul into this place. LVG just celebrated its 11 year anniversary. Here's to the next 11.",

What's up with throwing in a couple of fries in the gyro. Something different and not common. No doubt about it. They got good fries. Crispy on the outside. Usually order a side of fries with the gyro.   Going to have to try the lamb burger. Saw one of the photos posted by Nikki. Once in a while I gotta change the routine and try something different.  Always, get the meal to go and there will be a line during lunch hours. Now, I call and place an order then go pick up.  This is my go to place for gyros if you in the area.",

As you can tell from the many many 5 star reviews, there really is no need to ponder any further ... get yo @$$ to Little Village and order yoself some noms.   I've been here probably 10 times, and I've only had the same thing. The traditional beef & lamb gyro combo with fries. 10/10 would recommend. They have those delicious breaded style french fries that just hit the spot. AND, the order of fries is huge, easily enough to split between two people. It's somewhere around $7.50 for the combo, which is cheap in my book.   The gyro/greek salad is a fan favorite for my wife, if you're into that sort of healthy thing.",

There is very limited seating inside (6 seats?) with a few tables outside.  Inside is very cramped but they've done a good job of maximizing the space.  There's a very specific rhythm to the way people move from register to fountain drink dispenser, to waiting for your food.    Service is always friendly and fast.  Stop by with any regularity and they know your name and your order.  Prices are very reasonable.  The owner and his wife are awesome and really care about their customers.  The best part is the food.  I typically order the Greek salad with chicken or gyro meat or the chicken gyro.  The gyro meat is super savory and the salads are always really crisp.  The chicken gyro is really tasty with a warm soft pita.   Whenever I have coworkers come from out of town I always take them here for lunch. The only negative thing is that there can be long lines out the door at lunchtime.  I try to stop by right at 12:00 or after 1:00.",

In the past I've had their burgers, subs, and fries. There's no doubt that the burger patties and fries are frozen food service items. Very disappointing. I get that people like this place because its cheap, but the quality isn't much above fast food, if at all.

    "text": "Little Village Grill is on the Trade St side of the Gateway Village parking garage. It's a small place with limited seating at a few outdoor tables. The interior is always immaculate, and the staff is always friendly when not too busy or alternatively efficient during the rush.   While they have good burgers here, I really like the Greek items the best. The gyros are very good, as are the Greek salads. The cheeseburger pitas are another favorite of mine, and they're as good here as they are at that other place that's famous for putting burgers on a pita.  The prices are also very good, maybe only slightly higher than most fast-food places while offering much better quality. I also like that the owners are the primary cooks here. I like supporting local businesses anyway, but especially ones where the owner is working for a living. That kind of hands-on involvement tends to assure that quality and service are maintained at a higher level than most.",

A pretty long menu that has all the typical short order food (burgers, fries, philly steak, etc.) However, if you don't get the pork gyro, then you are missing out on the point of this place.  The lamb/beef gyro is pretty good, but the pork one is amazing.  Flavorful, juicy, tangy....  This place has a couple small tables if you are a couple, but for the vast majority of people it is takeout food.  Don't be afraid of the long line out the door, because they have the food prepared very quickly for doing it all to order.  I don't think I have ever waited for more than 5 mins.  Prices are pretty cheap for what you are getting, but I guess if you don't have to have a dining room you can keep the prices low.  It would be a 5 star for me if they did have a dining room, but the food is most def a 5.",

To my surprise this was not restaurant quality at all. So the tomatoes were chunked huge, iceberg lettuce only, and no cucumbers the epitome of Greek salad. To top it off the container was half empty. I called to complain but the manager said he needed to see the poorly made salad to remake it. Well he can watch it on Yelp. He was rude, and hung up quickly right after I voiced they lost a patron. If you like to be treated with decency and your food. Then this is not a place for you. The gyro was still tasty.",

    "text": "The staff here is always really friendly.   - Fries (as if they pump air in them before they hit the fryer) the crunch you hear when you bite into them. They have the best fries in Charlotte.  - The Little Village sub is one of my go-to items as the flavor is top notch. Try to eat it there is possible or within 30 minutes, they add a bit of vinegar that adds to the flavor but can also cause your sandwich to go a bit limp if left un-wrapped for an extended period of time.  - Try the cheese steak! Ma, where's the grease? Because it's not to be found on this sandwich. So good and paired best with the fries.   - Coleslaw is really good, not too sweet, has a nice bite and if you want to change things up a bit, put a bit on your sub (man, that's what's \"sub\"!)  - Double Cheeseburger Pita, makes you happy you went with 2 patties over 1!   - Sweet Tea the way it should be presented to anyone trying sweet tea for the 1st time. It's not watered down, has a nice tea taste and I challenge you not to top off before you leave! So good that it needs to sold by the gallon!  - I didn't want to lead with this since everyone seems to leave a review about it (and they should because it's really good!)The lamb and beef gyro! Suprise, you may find a fry or a few in your gyro which add a nice bite to the protein it's wrapped around!   I can go on and on about the other items but I am sure most read just a few lines and went to the next review.   Cliffnote Version: Little Village Grill is small, seating for around 8 inside and if it's nice out, another 8 outside. Lines move fast so if it's out the door, just know that the counter is about 6 feet from the front of the door so it may only be about a 5-7 minute wait. The staff is super busy but they greet you with a smile and the front counter never rushes you as you glance at the menu for any additional items you may want to stock up on at the office for another meal or round two for dinner or lunch the next day! The quality and flavors are great, prices are perfect, customer service is friendly, yeah... this place is a WINNER whenever you are looking for a bite!   Enjoy your 1st, next, many continuous trips to Little Village Grill!",

It's tucked away in a small takeout location off of trade street, there are a couple of tables in front and 2-3 tiny ones inside but, very cramped. Who cares.. The food is worth it! I ordered the falafel pita while the bf got his usual chicken gyro with a side of fries. The best part: the amazingly affordable price. My falafel wrap wasn't even 5 bucks... Bravo! Food came out quick and hot. All the veggies were fresh. The falafel was a little soggy but, flavorful. The tzaziki is a good call here. I couldn't finish and had to take half back. The fries are so crunchy delicious!   They are open till 8p on the weekdays.. This will be my new I'm-too-lazy-to-cook place if I can remember before they close! This place is a must try in Charlotte! Cheers!",

    "text": "I cannot believe it has taken so long to write a review for this wonderful little place. This was the first place we ordered from when we were unloading the moving truck. This place looks tiny, but you can smell the food from down the block. I'm glad it's small because the savings are passed along. First, I couldn't believe the prices. Second, I would have and have paid more for food that fresh and so good. The gyros taste better than anywhere else I've had them. Even their chicken gyro, which I must admit I was skeptical of chicken, is delicious. I've had just about everything. I love their club sandwich and fries, no, I'm addicted to them. I swear I've gained 10lbs moving to Charlotte because their food is fresh, the staff are happy and so nice and this place really is a gem. They even have a vegan Greek dressing that was not only great (I am dubious of vegan), but it also creamy! My picky kids love it too. The staff is so funny my boy is \"pink lemonade\" to them and they start the orders. OH, THE BALAVA! I didn't even know baklava was supposed to crunch because everyone I've had is soggy. I love baklava, now I know what it is supposed to taste like and I'm completely spoiled.  THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC!",

Their fries are awesome as well, and way super addictive with the seasoning. The staff is great, I think some are students but they are so nice, and remember faces.

Its menu isn't exactly extensive, either, but if you're in the mood for some quick food that doesnt taste cheap or unhealthy, or if you're looking to save up some cash for a fancier night out, LV Grill is the place to head. I always go with the Gyro; it's always perfect. The cheesburger pita is actually really good, too, but if you're picking up dinner, definitely stay with the easy Greek stuff. Good falafel, good gyros, good chicken wraps. All come with french fries, which isn't exactly authentic, but pretty tasty nonetheless.   There's only a table or two inside, so don't plan on eating at the Grill. It's a strictly pick-up spot as far as I'm concerned. Again, though, it gets the job done when you're hungry. Grab a drink after you're done at the bar next door...",

I ordered the Grilled Chicken Gyros and added Feta and omitted the onions (had to work).   I took it out, walked about 5 minutes before I ate it.   It was delicious, however my suggestion to the place would be to make sure it's HOT.  The pita was cool to touch, chicken also somewhat warm, not really the nice hot fresh sandwich I would expect.   Overall, however, I would go back, I would just tell them to make sure it's nice and hot!   Everything that's added is cool (tomato, feta, etc..so it has to be hot to start) Great inexpensive lunch! I highly recommend for a tasty lunch bite!    BTW you can never go wrong adding feta to a chicken gyro, especially if there isn't enough tzatziki sauce!",

There's a ton of construction so getting there is harder than usual, but we just parked in the parking garage attached to the building. You can only get into the garage on the back side of the block right now.   It's definitely a take out place, but we decided to eat there at the couple of tables they have. Orders come out fast. We probably waited about 5 minutes for ours.   We got a traditional gyro as well as a falafel pita. Then we got a side of regular fries and chili cheese fries with baklava for dessert. The gyros were delicious. I liked the traditional more than the falafel (the falafel wasn't quite as flavorful or crispy as I like). I would say it was the one of the best gyros I've had. The fries are also amazing. I preferred the regular ones - they didn't need the chili. Likewise, the baklava was delicious.   You definitely can't beat the price. We got a ton of food and it was all about $15.   I would highly recommend checking this place out for some great, cheap, quick food!",

Little Village is one of them. This place deserves its 5 star rating. They have one of the best Philly cheesesteaks I have ever had. Mind you, I have never been to Philadelphia, so don't hit me with the comparison to those from its state of origin. However, as far as Charlotte goes, their's is good. They have good steak fries as well.  My wife always goes for the Gyro. The lamb is superb. The meal is always affordable and the value is great. The staff are always nice and you can tell, they take pride in what they do.  The dining area is small.  However, for the quality, value and experience, you won't mind taking it home or being a little cramped.",

Then I got on foot to walk along construction.  It was a super tiny restaurant with enough space to order, sit, use the bathroom which is also a locker for employees.  I ordered a lamb & beef gyro with everything on it (w/ feta).  I got a combo with fries and sweet tea. It came to $9 which is about right.  They have the \"square\" payment service.  I didn't have any lettuce on my sandwich.  I didn't notice at first but a few fries were in my sandwich.  I see it's \"a thing\" they do.  The sandwich was tasty but nothing super.  The tea was on point.",

    "text": "When I was a Smalltown Boy, I used to wish I was a Little Village Girl. I still do, to some extent, and am already planning out the according surgery. But that's beside the point. I thought there would never be any kind of Grill that would compare to the thought of me being a Little Village Girl. But the Little Village Grill is as exciting as me being a Little Village Girl. And that's the greatest compliment I can give to a Gyro, other than asking it to marry me. I haven't proposed to this Gyro yet, but that's only because he seems to be a little preoccupied with some thot named Charlotte.  What to get: A Gyro What not to get: Stung by a WASP  There's nothing little about my village grill, if you know what I mean. But that's another story for another day. Or later tonight at least.  I was never much of a fan of food in Charlotte North Carolina - and that has changed a little bit with my last few trips there - and I'm glad I found a truly excellent Gyro in this area. The service here is lovely and the prices are fair. Most importantly the Gyro is absolutely delicious.  Plus I think the boy here has a crush on me. He was giving me the eye. Why does everybody think that I like boys? I mean I do but why does everybody think that?  Hi boys.  Anyway I consider myself a bit of a Gyro expert and I can spot a bad girl... I mean a bad Gyro... or a mediocre gyro or a good one, a mile away - more than most people. And this is definitely one of the better ones I've had anywhere, and easily the best one I've tried in Carolina, so get over here and enjoy a gyro that would not be out of place in shy town or the large pear. I mean Chicago or the Big Apple.  If they end up on the food network, as they should be, then I guess it'll be Grills On Film... Grills On Film.",

We got a double cheeseburger, 4 servings of fries (delicious, crispy but not too greasy), tzatziki sauce for the fries, and some gyro with lamb I believe. The gyro was phenomenal, texture was soft, flavors were combined well. Me and my brother can both eat a lot and we had hard time finishing (it was 3 of us, not just 2), which is a good sign when combined with good service, swift preparation, clean bathrooms (props for that), and tasty and good food. Prices are spot on. Definitely recommended.  One tip, though. During a sunny day, it's not the best idea to leave the condiments sitting outside on the tables. From a consumer perspective - no thanks, I don't know how long it's been sitting there, not even mentioning the possible health hazzard of sun frying some of the ketchup or mustard bottles.",

I believe I have had every single item on their menu and I have not been disappointed by any of them. I would say my favorites are the pork gyros, chicken sandwich and cheeseburger. However, the also make a great BLT and hot dog. And I always buy a brownie when they have them. They're fudgy, delicious and only $1.25  2. The service is super friendly and fast. There's always a line. Always. But the line is a sign of good food according to most food critics. Better yet. The line moves fast. Have your order ready when you get to the counter because they want to move you along. However, you'll never feel rushed because they're so friendly and helpful.   3. Prices are unreal. There are several times I have to stop and ask to make sure they got my complete order. And they always do, but it's just so shocking how inexpensive they are for what you get. You can honestly get out of there with a cheeseburger, fries, drink and brownie for under $10. There have been many times that I spend $5-6 without a drink and we are talking about a lot of tasty food. Not fast food.   It's a to go place with only a handful of tables so plan on eating elsewhere. There's a huge office campus a 1/2 block away with a hundred lunch tables and chairs. Or take it to your office or a nearby park for a picnic. Anyway you get it you will not be disappointed.",

The spices are great and they even add a \"few fries\" to the gyro for what we'll call differentiation. None-the-less, a nice surprise.  The Chicken Gyro with a Greek Side Salad is my classic go-to. Preparation and flavor is always consistent so I always know what I'm going to get.

The sauce is super flavorful, and their onions will knock you down with the flavor.  So much food, and the price is very reasonable.  Other Yelpers make me want to try the rest of their menu, and I probably will, eventually.  The only downside is that the place is tiny.  Literally 3 2-tops inside, and 2 umbrella-shaded 2-tops outside.   I'll keep trying new gyro places, but every 2nd or 3rd time I have a craving, Little Village will satisfy it for me.",

I had a great gyro and it had french fries in it! Overall, the food tasted great, not too heavy (i.e. greasy) and not too messy (no shirt stains). I may want to go light on the onions next time but will definitely eat there again.  Can't locate a website or menu.

I gave them a 4 star because the sub was just ok. The oil and vinegar was really good but the meat isn't really seasoned, so you really need some sort of seasoning on it. I will definitely return to try some other items. I'm definitely a fan!!",

I've only had the gyros & Greek salad here but other food looks good as well. Taziki sauce is very garlicky (which I like) so don't forget gum/mints.  It's more of a grab & go place - seats are very limited. Staff is friendly & upbeat, ingredients are fresh & prices are fair! Line is out the door during lunch hour but it moves fast & there's not that long of a wait once order is placed. Also from listening to them call out their orders - I've learned I've been been pronouncing gyro's wrong all these years",

They are so efficient and can work in sync to get everyones food out in a timely manner.   They do not offer parking, so you will need to park on the street or a nearby lot.   What I've had:   Greek Salad with Chicken: Love this salad! They use Romaine and not ice-burg which I like. Their chicken is tender and nicely marinated.  Black Bean Burger - Fantastically seasoned and super tasty! This one takes a while to cook, so don't order if you're in a hurry.   Gyros - I've had the lamb, chicken, and pork. I enjoy the lamb and pork one because they throw a couple fries inside. Their to tzatziki sauce is very good!   If you want a side go with their Greek pasta salad.  Seating is limited, approx 3 tables for 2 people inside, three tables for 4 outside.   Their prices are also extremely affordable!",

Its cooked to order, with very cheap prices, and the option to add a drink and fries for a dollar or two extra. The portion of the food is definitely enough to fill me, and I can be pretty stuffed if I get the fries as well. This place definitely offer great value for the price you pay and the quality of food you recieve. A few down sides, very limited sitting, inside the small restaurant, there was only about 6-8 seats, they also have outside seating I believe, but that won't be very helpful during the colder months. They also unfortunately charge an extra 75 cents for tzatziki sauce which is a nuisance not knowing that at the counter and having to dig for change on my way back. However, I definitely think that this is a great affordable lunch spot in Charlotte, but more tailored for on the go / take out type restaurant. Either way dine in or dine out, I would highly recommend this place!",

But it's clean and the employees there are very friendly.  The food comes out quick and it's delicious. There's a good selection too! burgers, subs, salads, gyros and good sides too. pasta salad, slaw, fries...I had the little village sub and a side order of pasta salad and a soda. The sub was fantastic. It's kind of like their take on a cheesesteak. My friend ordered the gyro (which seems like the most popular lunch item), fries and a drink. He enjoyed his too. The best thing about our meals were that they were delicious, they came out fast, the portions were pretty generous too. (I posted a pic of my meal) AND my meal was under $10.  It's not the place to go if you want to sit and catch up with friends and have a long conversation-filled lunch. But if you're hungry and are looking for a quick, delicious meal to go with fast food prices, here's your place. I'd definitely go there again in a heartbeat!",

We usually order the gyro and chicken pita, very very delicious!  Parking is tough due to construction and limited street parking,  line sometimes long but their service is pretty quickly.  It is sooo worth the wait!",

You order and then wait for them to call your number.  I took it Togo to eat at the Johnston & Wales courtyard.    I ordered the chicken gyro and my husband ordered the regular gyro, with a side of fries and potato salad.  The reason I am giving them 4 instead of 5 is that there was barely any chicken on my chicken gyro and it was disappointing because I could tell it would be good.  Everything else was great and the prices are pretty good too. I will try them again!",

I typically avoid Gyro meat because it's super salty but I needed a quick meal and this place drew me in because they have the option of having a whole wheat wrap so I got the gyro and much to my dismay it's not noticeably salty at all and has amazing flavor.  I got a salad in addition and the chicken on the salad is so tender and flavorful and that it almost didn't even need the dressing definitely will be returning on my next Charlotte visit.",

Fries were good, but I recommend adding the seasoned salt to get a bit more flavor. This is a very popular lunch spot, but don't let the long line deter you. They move through the line quickly and the cash register is right by the door, so a \"line going out the door\" might only mean two or three ahead of you. That's probably my only complaint - the menu is inside but you can't really see it until you're ordering, which can hold up the line if you don't know what to order.",

I use to get the Little Village Sub with steak, provolone, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, oil and vinegar but lately I've been hooked on the Pork Gyro with a side of fries drowning in greek dressing :)  Ella bounces between the Grilled Chicken Gyro and a side of fries or the Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken. We've never had a bad experience at Little Village Grill and judging from the constant line out the front door I thinks its safe to say its a local favorite.  Check them out today and let us know what you think.",

The French fries are AWESOME...very crispy on the outside, but somewhat soft on the inside.  I placed an order to go.... I ordered the chicken Gyro w/ the side of fries & a soda.  The chicken was seasoned nicely...lettuce, tomato, onion and tzatziki was standard... not the best Gyro, but not the worst either.   The entire meal was $7 bucks so you can't beat the price. Staff was very friendly. The place is small but they do have some tables if you decide to eat there. I will definitely try this place again and make sure that I eat there.   When I do, I will make sure to submit an updated review.",
