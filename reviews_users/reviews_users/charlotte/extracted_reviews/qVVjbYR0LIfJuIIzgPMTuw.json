They do always go out of their way to get it right.  Two can't miss menu items are the lobster-spinach queso and the Firebirds Chicken Pasta. Both are winners and usually my go-to selections.  Desert is a tad overpriced but if you sign up for their e-club you'll get $10 off your bill anyway, so go ahead and splurge. The creme brulee is UH-MAZING.   Firebirds is definitely worth a shot!",

The signature martini (made with pineapple infused vodka), was fabulous.  I had the sesame encrusted salmon, which was cooked to perfection.  The spinach salad was delicious.  However, I am not a fan of the fried spinach which was served with my entree.    One member of my party did not care for his dish.  The manager came over right away and offered him another option or a credit for his meal.  He declined both, because he felt that the preparation was right, he just didn't like it. Besides he was enjoying my salmon and mashed potatoes!  He then ordered dessert, Key Lime pie which was excellent and even better, free.  I have never had a bad meal at this establishment and the wait staff is always attentive and courteous.",

He started off by discussing how ready he was to get off work so he could go out and party. To make things worse, he then rushes us through our drinks and dessert. He dropped off our check while we were still finishing dessert and we never saw him again.  Unfortunately, I have had poor service at the bar too on separate occasions.",

This year we returned to celebrate a birthday.  First of all the food was outstanding, the lobster queso amazing,  the prime rib the best I've ever tested , the carrot cake awesome.  So food was great but this time a couple of glitches with the service.  1. Ten minutes after we were seated before our server arrived. 2. Turn down the volume of the background music please. Place is already noisy enough with folks conversation.  3.  Our main course was served to us 5 seconds after our salads arrived.  A big big no no.

    "text": "I've walked by this place a half dozen times and have never given it a second glance.  The only reason we stopped in this time was that it was Christmas Eve and the flu is running rampant in the Charlotte area and when I gazed into the food court it quickly transformed into a hipster night club where all the famous germs hang out.  Long lines with big germ bouncers while inside the all the who's who of Germville were drinking, dancing, and putting the moves on each other!  We immediately looked for a cleaner and climate controlled safer environment in which to dine.  We opted for the Fireside.  Not much to say.  The menu is limited and nothing spectacular and is somewhat pricey for what you get.  My daughter had the portabella burger and I had the parmesan crusted Mahi.  My Mahi was fresh and well cook but lacked any real flavors.  My daughter seemed to enjoy her portabella which was well put together.  Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable and provided us with fairly quick service.   Probably won't return to a firebirds, just don't think it is worth the money.  I believe there is way better food out there in that price range or less.  On the up side; we did get our valet ticket validated.  $5.00 is $5.00!",

    "text": "I went to this location during lunch.  The food itself is pretty good,  not outstanding by any means but just solid, good food. I had the ribs, coconut shrimp, and crab cakes.  Ribs were a little burnt,  but everything tasted fine. I would have to say,  although very small the crab cakes were the best of the three.  For a mall restaurant, I love the interior. It was very warm and inviting...kinda reminds me of Bone Fish Grill's scheme on design. The only thing that bothered me was the lunch service.  I've been there during dinner and it was always great.  This experience left much to be desired.   So my aunt flew in from out of town,  it was last minute and she wanted to have lunch and go shopping. It was also her birthday.  We decided to go to Northlake Mall because it was close to my house. Before she came over from the airport.  I called ahead and made reservations and even dropped off a cake at the restaurant before I  picked her up from Charlotte Douglas. I wanted to suprise her. The waiter was sweet but he looked lost and unorganized, he may need more training. Our water would remain empty for long periods without being refilled,  when food came it took forever to hunt him down for simple condiments such as ketchup for our fries,  and to top it off....when he dropped off the \"suprise\" cake,  he just left it on the table with 4 plates and left. How the heck do I cut the cake with no knife? Oh yeah how do we eat the cake with no forks? He forgot that too! SMH.....we had to flag down another waiter for what we needed. Took over 10min!!!!  He is lucky he had me as a customer because I was once a waitress in college so I was more understanding that sometimes you can have a bad day at work.  But I don't think I will be back anytime soon,  I was embarrassed that my Aunt had to sit through that experience.",

Even the waitress remarked more than once before our food came that there was some kind of problem. Each of us got the mixed seasonal vegetables. The broccoli was discolored and very overcooked, the cauliflower, peas and carrots won the championship for bad food. They were right out of the freezer and NOT COOKED AT ALL. Super weird. Talked to the manager because it was that weird. Wish I had taken a picture of her face, that would explain everything to the world. Maybe they should keep some canned soup on hand and hand it to customers and then they would be a thousand times better off.",

    "text": "Came here with my coworkers during lunch and was pretty disappointed. First off, I've heard from friends and colleagues that Firebirds is pretty fancy which is why it took so long for me to eat here so I did have high expectations.   Service was great for our party of 6. I had no complaints on that end. I'm not sure what the party size for gratuity is but we weren't charged so we all tipped well since the service made the lunch.   I ordered a burger thinking that it cannot be messed up. The burger was a little more firm than I prefer. It also wasn't juicy at all. It had the appearance of being handmade but tasted like it was shipped frozen. Also, the buns were stale. My coworker ordered a chicken sandwich of some sort and got her bun switched out. When she received her new sandwich, they literally put chicken on a warmed bun and took it back out. She was missing all her toppings like cheese, sauce, etc. I didn't want to even bother switching mine out at that point. Another coworker ordered the shrimp tacos and raved about it. The other coworkers ate but didn't comment on the food- guess it wasn't anything special.  If I do return, I plan to get a drink at the bar. They looked really good.",

I spent 30 dollars last night for lettuce. If you are not looking for lighter choices then everything is just delicious and perfectly proportioned for the price. AGAIN, do not waste your time on the salads you will regret it. Service and atmosphere was great. Only gave one star because of the over priced lettuce.",

    "text": "\"Proper\"  That's the first word that comes to mind when reflecting on my experience here last night.  Mainly, that's the first word that comes to mind because that is how Jordan (one of my co-workers) would describe the steak that I ate.  It was most certainly a proper ribeye in every sense of the word.  I rolled in late (as in 40-minutes before closing late) with a group of classmates and we were all hungry and thirsty.  The kind of hungry and thirsty you can only get from a nice, drawn-out corporate training group project that you work on in a hotel lobby from the time your class ends until about 9pm.  Yep, the situation definitely called for a nice expense account ribeye!  My steak was ordered medium rare and arrived exactly medium rare.  From the first bite to the last, I was struck by the incredible wood-fired grill flavor imbued in the meat.  Every single bite had that delicious smokiness!  The meat itself was middle of the road but that was to be expected given the price point.  The smokiness was what carried the day!  My steak came with their loaded baked potato (also good) and a piece of key lime pie.  Actually, it wasn't described that way on the menu but I decided it was a simple editorial error and asked the waiter to make it right.",

Very large disappointment tonight that although the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived for an early dinner (5:30), we were seated in the very back next to the open kitchen. Our celebratory, special meal/evening out (new job) was not enjoyable at all. The entire meal was listening to the constant loud clanging of the silver food pans and the employees yelling orders and commands at each other.  Not my idea of a pleasant experience whatsoever. Ruined the night and the expensive meal. The hostess tried to seat a couple right next to us and they immediately recognized the unpleasant atmosphere and asked to be seated somewhere else. The hostess made an unprofessional facial expression but sat them elsewhere. I wish I had asked to be reseated. Too expensive and too special of an evening to be seating patrons next to the dishes and pots/pans banging unless you are busy and at seating capacity.",

I wouldn't have ordered the Tenderloin trio appetizer if I knew I was getting steak but trying the different ways they prepare their meat was a great way to decide once you get the full menu. Cassie makes an incredible Cosmo & is so attentive I felt like we were the only ones at the crowded bar. Christian is a great conversationalist all while hustling out drinks all around the bar.

Not a great value for the money.  -my boyfriend initially ordered the macaroni and cheese and it was gross. The waitress happily exchanged it for mashed potatoes, which ended up turning out well (see above)  Best steak place in Charlotte? I ain't saying all that. But a good spot? Yep.

Anyways, I ordered the cilantro grilled chicken breast with Parmesan mashed potatoes--absolutely delightful. It came with some sort of mild chipotle or orange sauce on the plate, but whatever it was, I want to put that stuff on everything.

    "text": "Kudos to management. Visited Firebirds last night (Wednesday), which is one of their busier afternoons. I was sitting in the bar area near where servers picks up drinks. My guest and I were behind about 6 waiters and no one had bothered speaking to us. The manager saw this, came over immediately, and asked whether we had been helped and what drinks we would like to get us started. He then introduced us to our waiter who was standing right there already and went about his merrily way. This was excellent management, addressing a problem before it became one.  Afterwards, I ordered the chicken quesadilla. As a whole, it exceeded expectations and was very flavorful. However, the chicken in it was bland and definitely not wood fire grilled. If they prepared the chicken like it was going to be eaten alone and added more seasoning, they would have a perfect dish. Nevertheless, I recommend you order this. It could suffice as a meal alone.",

    "text": "I would love to give you a better rating, because I liked the waiter. Not for his service, but because of his personality. First of all. If you are going to place hostesses in the front to greet patrons, please make sure they are efficient. My family and I visited Firebirds Northlake because of Father's day. We made reservations to ensure we would get a table since it was Father's day. There were approx. 3 very young ladies seating the patrons. One hostess proceeded to seat us but we told her we wanted a booth, so we returned to the front of the restaurant while that hostess went to ensure a booth was being prepared for us. About 2 minutes later, a second hostess proceeds to take us to a table and we told THAT hostess we asked for a booth! Please communicate between all of you!!  Next, I am dieting and I track everything I eat. I went on Firebirds website and found their nutritional page. I made my selections beforehand, as to what I would be ordering. On their website was an entree called Citrus Grilled Chicken; perfect! I pre-tracked this entree. When we got to our booth to order our food, I looked at the menu and Citrus Grilled Chicken was nowhere on the menu. I asked our waiter if they still offered this chicken dish and he said no. I told him it was on THIER website. He spoke with the manager and was told it is NOW being called Pineapple Chicken. Okay, no worries, but why is the information not updated on YOUR website.  The manager came to our table and told me a lot of times when they change their menus in the restaurant, they are not immediately updated on their websites!! WHY!! It should be.  The Pineapple chicken dish was  . . . . okay. Nothing spectacular!!  My husband ordered their French Dip Sliders and couldn't eat all of them, so he took some of his meal home. He asked the server for a to-go box and a cup to put the au jus in. The first cup he brought him had a bug in it!!!!! REALLY!!  Finally, the prices are WAY TO HIGH for the quality of food and the service!!!!! This is our last time at Firebirds! No wonder there were empty seats.  One more thing!! Waiter service was bad. Our server was forgetful. I could see if it was terribly busy, but it was not!!",

    "text": "We chose this spot to have our first anniversary dinner, probably not really thinking about the crowds that would be at the mall for the the day after Christmas Shopping...other than having a little more wait time than we were expecting on a Wednesday night, this visit was very good.  I think our waitress' name was Ashley...I've got to start writing it down when we have great service!  We had the Ranch Rings for an appetizer and they were good enough, but definitely not my favorite by far, and the sauce was not complimentary to the rings in my humble opinion.  I chose the chicken pasta for my entree and it was delicious and more than plenty to enjoy that night, plus lunch leftovers later!  The sauce was rich, but not overly so and the hint of bacon was a nice touch.  My husband had the Aspen Sirloin and said it was your basic steak, probably nothing overwhelmingly \"wow\" about it, but still tasty and it was cooked perfectly to his liking.  Because we had dessert at home, we opted for none this trip, though we did see several coming out that looked yummy.  All in all it was a great visit, mainly due to the great service we had, never an empty glass, attentive group effort to make sure everything was okay and two decent menu options.  We'll probably be back in the near future...it seems to be on the somewhat regular rotation in our circle of friends right now!",

Firebirds is the one place where I always, ALWAYS order a drink. And it's usually the same drink: the black diamond martini. It's a pineapple martini and is made by soaking wedges of fresh pineapple in vodka for like 7 days. This is my favorite drink of all time.   For my entree I went with my all time favorite: the wood grilled salmon, Parmesan mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables. The salmon is so delicious. It was a huge, thick piece of salmon with absolutely fantastic flavor.   Graham had one of their specials, a Santa Fe style pasta. It had shrimp, chorizo and scallops in a chardonnay cream sauce. This was exceptional. Chain restaurants usually have tiny, sad little scallops. These were huge, and perfectly cooked. I'm a sucker for the dish I ordered, but this was as good as mine.  Everything I've ever had here is very good, the service is always good and I've always had a good dining experience.",

My wife had the chicken pasta which was good and I had the meatloaf which was also good. Nothing stood up and nothing was bad. I'd say it's like an average middle class restaurant. What got them down from a 3 to a 2 star review was the fact that they do not offer on-the-house desserts on bdays. Nor do they chant happy bday. What an unpleasant surprise. Everything else was okay/good though.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and ate both times at the bar.  The bartenders were nice and made sure that my beer was poured quickly.  I can't say that they have a great selection of beers on draft - a Sam's seasonal, a local micro-brew and then a couple of the big boy breweries.    Most recently, I tried the shrimp and filet.  The shrimp are skewered and covered in butter and garlic.  A little too much for me. Also, they were slightly over cooked but not rubbery. I was more disappointed in the filet.  The filet was oddly shaped so it didn't cook evenly.  Medium on some of the edges, mostly medium rare and then some rare parts too.  It was kinda odd.  If it was cut right, I think it would probably have come out better.  Finally, please do not wrap bacon around the filet.  I don't get this. Yes, I love bacon like many people, but let's keep the steak alone.  Seriously, the steak looked like it was wearing a jiggly bacon belt. Not pretty.",

We were greeted by a lovely hostess who asked if we preferred a both or table (which I thought was nice) and then she seated us. We were seated for much too long of a time without anybody speaking to us or asking us for our drink orders, which I was disappointed in... I had heard wonderful things from friends about this place and I didn't want it to leave a bad taste in my mouth. I proceed to having to stop a server to inform her we have been sitting for awhile and nobody had spoken to us, the server was very kind... And took care of everything we needed and more! I ordered a steak and it came out perfectly. Melissa was super sweet and didn't seemed bothered by us letting her know nobody had served us. The server manger came over and apologized, saying there was a mix up... Which is understandable (I've been a server myself before) After the server manager came over, then the actual manager came over and Apologized and bought our dessert. I was very disappointed at first, but the staff was very wonderful and took care of us... That's all I can ask in restaurant... Mistakes happen. Will def be back soon and will ask for Melissa.",

    "text": "Firebirds is a pretty good steakhouse, and while our visit wasn't perfect, it was quite good.  I ordered the sirloin cooked medium rare, and the steak was red and juicy. The steak fries tasted a bit funny, like the cooking staff used too much grease, but they were still pretty good. My father's ribs were really good, though the half rack order only comes with six (generally I believe it's seven or eight for a half rack order). My mother was disappointed her tortilla soup came out cold, but enjoyed it.   The service was quite good; when we had problems with the temperature, the waiter went and got the manager to turn the temperature down. Plus the waiter was a nice kid (save for his tendency to hard sell on the drink/dessert menu just a bit). The ambiance is nice as well;  it's in a mall but hard to tell, and the fireplace is a nice touch. My parents really like this place as an upscale place to spend holidays (like New Year's Eve) and I think it's a pretty good steakhouse as well.",

Was told the wait would be 35-45 minutes which was no problem other then the fact that 4 parties with no reservations where sat before my family. They had the same amount of people so it wasn't that we only had 3 people total. After waiting almost a hour to finally be seated we where told bread was burnt and didn't receive any until after our entrees where almost done. On top of all this the manager at the front of the house was extremely poor at communicating and came off like a pretentious jerk as well as the host that was seating people. So much so out server even apologized and said she saw what happened and was sorry we had to go through that. I ordered the surf and turf and my lobster was extremely tough the rest of the food was decent but this really left a bad taste in my mouth. Not once did a manager come check on us after seeing what we had gone through and still having a 120 dollar tab. I eat at both locations by South Park and by Northlake and after this experience I will try very hard to keep it at the South Park location from here out. Horrible customer service minus our great server.",

Main course was a rib eye steak which was well prepared and not covered in a bbq sauce so it was very enjoyable. The side was the garlic mashed potatoes... they had a nice flavor but weren't creamy.   My wife had the prime rib which she really enjoyed and the kids had the kids steak that they inhaled.  Desert was key lime pie and cheesecake, each was delicious and big enough to share, thank goodness for kids coming with lol. Kids meals came with mini oreo packs.  Waitress was Mary, very nice and attentive, generally had my water glass filled before we had to ask and thought to clear the small plates and bread pallet when our dinner came out(something commonly skipped but the extra room for dinner plates make it so much more enjoyable so it was appreciated.)  Only reason for 4instead of 5stars was the potatoes and the fresh bread had a very flaky crust. So much so that upon cutting it the mess  of flakes and crumbs were everywhere... maybe a differing plate or something but the bread itself was fresh and warm.",

There are separate pricing for 5 oz and 8 oz wines and although we ordered 5 oz, we were charged for 8 oz. when I pointed this out, I was Again was told it was correct only when I insisted, the error was rectified with no apologies.   The food quality was extremely bland as well - Cilantro Grilled Chicken was very stringy and bland along with the Pineapple chicken.  Also we were given a small booth with a chair in the end with limited and cramped space for 5 people to eat..  So overall it was a disastrous experience from poor bland food, rude server to cramped and uncomfortable seating.  Based on this, I would not recommend this restaurant for anyone.",

The staff is always very friendly and professional.  You also get bread before your meal there which is a super bonus for me.  I love bread!  They also ask if you want more bread if you finish it before your meal comes out, which I love to get more bread!  The food is very high quality and fresh here.  The cocktails are very good, I had the margarita and loved it.  The drinks however are a little bit pricy but that pretty standard at a nice restaurant.  The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is that two of the times that I have been to Firebirds, my order has been wrong.  Nothing huge but small stuff like the wrong side item, and cheese on my burger when I ordered no cheese.",

I spent some time with my mom here and due to the 90 minute wait, we decided to grab a seat at the bar. Our server/bartender was Mary and she was really nice and super fast when it came time to make our drinks (after a long week, bartenders like her can become your best friend in 2.5 seconds).   I enjoyed my favorite dish in their menu - Firebirds Chicken Pasta - it comes with thin slivers of chicken and real bacon bits in a spicy cream sauce over penne pasta. If you're indecisive on what to get, you can't go wrong with that. For two people with a few drinks included... $80. Total was not budget friendly, but neither is treating my mother (lol, don't tell her I said that).   The only turn off with this location... is the parking. To save yourself the headache you can always valet park for $5 (don't quote me on the cost), but if you would like to park your own car then you will have to join the scavenger hunt along with the mall goers.

Despite that, I've been here at least five times and I owe them a solid shout-out.  You might be wondering what I've even had here since I've been so many times. Guys. It's the lobster cheese dip. I get it every time I go. And I eat like it IS my MEAL. It's so glorious. I've even gotten two before. I've been known to visit here with my dad and we would gorge ourselves on beer, dip and free bread. Wait, free bread too you say? Yep. Easily one of the best free breads out there for any restaurant. Olive Garden can take a hike!  The service is also stellar. I've only once had a bad experience with the dip - chips were soggy and limp and the dip itself was cold. They comped it AND gave us free desserts for everyone at the table. I mentioned beer above, but wanted to point out they tend to have a pretty good selection of the lesser known ones and local items on tap. If you want to dine here I suggest making reservations ahead of time but if you have a small group they have first-come-first-serve bar seating and high-top seating around the bar.  Last but certainly not least, be warned that there is a price to pay at this fine-dining chain establishment. But frankly, I promise it's worth it.",

I just went for a burger. I'm a simple man, I see a burger, I order it. Easily one of the best burgers I've had. Not over dressed, just cooked perfectly with some smokey cheddar on a perfect toasted brioche bun. Nice char on the outside of the generously portioned patty, insanely juicy inside.  My wife got the chicken pasta which more than hit the spot. Generous portion, a little smokey, a little spicy. So good! She never gets excited about having leftovers but it sounds like she's already got her lunch planned for tomorrow.  The place itself is pretty cool inside, stacks of wood and exposed beams. Dig it!  Our server was great as well. Very attentive and friendly. He stuck around after all of our awkward mayonnaise jokes so he's a good egg in our book.  If you like good food, they make that here. In a mall. Like really good food. We love it and we're definitely coming back!  If nothing else the bread is shaped like a butt which is equally hilarious and delicious.",

I went on a Thursday evening, the place having been chosen by a dear friend who's abandoning me - I mean moving onto bigger and better things :) We met around 5:30 and were immediately seated. I had arrived earlier and noticed that the bar section was a little busy thanks in part to their happy hour promotion that takes place during the week.   We placed our orders for the bacon wrapped 5oz filet mignon (medium); I requested a loaded baked potato and my friend went with fruit as her side. I also had a glass of pinot noir to accompany my meal.  Mouth-watering. juicy. succulent. cooked to perfection. I was completely blown away at how delicious my (our) steaks turned out. I've always had a complicated experience when it comes to ordering steaks at restaurants so I'm usually wary when I see my plate come out. Firebirds went above and beyond in exceeding my expectations. The filet was everything I previously described and more. I am still thinking about that piece of meat (#thatswhatshesaid) now at two days later.  My loaded baked potato - complete with sour cream, cheese, bacon bits, and scallions - was hot and even lightly salted on the potato skin. Everything was delicious. I even commented during my meal that the steak made me feel like it was my first time ever having steak because every other steak I've had largely fails to compare.  I was very tempted to order dessert but my friend stated that it was best to end the meal on a high note and everything on the dessert menu just sounded heavier than what I was in the mood for to indulge.  Bravo Firebirds! I cannot wait to return!",

Ordered grilled salmon on top.  Very disappointing.  Thin piece of salmon, stuck to the skin.  Either dry or not that fresh.

The waitress was super-nice and very attentive, really good service. The only thing I wasn't happy with were the loaded potato skins (they were bland) and she happily let me trade it out for something else.  Although attached to Northlake Mall, you access the restaurant from the outside with lots of easy parking at the mall. Great ambiance and decor, think classy wine country-esque eatery with stacked stone fireplaces, nice wood, gas lanterns, etc. Great for date night or a special occasion.",

I went in to the bar on New Year's Eve, a night you should have your A Team working.  If that was their A Team, they need to quickly restaff and/or hire a new GM.  There were 3 bartenders working, which should have been more than enough for the crowd on hand.  While the bar was full, it was never fully 2 deep.  Between the 3 bartenders, they ran around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Instead of splitting the bar customers between 2 of them and leaving the 3rd bartender for the servers at the service bar, all 3 tried to do everything.  The result?  The bartenders where constantly in each others way, servers and customers consistently waited longer for drinks than they should have, overcharging on my check, and a generally unpleasant experience.  I blame this fully on management for either not properly training their staff, not having a plan in place for NYE, or for not having the proper staff in place to begin with.   Major Fail!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Firebirds at Northlake for dinner. It was crowded when we arrived, so we opted to sit at a table in the bar thinking we would get faster service and be able to keep up with the World Series on the screens. It took a few minutes for our server to approach us, but she was friendly when she did finally greet us. We ordered drinks which then took 20+ minutes to arrive even though we were at a table adjacent to the bar. Thinking they were shorthanded, I watched as the 3 bartenders yucked it up with the servers around the bar making martinis. When she finally came back, we ordered salads and dinner. We didn't see her again for a while, but finally ordered another round of drinks once our salads arrived...which took another 20+ minutes. Another customer across from our table was obviously complaining to a mgr during our wait, so clearly they weren't having a good night at Firebirds. Dinner finally arrived and we gave up on drinks and had water. We asked for and paid the check the next time I spotted the server. I asked her why the service was so slow and she responded \"she really didn't know, but maybe it was because they had happy hour?\" I asked what was included in happy hour and she explained \"house drinks and half price appetizers\"...who knew? We paid for our full price drinks and dinner ($100) and left. On the way out, the hostess asked how was dinner to which I responded \"unusually slow\". The mgr was standing there and said \"we are still learning\". What an unusual comment and clearly without a care that it will be a longgggg time before we ever return. Oh well, lesson learned! Poor service and customer relations for a restaurant that could easily have done a better job!",

    "text": "We went yesterday to meet with friends we haven't seen in a while. I'm pregnant and a diabetic so my diet is very restrictive. I ordered a steak, medium well, and it came to me rare... like bleeding rare. Usually I can do up to medium rare but since I'm pregnant it's very unsafe. So this time I sent it back. By the time I could even catch our waitress the others were half way done eating their meal. She said she would put in for another steak and it took SO long to get to me, everyone was finished eating and I had to have her box it up. This made me want to cry bc since I'm diabetic, I'm on a schedule with eating and try to stick to it for my testing at every meal. I was 30 minutes away from home so I ate at 915pm, making me stay awake until 1015 so I can do my finger prick. Rewind to our server... she was pretty terrible. Not once did she refill our drinks, we had to ask her for bread twice and it didn't even come until after our meals came out (she said she was waiting for more to be cooked but we saw other servers bringing bread to tables), she never came to check on us or ask how things were, and it took her 15 minutes after taking our payment to bring it back to us. We asked for a box for the under cooked steak because we didn't want it going to waste and my husband could eat it for lunch the next day. She acted as if she was offended or confused that we wanted to take home the rare steak?? I PAID for a steak that I didn't even get to eat... let me do what I want with it. Fast forward to when I got home and looked at the food. I cried. I could barely cut into what looked like cardboard because it was so well done. My husband took out the other steak and was trying to cook it some more so I could just eat that one and we realized that they looked completely different. The first was about 1.5\" thick. The second was pencil thin and did not look like a sirloin at all.. picture for reference. I was so sad and disappointed that I still had to PAY for terrible service, a meal that was never gotten right and I could barely eat. I'll never go to this location again. Imagine denying food to a 7 month diabetic pregnant woman... not good. Let's just say my husband was a saint and my saving grace.",

It took about 10 minutes before the server came to the table but once she did, she made us feel welcome and comfortable.    Food / Beverage: I ordered a non-alcoholic fruity drink and it tasted delicious and was very aesthetically pleasing.  I ordered the Sesame Encrusted Salmon which comes with a fried spinach and one side.  I chose the Parmesan Mashed Potatoes.  The food was off-the-chain delicious and plentiful.  I have never had the fried spinach but it was even better than I imagined.  It was light, well-seasoned and the frying really elevated the vegetable from ordinary to exquisite.  The salmon and the mashed potatoes were both flavorful and a delight to eat.    This is a great date spot and the food is well worth the money.  Go and enjoy the ambiance.",

The waitress made me feel right at home when she came to the table to get my drink order as the others had already ordered. Service to get our alcoholic beverages took forever... we didn't time it, but I'll say this, we forgot we ordered them. The waitress sent over another staff to apologize for the delayed drinks for her while she continued to wait on the bartender to make them. 5 minutes later the manager came by to apologize and took care of the cost of the drinks. Several minutes later she appeared with the drinks. I ordered a \"Tipsy pig\" but did not know a large slice of bacon came in the drink. They happily remade it with substitutions. I ordered the portobello sandwich which was amazing. I could only eat half. It took a while to get the waitress to come back for checks and takeout containers. My cousins and I were so happy to be in each other's company, we didn't dwell on the excessive wait time. But I will say if you are planning to go to this restaurant, especially at lunchtime in my experience, there will be a wait.",

Bridget by the way is a very personable waitress who demonstrates experience well beyond her years. Her recommendations were spot on, perfectly appointed and well paired. My main course was a chili rubbed Delmonico steak. I am a steak snob as a majority of steakhouses fall short of meeting my expectations, Firebird not only met, but exceeded my expectations. I was blown away by the flavor and tenderness of the steak first bite to last.   A testament to a good restaurant is whether you would go back. I can say that I will without a second thought.",

Not to mention,  the precious 2 times, the bartenders tried to charge me for a bottle of wine vs a glass while waiting for a table.  Totally clueless.  The last time we were there the hostesses tole us 20 minutes for our table, while we ended up waiting almost 2 hrs for a booth, which I requested upon arrival, but they obviously weren't listening while they gave our table away multiple times. the only reason we went back tonight was bc the manager that night was very nice and tried to make it right.  But tonight at 600 pm on a Friday, the food was crap!! Smokehouse wings-NOT!!!  Fried, with smoke flavor!! My husband's porterhouse was not worth 30 dollars, and I think my son's cheeseburger and my side salad was the best thing we ordered!!  I will also say our server was on point also, hence the one star..never going back...3 times is a charm after being in the business for 15 years.  over it now.",

While sitting at the bar I engaged in some fun debates with other patrons about the game going on and awaited my food.  I ordered a salmon salad with a viniagrette dressing.  When my food arrived, I was excited about the size and the amount of salmon that i got on the salad.  It was very good.  I haven't ventured back because the price for my salad, and two drinks was alittle too pricey for me to justify a lunch by myself at a bar.   The service was great though and I appreciated the bartender leaving me alone and knowing when to come back.  Thank you!",

I like the strawberry and shrimp salad and stick to that every time I go. My husband has tried many of their steak options and really isn't a fan. They're not worth the money.

The second visit, I had the seared ahi tuna again, smoked wings (very good as well, very tender), coconut shrimp (eh, I'm not big into fried things.. I could do without, nothing special).  I then tried one of their specials, flounder.  I was really happy, and the serving size was huge.  Maybe it was all the appetizers .... (heh), but I was stuffed half way through.

She said it was the best meal she's had in years. Another positive thing is if something is wrong they really do try and make it right. On the not so positive side, the hostesses often seem distracted or engaged with one another. The waiting area is awful but I assume that's to try and make you sit at the bar. However when your food arrives you'll soon forget your entry!  If you don't want your steak rare,  you need to make that known.  Their idea of medium rare is rare everywhere else in America.  I order medium and say NO RED CENTER.  Then you truly get pink all the way through... very nice!",

The very last time I was there they served my bacon wrapped filet, cut in half, horizontal so the filet was only a quarter inch thick with the bacon served on the side. What a disgrace! Then the manager only comped the steak which I didn't even eat anyway. I've given up & will not return.",

Nevertheless, Good prime rib here and 1/2 price wine  on Monday.  Good deal, be back on Monday soon   5/8/2019  Went again on Monday night, got a bottle of Duckhorn decoy cab 1/2 price at$27, fair deal.  The NY steak  was done right the first time, rare medium rare.  Saute spinach also good.  Only complaint was $2 or $3 for a small cup of peppercorn sauce, it was like 3oz  6/10/2019 Pretty mess up evening, order prime rib, got a grill something, might be rib eye, ask if this is prime rib, she said yes, ask if prime rib is grill, she said all steaks were grill here.  Look around for more help, guy came, took my plate came back with prime rib.  That's alright we all made mistake sometime, I still like the prime rib but the mushroom was way too salty....  6/18/2029 Best prime rib I had ever had in here, pretty awesome, almost felt like I was at Lawry, oh not quite.  Monday nite 1/2 price  so it's must have but my bottle was brought to my table opened instead of open in front of me.  Oh well, I did not make a big deal, perhaps management read and will continue to improve training upon fine dining.  For some reason I didn't get a salad last week, so when I was asked, I wad surprised.  Place was good, see you next week !",

Let's start with, yes we made reservation and no the restaurant was not packed. We walked in and immediately told the host we have reservations and gave her our name. She said ok I will be right with you. She left and we never so her again, so then I told the gentleman pretty much the same thing and he looked very lost. So at this time 2-3 more parties come in to be seated and they all were seated before us although we had reservations. At this time I'm getting really annoyed so I remind the manager I think he was that we had reservations and still he took his time seating us. Just not a good start for a place you're spending $50 plus dollars to eat.",

I sat at the bar and had great service from the 3 bartenders. I ordered a glass of the house Cabernet which was actually very good and settled in for a filet, broccoli, and a salad. The salad was pre -dressed in an oil based vinaigrette that I really loved. It wasnt too much. My steak came out prompt and was a perfect medium rare.  This place was BUSY. I was honestly surprised given the volume of people in the dining room, pick up orders, and bar diners that my service was as smooth as it was. My food was delicious and I left very happy. Thank you for a nice relaxing night!",

I think we went once when it first opened and again, it was fine but no more, no less so never went back with family/friends.  I have been back a couple times recently for work dinners however as it's relatively close to one of our buildings.  On those visits I've had steak once and a burger another time and both were good but nothing to write home about.  Service on one of the visits was good but pretty slow, including taking forever to get the check, on the second visit.  I will say that the Caesar dressing is good and really better than I expected.  Also, they put a ton of it on the romaine which is a plus for me but would be a minus if it was served to my wife.  I'd sum up by saying Firebird's is a solid option in/around the Northlake Mall area.",

The restaurant and staff were both good. I went with my family of about 12 people and they handled it very well. We ordered a bunch of different menu items and everyone was happy with their dishes. I always go with the lobster spinach queso as it is one of my favorite dips in all of Charlotte. Must order! I also tried a burger this time which was well prepared.

The restaurant is dimly lit with patio, bar and dining room seating. The wood fire grill is dining room facing and I assume the rest of the kitchen is behind that , so it's kind of neat to be able to see the chefs working on everyone's food ( if your table is closer to that side of the dining area).   This visit the serving team was very prompt. We were met immediately by someone to get our drink order and she informed us that Monday is the day for wine specials ( 1/2 price glasses and bottles I believe). Then our food server brought us our drinks and took appetizer and entree orders .   My husband and I ALWAYS get the buffalo wings when we come here , because they taste as good as they look ( see picture attached ). The bread they serve is also very delicious .  This visit I ordered a salad with chicken, cranberries , goat cheese , nuts and a tasty vinegrette. I highly recommend asking for the dressing on the side when you order. My husband ordered an end-cut piece of....cow??? ( I don't eat a lot of beef so I'm not so sure of the term, but he's says it's tender and juicy). His entree came with a dipping special sauce for the meat and a baked potato.   Great place for date night, to grab a drink after shopping in the mall, family celebration, graduation dinner etc .",

The reasons it didn't get a 5 star rating: seating was really congested and waiters and waitresses were bumping into each other constantly. My drink (an old fashion) took about 30 minutes to finally get to me, and the noise level there due to the close seating made it very difficult to hear what my friend across the table was saying. Other than that, the service was friendly, the food great and parking is dependent on when you go as it is located in a shopping mall.",

My wife's Prime Rib was excellent she said.  The Salad, Potato and the Lobster Spinach Queso were great, although probably a bit pricey for the amount you got with the queso.   Service was really attentive.  For the price, I think I'll probably look elsewhere next time we celebrate our anniversary. It wasn't bad, but for the money, I think we can find something better.",

The sandwich comes with BBQ sauce, Cheddar, Bacon and Red Onion. It's a winner everytime. For those of you looking for a good salad, folks swear by the Strawberry salad. If anyone is doing Weight Watchers, I don't recommend it...it's 28 points. Yikes! Do some shopping and stop by Firebirds...they're usually always connected or near a mall.",

Inside, the restaurant is full of big booths, a decent sized bar and plenty of seating options. While meeting a group of ladies for lunch, I went with the strawberry and grilled shrimp salad - a tasty mix of fresh greens, grilled shrimp, strawberry slices, jicama, candied nuts and a hefty helping of crumbled goat cheese. It was a very delicious choice, especially with the balsamic on the side!  Prices are agreeable for standard, sit down lunch fare. With a fairly diverse menu and solid service, this Firebirds is a solid choice for a Northlake meal.",

Our server was great. i ordered the hot steak with poblano mashed potatoes. i wasn't a huge fan of their special steak sauce and thought the steak was just alright. Potatoes were good, as was the Cesar salad. i sampled the wife's Buffalo Meatloaf and thought that was very good. If i had enjoyed my entree more, everything would have been about top notch.   The Big Daddy Chocolate Cake was actually worth the $7. It was very good. It was big enough for two to split and we even have a small chunk waiting as a leftover...speaking of, i should eat it before the wife does.  Not a place with any sort of beer selection, best options were Sam Adams or New Castle.   Free valet parking was nice.",

Businessmen and corporate American Expresses are abundant, as is the selection of bourbons and gins. I like to have a dirty beefeater Martini with their blue cheese stuffed olives. They have a pretty nice wine list, which is half off on mondays. The beer list is lacking, your basic Blue Moon, Sam Adams, Stella selection.   The menu centers around meat entrees, and most entrees come with a loaded baker. One of the best loaded baked potatos I've had. One complaint: the entrees do not come with a salad. For the price of most things, a salad is needed to justify it.   This is one of those restaurants I like to go to alone, sit at the bar, drink too much and have a big steak....go home and have the best nights sleep ever.",

Inside, the restaruants has tons of booths, rocky wall decor and very much like a fancy hotel in the woods.

Cassy (I believe that was her name) helped place our order for about 10 people and was VERY helpful. The order was perfect, she wrote each person's name on their order, and even helped me carry the bags and drinks to the car. Not only was the service great, the food was as well. My co-workers and I are happy to have a new lunchtime go-to.",

Very popular place, probably thanks to its location in the North Lake Mall.  The decor and atmosphere are very nice.  It is a little loud. If you are looking for a semi-upper scale restaurant to take business clients to then this place works.   Firebirds has a lot of steaks on the menu but I would not consider this a great steak place.  Just okay.  Steaks are along the lines of Outback or Lone Star quality.  They have lots of other menu items if you don't want steak.  My ribeye was tasty but not a great cut of meat.  Firebirds has a full bar (pretty normal these days) and a nice wine selection.  That said, not even the liquor could get me to add a star.  The service was very good so I got to give them that.",

    "text": "This was our first time dining at Firebirds and we were highly disappointed! It was recommended by our hotel unfortunately. The service was basic at best and the food was lukewarm. Our server was not attentive at all! The drinks were horrible. Is there anyone in Charlotte that can make a proper Old Fashion?!?! We went here in hopes of celebrating the new venture, instead we spent the evening waiting for the server. Our appetizer took forever to come out to the table and once it did, it was taken to another table by accident first. Our salads had brown lettuce in them, which was obvious to even a blind person. My steak was overcooked, so I switched entrees with my friend and she even felt it was overcooked and she eats her steaks med-well. Her pasta on the other hand was decent, but it still lacked one of the main ingredients, THE CHICKEN!!!! I had maybe 4 pieces of chicken at most and it was not because she had picked through it. Neither of us finished our meals and we were never offered desert. Keep in mind, the server rarely checked on us, except to pass us on the way to check on the table behind us. But please believe that her presence was felt once the check was on the table. She came by the table more then to see if my card was in yet then she did the ENTIRE meal!!!! We even had to wait on water refills. If this is the type of service that paying customers should expect, I suggest no one ever dine here!",

My mom had to order a water instead because the tea was too sweet for her - I love sweet tea so I enjoyed it. Our waitress brought us bread and it was very yummy. It was tough to cut through with a knife but the inside was very soft. I got the pineapple chicken with mac and cheese and my mom got a burger with sweet potato fries. We were very pleased with both meals! I will definitely be back with my fiance. Two things I would love to try when we go back: Lobster spinach queso dip and the Southern Biscuit Burger.",

    "text": "The mixed greens salad is a must, but I recommend you get the dressing on the side.  They are very generous with the dressing and if you are eating a salad you may want the nutrients but also the low calorie benefit.  With all the sauce I believe the calories are substantially increased, but so is the flavor.  NY Strip steak was cooked to order.  They overcooked the thinnest two inches of steak but the rest of it was properly cooked.  The dogs benefited from the dry portion as it ended up being fed to them.  The baked potato.  It took two tries to get it mostly right.  I asked for only one dairy - sour cream.  That means no cheese and no butter.  I got a potato with one dairy: butter.  I asked for a replacement and it arrived sans butter, and with sour cream.  It was also sitting on top of cheese.  Loose cheese indeed but it was stuck all over half of the bottom of the potato.  I was able to pick it off.  I wish a bit of attention to detail like not splashing cheese all over the plate prior to putting a potato on it was taken.  The waiter was very nice, drink refills were a bit slow, but I did have a real thirst on me that night.",

    "text": "We have found that the bar is an excellent place to share a burger or other 'quick bite' meal free of any young children that seem to pepper the dining room no matter the date or time we go...but last week we decided to split a prime rib and since we'd already settled into a table at the bar, had that served in that area as well.   The level of service was as excellent as at a table, perhaps even more so as we were the 'odd ducks' with others mostly having apps and the waiter was attentive without hovering.   Our meal was done to perfection! I like a rare prime rib, this was perfectly rare and SO flavorful!  The Colorado russet was True perfection--the salted skin gives such a bright flavor to the tender, silky interior and they use actual butter...not 'stuff' on the potato.   We had opted for dessert and ended up having it be the flat point...but that was not necessarily the fault of Firebirds. They have a flourless chocolate cake, which we love generally anywhere we select it, but this one came out covered in strawberries and some sort of glaze. My husband detests strawberries and so it was a no go for him. I do wish that they indicated 'with berries' or at least asked if you wanted them before smothering the dessert in them.   Overall, we have really enjoyed our twice monthly date nights at Firebirds...it's the perfect place for lovebirds and empty nesters...but for the love of all that is holy...leave the fledgelings at home so others can enjoy their night out!",

When I asked if the fish was wild, the answer was sort of. Sort of means not farmed in land, but apparently a contained area in the ocean? So an ocean farm? New one on me. I particularly enjoyed the side of fried spinach, you do not see this often and it is not always done well. The atmosphere is conducive to date night, business, etc, slightly more than casual and the service is good. I will look to see if there is a location in chicago and I would return to try more.",

Half price cocktails and wine on Mondays! So of course that made me extra happy lol  We started with the Lobster Spinach Queso, served with tri-color tortilla chips. This never disappoints. Most of the lobster drops to the bottom so dig deep for the full experience.   Our server was friendly and prompt. Our water was always topped off and promptly refilled also. Nice hot bread too. But it wasnt busy so I didnt expect anything less. Great service!   I ordered the Wood Grilled Salmon with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies (squash, onions, carrots & broccoli). The salmon was impressive and it was well seasoned. I would say that salmon is on the list for best salmon from a restaurant... and the portion was perfect. My meal along side a nice glass of wine really made my dining experience memorable.   My friend ordered Grilled Chicken Breasts (don't know the menu name...) which was served with mashed potatoes and garnished with two huge onion rings. She said the chicken was moist and delicious, so I would recommend her meal also.   I wish they had Firebirds in Maryland.... *sigh*. So the next time I'm near a Firebirds I hope to get similar service and great food!",

Hamburger arrives medium and chicken raw Visit 2:  ordered two different styles of hamburger,  both well done. Same style of burger arrives but cooked right.  Visit 3: 2 Caesar salads and cilantro chicken.  Cilantro chicken arrived like a rubber.

The quality of the food was terrible, I placed a Togo order that included a filet with a baked potato and the chicken pasta. The pasta was dry and the portion size seemed smaller than when we've dined in. The filet was entirely to fatty but the most offensive thing on that plat was the potato which was burnt. It was shocking to think that something so simple to make was served in such a manner, it was inedible.",
