    "text": "I enjoy dining at many of The Cheesecake Factory locations. I have tried many different appetizers and entrees and have yet to be disappointed. My alcohol infused drink was quite tasty, my skinnyliciuos chicken tacos were fresh and flavorful, and the Chris Cheesecake was delicious! I will agree with some of the reviewer's that the wait can be long and tiresome on a Saturday night. But you have to consider the amount of patrons and the establishment is not that big. I wouldn't necessarily say it was not worth the wait. And as another poster mentioned \"Applebee's crowd\" that pretentious a-hole should take his business elsewhere. I read of a decent, good and kind hearted man who is known and loved by many to this day who never judged and would not judge people, his initials are J.C. Maybe some of you know him, doubt the pretentious poster does.",

Even the \"clean\" silverware looks like it's seen better days along with the plates. The finish is coming off the tables. These things make me wonder about their overall cleanliness. The bathrooms are dimly lit so who knows what they're hiding in there. I hadn't been there in a while for these reasons; however, I popped in today for a quick bite while shopping and nothing has changed. I was given dirty silverware, there was something floating in my water and my food that was served on a really stratched up plate was only okay.  Just grab your dessert to go and use plastic utensils!",

This time we got the appetizers after 30 minutes and then only got 2/3 of them and then they served the first dinners with the 3rd appetizer. We had to ask the waitress 3 times for our bottles of water before we got it. The manager came out and apologized for the appetizer coming out so late, and that's fine, of course no problem, that stuff happens. But then the waitress had to be asked three times for the water and we never got out coffee with our cheesecake (which of course was awesome!). I'm shocked at the service and quality. Hope it was just a one off incident or that will be the last time I go. Shame as its my favorite place to go in Charlotte when I come home.",

The food was delicious and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We eat pretty healthy, so at first glance of the menu, we tried to justify how hard we worked out today, haha! But we ended up finding a few healthier options on their new \"skinnylicious\" menu. My one concern was they don't offer a whole wheat pasta. Why?? They offer so much gluten free, but nothing whole wheat. :(",

Instead, I indulged on the Cajun Chicken Jambalaya and the brown bread. The waitress filled up my Sprite three times. ( Too much soda, I know.)

After eating one, I asked the bartender if they were indeed the skinny ones. She said no, they were the regular ones but the only difference was there was more and they are bigger.  She asked me if it was too much food. I told her yes, that was why ordered the skinny ones.  She said oh sorry I didn't hear you say that. I get the bill and they charged for the regular ones. And they weren't going to fix it until I said something. Things like that drive me absolutely insane. I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't want or order. I brought the bartenders attention, his demeanor immediately changed. RUDE.",

We decided to order our cheesecake on our own at the front register thinking it'd be faster....  Twenty minutes later we regretted that choice.

I am always fascinated with the pastel and sky painting, with a splash of regal columns (you find this at every Cheesecake Factories).  Service: Waiters/waitress, on a busy day - they are not at their best. I tend to have my drinks not refilled right away. There is ALWAYS a wait, around 15-45 mins on a busy night. I honestly avoid this place, because of the long wait.  Lunch time is the time to go, at best.  Food: There is an eclectic food selections that are diverse. There are pizza, Italian and Asian cuisines, plethora of cheesecakes to choose from, burgers and sandwiches...  - I liked their iceberg lettuce salad - their strawberry shortcake dessert is delicious with vanilla ice cream! - raspberry ice tea, always refreshing - shrimp scampi, safe, but good in large portions - chicken Parmesan, always a winner with my hubby  Price: pricey. I believe it is worth it, in terms of big portions.. Enough for little ole me to take home as leftovers for work.",

I knew it was going to be expensive when I saw the 40 ft high ceilings. Someone has to pay for all this air.   The noise level is amazing. I could barely hear the bartender when I ordered a drink. As I sat there sipping on a glass of wine I noticed massive portions of food being served. I saw salads that could feed a village in Afghanistan.  What is with the massive portions? I ordered an Angus burger that had to be 3/4lb to 1 lb,  loaded with onions and mushrooms. The place is also pricey but then............  It finally hit me. When you go to the Cheesecake factory you order an entree you want to eat at your next two meals. So you really need to focus on which items are a good for reheating  and taste good as leftovers.  By spreading the meal over two or three meals makes the high prices seem very reasonable. So this is why people wait 45 minutes to 2 hours to eat at the Cheesecake factory.",

    "text": "I've been there twice and it's a good place to go on a nice date. I prefer the places that are more casual or they have their own thing going on, but I won't hold that against The Cheesecake Factory.  This place is obviously known for their cheesecake, in case you couldn't figure that out by the name of the restaurant, so I will start by talking about what they do best and move onto the meal from there. All slices of cheesecake are big and rich enough to share. These things are huge and if you're eating one by yourself then you are either a mammoth or your pig. Don't hate! Just embrace the truth! My wife and I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, which had Hulk testicle size chunks of cookie dough inside of the cheesecake. With two big squirts of whipped cream on the top and the tip of the cheesecake to complete the imagery that I'm shooting for. It was simply amazing!  When the waitress first stopped by to ask what we would like to drink I asked for water and an Old Fashioned. To which she replied \"How hot would you like that?\" That's when I learned that one of their burgers is called The Old Fashioned. As I write this I now realize that I should have ordered The Old Fashioned to go w/ my Old Fashioned, but let me tell you what I did get before I get too carried away. I got Renee's Special which consisted of a Turkey Sandwich, the Soup of the Day (Clam Chowder) and a House Salad. Very tasty! My only complaint on the food was that the bread, I believe it was Sour Dough was too hard. Not stale or anything, just the crust was hard as a Hulk sized... ...never mind.  My Old Fashioned was very tasty and helped me take my mind off of the man taking his three disrespectful daughters out. This good man was taking his daughters out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and all three of them were on their phone and iPads. Hopefully it doesn't take him having a heart attack from the cheesecake he ate for them to realize how disrespectful they were being.  I would give 5 Strong stars but I'm going to subtract one for how close the tables were. I didn't even have to lean over to take the food from the person next to me. I wasn't trying to make friend that evening, just enjoy the company w/ my wife.",

Our party of four arrived at 1:45pm to learn the person who answered the phone did not record our reservation. The hostess was less than helpful and gave us a pager to wait like the other 25 parties there! Dissatisfied, I grabbed a manager who was gracious enough to rectify the situation.   Our waitress was kind and pretty attentive. Our entree selections included shepherd's pie, shrimp scampi without tomatoes that arrived with tomatoes, kids' pizza and a Cuban sandwich. Everything tasted ok. If you do have the shrimp pasta, know that it comes with five shrimp, not many noodles and barely any \"sauce\". Oh and we did have a good appetizer, the buffalo blasts!  Known for their cheesecake selections, you can't go wrong. I have a caramel pecan turtle concoction waiting in the fridge for me now. It will make up for the beginning of our experience.",

Its a popular destination. The food is OKAY. I mean its called the Cheesecake factory not the Food factory.   Pros: You can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait. Its posted outside. Dim lighting...I love me some romantic mood lighting on dates. My dish of choice is the Louisiana chicken. The chicken is fried to perfection and the pasta is delightful. They serve you bread when you are seated which is warm and delicious. The cheesecake. OMG the cheesecake. I haven't had one I didn't like. They have any kind you can think of. My favorites are the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and the Banana Cream. Ok now my mouth is watering.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, Ive been to the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times but as server this was the worst experience of my life, and I'm not even exaggerating.  The server Leticia started off decent.... she didn't know how to discuss one of the entrees with my cousin and was coming off very rude and stand off ish. On a Monday night we waited approximately 35-40 minutes on our food. Our water was empty for almost 30 mins while we waited for our food that had to be sent back several times. My aunt ordered a pasta dish that had a basil drizzle as a garnish (that was not listed) and sent it back, it took 20 mins to receive that entree (everyone was finished with their meal). There was many server errors within this experience such as bringing sauce when food is complete, not enagaging in our request, slamming spoons on the table for dessert, the list can go on. My biggest issue is ordering a salmon for  $21 and it was cold...which is ok however, when I asked for it to be sent back, when it came back to the table the entree was STILL cold! At this point I wanted to talk to a manger or something, CJ the manager who came over had every excuse in the book as to why my salmon, mashed potatoes, asparagus and cream sauce was borderline freezing (as if taken out of the cooler). He was standing there kind of going back and forth with myself and my cousin (both of which are server) trying to justify my cold dish. I specifically told him to make me a BRAND new piping hot salmon and I want it to go because we are on a time constraint and we have to leave. 2-5 minutes later he shows up with my ORIGINAL salmon in a to go container over a plate and it is STILL cold. I am pissed the h**l off!  This night was supposed to be an amazing night for my family and I and turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had or one that I've ever seen. To top it off this fool comped my dessert as well as my aunts food but my Salmon that had issue was still on the bill.  Because I know how this industry works paying $158 for this experience is not sitting well with me and I do not recommend this location whatsoever, this restaurant was very unprofessional and unpleasant as if it was their first day on the job.  My family and I will not be returning!",

    "text": "It's the Cheesecake Factory, initially I'm not a big fan because I've been there done that since high school back home in Chicago. However I have a teenager and this place ROCKS to teens so we end up here from time to time unfortunately.  When I'm forced to eat here I enjoy the small plates menu items which include the avocado rolls, salmon rolls & mushroom pizza. Our teenager ALWAYS indulge in the Buffalo Blast as an app and chicken tenders with fries as a main course. The hubby alternates between Jamaican Black Bean chicken and the Miso Salmon. I personally LOVE the Miso however this location is off on flavor and the whole Miso experience.   It's pretty weird that Grand Luxe Cafe and Cheesecake Factory are owned by the same company. I prefer Grand Luxe as its much more upscale and the food options are better and much more tasty and presented better. Grand Luxe would've been a perfect fit for SouthPark mall, wishful thinking as I'm a Chicago girl and we have it ALL.  The dessert choices include the Lemon cake/cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake and the chocolate cake.  Enjoy if you like 1,000's of confusing options and the pain of the mall traffic and long waits without the ability to make reservations.",

Wait ten more minutes staring at this sentence.  I bet you just kept reading.  I didn't have that option.  With a squad of hungry children flailing about we waited over forty minutes after the apps, and that is even longer than our order time, for our food.  It took forever and our waiter avoided us most of that time.  It was excruciating with children flipping over complaining they are starving.  I was feeling the same way.  I made it through part of my meal and then I didn't feel well.  I wanted to pay and leave.  That took far longer and we had some bill errors that had to be fixed.  The entire thing took even longer.  I wasn't feeling well and the moment I got my credit card back I bolted for the door.  Get your dessert here and you are fine.  Order an entree at your own risk.  I suggest Maggianos for drinks and food, and the factory for cake.",

My waitress kept forgetting about us(my daughter and I). I ordered a burger and added mozzarella cheese. My burger was supposed to come with fries but I never received my fries. My waitress later apologized and offered to boxed them up so I can take them to go. She later returned with the bill and NO fries stating that the cost of the mozzarella cheese ($1.50) was removed from my bill instead. She placed the bill on the table and walked away. About 10 -15 mins went by and I was still waiting to pay my bill. I got impatient and walked to the bar area near the patio to pay. At first the waitress standing there was hesitant to to process my bill but I explained what was going on she processed it and walked away. I could have walked out without paying or without leaving a tip but that's not me.   Next time I will stick to just the cheesecake!",

The presentation looks great but the I could taste everything but the fish. The fish was unfortunately bland. I've had better for a lot cheaper at food trucks. I think everything on the menu is way overpriced and there are just way too many items to choose from.   I think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake.   The service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception. Maybe it's the wax they use but they should reconsider this as it is prone to lead to accidents and injury.   Probably would only come back for dessert but nothing else.",

    "text": "I was shocked at this restaurant after eating at the Cheesecake Factory in DC this past August. My granddaughter wanted to celebrate her boyfriend's  birthday along with mine and 2 others family members with birthdays next week. 10 of us met at south park at 3 in the afternoon. My granddaughter told the hostess how many and was told it would be 1 to 2 hour wait and given a beeper. We decided to walk around the mall and thought it surly will not be 2 hours. At 2 1/2 hrs we checked and were told it would be another 1 to 2 hours. At this point you think oh heck no, but you have already waited so you continue to wait. At 6:20 after many more checking with the hostess our beeper went off. We were seated at a table for 8, not 10. They then get 2 more chairs and look upset that it was required. Our waitress comes over takes drink orders and my husband orders a mix drink while everyone else orders tea or soda and one young man with us under 21 says jokingly I will take one of what he is having and his mom says no he will not he is underage. When she returns she gives him a mix drink and never asked for ID. My husband drank it after drinking his because he did not want to get her in trouble. She comes back and asks if the young man (18 yrs) with us would like another and we all say no. We waited for our meal for over an hour. When it came out the young man that was served alcohol had no meal. It took another 30 minutes for his to be served. The food was not great, the Steak was tough, black beans were hard and overall taste not good. Then she said they were busy so if we wanted dessert we needed to let her know because it would a while for it to be served. It is the Cheesecake Factory, so yes we wanted dessert. Half ordered desserts to go and half to eat there. They brought out the to go order and then 15 minutes later they bring the other desserts. The to go orders were literally half of the size of the ones served at our table. The only food that was worth the problems would have been the free ice cream sundae.  Will not return or recommend. It was a totally different experience from the Cheesecake Factory in DC.",

This may be the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. The waits are ridiculous, the traffic from the mall combined with the fact that it's the only Cheesecake Factory makes for exceptionally long waits throughout the day (despite many open tables within my line of vision).   They are ridiculously over priced - especially for the quality of food. I'd say average at best, but nothing that warrants the price tag. The salmon is tasteless (they sell it as fresh lol). Chicken is dry, some pasta noodles were hard still towards the ends. Had a salad that cost me $13ish and was soggy as hell.   Service is hit or miss.  Come here for the cheesecake, and that's all.",

We had no silverware when we were sat but it did come with the bread. Our service was ok...she was nice. Her timing was off but considering waiting tables while pregnant is a challenge....she did ok. Our food arrived fine but we had ordered chicken OTS with the four cheese pasta and it arrived 20 minutes after the entrees and it was bland. I asked for a manager to bring this kitchen issue to his attention, he never showed up. When the server who dropped off our food didn't have the chicken with him, he confirmed we were missing it but it was 20 minutes for it to arrive. We had finished eating by then.

Then my salad had 4 small cubes of beets, 4 cubes of goat cheese, and a whole asparagus cut into small pieces (count them if you ever get the salad) so basically, I had a bad of lettuce. I figured this must be the limit so I ask for more toppings or I'd take it back. (With all of the great restaurants coming to the area, you can't afford to skimp in ingredients, and take away from the quality). The manager pretty much said that he would take it off as I'm leaving without eating. So of course he would, I didn't eat it. I had the chance to go to Yafo Mediterranean Kitchen, a new restaurant down the street, but it was too late. Cheesecake Factory is not what it used to be.",

I figured I'd order a cheesecake to go while I waited so I can eat something. My pager went off so when I turned it in, I told the lady I'm waiting for my order. She took the pager and called the next name so I proceeded back in line. A guy calls my name and I tell him the same story so he said he was getting me seated since he can't hold tables and would have my order transferred. He said they were busy. Then he asked if I needed a menu and I said no.( I knew what I wanted. Not the friendliest guy.  So as I get seated, there was a five minute wait for a server to ask me what I had so I have her the receipt and she took my drink order. I was starving at that point and saw how busy it was I knew I didn't want to eat there. My cheesecake was finally brought to me after my drink and surprisingly I wasn't asked if I wanted anything. I couldn't wait to leave.  I love the Cheesecake Factory but this left a bad taste in my mouth. The server was nice enough to give me a to go cup for my lemonade.",

    "text": "I came here for my birthday lunch, and as I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in for-ever, it was really nice to kick it old school...  *Pros* -Outdoor seating. Having spent the entire winter, and well into March in a snowy DC mess, it was great to sit on the outdoor patio at 4:00 in the afternoon with a Root Beer and a cool breeze blowing in my face. -Minimal wait. Maybe no one wanted to sit on said patio, but the waiting area was 50 people deep of couples, families, etc and we only had a 10 minute wait for first available.  -That wide variety of menu items you know and love from CF, including a nice selection of lunch portions (and lunch prices).  -Friendly staff. Something I miss once I moved to the DMV. -Quality ingredients, and tasty food. I ordered the lunch grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes for $13.95. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. Other dishes ordered at the table included a cheeseburger, cobb salad, and chicken wings. All were devoured.  -Food presentation is great. I love the way they serve the dishes to you with thought and care. -Happy Birthday! My cheesecake plate had Happy Birthday written on it, with a pink candle for me to blow out! They also sang Happy Birthday to me. Ahh never gets old even in my late 20's!  *Cons* -My broccoli was served cold. I mean ice cold.  -The fountain drinks all tasted flat no matter what you ordered. -When my husband ordered after dinner coffee, and she asked if he wanted a refill she did not tell him refills were not free. Normally, they leave the pot, or bring the pot over and fill 'er up. Nope, he was charged another $3 bucks for black coffee. Party foul!  All in all a great birthday lunch with good times and good food.",

Sadly, I live in Columbia, SC, and this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to where I live.  My sister loves it here (well mainly for their cheesecakes), so we decided to make a small road trip up here several days ago.  Unlike the name suggests, you can order more than cheesecakes here.  Even though we were originally going to have lunch here, we decided just to stick with cheesecake for dessert. Looking at their menu (briefly might I add and going on when I actually did have dinners here), you can get your typical dinners here (chicken, stekas, pizza) and price wise, it is the about the same as other dinner places you might go to.  The menu does seem overwhelming (as we were only looking for desserts) as this particular location was also running ads for other businesses in the area (not aure if all locations do this as well).  Loved the decor as well.  It made you fell like you were eating at a classy place without having to be overly dressed and not paying over the top prices either.",

A huge menu which I've had the pleasure of trying out most of their options. A meal can range anywhere from $12 (for a burger) to $30 (for the filet). $20-25 per person is the usual on how much I spend. What makes it so great is the food is worth the price but portions are usually double or even triple size.  My favorite appetizer is the fried macaroni and cheese. My favorite entree is the ribeye. And the best entree for the money, is the Cajun Chicken Littles. About 10-12 normal sized, delicious, hand breaded, crispy, chicken tenders, a scoop of awesome mashed potatoes, and some very good corn succotash; just a $15.99 price tag.  Highly recommend TCF.",

    "text": "We came here because Cheesecake Factory being a corporate restaurant typically you get the consistency. Not this time.  We arrived around 11:00 restaurant was empty. Maybe 5 tables in the entire establishment, we asked to sit outside (there was one table sitting outside 2 ladies who had just received their food) the hostess- younger girl- double chained gold necklace with her name on it which I cannot remember now and glasses told us \"it will be a 10-15 min wait\" we looked at each other and asked why? She responded with \"we only have one server on\" HOW IS THAT MY PROBLEM?? I should preface this that I ran a restaurant for well over a decade and my husband is the executive chef to a neighboring restaurant. His response to me was \" we would never get away with saying that\" how is having one server on our problem as a paying guest when the restaurant is empty and another sever could easily pick up the table?\" Food for thought management.  We decided to sit inside and I will say the ONLY positive thing about our experience was our Server and his trainee. They were prompt- attentive- polite and didn't leave us wanting for anything.  Food- we ordered 2 kids meals to start and an appetizer of the spinach dip followed by the Thai lettuce wraps and nachos. The one thing about cheesecake that we've loved is the food is always consistent we order the same things because we LOVE them. Not this time unfortunately. The kids food and dip came out kind of timely- but not for an empty restaurant- it's come out faster when they were packed FULL. Spinach dip was cold. I didn't say anything because being one of the industry you just don't. Then the GAP. For nachos and lettuce wraps it took a good 10-15 minutes for them to follow. The wraps were good. My husbands nachos were luke warm and completely bland- nothing like they have been in the past. He decided not to eat- the sever came To check on us and we explained.  He then offered to send a manager over. After a few more Moments passed be returned with this response \" I'm just going to take them off of the check- I'm sorry about that- the manager is just too busy to come by\" I'll repeat the restaurant was empty. They were \"picking up\" But 80% of the tables were vacant. After the sever walked away... guess what happened? A MANAGER WALKED BY. Quickly not stoping and touching any tables  On his way around (Middle Aged man darker hair wearing a blue-Ish shirt and tie) mind you we were just told 2.5 seconds prior the managers were to BUSY to come by and it was just easier to remove the item from the bill?!!!   How is this even acceptable?! And of all places a major corporation who doesn't even pay for advertising bc their reputation is THAT GOOD! How is your manger being too busy to come to a table ok? How is telling paying customers there is only one server on and put us on a BS wait to sit outside (on a beautiful day I might add- your manager didn't set themselves up for success on that floor plan) and Serving cold food when your restaurant is empty how is any of this acceptable?!",

We got there early to put our name in for a table since the wait is usually long and they do not take reservations (which is absolutely absurd). They said it would be an hour wait which was fine since the rest of the people that were eating dinner with us were not scheduled to arrive until the time they said we would have a table. When our pager went off early we went to get the table and get some drinks & appetizers while waiting on others to arrive. They said we couldn't do that and had to have the majority of our party present to be seated. This would have been good information to have when we put in our name. It took an HOUR AND A HALF to get a table after our name was called initially. Then once we were seated, it took over an hour to get any food. Had this not been for a birthday & we could have all gone somewhere else, we would have. It was absolutely unacceptable to make people wait that long especially when the restaurant didn't have that many large groups. The two managers kept telling us, \"oh we're wiping down a table for you right now.\"  DO NOT go to this location. The food was extremely over priced for what we got on top of everything. There are so many other restaurants around there that are much",

    "text": "This is a large restaurant located in the South Park mall. They are always busy or crowded it appears and there is always a wait which can range from  15 minutes to 3 hours. They have valet service and you can skip the dinning experience and order to go or desserts at the counter in the front.   I was able to dine one evening when they had the 15 minute wait time. Our buzzer went off and we were seated. The buzzer was greasy. I had hand sanitizer so I was okay. Not sure if it was wiped off between patrons in this flu season. Prior to being seated I had time to review the menu and use the restroom. The restrooms were semi clean. With the high percentage of guests they can clean more often.   I placed my drink order upon being sat. For some odd reason I reminded my waiter twice about my drink order. He totally forgot it appeared. He seemed distracted. The table beside me had the same issue. The service just was non existent. Unfortunately service can make or break an experience.    The menu was hilarious from glamburgers to skinnylicious. Someone who has an extra personality made this menu.  I had the grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The food was good. The salmon was a bit salty, but there was plenty to take home. The texture and temperature of my dish were great. I had the strawberry martini which was sweet and designed in a cute style. I had two meals due to the large portion size of the salmon dish. I decided to skip dessert. I was so full from dinner over eating wasn't in my plans. There was some dessert options I will come back to try, maybe to go.   I am all to familiar with cheesecake, but got a chance to try the \"Queen city\" location. I have a theory they get business because of the name. I hope they can grow on so many aspects.",

The waitress let us know from the beginning what they was out of and the wait time on dessert. She also make sure we were good and food time wasn't too bad.

    "text": "The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory (besides all the Cheesecake) is that their menu is so expansive and there really is something for everyone to eat there. This was only my second time there but every time I have the hardest time picking out what to get because I want to pick more than one!   We started with Buffalo Blasts as an appetizer and they come with 8 giant pieces! I was shocked when I saw the amount! They're basically fried Buffalo chicken dip and man were they good! With all the food that was yet to come, we probably didn't need to get them, but I'm still glad we did.   My boyfriend and I each got a pasta dish which were very generous portions and both were very very good. My only complaint about the entire experience is that I could tell that my pasta was sitting out for a little while, so I guess we were waiting on my boyfriends meal before they could serve it to our table. It was still good and pasta is always a good leftover choice.   Of course we ended the meal with Cheesecake. We decided to split one and got the cookie dough cheesecake. It was so so so good. In the words of my boyfriend \"I'm glad I've had plain cheesecake before this or I would expect all Cheesecake to taste just like this\". It tasted exactly like cookie dough.   I would definitely come here again. It can definitely get pricy as their menu is so large and you just want everything, but maybe more frequent trips would make me feel like I can just pick one thing at a time!",

He also never refilled my only drink (water). Anyway, it was my husband's birthday and I was surprised that the Cheescake Factory does not give a free slice of cheescake on your birthday (even if you can prove it). I guess they would end up losing money. Instead the waiter sings happy birthday which we all could have done without. I had the lunch margherita pizza and Caesar salad, both were huge portions, fresh, and delicious. My husband had a turkey burger with a garden salad; which I also sampled and it was tasty.  My niece had steak diane with mashed potatoes which is apparently her go-to favorite dish when she visits the CF. We also ordered 3 slices of cheescake to go (since we we all so stuffed from lunch): Coffee and cream, lemon raspberry cream, and cherry Ghirardelli chocolate. My coffee and cream slice was savory and rich. It took two days to finish it. Hubby inhaled his in one sitting later that evening.  We will be back for other special occasions when we are in the area. We are still waiting for a Cheesecake Factory to come to Columbia, SC!",

He brought out a small dish of what appeared to be gelatinous strawberry filling that couldn't have been drizzled if you tried. Absolute fail!

A  little bit later waiter came to table with the word the order was forgotten and will be soon and the manager would be out to talk to us. After the others in my party were done eating my order came but no manager, after about half way through my meal the waiter stoped by we ordered dessert at this time hoping it would be there by the time I finished eating, no such luck. After finishing eating waiter showed up say sorry they were backed up at dessert counter, you think after screwing up on the food order they would have made sure dessert would be on time but no and still no manager. After another 10 min a different person comes by with the cakes says sorry for the wait very busy and started to walk away, I said wait are you the manager yes he was, I said I was told you would stop by because of the problem with my order. He said he did not know anything about it sorry but would take 1 dessert off the bill. Well the food was very good but no matter how good the food is even if it was free it is not worth it with this service NEVER AGAIN!! at this location.",

Sadly, they do not have any drink specials during happy hour. :( The food though, is amazing! $5.50 for actually small plate sizes, which is a lot. I made the \"mistake\" of ordering 3 apps for the 2 of us, so much food! We ordered the mac and cheese balls, cheese and spinach dip and southwest chicken rolls. Everything was really good though the cheese and spinach dip could have benefited with some seasoning. The mac and cheese balls and the southwest chicken rolls were very hearty, we had to take a lot of food home with us.   What I did not like was how much the Long Island Iced Tea costs (I docked 1.5 stars for this), I blew $10.70 for a watered down drink. It did not feel like that much alcohol was in there. I won't be buying drinks from here again.   The half off THE FIRST SLICE of cheesecake was a great deal, my boyfriend and I each bought a slice. I got the caramel turtle while he got the tiramisu. The caramel turtle was amazing, wasn't too cream cheesy and had the right amount of sweetness. The tiramisu was just meh, I wouldn't get it again.   Don't forget to complete the feedback survey, you get $10 ecredit towards your next purchase. Pretty worth it if used during happy hour (there is no fine print saying you can't).",

The falafel was good but there was something about the dressing that I can't put my finger on that I didn't like, but the veggies tasted fresh and was good otherwise! Of course I couldn't leave there without getting myself cheesecake, and tried the pumpkin pie one which was absolutely delectable!

He called the manager who just came over and looked irritated he just said we will switch it out no sorry's or anything . We finally got the calamari after our entres and almost at the end of the meal so what's the point of that \"appetizer\" .So we got our entrees I ordered a steak Diane and our server didn't brother to bring a steak knife until my husband finally flagged him down again and he looked irritated, we also got the shrimp scampi which didn't come with the angel pasta as so that's what our server told us I looked up in the website and it clearly says its served with angel pasta and our server just said oh it's separate and left quickly. Seemed like he didn't want to serve us , me and my husband are pretty young we are 23 and maybe he thought we wouldn't leave him a good tip but we always do when we dine out .

They also get the food to you in a hurry so that it doesn't every get cold, if it isn't supposed to be, waiting to arrive at your table.   -The bathrooms are always clean and fully stocked.   -The bar is an awesome area where the bartender is super nice and can help you pick the perfect cocktail to complement your choice of cheesecake (or food). -The food ranges from pasta to salads to seafood to anything you can think of.  There is no shortage of options when it comes to this menu!!   Lastly, the music they play is always best enjoyed on the outside patio on a nice afternoon with a glass of wine.  The patio is my choice of seating!!    My only critical review would be that the waiter who brought our cheesecakes to our table reeked of cigarette smoke.  Not such a big fan of the stuff and kind of makes me nauseated.  (Not really a feeling I'm going for after stuffing my face with awesome food)  Love this place!!",

    "text": "So this review was just because of national cheesecake day.  So every year they do half off cheesecakes,  we'll you would think they would be prepared for this day way in advance and make sure they have enough staff to get this process efficiently.  We got there and people had no idea where the kine was or where people were waiting or where to go to get in the restaurant.  Then it took about 20 mins to order.  So we were excited that it wasn't too bad because of all the confusion.  But then we waited and waited and waited...  It took 50 more minutes before we even got our cheesecake.  People who ordered after us were getting there cheesecakes before us and there was no organization to the process at all.  You would think they could have just kept pieces of cheesecake already in the boxes so they could give it to people immediately.    Sorry this review doesn't completely reflect the whole restaraunt because we didn't even eat there so I can not talk about their service at all.  So I don't want this to reflect them Completely...  But I just wanted to let people know not to go on busy days like that!!",

Sure, it's not \"fine dining\", but the food is always good and the portions are so large! With that said, my sister threw me a baby shower at this location on 2/13/16. They don't take reservations per se, but my sister was assured, 3 weeks ahead of time, that they would hold the back room open for our party of 25. My sister called the morning of the shower to make sure everything was still a go. This was around 10:45 am and she was notified that there was already a line of patrons outside the door. We hurried to the restaurant and arrived around 11:30 am and were told that the room and tables we were promised had already been taken!!  We decided to stay and wait, as invitations had been mailed out, and it was too late to change locations. Suffice it to say, we did not get seated until after 1 pm. This was difficult for me because I am 9 months pregnant and hadn't eaten because I never anticipated the wait.   I ordered my favorite, Chicken Madeira, which was good as always, but the occasion was really ruined by the long wait.",

I was upset that most of the cheesecake was sold out but Tavaris let us know that the shipment had not came in yet. But over all we enjoyed the food and will return",

Not only was the server rude and couldn't muster a smile the entire time, but our food took an hour to come out. We tried explaining we were on break and only had an hour, only to get eye rolls in response. The end result was all of our food having to be boxed and taken home to eat after work and we ate bread for lunch. Not a pleasant experience, literally all our server had to do was apologize for the food taking longer and smile. Instead we left with empty stomachs and a bad mood.",

I always get the salmon dish, one of them is not on the menu anymore (which is sad ), but they have another one that is delicious. The Cheesecake of course is fantastic (the Godiva, I highly recommend). Here comes a bit of a rant. If Cheesecake Factory is reading this, PLEASE start taking reservations on weekends. A close friend of mine loves this restaurant, so we decided to take her on a Saturday night to this place to celebrate. They do not take reservations on weekends. I get there and there is literally a 3 hour wait... My jaw dropped, this place was packed. I could hardly get in the entrance door. People were running into me, I was running into them, yikes . I don't see how many of those people even got seated. There is no way. We ended up taking our party else where. Just be aware of this if you decide to go there on a weekend night. Service is just ok, some are more attentive than others, but a nice place. I will be going there again, but not on a weekend night. On weekdays it's quick to be seated.",

Not only did our server disappear, we had to wait for a whole hour before our food was served. For that whole hour we were also ignored and asked for a bucket of ice for our bottle of wine, which came. We then tried to wait to see if she had said anything to the manger but we realized that she hadn't. So we reached out to the manager about everyone around us were served and leaving before we got served. But the manage handed our check off to another server who never brought it back to the table. Finally we decided to head to the hostess stand to find where our check went. So bottom line, it was horrible service and the management/servers/kitchen was extremely unprofessional and we will not be going there ever again.",

    "text": "This review is about their take out delivery service.    We have ordered take out from this location for years and it has always been a very simple and fast process.  We usually order takeout because frankly eating at The Cheesecake Factory should not be an all night experience.  You call them up on the drive over and by the time you are there you walk in pay for your food and leave. It's really genius.  Apparently in the last couple weeks The Cheesecake Factory has decided to expand the \"wait experience\" of their dine-in guests to their take out guests as well.  The issue that i'm describing has never occurred in the 10+ years we've visited this establishment, but it happened the last two times we've been there which is what is prompting this review.    Last night it took 21 minutes on hold before i could place my order.  You may say that they are busy.  OK, i get that.  Yes they are busy, they are almost always busy in the evenings.  This hasn't changed in the last 10 years.  It is also compounded by the fact there is someone there who answers the phone immediately.  it's not until you say that you want to place a pickup order that you get the hold experience from hell.  I'm not really sure what other types of calls they receive that aren't pickup orders, but you would think that these types of calls would be handled in an expedited manner. I mean i'm trying to give them money. I mean the primary income for this restaurant comes from selling food right? Who of you would put someone on hold for 20 minutes when they are trying to give you money?  it's absolutely absurd. Maybe it takes an extra 20 minutes for the order to be prepared because of their \"busyness\",  but there is no excuse for someone to wait on hold this long to place an order.  Can the primary receptionist not be trained to take orders? I've seen their computers, they aren't that much different from the terminals at Mc Donalds. Are there more important things that they are responsible for that are making the company more money than they would by selling food?  Lest you think I'm the only one of this opinion.  When we were in line to pay for the order after 20+ minutes on the phone the person ahead of us had the same complaint.  They were so tired of waiting that they just wanted to cancel their order and leave.  Believe me, i felt the same way.  There are too many other good choices of restaurants in the South Park area to waste your time here.  I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory, your food is good, but i'm going to have to take my business elsewhere.",

I even checked on their website that they will do this. When we arrived I informed the hostess that it was my daughter's birthday. The server even said the birthday girl can order first. Everyone did enjoy the food even though it was way too much to eat. When the cheesecake arrived nothing was written on it and no candle! I quickly asked if they could write Happy Birthday and put candle on it. Then our server came back with the cheesecake and said \"Did you think I forgot about you?!\" Yes you did and she just stood there while we sang which was annoying. I then witnessed a young lady get a cake with writing and a candle plus several servers were singing?! I asked my husband to address the issue with the manager. The manager didn't seem to care. He was only concerned about us paying and leaving. Not good customer service at all!",

When we finally did get to the table to sit, we weren't greeted for about 15 minutes and that was the best part of the evening. After taking our orders, our waitress didn't check on us again until the food was served but but by that time my wife and I had no water just ice cubes sitting lonely in the bottom of our glass. I ordered the Miso Salmon and my wife ordered the Petite Filet. I wasn't pleased at all with the Salmon because it was pink in the middle and my wife didn't really care for the Filet because it wasn't cooked to order. We decided not to have the food sent back because it would've taken forever and two days to get the food back.   The wait staff seemed like they could care less and on many occasions they were simply MIA. They tried to push desert on us but we were ready to go and get desert someplace else. This is not the type of service I expected because I've been to other Cheesecake locations across the states and this was the worst experience. The staff needs more customer focused training and being attentive not blind to the needs of your clients. I based on this experience couldn't recommend you to spend your money here unless you enjoy mediocre service. I don't write my review lightly because I understand that business can get packed and scheduling issues can affect service but if you're in SouthPark, fix that if you expect to stay relevant!",

The kind wait staff are indistinguishable from Chick-fil-A employees.  The menu can easily be mistaken for a phonebook.   The bathrooms parallel dimly lit, royal throne rooms of old.   The bill has an uncanny resemblance to the U.S. national debt.   The cheesecake, however, is distinctly unique. It cannot be confused with anything else, for it is the object that other great and wonderful things are confused with. It is, indeed, the magnum opus of the dessert world.",

Reservation was at 6, we didn't get our food until 8. We didn't get out of the restaurant until 1030. What a mess of a biethday celebration it was. We made reservations and the service was still poor. Done!",

    "text": "Ive eaten at Cheesecake Factory at other locations and had a much better experience, so here we go....We arrive around 12ish on a sunday, which was a horrible time at the South Park mall, dont do it, unless U are jus that bored.  We waited approx 1hr, didnt leave because we knew all the other restaurants would have the same wait time. Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a \"hey how are U\" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said \"no its a Garnish and we cant do that\". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize.   The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child. But I feel U should give 100% at work at all times, if not GO home, plenty of people need a job. Im not always happy at work either but I make sure I dont reflect this in my service to the public. Once a manager or owner of a business has mastered this with there employees U will have happy customers who will wait and return. I went to Olive Garden the next day, and the staff were all 100% my waiter earned the 20% I left him. I never asked for anything, he was very professional and they were busy on Memorial Day!!  Now this tops it off, before leaving I saw Miss Whitney show my receipt to the manager, I left no TIP, she made a weird face to him....really do U expect me to leave my hard earned money to someone who was rude to my family???  I wont return, my coins will B spent elsewhere....ENUFFSAID",

    "text": "Absolutely disgusting. Went with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday and the service and food were very poor. Despite the extra dim atmosphere and lack of customers, I still found a bug in my salad, the spaghetti, and meatball (came with only 1 small meatball) was raw in the middle, and the steak tacos ordered were actually chicken. When asked if one person wanted cheese on their meal, they very clearly and politely said, \"no thank you\" were acknowledged, and the waitress still returned with a spoonful of cheese that she carelessly dumped on his meal anyway. A manager came by and acknowledged that the steak was actually chicken without us mentioning it, but just offered to charge us for the chicken instead. Aside from the bug, the lettuce wraps had rotten and dried out cabbage that is not edible and the hot fudge Sunday we ordered to celebrate our reason for being there was nearly all whipped cream with a separate dish of hot fudge that looked and felt more like a lumpy coagulated clot sitting in a pool of clear oil. It was not pourable, and did not even appear safe for to eat. I would absolutely not recommend this location.  Despite the issues that the waitress was aware of( the raw meatball, and the wrong order) we still were charged and paid full price.",

The problems began when We finally sat down (our party of 4) and  about 5 minutes went by, we were asked what we would like to drink (3 waters and a coke), the waitor took almost 10 minutes to get them to us. Then walked off 5 more minutes pass and we place our order (at 9:40 pm). The table beside us finished there meal, a new couple sat down. They ordered, there food was brought, they ate,paid there check and left. Still no food at our table. Finally at 11:00, two plates were brought to our table and about 5 minutes later the other two. The fries were so hard and old we didnt even eat them. When we finished eating I asked for the check, he asked if we wanted cheesecake, we all said no, he walked away, came back with a menu and said would yall like cheesecake. I politely said \"no, just my check\" he brought it then after what seemed like forever finally came back to take my card to run it. This was the worst experience I've ever had at a cheesecake factory.",

    "text": "We usually visit this location 1-2 a month... I personally had a horrible experience that was compounded by a lot of excuses. We drove over hour to this location. I attempted to order the tater tots but 5-10 minutes later the waitress Katherine B came back with a menu as i was informed that the tater tots are all gone!! Okay..I was not happy with this as this is the only thing I wanted. I did not order anything else off of the menu and was still upset that there lack of preparation resulted in me not getting a basic menu item. After about 10 minutes i talked to the waitress again and asked to speak to the manager.She informed me that she had spoken to the manager Brian and that he would be over to talk to me. My issue is why did i have to go find the waitress and ask for the manager. The manager should have been to our table earlier after she reported the issue to start with. I don't know if she reported to issue from the start or only after i asked to see the manager. Once i asked for the manager he arrived within a couple of minutes. I explained that i was not happy at all that a listed menu item was not available. I informed him that we come all the the time and have never been told that a item on the menu was not available. He then stated in a very cocky and unconcerned tone that we run out of items everyday! Wow! Well we have been coming for years and this never happened before. I then said well shouldn't the staff know there are items not available before a customer orders. \"We have over 200 plus items on the menu we can inform them on everything\" I understand i was upset but when he walked away my daughter ands my wife said that he was very arrogant and unconcerned about the issue. It felt as if he thought that i wanted something free or a discount for my wife and daughters food. He was not concerned in anyway shape or form. He just made a excuse for anything that i said. As a manager you should order the inventory and supplies needed to take care of your customers. If you make a mistake as a manager then own it and not make excuse after excuse as Brian\"The Manager\" did several times. Do i think there was another huge factor in the way i was treated? Absolutely!Its 2018 and I would think that my money and business is just as important as any other customer. Minority customers should be treated with the same respect as everyone else. This is not what we experienced today at the cheesecake factory and from Brian the manager. As i mentioned before i was bothered by his responses but when my wife and my daughter both agree that he was rude and not concerned about my issue then it's pretty much True. As a customer it's not my concern on when supplies and etc come in. As a manager you should have the skills and ability to accurately order supplies to take care of your customers and allow them to order what you have listed on the items. Don't be rude when a customer wants a certain item on the menu that you failed to properly prepare for. We expect more from the cheesecake factory and their management!",

However the manager informed us that they are out of Thai dish and said she would buy one entree for us since they ran out or maybe she would buy the cheese  cake . And then the waitress came and rushed us into another dish , bay bay or something saying it was similar just a different sauce . After serving the dish she told us that the manager would like to buy the cheese cake. But we said that she said she would buy the entree if it's different .The waitress insisted but you got the same dish . I asked how it could be the same when the sauce was different and all dishes would have chicken and some veggies . She said she would inform the manager and the manager came and checked again and asked how the dish was . My husband said I do not even know the name of the dish and that's when she agreed to buy the entree .  Long story short - they tried every way not to buy us the entree . Which would have been okay if they had not offered us in the first place . Anyways we left a nice tip for the waitress . All in all the food was amazing . Packed the cheese cake since it was already 10:30 pm when we left .",

For food, ordered a burger with no cheese, it was over cooked and had a nice pile of cheddar goo. After eating we of course ordered cheesecake but waiting another 35+ minutes just for our cheesecake we ordered as soon as our food arrived. The women's bathroom was a complete disaster!

When you walk into cheesecake if theres free seats at the bar you can sit there freely). Bartender starts telling me about how they failed the health inspection few weeks ago and how the health inspector was unnecessarily tough on them (mind you they were in the news and the health inspector caught them plating food without gloves and dead roaches under the table) so im sitting and conversing and then my food comes out. I order the chicken sandwich w/ fries.   Half way into my sandwich. LITERALLY HALF WAY lol i notice something weird is rubbing against my gum. I assume its that little weird clear hard piece of lettuce thats on burgers sometime but i feel a scrape against my mouth. So i try and spit it out (at this point the bartender is kinda looking at me to make sure im good) so i spit out an actual piece of lettuce and keep chewing and low and behold. I feel something else and i spit it out. Well what do you know. Theres a piece of wire (fiber wire from the fry basket that the manager later confirms) in my burger! The bartender watches me spit it out and gets the manager.   Seriously cheesecake factory? Id expect something like this from applebees or shoneys or some horrible place to eat like that, but you guys? Extremely shocked. Please do better. The fact that i find fiber wire in my burger is disgusting. ALSO the fact that you guys plate fold WITHOUT gloves is DISGUSTING. THATS U N S A N A T A R Y.

    "text": "To whom it may concern, Yesterday was an awesome day, as my family gathered together to celebrate a high school graduation. My nephew requested that we gather for lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. For obvious reasons, in light of the past violations found, we were hesitant  (i.e.: cockroaches ,sanitation rating,  and etc...). Moving on, we initially had no other concerns....until our waitress began disappearing for long moments of time. She was polite, but her attentiveness was lacking. She received the bare minimum for a tip... though she didn't earn one-third of it. When my aunt and my cousins food came out; the french fries were not fully cooked and the sweet potato fries were cold, the sourdough bread had been toasted and burned. They described the experience as trying to chew wood. When they experienced this failed attempt to consume their lunch.... and the waitress finally decided to show up, we asked that their meals be compted. She agreed, but offered a solution for my aunt, which was to place her meal on different bread. While they did exactly that, the condition of the sandwich once returned was not suitable for a dog. My aunt refused to eat it for obvious reasons. I took a picture...hoping to upload it, but that is clearly not  an option. My cousin lost her appetite after our long wait to eat and her experience. We then asked the waitress would she extend the courtesy of providing them with a free piece of cheesecake.... she said of course. Only later... she tried to bill them for it. This is when Eric the Manager entered into the picture. We explained the experience to him, which he then went on to insult our intelligence by informing us that it is sourdough bread, therefore that kind of bread is already hard. We know that... but this was over toasted and burned sourdough bread, so imagine how much harder it got!!!!!!!!! He also proceeded to tell us that he \"TOUCHED\" the bread and only some of it was really hard.  NOOOOO.... all of it was really hard. He did agree to give them a free piece of cheesecake, but that did not replace the sad experience of our visit. However, we thanked him... while he offered no APOLOGY!!! for the kitchen ruining their meals!!! My cousin is a chef and would have never let those meals leave the kitchen!!! This illustrates a lack of pride to serve patrons... by serving them something you yourself wouldn't eat! We were very disappointed!  Kindest Regards, THD",

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory has to be one of my favorite chain restaurants that I'm not ashamed to admit I love going to. I'm not sure if it's the fancy cocktails or the ridiculously expansive menu followed by the most decadent cheesecake, but I always feel so fancy when I come here.   This location is easy to find, but it's connected to Southpark mall so parking can be a bit of a nightmare. The inside is beautiful with cathedral ceilings, ample seating for dining, and a really nice bar area. I wish they had more seating for the waiting area because there is always a wait. If you're lucky, you can find seating at the bar and order your meal there as well.  I have a few staple favorites that are my go-to's when I come here. I love their four cheese pasta with chicken, the steak diane with salmon and potatoes, and their fried mac n cheese balls. The bread is delicious and unlimited as well. Their cocktails are also always delicious. My favorite cheesecake is the 30th anniversary with layers of cheesecake and chocolate cake topped off with ganache. NOM! I also love the regular topped with strawberries.   I would recommend eating here for the experience, but just know you will have a wait and you will spend a pretty penny, but you will leave full and satisfied!",

It was mushy and sauces were warm. The small Greek salad was drenched  spicy dressing. It ruined it! Bathrooms were dirty with no toilet paper and trash was running over. Silverware was dirty and missing some parts. Music so loud you can not hear anyone at the table. Even the waitress could not hear your order. I will never drive 57 minutes to eat here again!",

When I tell you it was busy I'm not sure I can verbally express to you how packed it was. We waited in line for 15 minutes to order our cheesecake and another half hour to actually get it. There were two guys behind the counter getting desserts together for the whole restaurant and it appeared as though they only had one speed which was between slow and snail. Once we paid our $20 for two pieces they were ill admit delectable. For the amount of time and effort we had to spend getting it however will probably have me steer clear of this place in the future.",

I went in on Labor Day at 2:00 thinking the crowd would have died down....but guess again it was freakin packed!!!  30 minute wait, which I guess in the grand scheme of Cheesecake Factory wait times wasn't too bad.  The people watching during the wait is always interesting and the massive amounts of food and cheesecake that pass me always make me wonder what kind of money this place makes.  The service was great, very attentive and friendly.  One thing I do like is the variety of food offered which is both good and bad, I guess.  We had the avocado eggrolls which are pretty tasty, I don't want to know how many calories were in them but nice chunks of avocado fried in an egg roll wrapper were complimented by a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.  I had the mushroom burger which frankly was very good.  It was well put together with very flavorful mushrooms and swiss cheese.  The cover the burger in some kind of wine sauce which was welcomed.  Fries....nasty.  Too much salt ruined them.  We skipped on the cheesecake (I know, blasphemy) but I figured I gorged on too many calories as it was and wanted to be able to look myself in the mirror afterwards.",

I had the Chicken Riesling and it was disgusting.It didn't taste like there was a drop of Riesling cooked with it.The pasta tasted like unfiltered dirty water with no salt.The meal was suppose to have bacon and caramelized onions and their was about a teaspoon of each...I ate with 5 other people and they all hated their pasta dishes as well as a dry burger on a hard crusty baguette (who eats a burger on a baguette?) and my grandmothers meal was forgotten and super late after we waited an hour after being seated to eat. Then I was charged for a top shelf drink that the waitress admitted was only worth $7 Gordon Ramsay should be a reviewer of the whole company and get the company shut down.",

The wait for a table was about 40 minutes but that was expected considering the crowd. We were seated beside an empty table and placed our order. About half an hour later a family of ten was seated beside us and we still had not received our food. We shared a waitress and she was extremely pleasant, but much more attentive to the larger party. She told us our food was coming right out three times before we got it, I honestly think she had forgotten about us. By the end of our meals, we just barely beat the other family out the door, and that's because we got our cheesecake to go. I hate to say anything bad about such a nice girl and good food, but over two hours for lunch is ridiculous.",

I liked the ambiance from my point of view in the lobby.  When we were seated... not as much.  We were tucked in this little alley off to the side of the bar that led to what I'm sure was a nicer room that looked out into the parking lot.  We couldn't see much from where we were sitting except the waiters running back and forth and the little area where they entered orders on the computer.   But I'm jumping ahead... we got there a few minutes before 7 and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  Some people coming in after us were told up to an hour and a half! I know this because the pager/beeper they give you is only active IN their lobby.  So there were about 50-70 people all standing around this lobby starring at each other and the cheesecake in the case.  Not cool.  Finally our beeper went off and then we were told to stand in a certain spot to wait for our name to be called. More waiting.  Then we were taken to our little alley table.  The menu is 21 pages long.  And then there is a Skinnylicious menu on top of that. Ridiculous.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  It was fine.  I've had better.  I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken.  It was OK. Again... I've had better. Boyfriend got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce I didn't taste it but he said it was fine but nothing he would crave again later - and that he liked another pasta dish from another restaurant much better. We each ordered a slice of cheesecake.  I got the Chocolate mouse cheesecake which I thought would be light and fluffy but no.  It was very heavy.  It was very expensive in my opinion.  We both got water, we shared an app, each had an entree and a piece of cheesecake and this came to $71 after tip.  For what we got? It was not worth it at all.   2 stars on Yelp means \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" That is exactly right in this case.  We will most definitely not be back.",

    "text": "I am sure that this is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory as far as things go.  Maybe I'm not a fan of this location or maybe I'm not a fan of this chain period, but my last few experiences here have left me disappointed.  One positive thing I can say is that they have an extensive menu.  In general, you would be hard-pressed not to find something you are in the mood to eat.    However, I've gone in there before and nothing has sounded appetizing - maybe it's just too many selections.  I can say that they have decent (but pricey) salads and I had good fish and chips from there.  I went there with a party and my boss ordered the barbecue salmon, which was WAY too salty for her. This was a day we were out to celebrate a co-worker leaving and had a party of four.  We waited almost 20 minutes to get seated, and then another 20 minutes almost before we could order.  By the time our food had arrived, we had been there over an hour.  This was lunch time, which was frustrating.  Our lunch there lasted over an hour and a half by the time we got dessert.  As far as their cheesecake goes, this has been the biggest disappointment.  It used to be you paid $8 and got huge pieces which were big enough for two to share.  However, my piece last time was about half the size it had been before.  It looks like they are trying to scale back on the sizes.  And when I thought about it, I got one of the specialty cheesecakes and so only about a third of it was actual cheesecake, and the rest of it had toppings woven in.  Not on TOP, as you would expect, but cutting into the piece of cheesecake itself.  The cheesecake part was not as good as it should have been for the price.  This location is swanky and nice, but every time I've been the service was very slow.  And since getting dessert and a lunch special was over $20 at lunch time, it seems a little too pricey for the quality of food and service you get there.  For me, \"meh\" just kind of describes how I feel about this Cheesecake Factory location.",

    "text": "I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is definitely way above par for your normal chain.  The menu is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.   The menu is also HUGE. Part of that monstrosity is advertisements (annoying!) but there really is a ton to choose from.  I have weekly (if not daily) day dreams about the Avocado Egg Rolls. Holy moly this appetizer rocks my world! Yes, it's an appetizer, but I actually order it as my entree, whoops. These rolls are chocked full of crazy amounts of flavor and texture. The middle is gooey and savory and the outside is crispy and delicious. And the dipping sauce, some sort of cilantro chutney... SHUT UP! It's amazing.  I also really enjoy the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes appetizer. These little babies are sweet and salty at the same time. Very filling. Nice presentation.  My favorite appetizer salad is the French Country Salad. Veggie friendly and delish.  The only thing I've had here I have NOT enjoyed was Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It's pretty boring and lackluster, I do not recommend.  And last but definitely not least, their namesake... the CHEESECAKES. Oh lord. Yes, It's okay to come here just for cheesecake. No one will judge you.  I would like to say I've tried them all. Unfortunately I'm in love with the Tiramisu and order it EVERY time. Except for in the fall and winter when The Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake is in season.",

The food is good and the waiters are always very attentive when we go. Best time to go is on a week day during lunch time. Weekends get crowded which is very understandable for anything attached for a mall. But we always call ahead to see what the wait time is before showing up. Don't forget to stop by the cheesecake counter or get the eggroll sampler! It's a chain so my expectations are lower than a 5 star steakhouse.",

The inside of this place is huge one of the biggest CKF I have ever been in. They are one of the better chain restaurants with one of the biggest menu's I ever seen.  It is pages upon pages of options.    The food They always start you off with some bread which is decent nothing specially but always fresh and warm which is key.  I ordered Shepards Pie yes you heard me right at CKF.  It is one of the best I have ever had.  It is my favorite comfort food and it is hard to find at most places.  It had great flavor and the portion was generous.   Staff Everyone was very friendly I have never had a bad experience at this place.  My waitress was helpful and attentive.    Verdict I am not a huge \"chain\"  guy but CKF is one of the few I would go to if I am in the area.  The food is really good and the selection is second to none.",

The floors feel greasy and dirty when I went, and I even felt like I would have slipped if I wasn't careful. You can't reserve tables which sucks for how busy that place gets. Their menu is a little too big, and the drinks are way over priced. But they do have a nice venue and the food is actually pretty good as well. Not to mention the cheesecakes are awesome.",

I even left a tip when I paid for my order at the dessert bar (which I doubt people do often) and was extra nice to the staff because I could see they were running around busy and stressed out.

Now I realize the SouthPark Mall is busy, but at 3:30pm on a Saturday I thought I would be safe. However, all the designated curb side parking spots were taken, with cars parked permanently there, not people waiting for their food. I found a nearby parking spot and called the number and after it ringing for a good 2-3 minute someone finally picked up and I said I had a pick up. I waited in my car for another 15 minutes, called again with no answer so decided to just go in. This place was chaos, after waiting another 15 min to talk to the hostess she caught someone who was going to help me. Only she walked away and I never saw her for another 10 minutes until I finally left without my meal. I don't know why this place has a curb side delivery if they can't operate it efficiently. I came from a target before, and used the same car delivery and within 2 minutes I was on my way. So this was highly frustrating and disappointing. Please remove this service if you aren't going to operate it effectively.",

    "text": "I have been to CF a number of times but I haven't been back in a while and I felt the need to write a review for my most recent visit. I had the pleasure of taking my entire family (wife and 5 children - 14, 10, 10, 7, 5) plus a 6 yo friend of my 7 yo daughter to eat at CF for my 7 year old's birthday dinner. I realize it was 7pm on a Wed night (not a weekend night), but it was still busy. So - it was crazy, to say the least - loud, annoying, yelling, constant battles between the boys, unnecessary comments and touching, eye rolls and sighs...you know the drill.  But CF and my server were FANTASTIC and handled it all with serious grace and professionalism.   Look - the food at CF is good. Very good. Yes, the Factory Burrito is flippin huge and enough for an entire village to eat. Yes, their cheesecakes are absurdly large and delish. Yes, their menu is a bit overpriced, especially some of the kids' meals. But it is truly hard to complain due to the quality of the food.  But my issues with CF in the past have almost entirely been about service. Not THIS time, however.   I got there early to get a table (b/c they still have that stupid \"no reservation\" rule, ugh). The Hostess was very nice and went out of her way to help, even making sure my name stayed at the top of the list while I waited for my family to arrive (2 cars). We were settled into a large, round booth-thing. ONE SERIOUS ISSUE - the booth's seat fabric was TERRIBLE. It was literally missing in multiple places with stuffing popping out. Unreal. It wasn't uncomfortable or anything, just VERY ugly and not what I expect for Southpark and the prices they charge.  Anyway - our server was amazing. She was constantly there, getting constant refills for my camel-like kids, never getting upset about all the yelling and things being spilled. She got our food out ASAP and was always (somehow) happy to help us with the (stupidest) requests from my children (including needing crayons to color - which she somehow found - and paper). I honestly cannot say enough about her and the rest of the staff there. THANK YOU - it was so nice to be treated with such courtesy and respect even when busy in a huge restaurant with \"difficult\" patrons.",

To start off, my other and I each ordered a cocktail. Mine came maybe 10 minutes after ordering it but it took my other's close to 30 minutes to receive his drink. And that was after complaining. Apparently the bar ran out of one of the ingredients required to make his drink but the bartender just didn't have time to go grab it from storage..... we also placed an order for the chicken samosas, the loaded tots and the cheeseburger egg rolls. 30 minutes after placing our food order we finally received the cheeseburger egg rolls and the crab cake bites.... (what??????). That is when we found out that they were out of the tots... the waitress never came back to tell us about the tots being sold out and just decided to bring us something else?? Finally our samosas came and as she was bringing them to our table, half of them, including the sauce came flying off the plate and splattered all over the ground. Needless to say, this experience has reminded me why I haven't been here in years and definitely do not plan on coming back again.",

You just have to go in expecting to wait when you get there for a table and again waiting for the food.  They have an extensive menu which I have tried a lot of, but Kevin and I have found the two dishes that we love and get every single time!  When we have a gift card, we usually get each dish, but if we don't, we usually get the combo, as these two dishes also come as a combo.  Great amount for us to share!  We of course love it when we have a gift card so that we can have it for multiple nights!  What are the dishes?  Chicken madeira and steak Dianne!  Both the chicken and steak are awesome.  We love the potatoes too!  If you get the chicken madeira, ask for extra sauce on the side because it is fantastic to pour on the mashed potatoes!  We are full by the time we are done, so we always take our cheesecake to go.  Can't go there without getting cheesecake as it is awesome and cheesecake is my favorite!  My favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the apple streusel, which we happened to get both of those this time.  Normally we try out different ones each time, they have some other good ones as well.  I am disappointed that they got rid of my favorite a couple years ago - the oreo cheesecake, but now they have the oreo dream extreme, I've had it once, but just give me an entire oreo cheesecake rather than all the chocolate richness in the cake and other layers!  We will be back!  (PS we are now out of giftcards, anyone who wants to give us one we will be happy to take ;-D )",

Upon getting \"beeped\" I approached the front counter where I was confronted with YOUR POLICY that made YOUR HOSTESS RUDE. She informed me that \"policy\" said we could not be seated because all 6 of us were not there. Two were at the bar closing out our check and one was in the mall because as a 73 year old, he needed to sit. YOU do not have anywhere near the seating needed for waiting guests.  Are you kidding? Do you really expect everyone to be there immediately upon beeping after three long hours? My lord, I wonder why the fire marshals have not ordered you to clear the doorway of scores of people waiting to be seated. Your food staff had huge difficulty navigating the immense crowd. Think guest safety. When Saturday night crowds are big and it is 10 degrees outside, perhaps you can isolate a better waiting area.  Everything about The Cheesecake Factory gets high marks but not your corporate policies or customer accommodation  (therefore the 2 stars as an average for food vs. \"policy\"). It is a very selfish attitude that causes customer-staff friction and it is needless. Yes, it spoiled our meals and left a sour taste that even you cheesecake can not remove.",

We started with Tuna Tartare, which was beautifully presented and very fresh. We loved it, and it was a nice diversion from some of their \"not so healthy\" appetizers. For lunch, I ordered my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the S.O. ordered teriyaki chicken. Both were excellent! Our server was awesome and we really had a great lunch with several drinks.

Only good thing was my White Russian and the over priced small price of cheese cake. Then the manager didn't even comp our ticket or any thing. Not that I'm cheep out of being a good business to make some one want to come back if your ever in South Park Charlotte don't come here.

Our server lacked attentiveness. I fully understand being busy; but she definitely made a judgment call and decided our table didn't merit as much attention as other tables. Our food was not hot and had no flavor (I ordered a chicken avocado club). I informed the server and she shrugged, complained about the kitchen and then went back to her other tables. At no point did she make any offers regarding our poorly prepared food. However, she gave the table next to is free cheesecake because they had the same issue. Look, I don't need free cheesecake, but I expect you to acknowledge a complaint about my meal. She then failed to ask us if we needed anything else.  Instead, she brought our checks and moved on. Poor service. I tipped her more than I should have (she deserved a penny, but I gave 10%). I live in the Southpark area and will never return there. Also, it took over 2 hours from start to finish. What's worse? I am still hungry because I did not eat my abysmal food.",

I mean seriously our waiter today had an attitude problem, let out a huge gasp when we returned our stuffed mushrooms because of how pathetic they looked. Flat, barley any stuffing, like he's annoyed of the fact we are returning it? I'm annoyed because I love them and they just always suck at this location. White rice with my dish, so over cooked and mushy. Last time the rice was hard and undercooked. Shepard pie once here was like a soup, we returned it. I was served salmon once that was burned to a crisp, the person serving was like \"yes I'd return that too\" so then don't bring it out!!! This location is just not the same quality you can get at other locations and I've been to about 5 different ones nationwide. This is my favorite restaurant up in MA-the natick location. But here in Charlotte it's very disappointing. Corporate please send some secret diners in to see how bad it is here!",

    "text": "Best chain ever.  Yes, it's a chain and yes there's tons of local eats, but I argue that there is no place where a party of 20 people can get everything they're looking for, no matter what they like, what dietary restrictions they have and what they're in the mood for.  The mood lighting at night is great for a romantic dinner that isn't too intimate (no pressure!) or a nightcap and cheesecake (sexy!). The hours are later than most other places in the area, too, so if you're running to grab a bite after a movie or something, the Factory is a great option.  I tend to battle between getting the Thai Lettuce Wraps (fresh, quality, delish!) and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, no cucumbers, but almost always get both because I can't stop myself. Sure it's way too much food but these are things that I sometimes DREAM about. And sure there are vietnamese and thai places that carry the lettuce wraps in town but I've tried and every time I'm left yearning for that tamarind cashew sauce.   BRB, drooling. ---------------  And, I'm back! So yes, the service is always attentive but the waits can be long, especially at peak dinner hours and all day Saturday & Sunday during mall hours. The bar is fully stocked, bathrooms always clean (and posh!), and the outdoor patio makes for a pretty nice summer lunch spot too. They've got a bar bites menu that's available to keep it light on the pockets, and of course more cheesecakes than should be legal to tempt you into ordering just 1..... ok, 2 slices.",

    "text": "I have to say, first, that the customer service that I received at The Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond, definitely.  My server was excellent and after an issue with a dish, the manager who visited my table also went way beyond what most would have bothered with, in particular since it's The Cheesecake Factory and losing one customer would seemingly not be a big deal, since I arrived at 5:15 on a Thursday evening to a packed house.    I haven't been to the Factory in years.  I don't like going to the mall and I don't like waiting an inordinate amount of time to be seated.  I had a craving for cheesecake, so I made a run here after work.  Since it's attached to SouthPark mall, there seems to never be any down time at all.  Even upon my early arrival I had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  No biggie, I was seated within 5 or so minutes and instantly greeted by my server, Bonnie, who was absolutely fantastic.  She had her hands full and the section was completely booked, but she did a fantastic job.  I heard a table near me compliment how well she did, after she returned to thank them for what I assume was an extra-large tip.  The food: Fried cheese sticks:  6 triangles.  Thick breading, nice melty cheese.  Marinara that was served with was meh.  Tasted weird, kind of plain, but nothing offensive.   Fried chicken salad:  When they first opened this location, this was my go-to order.  Huge \"normal\" salad with fried chicken on top of it.  In the many years it has been since my last visit, the recipe has changed and I was not a fan of the new way.  The menu said \"mixed greens\" and I forgot that kale is no longer just a garnish.  Too much kale, way too much kale.  But the fried chicken served with it was quite good, as was the corn and pecans with the honey mustard dressing.  I picked through the salad, but it was mostly kale, so I just ate the chicken.  My server noticed and said she would bring me something else, but I told her it was my misunderstanding, no big deal, I ate all of the chicken and a few pieces of lettuce and that was fine.   Turtle cheesecake:  Eh.... it was okay.  Creamy cheesecake with a healthy swirl of whipped cream.  Large dollop of a thick chocolate cream on top, plenty of nuts.  It was fine.    The server let the manager (I believe he said his name was Johann) know about the salad and he came by the table and told me that had been taken off of my bill.   I told him as well that it wasn't necessary as I ate all of the chicken and what I could of the salad.  He again said it was taken care of and if I had any other problems to let him know.  Very nice and totally unexpected.  Excellent customer service.  I don't know when I will return, but the great job by my waitress and the manager on duty definitely left a very positive reflection on the place, I just wish the food was as good as the staff.",

On my way to Virginia over the holidays, we drove through Charlotte specifically so that we could go to CF.    This location of CF is by far, the best I have ever been.  We had an awesome booth all the way in the back (read -- away from all the noise).  Our server was friendly and helpful.   The food at this location was great!  Hot, huge portions and there was no skimping when we asked for extra sauce for our dishes (a must if you are a sauce freak like we are).  My daughter had her usual farfalle pasta (chicken, mushrooms, peas and some other stuff) and I had the chicken madeira (chicken, mozzarella, madeira sauce, asparagus and smashed taters).  It was all soooooooooooooo delicious!!    We ordered one cheesecake -- the banana -- which is served with freshly sliced bananas.  It's now my second favorite to the lemon with raspberry glaze.    When CF comes to Baton Rouge or New Orleans, my life will be complete.  Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I will be stupendously thrilled.  My recommendations --  Thai lettuce wraps (enough for a meal or appetizer to share) and then something from the specialties page, pasta or salad.  Skip the stuff that you can get anywhere any day of the week (burger).",

    "text": "The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is somewhat overwhelming in it's size and breadth.  While it's a lot to take in, the menu also offers pretty much something for anyone so, it's a nice destination for a large group who can't agree on a particular genre of food for the night.  Definitely enjoy the avocado egg roll appetizer.  Fresh, ripe avocado mixed with some diced tomato, red onion...  They are quite good.  As far as their namesake dish, cheesecake, I'm not that big a fan.  Not much of a dessert fan but I do love a good slice of cheesecake and find the Factory's to be a little to fluffy in texture for my tastes.  I prefer something more dense.  They have a large the selection of flavors however and my wife swears by the \"Dulce de Leche\" version.  For a drink, if you're going non-alcoholic, I like their lemonade a lot.  Fresh and tart.  Definitely not Country Time!",

The meatloaf was also burnt like it was recooked and drinks were not satisfactory. In efforts to have orders corrected our waitress copped an attitude because our table wasn't satisfied. We were visiting from Pittsburgh and this would have never been acceptable there or anywhere else. Needless to say we will not be back to this South Park location.",

    "text": "I want to preface this review by admitting I didn't want to come here and I don't like chain restaurants like this, but someone we were going out to eat with really wanted to go here.  The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast.  We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why...  I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.    We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part.  Overall, it was pretty much what I expected from a place like this.",

We were called 15 mins exactly.  I had the chicken salad sandwich, I am extremely picky about chicken salad.  It was good, I ate most of it, but it wasn't exceptional, but to make up for that it was a huge portion and they did not skimp on the quantity of white chicken meat.  The fries were just fries, I think I ate 2.  They did mess up our son's order:  soft tacos with only meat and cheese, everything else on the side.  When they arrived with thinly shredded lettuce throughout the tacos, our waiter pretty much suggested we pull them out. You CANNOT pull out shredded lettuce from a taco...  He did take them back but it took a very long time to replace.  The quality of the taco meat was good though, not the normal ground generic beef.  The mixed drinks looked good, but my husband and I just had a draft beer (only 3 or 4 to choose from, but good choices) bc we were getting ready to spend ALL day shopping in the South Park mall.   I don't mind spending money for exceptional food, but I thought this was just a little over priced for the quality and service.  We would probly go back, but mainly bc the kids loved it so much, not for the quality of the food or value.",

They seated us at a two top bench seat in the bar area. At first this seemed fine but 10  minutes later the hostess started setting up the table next to us (the tables were about 12 inches apart) with 2 highchairs and a booster seat then seated 2 couples with 3 small children. They were not happy being squeezed into a bench seat with the highchairs etc. but even after they complained to the waitress and the hostess, the hostess seemed unable to come up with a solution.  Seems they could have just moved them to a table where they could move the chairs to accomodate the highchairs.  The menu is overwhelming.  I'm always a little suspicious of a menu with so many items.  I feel like more often than not, everything just ends up being okay and nothing is really good.  My sister ended up getting the burrito and I got the bbq chicken salad.  The burrito was the biggest portion of food I've ever seen in a restaurant.  It could have easily fed 4 adults.  I could only eat about 1/3 of the salad and it was the lunch portion.  The food was good, not great.  The service was good.  I would go again but would request a table, not a bench seat.",

    "text": "Well. so I decided to be a bit generous with my rating because after all, the food was good, the cheesecake was great, and the atmosphere (outdoor) patio was amazing.  PROS Evelyn's favorite pasta has now become my favorite pasta. I could not eat it all and I took the remaining home....can I tell you the leftovers tasted BETTER than straight out of the kitchen!!! The Mac and cheese was pretty tasty. I'd get it again. This was my first try at the tiramisu cheesecake, and just like the actual tiramisu,I loved it. The bread, loved loved loved it...I am a \"brown bread\" fan for sure. CF even won my son, who is not a bread eater, over. Wish we had been offered more since it did take quite a bit of time for our entrees to arrive. We chose a perfect day to be outside on the patio although it was a rather warm day, the fans were sufficient and made outdoor eating quite pleasant. We even had a \"little friend\" stop by to say Hi (see the picture).   CONS The service is super slow . Perhaps with it being beautiful Saturday, servers decided to take the day off? My biggest CON....lack of attention to detail.  The hostess gave us our flatware wrapped in a WHITE napkin and I had on BLACK pants!!!!! Please take note of the importance of NOT giving someone wearing BLACK a WHITE napkin (thus the reason a star was lost).   Overall, great time, great food, and amazing company. We'll be back. Looking forward to my next review and I am going to wear black JUST to see if you all are paying attention .  Until next time....",

The food is pretty delicious and flavorful, considering the portions are enough for 2-3 people and over 1,500 calories for the heavier meals. The variety of cake flavors is what sets this place apart from nearby bakeries/cakeries. I have experienced the best of service to the worst of service such as a waitress spilling a full cup of ice water on me and not giving a damn or properly cleaning up the table, and/or just yesterday waiting for 30 mins to order 6 cheesecakes to go and them giving me only 5 and not giving me the correct cake initially. They only had one freaking job !!! And the cakes are already premade ! The flow of how the employees move is rigid and extremely inefficient. How do you have waiters with huge orders wait in line like everyone else? Are you serious? The lady at the bartender was probably the most effective employee there when she quickly gave me some water despite the kajillion drinks she had to make before and after my request. Shape up your employees' sense of urgency and accuracy and more people won't be so turned off by your customer service.",

In that time waiting the server came by only once to tell us the food was arriving but it still took 20 minutes. My friend ordered her steak medium but when she cut into it it was rare. Almost blue. By that time the server did not come again to check on us. My salad was virtually tasteless as very little dressing was used.

First off, we got seated at this super tiny table that basically almost touched the tables next to us. How are you even supposed to fit more than 1 plate on this tiny table?? Anyways, I ordered a blood orange margarita that came in a martini glass which was a bit odd. I liked that there was no ice, but I was so confused as to why it came in a martini glass. Secondly, our bread which should have came with our appetizer or before, came to us during dinner. We asked for more bread but our waitress forgot. By the time we could have reminded her, it was too late because we were both full with our meals and were ready for dessert. Third, our waitress mixed up our check with another table who ordered like 5 cheesecakes and the most expensive things on the menu. Luckily we told our waitress right away, but after she realized she gave us the wrong check, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to receive another one because she went to go track down the couple who got our check. And lastly, it was SOOOO COLD. It's smack dab in the middle of the winter, what is the need for 30 degree temperatures inside the restaurant?! I didn't take my heavy winter jacket off for the 2 hours we were sitting there. So unnecessary.   I will not be back.",

I ordered the piccata and it was tasty. Only complaint I had was we were sat in the bar area where you sit on a long bench with chairs . We were sat about 6 inches from another couple and it was like we were sitting with them and we had to sit and listen to them smack and make gross noises while they ate . And we also couldn't get up til they left .. they had scooted the little table right up to ours and we couldn't squeeze through the spot... it was awkward and I didn't enjoy that. I'll be sure to request that we Don't sit in that area anymore ...",

All the staff I encountered were pleasant and my waitress was very good.  I ordered the pepperoni pizza, which was thin crust.  It tasted really good, but  I prefer a crispy crust.  If your style is the floppy New York Pizza style, you will really enjoy it.  For dessert I had the strawberry shortcake.  I will not order it again, as the cake part is actually biscuits, hard biscuits.  Maybe if it was a lighter fluffier biscuit I would have enjoyed it.  They did have a skinny side menu, which I thought was nice.   10/19/18",

But that doesn't stop us from coming once in a while. I can't believe I have never written a review for this restaurant. My husband and I care to pick up cheesecake last night. We tried their new flavors. My husband had the Banana Cream and I had the Cherry Ghirardelli. Both were great. The 3 stars was for the hour wait it took us to get our 2 slices to go. (BTW... No that's not how my slice came. I took a bite and realized I should take a picture lol. My husband ate his too quickly so it's not pictures.)",

    "text": "It is amazing how inefficiently run this establishment is. I honestly believe the reason why this place has an extensive wait is because they do not know how to function efficiently. Sure, the food is good, and their menu has something for everyone, but that won't keep people coming back when their service is so terribly slow and poorly run.   Tonight was just a night to come in a get a slice of to-go cheesecake. Not a sit down meal, but just a cheesecake slice from the counter, boxed up to enjoy at home (as they were on a three hour wait at 8pm). I was able to walk up, choose my two slices from the counter and pay in record time, and was informed it would be about five minutes. Well, fast forward 40, that's right FORTY, minutes, I was still standing there, waiting for my to-go cheesecake. There were at least 6 employees behind the counter, but maybe 3 doing work. When my name was finally called, I gladly accepted my order, then stepped away to check it. Well, one of my cheesecakes was wrong, so back to the counter I went, where I was informed, rather rudely, that it would be about 20 minutes for my correct slice....that I could still see, sitting in the case. Rather than waiting, I just took the cheesecakes and left.   I'm not sure the deliciousness of the cheesecakes can counter the amazingly poor experience I just went through.",

I love their food but I hate that you can't make a reservation, the waits is alway forever, and the portion is alway so damn big.  On the cold Sunday, it's no different. We were excited to have brunch at Cheesecake. Arrived at 12:30. Didn't get seated til 1:45pm but our waitress couldn't take our orders til after 2pm so we missed our brunch deadline! So I opted for small plates of chicken samosas and the crab cakes balls. Both were very salty. Therefore, I couldn't finish it. My usual herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes was great. The kids love their options. All in all. Service was great. Our food took a long time to get to us as usual due to how busy they are. And it's nothing new there. But again, our server was doing the best she can!",

    "text": "While in town I wanted to treat my mother to a lovely dinner because she had never dined at this franchise before. I had been years earlier with friends of mine and I said that time I had to have my mother try this place as well. I told her she would be in store for a great treat and that's what she got.  As we entered this place to put our name the list for a table, the line was out the door and there were many patrons sitting outside in the nice sitting area for there name to be called as well. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table. That was fine since we didn't have anywhere in particular to go this Saturday afternoon.   The 30 minutes came and went fast by us people watching others going in and coming out of the mall. Once we turned in our buzzer it was still a 5 minute wait to get seated still. We finally were placed in a busy, small corner of the restaurant by the hostess. This was cool because it was just 2 of us and enough space for both of us.  Our waitress came and introduced herself within minutes of us sitting down. We looked over the menu for awhile. After bringing our drinks the waitress informed us that she was leaving for the day and another waitress would handled us from here on out. This was fine as long as we still got top notch service.  The menu was filled with all kinds of things, chicken, pasta, hamburgers, and things like that. I had a very hard trying to choose what I wanted to eat. It was either the Parmesan chicken or the Seafood pasta. I ended up choosing the chicken and my mother chose the 'glamburger'. Both were great choices. My dish came with 3 chicken breasts, green beans, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were out of this world!!!!! They were absolutely amazing. The chicken and green beans were good but I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. My mother enjoyed her hamburger and fries. It was a pretty big burger too. We both had tons to take home.   Then came the dessert!!! How could you go to this restaurant and not order cheesecake?!?!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but I do love a Strawberry cheesecake and that's what I got and my mother ordered the Key Lime cheesecake. Only complaint I have about my cheesecake is the bottom crust. I didn't particularly care of it but the rest was delicious.  My mother really enjoyed this little dinner we had!!! I'm so glad that I was able to have her dine here with me for the first time!!! I'm sure this won't be her last because she is now HOOKED!!!! I'm sure she would want me to take care of the tab again also!!!! LOL!!!!",

    "text": "Spoiler Alert!!! I didn't have cheesecake! I know! I know!   I used to love Cheesecake Factory. I mean I would find any excuse to go here...but after a while things changed, the food was different and I stopped going. And then my friends came to visit from Virginia and where did they wanna go????  Our good old standby...of course!   And here we go:  Drinks:  My favorite for a long time has been their Georgia Peach. Vodka, Peach liquor swirled with raspberries and topped with a mint leaf so it looks like a peach in a glass. Perfect! Always delicious, and most certainly expect to order two! Mmmmmm!   Appetizers: We ordered the wings without the sauce. They were okay. A little dry but we just doused them in blue cheese and ranch. There are plenty of other options so unless you're craving wings try something else. We also ordered the Buffalo Blasts. Now these things are freaking delicious! It's chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce stuffed in a wonton and fried. You can always sign me up for anything with the words \"fried, chicken and cheese\" in the description. They were ahhhhmazing! Crispy on the outside juicy flavorful meat stuffed on the inside (and they are not stingy with the filling) served hot with ranch dressing...like Nike says Just Do It! You can thank me later!   Dinner:  I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. It comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus over a lemon sauce. I'm a huge fan of the lemon sauce (always ask for extra) but last night the salmon just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, portion size was not the issue. But it was just very bland. The potatoes are chunky with pieces of the red skin, not a favorite for me but that's just my personal preference. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and dipped in the lemon sauce....simply divine!   Overall, the meal was just okay. Nowhere near as good as I used to remember but not bad by any means. I'm sure I'll be back...and yes I'll make sure to get a piece of cheesecake.",

I've been an avid Cheesecake Factory fan for years but now I realize why I never compliment the service.   The food is amazing as well as their fantastic cheesecakes. There's a large variety so there really is a little something for everyone.  However, I've come to realize that I have the same issues almost every time I come as far as the amount of time I'm waiting on food/service.   Today I happened to want to surprise my family with some cheesecake and tried calling ahead numerous times to put in a to go order and no one picked up the phone. I understood and shrugged thinking that it must be busy. I am a server and working in the food/restaurant industry has given me a very forgiving perspective. Come to find that when I walk in the door, it is completely dead and the hostess is letting the phone ring nonstop without picking it up.   Now this could be the hostess' fault for ignoring her duties and I will always come back for the food--but I urge Cheesecake Factory to put their employees to be the absolute best they can be.",

I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich...and a few minutes later the water told me they are out of the bread it comes on, so I needed to order something else. I asked if I could just have it on a different type of bread and he said no. Apparently, the ingredients are \"pre-measured\" for the type of bread it goes on....WHAT?!?!? Just change the damn type of bread! If a kitchen can not just make the sandwich fit on a different bread, we have problems. So, I ordered the chicken avocado club, and it was decent. Chicken was cooked well, fries and ranch were very good. Husband got the lunch shepherd pie and he said it was good as well. I'd suggest skip it for food (it's a chain...I mean, it is what it is), and just go for cheesecake.",

You could get something spectacular one night and order the same dish again the next night and not get the same quality.  I went there with the lady and another couple to celebrate achievements on all of our parts. The girls ordered drinks, which they thoroughly enjoyed.  And then the food came out.  I ordered...uh... some jamaican jerk thing? With chicken instead of shrimp? Jeez, it's so hard to remember when the menu is that big. I'm sure that there are a bunch of jamaican jerk things with chicken. But this one had beans and a mango pineapple salsa! And plantains!  The chicken was excellent, the slaw was good (but room temp, not cold), the beans were okay (they lacked seasoning), and the yucca was seriously overcooked. I was with my Irish buddy who had never seen plantains before and he asked me if I ordered shit (yes, they were that charred and shriveled. I gotta say, I don't blame him). However, it's really hard to mess up the internal flavor of a plantain, and overall, it was fine.  The lady ordered Fish Tacos, and she was not pleased. But I can't blame her, they had soaked the damn thing is so much sauce that the actual tortilla broke when she tried to pick it up because it was too saturated. She said it also lacked any flavor, though I didn't try it.  The cheesecake IS consistently wonderful though. I do wish they gave a weeee bit bigger slices, but what can you do.   I do enjoy coming here, I really do, but... it never turns out to be as good as I think it's going to be. Phew. Feels good to get that off my chest.",

The Factory doesn't take reservations, so that's how it goes. Our server, Kenneth, was extremely enthusiastic, although he kept referring to my counterpart as \"m'lady,\" which was pretty great and also slightly emasculating. I ordered salad with my burger but got fries; whatever, the fries were great, and there was enough ketchup for both the burger and the fries, which is SUCH a rarity at places without self-serve ketchup. She got pasta, which was also really good, and we shared a Turtle cheesecake. \"I mean, the place is called the Cheesecake Factory. We ought to get some cheesecake.\" Everything was marvelous, as expected. Side note, the floor beside our table was really slippery, and we almost fell a few times. Other than that, it was a great way to close out 2013.",

The cheesecake is fresh and beautifully decorated.  They use the best ingredients and eating this dessert makes you feel decadent and special.  We were expecting the same from The Cheesecake Factory in South Park.  It didn't come close.  The dessert was stale and tasted as if they had make it from a box mix.   I don't mind paying $10.00 for a slice of cheesecake if it's baked by hand from scratch.  This was neither.

    "text": "Hi Cheesecake Factory I like you but I'm not in love with your crazy wait times, or giant sized portions. Your place looks pretty cool though, I like high ceilings, and I can appreciate the sizable outdoor patio area, but can we get tables that are a bit bigger please? It's really crowded!  Adjoined to Southpark Mall is the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory. Every time I go for a shopping spree I see tons of people waiting their turn to get into this place like an exclusive nightclub and people leaving with bags of food. So I finally decided to try it out after a shopping spree one day. The place feels very cavernous walking in with super high ceilings and some paintings to gaze at as you're looking up wondering how much their power bill costs. Well then the waiting game begins, first we checked in to the hostess station and was told there will be about 45 minutes wait which turned out to be about an hour, okay no big deal I thought. Turns out the buzzer thing they gave me was to announce that I could now wait in the shorter line to actually be seated! What a tease!  So now we're finally seated and hungry looking at the huge menu. Some bread came out I guess to sate your hunger a bit from waiting an hour+ to get a seat. I ordered a frozen mango smoothie and appetizers took that took a while to come out by this time I'm wishing they gave me some more bread. The spicy ahi tempura roll that came out is huge and delicious but not spicy at all. Then came the main courses which actually came out on time! I had ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and was totally unprepared for the size of this thing. I mean seriously it would have taken 4 meals for me to finish this thing off, it was very delicious though! The sudden influx of food at once left me feeling really bloated though so we opted for taking dessert home and bought a tiramisu cheesecake for later.  I've probably rambled on too much at this point so I'll just summarize. Come prepared to be hungry in 1-2 hours and not while you're actually hungry. Prices are a bit high for the type of food but they give you enough food for 3-4 meals. I just don't really understand this place the food is nice but I there are plenty of dining options around this area where you don't have to wait for 2 hours. If they took reservations I'd probably be here more.",

Portions were decent and prices were about what you would expect. I got the Garlic Noodles with chicken and was surprised to find bones in the chunks of chicken they put on.

The interior is nicely decorated, but it felt very dim when I in to eat.  I'd prefer a little more lighting there for some reason.  I thought that they could have someone make the bathroom a little cleaner though.  When I went in on Sunday, I was seated at a big circle booth.  I thought that was very cool so our group could talk and jabber a lot, but if someone had to use the bathroom, two or three people would have to get up to let someone out of the booth.    Now to the food.  The only good thing really worth it on the appetizer menu would be the sweet corn tomale.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  I tried the other appetizers from friends and thought they just tasted alright.  Nothing too snazzy.  The entrees weren't really something to die for.  The strawberry lemonade though, whew!  ALWAYS order that sweet deliciousness with a free refill.  Even during the winter it makes me think of a nice hot summer day.  I would suggest everyone to come here for the cheesecake though since it is called \"The Cheesecake Factory.\"  Sometimes I have stopped by, only for the delightful sweets.

I just think that if you're looking for a nice place to eat there are MUCH better options that something attached to the South Park Mall.    The wait is always atrocious and even when you do have reservations it's doubtful that you'll actually get seated on time.  The food is overpriced for the quality you are getting.  The waitstaff is nice but they are busy because the place is enormous.  The atmosphere is corny.  I can't think of any other way to describe it.  Do yourself a favor and take a look around when you walk in there.  Stop being a stereotypical American and go eat at an independently owned shop.  My bet is you will be much happier, eat about 2,000 less calories, and get out the door for a heck of a lot cheaper!  If you really need a piece of cheesecake - get it to go.",

    "text": "Come for the cheesecake and stay for...well, the cheesecake.  We ate at The Cheesecake Factory one busy Saturday evening.  The wait was an hour, which was really no biggie because, hey, you've got a huge mall behind TCF to browse through!  I was thinking to myself, \"This place is so crowded it HAS to be good, right?\"  WRONG!  From the perpetually pissy server to the horrible main dishes, this was one of the worst experiences we ever had at a restaurant, bar none.  The only thing that WAS good was the thing they are famous for, the cheesecake.  Of course none of us found that out until hours later; the food had made us all so sick we had to take our cheesecakes to go!  Next time I waste my time coming to this place I'll know to grab my cheesecake and RUN!  Run far, run fast!  Mickey D's has the food at this place beat.  The ONLY thing that got stars was the deliciousness of dessert.  The service and food both get a big, fat ZERO!",

Wandered the mall, returned for pager, waited about 45 min. for a table,    Friendly staff.  We were told that we could order at the to-go counter and eat outside on the patio.  We wanted to experience the restaurant.  Loved the atmosphere!  Very relaxing.  Excellent service.  Wonderful dessert and coffee.  Had the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake.  Hubby had Chocolate Mousse Cheese Cake.  Only had a few crumbs left.  Had eated dinner at Maggiano's...feel of the resturant was totally different.  Both had 2 hour waits, both were extremely crowded.  BUT Cheesecake Factory had a much more relaxed atmosphere.  Wait staff was not stressing out...calm, joking with each other, etc.  Lovely experience.  Wish they took reservations.",

First, I cannot get over the fact that this place tries to pass itself off as fancy (valet parking, for example) when it is a) called \"The Cheesecake Factory\" and b) ATTACHED TO A MALL--arguably two of the least fancy things imaginable.    The inside of this place is basically a glorified cafeteria--just a loud din of noise, which makes it even crazier that people dress up to go here. The food itself (even that which is not cheesecake related) is incredibly caloric and fattening.  I spent most of my life trying to avoid this place, and, I realized today, for good reason--this place is just thoughtless excess at its finest.",

Sure the space is pretty grand and offers a nice atmosphere, but the menu is gigantic and it's almost dizzying how they make you wait, rush you in, and then you can't even remember what you ate....  Yes they do make good cheesecake and it's a treat... it's also very filling... most of their portion sizes seem like they are trying to feed 2 or 3 people with each plate.  This could have been a fluke because they are always so busy, but last time I came in I just wanted to get a gift card and the hostess was very rude and told me to get them from the cashier [ with a tone that I should have known that in the first place ].  I'll let it roll off for now, but I would hire people that have more patience to be at the front of the house.",

    "text": "This  CF location has gone down in the last year or so. We have noticed several service issues, especially when dining in the bar area.  At our last outing, our server took almost 10 minutes to come to the table after we sat down to greet us, pass out menus and take drink orders. She was slow to bring drinks, didn't bring a side salad that was requested before the meal. The food was subpar, and they totally botched my order by giving me the wrong dish.  Everyone's food also arrived lukewarm, like it had been sitting for a while.  We did address it with the manager who was apologetic and discounted the bill. We were treating an out of town guest who had never been to CF before and were totally embarrassed that we had brought him here. We walked out thinking we should have gone somewhere else in the South Park area. Eating out is becoming more and more of a luxury and it is disappointing when you got out expecting a nice dining experience and  get bad service and bad food. We will not be returning to CF anytime soon and I can no longer recommend it.  UPDATED :10/13/14- After making a complaint on the the company website regarding the above visit, we were sent a $25 e Gift  card. We redeemed the card at brunch  about a week a ago and had a good meal and great service. We intentionally sat in the restaurant, not the bar area. I don't know if I would ever have meal service in the bar area again. IMHO the servers are better trained in the restaurant area than those that serve in the bar area.",

This particular location feels too large, like I felt like I was getting lost in my booth b/c the place was so large.   The food was on par with what I have come to expect from this chain, but it was the service that warrants the deduction in stars. Throughout our experience the service was fine- not particularly good, not particularly bad- but that all changed as we were getting ready to leave.   I had asked for a box (b/c the portions are just too large here) and was in the process of placing my leftovers into said box when the waitress came back after running our credit card. As I still had my hand on my plate, picking at the last few fries that did not fit in the box, she swopped in and took the plate from me. Really???? This took a middle of the road experience and turned it sour.",

I'm surprised it didn't have mold on it.  My wife ordered the ham and cheese omelet.  The cheese was cooked to a crisp...it resembled peanut brittle.  She actually sent it back because it was nasty.  The waitress agreed it was overcooked and placed an order for another one.  The second one took so long we just cancelled our order.  In the time we waited I asked for a water more than three times.  When we left one of my kids left a bag under the chair with a toy in it.  We returned a few minutes later and my wife asked a waiter if he had seen the bag.  He said \"we already threw it in the trash and threw the trash in the dumpster.\"  Assuming the guy just didn't want to look for it she said \"so you can't get it back?\" He said \"what do you want me to do, go dumpster diving?\"  Besides the fact the waiter was a complete jerk I'm shocked they managed to empty the trash 100x faster than they could deliver the food we ordered.  I will not be going back to the Cheesecake Factory!  Unbelievably bad experience.",

We asked a lot of questions I mean a lot and she answered all of them and was very patient. We eat out way too much and this was the best service we have had in a long time. I'm done.

I didn't complain the second time, the third time the coke was brought, the glass was so dirty I was disgusted to have drunk out of it.

As stated in another review the wait staff was indeed \"stuffy\", but that's ok. The Resturant decor is beautiful. We both had a drink,mixed to perfection. I decided to have the Ahi tuna Tatar appetizer, and we split a slice of 30th anniversary pie. The tuna was 1-3/4\" of avocado with 4 pieces of tuna, no bigger then the end of my little finger, on top. But that's ok. The Resturant is beautiful. The pie was the real hit, and was enjoyed to the last crumb. The bill for two drinks, 1 appetizer, and 1 slice of pie $38. When we left the Resturant we both busted out laughing. We couldn't imaging what the bill would have been if we had eaten lunch. By the way a slice of pie is just under $9.00. A whole pie is $$50.00. Again the Resturant decor is beautiful.",

Staff most of the time are tentative, occasionally there are times when service is slow, but that's expected with high volume locations.   Most definite recommendation. The menu is overwhelming, and I'll need to try more to get a better understanding overall, but so far everything has enough taste to keep coming back.",

    "text": "This used to be my absolute favorite go to restaurant for the last several years. Anytime we had a special occasion we have always gone to the cheesecake factory. My birthday is January 28 and we went there to eat Sunday the 29th. To give them credit it was an insanely busy day, but that was no excuse for the horrific tasting food that they put in front of me. I ordered the sweet corn tamales and I've never ordered anything else there because those are my absolute favorite things. The plate was scolding hot the food was stone cold it tasted horrible even my guests tasted it and couldn't believe how nasty it was.  One of my friends ordered the cheeseburger with bacon on it and macaroni and cheese and ordered it medium-well... it came out about as raw as steak tartare!!!! They brought her burger then eventually they brought her bacon and even later they finally brought her fries. She ordered ranch dressing to go with her fries and it tasted awful. She's just a young girl and she was so embarrassed and thought she had done something wrong because her meals so bad that my insisted they take it off my tab. Her mother ordered the chicken Parmesan with carrots and mashed potatoes. She said it was actually quite good except that the carrots or better and not at all what she expected from the description on the menu.  All in all, we were there for four hours from the time we sit down at our table until the time that we finally were able to leave.   Our meal was handled so poorly by the manager that I decided to find a new favorite place for my birthday. This actually makes me quite sad, but I can always order takeout cheesecake, and I found a copycat recipe for my sweet corn tamales. So if I really want them that bad I'll make them myself.  Our waitress was actually quite good, it just wasn't her fault that the food was coming out slowly and was not prepared correctly. She was delightful and really tried hard to keep us from getting out of sorts.",

    "text": "My wife and I have never really had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory at SouthPark Mall. Wait staff has always been on point and very attentive. Several times our servers have informed us on options that we were not previously aware of such as paying our bill through the iPhone App, new available Cheesecake options, and even pointing us to the bar for their happy hour specials.   I would give this location a five star rating but there is one issue I have, consistency. The last couple of times we have gone to do the happy hour in the bar area, our apps that were ordered were different in taste each time. My favorite app are the potstickers, but I ordered them three times and all three time they were different. One time they were overdone, next time they were overloaded with the sauce, third time they were near perfect.  Same type of deal has happened with entrees ordered where one time my meatloaf was dry and the next time was slightly undercooked.   My only negative is the consistency of the food sent out. Other than that, this location of Cheesecake Factory is a great one.",

Don't understand why we had to give our name and wait to be called before being seated as we were one of the first customers they had and the place was still empty.  It did fill up fast though.  Over all a good experience. Was busy at opening with people waiting to get in. Service seemed a little slow and we had to wait quite some time for our food.  Mostly the only complaint I have.  Though a slice of cheesecake was a bit much at $7.95,  but I guess they have to make their money someway. I would eat here again.",

    "text": "OK so why does it always take a bad experience to bring me to Yelp to post a review!  I love adding food pictures (944 of them if you want to know) , but tonight there was no food, so inevitably there are no photos of food.       Why you may ask?         Well, let me explain.  It was around 9:45pm or so when we entered the restaurant, there were no lines or waiting, so we (my wife and I) were promptly seated in what I will refer to as man bun hell.  After being seated between two groups of folks along the bar seating area, we were just getting a taste of the evenings adventure as it took approx 5-6 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered ONE Chicken Marsala to be split, It was not long after that our bread and water arrived, but that was all.  By now it was around 10pm as this was clearly stated by our guest at the table beside us as it was getting late and they were ready to leave.  It was about 5 minutes later that the table to the  right of us received their meals and they had time to finish their food even after ordering 5 deserts to go.  At last look, it was 10:38, we had run out of time, patience and understanding.  Our server appeared to be distracted by a table we will refer to as \"friends\" since he was at that table for at least ten minutes - socializing.  He did bring by an empty plate for us to share our meal should it ever arrive.  We received two refills during this time. At no time was an apology given for the lack of food coming from the kitchen.  The table to the right was cleaned and a new group of four guest were seated.  The hostess stated that they would be taken care of \"she promised\"......I stated that \"they should not believe the lies\", as we were obviously not taken care of.  They brought this to their service attention, but our own server arrived and I made it clear that we were leaving.  He suggested that we speak to a manager, however it was too late.  I stopped by the hostess stand but the manager came by.  During this time, the server was observed laughing and showing no interest toward any guest.  Upon leaving the restaurant I called and was promptly placed on hold for seven minutes.  I understand busy nights, but this was just not the case.  I will be following up on this review........",

We arrived shortly after 6 and were seated in the front area of the restaurant, through the bar. The lighting was ridiculous..SO dark. I couldn't even see the booth or menu and saw other tables using their cell phone light to look at the menu. When did the lighting change? Our waitress was such a disappointment, first forgot the lemon for the water, forgot bread, after two requests, and then brought out of one wrong meal. The wine selection isn't that great and the wine we both ordered was horrible. As for the entrees, again, the crab cakes were blah. My friend got the Chicken Romano and was a pile of spaghetti with breaded chicken, which I found very bland. After attempting to order another drink, not another glass of wine, I never received it. Finally asked for the bill, which reflected that second drink.  The worst part about it, $70 for two drinks and two entrees. Isn't this the Cheesecake Factory? Sorry, I have no issue paying $70 when the food and service reflect the price but Cheesecake Factory isn't that place. I will not return.",

He is to commended for his efforts.  Actually all of the staff were friendly. Karmyne, Lauren and Alona were great their smiles and hospitality lit up the place.  They helped us pick the perfect cheesecakes for today's festivities.   We tried the new cinnabon cheesecake.  Simply amazing best dessert you have come up with in years.  Servers were awesome as a team as well. Tiffany, Maria, Adriana and Brett were very helpful as well.  Even Sherard was helping and working.  My table was kept up by the 3 busssers.  Christian, Douglas and his smile that just makes you want to smile and Randy Watson aka Vaughn all helped keep my drink full and table clean.  Mike visited my table and oozes hospitality out of his super sweet mustache.  Sadly this is the experience goes bad.   We had the tomato flat bread.  The basil had black spots on it,  the tomatoes were in consistent in cut size so some were not cooked all the way and were raw in the center.  The flat bread was under done it was mushy and needed to be cut with a knife instead of pulled apart in slices.  The cheeseburger rolls the filling was overcooked and resembled high school sloppy Joe's then a cheeseburger roll. Most people could of made a better filling with hamburger helper. The kids grilled cheese was cooked perfectly.  I think the food could of been better if the kitchen manager actually managed it.  Instead he spent most his time at the front desk.  Also explains the 84 on the health inspection not long ago. I would have complained but the kitchen manager would just have blamed Jamond because he never does anything wrong his kitchen makes everything perfectly.  I tried to speak with a manager but after the initial visit Mike was told to go back to the kitchen.  The other manager just kept walking by looking at our table but never said a word.  At first I thought he wanted to fight me,  then I thought he was looking at me and undressing me with his eyes.  But I realized that he is envious of you know my manhood and his lack there of.",

A manager did address it once the mistake was realized and informed us that they were out of beets. As for the other meals, the food was hot and fresh. Well seasoned and the chicken is never dry. Their meatloaf is double the average serving you would receive in other places.  Most people will have enough for a box to go. Good food, good service.",

Had to request bread to which we got no response but she brought it.  She was very rude when I asked a question about a dish for my son and it worsened when we asked about my nieces nut allergy.  Food finally arrived and it was COLD!!!  Utterly disgusting!!!",

Roland, one of the bartenders, made me one of the best Long Island Ice teas (top shelf) that I've ever had. The woman next to me tried (some sort of) peach drink and she seemed to really like it. I watched them making Mojitos and decided that I'd definitely get one of those on my next visit.     The Asian sesame cauliflower was really good and I fell off the diet wagon with some of the Peanut butter cup cheesecake.

I would suggested requesting for a side of marinara sauce because the sauce that is on the chicken parm wouldn't be sufficient for the pasta. That's just a personal preference. I'm super greedy as well and I just KNEW I was going to have room for cheesecake at the end, but this was a pretty heft portion.   The staff was super attentive and pleasant, especially considering we had a party of 12 and he took care of us on his own.

    "text": "My daughter treated me to lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. I was reluctant to go since I'd been once before many years ago and found it to be too large and overwhelming, and only mediocre as far as the food goes. We went and I had the crusted chicken Romano, which came with pasta. My daughter had a steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. We had to wait quite a while for the complimentary bread. The waiter told us three times that it would be out soon. When it finally came I have to say it tasted perfect. Crusty on the outside, hot and soft on the inside, just the way I like it. My food was pretty good, but I wouldn't order it again because it wasn't anything special that I couldn't make at home. It wasn't hot when it arrived, either. Just warm, and I like my food hot. And the pasta was in a creamy marinara sauce which was too heavy for my taste. My daughter enjoyed her steak dinner. I heard no complaints about it. We were overwhelmed by the many cheesecake choices so we went with the waiter's recommendation, a cinnamon bun concoction. We shared it. It was DELICIOUS!!  It was of ample size to share. I was trying so hard not to keep eating it because the calorie count was incredible. I can only imagine the fat count!! We did manage to take part of it home.  If you visit during lunchtime be prepared to wait. Fortunately, even though we were told it would be 20 to 30 minutes, we only waited about five minutes or so. And I'm so happy we were seated in a part of the restaurant that was more cozy and quiet.  Overall, a pretty good experience. I'm not sure if I'd be able to count on it the next time though. But I might try again another day.",

I called in for a take out order for my wife's lunch. Quick answer, but the wait to place my order was painful... 22 minutes! And when I finally got a response, I let the gentleman know that I had been on hold for 20 minutes. He proceeded to say, \"Nah. I just walked by. It couldn't have been 20 minutes.\" Well, attached is the phone log as a photo.   Now, perhaps I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, but even a small apology would've been more acceptable!!! I know the job is stressful, but common courtesy over complete dismissal isn't too much to ask, in my opinion.  And after I walked in, I waited several more minutes in line to place my take out order. Then, after being told \"no more than 15 minutes\", I waited 25 more minutes for a tuna poke and a cheesecake slice.   I like Cheesecake Factory, and my wife loves it. So I can't say this will be my last time here. I just know going in that I can't expect even decent customer service, and that's very unfortunate.",

This is two weekends in a row.   We came in the 10 o'clock hour on a today on Saturday and ordered the combo and French toast. We were one of three tables on The patio. It took us over an hour to get our food. When we got it the bacon was not hot. My husband asked for salt and pepper, it never came....you know what else never came, a manager to at least apologize for the outrageous wait.   The issue isn't your food. It starts with your managers and then the wait staff that don't really understand customer service.   Our entire experience could have been different if our server would have shown an ounce of care and if the managers would support the servers when the issue is out of the servers hands like long food delivery times.

Parking is convenient as there is a small lot, as well as the deck. There is valet but it looked as through they are only available at dinner time. I just wish they would update their pedestrian crossing section because if you park in the deck, you risk getting hit by the fast cars turning around the corner. There also isn't a sidewalk that wraps around the outside so you have to walk in the street until you reach said sidewalk.   The wine I ordered with my lunch was at a good temperature for a sparkling white, which was extremely refreshing. The wine and cocktail prices were on par with competitors in the area. They didn't have any specials, if that's what you're looking for.  The food was honestly better than I expected. I went for the lunch special and ordered the herb crusted salmon. It was properly cooked with no complaints. It wasn't wowing but it wasn't terrible either.   Because of my diet, or \"lifestyle change\", I declined the cheesecake.  I view The Cheesecake Factory as being on par with Olive Garden... appears to be fancy, but really isn't. I could've made the same meal at home, but I had a gift card to burn so it is what it is.",

The wait is normally long no matter when you go, but on this day, I didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes.   The waitress brought us some bread, but it was cold and not a full order. We looked to the table next to us with the same amount of people and they had twice as much as us. We love the bread here and always look forward to it. Even after we finished our bread, we were never asked once if we wanted some more.   Before we got there, I had it in my head what I wanted, since the menu rarely changes. I have almost all 1,334 pages memorized. Undoubtably, I wanted some of the fried Mac n Cheese balls. Also, knowing that the portions can sometimes be rather large, I decided I wanted the chicken tenders. They say they are Cajun, but as someone who grew up eating Cajun cuisine, nothing about the feels Cajun. I just wanted them because I knew they would bring me a mountain of them.   Once the food came, I was ready to climb the plate. The chicken tenders came with succotash and an order of mashed potatoes. Everything was just as good as it's been in the past. Also, when I say they bring you a mountain of food, be prepared to have plenty left over for the next day (or so).   My wife and I split the lemon raspberry cheesecake (had no clue they even had this) and it was amazing. It's now my favorite cheesecake flavor. I can't wait to have it again  My only real complaint was the service. As I stated, I always expect a certain level of service when I go to Cheesecake Factory and during this visit, I'd rank it at the bottom. I had to flag our waitress down on multiple occasions. I never felt like she cared about us and she never once checked in to see how we were doing. Other than that, my experience was still a good one.",

    "text": "Cheesecake Factory has been my family's favorite restaurant since I can remember but this location is absolute garbage. My husband and I moved to Charlotte in October and have been here 5 times. Every single time we have received terrible service; the food is never made right and even ordering to-go takes well over an hour even if you order one salad. The servers are rude and aren't knowledgeable about their menu at all. I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken and Alfredo pasta on the side. Instead of their usual thick delicious creamy Alfredo, it was literally flavorless liquid that appeared to be a mixture of milk and dried Parmesan. And the chicken that should've been crispy was completely soggy because it was sitting in that watery \"sauce\". I've ordered this dish, I kid you not, 30 or more times and it's never looked anything like this. Terrible location.",

(Food only of course) Me & one other who arrived decided to order some HH apps since we were hungry and the menu is only available from 4p- 6p. We got the crab & artichoke dip, chicken potstickers, and the pork belly sliders. I also got the passion fruit margarita for my drink. All is the appetizers are $5.95 and the full size. The dip is amazing & you can see and taste the lump of crabmeat all throughout it. You got 6 good sized potstickers that have a great flavor and 4 sliders that were really good just wish the pork belly was a little bigger on it. The margarita was freaking delicious I could have ordered 5 of them if they weren't $12 a piece. I will certainly be back to indulge in the happy hour again, just wish they had drink specials as well.",

    "text": "What can I say, the restaurant is pretty. As soon as you walk in the door, the aesthetics of the place is wonderful. The way the tables are positioned, all of the vegetation, and not to mention the ceiling is amazing. I don't like the little tables though, there really isn't enough room for 2 people and all the dinnerware, it seems crowded.  The food? Fantastic! I have eaten here many times and I try to get something different every time I go and I have not been disappointed. The crusted chicken romano is a must, so is the stuffed chicken marsala. For some reason, when I've had a dish with marsala sauce, it seems over powering with the wine, but not at Cheesecake Factory. They get it just right to where you can taste the mushrooms and other flavors with your meal. Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for! They use red potatoes instead of russet or yellow potatoes. The texture is a little lumpy, yet smooth all at the same time.   Let's not forget their cheesecake. That's the reason why you came right? There are 2 pages of cheesecake selections in the menu. All of their cheesecake is wonderful, but make sure you have a glass of water or milk handy because most of their cheesecakes are RICH! They range from your traditional cheesecake with strawberries to a carrot cake cheesecake. If you're a peanut butter fan like myself, fear not, they have about 3 different kind of cheesecake with peanut butter. Let's not forget their carrot cake!! The 1st time I had their carrot cake was at Barnes & Nobles and it was like my mom used to make. Dreamy!  As for the wait, be prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on the weekend at least and during the week about 10-15 minutes to get seated. Never have I gone to the restaurant and gotten seated immediately. It's well worth the wait and what better way to wait at the bar? I'm a Long Island kind of girl, but I have had their cranberry and vodka. Their liquor is all top shelf and I always had a well mixed drink, nothing overpowering in 1 liquor.   The wait staff is knowledgeable and very polite. I've had only 1 server that was pretty bad, but that was because we were his last table and we were taking our sweet time. Yes, it's still not an excuse to be rude and try to rush people out, but overall, I haven't had really bad service.  Cons:  Long wait to be seated. Noise, sometimes can't hear what your company is saying to you across the table from you. Little tables.",

    "text": "I wish I could have the team who designs the inside of these restaurants design my house.  Between the 'Factory in Chicago and the one in Charlotte, they're probably some of the prettiest places to eat.    The food?  It's good.  I've never had the issues the other reviewers are calling the \"6 o'clock sweats\".  But the food here does seem to have some quality that leaves me feeling completely saturated.  Maybe it's one of those places that makes your eyes fall out of your head when you see the nutritional facts on their food.   Whatever the case, the menu is pretty diverse.  I've eaten about a dozen times split between the two 'Factory restaurants I've visited and only been disappointed once.    Their cheesecake is pretty unique.  I can down a slice of cheesecake in a sitting pretty easily, but the cake from here takes me at least 3 attempts to finish it.  But that's a good thing.  It packs all the flavor (and calories, I'm sure) of 3 slices of your typical cheesecake into one slice.    The service has always been very good, even when it's packed, (which is often.) Their beer list is usually pretty decent.  They usually have the typical summer wheat, a couple lagers, a dark and one or two \"local\" brews, (for Charlotte, that means Yuengling.  Chicago was Goose Island.)  Nothing extravagant, but their beer selection does a good job of matching the light, stylish mood of the restaurant.  It's pricey, but I don't come here when I'm searching for a good value.  I come when I'm looking for a reliable menu and a lot of atmosphere.    If you've never been, you really do need to try it.  For the cheesecake if nothing else.",

I always leave feeling stuffed, but guilty because of the huge bill and the huge amount of food that was either thrown away or in a to-go box (which usually ends up...thrown away).  I can almost never get to dessert.    One good thing is the appetizer menu - I could make a meal out of most stuff on there and not feel quite as stuffed.  The fried mac and cheese is good, and so are the pot stickers.  Worth going to say that you've been, but save it for when you've been starving yourself.",

Dipped in a sweet and sour sauce with a touch of spice. We had bang bang chicken and shrimp, a Thai-inspired dish on white rice in a light coconut cream with curry and peanut sauce and hints of ginger and lemon grass. Although it seemed that they forgot to put the shrimp. We also had a combination of chicken madeira and dianne steak encrusted with black pepper and roasted mushroom. It was really a delightful experience. Grab a table on the porch if the weather is fine because it can get noisy inside. The brown bread served was soft and chewy and make sure you have it. Will be back to sample other dishes.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory, tried it a few times bc of friends wanting to eat there. And it's all been the same, I am not hard to please whatsoever but I would of rather gone to Dairy Queen to get a meal and dessert. Money doesnt matter to me but quality of a meal does the last experience will be my last one. Went there with a date ordered two appetizers calamari was perfect but the crab bites was horrible. Ordered two alcoholic drinks one of which was a mint mojito never had anyone butchered the drink that much it was awful. After waiting an hour after finishing our appetizers our food still wasn't out yet nor was the server anywhere to be found, it being not busy and also a Monday night we didnt understand why it was taking so long, finally the manager came over and told us that our food was accidentally sent to another table, understandable we was patient and said its ok 10 mins later someone other than the server brought the food over to our table and it was not what we ordered. Not touching the food we waited a while til the server came to check on us told her the issue she took the plates away and returned with our order, I'm guessing my food was sitting under the warmer in the kitchen for a while bc my steak Dianne was over cooked and dry when I ordered it rare, and the salmon was fishy and cold. The only thing that was truly acceptable was the cheese cake I guess if they messed that up they shouldn't be called the cheese cake factory! I will not be returning anytime soon and I won't be recomending it to anyone considering it was 120 bucks for two people and the food was awful like the service!",

Before it was served in a lovely deep bowl with delicious chicken, carrots, peas and yummy white sauce between the best biscuits ever.  What did they change it to?  The meal is put on an oblong plate, the chicken and other ingredients are swimming in the gravy which isn't appealing and the kicker, no more biscuits; They now serve muffins.  CHANGE THE MENU PEOPLE TO SAY  Chicken and Muffins.  Our very nice waiter informed us some genius in \"Corporate\", figures, made the change and they have had complaints.  Well here is mine.

    "text": "Last weekend while running some errands in Charlotte, my husband, daughter and myself decided that it was time to hit up The Cheesecake Factory. Any other time we have gone, the food is always okay but pricey and we always get two pieces of cheesecake to share. This time around, my husband ordered the meatloaf lunch and when he got it, the meatloaf was dry and he compared it to chow hall food in the military. He said chow hall food was better than that! When the waiter came back like 15 minutes later, I told him that the food as gross. He took it away and never said a word. The manager popped up about 10 minutes later and offered him a menu but told him that everyone's tastes are different and they have never had a complaint about the meatloaf before. My thoughts were, \"it's dry and tough....Who would eat that?\" My husband just ordered a soup and salad lunch combo after he got another menu which was priced at like $15. The salad was horrible and the soup tasted like vegetable water almost. When our waiter came to the table, of course I had to be the one to call out the issues because my husband won't and I didn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't eat. Of course they did nothing about it. They just brought out the cheesecake and made us pay for a meal he did not eat or enjoy. Since I'm heading to Charlotte for my 24th birthday next weekend, I will definitely remember not to go back there and they won't get our business again. We will just mosey on over to Maggiano's for our next big business meeting.",

The serve spoke to the manager and they took it off my bill. What made me love this place more besides the delicious food was that the manager (forgot his name) brought out my plate personally and stated it was totally shellfish free. I really appreciate the fact that he took the time to bring my plate out and acknowledge my special needs. We joked around and he was very nice and accommodating. He was awesome!  Now on to the food. I love coffee so I know good coffee when I taste it and their caramel macchiato was amazing. The fish tacos were really good and omg the Mac n chz are a must Have! I chose a simple fresh strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  Usually when a place says fresh I don't expect it to be really fresh. But the strawberries taste so fresh and sweet and it all went perfect with the cheesecake. I will definitely be going back very soon!",

    "text": "Love love love this place!! They do not take reservations, or call ahead, so don't get mad! Just be prepared and arrive at an earlier time if you don't want to wait long. You can call in, and ask what the current wait time is before you decide to come in. We came last night and it has been awhile. We only had to wait for 40 minutes. I was soooo surprised and so happy lol! The ambience is sooo relaxing! They serve you bread and butter when they bring your drinks. You will easily spend $100 + , so just be prepared, but know that it is TOTALLY worth it! Okay so what do you order? First let's start with drinks. You can't go wrong with the Georgia Peach. It's a frozen alcoholic beverage and will make you think you are on a cruise ship in the middle of the Caribbean! If you don't like to taste your alcohol, this is the drink for you! Another good drink is the J.W's Pink Lemonade! This funky drink will get you ready for your delicious dinner! Okay now on to appetizers. The Tex Mex Eggrolls are the best!! Spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and cheese! Don't forget the Avocado Cream on the side. (I need this recipe!!!) lol. They are so good and you should try them! As far as entrees go, I always get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta! It's spicy! It has shrimp and chicken, with onions and peppers and you are going to need plenty of water or several Georgia Peach drinks to calm your mouth lol!! Buttt it is soooo worth getting it! If you like spicy, this is the dish for you! Now on to the desserts! Ummm cheesecake hello?!?! Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple is really good & I love the Reese's as well. If you aren't a cheesecake fan, get Linda's Fudge Cake. You won't regret it. This place is worth the 5 million calories you will intake. Sometimes the service is a bit hectic, but it's only because the servers have so many tables & they are busy. Just be patient, sip on your alcoholic beverages and relax! I promise it's worth it!",

But I ordered a NY Strip steak and it was not as good as I expected it to be I rate it on the low end of good. The interaction of the family was great and most cleaned their plates. The desert cheesecake was outstanding. The service was very good Angel B did an outstanding job serving and her personality was bright and cheerful.",

When we finally sat down we waited a little and they asked for our drinks.Waiting for the food also took FOREVER we waited about an hour and ten mins.

While ordering he informed us that he doesn't typically work brunch shifts so HE will be back to ask US questions. Which was kind of odd. I ordered the French toast (amazing!) my boyfriend ordered the breakfast sampler. His pancakes were not cooked all the way. He didn't check on us at all before the food came or after & we had to flag him down about the pancakes. He never apologized about the pancakes but just immediately said he would get his manager, the manager that we didn't ask for. He could've easily just offered more pancakes but he didn't. The manager was nice about it but did not listen when my boyfriend said twice that he wanted them to go. When the waiter came back he pushed my cup towards me, the empty cup that did not get a refill and ASKED ME \"get that plate for me\". Bryan B horrible service. Never checked on us. Horrible experience. Another customer had to flag him down for bread.",

I hate to say this is no longer my favorite place. Cleanliness has become a issue. Barely wiped tables/ seats and crumbs on the floor are too obvious for me to ignore. The food has become very inconsistent and can sometimes be sent back a couple of times before satisfactory or just giving up on the dish completely.  It can be super busy so reservations would be nice but that isn't a big deal if you don't mind waiting.  Overall its just decent at best now with exceptional cheesecake and good service.",

Kids and adults enjoy the atmosphere and loud children cannot be heard more than two tables away because the Cheesecake Factory hums.  Your menu is a spiral-bound book.  Take your time and get lost in the offerings.    Beware the \"skinny\" options.  Yes, they are low calorie and low fat, but to me they are so lacking in flavor and substance that one would have to be on a very strict diet to be subjected to the skinny life.    Otherwise, far from the skinny life are many wonderful salads, sandwiches and entrees.  Iced tea is endless and refills are prompt.  The bread is crusty and warm.  I especially liked their soups with the bread.  You will be full when you depart as the portions are generous.  Enjoy.",

My son in law had a burger and my husband had fish tacos. The dishes all came at the same time. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The portions are large and can often leave you with take home. I don't know if another restaurant that allows us to order such a wide variety and have every dish be so pleasing. The food is well seasoned.  I'm not a big fan of the cheesecake, not that it is not good it is just not what I like.  My daughter and husband are fans and ordered it to go.  They have a full bar.

Hot (temperature wise), crispy and has the best sauce you'll ever find.  She loved it.  For entrees she ordered the lunch size Alfredo.  I ordered an Herbed Crusted Salmon with asparagus and sauce.  She really liked her Alfredo...took half home since she couldn't finish it all.  My salmon was good and it had a nice sauce of some type (either a lemon/cream or beurre blanc type).   The asparagus was good, but a bit too al dente for me.  Great restaurant.  One problem is they have such a huge selection on the menu it makes it hard to choose what you want.  The other is the price.  Quite expensive.  I noticed that their hamburgers were $12-$15.  Don't go here often and I probably won't due to the prices.   Great place and food, but the prices and other optional choices in the area put this lower on my list.    I'm only giving it 3 stars.  Food deserves 4-5 stars, but overall the pricing and other issues bring it down a bit.",

    "text": "I usually enjoy Cheesecake Factory. You would think by now they would know how to handle a Friday night.   First and foremost; your doors are broken. They slammed shut 1000 times in the lengthy time I was standing waiting on a slice of cheesecake to go. Someone is going to get injured.  The bathroom looked like Armageddon. Not a paper towel to be found, the box pried open, the sanitary napkin dispenser ripped open.  We waited forty minutes for our to go. The guy in front of us ordered his online and waited longer than us! The poor girl at the Togo register had to check people out, bag the cheesecake, and call the names. Occasionally someone would step over and say \"you got this.\" and move back. Completely ridiculous and inefficient system. I walked to cancel my order but it would have been next to impossible.  We were looking forward to lunch there today but have definitely changed course.",

    "text": "While most people might say you shouldn't leave the Cheesecake Factory without trying their delicious cheesecakes, I say you shouldn't leave without trying their Avocado Rolls (and their cheesecakes of course).   We ordered the Avocado Rolls ($11.95) for an appetizer and they came out warm and fresh. They TASTED AMAZING. I would add their avocado rolls to my favorite dishes of all time. They are filled with soft avocados, peppers, tomatoes(?), and some amazing magic because I honestly can't quite pinpoint why the flavor is so delicious! It also comes with a side of sweet green sauce that tastes really good with the rolls in moderation (I prefer less of the sauce since it is very sweet but it's entirely up to personal preference). The texture of the egg roll balanced with the filling inside is also perfect. It really was the highlight of the meal along with the cheesecake.   We also decided to try some of their sandwiches and they were both decent. I had the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich ($14.95) and my dinner date had the Cuban Sandwich ($13.95). Not anything that I'd order again (since their pasta and other dishes are better in my opinion). It wasn't a bad sandwich, but it definitely doesn't compare to their other dishes on the menu that I've had before. The bread on both the Chicken Parmesan and Cuban Sandwiches just seemed a bit dry and it was not the most exciting thing I've had.   Lastly, their Red Velvet Cheesecake was amazing! Honestly I was glad we ordered a lighter entree to save our stomachs for the star of the show. It's the perfect texture and sweetness and honestly no one would expect less of a cheesecake from the CHEESECAKE factory.   I've eaten at this location several times over several years and their staff is always very friendly and their quality of food is always up to par. Definitely coming back and so glad we got those avocado rolls.",

    "text": "I know, I know... such a high rating for a behemoth hit-and-miss chain like The Cheesecake Factory may seem absurd, but for our second consecutive meal at this Southpark location, it checked all the boxes (that is, after we got past their always uninterested and unmotivated hostesses.) Of course, at this place two things are certain - you WILL wait and you WILL have a difficult time not ordering dessert. We only had to wait 25 minutes, and for us, cheesecake is always a given.  I'll begin with our delightful young server Leanne, who was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. One could easily spend an hour perusing their novelesque menu, however, I knew exactly where to go, which was their Fresh Country Salad starring beets, goat cheese and tender grilled chicken for $15.50. Along with their hot and delicious pumpernickel bread, it was easily substantial enough for a meal. The salad also included a mountain of fresh mixed greens, candied pecans, and grilled asparagus. I ordered the vinaigrette on the side. My mouth waters even now just thinking about it.   My wife went with their Tuscan Chicken at $17.95 off of their Skinnylicious Menu and claimed it was one of the most savory dishes she has ever had. After having a bite, I agreed. At only 580 calories, it consisted of perfectly grilled tender chicken breasts, cherry tomatoes, artichokes, capers, fresh basil and balsamic vinaigrette all served over fresh veggies and farro. What a wonderful mix of flavors!  Finally, yes we ordered a huge slice of their sinfully fabulous Oreo Cheese Cake for $8. I won't even attempt to describe how good it was but I will say that it was a whopping 1680 calories. (Ask me if I care.) We also split, which we both agreed, was maybe one of the best lattes in Charlotte for a reasonable $4.50.   Overall, we had a another great visit. This place seems well managed and is consistently clean. It had a 94.5 sanitary rating. If you can just make it past the snotty little hostesses, I think you'll have a wonderful time in their festive and cavernous dining room (especially if your server is Leanne.)",

Ate their mac n cheese balls for the 1st time and they were divine...frfr. I really need to learn and make these in my own. Our waiter (Marc) was awesome. Super comfortable to talk to and knew how to recommend menu items and just really be the type of server we needed. He always came to the table with a smile and it was genuine. I was highly surprised and happy that the chairs with arms were able to fit my derriere and it was comfy.   Ok, the negative. The bathroom was not clean. It was smelly (at times this can't be helped sit to people) and really needed some TLC. The prices of cheesecake I selected to go (Mango KeyLime) was not as good as the slice I had at the Factory in Chicago. I highly doubt the recipe changed but it was just not to my liking. I really disliked the super sweet coconut layer which sits between the cheesecake and the crust. I don't recall this layer in Chicago but I could totally be mistaken. Just my opinion today.   After this experience and service, I will return again. I said I wouldn't do it after going to the one in the Raleigh NC area but glad my friend suggested we come to this one.",

    "text": "I always have mixed feelings about this restaurant.   I do like their Cheesecakes...but even more, I'm addicted to their \"Louisiana Pasta\". But that's where the love affair ends.  The line for this restaurant is just exhausting...almost disgusting!! It's way too popular for its own good. Just don't understand why they don't open a second branch in town. Just as when this place opened, their wait line is simply out of control...even on a lazy Sunday!  I signed in at 1:05 pm, the front desk girl said it'd be a 30 minute wait...but it turned out to be at least a 50 minute wait. WTF?!? Honestly, I can't believe I waited that long. Oh Wait...I was there to use my Gift Card!  My order (mentioned above!) was delicious, and the waitress was fine on the most part (she was a bit slow with the Ice Tea refill)...and as usual, it was a satisfying dining experience.    But was the wait worth it??? If I didn't have that free Gift Card to spend, I think I would have skipped it. Honestly, after going thru the hideous waiting process for a late Sunday lunch (nearly 1 hour wait?!?), not sure if I'm eager to return anytime soon.  Back to mixed feelings. Despite being a multi-chain restaurant, I've always liked this restaurant...very diverse, eclectic menu! Based on their ambitious menu, especially for their varieties of cheesecakes and the highly addictive \"Louisiana Pasta\" (not sure about the other entrees... since I mostly stick with my faves), I'd easily give it a 4. Same with waitstaff service. But again, there's the long wait, never-ending line...beyond bad! So bad that I'd easily give it a 0. Given how much I love that Pasta dish, guess I'll rate this a 3. If their ridiculous wait issue isn't resolved, I can't see how anyone would think they deserve ratings higher than a 3.",

My two friends and I were served by Tavares who was a pleasure! He was a very thoughtful and attentive server!  My friends got the chicken piccata and the white chicken chili. The chili reminded me of a chicken tortilla soup with its spice and it will definitely be a contender next time I'm there!",

I truly wish there was another Cheesecake Factory in the area because no matter what time you come, you're looking at a minimum of an hour wait. We came to dinner at 5pm and it was an hour and a half wait and they couldn't even give us a buzzer because they had run out. We ended up eating at the food court instead and then waiting in line at the bakery for some to-go cheesecake. We waited 30 minutes to order our cheesecake and 30 minutes to actually receive said cheesecake. They have a horrible system with people everywhere. And disappointingly, the to-go cheesecakes are about half the size of you order in-restaurant (yeah that's right, I noticed).   When we've actually sat down to eat here, waiters are impossible to find and cleanliness is hit or miss. The food has always been great, but seeing as it's a popular chain, I don't really want to rate it based on food quality. The bathrooms are always clean and the atmosphere is nice. Like I said, I truly wish there was another Cheesecake Factory because this one doesn't take the cake (pun intended).",

The mashed potatoes that were supposed to be wasabi flavored, were just their regular mashed potatoes and my \"well done\" steak was very very dry. It didn't even come with the additional food as described in the entrees components of the dish. I didn't get any fried asparagus with it and the overall taste was JUST okay. The only thing that was really good was my Island Ginger Cooler drink. That was great.  that's why I'm rating it 2 stars instead of just 1. Everything was a no for me.",

Pros :  Our server was polite  the wait time was not long at all   Cons :  The food quality has diminished tremendously.  We were served visibly burnt chicken wing appetizers, soggy cod fish with the fish and chips and the guacamole tasted like spoonfuls of salt. I'm vegetarian so my impossible burger and avocado egg rolls were fine, however my family's food was not. When confronting the manager about the wings in particularly, we were told that the food is checked by a food quality manager before it is sent out. I'm assuming the food quality manager is either blind or was off from work because there is no way anyone passed those chicken wings as acceptable. As a yearly family tradition, I think this may be our last visit. We have tried to work with this location but the last 2-3 times the food quality has just been piss poor.",

I know this can't be controlled but just letting people know this place is busy!   Avoid ordering delivery for here though...three times this location completely fumbled the order and left out a few dishes, which were refunded luckily. Unsure if that's a Doordash issue though?",

The first time no one picked up after being transferred, the second call back the bakery associate did pick up the transferred line and said they would check my order and place me on a brief hold.  Her idea of brief is over 10 minutes and I hung up.  I tried a final time and was quickly transferred  again even after explaining how I have been on hold twice.

I had the Factory Chop Salad and it was fantastic and light.  My hubby had Renee's Special, cup of soup, half sandwich, and a gorgeous salad.  He ran 10 miles so he finished the WHOLE thing.

Guys and couples ALWAYS get served first...even when they arrive after us! Their orders taken promptly, bread, drinks come right away ..and food is served usually in 15 min.  We are good tippers...and quick to order since we have an hour.   However when it now takes 35-45 minutes to get food, even when bar area is not busy, we don't have time to eat.....Too expensive to have to inhale the food and not enjoy a bite.  This never happens when a male coworker joins us....go figure!!  4 Stars for food/1 Star for Service",

Finished it off with Red Velvet Cheesecake....big enough to share, and OMG delicious! My only \"gripe\" is that they serve free bread baskets and we never got one, forcing us to order an appetizer because my blood sugar was crashing and I needed food quickly. Fried zuchinni was to die for, and for only $5 it is a very cheap appetizer. Overall, very good and can't wait to go back! PS, the menu is an actual book, so there is something for everyone!",

You literally sit five inches from the guests beside of you. This may not be a problem for some, but I always make sure to ask for a booth to avoid these tables. This place has a HUGE menu. I don't think you can go wrong with what you choose, though. My favorite dish is the shepherds pie. It's a huge portion and so delicious. I like that, during lunchtime, you can get the half portion. I usually still end up taking some home! If you're not starving, I recommend getting the cuban rolls, which are an appetizer. I enjoy the cuban sandwich, but actually love these even more. They're so crispy and come with a great dipping sauce. Oh, and the cheesecake is a must- duh. Even if you have to take it to-go. I've had so many of their cheesecakes and just can't choose a favorite. You seriously cannot go wrong! Try this place next time you are in the Southpark area!",

So upon arrival, we were told an hour and a half for a table for two.  The menu is huge and they have lots of options.  The food was okay but nothing special - definitely overpriced for quality.  It was no better and no worse than any other chain joint but significantly higher priced than something like a Sagebrush or Applebys and not better quality.  Five-star prices, three-star quality, one-star service is the best way to describe it.  My date ordered the shrimp and mushroom dish which was served with no mushrooms.  I order the ribeye which was slightly overcooked (ordered medium rare - served medium).  The worst part was definitely service.  Our waiter disappeared for extended periods of time and in fact, never checked on the food which was delivered to the table by someone from the kitchen (I assume), so we never had the chance to explain that the dishes were not exactly correct (I was okay with the steak, but my date specifically wanted the mushrooms in the \"shimp and MUSHROOMS\" dish.  We waited over 30 minutes for the check and another 15 for the cheesecake to-go (which I order before the check).  I will say that the cheesecake was delicious later that night.  I would go back for the cheesecake - probably to-go, but I would definitely not wait for a table when the food is only average at best.  The atmosphere was crowded and chaotic so definitely not a great experience.  I only give two stars because the cheesecake was excellent.",

It was like some kind of much.  It was barely warm. The taste was awful.  The chicken salad  sandwich had almonds and way too much mayonnaise.    Besides that buttered bread was on the sandwich.  Nothing in the description said the toast would be buttered.  The salad was saturated with the dressing.  Even the unsweetened tea tasted old. My waiter was Mr. positive but didn't wait on me or ask me if everything  was OK.  He was concerned that my tooth picks that held the sandwich together was taken apart.  I told him that I didn't like butter all over my bread.  He said, \"OK, just wanted to be sure that they didn't leave it that way.\"   I would expect that he should have asked me if I wanted bread without the butter but he didn't and got away so fast that I couldn't ask him.  He never came back to ask me if I needed tea or anything. The soup was so bad I didn't eat it at all.  I ate the salad or there would be no lunch. When he picked  up my plate, he said, I guess this means that you have no room for cheesecake.  I guess he said that because most of the food was still on my plate. Once again he sped off not given me a chance to tell him that the soup was awful.  Very disappointing.",

It was very good. It was a hefty portion for a hefty $30 price tag. Our server was excellent on this trip. He was friendly and on top of refills.

I can't quite put my finger on it; it's pretty good, never bad or not fresh, but it almost ALWAYS has me running home right after to take care of some, er, business. I heard once that they don't change their cooking oil very frequently. Whatever it is, it always gets my stomach, and the same holds True for everyone I go with. We actually coined a name for it, you usually get the \"6 o'clock sweats\" - you go to bed okay but then wake up around 5 or 6 am with your stomach turning.

It was pretty close to lunch time and they had ample seating for the lunch rush.  I recommend highly the avocado rolls for the appetizer!  OMgosh... Delisious-ness abound!!!  For the main meal I had a veggie sammich, which was great, great great!  Loaded with eggplant and mushrooms and other yum yums.   It was plenty of food for the both of us with sandwiches and the app. for around 40 bucks, so it's moderate in the price scale.  I hear their namesakes desserts are good and do look well, but milk, and creams don't bode well with the ole system, if ya catch my drift! One downer of the meal, was that the strip on my debit card is worn and the waiter had to manually type it, but when he came to the table he told me that it was declined, which was embarrassing, but then handed me the merchant copy to sign??!?!  I dunno what that was all about, but poor choice of words, waiter!",

That being said, there is something to be found for everyone. Also, be prepared for a long wait to be seated. On this trip the wait was just under an hour but at times the wait has been closer to 2 hours. But the wait is always worth it.   My6 husband and I tried the buffalo blasts for an appetizer and OMG! Amazing.  They are crispy fried wontons filled with shredded chicken, cheese, and buffalo sauce served with a side of buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. One word:YUM! A must have anytime you're at the factory. The drinks from the bar were great.  I had the Georgia Peach and my husband had an LIT. Both were good sizes and very generous with the alcohol.  For the main course I had the New Orleans Chicken Pasta and it was amazingly delicious. The plate was ginormous so I had way more than half leftover. My husband had the Steak Diane and it was to die for. Perfectly seasoned, juicy,  and cooked to perfection. For dessert i had my normal, Carrot Cake Cheesecake which was not as good as normal (a bit too heavy tonight) but the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake that my husband had was amazing. it tastes just like vanilla bean ice cream.   Our server Will, was awesome and all the wait staff seemed very personable.   I love The Factory and recommend it often. This one did not disappoint.",

The extensive menu has been perfected over the past twenty years (good gawd, I am getting OLD!) and the drinks are usually strong and comparably priced.  As much as I loooove good cheesecake (really, I'd eat it off the floor a'la Friends) I rarely get any b/c I'm so stuffed from my Chinese Chicken Salad (or Caesar), the addicting bread & butter and sampling whatever delish dish my hubby ordered. Maple glazed pork tenderloin is excellent (and I do not eat pork.) Spicy Cashew Chicken has been a favorite of mine for years. However, when I do get dessert I will likely order the ADAM's PB CUP FUDGE RIPPLE. Oh sweet jesus..if I were still single, this cheesecake could easily make up for the lack of a man!  Cheesecake Factory is great for dates, brunch (HUGE omelets), girl's night out and business meetings. The only reason I did not give this location five stars is b/c (in my opinion) it's hard for any chain to achieve that status but most important, they did not go above/beyond w/a very special request to just this once take a reservation from an out of country visitor. The woman flew all the way from Trinidad, here's her passport and ticket, just got off the plane and the first thing she wants is to eat there; can we NOT make her wait two hours??? I spoke w/the manager a few days ahead of time and he wouldn't make any effort to help. As a long term customer I was very disappointed in his lack of customer service and that has stayed w/me...I haven't been back since. :(",

Quite interesting to see a big change in the service and quantity of food.  I remember the service was poor and the food quantity  was very less for the price at all other locations. May be it's just this location. I went in a group of seven and ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees. Entrees came in big portions. Especially the jambalaya dish was huge. I loved the bourbon street omelette.  Chicken marsala, calamari, chicken dumplings are always my favorite here. I highly recommend angel hair pasta for all the pasta dishes.  Bottom line: I  would love to come to this location again if I'm in the Charlotte area.",

    "text": "Arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night with a party of 9. Was told it would be an hour wait. The timing was totally off b/c they sat us in 15mins. We should've known then that it was too good to be True. My husband ordered a beverage, but never received it throughout the course of our meal. We ordered our dinner around 10:30pm and it took about 45mins to receive our food. We were told by the waiter that it takes a long time to cook a steak well. Really? First of all, you don't tell your customers an excuse like that. It doesn't take that long to cook a steak well either. Then when the food came out, my entree was cold. So that tells me that most of our food was already done but not brought out. Once we receive our food, we saw the waiter one time, then never again. We waited at least 15mins after we finished eating just to get the check. At this point my party is very irritated and just want to leave. We finally asked 2 other servers for a manager. One server stated that the managers were very busy. I told him that they shouldn't be too busy if a customer is requesting to see them. The manager comes out and asked if everything was ok? We all said no, not at all. As he walks over to me, i hear him mumble under his breath, \"everything hasn't been ok for me tonight either.\" Or something to that effect. When I asked him what did he say for clarification, he changed his words and said \"what's wrong?\" Like he really cared. Well after explaining to him about all of our problems and he could see that our table was full of dishes, meaning no one had been by to clear the table, offer dessert or coffee. He apologizes for everything, comps my meal but didn't offer anything else for the rest of my family that traveled out of town and are here for the first time. This was a very bad experience at cheesecake all together, including how the manager handled the situation. Highly disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory.",

Waiter was very friendly but seemed pretty stretched out due to the hectic atmosphere.  Got drinks promptly. However we waited 40-45 minutes for our food. We decided to check in with our waiter, said that the steak wasn't well done yet and that he wanted to make sure the food came out altogether.  Just wanted some food out at that point and told the waiter to bring out the other three dishes. The nachos and guac were great; best thing eaten at the meal. The spring rolls were dried out. The club sandwich bread was burnt.  We understood that the waiter wanted to be nice and make sure everything came out at the same time but the quality of the other food was bad due to that. Also understood that the place seemed to be understaffed during holiday season but this particular meal wasn't able to be fully enjoyed.   Suggestions to future patrons: Ask the waiter or waitress how long the food should take Specify if you would like the food to come out ASAP or altogether Ask if substitutions or removals are acceptable for your food before you have your heart set on it Bring a charged electronic device or engaging conversation Expect a wait and a jostling/busy atmosphere",

The food is occasionally very good, but most often it is merely serviceable--you'll eat it, you won't be hungry afterwards, but two days later you won't be able to recall what it was you ate. I suspect that has something to do with the extensive \"something for everybody\" menu, which makes me think no single kitchen could prepare all of these dishes with equal skill. Thus, some items might be sort of roughed out in the kitchen by the cooks, while others are done with flourish and panache.  It is a ridiculous amount of food presented on the plate, and I would be a more frequent guest there if the food cost 2/3 as much and the portion was proportionately reduced. I likewise won't bother with a 20-40 minute wait--I'll eat in the food court, save myself about $30 for the wife and me (especially with no wine), and stop by on the way out for some cheesecake slices to go.  Finally, I prefer eating outside when the weather permits. It isn't a great view (the parking lot) but the noise level is much lower than inside. Modern restaurant designers seem to have a fetish for hard surfaces within the dining area, reflecting kitchen noise and patron conversation into an enormous dull din. Supposedly, this creates a sense of energy in the place; for me, it is more like eating in a construction site. If inside is all that is available, I'm heading back to that food court...",

We got seated to wait 10 mins before a sever saw us. Her name was Blair, I believe. She seemed rather annoyed that we had two kids with us, and preoccupied with other things. We waiting 10 mins to just get our drinks. I am a completely understanding person, especially when a server is seated too many tables at once, but she was talking with other servers, joking around, our son had asked her for some extra dressing and she clearly forgot ( but realized when we had pre-bused our table.) Not only did our drinks were not refilled, she did not once check on us to see how our food was until we we're wanting to order dessert. It took an additional 15 mins to get dessert, which we kinda regretted ordering to have to wait that long. Not only did I leave 20% gratuity, because I am in the tipping business and I do unto others. But I never normally complain on service, and I felt like I was a bothersome to her, I have never had issues at any Cheesecake Factory other than today. But I don't think this woman liked kids or liked us because we are \"young parents\" with tattoos that we would even tip. She probably shouldn't be in this business of customer service. Just BEWARE OF BLAIR!",

It also took an hour just to get our food - which is crazy.  The server said \"there is a problem in the kitchen\" which was not helpful or reassuring.  Didn't get cheesecake because we were afraid it would take another hour.  Not sure we will be back.",

First he forgot to ring in my order, He did apologize for the mistake and gave me 2 free rounds of drinks to make up for it. But he kept repeating himself and breaking stuff.

My wife had the Lettuce Wrap, I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and our guest had the Pasta Di Vinci. We will each have these again one day soon...unless we decide to try something new again.

We arrived very hungry and with not terribly high expectations but were still disappointed. Not a big deal. It's only one meal but in the future will get desserts here and meal elsewhere.

    "text": "So I think make my \"Monday Night\" an easy work week night and get take out from Cheesecake Factory. Boy was that a wrong call especially since this is their slowest night! So I complete and pay for my order by 8:01 and was quoted 20 to 25 mins and waited until 8:42 at which point I asked the same take out cashier who had rang me up what was going on she replies waiting on fries and I said well you told me 20 to 25 she replies back I said 25 to 30 I said no but let's go with that then what's taking an extra 15 by the time that banter is done she had no answer except would you like me to get a manager and I replied yes that and the food you said would be ready within the 30 minutes that's now 45 so I wait for him ( Adrian) I believe was his name and after watching him deal with another customer to whole he gave a free slice of cheesecake because I'm guessing resolving yet another dissatisfied customer I unleash a flurry of choice words on their lack of customer service and kitchen performance because 2 hamburgers and a couple of salads do not take 1 hr worth of prepping because the prep boy that came in at 6am already chopped everything up and it's a matter of putting it all in a box. Meanwhile I have a viewership because I have become irate over the lack of concern as the store manager I believe Brandon to be was just watching with a blank stare and I ask him what's he doing and he states just listening to you didn't want to interrupt so I said you'll have to cause I'm long winded. Had nothing to offer so I had him go chase for his business card so I can call corporate or at least email them with first hand insight to their Monday night standards and hope they can improve on it. See the things that makes me so mad, irate or just blow my lid is unlike most people that complain I wasn't looking for \"free\" anything as I always reject such option. That's a band aid on an open wound. What I want is for you to take the time and go look into the issue and fix it and not give me this blank stare like you are surprised to see a customer so upset over a couple of burgers taking an hr to be made. Are you freaking kidding me! I've seen junior chefs make complete meals in an hr and yours can sling out some burgers in 30 mins. Time for training session or new cooks. They're a dime a dozen I'm guessing since it's not a restaurant where you have the liberty to make your menu as you go. Hope this helps you Brandon with what the issue was and you jump on it and get it taken care of. I know it's not the first time service has been lack luster and that's putting it mildly! And to all the staff just being a spectator on the conversation it makes sense why your operation was lacking and why the customer before me got a free dessert from you!",

I hate waiters to rush me before I even have a chace to look at the menu. I ordered a Cesar Salad  wirh Chicken when I started eating I found a long black hair tangled the the lettuce. So gross. Then my daughter's meatball and spaghetti pasta came. OMG! Horrible no taste completely cold and the plate all dirty with this disgusting tomato sauce. Sent it back asked for them to write off from check and the only thing they took out was the salad. The supposed Manager came to the table, a very sloppy looking blonde older woman, never gave eye contact or an apology, just told me she would get me another salad. Another salad? Forget it!  One hair was enough. Our family will never be back to eat here again. A $90.00 check was a complete slap on the face. Very disapointed .",

    "text": "When you are in need of a slice of sweet sugary deliciousness, The Cheesecake Factory has got you covered. It's a staple \"nice restaurant\" sure to please even the pickiest of eaters...their menu is like a novel, granted half of it is full of advertisements.   You can quickly turn to the lunch menu, page 8. The portions are plenty and will run you around $10, give or take. However, their regular beverages will run you a solid $4. A nice perk is that they serve their \"chocolate and vanilla\" bread (that's only how my friend's daughter describes it, not the flavor) anytime of day, whether you eat lunch or dinner. They do not have very many vegetarian options, but they do have a veggie burger filled with brown rice and beets.   This location is prime...after a fun shopping spree at South Park, you can relish the day on their open patio! Service was attentive and friendly and the people working the host desk were all smiles.   I don't go here often, but it's one of my mom's favorites and when nothing but cheesecake will suffice it is my go to place (a slice will cost you approximately $10). Like me and everyone else the day I was here, you'll leave full and happy with a \"to go\" bag in hand with a slice of deliciousness for later.",

Everything came out promptly and they kept our tables clean and drinks full. Food was great which I have come to expect from Cheesecake Factory. Everyone enjoyed their food and of course most of us took cheesecake to go. Our one server (Mike?) was a riot, he felt like one of the gang and I'm sure we drove him a little nuts with how big our group was, but he was awesome! Thanks for another great dining experience Cheesecake Factory!",

    "text": "Generally speaking I'm not a chain restaurant fan. This place is decent though. We came tonight for my moms birthday and I get the appeal for her. She's a midwestern bland food kind of person. Nothing wrong with that, but I am the exact opposite so I only find it \"ehhh\". The menu is insanely large and overwhelming. Seriously, I've never seen a restaurant have so many options and I'm not sure that's a good thing either. The prices are also very high, however one entree is enough food for two people so it evens out... Seriously the portions are ENORMOUS. I finally decided on the Parmesan crusted chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken tasted good but the Parmesan crust was soggy. The green beans were bland and underdone but the mashed were very good. It did take forever to get our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you're in a hurry. I love their pineapple upside down cheesecake however it's seasonal and not available... I haven't had it in years so it may not even be a thing anymore. I opted for the original; not bad but obviously comes in frozen and then thawed for sale. My mom got the key lime cheesecake and I wasn't a fan. I prefer New York style cheesecake and this was really thin. However if you prefer the thinner version you will love it and huge bonus point the whipped cream is homemade and not from a can!! Overall it's an a-okay place for a meal. It absolutely knows it's audience and appeals to them successfully. I get the success, just not a place I will be a regular at.",

The waiter, Blue had said they overcooked my son's cheeses teak (without onions or mushrooms ). No visit by the manager and our food took 30 minutes to arrive anyhow!  Food quality is dropping rapidly too;  I ordered the chicken Maderia.  It came with two asparagus. Three weeks ago there were at least eight. We will not return to this location.  Also, the health inspection score is low at 94.5.  Never again!",

    "text": "This review isn't about the Cheesecake Factory themselves but a props to their happy hour. We all know Cheesecake Factory... big portions. An extensive menu. Stark white shirts that I have no clue how every server keeps them bright white all shift. But have you ever been by for happy hour?! Best in Charlotte. Hands down.   Post up at the bar (HH only at the bar) and grab a menu. About a dozen different options, all from the Cheesecake Factory's regular appetizer menu all for $5 each. Chris and I decided to get the tex mex eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They delivered the dishes and damnnn... full-sized plates. And if you've ever been to CCF you know how much food that is - and for $5! I couldn't believe it wasn't smaller HH portions!  The buffalo blasts were piled high - 8 to the plate. And is a crispy, fluffy, deep fried pocket. Bite in and it is filed with juicy grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. And as a huge lover of all things spicy, I was in love. I recommend with sour cream. Awesome cooling effect to the buffalo. We ended up eating 3 of the blasts and 4 out of the 6 eggrolls. Packed a to-go box and left highly satisfied.   Only downside, I work in Uptown and the happy hour here goes from 4 to 6pm. To get to South Park after work is always a challenge so if I have my heart set on some buffalo blasts, need to slip out a bit early. And you must sit at the bar. Which consists of 10 seats. Not always the easiest seat in the house to get!",

    "text": "This place is 4.5 stars for me. I've been coming here for many years ever since they opened. This place is ALWAYS crowded during dinner time, if you come around 6-8 you will probably have to wait unless if you made a reservation, this is particularly True on the weekends. I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you've had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls. The cheesecakes are around $6-8 per piece. Very large size served on a large plate, can be shared among 2-3 people. Drinks are around $7-12, pretty good as well, great mixed drinks.",

    "text": "Me and my family visited The Cheesecake Factory for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  First off, we are not from Charlotte and we do not have a Cheesecake factory near our house.  We are Big Bang Theory super fans so when we saw it we knew we had to try it.   If you are like us and have never been or saw one other than on the show, then you will be in for a big surprise too!    Atmosphere:  We arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night.  The wait was minimal even though it was pretty busy.  We requested outside seating since it was a perfect night for it, and were escorted right out.  Tables were nice, and had a small candle on it for a nice little touch.  The building the restaurant is located in is very nice as well.  Very upscale looking and a classy place overall.  Much different vibe and style than was in the show.  ( Hang with me through the BBT show comments, I am sure others are wondering the same as we were. )  8/10  Menu and Price Point:  As most others have mentioned the menu is very very extensive.  You would be really hard pressed to not find something that you like.  Very detailed which I like because I am a picky eater, and nicely laid out considering the size of the menu.  As for price, I got the Penne, My wife got the Chicken and Biscuits (think chicken pot pie), and my daughter just wanted cheese sticks.  We also got 1 piece of the Oreo Dream cheesecake and the total bill was 53.00 and some change.  Not too bad considering the portions are huge and the food was very tasty.  7/10  Service:  When we first walked in the greeter was not super friendly like most places of that caliber but, when we were seated things changed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and super helpful.  He was very attentive despite being pretty busy, and took the time to talk to us and offer suggestions.  He even addressed my daughter who is 10, which most of the time wait staff just look at us for her order.  I liked that and i think she did too.  8/10  Food:  The food was very good.  Like i mentioned above my daughter got an appetizer for her main meal which was the Cheesesticks.  She liked them and even made the comment she wished there was more.  On a couple they were overcooked a little but she didnt complain and just peeled off the coating.  My wife had the Chicken and Biscuits and she really enjoyed it and gives it a 8/10.  She could only eat about half a quarter of it due to the sheer amount she was given.  I got the Penne Pasta, and it was cooked perfect for me.  It was a little short on sauce but really was very tasty.  I did add a little salt, and I asked the waiter for some Parmesan cheese and he brought out a block and grated some fresh for me right at the table.  Im a big guy and I couldn't eat it all due to the portion size.  8/10 for me on the pasta.    I will definitely be back for me on my next visit.    P.S.... Haven't tried the cheesecake yet but its a massive slice.",

Crispy exterior and soft flavorful interior. I like it dipped in their homemade ranch better than the sweet dipping sauce the egg rolls come with.   Chili Rellenos were somewhat disappointing. The hot, melty pepper jack cheese inside is awesome, but the pepper has a very green pepper flavor rather than any spiciness. The crunchy fried outside is good but overall this was a miss for me. Not really worth the calories.   The veggie burger was made with beets (along with brown rice, farro and black bean) and was not good at all. It was cold and sweet and bland.   You can't go wrong with any of the desserts. We had the banana cream cheesecake, which is our standby favorite. And I also tried Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, made with layers of brownie, coconut cheesecake, chocolate cake, coconut frosting (similar to the topping for German chocolate cake) and whipped cream. It was good, but I've had better.",

It was yummy tonight, sometimes the noodles are bit more aldente than I prefer, but tonight they were great. The chicken in the dish was lacking, but nonetheless I enjoyed my meal in in it's entirety. Surprisingly I don't even eat cheesecake but the do make some pretty decent food. Tonight we were seated immediately, and our food didn't take too long to come out. our waitress was in training, and she did just fine. Of course they're conveniently locate @ South Park Mall, entrance right where the valet stand is, check them out if you're in the area.",

The food is good, just like and Cheesecake Factory that I have been to...Wait, it's Cheesecake Factory, the food is AWESOME! The only reason that I am giving this 4 stars and not five is that we had an annoying waiter and waitress issue at the beginning of our service. There were 4 people that saw us in the first 10 minutes of being there. We ordered drinks with 3 different people and then almost ordered dinner with two people. Finally when we got our waitress she was awesome!  I got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, awesome as usual! P.S. I need to try something new next time. I got the chocolate cake, 5 stars for that! It even tasted better the next day!",

    "text": "I'd first like to preface my review by saying that I prefer to eat at non-chain restaurants too.   But of the chains, I have a special fondness for the Cheesecake Factory. Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it's lunch time.   I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I can't recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. That's why I think it's always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can't decide on cuisine that night.   The service isn't bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you're a regular you probably won't know who's who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I've had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it.   Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake. It's always terrific.   You know what to expect with the cheesecake factory... huge menu, diverse selection, decent service, great cheesecake.",

It took forever for our server to come take our order. When he brought out our water, there was a lot of debris floating in it. We sent them back and the same thing was in the second round. At this point, we all just opted to get soft drinks. Our appetizers were sub par as well. I love the avocado eggrolls at CF, but these were kinda brown looking and sad. The spinach and artichoke dip had a funny taste, I didn't even eat it. We all ended up ordering salads. When they came out, all the lettuce looked a little wilted. Like I said, it wasn't anything like my usual experiences at CF. Maybe it was just an off day....",

The space is overwhelming with ceilings that go higher than the sky.  The noise level is too much.  This place is good for groups, if you don't mind waiting in lines, loud conversations, and food that is made for the masses.   GO HERE to meet your friends to have fun.  We DID have fun!  I had the fish tacos and they were good.  The guacamole tasted fresh and the taco was actually really delicious.  But, I was still overwhelmed.   Gosh, now that I think about it, the feeling of being overwhelmed started in the parking lot.  Trying to find a place to park here is not impossible, but nearly impossible.  I was so excited all those years ago when The Cheesecake Factory came to Charlotte. It's amazing at how the years can change us and how we perceive foods and places and even our friends. I think our taste buds change too, over time.   If I could still eat cheesecake without the guilt (as I did 15 or 20 years ago), I would probably be writing a five star review.   As it is, I remain overwhelmed, but will agree that this was good enough for four stars.    If my friends said to meet them again here, I'd do it, especially if I had my earplugs and a tranquilizer.",

The South Park mall is also pretty nice. Much larger than expected and some trendy local stores to check out while walking off your CCF meal :-) however, if you do not park nearby and you plan to leave after 9:00pm, best to park by that exit or any mall exit because stores close and you may need to walk the outside of the mall to get to your car from there!",

My family and I went March the 23rd, we got there at 2:30 and were told we had to wait an hour and a half despite there being a good 20% of their tables left. It being my aunts birthday we were going to wait the asked time. When the hour and a half was up we went back to get seated ,and were told that \"there was a problem in the kitchen\" that had set them back half an hour, so we waited another half an hour; went back and checked, another fifteen minutes. At this point we're debating whether or not to stay, but we were told \"you're third in line\" , and waited inside. While waiting in line we were listening in on the manager to see who was being called next and noticed an odd pattern of wait times, upon further listening and observing we noticed that the man was being racist. I can't remember for the life of me what this man looked like other than he was tall and white. People of color would come in and get a three hour wait time then some white people would come in and get an hour, which is absolutely absurd. After waiting a little more we were seated and asked for another manager, we complained about the mans blatant racism and ridiculously long wait times; he said he'll take care of the problem and apologized, he was very nice but only came back at the end of the meal to say that he would do something nice for us; he never did. All of the food was good other than a steak being burnt, and the waitress was the nicest we could've had, despite the manager being awful to everyone in his path. After we finish we pay and leave; once we were home we called corporate to alert them of the wreck that the Charlotte Cheesecake Factory was, and after two weeks we were sent a twenty-five dollar apology check for something we drove a hour and a half for and paid at least 175 for, we were never called back or assured that the manager was taught some basic human decency.",

We had a great waiter, Adam, and he was knowledgeable and friendly. I always get their Tropical Ice tea, it is light and refreshing. We ordered some old favorite appetizers, The Avocado Egg Rolls, Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.  Then the Grilled Artichokes, so delicious and a great aioli! We ordered a great Beet and Goat Cheese salad in a delicious vinegarette! And then for the CHEESECAKE! We had the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecke, heavenly! With a huge flower of Chocolate Ganache on it. I took three pieces home to my family, an Original, A Dulce Caramel, and a Chocolate mousse.  This is not a inexpensive place but so worth every penny. And there is not a better Cheesecake around!  I would say, go  and save room for the Cheesecake but the food is really delicious, so go hungry!",

Well on March 7th 2019 I had the worst experience I could possibly have had. When coming into the location I was the third customer in line at the cheesecake counter. The restaurant was not packed even though that should have nothing to do with the people who are not ordering food. So once I order I stepped to the side to wait. After about 2 to 3 minutes she took my cheesecake out of the display case and sat it one the counter. Then another almost 20 min went by before I was given my order. The elderly couple that was in front of me came back up to counter to inquire about what was taking so long. There are two individuals behind the counter and they are ignoring her. After she tried to get their attention the third time I walked up to counter and asked her what she had. Then I said excuse me to the individuals and asked them what was taking so long with we order (Let me add that the customer that ordered before me but after the elderly couple already got her order a long time ago). The lady behind the counter told me that they have to do the orders for the entire restaurant. I asked her what does that have to do with the people who are not ordering food. She finally gave the elderly couple their order. So I tasked her my order is just sitting there why can't you just give it to me so I can leave. She replied that they go by the tickets. Then she gave me my order. It makes no sense to me. If someone walks up to the counter to order some thing the is already made and sitting there why can't they get it and go. All they have to do is put in on a plate and hand it off. There is no reason why they should have to wait all that long time to receive something that is just sitting right there. The other customers are ordering are sitting in the restaurant enjoying themselves. I'm standing and waiting for something that could be taken care of instantly. If there were so many orders as she made it out to seem them the cashier that rung me up should have turned around and put my order on a plate and bag and gave it to me. I would not have minded waiting 2 minutes for her get the customer order in front of me instead of waiting over 15 minutes and having my order just sitting there staring at me while other people are breathing all over it. If you are presented with the opportunity to appease your customers in any way it should be taken. I came from 4 hrs away and I make sure I come by everytime to get some food from your restaurant. Once I left the restaurant the wife came back into the entry way to talk to me. She too was visiting and was very unhappy with the way she was treated. And she said she was not coming back. Things like this is how you lose customers!",

We each got a sangria. When we got our bills we saw we were charged $11.50 for the sangria. When we told our waiter we wanted the SkinnyLicious sangria he said we never \"said\" that and he in no way tried to take responsibility for getting the wrong drink order. I am just so angry at myself for not asking for the manager or not leaving him a tip. Other than that we had a wonderful time and the food was good except my husband said the jambalaya wasn't as good as he remembered it.",

My group decided to wait and it turned out to be a 3.5hr wait. Our server was very professional and worked very hard but I was disappointed when I asked to substitute chicken for Ahi Tuna. I specifically stated three times \"if the up charge is over $21 then I will take the salad how it comes.\" She responded \"that shouldn't be an issue\". The salad I ordered, the Chinese Chicken Salad, was originally a $16 salad. The seared Ahi Tuna Salad was $19. I paid $24 (not including tax) to substitute Tuna for chicken. If you think about the price, $16 is how much the Chinese Chicken Salad cost (with the chicken included). To add chicken to any other salad, it is about $5 to $6. If you subtract the chicken and add $8-$9 Tuna, the total cost of the my salad should have been $19. I have never had a good experience at the Cheesecake Factory and I only return for a party that I am invited to. I could not recommend the Cheesecake Factory.",

Called several times to check on my order only to be placed on hold for 15 mins then after hanging up and calling back, placed on hold again! Got fed up and walked into the restaurant only to learn that they didn't even place my order. An hour and a half of my life that I can't get back and no Tex Mex rolls. Don't waste your time on this chaotic joke of a restaurant. The food is good but the service consistently sucks! One star is generous...  So I went to the contact page as Suggested... an equally frustrating and convoluted Experience. How about giving me some real contact info if you are interested in hearing more about my experience. Way to add insult to Cheesecake Factory. Another example of their disregard for customer service",

My sister and I came up to Charlotte to shop at the mall and decided that before we left to go back home we would stop by the Cheesecake Factory and get a few slices of cheesecake to go home. My sister had been to this location to get cheesecake before but I hadn't. We didn't think about how crazy the place might get but at around 4pm we decided we were done shopping and headed to the Factory. The line just to buy cheesecake was out the door. We stood in line for around 25 minutes just to place our order for the cheesecake and then was told to step aside into another line where you waited for another 10 to 15 minutes for the staff to pull the cheesecake slices you ordered. When I had finally gotten to the register I asked the lady working if it was always crazy like this....she of course laughed and said absolutely (note for next time). I wish they would come up with a better system to process and take the cheesecake orders and if it is always that busy maybe invest in a few more employees to help out. Regarding the cheesecake itself, I ordered two slices a turtle pecan and tiramisu. I loved the tiramisu but wasn't crazy about the turtle pecan (too much actual cake and not enough cheesecake). Overall i'll definitely be back to grab some more cheesecake but i'll make sure I set aside enough time to order it.",

To which, she responded by shoving the final bag in my face (without checking a ticket or receipt-- meaning she knew it was mine.)   I persisted on getting a refund, and was eventually greeted by a manager RYAN who didn't apologize and defended the woman's actions. He finally gave me my refund, and the cashier in the background muttered \"thank you for the free food.\"   Quite hardly the service I'd expect.

You expect consistency and at least passable quality when going to a chain establishment, but not the case here at this location. Wednesday night last week stopped in for a late dinner (9PM) after a long day. The server was great very attentive, but unfortunately the same couldn't be said about the kitchen. Ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps  and my friend ordered a burger - one hour in an empty restaurant to grill some chicken - and plate it with lettuce. Kind of crazy, no apology from the waiter on the wait.   Food finally came out - there were three chicken pieces on the plate - 3 about the size of two of my fingers side by side. - $14 for that? Sauce was missing from the plate and the lettuce was rotting. I wish I would have stopped to talk to a manager, but after a long day all I wanted was to eat and go home especially after an hour wait in a basically empty restaurant.   I really hope this location gets it together, because this experience has a previously loyal customer questioning future visits.",

I received two tickets to see \"The Space Between Us\" and decided to make the evening a girls night.   We grabbed dinner then had the most amazing cheesecake! We arrived around 5ish and sat near the bar. At first my niece was overwhelmed with the wide selection of cheesecake. She finally settled on the Oreo Cheesecake. I had the original with strawberries on top. Of course it was DELICIOUS!!!!  Our waitress Danielle was very patient and kind.   I've been to this location once before in college. My Mother Loves the food, I'm not a fan. Yes, the cheesecake is good, but the food lacks flavor. Maybe Im ordering the wrong thing. Of course I'm willing to try again for the sake of my niece. Our next adventure will be Brunch.  Thank you to Danielle for giving my niece an unforgettable experience! She truly enjoyed every bite!",

I had my fiance leave my graduation early (after I crossed the stage of course) so that we could have a table by the end of the ceremony as they do not take reservations on Saturday after 11am. Surprisingly not being busy at all when he arrived he was able to put our names down and was told it would be 1 1/2 hour wait which was ok considering the graduation was not over. Every time we asked how much longer they would tell us it wouldn't be much long until we were seated, not realizing how much time had passed. To make a long story short, we waited 3 1/2 hours to be seated at a table that was not ready (receptionist told us to follow an employee where we would be seated and the table was not ready so we had to stand in front of customers that were eating, employees still putting together tables and chairs that they found around the restaurant and somehow forgot how to count as they didn't have enough for us to sit). After trying to get everyone seated a receptionist who seemed frustrated with having to help put tables together she decided it was ok to talk to us with attitude as if she wanted to start an altercation with a family member of mine. Mind you that WE had been EXTREMELY PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING THE ENTIRE TIME. While this was happening I happened to glance down at my silverware that was placed in front of me, only to find that it had someone else's leftover food (possibly spinach) on the fork! At that point I made the decision to leave. My mother spoke to the manager who handled us in a careless way as if he had NO CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING AT ALL, he did nothing to accommodate us. My advice to Cheesecake Factory is, DO NOT TELL CUSTOMERS YOU CAN HANDLE A LARGE PARTY IF IT IS SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE. We went over to Maggiano's where we were literally seated within 10 minutes, enjoyed our meals with no problems from the delightful staff who congratulated me and gave not only a complementary dessert but I was offered a job as a Pastry Chef ( I graduated from Johnson & Wales). My family and I have been loyal customers to this establishment for as long as I can remember but this experience put a bad taste in our mouths. We will not return to this location and I am making it known that this place clearly needs help.",

After 20 minutes, we were finally served our drinks and delicious bread and butter. Our food came about 40 minutes after we ordered which was pretty annoying. I had Salmon, mashed potatoes, and broccoli which was just ok. The salmon had a nice sear but was lacking a bit of seasoning. The mashed potatoes were amazing but the broccoli was cold and hard. My grandparents and aunt and uncle all had the avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. They all liked the buffalo blasts but the avocado egg rolls were not so great. Then the complications happened, my aunt asked for ranch because she didn't like the blue cheese the buffalo blasts came with and my grandmother asked for a salad since she said the food was too greasy for her. We waited 20 minutes and got nothing, so we told the manager. Nothing either after 10 minutes. FINALLY, we got our ranch and salad and they told us sorry and didn't charge us for it. Overall, I wasn't impressed by The Cheesecake Factory so I don't really recommend it.",

This go round I had the lunch special, spicy Cesar salad and grilled Brussels sprouts and it was really good. In addition, the drink, was extra good, also a summer special. It had tiki in the name which was really cute.",

    "text": "Considering I wasn't expecting much from America's most unhealthy restaurant, I have to admit, I walked out not totally put-off. So, first, the obvious... Yes, this place is way over priced. And yes, most dishes have an average of 1,000,000 calories. But, I looked a little harder at their novel of a menu and discovered their \"skinnylicious\" offerings. I question how some of these items (fried samosas, I'm looking at you!) are considered skinnylicious, but I'll let that go for now.   I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. The menu touts it as less than 590 calories. I wonder how many servings come on the plate though... It had 3 chicken breasts, for crying out loud! Anywho, I ate about half the plate and boxed the rest to go. It was tasty, with LOTS of oven roasted cherry tomatoes, capers, asparagus and artichoke. Expensive at $16.95 though! The price you pay for less calories? Go figure.   I landed here on an office outing. While I wouldn't ever choose it myself, I also might not shudder at the thought of going back if the need ever arises again.",

    "text": "I love Cheesecake Factory so don't get me wrong as this review is totally about this experience. I have been a regular customer to the Cheesecake Factory in Kansas. However this Charlotte one was my first experience.  I didn't mind waiting for 1 hr 15 mins and didn't mind the fading lights. Lights were very dim to read the menu comfortably but I didn't mind as I knew what I wanted to order. I always start with Avocado egg rolls as they are my favorite. However they weren't as crispy as I have had them earlier, it seemed they were sitting on the kitchen counter for around 10 mins after being fried. Which resulted in the lack of crispness.   For the entree I wished to try a new item, the ratatouille toast. The presentation was beautiful and appetizing. The ratatouille was delightful however the toast was burnt and very dry. It was hard to eat but thinking about my prior experience with Cheesecake Factory I gave it a go hoping that the next piece would be better. But I realized it was hopeless cause. This was reported to the manager and he offered to replace it but by then I just lost my appetite. He took it off the bill which was a kind gesture. I wouldn't have mind paying for it as its all about the having a good experience.  For desserts it was lemoncello cream torte, which is a masterpiece. Refreshing lemon mascarpone cheese sandwiched between moist vanilla cake topped with streusel.",

The only bad part is, the selection is overwhelming. If you can even consider that a bad thing?   When I go, I usually stick to a pasta dish or their meatloaf. Which is my favorite thing there. For their appetizers, I recommend the lettuce wraps.   Expect to wait if you don't make a reservation, but if you get there early enough, or at an \"off\" hour, you won't be waiting long.

    "text": "so, we had a pretty bad experience tonight.  my husband took me here tonight for my birthday. he planned this for a while.  we get there at 8:30pm. we were politely greeted and immediately say. first thing, something I have noticed before but didn't write a review because we've never had a bad experience, but the FLOOR. the floor here is SO slick you can easily fall and get seriously hurt, so a message to corporate: fix this before you find yourself in a lawsuit.  now to the overall experience which is why I'm here. now off the gate, our waiter was good and our drinks were 8.5/10 so no complaints there. the food though? my husband ordered the filet and I ordered the shrimp/steak combo. my husband ordered his steak medium and I ordered mine medium rare. once we received our food and cut into them, my husband's steak was closer to rare but he ended up keeping it, but left about 3/4 uneaten because once it cooled off he found it an edible. my (medallions, not actually steak which the menu didn't say) were WELL done. I sent them back and said I would just take the filet and pay the difference. the waiter politely said he would do that. we waited close to 20min. to get my replate, once I cut into it, it was so rare that it was cool in the center. once again, sent the plate back. got the 2nd once back much faster but after waiting and was better. but after waiting so long to eat, I really wasn't hungry anymore so I took a few bites and took it to go. both times, the waiter brought the plates, never spoke to a manager yet two different ones cleared our plates without a word about the food.  my husband ordered a whole cheesecake that we after found out they only had a few slices left of, which we ended up getting anyway. my husband proceeded to pay and I went to the restroom which, was disgusting.  the first two toilets were clogged, trash on the floor, and no soap in one of the dispensers, hardly any in the other.   overall, just not a good night for us at the cheesecake factory.",

We were seated and our waiter seemed very nice at first and told us to take our time and soak in everything. I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious.  I was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all. This was a huge disappointment because like I said I had super high expectations coming in.     Bad Service aside, the Cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! Oh My Goodness, My husband tried the original cheesecake, but I had to go all in. I got the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.  Yes it was a completely fat *ss item, but it was so worth it. I would stay on the elliptical all day to have that once a week.   Overall it was an ok experience.  The food was AMAZING, but the service was very disappointing. :( I will definitely  give it another try and for sure at least get some cheesecake to go.",

    "text": "The Cheesecake is to die for!  Of course---very yummy!  The rest of the food was pretty good too.    Hostess, Bartender and Server not so much!  I get that this is a busy restaurant and the Host/Hostess are met everyday probably with giving people long wait times, but being pleasant goes a long way. When you immediately start fidgeting with your computer screen punching in buttons with a stressed frown on your face, thankful our parents who have never been to Cheesecake Factory didn't have to endure this rude greeting.  Next, it's on to the bar for a couple glasses of wine and a virgin daquiri (we told the bartender before we ordered we would make it worth his while :)  -- expected that to get a little friendly response.  No instead an abrupt stomp off to make it.  Comes back we ask for a wine list and bartender seems annoyed we are not ordering food.  Ask about the house chardonnay and he tells me it\"s compared to Beringer--blick!  That's a first!  So we get our wine and settle up immediately, we were going to hang out, but we felt very unwelcome here.  Decide to sit outside for the rest of our wait, the seating outside is really nice and it was a nice night.  Finally, the buzzer rings and it's on to dinner.  Waiter is pleasant enough but, seems frazzled and not overly friendly.  Takes our drink orders, brings them back with bread basket.  Takes our order and app order.   App comes out, probably good time to make sure everyone has drinks still... nope.  He disappears then, apparently at this restaurant there are no food runners so, the waiter is also responsible for getting your food out to you too.  Seems like a BIG mistake to me--unless your organized and a good waiter/waitress.   We were a party of 6 and like I said first time our parents had ever been here and we were hoping to treat them to a good evening.  So half of our party got our food right away, the other half waited and waited (typically at most restaurants when food comes out seperate like that it is expected that the rest of the tables food is coming up right?).  We saw our waiter take another order, before he got the rest of our food.  No checkback really, and definitely no drink refills, unless  you count the time I flagged him down.  When our waiter finally came back to the table, ingredients from my salad were missing, had to get waiter to go ask for those items.    Like I said food was good enough and cheesecake was awesome, but for what you pay to eat at this place and the wait, you expect better service!  There are a ton of great restaurants in our area and for us this is not one we will be in a hurry to return to.  Best part, we also get the impression that the people who work there don't really care if you come back!",

They need recliners in this place for situations like this! The meatloaf was wonderful. It came with brown gravy which I normally don't like on my meatloaf but this brown gravy wasn't your normal everyday gravy. It was in a class by itself. My friend's food tasted great as well. Yeah I ate some of her food. Don't judge me. Lol. The flavor her dish had was spectacular! I will order that the next time. Now we're full and need to walk it off. Heading into the mall for a little shopping. Until next time my fellow Yelpers... Peace and chicken grease...",

    "text": "HUGE disappointment. We had an extremely poor experience on Sun 10/15. Our server forgot our bread, did not bring us appetizer plates for our appetizer, then my husband's beef was very undercooked. When reported to the server she replied that \"they won't do anything because there's less than half left\" She, herself realized this was a ridiculous statement as demonstrated when she nervously glanced at the plate which was 95% full and only a couple of bites taken. She had already passed by the table a couple of times, glanced at his plate and never once asked if his meal was ok. I ordered the same entree and also had undercooked meat but less so than my husband, however even though there was also a good portion of my meal remaining she did not ask how mine was and if I was satisfied. She proceeded to ask if we wanted dessert, then brought the dessert before clearing the dinner plates, and without fresh utensils or napkins.  We'd have requested a manager on the spot but we were in with our daughter who is only home for the weekend and we chose to try and enjoy the remainder of the meal with her. Katelyn was our server and her service was awful and she should be coached. I will be contacting a manager tomorrow, Monday.  What a wasted of time and money.",

    "text": "Suggested Cheesecake Factory for a birthday dinner meetup with family from out of town.  We've been coming to CF for years, all over the country for several reasons.  One, variety of the menu.  Two, consistency.  Three, convenience.  You don't go to CF for its uniqueness or specialty menu, you go because you know exactly what you (should) be getting . . . This local CF failed at 2 out of 3 tonight.   Convenience: 30-45 minute wait at 5:50 pm on Sunday that was every bit of 45 minutes, yet plenty of open tables in our section.  Understaffed perhaps.  Followed by excessively slow service.  Forgotten items (missed an app and a side), too long to take orders, too long to bus the table, if at all mid service.  Water refills nonexistent.  This is restaurant 101 stuff.  Consistency: failed here too.  Steak undercooked and cold (credit where due, at least it wasn't overcooked), menu items I've had elsewhere simply not the same (a cardinal sin of the dreaded chain restaurant), and in one case the dish was served with a significantly different setup than described on the menu.  All prepared with minimal adequacy.  It was edible but nothing remarkable or even good by CF standards.  Saw another table leave in frustration after walking up to the service station for a drink refill for the same reasons: slow, incompetent service.  I guess what this Cheesecake Factory has going for it is an anchor location in the local high end mall and a captured audience.  They simply do not need to perform at restaurant fundamentals to continue as a business, people will still fill the place up.  Which is a shame, because CFs can be quite good, when they're not failing at basic functions.  Do yourselves a favor and walk over to many of the other almost as close options so this store can just end it already and give up the space to someone who will execute as if they care about their customers.",

I'm almost certain that had to be a fire hazard. Told to come back 30-45 minutes to just get the notifier or my spot would be not in the que anymore. Came back and told another hour and forty five minutes. Total elapsed time to be seated, two hours and fifteen minutes. Our waitress came and was below average for that fancy of a restaurant. Rushed us and came back with my fiances drink in and out of the cup. Got snappy when i asked for clarification on the menu.   Maybe they should consider reservations because the two to three hour wait times are asinine and poor world class service. Another tip, hire staff that will provide world class service. As someone who has worked in customer service for 3 years, this was not world class service. I probably wont be returning and be taking my business elsewhere where i feel valued.",

Order was taken quickly and the drinks/bread also quickly. That's were the good service ends. Ten, fifteen, twenty, then thirty minutes pass with no food, and no explanation or apology. Waiter only seemed concerned with chatting with friends at a nearby table. At the fourty minute mark, I left. He started to speak like he would be bringing the check for the drink then changed his mind. Offered to send a manager to the front to meet me, but after ten minutes of waiting and watch him goof off with other staff members, I left. I wont cross this restaurant off completely, but if they seat you and your waiter has a man bun, ask to change to another server.",

First the table was not wiped when we sat down. I normally let stuff like that go so I wiped it off myself. Next the waitress spilled cream all over the table. No biggie, stuff happens. Next, she brought our iced water and coffee, the water mugs were filthy!  I sent them back. Our coffee cups were empty soon and I had to ask for a refill, when she came back mine was somewhere between luke- warm and cold.  The manager and five servers were standing within 20 feet of me, I waved and waved not one came.  I tried again and finally a server came, I asked for the manager.  I told him we were having a lack-luster experience this morning and then told him I can not tolerate cold coffee.  He smirked, did not apologize and said he would send us more coffee.  They did, mine was so hot it scaled my tongue.  I guess they heated it in the microwave. There were flies buzzing around our table and others during all this.  Finally it was time to leave, I put a $25 gift card and a credit card in the folder, when the waitress brought it back, no credit card.  I was looking all around for it and another waitress came up and said excuse me sir, is this yours?  It had been left in the machine. Needless to say we will not be returning to the CKF anytime soon.  Maybe KFC would be better..... For the manger, don't smirk at your customers when they complain in a civilized manner.  Offer your sincere apology and ask if there is anything you can do to make it right.  This may give them pause to think about coming back...",

I came here with a group of friends weeks ago for a get together. I just ordered a drink and my brother ordered a cheesecake and calamari which I shared with. The calamari wasn't bad as it was deep fried like any other restaurant that serves calamari.  Cheesecake was wonderful, apple caramel streusel. It was sweet but it wasn't to the point where my mouth was dry (then again I had Long Islands that helped me wash it down.) One of my other friends ordered a burger, and honestly to come here to order a burger isn't really a bright idea. The portions are definitely not worth the amount that you're paying, however this is a \"high class\" restaurant.  And be sure to watch out on the floors. They're super greasy/slippery, as soon as you walk out of the main area and to your chairs. It seems as if you're walking on some dried oil or grease, it's kind of nasty to not think that they would not mop the floors every night.  Overall, I would give it a 2.5/5 but since Yelp has stars I'll round it and give it a 3, just because that cheesecake was pretty good. But, you won't find me a regular here.",
