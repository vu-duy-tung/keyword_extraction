Once they were ready to go, the line was long immediately, but they moved rather quickly.  I ordered the Connecticut Roll; the Lobster Tots; and a Whoopie Pie.  The roll and tots were amazing! I was surprised that I enjoyed the lobster tots as much as I did. They were actually really flavorful. ...he whoopie pie I can live without... For a food truck my order was kinda pricey, but all things considered I will definitely add this truck to my 'Favs' list.  :-)",

    "text": "Finally made it to Cousins food truck for their famous lobster roll.  Having lived and traveled extensively in New England, I've eaten my fair share of lobster rolls in Maine and Massachusetts. I think the price is just fine and had no issue with the price, as most lobster rolls are over $20. My main issue was the roll itself, too much mayonnaise (I got the Maine Roll) and roll was soggy and did not have great flavor.  A perfect Maine lobster roll should have just a touch of mayonnaise and served on a crispy buttered split top roll.  The lobster portion was very good but the flavor was just ok. It tasted like some fresh and some not so fresh lobster meat (some of the texture was off too).  For a few extra dollars, there are better lobster rolls in Charlotte.  Edit and response to owner- hi Michele- thanks for responding.  Besides the goop I'd mayo, I would also check the freshness of the lobster. Some of the bites were off in taste and texture. This was uptown on Tryon on July 31",

My coworker paid for \"2\" additional sides of lobster that's an extra $10 and got an 8 oz container which would be fine but half way down she found shredded lettuce is what filled the remainder of the cup. Not cool for a $30 plus lunch ... Lots of other places for Lobster now in uptown I don't  expect lobster to be cheap but they jip you for sure ...  First time and most likely last time  ...   since i can't respond to a response. How many ounces of lobster can you expect as I don't see that any where ??",

I took pictures but my wife deleted them because she formed a bond with the guy running the food truck for some reason. This was a waste of $14.50 plus tax and I know she tipped. I would never eat here again. Let me also say I think all the brewery's we have been to and we go to a lot them the food truck food is  all sub par at best at every one",

The size of the rolls were comical for being $17 each; after looking at the prices initially, we considered eating elsewhere because it is more than we'd usually pay for a sandwich, but decided to stick it out because of the food trucks good reputation.  I understand lobster is an expensive food, but I have had better quality lobster rolls at better quality establishments for a much better price... the experience was disappointing to say the least.

On a positive note, the wait wasn't too crazy.  However, the lobster was a very mushy texture and flavor-less.  None of that sweet buttery flavor you expect.  Seems like it was defrosted and sitting around too long.  A lobster roll lives and dies on the strength of the lobster and this was really lacking.    My roll was room temp and no mayo.  Huh?  This definitely was not a Maine lobster roll and not worth $18.   Bottom line: bland, frozen, over-priced, over-hyped.",

This place was awesome, but tonight they were a part of the Cotswold Trucks Food Truck Rally and I think they were suffering from a mild case of \"In the Weeds.\" Still, they delivered in several regards and I see this place doing outstanding here in the QC.  Yes, they were on shark tank. Uh huh, celebrities have endorsed them. Ok ok, they have a ton of different media logos all over their truck. Hype, hype, hype. I don't care what Mariah Carey thinks, I just want the food!   The rally started at 5:30 and I was there as soon as it started. Sure enough, the new kids on the block already had a line 30-deep and they were churning out food as fast as they could. To my surprise, they were really hustling as the line was moving at a steady pace. When I got to the window I ordered the Lobster Tacos with a cup of New England Clam Chowder.  Wait was about 10 minutes for my order and since this visit was more on a whim, I took my food to my car. First off, Chowder: Wonderful, Velvety, Hot, Fresh. It seemed that every bite had some clam in it, they definitely didn't skimp out on it, and it was seasoned masterfully. Wonderful job on the chowder.  My tacos looked and tasted unbelievably fresh. I think that if 10 years ago you told someone you were going to a church parking lot at night to eat seafood from a big van, they'd think you'd lost it! Nevertheless, this was very, very fresh food! You could pick out every individual note of the pico, and the cilantro-lime sauce was perfect. This is where my review could have been a slam dunk, but fell just a bit short. At first I thought the sauce just wasn't strong and the dish lack seasoning, however as I looked at my tacos, I noticed that two tacos were only partially topped in the sauce. The third taco had only one little drop of the sauce, and it really showed in the overall package. This sauce is the linchpin in the whole dish: Salty, savory, a bit of acidity, the entire dish relies on it for seasoning and every bite needs a bit of it. That final taco missing all but one little drop of sauce was somewhat of a disappointment.   I attest this oversight to the insane line they had tonight. Under more ideal conditions I'm sure this wouldn't be the case. I can tell that they're very passionate about what they're doing and you can't say they aren't putting their all in the effort. Tonight's sample of the menu has me wanting more. I'm a believer, and a follower... Just, keep me interested!",

We got the Connecticut roll, lobster grilled cheese, a cup of clam chowder, a whoopie pie, and drink. The roll was packed full of lobster on a buttery bun, but there was only a faint lemon butter taste. I also fished out three bits of shell from my roll in three separate bites, which is a serious choking hazard if the roll had been given to the family in front of us in line, who had two small kids. The grilled cheese was my favorite, but it wasn't as packed with lobster as the rolls. The chowder was tasty and full of clam, so worth every penny. The whoopie pie was a prepackaged chocolate cake/frosting sandwich. Value-wise, I say the rolls are the best bang for your buck, but you just have to be careful with chewing and watch out for shells.",

It was DELICIOUS. take this from a girl who LOVES her Florida lobster. Now, you may think it ridiculous to wait 90 mins in line for a palm-sized sandwich. Normally I would never wait that long for food in general. But, we were at a brewery, as is common for a Saturday afternoon in Charlotte, and had the entertainment of live music and great co versatiles with friends to get us through. They operated on a limited menu, expecting floods of people. service was extremely quick. Our lobster rolls (I had a Maine and a Connecticut) were out before I even finished paying. The nest was tender, juicy and wrapped in a toasted piece of bread that was buttered to perfection.    I can't wait to try them again (hopefully one Friday for lunch) and experience the other menu items. Lobster tots looked incredible and the lobster quesadilla looked divine.

The cheeses they used was perfect for a grilled cheese sandwich. My boyfriend got their shrimp tacos and he gobbled that down before I was able to finish my sandwich, so I'm assuming it was delicious. He said it was very flavorful.",

The lobster roll was on a buttery toasty bun and it was delicious. Had a good amount of lobster on it and you can taste the acidic from the lemon that was lightly squeezed on it. Delicious! The tots were hot and tasty especially when you add the seasoning that they had for it - maybe some kind of Cajun seasoning nor seafood seasoning. My son liked his cheese quesadilla because it had a lot of cheese on it which he loves. Can't go wrong with that. It was prepared fast too.",

That said, if price is an issue, just get a lobster roll and go to Harris Teeter to get yourself a bag of chips.  We did a team lunch order with 10+ orders and all the food came out really well. Counsins took the care to wrap up everything for us and label it, so a plus there.  All that said, a few items of improvements... please be there on time. The food truck came late and had credit card machine issues after opening late, resulting in customers waiting in the heat for 30 minutes past the scheduled open before even being able to order.  We had a large order and would have been willing to submit it online or call ahead, early. Understanding the logistics difficulty potentially, but why not allow for some online orders and develop a queuing system?  All that said, good classic lobster rolls for a reasonable price. Check them out.",

We got a Maine roll, a CT roll, a CT roll sans bun, and a lobster quesadilla. The CT roll sans but was just lettuce dumped in a soup container. Have some pride in your presentation and put it over some lettuce or something! Part of me thinks I'd like to give them another try, but I'm not convinced it's worth it.",

I would understand the hype and price if it was flavorful, but there was absolutely no taste to the rolls. I get that lobster will cost you more than your average meal but the food is overpriced for what you get. The lobster bisque was pretty good but don't expect a huge portion for what you pay.",

I wasn't interested in the grilled cheese or tater tots, etc., just the lobster roll please........correction the Connecticut Lobster Roll, as it is served warmed and without mayo.......yes, that one........$17 bucks! Ouch! But I get it, it's lobster and I had no problems with the price tag after devouring that roll, it was really good, really fresh, really sweet on a buttery toasted roll!    Several weeks later they were near my building during lunch and I tried them again, getting the same Connecticut roll, but this time my bread was soggy and several pieces of lobster shell was present, so I was very disappointed after dropping $17 this time around.  So, I still think the other lobster truck has my heart for now, as they are more consistent.  I am willing to try Cousin's a 3rd time but I will need some time before I forget about that soggy bread and several pieces lobster shell pieces I had to take out of my mouth.",

Did a good job by both of getting it out on social media.   I have never had a lobster roll nor been up north so I don't have anything to compare it too either.    I knew being on a food truck it was not going to be cheap and it's lobster right.   I ordered the Connecticut roll and lobster tacos. The Connecticut roll was very tasty and full of flavor. The tacos were alright, think may have been missing a little of the sauce as another review mentioned because they seemed a little dry.    Overall was a great experience, the food was great and the service was great.  From order to pick up was around 10 minutes.   I will agree with other reviews that it is expensive, the tacos are reasonably priced at $14.50. The rolls at 16.95 could be a couple inches longer for that price. Again, I have no complaints everything was great but it would be hard to frequent too often at that price.",

This food truck has become a regular at my job's business park so on a recent visit, I was excited to give them a try.   Full disclosure: I've never had a lobster roll before this truck so I have absolutely nothing else to compare it to.  When I arrived, there wasn't much of a line so I placed my order for the Connecticut lobster roll and waited 10 minutes, tops. They have a large screen TV in the middle of the truck that lists their menu items for the day. The total just for the roll was $19 plus change. By no means a cheap lunch. Once my name was called, I grabbed my roll and sprinkled the seasoning they had on their counter as well dropped a few drops of their hot sauce.  I dug in and was pleased at how much lobster they stuffed in the roll (I mean, for $19 this should be expected). Although I was surprised that the roll was on the shorter side. I expected a much bigger size, especially for the price. The bread was slightly toasted and generously buttered. It definitely held up against all of the lobster. I probably could have eaten the roll by itself.  The seasoning that I sprinkled on top definitely made it for me. I cannot imagine how bland the roll tastes without it. I would recommend a very healthy sprinkle of that stuff if you find yourself at the truck.  For my first time trying a lobster roll, I was definitely satisfied.  When the truck makes another visit, I'll probably try the lobster tots.",

I was in love but I wish I would  have asked for the toppings on the side because too much pico, not enough sauce. I also got the lobster bisque since I didn't know if I would ever have the opportunity again. My friend got the roll and clam chowder and I hate to admit it but his soup won. It was so good!   I highly recommend checking them out but grab a beer and come good company while you wait in line and just remember it's worth the wait.",

People in line were like a cult following them around from location to location and eager to talk about their favorite fare. I heard about the chowder, tacos and quesadillas over and over again.   I went with the Maine lobster roll and it was so good! The roll was toasted and buttered and filled with fresh, cold hunks of lobster. The Mayo was barely detectable but definitely added flavor.   I can't post this review without talking about how much they have their act together. I have been to a lot food trucks and the main theme is waiting. Not here. There was a line to order and it moved quickly. I was super impressed at how fast our order was ready.    I'm really looking forward to eating here again and I understand why fans go to them now.",

    "text": "I'd been waiting for Wednesday all week because i'd been craving a Lobster Roll. Expecting to see my go to truck on the schedule at the Whitehall lunch rally, I was disappointed to see that they wouldn't be there. But excited to see there was another option. Walking up to the truck there was a crowd surrounding it. Checking out the menu, I loved the variation in options!! I was excited to try everything, but I narrowed it to 2 options, and just ordered both :-). I ordered the Lobster Grilled Cheese Sandwich Combo #2 (Tots & Drink), and the Connecticut Lobster Roll.   The wait wasn't long at all. I walked to the car to clear my hands so I could carry my food, by the time I returned my food was ready. Before walking away I season my food with what looked like Old Bay but could have also been a different cajun type seasoning, I couldn't tell. I also grabbed a few pieces of foil and more Ketchup. It was pretty annoying how stingy they were with the Ketchup. 2 packs for a full basket of tots? Then when asking for more, I unfortunately only got 2 more.  Now it's time to eat and I was excited. Everything was still really warm, I only work a couple minutes away. Starting with the tots, they were a little disappointing, but I already knew that from the one I tasted before wrapping them up. Lacked salt & weren't crispy at all. Thank goodness for the seasoning they had there which made them edible. The Lobster Roll was ok. It was pretty dry and lacked that punch of lobster flavor that I wanted. Needed a bit more butter and salt. The Grilled Cheese was the star for me. Plenty of lobster between 2 buttery slices of bread and melted cheese. It was yummy.   All in all it wasn't bad, but not enough for me to neglect the Lobster Dogs  Food Truck... except for the Grilled Cheese. They are also more expensive than Lobster Dogs at $16.95 vs Lobster Dogs $15. But I would give them another try being that they are still pretty new and finding their flow, especially since soon they will be a regular at my job every other Wednesday!",

I realize this is a unicorn event as this truck has their own following and people flock to wherever this bad boy parks.   Got the infamous lobster tots and they were delicious! I was a little disappointed in the amount of lobster in the tots- I think the truck in Raleigh serves more in this dish. Maybe my lobster luck ran out that day.   Just a heads up: This is a more pricey food truck but remember their main ingredient is lobster.",

    "text": "Prior to taking our trip to Maine, we figured we might as well try out one of those fancy lobster rolls, right here in Charlotte, so when we noticed they would be out and about and we would be nearby, we stopped at the truck.  First, the setup: Food trucks can be notoriously difficult to track down. On this front, Cousins is firing on all cylinders. They were where they said they would be, and it was easy to find that information.  Next, the truck itself: As is probably to be expected from a more high-profile business, they are not skimping. Rather than a lunch wagon variety, there is no shortage of touting that you've seen them on TV, and their menu is broadcast not on chalkboards, but on monitors on the outside. All in all, it's an impressive display. That alone does not make for a good meal, but it's a definite difference from what many other food trucks may show you with their first impression, to be sure.  Then you get to the ordering. This one can be a challenge, simply because everyone wants to see that \"Shark Tank Food Truck\". Frankly, I can take it or leave it. Sure, I was also in that line, but I was more interested because we were headed on our trip to Maine than the fact that they were on Shark Tank - that's just a bonus. Or a headache, such as it is. In this case, it can make for a long line. The good news is that the line generally movies quickly - at least to order.  After placing the order, however, it can move a bit more slowly. That isn't really news to anyone who has ordered off a food truck - then can always be slow, and on this case it wasn't any worse than any other food truck, and in fact it was probably better than most.  When it came to the food - it was a smallish sandwich, which can be disconcerting if you're paying up for something like lobster (or lobster grilled cheese - they are both rather pricey). But the taste was solid, at least the same as what we had on our Maine road trip. So if you don't want to go to Maine and get one, it's probably worth it. I mean it's not coming out of the water that morning, but you also probably didn't spend a few hundred (thousand?) dollars to get there and get your roll, did you?",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Cousins Maine Lobster ever since I saw it on Shark Tank. One day, I did a little research and saw that the truck would be visiting near my office. A bunch of us decided to check it out.   The food- takes forever. It was about 25 minutes from order to getting the food. By the time I got it, I was even more disappointed. I have had many a lobster roll in my life, so I know what I should reasonably expect. Unfortunately,  this one was drenched in a TON of watery mayo. The lobster was flavorless and didn't taste fresh. I can't really explain the lobster except not good seafood.  The roll was very soggy too. It was not crisp or buttered. I hate to say this, but Hickory Tavern makes a way better lobster roll than these guys and you don't have to wait outside on the curb for your food. Its comparable in price, but includes a side.   I wasn't full after eating my lobster roll, so I ended up adding some tots to my order. I didn't have to wait as long for those (took about 5 mins).  Those were good! They were fresh and good portion.",

The only downfall is the wait you'll have to stand in whenever this truck rolls around. I went to Sycamore Brewings Summer Fest just to get one of these rolls and waited in a like for over 2 hours. Yes. 2. Hours. Worth it? Yes (plus hey hey, sipping a couple brews made it not so bad). But holy cow. For a relatively simple recipe it was a little insane. I've been fortunate to grow up in the North East and miss authentic lobster rolls so much. Cousins falls right in line with the best, just mind the line ;)",

The menu features a variety of lobster rolls, Connecticut (mayo) and Maine (buttered)  both with tater tots if desired (extra cost), lobster grilled cheese, lobster bisque and New England clam chowder  just to name a few items. I ordered a deconstructed lobster salad (  plain lobster with a side of mayo) plus the lobster bisque. My dining mate ordered the lobster roll ( on a toasted roll) Our lobster meat tasted fresh , sweet and tender. The soup was delicious. In my opinion both overpriced for the quantity. About $17.00 for the roll, $6.00 for the  small cup of soup I have no idea whether the lobster was previously frozen but the taste was  very fresh. Indeed a treat for me and my dining mate who used to vacation yearly on Cap Cod and enjoyed lobster as well as other New England seafood.",

There were visible strips of claw and knuckle meat, and each roll was overflowing with lobster meat. The Maine Lobster roll was served cold and a light touch of mayo. The Connecticut Lobster roll was served hot. The lemon and butter added a rich dimension to the lobster. I literally inhaled both rolls, but each were extremely delicious. The Lobster bisque was rich and creamy.  Even on a hot day, the bisque was quite filling. The service was fast and polite.  There was not much of a wait time between the order and receiving the order. I would highly recommend going back. I did note that there was some discussion on which Lobster Roll was the best.   I recommend getting both and determining which one is right for you.",

However, we ended up catching it outside of Good Works cidery, where the line was very short. They have anything with lobster you can think of....lobster tacos, lobster tots, lobster tail, lobster bisque, lobster rolls, lobster quesadilla.   My husband and I settled on the Connecticut lobster roll as I do not love mayo much and the Connecticut roll is just butter! Yum! After about 10 minutes, our roll was ready. This roll was FULL of lobster. They definitely didn't skimp. The flavor was delicious and the lobster chunks were large. My only complaint is that I wish the roll could have been bigger. Like, keep the same lobster amount but spread it out over a larger roll.   Overall, the prices are on the higher end. Our roll with tip and tax was $19. However, they definitely give you your moneys worth in lobster!  Can't wait to return to try the lobster tacos!",

The Lobster was hot, fresh and savory...and per my custom request, they sprinkled some cheese on to my Roll, making it just about perfect. The Tater Tots were piping hot and perfectly fried...making it just as delicious!   I will say, however, that it was extremely overpriced (nearly 20 bucks for a roll)...especially for a fairly small-sized roll. If the roll was a tad bigger, I'd definitely rate it 5 stars.

I first tried them at a lobster event @ Sycamore Brewing (another Charlotte must-have) & was fortunate enough to have them yesterday when they popped up in Uptown.

I made the stop after work and was surprised that there weren't a lot of ppl in line. However there was consist business throughout my visit. People keep coming by and ordering.   The couple in front of me order almost $90 worth of food. Meanwhile I was trying to decided if I was going to be nice and order a roll for my mom.  I decided to be nice and got the Connecticut and Maine Lobster Roll.   The order was ready in about 5 minutes. I didn't add anything to the rolls and I kinda regret it. There was a lot of Lobster meat on each roll. I would say that it was well worth the price for the amount of meat you. However there wasn't much flavor to the rolls. The Connecticut Roll tasted like butter because of the buttered toast but the Maine just tasted like cooked lobster. I don't like mayo so I avoided it as best as I could when trying the Maine Lobster Roll. I did like how it wasn't heavily mayonnaisey tho. It was just a thin layer spread on the toast. I think both of the rolls needed a good amount of seasoning and even a few dishes of hot sauce to give it some flavor.   Based on the bland taste I'm not jumping to try another lobster roll but I may give Cousins Maine Lobster Truck another try and get another one of their menu items.

    "text": "We visited Sycamore Brewery in CLT, the Cousins truck was located in the clearing behind the brewery.   We had the lobster tacos, they were a bit small but so so worth it. The lobster was perfect, the sauce was light (not soggy) and the finely chopped toppings were fresh. I only mention the size because if you are sharing- get a side.  We had the loaded tater tops and they were terrific. Lastly we had a chocolate whoppie pie- they are pre packaged from Maine so I was skeptical, but they tasted great and the white icing tasted fresh and fluffy. Big enough too share.  I heard they are starting a Cousins truck in Philly- woo-hoo!!",

I think it's safe to say that experience was limited ( or so I hope) and that it was a small kink in the newness of this particular truck.  I had the CT roll with tots two weeks ago, and my husband had the Lobster Tots.  Neither of us can stop talking about how yummy our food was! Considering the lobster roll is $10.00 cheaper than any local spot, and is top notch compared to most, I am sold!  If you see the truck somewhere local, I say its worth it!!",

The staff was very helpful & friendly.  I had been wanting to try them for a while since I heard a lot of good things and their pictures always like really good. But I will say I was a bit disappointed. I was looking forward to the lobster grilled cheese the most and it was very underwhelming to say the least especially for the price. I also got the Connecticut roll which was also a slight disappointing, it did have a good amount of meat but was bland no taste of butter or lemon at all. I've had my fare share of lobster rolls and definitely had better.  My friend ordered the lobster tots & i got to try them and that was really good probably the best thing on the menu and the only reason I would want to go back. He also got the lobster tail and he enjoyed it.",

    "text": "We are the Cousins Maine lobster food truck while attending the water Lantern Festival in town.  The line was long, although I was pretty impressed with how fast they got the food out.   We ordered a Connecticut roll, lobster grilled cheese, New England clam chowder, whoopie pie, and drink. The Connecticut roll was packed pretty full. However it was pretty bland, and could barely taste any of the butter. There were also several bits of shell and cartilage in the meat. The lobster grilled cheese was delicious, but pretty sparse with the lobster meat, offering only a few small chunks in the middle of the sandwich. The chowder was tasty, and packed with clam meat in almost every bite. The whoopie pie was a prepackaged cake sandwich. Girlfriend seemed to enjoy it though.  Overall I think the prices are too high, especially for the grilled cheese which seemed to have less than half the meat that was in the roll (yet still priced only a couple dollars less than the roll). Also have to fault them for having lobster shells in our meat, when they are supposed to specialize in lobster.",

From quesadillas to lobster tacos!   Lobster tots and the lobster grilled cheese were my favorite. They also offer New England clam chowder which looked great and for dessert whoopie pies. Although I was disappointed on the size of the lobster roll. I understand Lobster is expensive but I expected a slightly bigger roll for $16.95. Also, the roll didn't come with a lemon wedge which could have possibly gave it flavor to the roll. For the first time customers; warning It is pricey. With 3 items (pictures down below) the total was $49 and change.   I haven't seen such a clean and mean looking food truck! Like wow! with tv screens showing pictures of different items in the menu. You could only imagine how much cleaner the inside is.   The price and the portion ratio plays a role if I'll actually buy something at this food truck. It was delicious but will probably hesitate to buy next time.",

We got a Connecticut Lobster Roll, a Lobster Grilled Cheese, Lobster Tots, and a cup of Lobster Bisque. Overall I wasn't very impressed. The lobster roll was probably my favorite, but nothing super special. I felt like I could have made the grilled cheese at home (minus lobster). The tots were ok, but it was a weird combination of cuisines (Mexican toppings with lobster). I really didn't like the lobster bisque. After I finished the grilled cheese, I didn't eat the rest of the soup.   Overall, I guess I just felt like the food was mediocre and very expensive. I know lobster is expensive, so if the food had been really good, the $55 meal would not have bothered me.   I might be the only one, but the quality to price ratio didn't cut it for me.",

I can almost smell the fresh salt water in the air! We also ordered quesadillas but feel like the  presentation of the cheese is way to much and strong, made the lobster a minor.  And the wait time, OMG we waited more than 2 hours (this is Catawba brewing Company in Asheville) to order, wondering why??? Please do something to fix it!",

There was a small downside and that was the buns needed a little more butter and longer toasting. A little more butter on the lobster.  And of course I wanted much more lobster.    I'm really thinking of Ballentine on Monday 4th to try the lobster totes. And the grilled cheese sounds interesting.",

I absolutely love a good lobster roll, and I've had the pleasure of eating some awesome ones along the coast up North. Perhaps it was just a bit too hyped up for me, and I was expecting the delicious lobster rolls that I've had in the past, but unfortunately it was just so so. The lobster was very tough and the flavor that I was expecting just wasn't there. It was definitely overpriced for the quality that I received. I'm hoping maybe I just got a bad batch. I might consider giving them a second chance if I see them around town.",

The wait was outrageous - little over an hour and a half. Luckily I was with some good company so it made for solid team bonding. The line just kept getting longer and longer behind us as the evening trickled on - creating a wait of over 2 hours. Now this lobster roll was good, but I would never wait that long for any type of bites. My lobster roll was served chilled with a touch of mayo on a New England style roll. The lobster bits were chewy and I loved the New England style bread. This roll was mini and it didn't last long at all. I only got one, but could easily have devoured 4 of these yummy rolls. Prices are steep for these, but that didn't seem to halt people from splurging at the food truck. At one point they even ran out of buns and had to call for backup. Overall a fun first experience. Looking forward to getting a lobster roll again.",

It was late afternoon, just before they were closing so we hit them with no line. If you're not familiar, Cousins is a franchise that's based out of LA. They gained fame from an appearance on Shark Tank and there are now trucks across the country.  I like that they offer two different types of lobster rolls: Maine (chilled with a touch of mayo) and Connecticut (served warm with butter and lemon). They also have lobster tacos, grilled cheese, quesadilla, and tots. There's also soups, a kid's menu, and gluten free options.   Our order: two Connecticut lobster rolls and two #2 combos (tater tots and a drink). It was delicious. I could probably eat four of them. Now I will warn you, it's pricey. Our total with taxes (but before tip): $45.99. Lobster rolls are $16.95.   Check their website for the schedule and where they will be each day. They do a really great job keeping that updated.",

I have hit up this food truck a few times and I did enjoy the lobster roll but like all the ones I have had it is not very filling to I would add the lobster bisque or the clam chowder for $5 to make it more of a meal but be prepared to pay almost $25 for that little meal:)  So why three stars you ask? Well I really feel it doesn't live up to all the hype. So that is one star and the other I deducted was for the lobster tots! I will say they were more filling that the lobster rolls but the Tex Mex taste in my humble option should never be matched with lobster meat!   If they are at a place I might think about a lobster roll but I will definitely not be seeking  them out any more:)",
