Great wine & beer list. Food: very good. We had the calamari appetizer which was pretty good. My husband had a salad which was so big that he shared it with me (fresh spring lettuce with Gorgonzola). He had the blackened Ribeye and loved it (and is super picky). I had the sashimi tuna. It was ok; had better in other places. We had the chocolate mousse cake (really good!) & the creme brulee (was good, not great). Valet parking was the way to go! We will return! Awesome place. Top brass in pleasing their customers!",

It was no problem and we were promptly seated in a quiet back room with a nice view of the city. Water was served, and we ordered our dinners. I got the tuna. I asked the waitress if she recommended it to which she replied \"Do you like tuna?\" Well...yes, that's why I was thinking of ordering it. She also asked how I liked it cooked without any sort of recommendation. Thankfully I ordered it rare and it came out perfectly. More on that later.  Bread was served 15 minutes or so after ordering. It looked burnt on the outside, but the inside was soft and warm. The honey butter they serve it with is pure gold. Delicious. The tuna came out not long after. It was a huge plate of food--big piece of tuna, slaw, and a sesame rice cake. The tuna itself was delicious and perfectly cooked. The peanut whatever sauce it came with was superb as well. The slaw was excellent but the rice cake it was on top of was eh. It tasted like rice. Nothing too special.  Service was fine. The waitress wasn't the best I've had but most certainly not the worst. The food was good, good location--I'd definitely go back.",

He was always spot on- we had the Bees Knees(yum) fig old fashioned and some excellent kind of daiquiri!  The calamari & crap dip were wonderful!   We had shrimp & grits, sirloin special and just for the halibut.  All were delicious! We had 3 different desserts loved the apple cake & peanut butter cheesecake (and I don't even normally like cheesecake).",

The prices are on the high side as you will spend $20-40 before even getting to drinks and appetizers. However, the prices aren't unwarranted. They do a delicious smoked salmon and caper platter as an appetizer and the three (lower priced) entrees I have had were all terrific and cooked to perfection. There is nothing here that blows me away and leaves me craving my next visit, but it is a great place when you want something a bit more upscale or a place for a special occassion or fancy date.",

Our waiter came right out to take our order and was very attentive. He brought out the drink menu and let me know what kid-friendly drinks they have. Our waiter was very kind, helpful and he wasn't hovering. The atmosphere was so relaxing with the view of the city, the light music playing, and the single candle on the table. The food was wonderful. We ordered the crab dip and the okra as appetizers and they both were delicious. Our main course, I ordered Just for the Halibut, I loved it. My boyfriend orders the lamb, he devoured it. My son ordered from the appetizer menu, the beef medallions. I tried one, they, too, were delicious. We ordered drinks, I believe one was called the bees knees and the other was Dressler's coffee and both were very good. Although, our favorite would have to be Dressler's coffee.   As it cooled off, someone came out to ask if we were comfortable because if not, if we were cold they had different sized capes we could wear to keep warm.   We were impressed. The food, service and atmosphere at this restaurant is what I wish we could have all of the time. We will be coming back and bringing our friends.",

The server said this was their go-to-dish and the reason why people return to Dressler's.  Wife really liked it. It wasn't her favorite fish dish in charlotte as the fish was combined with many other things.  The fish alone was okay but paired with everything it tasted great.  We also ordered and shared a side order of fries which were great as well.   I had the ribeye which is also one of their signature dishes.  Originally wanted it well-done as wife doesn't like undercooked meat (we like to share our dishes).  Based on the server's comment I felt they were going to over do it so I asked them to cook it somewhere between medium well and well done.  Steak came out rare so they took it back, recooked it, and it came back somewhere between medium and medium well.  Was starving at this point so just wanted to eat.  I think we will be back but might try something other than steak.  From first impressions I don't think they are great at cooking steaks. Might go for the halibut or another seafood dish.",

    "text": "LOVE THIS LOCATION!   We got lucky on parking, but it's really the ONLY bad thing about this Midtown spot. View of downtown and the metro vibe, but not the crazy cluster-fudge that is downtown (or is it uptown?)  I had been urged by friends to try Dressler's for a while... Unfortunately the prices are a little high for my household's food game, but thank God for Groupons!! We had a $30 coupon for $60 worth of food, HOLLA!  Aside from the amazing food, the thing that stood out to us the most at Dressler's was the amazing service. Our waiter was so helpful, thoughtful, and fast. Just a shining star in a sea of mediocre waiters. Three thumbs up.  Now back to the food.. DELICIOUS. Really though, the quality of everything was super high and fresh. Our waiter even assured us that the seafood is flown in fresh daily. I didn't have the biggest selection as a vegetarian and I mentioned this to the server AFTER our meal. He felt so bad: \"I wish you would have let me know, we have an entire vegetarian menu and gluten-free menu\". Whoa!   I ordered the Goat Cheese & Garlic Appetizer and G's House Salad as my entree. Both of these were simple but perfect. The Goat Cheese app was very similar to my favorite goat cheese app at 300 east. The one at Dressler's differs in that it's served with a tomato chutney instead of sun-dried tomatoes... I can dig it. I ate every single bite of both my plates.  My boyfriend ordered Just for the Halibut and was blown away. I rarely see him that blissful about food, but this was one of those times.   We ordered the Mom's Carrot Cake  to-go. I can't say it was the best carrot cake in the universe, but i was pretty close.  DEFINITELY COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!",

The cheesecake is completely out of this world. She put a whole lot of love into those delicacies. Everything from the coffee to salads, baked potatoes, and steaks are wonderful and full of flavor. Chef Scott really knows how to cook a steak. And no matter how thick it is, if you order it well-done, don't expect it to be cut open to check if it is done. He is just that good of chef to know when a steak is done without having to gash into it. They have always came out full of juice and so flavorful. The salmon and lamb is also something that is very good here. I have never had anything go wrong here. We love it here.",

I ordered a G's House salad (greens, caramelized onions, apples, sugared walnuts, goat cheese, balsamic vinaigrette) and the Almond NC Trout entree (with mushrooms, asparagus, beurre blanc). I would happily order both again.   Here's where they lost points in my book: Price wise, you're looking at $30+ per person without alcohol so you could say that it's supposed to be upscale dining. A few little things made me feel otherwise.   The server was just un-interested. It took him a while to get to our table to say hello. Then after we ordered drinks and salads, I asked if they had a bread basket. He says, \"Oh, yeah. We do. Do you want some?\" Yup, that's why I'm asking. He brought it and it was cold and stale. The food presentation needs work. (And, please get rid of the cheap diner-style salt and pepper shakers.)  3.5 stars",

As for the food (which is my main focus), I say its 'just ok'.... not worth going out of the way for.  Plus:  The thick 2 inch diameter crab cake ($9 for 1 or $18 for 2) was good.   It isn't the most gigantic crab cake around (in fact, I think it's a bit small).  It has good flavor, lots of real crab meat, not greasy or dry and tasted just right.  Comes with a small handful of salad greens.  Con:  The scallop appetizer ($12) was a disappointment.  I've had MUCH fresher scallop elsewhere.  The 2 scallops are covered with a sweet sauce in disgust but underneath, the texture of the scallops seemed to indicate they've sat around for awhile causing the meat to toughen and lose moistness.  The underlying overly salted taste of the muscle is probably from the scallops sitting in a salty water bath too long.  The preparation is also a failure.   It isn't seared to crispy on the outside as it should.  For the money, I'd NOT recommend spending it on 2 underwhelming scallops.  I also got a salad which is decent but nothing to write home about.  All salads are $5, which I think is very reasonablely priced compared to other items on the menu.   As for service, my waitress was attentive and helpful and genuinely nice - thumbs up.  I'd say this is a good place for business/social dinners due to it's decor and comfortable setting.  But I'm the type that doesn't mind hole-in-the-walls as long as the food is superb - so this place is not for me.",

It's called the \"Hollywood Table\", which has a very high back, stained glass around the top of the high back, situated in a corner away from everyone else, and overlooks uptown! Gorgeous! I also asked if they could buy a dozen roses and place it on the table. And they did ... and didn't even charge us! Their wine selection was superb (Annalisa Moscato). They gave us dessert for free and even a free dessert to take home! Highly recommend to all!",

In fact the owner, Jon even came by our table last time I was there to introduce himself.  You won't find that at too many upscale restaurants.  If you're looking for great food and welcoming atmosphere I would recommend that you definitely check out Dressler's!",

The tuna appetizer was also outstanding and I could have had it as a meal - it was beautiful.  Crab cake entree was really great too - so many places have nasty crab cakes with mostly breading.  Hubby had pork chop which looked great.   We've been here twice now, and plan to go back soon!  Food is truly lovely.  We've had good service both times as well.",

Must have driven by  it a couple dozen times, shopping at Traders Joes, and never once noticed it there.  Needless to say, I regret not knowing about this place until now. They seemed comfortable handling such a large party, and judging by the party rooms in the back of the restaurant they have plenty of practice! I can't for the life of me remember our servers names (2 gentlemen) but they handled everything great. Each server basically had one side of a very long table.  Great explanations and suggestions from the servers. They were extremely knowledgeable about all the food, and promptly answered any questions we had about the menu. Even getting down to details about how the food is prepped and cooked. That I really loved.  The apps were great we had the calamari, and crab dip. We ordered 2 of each and they were gone within minutes. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food, out of 12, 1 dish was sent back for being under cooked. I loved my food as did my wife, I had the halibut, which according to our server is one of the most popular on the menu. The halibut was cooked perfectly, served on one of the most delicious crab/potato cakes I have ever had. Wife had the lamb, came cooked perfectly. and was delicious.  One drink was forgotten, but was comped at the end. Overall, everyone left very happy, all of the staff was great, would love to come back and try it without a huge group!",

    "text": "My friend and I went there off peak hours (3:00), nobody was there. Got appetizers it wasn't anything to mention about. We were there for steaks, so here where it all went down hill. Waiter was a moron in the first place. He bought out our steaks and left without our side items we ordered. We both cut into our steaks it was over cooked. I had order a medium rare, it looked more like medium well. Took about 10 mins to even see anybody I even went all around the restaurant. Nobody was there! So he finally came back to check on our steaks which he should have been there for cutting of the steaks in the first place. He said it looks a bit done, so he'll take it back. Moron bought back the same steaks just reheated it and said, the Chef thinks it's about right, maybe it's just the lighting! Are you serious!? Unless you can reverse cook something...what?! I'm baffled!! So we said, it's really dry..and at this point, there is no pink anymore! So he had the chef fired 2 brand new steaks...which we thought it's taking a long time for it. This time the steaks were done the way we want it. You can actually see pink and red center, but I noticed some funny tastes to the side items. I didn't eat much of it. We felt like we had troubled them enough even though it's not our fault. We didn't even touched our order of mushrooms side, I didn't finish most anything on my plate either, yet he didn't bother with asking us if we wanted it to go, not that I would have taken it home anyway. Maybe I should have to use it as evidence that everything had a weird taste to it and have it examined. With all that said after we got home both of us were sick afterwards. Then I figured it had that medicine tastes on the sides...must be laxative or some sort. Can't be a coincidence we both had the same sickness at the same time. NOT GOING THERE AGAIN! FU Dresslers! If it's fatal...I'm sueing.",

We started off with appetizers, which were wonderful as usual.  We both wanted a dish that had risotto for the side, so he ordered the scallops with mushroom risotto and I ordered the salmon with the cherry tomato risotto.  Our dishes were brought out by our very nice waitress Charlene.  My salmon was cold, and the risotto was very under cooked.  My husbands food was hot, but the risotto was the same...very under cooked.  It was incredibly crunchy and not very good.  We asked our waitress if our dishes could be remade.  Everyone has their off nights.  She came out a few minutes later and told us that she had spoken to the chef, and his response was \"The risotto is under cooked tonight, that's the way it is and I can't do anything to change it.\"  I was extremely disappointed.  Dressler's is definitely one of those restaurants that's a treat for us, and it just wasn't very good.  The manager stopped by and did offer to cover one of our cocktails, which was very nice.  Considering the amount of money that we spend to eat at Dressler's, we were expecting a better response than what we received in regards to our food.",

    "text": "Very nice interior which lends itself to a very comfortable dining experience.  Little hesitation at hostess stand while she ended her conversation without even acknowledging our presence but once she hung up, we were seated near window overlooking patio.  I know the restaurant has no control over the plaza and the people that gather there but we watched 20 to 25 runners (?) warm up, stretch, swig water and spit all within our view point.  Was not able to see this until they raised blinds.  Staff might want to wait until runners have left area directly within eyesight before raising blinds.  Ribeye was totally different - chef removes outer fat rim and you are left with what looks like a filet Mignon but once you cut into steak you quickly realize it is not a filet.  Not sure if it was just this piece or this is normal (again have never seen a trimmed ribeye like this) but it was not as tender as a normal cut ribeye.  Flavor was good - blackening spices not over done.  Onion soup is heavenly but you can easily remove the first layer of skin on the roof of your mouth if not careful.  Wines by glass were a very nice selection - still can not fathom why reds are served at \"room temperature\"  which is close to 70 or 72 - they should be cooler.  Spinach salad was adequate - bacon bits were akin to gravel but once pushed out of the way, salad was lightly dressed which is a big plus, not the usual drenching of the greens.  Waiter talked us into dessert because \"Mom\" made it and he was so right.  Best carrot cake ever.  Will be back soon.",

We have had date night, group dinner's, birthday celebrations and new job celebrations here with few and many guests. Dressler's is ON point. My most favorite thing is their CRAB DIP, OMG. I promise, you won't find one better. All lump crab and cheese, no fillers....none.   Here's a rundown of everything I've had. On the dinner menu, appetizers..first let me say this... I ALWAYS get the crab dip, hold the bread and a spoon is perfect lol (seriously). I usually will taste other appetizers from ppl I'm dining with. Appetizers I've tried which have all been good, New Orleans style shrimp, lump crab cake and crab dip. For entrees I've had the following, blackened heart of ribeye (good), filet mignon (medium, good), just for the halibut (good but not a fan of the potato cake as it gets mushy under the fish), lump crab cakes (good but it has fillers and are on the smaller side), rack of lamb (is bomb! very good) shrimp and grits (very good), braised short rib (very good) and the shrimp and lobster linguini (which is no longer on the menu but was very good). Also, you can't go wrong with the mac n cheese and the desserts.  I have to give it to Dressler's bc they have always taken good care of my crew and I & the food is very good.",

I was a little worried we came in too late before the kitchen closed but, they was quick to reassure us. The ambience is dark but, the view is very nice. Try to dine out side if its cool enough. We luckily came here with a Groupon which included two appetizers, a shared salad, two entrees, and a dessert. We rounded out our meal with a couple of drinks, the bf had the pineapple basil cocktail while I had the Melon Mule. Both were strong and complex.   Our meal:  Starters:  Crab cake with pecan remoulade: the crab cake was very hearty and had a nice consistency. The pecan remoulade was too sweet for me, this was on the side and smothered on the mixed greens. I prefer something spicy with my crab cakes.  French Onion Soup: oh the Gruyere! was very filling and had great flavor from all those caramelized onions   Salad:  Cobb Salad: not impressed. The dressing would have been good if it was more on the champagne side than olive oil. But it was very fresh  Entrees (I was full as hell at this point and only nibbled my entree..its ok, midnight munchies) Just for the Halibut: great dish name! but the halibut was a little underseasoned and overcooked. the potato cake was delish and the tomato sauce was also good. A bite with all components together, great!  Pan chicken: True bf loved this fresh! Completed with some roasted potatoes and carrots. The chicken was mostly white with some dark. This however is not reheat/left over friendly. The pan sauce gets really easy after the microwave.   Dessert:  Mom's Apple Cake: wow very good! Props to the mom who created this! Great texture and flavor. Love apple and caramel, this is your deal.   All in all, a great meal! Will be back for more! If you are dining with a groupon, fast! Coming in less than ravaged is a mistake! So much food!",

    "text": "Dressler's was a wonderful experience from start to finish. We didn't utilize valet, but the valet attendant opened the restaurant door for us. I booked on OpenTable, and include it was a birthday celebration. As I approached the hostess, she greeted me before I got to her podium. She immediately mentioned the birthday celebration and said happy birthday to my husband. I requested a certain table option, on my reservation. She walked us to the two table selections she had, for us to select ours. Our waiter, Ryan, aka \"King\" came shortly after we sat down, the first thing he said was \"happy birthday.\" Love his personality. We had the Low Country Crab Dip...delicious! I had the Braised Boneless Beef Short Ribs...tender, juicy...with mash potatoes...Wonderful! My husband had the 26 oz steak. He said it really was like butter and whoever seared the steak knew how to cook steak and did it perfectly. He enjoyed the risotto as well. I made sure to check in to get their free dessert offer. Some of the best cheesecake I've ever had, and the pound cake they gave as a courtesy for his birthday was great! A manager came over to the table to check on us. We have nothing negative to say. The next time we need a good date night, we definitely will be back and will request \"King\" as our waiter. A night well spent!",

The day is as our party arrived not once every got there. Service was great, she checked in us but didn't bother us as we were chatting more than figuring out what we wanted. Great view! I had salmon which was great and perfectly cooked. Brussels didn't look as good at they tasted but were every good. We celebrated a friends 60th birthday and they made us all feel special. I felt like it was a hidden gem.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants in Charlotte's fast-growing Midtown neighborhood, Dressler's boasts great food, friendly service, and an outstanding location overlooking the Sugar Creek Greenway. It's cool, upscale interior is a refreshing oasis from the summer heat, and the incredible views of Uptown make the patio one of the best places to dine when the weather cools down.  The selections on Dressler's lunch and dinner menus range from sandwiches and salads to pasta and fish -- and I can't remember having a disappointing meal. Their Chicken Risotto is excellent, and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich is a reliably terrific choice for lunch. The restaurant also offers a wide selection of local and regional craft beers on tap and in bottles, and there's an extensive wine list and full bar, making Dressler's a great spot to meet friends or colleagues for for an after-hours cocktail.  Whether you drop in for lunch, dinner or a round of drinks, Dressler's at the Metropolitan is worth the visit.",

My husband and I came here for our anniversary and we were immediately greeted with smiles and complimentary champagne. Our waiter \"Asa\" was knowledgable (gave great recommendations), genuine, attentive and friendly. My husband and I both enjoyed different steak meals. Both were generous portions. Our meals came out timely and were cooked perfectly. The views of the city and patio seating are also a bonus. After our meal, we enjoyed some live music out on the patio. Lastly, we were also offered a complimentary dessert for our celebration.  We choose the owner's mothers famous apple bundt cake which was delicious. When we left the restaurant our car was already waiting for us.  We highly recommend and we very pleased with our service and food.",

    "text": "Visited family in Charlotte for the weekend and after our original plans changed, we decided on dinner at Dressler's. I am so glad we made that decision.   Upon arriving, a manager greeted us with a smile and welcomed us. After confirming our reservation, he took us to a table outside in the wonderful weather. He even took into account that the sun would be setting soon and could be right in our eyes, and did we want to sit in the section around the corner. I was blown away by the consideration and customer service. We sat down and were greeted by our server Terry who took great care of us. He brought us the extensive and clearly ever-updating wine list on an iPad. When we questioned a price on a bottle that was unlisted, he was quick to find out for us.  I'm a big fan of broccolini, so once I saw that it was in the gnocchi appetizer, I was sold. We enjoyed the gnocchi while we decided on entrees. When I asked how the best-selling halibut was prepared, Terry was very knowledgeable about every detail. While the halibut sounded tasty, my husband and I both decided on the steak (ribeye for him, 6oz filet for me).  Our steaks were prepared perfectly, as well as our asparagus and potatoes. My filet came with mashed potatoes, and goodness gracious let me tell you those mashed potatoes are ranked in my top 3 mashed potatoes I've ever had. Hubby had the roasted potatoes. I think mine were better. Terry likes the roasted potatoes better. For dessert, I had already decided on the creme brulee even before coming to the restaurant after I saw the menu online. When we sat down I asked Terry if they had it that night and if it looked like they were going to run out to please hold one for me because I was definitely getting it. I took one bite.... and I kid you not, it brought tears to my eyes. I could eat that creme brulee forever. The caramelized topping was perfectly crunchy and not overdone. The custard was perfect. I didn't even eat the strawberry garnish because it didn't need it! Hubby is a chocolate fiend and was surprised to see no chocolate-centered items on the dessert menu that evening (also brought to us on the iPad). He settled for key lime pie, and forgave Dressler's for the lack of chocolate desserts. It was a huge slice!  While we don't live anywhere in the area, I will definitely be making a trip back to Charlotte in the future.... just so I can have more of that amazing creme brulee (also Terry's service was pretty outstanding).",

    "text": "My friends rave about Dressler's and there was finally a groupon for this restaurant.    After only eating a protein bar and subway all day my husband and I were STARVING so we decided to go ahead and use the groupon.  They say hunger is the BEST sauce.  We ordered the Thai Calamari & the Crab Dip.  The calamari was ok.  I was actually really surprised because it had rave reviews on yelp. It was not as crispy as I like for Calamari to be.  The crab dip was really good, we devoured that really quickly.  Our next course was a Caesar salad that we spilt.  The salad was really good.  The homemade croutons were on point and there was the perfect amount of dressing on the salad.  Next up was the New York strip entrees.  LET ME TELLLL YOUUU!!! The absolute best steak I have ever tried.  I mean EVER!  It was soooo good.   The flavoring was perfect.  It was cooked perfect.  We had excellent service.  Our waiter even brought wine samples out to our table to have with our entrees.   The fries were delicious.  My steak and fries were both huge portions.  I could only eat about half of the steak and fries.  My husband on the other hand ate all of his steak and took the rest of mine home.  For dessert we split the Mom's apple pie.  It was ok.  I wouldn't order it again.  The reason for my 4 star review is because I feel like the restaurant is over priced.  I would love to go back and get the steak I had again but I can't justify spending $38 each just on the entree.  The groupon is a good deal though!",

I think he kind of knew without saying anything actually.  We were there with a friend and our lunch was amazing. He treated us with such kindness and took great care of us without being there too often but was there just enough to meet all of our needs.  The food was fantastic.  As an appetizer we had the calamari which I really enjoyed. And I try calamari at every restaurant I go to that serves it.  As an entree I had the fish tacos which I enjoyed very much.  I give this restaurant five stars and we will definitely be back.  Thank you for your excellence and for your staff and again Wade is the waiter to ask for!",

    "text": "One of my top favorite restaurants in Charlotte for sure!   The Dressler's Run Down (According to Nicole from New Orleans):  Appetizers: - Low Country Crab Dip - I'm from New Orleans and I'm hypercritical of any \"Low Country\" seafood dip and this in tremendous! It's creamy, cheesy, and plentiful with real crab.  - Seared Rare Ahi Tuna - if you've never had Ahi Tuna, but are up for it, this is the place to do...especially if you have maybe had Tuna in sushi but never the real deal OR you have a Groupon that typically gives you two appetizers, make this one of them, then thank me later!  - Crab Cakes - very fresh, very lump filled with crab & very tasty, but safe....I'd try one of the other two first if you want to go for it!  Salads:  ***I'd recommend only getting a salad if you have a Groupon or you're a vegetarian and that's going to be a main part of your meal - you get SO much food with your entree! But, the salad to get would hands down be the \"6's House\"   Entrees: - Filet, Ribeye, or the NY Strip are always great choices. I prefer the Filet, then the Strip, then the Ribeye. I've never had a bad cut and it's always juicy, flavorful, and very tender.  - Just for the Halibut is one of my favorites. I love that you get the crab in there with peppers, spinach, and potatoes. It's a great dish I typically get this, the special, or the seared Tuna. I also always split my entree with whoever I'm with and do a beef entree and a fish entree.  - Seared Tuna is an Ahi tuna dish that is light but still so filling at the same time. The Thai peanut slaw and the sesame rice cake are hard to explain, but if you like Asian-fusion food...this is a GREAT choice. It's just a solid winner and anyone I've gotten to taste it has fallen in love and would rather have my dinner than their filet in most cases.  - Rack of Lamb is very nice and tender and the crusted whole grain mustard plus a semi glaze gives a nice, unique flavor you won't find anywhere else. If you are a lamb person, which typically I'm not, this is a great and something you don't see a lot of places either.  - Sauteed Salmon is perfectly cooked every single time and the tomato risotto is a knockout.  - Shrimp & Grits, to me, are just okay. I'm from New Orleans and my standards are REALLY high. There are nothing bold are anything that sets these apart for me that would make me order them or crave Dressler's Shrimp & Grits. They are good, but not \"leave you wanting more\" or authentic tasting.  - I would also suggest staying awesome from (not because they are bad, just because they are \"boring\" so-to-speak), Joyce Farms Chicken, Jumbo Shrimp Linguini, Braised Short Rib, Crab Cakes (they are really good, but all you get is crab cake, no side).  Sides (Ranked favorite to least): 1. Potato Au Gratin 2. Brussel Sprouts w/Bacon 3. Fingerling Potatoes 4. Asparagus / Mac & Cheese 5. Spinach   .......don't order Fries unless it's for children.  Desserts (Ranked favorite to least): 1. Crime Brulee 2. Cheesecake 3. Key Lime Pie 4. Mama's Carrot Cake / Mama's Apple Pie 5. Chocolate Cake 6. Chocolate Mousse Cake  My way of dining there is splitting an app, getting 2 entrees to split, each having a drink, and having a dessert to split. That way we can taste the most stuff. And we usually will do a fish and beef entree or all fish. Their seafood is on point!",

The ambiance is very chic with a very comfortable layout... with a great view of Charlotte's city lights...  2. Service is nice  but out waitress hovered too much... I know there's a fine line between inattentiveness and overly involved but she was definitely in our faces too often. Somebody needs to teach her how to read a customer's nuances... if they are in deep conversation wait a but instead of constantly interrupting... wow... it was annoying.  3. Then... the foods... myeh... the food was served a tad cool and was presented as if it was already prepared earlier that afternoon... the seasoning was totally unimaginative. Basically, the meal was forgettable for the prices...  So, if this was a restaurant with an average location and poor layout then Dressler's would be a no-go, no return. I'll give it another go but the service better be more seasoned and the food better matched for the price.",

    "text": "Went there relatively early on a Friday night.  First impressions: it's a big place, but because the restaurant wraps around the front of the building, it doesn't seem like it when you first come in. Contemporary decor and some really cool booths for big groups. Great view of the Uptown skyline (ask for a window seat if you can)  Service: EXCELLENT! Probably the best I've gotten in Charlotte. The owner (who we not only met but poured our wine) was the general manager for the Morton's in Chicago, and it shows. Everyone from the hostess to our server to the manager were cordial, geniune, and prompt. Little touches like coat check, pro-actively refilling our wine glasses, and discretely clearing were much appreciated! It's also a good sign when the owner takes a personal interest in the customers - we saw Jon spending serious time at tables, talking with people, helping his team.  Food: Very, very good! We went with an all seafood theme tonight. The calamari (with a thai glaze) was awesome stuff, addictive. The crab dip was also very good, with big real chunks of crab. We split the G salad, which was also tasty.  For our meals, my wife had the Mahi Mahi with a lobster sauce - lip-smacking good! I had the shrimp and grits, considered a small plate. It was a FULL size portion of grits with shrimp, crab and a giant diver scallop (also has andouille sausage). Excellent rendition - not as good as Magnolia's in Charleston, but among the best I've had in Charlotte and very generous for the price.  Value: Very good - a lot of good wine choices under $50 per bottle, appetizers in the $10-$12 range, entree's $13-$25  Summary: Big time thumbs up - we'll be back!",

    "text": "First with the issues, the wait staff is young and inexperienced.  I ordered their special steak for $45, was told it came with french fries. I asked if I could have mashed potatoes.  The young women taking my order said no but the fries are home made and are real good.  So I said great sold, medium rare strip steak with fries.  When she left my date said I do not know why you could not have mashed potatoes but ok.  So the meal comes, no fries but mashed potatoes.  I looked confused so the person who was handing me my meal said did we get this wrong?  I shared with her what our waitress had said and she said oh sorry I will bring you fries right away.  I cut into the steak and it was close to well done.  But I was thinking sometimes places cook it more than what you order.  So when I server came to the table I pointed out that their was no red, it was brown right through.  She offered to bring me a new steak...I said that was ok because I do not like to through away food.  I am ok.  The manager came over and saw the steak and said oh, that is well done and you ordered rare...so sorry and once again offered to recook it.  However I once again passed.   He said well I am going to take that off your bill, and I thanked him.  I was pleasantly surprised with the appetizer.  We had the thai calamari with wasabi.  It was unique and quite tasty. That is why I gave it a three star.  I do not think I will be back.  If I want to drop $120 on dinner, Charlotte has better options.",

    "text": "this is more what I expected from Queen's Feast..    a business doesn't need to use the full menu and make it a loss leader, but don't just put your cheapest stuff on it either.  the whole idea behind Queen's Feast is a limited time exceptional value, and this place got it right.  if you are a fan of the Myers Park area, you will feel right at home here.  this place is huge inside, so tables are well spaced.  when first entering, the hostess station is a bit farther back from the door than one would expect.  if empty, you may not even notice it when entering.  hostess was friendly and seated us immediately.  waiter was friendly and attentive for the duration of the evening.  this is one of those places that uses iPads as a drink menu.  my opinion is still split on this business practice.    POSITIVE: as a beer drinker, I like to know my ABV.  my GF likes the additional info that you don't get from a paper wine list.  NEGATIVE: it reminds you that you are most likely dining at a corporation, and it tends to slightly drive up drink prices.  it also detracts from the need for servers to be knowledgeable regarding the drink menu.  food was excellent for the most part.  I ordered my steak RARE, and it was just slightly overcooked.  the quality was good for the price, but not 4-star steakhouse quality.  my only complaint is that size of the calamari appetizer was quite small for $12.  btw, many Queen's Feast restaurants are charging a up-charge for steak.  this place did NOT.  we will definitely return.  like to try the bar area next time",

    "text": "Dressler's is an awesome restaurant. I've been there about 4 times, and it is consistently great food. Their crab cakes are amazing (the pecan remoulade is so unique and fantastic). My husband always gets some sort of steak, and he says it is always cooked to perfection. Last night I had the halibut, and it was amazing as well.  Last night we also ordered their G's House salad. It had the PERFECT amount of dressing, which is so hard to come by. They also put very generous amount of goat cheese and walnuts (along with the other toppings)-- this is especially notable because I feel like many restaurants skimp on the more expensive salad ingredients (like nice cheese and nuts)-- but not Dresslers!   It was our anniversary and they even surprised us with glasses of champagne, on the house. It really made our night.  their menu has something for everyone, but is not overwhelming. great location. overall, wonderful experience.",

FYI, people watching at Birkdale is probably better but the skyline view of the Midtown location is excellent.  Parking is decent.  I believe there is valet at both places in addition to plenty of street and garage parking within a block.    We always get the crab dip appetizer...yummers!  Our entrees I'm a little fuzzy on as it has been a few months.  I know we've done the crabcakes which were great.  And I'm 99% sure I got the filet mignon once and it was great.  Outside of that I can't exactly recall but I know whatever it was we liked it.  One thing I do know for sure is we get the carrot cake for dessert.  Homemade by Mama Dressler we are told and holy crap is it good...and big.  I think we've even gone once or twice just for dessert alone.  We give Dressler's 4.5 carrot cakes out of 5",

    "text": "I can make this very simple and break this review down into a few categories:  Ambiance/Service: Decent.  We were here on a Sunday night so I understand things are slow and everyone is looking to just get home and watch the games they DVR'd.  But, I just wasn't that impressed when we first arrived.  I mean, you just don't get the feel that this is a high-end, special-occassion restaurant.  We stood there by the hostess stand for several minutes without being greeted by anyone.  The bar was right to our left and the bartender appeared to be busy even though her bar was empty.  Eventually, she came over and we realized it was her job to greet and seat--she acted as if we bothered her with our presence.  We didn't like the vibe upon arrival AT all.  We were celebrating a special occasion and I don't fault them for not knowing that but I was for sure rubbed the wrong way--RIGHT away.  Since the prices compare, I was expecting this to be similar to a Sullivan's or Ruth's Chris in terms of atmosphere, service and professionalism...not even close and those are chains!!  We decided not to let mrs empty bar but busy bother us.  Our waiter was very nice and very accommodating.  I wouldn't say he was polished and professional but maybe I was looking for too much.    Food/Wine: The wine selections were plenty and they had 1/2 priced bottles that night!  Nice deal and reasonably priced.  We ordered the garlic and goat cheese appetizer based on the waiter's recommendation...It was..hmmm..let's see....it was good.  I mean, it was goat cheese so how couldn't it be?  I think we were expecting a dip but instead it was a block of goat cheese sitting in olive oil with chunks of garlic surrounding it.  It was served with pita bread so you could spread the garlic and goat cheese over the bread.  It was good but nothing special.  I ordered the grouper and it was divine.  It was buttery, flaky and a nice chunk of fish.  It had a creamy drizzle on top with tasty, juicy and sweet lump crab on top.  It was amazing.  It was served over a potato cake that was fresh and full of flavor.  It truly was incredible.  I HOUSED every bite, left nothing.  Hubby tried the pan seared trout that was served with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  He LOVED it.  The trout was tender, good flavor, fresh, etc.  Everything you would want from a fish dish.  Excellent.  Well done.  We didn't get to try the desserts but we are told they are amazing.    I would return but not for a special occasion.  I don't think they have the service situation locked down yet so I would go with low expectations and just for a regular night out.  I'm curious about their steak and how it compares to other places in Charlotte so may give that a shot.",

    "text": "Just to set the standard for anyone who thinks this place is an upscale 5 star restaurant such as the likes of Del Friscos or Capital Grille ITS NOT.  I was surprised by this place because the websites portrayed itself as such. Although it's far from the likes of a more upscale place the food was actually pretty good.   My main point of issue with this place is service, misleading view of the city, watered down drinks, and decor. First to start things off we got a corner table near the bathroom which was the worse due to the high volume of traffic. The server rushed us through the menu and plopped some quirky iPad POS that didn't contribute to helping our dinning experience almost an afterthought.   When we got our drinks nothing is worse than a watered down too much ice cocktail, nothin more to say here.   The tables and decor were cheap, with many foldable tables visible to accommodate more guests, which was folded down in front of us. To top everything off no one mentioned it was my birthday nor did I get a dessert nor any of the special arrangements made by my girlfriend seems they forgot.   To sum this place up...great food, but needs plenty of direction in overall dining and customer experience. If those aren't any concerns please enjoy this restaurant.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review with the fact that we had 2 Groupons for a table of 8. On the Groupon it says 1 per table. Not 1 per check, but 1 per table.   I made a reservation for our party, which was to celebrate 2 birthdays on Open Table. I called to check on their Groupon policy, and was very rudely told they only take 1 per table \"do you understand?\" click.   Wanting to cancel the reservation I had another person in the party call and speak with a manager, which did allow us to use the 2 Groupons and a note was put in with our reservation.   When we got there at 6 on a Saturday we were immediately seated at a round table with MJ. It was near sunset so the sun was blazing through the windows which they have no blinds for.   We ordered the french onion soup, the salmon with tomato risotto, and the skirt steak medium with green beans, to split between my husband and I because we really couldn't decide between steak or salmon. My husband also ordered a Manhattan.   The soup I thought was very good. Good french onion soup, nothing that made it stand out from others, but very good.   The food came out and the salmon was very good. I thought the risotto was watery, it was sitting in a puddle, which may have been a sauce, who really knows. The salmon had a really good flavor to it, I didn't really enjoy the risotto. My medium flank steak I thought was a little under cooked, but still had good flavor. The green beans were grilled and also very good.   Toward the end of the meal my husband ordered a second Manhattan. We were finished and our plates were cleared by the time he got it. The waiter then said \"here you go\" and spilled it on him, and did not apologize. Weird.   We ordered the peanut butter chocolate cheesecake for dessert, and it was to die for! Get it if you can! Yum!   Overall, the experience was pretty good (good people, good times) but I didn't think the food was worth the cost. If we didn't have a Groupon I would have probably been upset, but maybe MJ was having a bad night, he wasn't around a whole lot.",

I ordered the shrimp and lobster linguini for my entree and it was AMAZING! My fiance had the halibut.. also amazing. The highlight of the night.. the desserts. Made by Mama Joan Dressler.. the apple cake is the best thing you will have ever tasted. This locally owned Charlotte restaurant did not disappoint. Must Try! We will most definitely be back.",

I love goat cheese so serving on a hot plate with oil and garlic..YUM. We both got the center cut rib eye..we weren't 100% on this because we normally eat filet but the server ensured us we would be happy. And we were, they were great! Tender even though I eat med-well..many steak places have a hard time cooking to that and it still being tender and juicy. Dressler's did an awesome job. One of the better steaks I have had in a long time. Had the key lime pie and was very good as well. I can't complain, we had great meals and plan to come back again.",

Divine. The service was absolutely outstanding, was blown away. Matthew is a True professional and really explained us the menu well and made sure our evening was a complete success.

I went there with my husband who didn't like Dressler's but obliged me. I had the chicken with risotto entree which I have ordered a few times before. This time the risotto was runny and the chicken was sitting on top of a runny mess of water. The chicken was overcooked. I hate it when restaurants food quality and quantity are not consistent. The quality of the food declined since the first visit. Won't be going back.",

The greeting and way we were treated was very disappointing. We came in without reservations and were treated like outsiders. Then asked if we were there to use a groupon. Does that matter? No, we were not there to use one. We just randomly decided to dine there. We were there less than an hour and spent about $125. The server was good but just turned off by the managers at the door acting as if we were not up to the standards of their restaurant. I work in an industry and host dinners frequently but I will not be returning here anytime soon.",

    "text": "Dressler's is the kind of restaurant I like going to when I feel like having a very nice and very expensive meal, without having to look as if I'm an investment banker that's just made himself another half-billion dollars on the sale of who knows what, and that's my Mercedes S550 that's parked out front.*   I've come here twice now, and both times, I've been knocked off my feet from how outstanding Dressler's is, both to its commitment to fine dining, and the way the staff treats you like an honored guest. Really, they do. Nothing I hate more than being greeted by a surly or condescending host/hostess that shoots you that smug \"You're Abe Froman? The Sausage King of Chicago?\"** look, while giving you grief over your reservation  - actually, we were 10 minutes late, but they weren't too crowded, so they sat us immediately.  Last night was our second visit to Dressler's. We'd been looking forward to coming back after our first visit, which was wonderful in its own right. To our delight, we were offered a table outside. Let me paint the picture for you: you're facing the greenway off Metropolitan Avenue, you have an unfettered view of uptown Charlotte from where you've been seated - and watching the light show on the Duke Tower is truly wonderful - and you couldn't ask for a nicer August evening, free from oppressive humidity. In other words, the perfect spot for a fantastic meal and some people watching.  We were greeted by our waiter, who identified himself as Johnny Utah***. Seriously. Helpful, attentive, exactly what you want in a waiter.  The wedge salad is a staple in any fine dining establishment, and their Wedgie is no exception. Yeah, it's a wedge salad, but it's a phenomenal wedge salad. I also sampled their grilled sausage, accompanied by some very tasty arugula. Outstanding.  For our main course, my wife opted for the ribeye with a side of steamed spinach. The mark of a quality eating establishment can be narrowed down to a simple question: can you grill a good steak? Of course Dressler's can! When you can cut a steak with a fork, you know they're giving you top-quality meats, grilled by someone who knows how to grill a ribeye. She loves their ribeye; it just might be her favorite in town.  I went for the seared Mahi, accompanied by gnocchi and a light lemon vinaigrette sauce. Perfect, in its preparation, its size, and its presentation. Best yet, I hadn't even been in the mood for Mahi, but if it looks good on the menu, then I know it's going to taste even better.  Finally, yes, what you've heard about Dressler's cheesecakes is absolutely True. Best cheesecake in Charlotte, no question about it. Game over, pal. Dressler's cheesecake is the undisputed heavyweight champion. So good was their featured cheesecake - Oreo Cheesecake! - that my wife called it \"pure, concentrated evil that'll make you lose your load.\" No kidding. I would have ordered a slice of my own, and given myself into such delicious evil.  You really can't ask for a better dining experience, without the pomp and pretense. Dressler's is fine dining without the snooty (SNOOTY?) or snobby (SNOBBY?) atmospherics.****  When a restaurant is better the second time around, you know you've found a keeper. Dressler's is now on my list of Must-Eat Places. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.  * Actually, it was my Mercedes C350. I prefer modesty over extravagance.  ** Ugh. Did I just quote \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off?\"  *** \"Point Break\" just so happened to be on last night. Of course I watched it.  **** Ugh. Did I just quote \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" again?",

We met some friends there who were going to be our witnesses.  They got there slightly ahead of us, and by the time we were there, they had already ordered a bottle of champagne, and were seated in an awesome banquette that looked back towards the city sky line as the sun set, so it was a perfect prelude to dinner. And since I don't drink anymore, they even had a Redbull on ice for me!   The service was really perfect, and our server was hilarious and played along with the whole wedding theme, etc.  He really made the night.    The food more than held it's own.  Too be honest, I only remember what I had, since I was caught up in all the other goings on of the day, but my cowboy rib-eye was cooked perfectly and tasted perfect.  Everyone else cleaned their plates, so I think I'm safe in saying they were thumbs up as well.  We'll be back here again I'm sure, hopefully sooner rather than later.",

It was a really good meal, and although a splurge for us, it was absolutely worth it!  Service I know that other folks have said they weren't greeted when they arrived, but we were very cordially welcomed by three people as soon as we walked in.  Our server was also very attentive and helpful, so we thought the service was quite good.  Dinner We started with the low country crab dip in which we could see and taste BIG chunks of crab meat.  Yummmmmmy!  For dinner, I had the rack of lamb and my husband had the scallop special.  Both of our meals were delicious, but I LOVED my rack of lamb.  It was a very generous portion, with 5 ribs.  That is more than I've ever gotten elsewhere or even served myself at home, so I was thrilled.  It was also a perfectly cooked medium rare as I asked.  My husband's scallops were big and juicy and he had some sort of red bean leek thing that it was served on which he ate completely up.  We also got a side of spinach which was the right amount of garlicky.  For dessert, I got the chocolate cheesecake special (made by the owner!) and my husband got the carrot cake.  We were both quite happy with our choices.    Ambiance We had a fantastic view of the Charlotte skyline which was light up nicely.  I always love the Charlotte night city views so we were very happy about that!  All in all, we thought it was a great place to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Also, the Chandon champagnes are served as splits, so you actually get a glass and a half out of them.  That's a trick we were glad to find out!",

Spaces are too small and you risk life and limb to enter the parking deck.  Anyway, Dressler's is a beautiful space and we were seated and greeted promptly.  Our server was knowledgeable and pleasant.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla which was quite good.  The heat of the chicken was countered by the blue cheese and the rest of the garnishes on the plate.  it was a large serving.  My friends had  good experiences as well.  As I recall, one had a very large grilled chicken salad, another had a grilled chicken sandwich and our fourth had the turkey sandwich.  All very good and fairly large.  Would definitely go back for either lunch or dinner.",

We parked in the garage right across the street (free) and it was a 2 second walk. We're immediately greater when we walked in and were seated.   The menu was amazing and I literally wanted to order 6 things as soon as I saw the menu. Or servers Mitch was super busy but he sent another gentleman to get our drinks which gave us time to look over the rest of the menu. We got two appetizers shrimp and crab dip which were both amazing. She then ordered brazed short ribs and I got Mac & cheese and the halibut which was amazing as well. After an amazing night we topped it off with deserts key lime pie and it was to die for.  Wrapping up the night we had a great conversation with the server Mitch. Very interesting guy, he could be our server any day.  I would recommend you come here for a special occasion or date night!",

    "text": "I happened to be in town with a couple friends, and felt like steak for dinner. Did some research on Yelp, read the menu, and narrowed it down to this one. When we got there, the ambience was elegant. Also, a beautiful view of the patio from where our table was. Upon being seated, our server, Asa, greeted us with such professionalism and a warm personality. I started off by asking for a red wine recommendation, and he suggested a Cabernet Sauvignon by J.Lohr. It was absolutely delicious! We all fell in love with it. Then, we moved on to the dinner menu and each picked an appetizer. Goat Cheese and Roasted Garlic, Sauteed Gnocchi, and Thai Peanut Calamari. I already knew what I wanted for my entree, which was the main reason I picked the restaurant. I chose the Filet Mignon, which is served with asparagus and mashed potatoes. My favorite combo. My friends ordered the Blackened Heart of Ribeye and the Seared Tuna. As the food came out, the taste of each dish was more amazing than the last. I was so overwhelmed with how well done everything was, from presentation to flavor. About halfway through my steak, I decided to ask for the dessert menu. I knew I would have to save some room, but was more than willing to, as everything else was already so impressive!  When Asa returned with the iPad, he not only dropped off the menu, but gave a specific description of each item, and explained the story behind the woman who makes them all. He has such a great character and made us laugh with his stories. Truly an excellent server. We were so convinced at his elaborate descriptions, that we had to pick something sweet. We each chose our own desserts. I got Mom's Warm Apple Cake, and my friends picked the New York Cheesecake and Creme Brulee. When the dessert came out, I knew I made the right choice after the first bite. I was in heaven! And Asa even brought us each a complimentary glass of Lambrusco to compliment the desserts. I was more than satisfied with every course of our meal and didn't want it to end.  The atmosphere was lovely, the food was excellent, and more than anything, our server was probably one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of dining with. I cannot wait to come back to this restaurant. Truly amazing!",

The hostesses were so gracious and warm.  What a nice way to be welcomed into a fine establishment such as this.  We had a Groupon and with that we got the works!  Our server Kennedy was fabulous and patient with us.  She was quick to get rid of our empty dishes and replace whatever needed to be replaced.  I had the tuna as an entree and oh my goodness it was sooooo good.  Per the reviews others left we went with the cheesecake.  We were not disappointed.  Not too sweet or heavy.  It could have used more graham cracker crust because that was so good.  I added an espresso with my dessert and it had to be one of the best I've had in a long time.  We'll be back for sure.  Even without a Groupon.  Might I add all the staff I encountered tonight were pleasant and friendly.  You don't get that much anymore, so I appreciate Dresslers for being above the rest.",

Since we were staying downtown at the Westin, I wanted to make sure if I went too far away, it would have to be worth it.  Dresslers was a great find. We were immediately recognized and seated. Elliot was our waiter and really knew the menu from front to back along with all the specials. He provided some great recommendations, but was also very patient with our slow decisions. We started off with a bottle of Malbec which soon turned into 2 bottles.  We were also very hungry and started with their calamari, cajun shrimp special as well as the crab dip. The starters were enough for 4 people. The crab dip had very nice chunks of premium crabmeat with great flavor. The calamari were not heavily fried while the shrimp were perfectly seasoned.   For the main course, I ordered the scallops while my customers had the lamb as well as the heart of ribeye. Everyone was quite impressed with the quality and flavor of the food as well as the service. I suppose that Monday isn't their busy day as there weren't many others dining except for several who opted to be outside on the deck.  Their slogan is Eat Well, Laugh Often, Live Long.",

The night we went, the kitchen staff was quite busy with prom night dates. Yet, the kitchen never missed a beat!  We were happy to see the owner or manager making the rounds at each table. That is a nice, personal touch.  The steaks here are amazing. Very juicy. Certainly did not disappoint! Service is prompt and polite. Our server was \"Beth\", and she was a delight. Parking is simple, just across the street at the garage.  Only down side, people don't dress up anymore to go out to a nice place. If you come in a tie or dress, you might be overdressed :)  Great location!",

    "text": "I was expecting more from this experience and it was just , meh. We had dinner reservations before going to see Hamilton and we wanted a to make it a really great night. First, handing me an iPad with your cocktail and wine list is just so impersonal to me and so Olive Garden-ish. So that was a big fat negative at the get go. What happened to educating the wait staff on your signature libations and wine pairings? Apparently a lost art. We ordered the Goat cheese and Garlic appetizer to start. It was pretty much an entire cheese log floating in a ton of olive oil and with three slices of garlic. I'm still not sure what it was trying to achieve. The table next to us later ordered the same dish and theirs look entirely different.  For our entires, I ordered the shrimp and grits - The grits were very lumpy and grainy and really thick. The shrimp were in my opinion, over cooked and rubbery. The dish was drowned in a beurre blanc that the lumpy grits soaked up. I basically ate the shrimp and left the grits. Disappointing for sure. My husband had the K.C strip and subbed out the fries with fingerling potato's . The server asked my husband to slice down the middle to see if it was cooked to his liking. He would if he could but the restaurant uses those horrible Laguiole knives!! Worst.knives,ever! The steak should be the star but it was covered in a garlic butter that was just overpowering while the fingerlings were a crusty burnt clump. My husband did check in with YELP and we received a free dessert. We shared the pumpkin cheese cake and it was delicious. I had such high hopes for the establishment- the rating is for the view bc it is a spectacular one of the city skyline. Spending $200 on a mediocre at best meal is disappointing- I should have stuck with Sullivan's as we have never been disappointed there. If you are looking for a good food experience, keep yelping. Nothing to miss here",

    "text": "Wowza. I can't believe it's taken me 3 years in Charlotte to make it to this place. From the minute I looked at their menu online, I was drooling over the food. Finally made it last night, to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my wife.  Upon being seated, we were greeted by the manager with two glasses of champaign (on the house) to welcome us on our anniversary. The two servers who were taking care of us were extremely knowledgeable and detailed in their reviews and explanations of menu items. (William, you're awesome).   Appetizers: Thai Peanut Calamari & Low Country Crab Dip - The Calamari was cut into large 'steaks', unlike most places with traditional rings. These were very meaty, cooked to perfection, and the thai peanut sauce blended perfectly with the slight tang of the wasabi aioli. The crab dip was probably the best I've had at a restaurant - full of large lump pieces of crab and covered in cheese. A stand out dish for sure.  Salad: G's House - The goat cheese was paired well with the house made balsamic vinaigrette in this. I'm usually not a big goat cheese fan, but this salad really worked.   Entrees: 9oz Filet Mignon & Just for the Halibut - the filet was cooked exactly as ordered, and covered in a delicious mushroom demi glaze. The mashed potatoes had a delicious flavor that was perfect with the demi. While a filet is always good, it really couldn't stand up against how phenomenal the Halibut dish was. There were so many distinct flavors that all paired perfectly together. The sun dried tomato sauce was amazing with the chive potato cake, as well as with one big bite of halibut & crab. It'll be hard to order anything different next time I go, that's how good it is.   Dessert: Mom's Carrot Cake & Mom's Apple Cake - The apple cake was good, if not a little bit too try in my opinion. I wouldn't be in a rush to order again. I know many other reviews rave about it, so I may have had a one-off experience with it. Mom's Carrot Cake, however, was incredible. Moist & covered in a cream cheese frosting, exactly the way it should be.   TL;DR: Get the calamari appetizer & the Just for the Halibut entree. You literally cannot go wrong here.",

    "text": "Our first time here.  It took us five years to get around to it with another couple who highly recommended it.  I have been disappointed with Frescos and some other supposedly wonderful steak houses; but reluctantly agreed to give Dressler's a shot.  Hardest part was finding the restaurant tucked away east of Uptown.  With going home traffic we made a lot of turns and there it was.  Fortunately it has a responsive valet and that was a relief.    Dressler's has indoor and outside eating areas.  The outside was tempting as it has an very nice city view, but why sweat while eating unless you have to?  We went inside.  Our 6pm reservation made us early birds as there were only a couple of tables outside and only one other one indoors.  My negative suspicions were kicking in.  Seated, our server went through the routine and it turned out that he was just super.  For some reason my receipts say \"Tiffany\" but Tiffany was a guy.  Turns out it was Mathew.  I would ask for him next time.  Menu was straight forward.  It is a meat place, so since we wanted steak we were ready to go.  We had cocktails and the bar did an excellent job.  Wines by the glass were available so everyone was happy.  Went for appetizers, onion soup, calamari and Cajun shrimp.  The onion soup was judged by the ladies as so-so, but the calamari and shrimp were great.  Calamari were in extruded solid tube shapes.  Not seen before and questionable, but they were delicious.  My guy friends and I wolfed those down and then went for the Cajun shrimp.  The shrimp were in a chafing dish, hot and sitting in a very flavorful and rich sauce.  It was simply not just Cajun seasoning, but something more light and sophisticated.  With a small loaf of french bread it was a high point.  I could go for a this as a dinner option it was so good.  We ordered one unnecessary chopped salad, which all of us sampled.  It was just fine, but after the appetizers, we were questioning whether we had room for the Filet Mignons we all had ordered.  The meat came.  I was astounded that they were cooked exactly perfect.  Is that redundant? My medium had the by-definition warm red rare center and the tender meat around it was light pink to the slightly crisp edges of the meat.  Rare appeared to be wiggling across from me, but by then the Manhattans I was sipping were kicking in.  Mashed potatoes, just like mom's at home, were delicious and it was a good mound of delight to take in.  Asparagus was the veggie and there were other choices as far as good-for-you stuff goes.  The only down side was that the dime-glaze on the meat, and the mom's potatoes were very salty.  I wiped off as much of the glaze as I could to realize with excellent cut of meat, but I could only get through about one-third of the potatoes.  All of us at the table had the same judgement.  We told Mathew and the manager, not as a complaint, but just so they could be watchful for the heavy-shaking kitchen crew lurking in the background.  No, we did not want a complementary or reduced bill, just hope that no one else gets the same.  Just in-case, I recommend that you ask for the dime-glaze on the side.  The dinner was a 2.5 hour experience which was really a pleasure.  Good job Dressler's.  You can count on another visit from us.  When we exited, our car was parked immediately across the street from the front door and that was a True topper for an evening of great service, food and continual checking by management.  I will note that both dining areas were filled within an hour of our arrival and it was principally that evening full of business men.  Hot summer night and guys in coats and ties = business guys.  And it was not noisy.  We could talk at our table.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a great restaurant in Charlotte, do be sure to visit Dressler's for dinner....and if you're lucky enough to have Clark K. as your waiter, then you'll dub him Superman as we did!  My hubby and I (from NYC) were visiting my best friend and her hubby and celebrating her birthday...so expectations were high.    We dine out in NY almost 3x/week and have had varied experiences, some frustrating and some amazing,  and we wrongly thought that Dressler's could even compete.  We willingly gave it a try on Saturday night and were thoroughly impressed.  I will state without reservation that the food was wonderfully presented and quite delicious; but for me, the make or break for any restaurant is its front-line staff ,which is equally as important as the chef's skill.  I tend to regard the waitperson's role as ambassador for the restaurant.  Clark is the consummate professional -- he was friendly, showed great attention to the details, big and small, and offered us superior service.  One key thing was that he didn't badger us with information the moment we sat down, he allowed us the time to enjoy our cocktails and our friends.  He read our table perfectly and approached at the right time throughout the entire evening.  How many times have waiters/waitresses rudely interrupted your conversation with specials or to ask if you're enjoying your meal, while you are trying to chew or rushing you out because they are at the end of their shift?  Clark, not only did not employ any of the above but he shared his wonderful personality with each of us individually and as a group.  I've never felt better attended to or respected as a diner as I did with him.  Our simple Wedgie Salads were fresh, nicely presented and tasty.  The Thai calamari was a great twist on an old favorite.  Our entrees which included flounder, seared tuna and two types of steak were enjoyed and consumed happily.  We will definitely return to Dressler's when we visit again and will keep our fingers crossed for another wonderful experience with our Superman!",

The beer I ordered was out, but no biggie, I just picked a different one. The G's House Salad was DELICIOUS. I don't normally get too excited about salad, but this one was good. Am I seriously raving about a salad?  Anyway...  I ordered the scallops special. I'll be honest, it was a little salty for me. Tasty, but salty. It comes with a ham hock reduction (thus the salt) and a bit of lobster. I was torn between this and the halibut, which I hope to try sometime.  Can I rave about the coffee for a minute? I'm hardly a coffee snob -- I couldn't tell you what makes a coffee \"good\" -- but their coffee was WONDERFUL. It was honestly the best part of the meal, and that's not a knock on the food. It was just...GOOD COFFEE.  I was too full for dessert, but there were some appealing choices. Maybe I'll stop in sometime for that peanut butter cheesecake. Something tells me it'd be worth it.",

My fiance likes to get the ribeye or braised short ribs and loves both - I prefer the crab cakes which are delish and ask for extra pecan remoulade - you won't regret it.  And the dessert...oh the desserts - hand made by the mother of the owner and her daily cheesecake flavor is always a good choice.

We started off with the Low Country Crab dip which was AWESOME!! We gobbled up every single bite! For dinner I ordered the Blackened Heart of Ribeye. It was cooked to perfection! Ate every last bite!! My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp and Lobster Linguini. I sneaked a bite and it was delish! We finished the night off with a generous slice of carrot cake. Pure heaven!

We were pleasantly surprised that there was a band playing. For a starter we had the goat cheese and tomato chutney.  I had the scallops and shrimp and grits any my husband had the duck. Both were delicious. We finished up with the key lime pie and peanut butter chocolate cheesecake. No complaints there! The staff was very attentive and pleasant. I wanted the night to be at a slower pace. We weren't rushed, but I had to ask for our server not to bring things out too quickly. No sooner did we get our appetizer than our entrees showed up. I wanted a more leisurely dinner experience.  If you are looking for a budget dinner date, this is not the place (but we expected that). 1 app, 2 glasses of wine, 1 drink, dinner and dessert ran us around $120.",

    "text": "My family and I went 07-21-15 restaurant week. Before I get into the food I would briefly like to write about the menu pricing and service. Upon arrival, the manager looked at my family and I as if we were lost then ask us if we had reservations. No major red flag but not the greatest welcoming. Atmosphere was pleasant with a great view of charlotte skyline. Menu was placed on top of the setup plate and came in contact with our silverware. Menus are full of bacteria and germs since many customers pick them up to read them. The queens feast menu was overpriced by $5 ($35 total) since standard menu prices for appetizer, entree, and dessert would have been around $40 depending on what you get. Typically a $30 fixed price menu would cover standard entree off full menu and appetizer and dessert would be considered free, depending on how you look at menu prices. My wife and daughter ordered filet mignon, NOT on the queens feast menu for $34. I decided to order off the queens feast menu and had the calamari, blackened heart of ribeye and key lime pie for dessert. Calamari was just okay but has a spicy wasabi sauce that I did not like. Our entrees came and looked charred. Granted, my ribeye was blackened but my wife and daughters filet were also slightly charred. Not only did they look charred but also tasted charred. I could not eat the ribeye and requested the same cut not blackened. Upon receiving the new ribeye the results were similar to my daughters filet, slightly charred. It did not taste terrible but I feel was still unacceptable. My daughter was not able to finish her filet. Asparagus was good, no problems there. The mashed potatoes were extremely lumpy and my wife's mashed had a lump so big it looked like a plain cooked potato that was poorly attempted to be considered mashed. The only successful part of the course was the dessert. The key lime pie was probably the BEST KEY LIME PIE I have ever had in my life. I wish I ordered one to go. Waitress said the key lime pie is even better at the Huntersville location. Unfortunately I would only go back to Dresslers for dessert. Quality control needs to be enforced and the grill may need to be cleaned or the heat turned down a little.",

The four of us created our own \"surf & turf\" by ordering two of the \"Just for the Halibut\" entrees and two beef entrees. (One filet, one bone-in ribeye.)

    "text": "\"If I got nothing good to say, then say nothing at all\"   Hmm... in that case most of my reviews will be pretty blank lol.  So, here're something good: warm decor; good view by the windows (thank you to Duke Energy building, since it makes up majority of that view).    I have been to the Birkdale location before.  I remember I almost melted by their crabcakes.  My first visit to the Met location, and I can't say the same about the food.  The french onion soup and the wedge salad were both solid, but they are hardly difficult to master.  I had the halibut, which came highly recommended.  The fish was bland, a little bit overcooked maybe, but definitely bland.  The potato cake at the bottom was flavorful though.  The ribeye was... tricky.  We seriously had to do a double take to make sure it wasn't a filet.  It was in a shape of a filet... cut into it and it was lean like a filet.  Turns out that's what they called \"the HEART of ribeye.\"  I don't know about anyone else, but I say that's kinda silly.  If I want a lean cut of small portion steak, I would have ordered a filet.  People who love ribeye normally like the fatty part for the juicy flavor factor along with the size of a normal ribeye entree.  We felt cheated that part of the ribeye experience.  And in part it's our fault for not reading the menu carefully.  I spoke with another server I met after this dinner, and he said he always \"warns\" people about that, obviously we're not the only one who misunderstood this dish.  The service was subpar.  They didn't even bring a steak knife, which I assume is bare minimum of a service where they charge $30 for a steak.  Don't get me wrong, the server was nice, but again it's all about expectations.  For fine dining, we were expecting more... and we're slightly disappointed.",

The two bartenders that we've had the pleasure of being served by are Brian & Rowena.  They are on top of everything.  Extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable...so good at what they do.  Brian seems to be a masterful bartender... (not knocking Rowena in any way) One evening we went in and he had...on his own... before work, bought rhubarb at the Kings Rd. Farmers Market.  While we were there he was chopping it up & sent it back to the kitchen for them to reduce it to a simple syrup.  He generously made us a drink with this super-tasty syrup and a bit of aperol & something else.  It was soooo good!  A bright, refreshing, summer cocktail!  The appetizers (1/2 price in the early evening) are soooo good.  The calamari is lightly battered and lightly fried, but it's long tenders of the calamari. (so if you don't like the little, crunchy octopus babies - no worries)  The Thai Chili Shrimp is good and the Crab Dip is so full of large chunks -omg- more, please.  So - all in all - I think we'll be skipping the dining room & stay at the bar with Brian & Rowena!",

As it is Restaurant Week, the hubby and I decided we would give the place a try for dinner.  Appetizers during the meet and greet were excellent!  The New Orleans Style Shrimp, Baked Pimento Cheese (with tomato jam!) simply delish!  After making our rounds, we sat down to dinner.  Can I just say the service was excellent!!! Our server, Brian was friendly and very attentive. We even were visited by Jon the owner, who gave me a great wine suggestion (Sokol Blosser \"Evolution), which turned out to be the perfect compliment to my salmon.  We started with the Shrimp (which hubby should have tried at the meet and greet).  It was seasoned to perfection, with just the right amount of heat and served with crusty baguette slices (my weakness).    As it was Restaurant Week we ordered for the Prix fix menu: We both had the Wedge Salad.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp, bleu cheese dressing nice and creamy.  I had to make myself stop eating it to have room for my main course.  I followed this with the Salmon, which was served with tomato risotto. Hubby ordered the crab cake.  My Salmon was cooked perfectly, the risotto very flavorful.  Hubby liked the crab, but wasn't crazy about the pecans in the remoulade.  I was stuffed after eating half my entree, so we got our dessert to go.    This was a great dining experience, from the ambience, to the food, and  excellent service.  We will have to revisit soon.",

It was the perfect refreshment to celebrate the return of warm weather. The calamari we ordered was the best calamari I have ever had. Instead of the small over cooked and greasy ringlets most restaurants serve the calamari at Dressler's is cut into long juicy strips and is topped with a glorious peanut sauce that has wasabi drizzled without. We also sampled the crab cake, which was good but paled in comparison to the calamari.  After a brief interlude with a split wedge salad (a salad came with the deal) we got to taste our entrees. My filet was done perfectly and the cut was one of the more tender steaks I have had. The asparagus were lightly seasoned over creamy mashed potatoes. The only flaw was the sauce on the filet was a little too sweet and I think it would have been better done if the cut of the steak was more lightly seasoned to show off the natural deliciousness of a filet. We ended with the cheesecake which had an enviable lightness, though neither of us cared for the cinnamon sprinkled on top.  The waiter was very friendly and kept our drinks full. We will definitely be back to sample more of the menu!",

I've eaten there around 15-20 times in the past 3 years and have never had a bad meal.  The servers are always very friendly; you can tell they're not just doing a job but actually enjoy working there.  Nearly every time I have been there, Mr. Dressler himself has been present, going from table to table personally to make sure everything is satisfactory.  The food itself is spot-on every time and portions are generous; and they save the best for last with some of the best desserts in town.  \"Mom's cheesecake\" is the best I've had in this city; it gives a run for the money for even the best cheesecakes in NYC.  The view is quite good with plenty of outdoor seating when weather is nice, and the indoor seating is very elegant without being stuffy and pretentious like some other 4-dollar-sign restaurants are.  The occasional Groupons that they offer ensure that I come in much more often that I would otherwise be able to afford, and I've never been treated as a 2nd-class customer just because I have a coupon.  To the contrary, the staff congratulates us on the good deal we're getting, which is certainly True.",

Like a lot of people, I fall into restaurant ruts, but that is not the case with Dressler's. So, why the multiple visits?   To start, the view is great, especially if you happen to dine on a warm evening and can eat outside. Lots of great people watching from that vantage! The decor inside is sophisticated enough to impress a client or for a celebration, but casual enough to have a nice meal without a lot of fuss. On my several visits here, the food has been consistently good from appetizers through dessert. I have to say, I am partial to the pork chop or the ribeye steak. I want to note as well the expansive gluten-free menu with a range of options beyond salads like a lot of other restaurants.   I also want to second how seamless event planning is here. Rhonda was a pleasure to work with, and the wait staff were so accommodating. I work for a state agency, so we can't expense alcohol, but the bar staff was still able to create a custom \"mocktail\" so that we could toast our retiring staff member. Great, right?",

We had a 7:00 reservation, and when we got there, we took advantage of the complimentary dinner valet parking and we were seated right away. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice!! Our server, Asa was absolutely amazing!! He was super friendly and gave us a lot of knowledge of the menu items. I thought the iPad with listings of cocktails, wines, and desserts was a very modern touch!! I ordered the peach martini and it was really good. We got the lump crab dip appetizer on the house, and it was delicious. I ordered the just for the halibut and the Mac and cheese side and my date ordered the sauteed salmon with the tomato risotto. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the risotto was delicious. My just for the halibut was very interesting, and different, and the mac and cheese was excellent as well. We took advantage of the free dessert offer when you check into Yelp and ordered the Mom's Apple cake and OMG!! It reminded me of my great granny's Apple cake! Real Apple slices baked into the cake, it was SO good!! Dressler's was absolutely amazing and we definitely left with an experience. We will be back for sure!!",

    "text": "WOW. The philosophy at Dressler's Restaurants is simple: Everyone who walks through our doors is either already a friend, or will be. Our entire experience embraced that.   Fantastic meal with even better service. My friend and I went for a Treat Yourself Thursday dinner. Dressler's is located in the Met. Complimentary valet will park your car or you can park it yourself in the garage.   The interior had a swanky and classy but not over the top feel. The entire menu looked fantastic. Our server made fantastic food recommendations so we decided to order them. In True Treat Yo'self form, we decided that wine was on the docket. They have an iPad which serves as their wine, beer, cocktail, dessert menu. We decided to trust it to the pros and told the manager/wine-guy our budget and food choices and let him go from there. He really delivered!   The calamari was great. Instead of rings and tentacles, they used calamari steaks that were cut into strips, soaked in buttermilk, lightly battered and fried. They served it tossed in a Thai peanut sauce with wasabi drizzle. A completely different but amazing calamari experience.   For entrees, we chose the Just for the Halibut and Heart of Ribeye. Both fantastic choices. It was a great surf-and-turf combo. This is one of those places were you shouldn't skip dessert. The cheesecake was killer. Not dense and overly sweet like some places, but light and almost refreshing.   Overall, it was a pricey but totally worth it meal. I would recommend it for special occasions or just when you feel fancy.   Thanks for a wonderful evening, Dressler's. I'm looking forward to returning soon.",

Our ribeyes were perfectly cooked to order, the service was attentive and very pleasant, and the valet service was courteous and a welcome way to avoid having to hunt for a parking space on our own!  Overall a very nice experience, and we will happily return to try more of the items in their regular menu.",

    "text": "I went here for my birthday dinner on Sunday- my boyfriend picked out the restaurant and said he was looking for something similar to Ruth's Chris/Capital Grille but wanted to try somewhere we haven't been.   We were served by the sommelier, which was perfect since it was a special occasion and half-price wine bottles (every Sunday). She recommended a French red wine that went well with our meal.  To start, we ordered French Onion soup which was good but way too salty- I couldn't finish it. I ordered the filet, and they were very accommodating about my mushroom aversion- the demi glace on the filet normally comes with mushrooms but I was able to get a non-mushroom version. The filet was cooked perfectly but, again, the demi glace was extremely salty. I also couldn't finish this dish, which was unfortunate considering how expensive it was. My boyfriend got the strip steak and it was a little under cooked and also very salty. The fries that came with it were really good though.  We decided to get a slice of homemade cheesecake for dessert even though all the salt and food had filled us up already. Finally we were served something not too salty! The cheesecake was delicious and easily my favorite part of the meal. I also ordered a cappuccino which was average.   Overall, I want to point out that there are 3 things keeping us from coming back in the future:  1. Over-salted dishes- this is a shame because the actual food itself was very good.  2. Slow service- Our reservation was at 7:30pm and we left at 9:30pm. This would be fine, except we continually waited around with empty plates and water glasses before anyone noticed. It was also Sunday night, so we weren't trying to have a long, leisurely dinner that would be normal on a Friday or Saturday. The place was pretty empty (maybe 5 other tables were full) so I don't know why the service was so slow.  3. No birthday acknowledgement- My boyfriend told them it was my birthday two times: once when he made the reservation and once when the hostess seated us and asked if it was a special occasion. I wasn't expecting a free dessert or anything outrageous, but a \"Happy Birthday\" from our server or a candle in the cheesecake would have been nice.  If/when those 3 things are fixed, I would say Dresslers could definitely compete with the other high end steakhouses in the area. Until then, I will be making reservations elsewhere.",

    "text": "We also got the Groupon and used it for an anniversary dinner.  Bottom line is we will be back and gladly eat at full price.    The service was some of the best I've experienced.  Our server, Jerry, really put the effort forward to make sure our wine glasses were full, our table was cleared of empty plates, new silverware came with every course...and it was all done with a genuine smile.  Kudos because there are a lot of places that have let customer service slip through the cracks.  Dressler's is an example that all restaurants should follow.  Now, the food.  We started with the thai calamari and the crabcake appetizers.  The crabcake was good, nothing crazy but the toasted pecan roumelade was wjhat made the dish.  The calamari was really really good.  A really good balance between the peanut sauce and the spiciness of the wasabi.  We were very pleased with this course.  We shared the chopped salad, and it was good.  The bacon was fresh, the dressing had a nice bright flavor...all in all it was solid.  The entrees...I had the rack of lamb and she had the shrimp and lobster linguini.  First off, the portions were HUGE.  The rack of lamb had 4 bones of lamb resting around a heaping serving of mashed potatoes, drizzled with a demi glace that really tied the plate together.  The lamb was cooked perfectly as well.  The pasta was really great as well.  The servings of shrimp and lobster were generous, the pasta was fresh, and the parmesan cream was the perfect sauce for the dish.  We had to have some food boxed up in order to save room for our dessert.  For dessert we split the NY Cheesecake which was also really good.  The consistency was almost like a whipped cream cheeses...very light and fluffy compared to the traditional dense NY style.  The crust was great too...a perfect dessert to finish the evening.  Spend some time on the wine list...there are some hidden gems in there for some extremely reasonable prices.",

Multiple times we were left without having any beverage, water nor alcohol. Our waiter was too worried about the couples around us, and did not check in on us. The salad was nothing to write home about and for almost a $200 meal, we should not have felt like an inconvenience for the waiter.",

We had a groupon for a 4 course meal and weren't given any attitude or looked down upon for having the discount. The appetizers were lovely. Shrimp for the wife and tuna for me. We scraped the plates. We shared a salad and my entree, the braised short rib was great. My wife felt her filet mignon was salty and I agreed after taking half. Not A deal breaker though.

So this restaurant is nice- it's more expensive, but when we compare pricing to what we get at other steak houses in Charlotte, the food was much better all around, when considering apps, salad, entree and dessert! While another place may have\"the best\" of one of those items, everything was on point at dresslers including the service of every single person we came into contact with. Ambiance is nice; great location... We were really impressed with everything!  Being Charlotte natives, we've been missing out!   I recommend the pimento cheese dip, kc strip, and carrot cake! Ill try new things next time for the experience, but it will be hard not to go back to those!  My husband went with crab cakes- again amazing... Impressive for a restaurant to have it all going on!!   Great for a special occasion- or making a normal Tuesday something to talk about!",

The piece did have the bone and some fat that couldn't be eaten but the steak was just so good it was enough.  Would have preferred something else to the fries it came with but was still good. We also ordered a side of the bacon brussel sprouts. I thought they would be more in tact but they were shredded. Very full of bacon flavor. Yum!

    "text": "Dressler's metropolitan location is a smaller version of the one up north and conveniently located in the Prime shopping area with plenty of parking at the garage or you were optional valet parking out front  We were greeted almost immediately by the bartender who welcomed us to set and we did. She was very fast and efficient and had to make a wide variety of drinks while we sat and watched. She really knew what she was doing  Something that's never happened to me before is the manager came out and said we had an extra appetizer out of the kitchen can I offer it to you which I thought was a really nice touch  We proceeded to have dinner with a few entrees centered around salmon And another signature fish - both of which were very good  We also both enjoy dessert the chocolate mousse cake and an apple tart that we're just the right size and apparently made fresh every day by the owner's mother  Appetizers and salads were typically priced In the six to $10 range wall entrees were mid 20s to mid 30s each  Overall I would highly recommend this location for a more elegant evening out And priced at about $100 each",

Unfortunately for tonight I received deplorable customer service  by a shorter individual named Max  D who had a severe temper. He not only nearly threw a temper tantrum in the restaurant, he reeked of marijuana. Already in a bad mood, he insisted I needed a salad based off of my appearance. I ordered the self proclaimed house salad, which was horrendous. The dressing was way too salty and void of any other flavor and was oddly greasy. The bread served was stale, and the butter tasted more like cheap margarine. After this, I left the restaurant feeling alienated I overheard the shorter teenager commenting on my weight and how I didn't eat my salad. I will never return to Dressler's and anyone who reads this review does the same",

The menu is a good mix of steaks and seafood. The sides are a little southern comfort and trendy bites made to perfection. The crab dip alone will make me drive form the SC border to midtown (no sharing next time) along with the well poured cocktails.   The Waite staff was attentive and quick to accommodate.

    "text": "Had really high hopes for Dressler's after reading many of the reviews, but left there very underwhelmed. Maybe because its Restaurant Week and they're overwhelmed, but from the looks of the fairly empty dining room its probably something else.  On the good side the interior is very upscale and attractive with great views of uptown. It was downhill from there. First, my wife noticed that the background music was all Motown from the 60's, not bad music, but something I'd expect to hear in a diner, not a restaurant with white table cloths. How about some light jazz? Second, we all went with the selections from the restaurant week list as we were told it was the same portions and quality as the regular menu. I hope this isn't the case. For starters, we went with the calamari, which got so many raves from others, goat cheese and a lettuce wedge. The calamari came out smothered in the Thai chili sauce without the wasabi aoli. Our serving looked nothing like the pictures here on Yelp. The goat cheese and the lettuce were OK, but definitely not special.  Entrees were the Maryland crab cakes and two orders of salmon with grape tomato risotto. My wife ordered the crab cakes and being from Maryland, is very particular. Unfortunately these were OK, but nothing special, way too much breading to be authentic. She's had much better at Capital Grill uptown. Although the mixed greens salad that came with it she said was very good.  My daughter and I each had the salmon. Our opinions were very mixed. I thought the salmon was quite good, crispy on one side, but very moist and tasty through out. Her serving of salmon was over cooked and dried out. In both cases our waiter neglected to ask how we wanted our salmon cooked, so I guess I was lucky. While I liked my salmon it was served on top of what looked to be a liquidy concoction of buerre blanc and risotto. There was so much butter sauce it was inedible, thankfully the salmon was on top.  Desserts were a mixed bag as well. We had the apple crisp, cheese cake and carrot cake. The apple crisp won out as the best. The carrot cake was very moist and the cream cheese frosting was rather tasty, but I couldn't find any trace of carrot. Dead last was the cheese cake, it was bland and not very creamy as we had expected it to be.  Finally, this was supposed to be a birthday dinner for my wife and myself as we were born only a week apart. I made the reservation through Open Table and made sure to add this was a special birthday dinner under the special requests section. Unlike other yelper's experience there was absolutely no acknowledgment of our event either from the hostess or our waiter. I thought well at least we'll get a candle. Nope, nothing. Generally our waiter was less than friendly, I guess he was just to exhausted from all the other revelers out for Restaurant Week by the time we showed up.",

I made reservations on Open Table and mentioned that it was our anniversary and we'd like a view of the CLT skyline.  The hostess was fantastic - we were running late due to some other travel arrangements and we called to give them the heads up and they were very accommodating.  When we arrived and told them our name they immediately wished us Happy Anniversary and sat us at a booth with the most amazing skyline view.    Our waiter was wonderful, and when I asked for vegetarian recommendations he produced an entire vegetarian and gluten free menu which totally caught me by surprise!  We ordered the pimento cheese appetizer and it was awesome, but that goat cheese looked very tempting as well.  The Hubs ordered the seafood and grits entree and I got linguine with a garlic cream sauce from the veggie menu.  Everything was wonderful and the service was spot on.  For dessert we had one of Mama Dressler's homemade cheesecakes and it was just melt in your mouth amazing.

Experience - call ahead reservations.  mentioned wifes birthday and asked if they could set the table accordingly Arrived to a table set with fresh cut flowers a bottle of bubbly and 2 champagne glasses.  We aren't drinkers but it was a nice gesture and added a nice touch. Host and waiter stopped by to wish my wife a happy birthday  Dinner-  Me: Started with G's House.   A little tangy for me but I have never been a fan of vinaigrette dressing.  The sweetened walnuts was a nice touch.  They were crispy on the outside and a little chewy on the inside which caught me off guard at first but were very tasty.  Entree was Heart of Ribeye with blue cheese butter, fingerling potatoes and asparagus.  Steak cooked perfectly at a medium.  Well seasoned and charred slightly on the outside to sear in the flavor.  No fat at all.  I think the chef takes a 14 oz ribeye and just removes the heart of the steak.  I finished off dinner with Creme brulee.  The custard was very smooth.   Dinner- Wife:  My wife had the G's house salad and loved it.  She followed up with the rack of lamb which was very tender.  As a birthday treat, the creme brulee for my wife was topped with a lit candle and was on the house.    The service by all was exceptional.  Always greeted with smiles.  The waiter (Chris) was very knowledgeable of the menu and explained all menu items that we had questions about without a stutter or hiccup.  Ambiance is great for a romantic dinner as the tables are candlelit with great view of the cityscape looking up 4th street.  The restraunt was very quiet and everyone seemed to be enjoying their experience.    Negatives: I wish I had found this place sooner.  Jon Dressler has a great thing going.  I would give this place a 5 but I have only eaten here once so I will save the 5 star rating for my second visit.",

We started with the calamari which I saw many rave reviews about online. It was definitely not my favorite. Very different with a wasabi sauce and a light fry, but I've definitely had better. We both had stead for dinner. The potatoes were good, but the steak was not. For the price I was expecting way better but what I got was equal to one from Outback Steakhouse. It was way overdone (I asked for medium and it was definitely medium well to well done). And it didn't seem like high quality meat. For dessert we had the chocolate cake. It was an ok cake, but the chocolate sauce was sour for some reason, and I didn't see anything about raspberry or anything in the description.  As for the service, our waitress was nothing exceptional like it should be for a restaurant of this caliber. We are a young couple, and it seemed like she didn't want to give us too much attention because we obviously weren't going to buy the most expensive bottle of wine. Didn't offer us straws when she did for the table right next to us, nor lemons for our water. The bread came after we were completely done with our appetizer. It just didn't feel elegant. I do wish it was better but it wasn't worth it! We will not be going back.",

Let me start off my stating this use to be my go to place for professional and personal reasons. I frequent this establishment with my co- workers, family and out of town guest very often. However my experience on Wednesday  has left a negative impression. Needless to say the service was awful. My reservation was confirmed for 6:00. I arrived with my mom to celebrate her birthday around 5:45. Fifteen minutes in, no one has even come to the table to acknowledge us. I had to ask the hostess for our waiter/waitress.  Twenty  minutes pass and not even get a glass of water. So here we are just sitting there and some other waitress comes over to give us water and inform us our waiter will be Brian. Well we finally meet Brian after 30 minutes of just sitting there with water and menus.  We are ready to order at this point. It took another 20 minutes to get our appetizers and they both were room temp. at best.  We just settled and ate them.  I had to later inquire about the salads. Another 5 minutes pass of just sitting there and the manager on duty that day came over (I guess he notice the look of sheer disgust on our faces). I kindly explained to him about the service and temperature of the food.  He really went in defense mood right away and assured me he personally sees to it that all food never sit at the station. He then goes onto to say AREN'T YOU DINING ON GROUPON?. I was highly offended as if a discount on the price should be a discount on the service. We immediately lost our appetites and requested the check and boxes to box both  entrees and prepare the dessert to go. I have never been so humiliated by someone in the service industry and let alone a manager! Unfortunately I did not get his name at this point he was not worth remembering.",

We settled on small plate items, starting with the calamari and it was some of the best I've ever tried.  I honestly can't remember the other food we have because the calamari was so great.  The service is really good and they were eager to help us decide on our wine and recommend dinner entrees.  In terms of draft beer I will say it's a little odd that they don't keep the list up to date.  I saw some taps not listed and they just explained it as it changes so often we don't update the menu.  Strange tactic but lucky for me I'm good with tap identifications!",

We were able to see sunset over the city skyline. Once it got too dark and cold to be outside we moved into the dining room for dinner. I had the smoked chicken with mashed potatoes. Best dish I've had in a long time!! We had salad and dessert as well and I ate way more than I should have but the food was soo soo good! The complimentary valet was also a nice touch since we were running a little late and needed to get in quickly! Thanks Dressler's for showing these out of towners a great evening!",

If you're looking for a great appetizer, try the New Orleans Style Shrimp. For dessert; their homemade cheesecake is absolutely top-notch and divine! Our only negative comment is the acoustics are a little loud and the night we dined the restaurant was a little warm. However, we did understand since it was 100 degrees outside! Overall, would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "I had a very chaotic day and my sweetie decided to surprise me by taking me here. It was a pleasant surprise.   I know this place is usually filled with business people after work.  It wasn't very busy for a Monday night which was a good thing. But oddly, the hostess decided to sit a table of 4 directly beside us, which they were very noisy. It wasn't as if they were packed it was several other tables around instead of directly beside us. The server (Jim) was excellent, I think he was a little nervous but pleasant.  For starters the crab cake dip was a little too creamy for me, but it had very nice chunks of crab, my sweetie loved it. Next time I'll try the Thai calamari.   We ordered the chop salad & Caesar salad, which both were great! The Short Rib with spinach and no bone was present and it was hugh but very tender. I ordered the lamb chops which were excellent in taste, temperature and appearance. The blackened green beans were surprisingly, tasty. To add with it a nice glass of Riesling wine. The cheesecake was very nice and rich (need to share with another, Lol)  Overall, my experience was great and I'm looking forward to coming back and will recommend this place to others.  Oh, this place isn't cheap, so make sure for two people to dine nicely have at least $100 on you. It's well worth it.",

The server was very attentive and friendly. We started off with some cocktails, wine, and salads/apps. I had some berry cocktail, don't remember the name, but it was very yummy. Two of the people in our party split a salad and that made a great starter for them. I split the sausage app and it was very nice as well. (just wish the different sausages would have been explained to us) The meal was paced very nicely and shortly after finishing the apps/salads, we received our entrees. All were delicious. I had trout and it was seasoned perfectly. All the other entrees were very good as well.   From checking in on Yelp, 2 of us were able to get free desserts. I tried Grandma's apple cake and the other was the Apple Crisp. I have to say that I personally liked the apple crisp better because of the crispy top. But the apple cake was very good as well.  Before paying the bill, we gave our server the ticket for the valet. As soon as we walked out, the car was being pulled up.   All-in-all, this was the best service at a restaurant that I have experienced in a long time. Well Done!",

There is patio seating available, which we took advantage of but sadly got rained on =/ We made sure to grab our soups before we ran inside though! We looked MILDLY confused, standing at the door with our soups, before the staff kindly directed us to the dry tables inside lol Our waiter, Taylor was very sweet and accommodating. He brought us new drinks and was very tentative throughout the meal (plus, he was a cutie! lol)  I was surprised at how affordable the lunch prices were for a fancier restaurant. Most of the dishes were about $12 and under. The soups of the day were Brocolli Cream and Tomato Parmesan. OF COURSE we had to get one of each. We also ordered the \"Thai Crispy Calamari\" as the appetizer. There was a kick of wasabi in the sauce, which was unexpected but nonetheless enjoyable. Although, they weren't very crispy which was disappointing. My friend and I both got the \"Grilled Chicken and Risotto.\" The risotto was made perfectly and the chicken was very flavorful. I'm tempted to try the shrimp and grits or the fish  tacos next time! Last, I got creme brulee as dessert. It was very succulent and sweet, but very enjoyable! I got it to-go though so the presentation was horrible. I guess you can't expect to-go creme brulee to be pretty though. Everything was delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary.   Overall: beautiful/trendy ambiance, great service, good food.",

Apparently, the prices they list for liquor are only for drinks on the rocks, which he claims are a larger pour. So, if you decide to have a drink here, remember that they have a system all their own. They do not measure out a shot, like every other bar in the country. They pour more than a shot (though I didn't see the increase) and charge an additional fee (without note in the menu or any word from the server) if you order neat.",

I had been there once on a business meeting dinner, and loved it - so I took my boyfriend back using the half off deal.  The food is excellent, and always is. Our bubbly and informative waiter started us off with the Thai Crispy Calamari appetizer ($11). It's crunchy and savory, tossed in a house made  thai peanut glaze with wasabi aioli.  We shared  the G's House Salad ( $6 ) With mixed greens, goat cheese, apple caramelized onions, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette. This salad is super savory and this is when I fell inlove with goat cheese.  Then we made our entree orders. I got the 'Just for the Halibut'  ($29) with lump crab on top and amazing sauce this entree was terrific. The fish was tender and flaky, and I wish I could bottle the sauce and take it home to use on my own cooking. My boyfriend had the Ribeye ($29) which was cooked perfectly, I had to reach across the plate and grab some.  Finally - even though we were stuffed- we ordered carrot cake to go so we could enjoy it later. I also would suggest Mom's Apple Cake, which I had previous to this visit.  Overall great experience, staff, atmosphere and food. We've already got another deal for Dressler's!",

Our waitress was very attentive, as were the bus boys.    We had a Living Social or Groupon, so I was skeptical to the level of service we would get (as this has been a problem with other places).  I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case.  When I told our waitress we had a groupon, she remained just as attentive as she had been when we first got there.  The outdoor seating is also really great and they often have live music. The views from outside and by the windows of the restaurant are some of the best in CLT. Perfect for a summer date night.    The food is good. My favorite thing was the Low Country Crab Dip.  I wasn't HUGE fan of their cheesecake -- but everything else was nice!  My husband and I will definitely return to Dressler's for another date night! You should too!",

And served our orders. While this was happening a jazz band played nearby that was nice and the lights of downtown kept things lively with our conversation. We all made different selections. I saw so many interesting things I just ordered three appetizers. Melted gooey Pimento cheese with bacon crumbles and jelly? and crusty bread; the house chefs salad that seemed like a Cobb salad, and an order of French fries with ketchup and aioli. I never have fries so I was being bad. Pimento cheese was terrific, but if they had come with homemade porkrinds instead of crusty bread, it would have been a knockout and a no carb diet lovers dream ( I can get this is my home, Goldsboro, NC). Salad was salad, nothing to write home about, and the fries were served in a large champaign flute for style. I think the total price was $28 which also included a bourbon with ice water. We were a large group so a gratuity was added in, but on the itemization for paying there was a line to add a tip too which might confuse some who are not aware. I had a terrific time and very much enjoyed the meal. And the service fr such a large group was ideal, couldn't be better.",

We started with the crab dip as an appetizer. There were large lumps of crap meat in a melted cheese dip that came with sliced bread-and it was the perfect bread/dip ratio! I feel like that NEVER happens. For dinner my hubs had the ribeye with a blue cheese spread on top, fingerling potatoes, & asparagus. It was delicious!! I had the shrimp and grits, which thankfully my husband was there to help me eat it all. The portion was huge! It had really large shrimp in it, andouille sausage, tiny diced red pepper, onion, & celery in it. The sauce on it had really good flavor, but wasn't spicy. I love a good shrimp and grits. And lastly, because our waiter talked up the cheesecake so much, we had to try it! He said the three 'momma' desserts are all recipes from one of the owners. The cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had. It was more fluffy then dense, and I loved it.",

    "text": "Sooooooooo good. We dined on one of the famous groupons and let me tell you, that's the greatest deal ever (but don't forget to tip your waitstaff accordingly - not based on the deeply discounted rate). I felt bad as our waitress had clearly been burned that way before and told us about it. The crab dip is amazing (needs a touch of salt but it's delightful)! The mini (kiddo) ordered chicken Alfredo and no joke, we all kept stealing forkfuls of his tasty garlicky & cheesy meal (SO GOOD!!). I ordered the filet and while tasty, the sauce it comes with is unnecessary and makes it almost inedible because of the salty factor - I wiped it off and everything was fine again. Service is always top notch and the food is always hot, fresh and great quality when we've been in. There's quite the eclectic crowd most nights (date nights to casual family diners) - we actually like that! The desserts are good but if you get them to go, you're clued into the secret as they come home cold/hard and are evidently heated for revitalization-sake. The rice patty that comes with the tuna is so unique and tasty - I wish I could replicate it at home! Parking can be a bear in this spot, but just head to the upper levels of the deck and save the head ache of valet or self-park attempts on the main level of the garage. Groupon saves the day with the 4 course offer..... don't miss out!",

Everything was delicious and the service was superior to any other restaurant we've been to in Charlotte thus far! I only wish my steak was prepared as requested, I had ordered it rare and it was most definitely medium-well done and I found the topping on the KC strip to be heavily salted. I didn't return the steak to be re-done, because we were already using a Groupon and receiving a steep discount. But the prices there are very high, so for a $40 steak I would normally have been extremely disappointed in how overcooked it was. The Halibut made up for it all tho! Absolutely delicious and worth every penny spent! Groupon or No Groupon!",

I sat at the bar and started off with \"Why So Cereal\" beer (by Legion brewing)- I haven't seen this beer on tap at any other place. If you like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, I highly recommend trying it.  A fellow patron recommended the \"Just for the Halibut\" (lump crab, roasted red peppers, spinach, potato cake, sun dried tomato beurre blanc)....WOW WOW WOW! The halibut cut like butter, and was absolutely delicious. I was planning on saving half for the next day, but that didn't happen. I was also informed that the calamari is some of the best in town, so I will definitely be back to try it!  ***If you order an entree, you can get one dessert for free by checking in on Yelp*** I chose the chocolate mousse cake, which was good, but I was told that Mom's cheesecake is fabulous!!   John Dressler was walking around the restaurant and came over to say hi to the regulars at the bar. Such a nice man and is very dedicated to making sure that every restaurant that he owns is the best that it can possibly be. Bravo! Dressler's is 5+ stars.",

    "text": "Pricey but good for a date night or special event / celebration. Food can be hit or miss, as can the service. Most of the time it's been good though.  The charcuterie board is usually really good with really unique cheeses and meats sourced internationally. The last time we went though, they messed ours up and put one of the (3) cheeses twice. We brought this to our waiter's attention and he brought out the correct cheese on a separate plate for us. So just be aware in case.  As for the steaks, I do NOT recommend getting any steak \"Blackened\" because here that means a completely charred 'crust'. The first time I went I got the \"Blackened Heart of Ribeye\" and was very disappointed in how bitter and chewy it was. The next time I opted for a more tender cut of meat and selected the Filet, but our waiter recommended getting it 'blackened' to make it even better. Not making the connection of what that meant, I went ahead and took his suggestion...and was thoroughly disappointed. It was so unbelievably bitter that the beautiful filet was completely ruined for me. I tried to politely mention it when our waiter returned to ask how everything was and he essentially just looked confused and said \"well, everyone's tastes are different. It's hard to recommend things since not everyone like the same things.\" Yes...that's True...but that doesn't help the fact that I paid a lot of money for something I did not enjoy.  The wine selection is decent and they have a decent selection of craft cocktails as well. The desserts are all amazing. And it's worth noting that they always have another \"flavor\" of cheesecake beyond their traditional NY style, so make sure to ask what it is.",

I ate a few bites and couldn't fathom how the kitchen could send out a piece of meat in that condition. I didn't even send it back. My husband did. The rest of the food was just OK. Several people sent their desserts back. I thought my apple cake wasn't very moist. Verdict: Never coming back to this place again and I don't recommend it.

    "text": "Disclaimer: This review is during restaurant week! That being said they did a great job.  After a fun-filled Yelp event, me and my girlfriend decided to take advantage of Charlotte Restaurant Week. Unfortunately for us, it's hard to find reservations last minute during Queen's Feast! We did happen upon Dressler's in Midtown with one time slot open and took advantage of it.  Arrived right on time and we were promptly seated. Usually the big con to restaurant week is that the service and speed of the restaurant can suffer due to artificially increased business that any given place may not be used to. Pleased to say that Dressler's appeared to be veterans to this event as our orders were promptly taken, our drinks stayed full, and the food came out at a fast yet still comfortable pace!  For appetizers, I got a Wedge Salad and Kristen got the Pimento Cheese with Toast. Had I seen that the Wedge Salad had bleu cheese on it I probably wouldn't have gotten it, but damn it that salad was actually really good! Maybe I haven't had good balance of cheese in my experiences with this in the past, but it was fresh and well rounded with sharp red onion and a simple dressing with the perfect amounts. The pimento cheese was great as well, but I was more focused on the salad!  Entrees: I decided on the Salmon with tomato risotto and Kristen got the Chicken with Creamed Spinach. Again, was a little dark to see the menu tonight and missed that the risotto was accompanied with tomatoes. Again, another one of my \"meh\" flavor profiles, but once again I was exceedingly surprised by the quality and freshness of it. The tomatoes were outstanding and risotto perfectly cooked with a subtle nuttiness to the grain. Blown away by the salmon, perfect sear with a great seasoning, and a med-rare center that was not to be beat!  Stuffed, we got dessert to go. The restaurant offered an apple and a carrot cake so we got both to split at home. Good cake, but nothing really special. I had only the carrot cake and without the icing I feel like it wouldn't stand well on its own. Still satisfied either way!  The only real con to the night was that with the restaurant being so packed, it had the noise level of a high school cafeteria. I feel like service suffered just a bit because of this as well, but there was no challenging that the staff were doing the best that they could and executed very well as far as the food goes. It just seemed like some of them were worn out now in the final stretch of Queen's Feast. Not mad in the least!  Will look forward to an evening where I can see them on a regular week, and I have no doubt that they will blow me away with the service next time.",

Ambiance is always great, with big, floor to ceiling window views to Charlotte's skyline. Unfortunately, given that we were a big group, we were not seated right by the window. If the weather was warmer, I'd suggest sitting outdoors as well...again, amazing skyline views! That said, we were comfortably seated by the dark burgundy wall, decked with some contemporary artwork. I never noticed this before, but the acoustics were much louder than I had remembered...but after several minutes in, we all adjusted enough to hear one another. Now, the food!! Again, as expected, it was amazing!  I decided to try their Short Ribs, with a side order of Spinach...and well, let's just say that I nearly slurped up the plate. Looking at others' plates around the table, I can't imagine anyone NOT enjoying their food here. Things ARE pricey here, but unlike some restaurants where you pay a fortune for a drop of meat and skimpy portion of veggies, you WILL get your money's worth. Not sure if that statement applies for the drinks though. I chose their Strawberry Cocktail, and though very good, it WAS a bit skimpy. Also, the dessert selection could be improved a bit. While good, there was nothing extraordinary or unique about it. Still, when it comes to upscaled American foods, this is probably one of my favorites in town...and I definitely plan on returning to try a few more items off the menu!",

The filet mignon was among the best I've had in the city or anywhere for that matter.  Perfectly roasted fingerlings were a great compliment.  Finally, the waiter brought out toasted Cheerwine pound cake with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and a candle for our birthday!  Asa, our waiter, made our experience the best!",

I had the crab dip for an appetizer and it was devoured so fast i didn't get to take any pictures. For my entree I had the roasted salmon with risotto and I was a little hesitant because I had never tried it before but our server assured me it would melt in your mouth. Needless to say it was a perfect pair with the salmon that was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got the 9oz filet mignon and I was amazing as well. He really didn't even require a knife to cut the steak because it was that tender and so flavorful. We will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "I recently went to this restaurant to meet up with an old college friend. We actually celebrated \"old friends catching up\" and the launch of my new romance novella, \"The Violet Rose\" ( To find out how to get a copy check out my website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.creativecalfuray.com&s=5486341a34f52238dc00b5c0db5372ca48b81fec9a82db332df2f4352e52a42d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">creativecalfuray.com</a>)!   This restaurant was superb! Our waitress, \"Bobbi\" was amazing! She brought us complimentary champagne, so that we could toast to celebrating the wonderful events in our friendship! She was very helpful in deciding on our main dinner entrees because, everything looked delicious. I had the Prime KC Strip and potatoes and my friend had the lobster tails. We both ordered a couple of \"old fashions\" and the bartender did an excellent job on mixing our cocktails. We were later joined by an another friend that arrived just in time to have dessert. He ordered the \"Mom's Apple Cake\" and it was to die for!  I thoroughly enjoyed dinner. There was just enough hustle and bustle for the evening dinner crowd, that it was simply perfect for dining. By the time we left, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant besides us. One touch that I loved was that, our waitress asked if we needed our ticket validated for parking, and not only did she validate it, but gave our ticket to the valet and when we finally left the restaurant our car was already waiting. The was perfect because, it had literally started pouring down raining just moments before we left. Now that's great service! I will definitely come back and I highly recommend this restaurant that may be dining in the Huntersville/Charlotte area.",

Got to dresslers & got seated all the way in the back in a room with guest with loud parties. One they knew it was our anniversary because they said happy anniversary when we walked in after I gave them my name. So sitting in a room with loud guest was not my ideal spot for my anniversary so that irritated me a bit. Asked to me seated else where and it was perfect.   Now to the food we did a three course meal which was super yummy. Only complaint was the smoked steak my hubs got was a bit too smoked lol it tasted burnt. But my lamb was Devine I loved it. Our waiter was super nice with packing up our leftovers as we ate because it was so much food to go through. Overall good food but just the hostess should of read the mood better when seating us.",

Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu, attentive, and the quality of the food was impressive for the size of our party.  The beef short rib was very flavorful and tender. The staff explained to us that it was slow roasted for 4-5 hours slowly before serving. This dish was very worth it! The shrimp and grits were also impressive! I grew up on the coast in GA, so this dish is a staple in my hometown. The combination of shrimp, crab, and sausage are all boldly pulled together by the creamy, yet flavorful grits! I could eat this dish for breakfast , lunch, or dinner! Tonight we also tried the shrimp linguine. The sauce was very light but full of fresh garlic flavor. I would definitely recommend visiting Dressler's for an enjoyable evening dinner, even if you have a large party.",

He gave us a warm welcome, explained the history about Dressler's and started us off with complimentary Prosecco! We ordered the crab dip and man... it was so delicious. For our entrees I ordered the lamb and my bf ordered the blackened ribeye. Hands down, was the best lamb I ever had! It was juicy and oh so flavorful! My bf's steak was eye popping delicious. He got the herb butter instead of the blue cheese and it was the perfect touch to the steak. To top off the night, they treated us with a complimentary desert of Strawberry pound cake w/ vanilla ice cream! The waiter shared that it wasn't even on the menu - I urged (somewhat begged) him to have them add it to the menu bc it was THAT damn good. Ever ate food that made you feel warm, cozy, and loved all over? Yeah that was us that night.   Fast-forward to Clt restaurant week. We brought our friends who never been for a double date night. It was packed but we had reservations. Long story short, my bf and I ordered the ribeye steak. Unfortunately, it was not as good as the first time. It was actually quite disappointing bc my bf's was somewhat burnt. Seems like the chefs rushed through the meals due to the volume of ppl. Quality shouldn't be compromised bc of being busy. Despite that, we still had great service, appetizers (I got the pimento cheese), and dessert (I got the cheesecake).",

We used a Groupon as well, GREAT deal for what you got, and what a gorgeous day to sit outside. Agree, the staff tries to be absolutely the best (familiar with other Dressler's restaurants, Jon does a great job of hiring the right people. . server wise). We were there for an early dinner & it was not crowded whatsoever. Our server, Richard was clearly proud to be working there and offered many excellent selections. However, there was what appeared to be a *manager* who wanted to make darn sure that nobody received any special treatment. We enjoyed chatting with our server, Richard, who was an absolute sweetheart.  As I said, the place wasn't crowded (most people sat outside, the inside was about empty). You'd think they were packed to the gills considering how that *manager* (cranky and rude) kept stopping by our table & others to bark orders at the servers. What a creep - despite the great food (calamari, crab cake, lamb chops, Cesar salad, lamb (a bit fatty - REALLY) and a delicious halibut dish, that *manager* was a crank, had the staff unsettled and actually dropped a bill in front of me after we'd already paid ours and included a generous cash tip. Our server quickly said he'd already taken care of the bill, so the creep who dropped HIS bill right in front of ME (not my husband) just said \"oh\" and picked it back up. . .I wonder what it would have had written in it!  Hope this guy isn't a relative of Jon D.'s. . .who is renown for putting his family to work (his mom makes the BEST DESSERTS!!!). Just so sad to leave what was originally an upbeat and happy occasion with such a downhearted feeling. I doubt we'll be back anytime soon.  . .sadly.",

I had the blackened ribeye with bleu cheese butter- OMG- it was divine!! My husband had the filet and mashed potatoes- both steaks were cooked perfectly. The server did great, the meal was timed perfectly and we had a great view of downtown Charlotte! I can wait to go back and try some of the other things on their menu.

This has by far been the best dining experience I have ever had, and if I end up in Charlotte again I will certainly be back!  Food: Calamari (nice and thick, very flavorful) Goat Cheese (absolutely perfect) Crab cakes (plenty of crab meat without much filler, just how I like them) Asparagus (fantastic and only slightly crisp) Apple Cake (which they brought out as one cake with candles before warming it in the back -people were raving about this into the next day!)  Drinks: The wine selection was amazing, as was the options for coffee after dinner.   Overall, our event would not have been as nearly wonderful if it were elsewhere. Everything either met or exceeded expectations and the restaurant, staff, food, and ambiance were well received and enjoyed by all of the attendees.",

    "text": "Really really good.  Solid meal, solid service, solid specials.  We dined at Dressler's on a Sunday.  We had plans to see a friend playing at the Double Door, so we stopped at the Metropolitan to choose a restaurant.  First of all - love the Metropolitan!  What a cool multi-use development with great city views - which we proceeded to enjoy from the huge windows of Dressler's.  From the first sips of our wine to our very last bites, we were impressed!  First, a nice half-price wine surprise...our server brought the wine menu (on an Ipad - nice modern approach, guys!), and we chose the last bottle of a lovely reasonably priced sparkling golden Pinot Noir.  Our server was great.  I hate that I can't quite remember her name, but I think it was Ellis???... My husband enjoyed joking around with her.  We decided to try the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer.  It was served with a country Dijon sauce, greens and an unusual accompaniment: cold boiled shrimp, either boiled in ginger water or certainly in a ginger marinade. Interesting and refreshing!  Entrees were fabulous.  I enjoyed the grouper and was able to order it with the corn risotto (which was so nicely cooked, not mushy) and citrus beurre blanc, a preparation actually presented with salmon on the menu.  My husband devoured the crispy duck, which was accompanied by mapled potatoes and other root veggies, I believe.  I had to practically beg for a bite - delicious!  We did not partake in dessert, but learned that the owner's mother makes the restaurant's cheesecakes and carrot cake daily.  They all sounded wonderful.  We saw two other groups singing Happy Birthday to dining companions.  This is a special place.",

They have an outdoor patio with really nice furniture. It was a little chilly, but I'm sure it is quite nice in the spring and summer. The organization that I'm apart of planned heavy horderves. We had chicken, bacon wrapped scallops, beef tenderloins, low country crab dip, goat cheese&garlic on pita bread, and lump crab cake. I kid you not when I say \"Every single item was cooked to perfection!\" I plan on going back with my husband. Excellent job Dressler Metropolitan!",

    "text": "I don't think I've ever given a place a 5 star review after the first visit.  I generally don't think it's a good idea because I tend to get food-struck at a lot of restaurants.  But I can tell this is more than just passing 'Whoa!!' moment - this place is just absolutely fantastic.  The decor inside is very modern upscale, but with a whole lot of color thrown around the place.  The tables were spaced out nicely without being overly crowded.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly.  Our server Jason was probably the best server I've ever had - he really made some great recommendations and was very attentive and friendly.  I could tell that was really enthusiastic about this place.  He even asked from the start whether we had a Groupon, and he really took that as an opportunity to showcase some of the best items on the menu.  To start with, my partner and I ordered the calamari, which was drizzled with a Thai peanut sauce and came with a Wasabi aioli (he thought the aioli was wonderful; horseradish of any kind is my kryptonite).  It was perfectly cooked and the best calamari I've ever had.  For entrees, my partner ordered the 'Just for the Halibut' (I just love the catchy name).  The halibut was tender and perfectly cooked, and the spinach and chive potato cake were also quite wonderful.  I ordered the sauteed mahi mahi, which came with a gnocchi, bacon, and asparagus tips - the flavors paired together so well, it's one of the top 5 meals I've ever eaten.    For dessert, I ordered the apple cake and he ordered the carrot cake.  The apple cake was good but needed more of the caramel drizzle.  The carrot cake was truly fabulous!  I loved the icing, which was not too sweet and heavy on the cream cheese flavor.  Paired with our wine selections, it was an absolutely fabulous meal.  The downsides: even with our Groupon, which we had $50 to spend, we still spent an additional $60 + tip.  The parking situation at the Metro is a bit of a nightmare, having to fight the massive amounts of people in the crowded parking garage.  However, they do offer valet parking if you're into that sort of thing.  Was it a little pricey?  Yes.  Was it worth it?  EVERY PENNY!  I can't wait until another special occasion where I can splurge on a wonderful dinner here.  This place made an already wonderful day into a perfect one.  Thanks Dressler's - and especially, thanks to our waiter Jason!",

    "text": "Ok, so where do I begin?  This place is amazing and has a perfect location with a great view of uptown.  In the summer, there is live music outside where they have outside dining.  I would definitely recommend making a reservation here.   The staff is amazing.  I used to be a hostess here and people only walked out beyond satisfied.  Servers, Asa and Kent, received the most compliments while I worked there.  However, all the servers are great.  Very knowledgeable of the menu and their food is local.    My favorite dishes are the lamb, scallops, the goat cheese app, and the calamari.  Must try the calamari! It is one of a kind.  This place also has great desserts which are made by Jon Dressler's mom herself.  I recommend the cheesecake but everyone seems to prefer the apple cake.  I will try it next time but cheese cake is my favorite dessert so it just made sense.  Great for events.  There are back rooms which can be held for receptions or other formal occasions.    There is a dress code so don't go in wearing gym clothes unless you are Greg Olsen.   There is delivery but you must go through Foodie Call.     Definitely check this place out.  Can't wait to check out the new restaurant opening in South Park this November",

    "text": "We took full advantage of a Groupon for a 4 course dinner for two and my husband and I decided to visit Dressler's Metro for the first time on my Birthday, Wednesday, September 6, 2017.  I grew up in a family entrenched in the food industry, as my father's companies manufactured restaurant equipment and we were always around great chefs and fabulous restaurants. So when I say this restaurant is spot on fabulous, I know from experience.  From the very moment we walked in, we were greeted by management, then seated at the most special table called \"Hollywood\".  Groupon instructs that you present your Groupon immediately, and we did.  Megan our server explained our choices and we were delighted to know that the entire menu was available to us, even with the Groupon.  I will tell you one of the best features of this Restaurant is it's menu, as it's elegant without being complicated.  Better yet, the food is excellent.  Beautifully presented and delicious. We noticed many special touches throughout our experience and continued attentiveness by our lovely server.  We require non-alcoholic beverages and our server offered to prepared the most special lemonades for us. My husband's entree, Braised Beef Short Ribs with mashed potatoes and port wine reduction sauce was perfectly delicious.  My Jumbo Shrimp Linguini with roasted grape tomatoes and parmesan cream was beyond my expectations.  We finished with two of Mother Dressler's signature deserts. Our server gifted my dessert with a candle, the most spectacular chocolate mousse cake and my husband finished with Joan Dressler's signature cheese cake, which was light and creamy with a delightful crunchy crust.  In summary, we enjoyed an evening at Dressler's which we will always remember.  The setting was romantic and our experience was absolutely perfect.  Thank you Dressler's Metro and sweet Megan, we will be back to see you soon.",

After the place we originally decided to go to was packed, we found ourselves at Dressler's. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise as our experience was fantastic!  When we walked in, we were greeted and our coats were checked. We were in a bit of a hurry as we had to get back for an evening event at the conference and the waiter was more than accommodating. He made sure that we got our food efficiently without sacrificing quality - and the steak was to die for! Perfectly cooked and delicious.   The waiter also gave us numerous recommendations for other things to do or places to go while we were in town. And to give us the full \"Dressler's experience\" he also brought out 2 desserts on the house - a cheesecake and an apple bundt cake. I can't speak to the bundt as I don't love apple desserts personally, but the cheesecake was wonderfully light and just the right amount of sweet.   Overall, it was a great experience at Dressler's!",

Let's just start with, go, don't question it, you want to eat here. One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Charlotte, and I'm reminded of this ever time I go.  Dressler's is a super comfortable space. By that I mean you can get away with wearing jeans and enjoying music on a lovely patio with views of the skyline, or you can come for a fancy pants event or a romantic date. It feels right no matter what. I love the wine wall, very different than anything I've seen before.   The service, amazing tonight, amazing every night. The worst service I've ever had at Dressler's is better than good service at most establishments. Staff has great menu knowledge and recommendations. Manager is always around and working just as hard as the rest of the staff.  The real star of the show, the food. Appetizers, crab dip all day every day! It's cheesy and gooey and loaded with crab and pure amazingness. Also I love the calamari, tender with a great kick from the wasabi drizzle. I'm a creature of habit but have tried a few entrees. My numero uno, the Halibut! The combo is perfect, sauteed greens, crispy potato cake, tender halibut, topped with crab and this perfect sauce. Yummms! I give runner up to the ribeye with blue cheese and those fingerling potatoes.   Dressler's, delicious, friendly, free valet is you don't want to walk across the street, great patio view, you won't be disappointed.",

While I didn't order it, they say the onion soup was superb.  I enjoyed the Cajun Chicken and Pasta.  It was probably my favorite chicken pasta dish I have had in a long time.  Those that ordered the fish tacos stated they were great.    No one at our table ordered the burger but our neighboring table did. Wow!  If you could have seen how big the burger was - quite impressive.   When it was time for dessert we could not pass up the chocolate chip peanut butter cheesecake.  I posted a picture as it was unbelievable.  This is a restaurant I would go to again and again.    Valet parking albeit there is a parking deck across the street.  Patio dining if so desired.

Our server and the ambiance of the entire restaurant was very nice. I appreciated even the couture art in the bathrooms.   Jumping into what we ordered: 2 appetizers: crab dip and calamari fillet. The crap dip was pretty good and popular menu item as I saw multiple parties ordering. The calamari fillet I likely would not order again, as I prefer a crispy texture vs rubbery.   1 salad split: I cannot recall the name of the salad we tried but it had goat cheese, caramelized onions, and candied pecans with a balsamic glaze. Very tasty.   2 entrees: Our server recommended that we try the 9 oz filet but substitute the Demi glaze for the garlic butter that is usually served with the ribeye. Amazing! The outside had a slight char to it that I really enjoyed. Although we ordered it medium, and it came out medium well - I was still satisfied.   1 dessert: The apple cake was delicious. The Carmel crisp on the edges mixed with the vanilla ice cream was phenomenal! They also had an Oreo cheesecake special which I am determined to return for.   All in all, a great experience and I am happy to return.",

I  had the \"Just for the Halibut\" .. it's like you have a 3 course meal: it's fish and crab meat and spinach on top of a potato cake ...very fulfilling and loaded of flavor. My husband had the Ribeye now the ribeye is not like your regular ribeye it's more thick and round. My husband wanted it cooked medium but it came out as medium well. The waiter got the manager (my husband did not complain, she was just doing her job and asking us how was our food). The manager ended up cooking my husband another ribeye cook medium. My husband did say both ribeyes tasted good.  Dessert was good too. (See photos)",

Our waiter made recommendations and kept drinks filled and was very attentive.  For a meal, I went with a Delmonico steak special which was huge and quite good even though it was cooked medium instead of medium rare as I had ordered it. The chocolate cheesecake for dessert was also good.  The problem I have with Dresslers is a problem I have with many other restaurants. It was just too loud. We are a dinner group and enjoy conversation. It would be nice to be able to hear that conversation over the noise from people at other tables across the room.  Still the food is good here and the service is excellent. I'd come back here with a smaller group.",

    "text": "Great place. I came here years ago and went again recently for mother's day. They had a special menu for the holiday. The server was attentive and staff were welcoming and friendly. You get a great view of down town Charkotte and if the weather is nice you can sit outside and relax. I had the mozzarella basil and tomato appetizer which was simple yet tasteful. I was able to sample the calamari which was seasoned well. I had the rack of lamb with potatoes which were delicious. The crab cakes were good as well. Now the desserts- carrot cake is a super large portion and yummy. The cheese cake is soft in texture and lighter definitely pleasant. The pecan pie I have advertised I didn't get to sample before it was devoured so it was good and a limited time special. The restroom was clean and the music wasn't over bearing. I would recommend and would like to return for drinks.",

    "text": "What a splendid restaurant in midtown Charlotte! Dressler's has it all -- well-crafted food, attentive service, and classy ambience.   My group started out with an order of the lump crab dip. This dip was delicious and there were actually substantial lumps of CRAB in it (unlike other crab dips I've had). For my entree, I ordered the halibut and it was phenomenal. The fish was flaky and cooked perfectly. The spinach and potato cake completed the dish and gave it a well-balanced flavor. I also sampled the black and blue ribeye (LOVED!), the filet mignon (also amazing), and the tuna (great fish, but wasn't a fan of the dish as a whole). The cuts of beef were high quality and the meat was tender and flavorful.   It's imperative that you save room for dessert! If you check in on yelp, you even get one free! I had the cheesecake and the warm apple cake. While the cheesecake was light and fluffy and had a delightful cinnamon flavor, the warm apple cake was the superstar. This cake was INCREDIBLE -- I'm still thinking about it.   Overall, this is such a classy restaurant and would be the perfect place for a celebration. Not only was the food amazing, but the service was splendid. Kurtis was our waiter and he was superb. I'll definitely be back to Dressler's next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "An anniversary dinner for the memory book.  Friends of ours rave about their celebratory dinner at Dresslers and after reading so many of the awesome reviews I knew for sure this is where I wanted enjoy our anniversary dinner.   Since our anniversary falls right after the Hollidays, we're typically dining in quiet restaurants and this was no different.  Very few other patrons tonight but certainly not deficient in the attention we received.  We were seated by the window which offered a beautiful skyline view of Charlotte.  Our server, Kennedy, was so attentive and pleasant.     We started out with the sauted gnocchi and the seared Ahi Tuna appetizers.  While on two opposite sides of the taste spectrum they were both equally delicious.  We kept swapping plates so that we'd each have an equal share.  We then shared the G's House salad.  Deliciously dressed greeens with candied walnuts, apple slices and fresh goat cheese.  I appreciated how they separated the salad into a portion size for each of us.    Then we moved onto the highlights...Braised Short Rib over a pillow of creamy mashed potatoes for me and the DelMonico steak, also with mashed potatoes and fresh local spinach for the hubby.   Portions were generous enough for both of us to pack up some left overs for lunch tomorrow.  We needed to save room for dessert.  Which I'm so glad I did.  I had heard so much about the cheesecake and when I took that first bite it certainly did not dissapoint!  My husband chose one of his all time faves, cartot cake.  Now I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake but I could have easily eaten this entire piece.    Thank you Dresslers for making our 21st anniversary dinner one of our best yet!!",

    "text": "To celebrate our wedding anniversary with our rugrats, we decided to try Dressler's.  We were greeted by two hosts and I believe the manager of the establishment.  We were seated in a booth and before we settled down, of course we had to have a round of musical chairs with the rugrats. Shortly after we sat, the manager kindly presented us with a glasses of champagne to wish us a Happy Anniversary.   So far the first 15 minutes at Dressler's has been pleasant.  Let's start off with the appetizers that we ordered.  Rugrats ordered the Thai Peanut Calamari. Which was not bad at all.  I just wished  the calamari was a bit more crispier.  The peanut sauce was absolutely delicious!  Appetizer #2 we ordered the grilled boar tenderloin - which was a A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Rugrats loved the boar and thought it was extremely  tender and delicious.  Appetizer #3 was the crab cakes.  Have to say, there was nothing special about the crab cake and I was too thrilled about the remoulade that accompanied the crab cake. Appetizer #4 New Orleans Shrimp was the fourth dish that was amazing!  I believe I was only able to get one shrimp because the Rugrats ate all.  For the salad choices we stuck with the usual.  Cesar salad which was good and G's salad.  The G's Salad had candied walnuts, goat cheese, apples and caramelized onions.  The salads were good but we didn't get to finish because we wanted to save room for the main course.  For the main course, hubby and I ordered the Braised Boneless Beef Short Rib.  It was tender and moist.  The port wine Demi glace was amazing for the Beef Short Rib.  Rugrat #1 ordered the KC steak with fries and devoured half the steak with no issues.  That should tell you how well made the steak when a child is able to finish half of the steak.  Rugrat #2 ordered the Salmon.  The dish came out great and and the salmon tasted amazing.  Unfortunately, Rugrat #2 only wanted to eat Rugrat #1's steak.  To end our meal, I had a cup of cappuccino with my creme brulee as the Rugrats shared a Chocolate Raspberry cake.  We agreed that we would all come back again and try something new!  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant for date night, girls get together and family night.",

    "text": "OK, every now and then you have one of those amazing experiences that stops you in your tracks and makes you reflect.  I waited a day before I wrote this review so I would have some time to reflect and compare.   If you are in a rush the short version is:  Food is extremely well prepared, Desserts are out of this world, Service is warm and professional.  I travel a lot and this was seriously a top experience.   More Detail: This was our first time at this restaurant: We had dinner for six and a special occasion for my daughter's birthday. Other than that, it was a normal Tuesday evening in a restaurant.  We parked using the valet that is immediately outside the entrance. Others in our party used the parking garage that is directly across the street. (Those who know me understand why I add parking information: If it is difficult to park I generally go elsewhere unless it is for business.)   We were immediately greeted, recognized and shown our table. We preferred to sit inside the restaurant as opposed to the lovely covered area outside.  We had a nice view overlooking a wooded area that led to a nice view of Charlotte's skyline.   The server was not rushed and took her time introducing herself and shared in conversation.  The restaurant manager, \"Kent\" came to our table early in our visit and warmly welcomed us.  He was completely aware of the birthday and frankly made us all feel like we were part of the \"Dressler\" family.  The Kent was constantly in motion.  He seemed to know what was going on at each table, in the kitchen and at the entrance. He was attentive in the most professional manner throughout our visit. This gentleman is a professional and he knows what he is doing.    I did not meet the chef, however, I was very impressed that he or she was not afraid to season the food.  Nothing over the top with seasoning, but the chef knew what he/she was trying to achieve and did it. Very impressive results. I will add some pictures.  At our table we had, salmon, duck, steaks, and tuna. The presentation was supreme, and again.... the food was seasoned by a professional who is not afraid to demonstrate their skills.   The bar menu is on an iPad and includes some very creative drinks with a myriad of bases (bourbon, vodka, tequila, infused etc..).  Dessert:  In general I either don't eat dessert or at a minimum eschew cakes.  The manager talked me into trying some of the cakes.  I won't go into detail, but you must try....well... all of them. Remember, I do not eat cake. However, I did eat cake and will again when back in Charlotte.  When I go back to Dressler's.    I have no hesitation in recommending Dressler's to anyone who appreciates a quality chef, a warm environment, and courteous service.",

Everything else was among the best I've had. We started with the low country crab dip which was great. I had the blackened heart of ribeye with herb blue cheese topping with fingerling potatos. It was to die for. My date had the filet mignon with the roasted mushroom demi glaze and mashed potatos. She loves it. Atmosphere is elegant without being stuffy. Service was very good. All around it was a great experience. They have become my new go-to for a nice dinner out in Charlotte.",

Mostly that they were even open, at first.  Also because there were not a lot of people. Guess most don't realize that they are open at lunch. Regardless, it was certainly a pleasant surprise. They have a nice location right on or next to or above the greenway, and if the weather ever cooperates, there is even some outdoor seating - though I'm not really certain if you can get served there or if it's for people who are walking or passing through.  Either way, it does provide a nice view while you're dining. And the staff provides for some solid service as well, though for not having a bunch of people there it can be a touch on the slow side, but it's definitely worth the wait as it's a tasty surprise.",

We sat at a table near the window and had a great view. Our waiter was very friendly, immediately greeted us and wished us Happy Anniversary! He brought us 2 glasses of champagne to celebrate. We order pimento cheese and calamari for appetizers. They were fantastic! The pimento cheese was very flavorful and the bread with them had the right amount of crunch and softness combined. The calamari was very tender and flavorful. I ordered the heart of ribeye and it was oh so tender and had good flavor. The mashed potatoes were so light and had the right amount of seasoning. My husband had the rack of lamb and it was soo good. It was tender! We had cheer wine cake and cheesecake for desert. My husband was in heaven with the cake. It was warm and moist. The cheesecake was so light. We will definitely return!! We loved everything!",

Salad was just ok, appetizer was the only thing I'd order again (Gnocchi's). As am entree I ordered KC Strip Medium Rare and was brought a steak that was Med Well leaning to well. Server seemed irked by the fact that I let him know it was very over cooked. The manger came out and apologized and within the next 15/20 minutes I had a Med Rare steak...but by that time my wife had already finished eating. The Garilc Butter sauce that was on it was not good at all. Granted we were using a groupon, but they should have at least comped us one of our drinks for the issue. The  bill would've been 160$ had we not used this 75$ Groupon...I would never pay that for this quality or Service",

The ambiance is amazing and to further things we sat outside during a beautiful night with an awesome view of downtown Charlotte. Very romantic :).  The food was absolutely terrific as usual. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get calamari anywhere after having Dresslers' calamari. The best parts of calamari lightly dipped in wasabi sauce and a signature sauce. Phenomenal! I had the scallop salad and thinking the scallops would be small but they were definitely jumbo but the salad was not too filling. My fiancee got the blackened heart of ribeye which he said was cooked to perfection. After trying a bite I agreed.  The thing that really sets Dresslers apart for me from other restaurants in Charlotte is the service. Kent was our server and he made the dining experience one of the best I've ever had. Extremely attentive and he even convinced me to try the scallop salad. He even said he remembered us coming in and we got a complimentary dessert and sherry for celebrating our anniversary there! Just an unbelieveable dining experience and would recommend this restaurant to anyone in Charlotte.",

    "text": "We opted to revisit Dressler's for our anniversary. Our Appetizer was Low Country Crab Dip and scrumptious in every bite. For entree we had the Blackened Heart of Ribeye which came with  fingerling potatoes, asparagus, herb blue cheese butter. My wife enjoyed the Just For The Halibut with lump crab, roasted red peppers, spinach, chive potato cake, sun dried tomato buerre blanc. Our dessert was a shared Mom's Apple Cake ...enough said...caramel, ice cream -delicious. Our wait staff was attentive but not overly intrusive and Natalie was very informed in terms of the menu. We were not rushed from the restaurant and sat talking without any worries from the staff.  In terms of drinks they were good but the melon mule wasn't as good this time...  In terms of parking there is ample public parking as well as valet should that be preferred. There is outside seating and sometime there are bands playing.",

    "text": "I have been to Dressler's several times over the years and always enjoy it. I love sitting outside on a warm night and seeing Charlotte's distant city view. We had dinner there yesterday (random Monday night) to use a Living Social deal that was about to expire. The deal provided 2 appetizers, 1 Salad, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert. I also ordered a Prosecco (to add to my other pre-drink @ Pisces while we waited for a table). Apparently many others in Charlotte were doing the same thing because we didn't make reservations and could not be seated until about 9PM.   In light of the deal above, my date and I ordered the following:  Shared Appetizers 1. Ahi Tuna - Excellent (a predictable, over-ordered restaurant appetizer -- but Dressler's did it justice!) - 4* 2. New Orleans Style Shrimp w/ Baguettes - better than Ahi - 5*  Salad (shared) 1.Tomato & Mozzarella - 5*  Entrees: 1. Filet w/ mashed potatoes & asparagus - 5* 2. \"Just for the Halibut\" (my date's favorite -- was sold out) so he ordered the NY Strip instead. IMHO, the NYS was not anywhere close to as good as my filet but it came with french fries so all things balance out. ;) A strong 4*  Dessert 1. We shared the chocolate cake with ice cream and it did not disappoint. 5*  We were so full and we both loved the meal. The waitress was great too. A great Monday night out in our beautiful Queen City. I have to say, however, Dressler's is a great choice with or without a deal. I am not sure they'll offer this deal again but will readily return.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "They were doing a charity dinner thing last night where a portion of your bill, if you ordered off a certain menu went to Second Harvest Food Back which was cool so we made reservations.  It was a gorgeous night and upon arrival I was excited to see that they had open table on their patio.  We were greeted promptly and whisked through to the outdoor seating.  What a gorgeous evening to sit outside.  The patio if you haven't been is perfect for people watching and they have these huge tilt umbrellas that do a great job of keeping the sun out of your eyes.  The Hickory Tavern is right next door with their patio and there is a nice open park / greenway which adds to the ambiance.  On this special menu was pretty much what I would order anyway except for the Halibut.  I started off with the spicy thai calamari which if there is ever a contest for the 'Best Appetizer in CLT\" I would say this would win, hands down.  Lightly fried strips of calamari tossed in a sweet, gingery, and spicy thai sauce.  Topped delicately with a spicy wasabi sauce that is absolutely the perfect compliment to this great app.  You are definitely missing out if you don't order this when you're there.  For the entree I had the Blackened Heart of Ribeye served with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The ribeye, which I ordered medium rare (as a good carnivore should) was the thickness of a fillet and VERY hard to cook perfectly if you don't know what you're doing was lacking.  It was overcooked on the outside and mushy in the middle, the blackening never really took because of the way the steak cooked and was more charred tasting than blackened.  Not my favorite dish.  The sides were just meh...potatoes were plentiful and sections of them were cold.  Asparagus was just that, asparagus on the grill and boring.  We ordered our desserts to go as to make the kids feel better that we dumped them at a sitters house.  I had the Chocolate cake and Sweetie the cheesecake.  Now I haven't mentioned the service which was fine to this point.  Since we were ordering the meal off the special menu we ordered all at once and told her that we would take our dessert to go.  She brought us the chocolate cake which was apparently served with ice cream and we didn't realize it.  We don't live uptown and didn't go straight home so when we arrived the ice cream had melted and we had a mess in our to go container.  I would have preferred to be told that there was ice cram in the box and we could have put it in one of the 500 thermally insulated bags Sweetie keeps in her vehicle for emergency trips to Trader Joes.  Oh well.  It was a nice night out and Dresslers was 3 stars tonight.  I may be back, I may not.",

    "text": "Visited Dressler's this week for the first time with my lady and used a pretty sweet coupon deal which got us 2 appetizers, a salad, two entrees, and a dessert for around sixty bucks. Naturally, we decided to add a bottle of wine to our dinner cause nothing says fancy like a whole bottle of wine to compliment your delicious meal :)  Our server Asa was amazing! He was very knowledgable and took the time to suggest dishes that would pair well together as well as breaking down the ingredients in each dish. Five stars for Asa alone!  First, the appetizers. We started off with the Thai Peanut Calamari and the Goat Cheese and Roasted Garlic. Personally, I loved the Calamari, and to be honest I've never been a big fan until I had Dressler's Thai Peanut version.  The Goat Cheese and Roasted Garlic spread however delicious was nothing to run home and tell mom about. My lady and I agreed that the dish failed to meet its mark because of the flimsy pitas.   The Chopped Salad. I'm going to keep this short and sweet for sake of the rest of my review. The champagne vinaigrette is seriously one of the best dressings I have ever had on a salad in my life! Get this salad. You won't be disappointed.  Now onto the entrees. I had the New York Strip and my lady had the Rack of Lamb. The New York Strip was absolutely delightful. Cooked to a perfect medium rare inside with a perfect sear on top..yummy! It was filling and delicious and the garlic butter and asparagus created a wonderful blend of tastes. Oh, and it came with house made fries if that wasn't enough and man those were fantastic. Perfectly cut and crunchy and great flavor..no need to smother them in ketchup.  Finally the dessert. the double chocolate cheese cake was excellent. Two chocolates blended together..sold!   Full and fully satisfied we will definitely be back. With or without the Groupon, Dressler's is a must visit spot!",

Their calamari is my second favorite in the entire city, and their desserts are to die for.  The fella and I used our Groupon last night and first had drinks at the bar.  I tried a couple of cocktails (for Yelp research purposes, of course) and both were inventive and delicious.  The fella got his usual dirty martini and was excited they carried Tito's Vodka.  For dinner, fella got the special - roasted duck with cherries on top and a side of Brussels sprouts with bacon and fingerling potatoes ($30).  I'm not sure he noticed how many times my fork wandered over to his plate, but delicious doesn't quite cover it.  I decided on the filet ($29), which was the first time I've tried their steak.  It came with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes, which were thick and fluffy at the same time.  The filet was good, but it had a mushroom sauce on top - I'm not a huge mushroom fan, and I should've asked them to leave it off because it gave the filet a comfort food/pot roast taste when I was looking for a rare, juicy meat taste.  Our waitress was attentive and personable, and I appreciated the manager coming over to check-in and thank us for stopping by.  You can't beat the view of uptown at night, and the atmosphere is fancy without being stuffy.",

I simply cannot say enough about how warm and friendly all of the staff here were to us, especially our fabulous waiter who was simply amazing!  The food was spectacular to say the least, but I will say for full disclosure that our girls are fairly sophisticated foodies (no, really!!) and Dressler's is not geared for children, per se....parents should use discretion of course but we are never afraid to take our girls to (as they put it) a \"fancy restaurant\".  To put a topper on our evening, our youngest daughter asked if she could meet the chef, and without hesitation our waiter went off to ask and immediately Chef came out to our table to introduce himself; our daughters were just giddy to receive such special treat!  Just like an infomercial, but wait...there's more!!  Chef followed up his gracious visit with sending out a special sampler desert each for our girls which was simply amazing!!  There is nothing I can type to express enough the amazing dining experience had at Dressler's and I certainly intend to return again to one of the finest restaurants in Charlotte!!!",

When it comes to celebration, Champagne is perfect starting point--especially if it's from a big bottle.  Large format Champagne is tough to come by in the Old North State, so I knew I'd stumbled across a gem when Jon Dressler granted my longstanding wish, helping me celebrate my birthday in style.  Tim Buchanan (the GM) does a great job with the wine list, and shared a fantastic late harvest chardonnay that was a memorable treat.  The restaurant itself is beautifully appointed.  It is divided into several dining rooms and a patio that both wrap around the first floor of the Metropolitan, providing a great view of the Uptown skyline.  Dark wood, heavy curtains and a deep red palette give the interior a modern, upscale feel.  Everything combines to create a trendy setting, while providing an intimate dining experience.  The dining room was bustling, but the layout made it feel like our party of 6 had the place to ourselves.  The food is excellent.  The menu includes an array of steak and seafood dishes with a Southern flair.  There are a lot of restaurants in the QC that attempt such menus, Dressler's delivers.  I had the filet, but my friends also enjoyed the pan seared trout, sauteed mahi and crispy duck entrees.  I highly recommend dessert, especially if the title features \"Mom's.\"  I'm told these desserts are from the secret archives of Mama Dressler herself.  Mom's Peanut Butter cheesecake was a fantastic finish to a great birthday dinner.",

    "text": "Let me just get to the point on this one! It was the bomb-diggity dot com!   My first telephone contact was with Stefan (restaurant manager) for reservations. He was quite polite and accommodating on the phone, when we arrived at the restaurant, and when he came over to check on us during the evening... way to go handsome Stefan! Me likey the attention!   This is our second visit, and our second go 'round with the warm crab dip appetizer. It's soooo delish, laced with quite a bit of blue crab, and topped with melted cheesy Parmesan goodness... yum! However, my eyes did wander over to notice a neighboring guests noshing on some rather delectable looking calamari... note to self to have the calamari on the next visit! My second course was a battle to choose between the Baby Arugula and the G's House salad. Alas, G's House won out and it was on the money, especially when ordered with extra apple slices. My entree of rack of lamb (4 chops) was served up succulent and moist, accompanied by the potatoes au gratin. My compliments went to the chef because my \"a little done with still some pink\" request came back perfect!   Wait service from Aloma was on point! She had great suggestions, offered truthful information when asked, had the right amount of conversation, and was quite attentive throughout our long overstay... Me and the bestie were dining, chatting, and keeping tabs on the SNF game via our cellies! Yes, cells out and in use, at the table of a fine dining establishment... whaaaat???  Seriously!  It's the playoffs!!!   The #1 Jets fan shared the crab dip, opted out of the green leafy stuff, and ordered the braised beef short rib with sour cream mashed 'taters. The generous portion of boneless beef was tender and covered with just the right amount of sauce. She was quite pleased with her meal and longed for seconds! Indeed, her meal was the perfect prelude to a victory over the Pats!  And the perfect set-up for my Steelers!  No room for dessert this time, as I had my carryout container with my 3 remaining chops in tow. But second note to self is to save room for Mom's apple cake (a la mode, of course), and/or the peanut butter cheesecake that I have been oblivious to, on the next visit to this Midtown gastronomical phenom!!!  Loves it!",

For the main course I had the famous halibut. It was good however the sauce was richer then I expected, would have enjoyed it more if I omitted the sauce or put it on the side. Desserts are amazing here, especially \"Mother's Desserts\". we had a sample of several desserts. The pumpkin cheese cake was such a hit we ordered more for the table! It was hands down the best pumpkin cheese cake I have ever had. Would visit again while in town and would recommend Dresslers to anyone visiting the area.",

    "text": "My fiance and I regularly visit this restaurant for anniversary and I always very happy with the service in quality of our food. I would say if you don't like a place to season your food this is not the place for you. This is not a bland food restaurant unless it's the vegetables which leave a little something to be desired but then again a lot of people don't like over season vegetables which you can always just spice up with a little salt and pepper. They have a small bar for the size of the restaurant and usually the bartender is a little icy but the restaurant is kind of upscale so I tend to expect that. You usually get the super friendly bubbly bartender at a bar that serves mediocre food or horrible food. I have seen reviews where people complained about their drinks not were filled quickly enough but I have never had my glass go further than half way without our waiter coming by and topping it off except for on one occasion. And no it is not Chris and Ruths or Del Frisco's if you love those restaurants but I have had some of the best steaks from this restaurant and I think that the steaks are only different from time to time because of where they were able to obtain the beef from. Which if you are beef connoisseur you know exactly what I'm talking about.",

To drink I had the pineapple basil smash amazing and delicious. For our app we shared the crab cake I love seafood and this was fresh and the best crab cake you will get being away from the coast in NC. For entree I had the halibut and my husband had the filet mignon both cooked perfectly and delicious. Very flavorful and seasoned just right. For dessert we had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake...this is heaven in your mouth. Just the perfect blend of pumpkin and creamy cheesecake. If they have it you have to get it you can not go wrong. I will definitely go again it is exceptional! The ambiance is very laid back on the weekday a lot of after work crowd and our server told us on warm evenings on Thursday and Friday there is live music. We can not wait to come back",

The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was my entree was a little bland I was hoping for a little more - but you know I didn't listen to the waitresses suggestions so maybe that was my bad.   The menu is filled with fresh fish, and steak options. I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers the calamari was some of the best I've ever had prepared Asian style with peanut sauce and wasabi I could have devoured the whole dish myself...next was the smoked salmon carpaccio I have been thinking about this dish ever since I left. Next time I just might eat the carpaccio as my meal.   My dad and sister had the lamb and they raved about it and my little sister ordered the Mahi Mahi there was nothing left on her plate and they do serve you a decent size plate here folks. The trout dish my step-mom and I ordered was a little disappointing needed some sauce or seasoning. I will definitely be back the atmosphere the staff and the food were all top notch. Really sad I didn't save room for dessert next time for sure.",

    "text": "Oh wow oh wow. I'm a big fan of Charlotte local eateries, but Dressler's takes the cake...the CHEESECAKE.   For days, I've been talking about Jon Dressler's mama's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. OMG it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. But I won't get ahead of myself, let's go through the digs and the meal first.   This new location is nestled into the upscale Midtown shopping center and is easy to find and to park. Inside, it's a nicely styled upscale restaurant, complete with comfy booths and a decent sized bar. There is also a nice patio, but it was hella hot, so we chose to dine indoors.   Our server was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly, offering suggestions and personal feedback on potential menu choice for all parties. I ordered the Tuna Seared to Perfection - a sizeable piece of sashimi grade tuna, you know it, seared to perfection over a tasty rice cake. The best part was, however, the insanely delicious peanut sauce that was drizzled over the tuna and the plate. It was just enough not to overpower the item.   Price wise, it's comparable to other upscale eateries, expect to pay roughly $20-$30 ish per entree, but it is worth it. Completely. All six of us ordered different menu items and adored them. Make sure you hear about the specials too, they sounded great.   And back to the cheesecake...it was peanut buttery goodness in one little slice of heaven. Creamy cheesecake with the right amount of peanut butter and the perfect number of chocolate chips, all set on the most delicious chocolate crust. They should seriously make it a menu item, as it was a dessert special the night I went. Jon Dressler made a call to his mother as we were making our way out, and let my mom and I pay compliments to her dessert handiwork. Not only was she extremely humble, but she was just as sweet as her creations.   I can't wait to go back to Dressler's for the fantastic food, great service, and, of course, the peanut butter cheesecake.",

    "text": "Big fan of Dressler's - especially for their desserts! So glad they have a midtown location now as I don't get up to Birkdale very often.   Dressler's is located in the Metropolitan so there is plenty of parking in the deck, and it's got a great spot as there is outdoor seating on a patio with a beautiful view of the city skyline as well as couches along the side of the restaurant to sit at and have drinks while listening to the live music that Metropolitan frequently has on nice summer nights.   There is a decent bar area inside with a crazy selection of wine, beer and liquor drinks. Be sure to make reservations if you want to have a sit down dinner on a weekend; it can get pretty busy. Service is always very good and the food is fabulous. I've had the crab cakes, Halibut, Mahi Mahi and Salmon - all were very good. And the calamari appetizer is a must. As was mentioned in other reviews, the homemade desserts are out of this world. The peanut butter cheesecake and chocolate cake were fantastic.   In the end, Dressler's is a little pricey but worth every penny. And a great place to meet with friends for some outdoor catching-up/drinking. And be sure to save room for dessert as it's worth every calorie!",

    "text": "Maybe it's just me but Dressler's didn't live up to the hype. Me and the boyfriend spent a date night here and while we've been wanting to come here for a while now, it was a really disappointing experience.   The good: We made a reservation so wait time wasn't bad at all. We sat outside and the view was as amazing as people have commented. There was a band playing outside so the intimacy was pretty much gone at that point but they were pretty good and made the ambience less \"stuffy\". The drinks weren't bad at all. If you're concerned about prices, don't get a cocktail and do a beer instead. Cocktails average around $13 but it was good nonetheless. We got a free dessert, the Apple crisp. The boyfriend loved it, I wasn't a fan but to no fault of the dessert. The best part of the meal was the appetizer. We got the Cajun scrimp and baguette and it was delicious- they should make this into an entree.   The bad: The entrees were just bad. The boyfriend got the New York strip steak with fries and asparagus and I ordered the ribeye with asparagus and herb potatoes. We also got the macaroni and cheese side dish. Both of our steaks were over cooked. I ordered my steak medium and the boyfriend requested medium to medium well. Worst steak I've ever had in my life. It was dry, too charred, and we didn't see any pink until the middle of the steaks. I've had better steaks off my George Foreman grill. I didn't finish my steak and the boyfriend didn't either and we always clean our plates. I literally had 3 asparagus spears on my plate. 3. I'm not sure why they would list asparagus to come with an entree if it's going to be a garnish. On the other hand, the boyfriend got a normal amount of asparagus. It was just like WTF. The macaroni was bad. It had basically no cheese and was not creamy. It got eaten because we were hungry. Our server was okay, just a little odd to me. He wasn't very accommodating and was very nonchalant. I could tell that he either had plans that night that he was missing out on or just didn't want to be working.    The ugly: Turn around time is horrendous! We ordered the appetizer and entree at the same time and we were left waiting what felt ages and it wasn't even busy. I was at the point of becoming hangry. We didn't send our steaks back because we didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes and it was getting too late for heavy foods. The food is most definitely overpriced for the poor quality.   Glad I came to say that I went but I will definitely not be returning.",

    "text": "Very solid. More upscale than another good local eatery, Beef 'N Bottle, but the service, location, and food is great. The portions here are pretty hearty and the service we get is helpful and knowledgeable. I ordered the lamb and then requested mint jelly on the side. Hopefully, the chef didn't get offended, but I must have that lamb/mint combo!  If you want to try on the cheap, look out for their LivingSocial deals, which I don't understand as it's already pretty popular.  Their desserts are mostly the \"mother's recipe\" which makes them have a more local feel. No fancy desserts here, but the key lime pie was a refreshing finish to a recent meal. It had the perfect cheesecake consistency.",

I highly recommend the \"blackened heart if the ribeye\". I typically prefer a filet and tried to order it, but our waiter talked me into the ribeye. It was easily the best steak I've ever eaten! We got the \"just for the halibut\" which was also recommended by our waiter. It melted in your mouth! My kids enjoyed the selection from the kids menu (which you need to ask about!) We also enjoyed the Crab Dip appetizer, the bacon Brussels sprouts and several of their dessert selections. Aside from wonderful food, the restaurant also has a wonderful staff and awesome views of Uptown Charlotte! Dressler's is an awesome place to have a nice dinner!",

My boyfriend and I were celebrating an anniversary and wanted to try somewhere new. I am so glad we tried Dresslers ! We made reservations and was able to easily get the time we wanted. The hostess was really nice and very personable. We were seated quickly and had a great view of downtown. The hostesses asked if we were celebrating anything special and brought out complimentary champagne which was a nice touch. The food was great we had the crab dip for appetizer and we both had the ribeye entree and the apple crisp for dessert. This is differently a must try restaurant !",

It's located in the Metropolitan area and we elected to eat outside on the patio since the weather was nice. We had an absolutely beautiful view of the skyline! Our server was really knowledgeable about the menu and even gave tips on how to maximize our use of the Groupon. He was in great spirits even though they were really busy. We started with the field greens salad and a couple of apps- the tenderloin and the ricotta dumplings. First of all, whatever sauce they had the dumplings sitting in was absolute HEAVEN. Perfection. The risotto that came with the tenderloin was really good too!! Both apps were winners. Then we moved on to main courses, I had the halibut and my bf had the ribeye. The halibut was deeeeeelish! Boyfriend absolutely loved the potato cake that the halibut came with. And the sauteed greens set it all the way off. He really enjoyed his ribeye too, but he was preoccupied eating my potato cake. Finally. Dessert. The most delectable cheesecake I've EVER tasted. In life. I honestly think this was the best meal in a restaurant that I've had the pleasure of eating in Charlotte. It was seriously that good. Definitely try this place. You won't be disappointed!!!",

That combined with my wife arriving late created as much as an hour gap.  No worries, the professional staff made the guest feel welcomed and relaxed as they mingled waiting for my wife.   As dinner began, perfection went to another level. The staff served our 21 guests with the same service as a private dinner for two.  Our guests kept asking what the appetizers were, because they were satisfied as if those could be an entree. After the salads, entrees arrived (ribeye, halibut, crab cakes). The flavor & presentation was perfection! All guests couldn't leave any on their plate.   We even had a guest that requested a Vegan dish (not on the menu), the chef delivered and our guest enjoyed the custom service.   Jon Dressler, Kent Voss, Brittany, MJ and the entire kitchen and bar staff made a lasting memory!",

Our server was wonderful and very attentive to my guest and I, and answered all our questions without any issues. Very efficient and prompt as well.   I had the blackened chicken pita for lunch with the pasta salad and my guest had their chicken salad with the pasta salad as well. The blackened chicken pita was delicious! Perfect amount of spice and seasonings, and the pita was light and fresh! As for the chicken salad, there was more than enough on the sandwich and half of it became a snack for later in the day. The pasta salad needed a little salt or seasoning, but that is really the only qualm (and such a minuscule one at that)   Only gave it four stars because I didn't try their deserts and I know nothing about their dinner menu, but I'll certainly be back to check that out!",

We made reservations for the first open table at 5pm and we were alone in the entire restaurant for approximately an hour. Our server was WADE he was amazingly upbeat and entertaining. We were greeted by a manager whom congratulated our anniversary and gave us complementary champagne. We were later greeted by another manager who checked in on us several times in a very personable (not annoying at all) way. Food: our appetizer was the crab dip. Some reviewers said it was a tad bland....I agree BUT I appreciate the amount and quality of lump crab. A TOUCH of salt goes a long way.  My husband had the blackened heart of ribeye with asparagus and potatoes fingerlings. It was amazing...like he was moaning after every fork full. I had the salmon over risotto, also amazing! For dessert I had the the Apple cake via the server recommendation. I wasn't really a fan but others seem to love it so we'll chalk that up to my fickle overly picky taste in sweet treats. My husband had the cheesecake and it was great. I even liked it despite not being a fan of cheesecake. If you like fluffier less dense cheesecakes then this one's for you. The scenery of our beautiful queen city skyline was amazing (especially since when dined during sunset) and the view can be seen almost anywhere in the restaurant. The ambiance is typical white table cloth fancy but guest attire ranged from casual to \"downtown night out\" dressy. Customer service was outstanding....honestly perfect experience from beginning to end.",

We made a reservation and were seated right away when we arrived even though they were very busy. Our server greeted us promptly and walked us through the menu. Appetizers we enjoyed the Goat Cheese, although the ratio of toast points to dipping sauce was way off. The seared ahi tuna was amazing and the Wasabi sauce provided the right vibrant kick to help with the fall sinuses. For dinner, Lamb Chops with Creamy mashed potatoes and  Halibut on a bed of  sauteed spinach and potato cake. Both were truly exceptional. The Lamb Chops has the right amount of char to activate the wonderful marrow flavor into the meat and of course the red wine reduction was a perfect compliment. The Halibut was perfectly cooked and flaky, and all components were plated with a nice ratio to provide a balanced bite every time.  The one fail of our Dressler culinary journey would have to be the Key Lime pie, or rather tart. The crust lacked flavor and the whipped cream lacked any really body. Although the filling was bright and crisp it was way to thin in comparison to the crust. The overall pie had a refrigerated stale taste that could not be overlooked.   Overall a fantastic experience with both food and service and we were not made to feel rushed, rather we felt like invited guests... I will look forward to this on my next trip home.",

The restaurant is large and has a variety of seating options, so it's great for everything from a romantic dinner for two to a private room dinner party.  Reservations are recommended, especially on a weekend, but it's usually not hard to get seated.  They are welcoming and sweet to children even though it's an adult atmosphere.  The menu is great but the waitstaff put this restaurant on another level.  If you want career waitstaff on par with the best restaurants in France, this is the place to go.  Highly recommended!!!!",

After two, I was buzzed and the drinks were smooth and strong! Thanks to this bartender and the delicious appetizers with an affordable price tag and living right across the street...

    "text": "Sad to say that my family and I did not enjoy ourselves during our lunch visit on Easter Sunday. I made a reservation for 5 people at 3pm to enjoy a late lunch with the family. They had a preset menu for the holiday, which allowed each person to select an appetizer, entree and dessert for $40/person. As we were ordering, we were told that they were out of 2 entree selections and 1 dessert options (later we were told an additional 2 desserts were unable after we already placed our order). For our waiter to say that the restaurant had not been overly busy so far and to be out of 5 items come 3pm, we were a little disappointed. We continued to make the most of it and selected from the remaining options and even ordered some cocktails, until I received my entree order. I ordered the Filet medium and when I received it, it was WELL DONE. Completely brown and dry both inside and out. The waiter offered to take it back and a new one would be out within a few short minutes, when I then noted for it to be more medium rare than medium. My family proceeded to eat their meals so they would not be cold by waiting, where I waited 20-25 minutes for a new dish. They finished before I received my new dish, when then they had to sit and wait for me to now eat alone. Keep in mind, the second Filet came out exactly like the first one, WELL DONE. I was so hungry at this point that I forced myself to eat it. Through our meal, we were not checked on or receiving refills on our drinks. When it came time for dessert, we could now only choose from chocolate cake and cheesecake. We were pretty disappointed that the carrot cake, apple cake and key lime cake were out, considering how early we felt it was. Overall, it was a dissatisfy experience that we received while trying to enjoy our Holiday. Nothing was addressed or compt, which we were not looking for, although the gesture would of been nice. I believe your service can win over a non-satisfying meal any day, and we did not receive either.",

    "text": "I usually really like Dresslers, so I hate to have to downgrade this review. For the most part it was good, but the fact that I ordered a medium Filet Mignon and it came to me over  well-done is unacceptable for this fine dining establishment. I let the waiter know and they re-made the steak this time it was med-rare, but I just sucked it up and ate it since my family was already almost done with their food. Now normally when something is sent back to the kitchen the manager brings it to you or at the very least comes by the table to apologize, well that didn't happen. Secondly, I ordered a Washington Apple to drink, which is Whisky, sour apple liqueur, and cranberry juice. The waiter took the order without issue, when I got my drink it was just whiskey and cranberry juice, so I asked him, where is the Apple? He then decided to tell me they don't carry the apple liqueur...ummm the name of the drink is called Washington Apple, sir!...so why wouldn't you say that at the time I asked for it, so then I had to order something else and wait for that,  no apology. I was really unhappy with this visit to Dresslers and I'm really not sure when I'll be returning. Oh by the way, This was NOT during restaurant week, not that it should matter, but sometimes service suffers a restaurants during that busy week, but this was not that week.",

    "text": "First time I came here I wasn't really impressed with the food, though the service was amazing. Thinking we might have just ordered the wrong things, I decided to give it another shot when a Groupon popped up. After giving it a second chance I can say with the upmost confidence... the food is just alright, service is still good, and that if I would have paid full price for the meal I would have walked out a tad pissed.  I will however start with the good. The staff is great. Starting with the hostess and ending with farewell at the door, a bunch of kind, helpful folks. Asa was our server and he was both personable and professional. A seemingly rare combination these days. While he did disappear at times, I walked away feeling like he was stellar at his job.  Now for the food. I must preface by saying that I will gladly drop money on really good food. Its one of the few things I enjoy spending it on, but I also look at opportunity costs. If I am going to spend $30 on an entree it should at least be better or more interesting than a similar dish I could have gotten somewhere else for $18. Obviously there are other factors that will justify cost, experience, ambience, you get the idea.   So far I've tried the calamari, goat cheese, crab dip, chopped salad, ribeye, halibut, new york strip, lamb, and chocolate cheesecake. All that and the only thing that impressed me was the dressing on the salad. A champagne vinaigrette that was truly amazing wasted on a combination of ingredients that you would find on a house salad at a place like Chili's. The calamari was good, fresh, but not memorable much like everything else. The goat cheese needed a better bread instead of pita, too limp. It just made me wish it was the goat cheese from 300 east, who do it similar and WAY better. The lamb was good, perfectly cooked but was dying for something fresh or green on the plate instead of just rich lamb, a rich sauce, and rich mashed potatoes. The steaks were good. However, without meaning to reference 300 east again, thought their hangar steak was miles better even with a cheaper cut and a cheaper price tag.   Bottom line is if you want to blow a bunch of money on decent food you won't be disappointed, the service is great after all. But there is much better food elsewhere at much better prices with an equally as engaging staff and ambience.",

As my mom said-the best salmon she has ever eaten at a restaurant (salmon snob, that one).  My dad's steak however, was waaay undercooked (he asked for medium and got two steps up from carpaccio), and also really lacking in flavor.  I typically go GA GA over the molten chocolate cake here, but it was overdone and solid all the way through.  Bummer for me!  I really hope it was because the restaurant was slammed and that Dresslers will be just as I left it the next time around.",

The service impeccable and we all had meals we loved.  We will make it a point to return.  Couldn't ask for anything more.

They did have Lobster tails and shrimp cocktail... neither of these are on the regular menu. We both got the crab cakes and they were awesome. The night before Valentine's Day they had the regular menu... my wife got the lamb and I opted for the tuna. Both dishes were absolutely fabulous and cooked perfectly. The service was great... except for the billing process. We sat at the table for over 30 minutes after we had finished our meal waiting for the check (after receiving a box for our leftovers) and then waiting more for them to return with the credit slit to sign. Thus, the 4 star rating for the excessive wait time after the meal. BTW: the manager and the waiter passed our table multiple times with the credit card in plain view and neither picked it up.

    "text": "Hello QC home cookin!!  I love local spots that break me away from my beloved chain restaurants.  Dresslers is that upscale local flavor that fits in perfectly in Midtown.    Inside is very classy and refined, while outside is picturesque and has views of the skyline.  It can get a little pricey when you include alcohol but such is the way of a worthy restaurant.  The entrees are rich and sized proportionally to what you should eat.  Not the \"american\" feed bag size platter.  It's just right.  My favorite dinner was the Shrimp and Lobster Linguini.  You will love it and the staff is very helpful if you have any questions about the menu.  Trust me, you will leave happy..  Enjoy -Ian M.",

    "text": "The crab dip appetizer was great,huge chunks of crab w/ sliced bread. My date ordered the crab cakes which she loved. I ordered the bay scallop dish which was terrible. It was Monday night so it was probably left over from the weekend., the rice was mushy and the sauce was stale is the best way to put it. 4 scallops for only $32 They were nice enough to ask how the meal was but I had already eaten alot of it so I didn't send it back. No side that's 6 or 8 dollars more, no salad with entree so it's a $45 a plate place. $30 a plate is fine w/ me, fifty is a little rough. The service was fantastic the female server did everything by the book can't say enough good things about the service. I'd go back on a special occasion and try another dish",

My husband and I order the crab dip which was amazing!! A must get. We also ordered the wedge also good, I got the Just for the halibut, fish was great, potato cake that comes with it not so much. My Husband got the seafood and grits with a tomato sauce, it was ok a little under season. Also Tim, the owner sent a carrot cake to the table after speaking to my hubby and it was divine!!! So great since I am a carrot cake expert.   Overall the food was delicious, the wait staff can't be beat and the atmosphere was great as well. I would definitely be back and recommend to a friend.",

It was good, but had a lot of wasabi on it.  If I had it to do over, I would have ordered it without that and I would have liked it better.  I had the crab cakes as my meal with a side of Mac and cheese.  The crab cakes were delicious, but you only get 2 fairly small ones.  I could easily handle three which seems a little more proportionate for a dinner. The Mac and cheese was good.  My girlfriend got the flounder special which she said was really good.  Add two cups of coffee and 20% tip and our meal was a little over $90.  I will definitely go back because there were several items on the menu that looked good.",

    "text": "My roomie and I went to Dresslers to grab a quick bite at the bar before a show. I asked the servers recommendation between two dinner plates and he said crab-cakes - but rather than let me simply order the $19 meal, he said you know we have an app portion and it's half off apps at the bar m-f! So I ended up getting that and the seared tuna and a delicious malbec all for $20- you really cannot beat that price!   And oh was he not kidding about the crab-cakes - almost zero filler and some of the best remoulade I've ever had! The tuna was cooked perfectly (but I felt it could use a tad bit of something- perhaps citrus?) Overall both dishes were very large for an appetizer portion and I was completely full after two.   Great service from the bartender, convenient locale, and we were in and out in a short period of time in order to make our show- so I will definitely return!",

    "text": "Good gluten free dining option if you are  menu savvy.  My husband and I dined here today for lunch.  We had a great overall experience.  We were seated promptly and our waitress was both speedy and friendly.  The restaurant does not offer a separate gluten free menu nor does it designate any menu items as gluten free.  Our waitress was not knowledgeable on the subject either.  So, if you have to maintain a gluten free diet you're on you own here.  My husband and I ordered the grilled chicken risotto.  It was DELICIOUS.  Loved it.  So good.  For dessert my husband tried the key lime pie.  He said it was good, not great, but good standard key lime pie.  I had the Creme Brulee (the only gluten free dessert option).  I was a little wary after having a bad creme brulee at Bernardin's, but as it was my only option I went for it.  The difference was night and day.  It was very good and I was happy with my choice.  One thing to look out for, the dining room is quite noisy.  My husband and I were able to converse but it was mildly challenging.  Overall a great dining experience we wouldn't hesitate to do again.",

    "text": "Went there on a Friday evening.  The atmosphere was exactly what I had hoped for which was not too stuffy although some patrons were taking the casual attire way too far.  We were promptly seated in a location I requested so we could people watch those next door at the Hickory Tavern. Our waiter was extremely nice and not overly pushy which is nice.  We shared some Buffalo shrimp as an appetizer which was fantastic.  Not really a complaint but don't you hate it when there are an odd number so the lat one sits in the dish because you're both being too nice!  I wish I had taken the darn thing! We went on to split a wedge salad which they split for us.  It was very fresh and the dressing was really nice. We both were in the mood for beef.  My date got the filet and I got the NY strip.  Both were cooked to perfection with lots of flavor.  My fries were perfect she enjoyed her sides of mashed potatos and asparagus. All of this with a nice bottle of Pinot. Although Dressler's is not cheap it should not hurt your feelings for what you get.  I will reserve the fifth star for my next visit which won't be long!",

So after 10-20 menus and suggestions I finally decided on Dressler's for my birthday dinner. It was the worst experience I think I have ever had. First after being sat we waited almost 5 full minutes before being greeted by a server. We had already decided on our appetizer and entrees but after taking our drink order he scurried away before we could even mention that we'd at least like to get the app in.  Then he brought our drinks and ran away again! Finally a different server who was obviously new to the business came and took our app order. We got the scallops which were pretty good, but it's hard to mess up a scallop. Then the entrees...AWFUL!  My fiance got short ribs or something similar which was average, and I got the Sea Bass. It was undercooked, cold, and completely flavorless. I took two bites and couldn't force even one more! I told my server and he looked at me like I was lying! Then with a full plate of disgusting food sitting in front of me he asked if I'd like to box it and enjoy a free dessert! WHAT?!  I said no thanks! In the end he did take my meal off of the bill but after spending almost 2 hours and $70 even after my meal was comped I had almost lost my will to celebrate! NEVER going back!",
