I bought tilefish today and was given an absolutely incredible recipe.  I also bought a few scallops to prepare as an appetizer.  Wow!  Dinner tonight was wonderful.  If you want REALLY fresh fish and instructions on how to prepare it, you must try this place.",

The fish is extremely fresh, the board behind the counter explains type, method caught and location.  This place is my new SUSHI supply and fish candy store!!!",

    "text": "- I purchased premium # 1 grade Yellowfin tuna and paid a premium price. $38.99 a pound which was fine.   a. Trying to use my groupon, I asked for a pound. After cutting the portions completely and showing me how nice it looked, the worker told me \"it would be a LITTLE BIT OVER\". This actually ended up being 1/2 pound over. Since there was a long line of people behind me and the worker was already calling into the kitchen to have someone come out and help with all the customers in line I just went with it. However that cost me an EXTRA $19.00 versus what I asked for.    b. To make matters worse although the tuna had great flavor, as we ate it there were lots and lots of scales in almost every mouthful so it made it almost impossible to eat.  c. 2 calls to the company including a voicemail I left on the owners line as well as 2 emails directly to the owner have not provided me any answers at all on this occurrence.   Summary: So after spending almost $60.00 out of pocket for poor quality and the portion bigger and therefore costing me more than I wanted to spend, I would not go back again unless my concerns are addressed and I certainly would not recommend it at this point.",

    "text": "Their product gets 5 stars and you definitely pay top dollar for it but it's great. Overall normal day service gets 2 stars as they are generally slow as hell. Today however gets 1 star.  0 or perhaps -1 if it were possible.  I drive here all the way from Huntersville and don't mind the drive or their prices because the seafood is fresh. But I always call ahead to make sure what I want is in cause its quite a haul. No different today. Been wanting to make some chowder so called ahead and reserved 2 dozen cherrystone clams. \"Do you have them? Yes, absolutely. Ok I'll see you in about 45 minutes.\" I get there, get ignored at the register for a few minutes and when finally helped. The woman looks at my order ticket, goes back to the back for 3 or 4 minutes and then comes back with an \"it will be a minute\". Ok. So my call ahead order isn't already ready. That sucks but I'll wait. Literally 10 minutes later, after they see me still standing by the register, one of the guys tells her to go back and \"do a count of the clams\". 3 minutes later she comes back and says something to the guy. Another 3 minutes go by and he goes to the back. Thank goodness he only took another 45 seconds to come back and tell me   \"we oversold and have zero clams\". No \"I'm sorry.\" just a \"well someone gave you bad information when you called\".  You have to be kidding me. As Seinfeld told the rental car company. \"You know how to TAKE the reservation you just don't know how to KEEP the reservation...   What would have been great service recovery?  \"I'm so sorry, how about a half dozen dry pack scallops on the house.\" Or, \"Here's 5 bucks for gas or something, anything...!  Even half an effort like that would have kept me loyal. Instead... It's been nice knowing you Clean Catch.",

They love special orders and never charge you for scrap cuts. Only the best portion of your order is what you are charged for.   It doesn't get better than this. Day old Alaskan Snow Crab legs, Blue Fin belly meat, Halibut collars, Monkfish cheeks, and the best crab cakes on earth.  Scallops to die for.  My biggest problem is that I haven't always prepared the food perfectly but that was my fault. The staff is always ready to help if you ask.  They are getting much better at having ready to go dishes and sauces but those are usually on the weekends to keep things at the peak of freshness I guess.  Been a customer for 2 years now and have started budgeting visits as a part of my monthly expenditures.  Pricey, but they have to be. Best around.",

While there is no doubt it is expensive the fresh flown in fish and seafood offerings are absolutely the best you can find in Charlotte!! They now have delivery service which is problematic for those of us that love what they have to offer and it's free for orders over $50.  One thing I really love is their daily email that gives you ideas of how to cook and prepare meals for your family in addition they have some preprepared items like fish tacos or seafood Wellington that are added components to your menu.  They are exceptionally friendly and prepare accessories with fresh items.  I have been a customer for about six months and this is a special treat for my family each and every week!!  Tonight we had sushi grade tuna burgers and shrimp pot sticks stuffed with fresh onion and it was remarkable.  Keep up the good work guys!",

While it's True that the prices are high, you are getting what you pay for in my opinion.  Follow them on Facebook because they are always posting a link to their blog.  They'll throw out ideas for recipes and what's arriving fresh that day.  I love skimming through it whenever I see a new post!  It's the best way to keep abreast of what's fresh off the boat.

Yes, you get what you pay for but I have to say as long as I am paying I may as well have someone else do all the work!

Granted it was Valentine's so my guess is they were busy as heck earlier in the day and had run out of most of the product.  When I walked in, no one acknowledged us and it wasn't clear where we should wait, so we sauntered to what kind of looked like a line.  People were just standing around and no one was offering to see if what they wanted was in stock or to even acknowledge their presence.  Most of those in line in front of us waiting for at least 10/15 minutes, only to be told they did not have what they were looking for.  Thankfully, we just needed some mussels, which they still had and were already cleaned and debearded (a HUGE convenience!).  Plus when we finally ate them, no sand!.  Also, you can text in an order ahead of time to come pick up (But you'll probably still have to wait).  Overall, it is a GREAT concept (sustainable, fresh fish!), and I am really glad this place exists.  I plan on coming back again, but they could really work on the customer service piece...a little more communication could go a long way.",

I hosted a seafood boil on Saturday and I can't say enough about the experience with Clean Catch. Bill from Clean Catch was wonderful from start to finish and the seafood was out of this world. I love seafood and I'm pretty sure that I've been ruined for buying it- ESPECIALLY SHRIMP- from anywhere else. We had shrimp, clams, crawfish, mussels and Andouille sausage-(Oh, my, the sausage was incredible.) Everything tasted and smelled so fresh and everyone thought everything was delicious. I had several people say that the shrimp was the best they'd ever had. It was so nice to buy clams and mussels and not have half of the shells cracked or damaged. I stopped buying shellfish here in CLT because so much of it had to be thrown out because of damaged shells! I thought the prices were very competitive especially considering the obvious quality of the fish.   So nice to (finally) have a great fish market in the Charlotte area!",

The few fish in the cooler are never labled. I know the difference between tuna and halbut, but some people may not. Also there is never a price listed. I dont mind paying 23.99 for the quality, but I shouldnt have to ask what everything is and also how much it is.

A bizarre practice is that they never have any prices on display by the fish, on the board, nor their mailing list and it is for a reason - people would just walk off with sticker shock the minute they walk through the door.   It is not rare to pay $35-$40 for a lbs of fish.  The fish is super fresh and they do bring hard-to-find items but be ready to pay up. This is one of the rare places where you will end up paying more cooking at home that if you were to go out to a restaurant.  This is a nice location so I imagine their rent is uber-expensitve. Still, if you don't feel like paying more for the piece of fish than your bottle of wine, you may want to try Whole Foods down the road (yes, it is cheaper).",

    "text": "To get this out of the way, i would like to reiterate common themes everyone else has said:  fresh fish, sustainable catches, wide range of seafood, great service, chefs on site, knowledgeable staff, they post their daily menus online, yadda yadda yadda, this place is great.  if I could deduct a 1/2 star for the prices, i would; be warned, it is a bit pricey, but i think that quality seafood is worth it  I always get my sushi fish here, they always have a variety.  This is also the only place I will get raw oysters from now on, as other markets typically dont bother knowing where theirs are from or when they were harvested.   All that aside, the #1 best thing about this place is that it is clean - looks clean, smells clean.  I have been to nearly every seafood market in charlotte, and they all smell and look terrible and generally look a little sketchy to be buying fresh fish from, even if it actually was good and fresh.  not only does Clean Catch carry a great product, but everything appears nice as well, so you're comfortable buying from them.  trust and peace of mind are very important when it comes to buying seafood (have one bad experience and you will agree with me ).",

To give you an idea, I bought a single filet of fish that weighed about a pound for over $30. I could understand if it was sushi grade tuna or something, but it was similar to a haddock! For that price, I can get haddock at a nice restaurant already prepared for me with a couple of sides. So, in a pinch, when feeding a small amount of people, I will be back, but no time soon.",

We've tried several different things here and have ALWAYS been impressed by the quality of their seafood, cleanliness of the store and the unparalleled service you get every single time you visit.  The seafood: We often get the fatty part of their faro island salmon and their sushi grade tuna to eat as straight sashimi. It's the freshest sushi you'll have in Charlotte. Beyond that, we'll get their crab cakes (PACKED with crab meat) and fresh oysters to grill/broil. We've seen folks order lobster Mac n cheese too...I definitely want to try that. They've also ordered uni (sea urchin) for us and most of the time, it's tastes really fresh. We've grilled and sauteed fish as well...delicious!  The service: Bill, Logan and Charlie are spectacular! The store can be packed, but they are so patient with you and treat you as if you're the only person there. They are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations. We live these guys!! They always offer you a bag of ice for the journey home.  It is pricey, but when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi...we want the best in terms of quality, freshness and cleanliness, and that's what you get here.",

    "text": "Here are things I enjoy in life: Seafood. Doing everything with more effort, expense, and panache than most people would. Cooking and entertaining.   As such, when the weather warmed up and it came time to bust open the barrel smoker on my deck and put together the first little cookout of summer, I had no other place in mind to find my delectable grillables than at clean catch.   With a shop that is always meticulously polished and lit with a comforting cleanliness and sterility, the moment you walk in the door of Clean Catch you realize you're a few steps above your average fishmonger.   As I stood, silently salivating, in front of the long crystal-clear glass of the central counter, I swooned. You can always count on Clean Catch to have certain fish staples, but the real charm of the shop is the exciting revolving nature of the more extraordinary sea-creatures that they get in fresh daily. On this particular occasion, I was faced with deciding between huge filets of dripping sunset-orange salmon, a giant blood-red block of sashimi grade Tuna that looked like the severed tongue of a golden oxen idol, a bowl full of huge rock shrimp, or a selection of the some of the largest scallops I've ever seen - seriously, these things were 3\" diameter.   Ultimately, I went for one of the fatter Salmon filets. The friendly fishmonger deftly and precisely sliced it into four even quarters for me, then abided my wishes for a pound each of the shrimp and scallops.   As he was parting, portioning and weighing my selection, my eye was drawn toward a little silver platter of purplish herbed patties at the far corner of the counter. \"What's going on here?\" I asked.   \"Oh, those are some Tuna burgers we put together,\" the handsome, slender sandy-blonde fellow cutting up my salmon replied.   I squinted, deliberated, and my cocked my head in such a way as to indicate I wanted to know more.   \"We just ground those up this morning. They're full of something something and taragon.\"   I was genuinely listening, it's just that the 'something something' was so exotic I didn't know what he was talking about. Didn't need to. I was sold.   With two of those burgers added to my order, I was ready to roll.   We skewered and grilled the shrimp and scallops, basted liberally with olive oil and lightly seasoned with sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. The shrimp were easily amongst the best I've had and I can't conceive of a scallop I've ever come across that was as rich, flaky, juicy, fully flavorful and meaty as the ones I got from Clean Catch on this day.   Half-full and wild from that simple first course, we then set upon the grill with cedar planks holding our salmon - encrusted lightly with ground pistachios, oil, and a little honey. Whilst those slowly smoked on the top rack, we tossed on those Tuna burgers.   Served up on a rye roll with just a little arugula, red onion, and a healthy smattering of Old Bay seasoned Mayo, those Tuna burgers crushed my tastebuds. From tongue to throat all the way down to belly then back up to my face and then out and all over all the way to my fingers and my toes I just tingled at the fishy flavor of that hot-seared, slightly raw tuna falling apart in my mouth.   Then, after a few drinks and the sun set behind the horizon, we turned on the party lights up in the pergola, tuned down the outdoor speakers, and fetched the cedar planks from the grill.   I didn't think my mouth had any moisture left to water, but that salmon drew from me every last drop. Fat pink flakes sliding off with each delicate wick of my fork, hot pistachio and honey dribbling down each bite, matching the smoked richness of the delicious fish. It all just worked.   I can't not go to Clean Catch for all my fishy needs now. I've been ruined for the Harris Teeter fish counter forever.",

If you are looking to dabble in making your own sushi, or want to keep it easy and just have some amazing take-home sashimi this is where you need to start.  Unless you are right next to the ocean, which isn't possible in Charlotte then this is the freshest place to get your fish.  Outside of their amazing raw selection (Oysters, fish, etc...) they also have a ton of other fresh items on the menu everyday.  I also recommend signing up for their newsletter so you get to see what's new everyday as well as awesome recipes.  Not sure you are getting the fish they promise at that chain-store, here you can see the whole fish so you know you are getting snapper when you want snapper!  :)",

    "text": "I was looking for a local fish market that would hopefully pull me away from regular grocery seafood counters and get me in front of some seafood I could actually say came from the sea and not some farm in who knows where.  I found Clean Catch through Yelp, searching for 'Fish Markets'. I can say I was not disappointed. When you walk in, the place delicately screams 'clean', 'simple', 'fresh'.  This is not where fish go to become placed in a plastic wrapped package, and to be sat out for lord knows how long, or frozen and tossed together in an air tight bag. This is where fish heaven must be right? Only the best are chosen daily to be brought to Clean Catch. Only the best are freshly cut to order in front of your eyes. Only the best fish get this treatment.  Clean Catch makes it easy for you, with their knowledgeable staff, picking out a fish or other sea creature is a sinch, and asking for cooking instructions is a breeze. They even offer freshly made pairings to make it easier for you to dress your fish or have a side dish.  As mentioned before the fish is pricey, but you get what you pay for! Quality service, and quality fish. I purchased two 7-8oz pieces of Halibut (aprox $34) and got cooking instructions from the employees. It was SOOOO GOOD. Flaky, moist, tender, melt in your mouth delicious. I will be back!  Side Note: Sign up for their email newsletter to find out what they will have daily in the case, and recipe ideas!",

The cheapest salmon they had was $20/lb but it was SOOO GOOD! and so fresh!  They even gave it to me in a bag on ice to keep it fresh on the ride home.  The guy was really nice and gave me some ideas on how to cook it.  I barely seasoned the salmon and it was literally the best thing ever.  My fiance hates fish b/c of the \"fishy\" taste and even without a lot of seasong, this didn't have the \"fishy\" taste.  he loved it!  They also had some interesting marinades but I didn't try them.  I understand that the fish has to be priced higher due to their high quality standards but I thought the price on the marinades was too high.  It was a very small amount of marinade and for the same price or higher as a bottle of marinade would cost in the store.    Regardless of these cons, I would definitely go back.  The fish was THAT delicious!  I will also note that you must cook it correctly for it to be delicious... and the crew at this place gives you lots of pointers if you just ask nicely.",

It was explained to me that the board represents all the product that they may have on any given day depending on availability.  On this day, the black grouper was calling my name, and the wife & I decided to get a crab cake to split with our fish.  They offered us some remoulade sauce for our crab cake and we took them up on the offer.  They also have instructions on how best to cook the crab cake.  Both the fish and crab cake were delicious once cooked at home.  I would like to think that I did a good job with both.  They definitely have the best fish that I have bought in Charlotte.

If you question that , stop in check it out then you will understand why it is worth it. I highly recommend it. Judge for yourself and try them out on a couple items. BTW, lobster roll fridays , everyday their crab cakes are awesome and the fresh fish selection is excellent.",

The lobster was great, I could definitely tell the lobster was fresh; I tried the Maine style, so the seasoning and preparation was very simple. But at $17.99 for a 6 inch roll (6 inches at the most), I thought that price was highway robbery. And yes, I understand lobster is expensive, but that price is outrageous. I tried it, but probably won't go back.",

Plenty of other options popping up all over the Charlotte area that procure the same quality seafood but charge 1/2 to 1/4 the price. Enjoy subsidizing these guys' lease with every pound of seafood you buy!",

It's a high end fish market that prices quality and freshness over all others, but also employs Chefs that make AMAZING dishes.  Price winning swordfish chili, seafood gumbo, crab cakes, lobster rolls, sushi.  It's much more than just a fish store.  My weekly trip usually includes a mixed platter of sashimi with some amazing imported ginger and another side of whatever looks good that day.  Just go in and ask whats the best, their recommendations will never steer you wrong.  Now some people will be turned off by the price, but it's hard to expect fresh, high quality, pole caught fish to be delivered each morning to a location in Charlotte without paying an up charge.  The store doesn't smell, it's super clean, its an overall much better experience with a better product than other fish markets in the area.",

    "text": "Clean Catch Fish Market is BY FAR the best fish market in Charlotte. They have the friendliest staff, and are always most helpful. Yes, they are pricey. The quality of the fish and seafood is well worth it, and not something you can get anywhere else in Charlotte. The market is meticulously clean, and it's awesome to see how the contents of the cases change continuously.  The fish comes literally from all over the world, and a lot of it was swimming in the ocean the day before it shows up in the Clean Catch case. They only accept the best fish, and I've heard a number of times of them rejecting shipment due to low quality. They truly care about delivering a high quality product and experience all around and it shows. There is an extremely wide range of fish, and they aggressively go after the best catches by season. I've found the most excellent smoked salmon at Clean Catch - ask for their private reserve rope hung smoked salmon; you'll be spoiled and never want another smoked salmon.  If you're a seafood lover - and I am - you will be in heaven. Oyster season brings and amazing selection of fresh oysters on a daily basis. Take them home and shuck away, or they will shuck them for you. Shrimp is always in the case, many different varieties and sizes throughout the year. Their fresh lobster meat is untouchable, shipped right from the docks so you can enjoy your own lobster rolls at home! Another one of my favorites, the Nantucket Bay Scallop, makes an appearance in the winter. These scallops are like little pearls of sweetness. Diver scallops are excellent as well; and the sea scallops are huge. All of their scallops are dry packed. Clams, mussels, soft shelled crabs, huge lobster tails, etc. - an incredible variety of goodness.  They also employ chefs, who create great in house specialties on a daily basis. Some of the best I've had: Oysters Rockefeller, Ahi Tuna Burgers, Salmon Burgers, an outstanding Vietnamese Caramel Salmon kit, lots of delicious sauces, I could go on and on. :) Their crab cakes are the best, almost solid crab with very little binder. Chowders and gumbo are excellent - they're always trying something new.  Highly recommended if you care about the freshness and quality of the fish and seafood you're eating - Clean Catch is the top. You can also join their daily mailer (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvisitor.r20.constantcontact.com%2Fmanage%2Foptin%2Fea%3Fv%3D001gChwixbboZaWig3Q3C1nxg%253D%253D&s=9f0b0cf7f8fd5ee65cd6725db1f0677c548767ec5061f37f278c2e5afb413b0a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">visitor.r20.constantcont...</a>), which provides a list of what's in the case for the day and also great recipes for the catch. As they say: Respect the fish.",

Not many restaurants can top what you can cook at home from here, as long as your cooking skills = \"can heat it up\"  Is it expensive?  Yes.  But speaking as someone who has flown a salmon from Alaska to Charlotte (I still shudder at that one), carried a bag of live lobsters on an airplane from Maine, and checked 15lbs of fresh Cobia fillets in my suitcase (apologies to others who checked bags on that flight from Florida, I thought I sealed better), it's not that expensive.    Clean Catch doesn't compete with the frozen shrimp that were raised in a pond in China thick enough to walk across or leftover squid from charter boat bait boxes that have been frozen 2 or 3 times and are sold in grocery stores, it competes with catching it yourself and getting it to Charlotte.  You can sign up for an immensely readable daily email of what is in the case and what to do with it, and you get great service in the store.  That's the kind of small business I support - one who serves a specific customer, and does it exceedingly well.",

You can park in the back and they have an entrance from the street and from the back parking lot. You pick.   When we entered, we were greeted by two guys, who I assume are the owners. They were very friendly and busy! It didn't look like they were fully open, since their wine racks were half full and their menu wasn't filled in, but there were already a few customers ordering.   I enjoyed the specialty store feel and the one-on-one service. I didn't buy anything since I was just walking along and didn't have my purse; however, one of these days I'll plan on getting something here.

Clean Catch is my new go to fish market.  I fully support the line caught method of providing fresh seafood, rather than a giant indiscriminate net.    The freshness and choices of their seafood is making my inner chef whirl through recipes I'll be making as the summer tumbles along.  I also see a Cioppino not too far in the future, since all the sea products for that dish are practically at my door!

I'm not a fan of the huge board listing all the fish with NO prices indicated.  The fish in the display isn't labeled either.  Granted, i mostly know what i'm looking at but it's nice to not feel like an idiot when looking at random pieces of fish.   The service is also just weird... it's not a super welcoming place.  I didn't find anyone particularly rude... just not overly friendly either. The $50/lb bay scallops i purchased were great and i'm sure the rest of their fish is good as well.

Bill wanted me to sit with him discussing how and why this fish showed up; however,  for me, there should be NO MARKET of support for the highly threatened fish EVER for any reason.  I haven't been back and buy all seafood from either the dock of the Florida marina as the boats come in or from Whole Foods.  The ocean's health and its inhabitants come first in our household.",

I sought a Charlotte fresh fish supplier for home cooks and I believe I've found it here.  The shop is clean and attractive, staff members are friendly and helpful, the fish looks fresh, and the three items I purchased were outstanding!  I will definitely return and I look forward to trying their fresh-made sushi too!",

    "text": "Yea, it's pricey. There is no getting around that. Is it worth it? Absolutely.   For a special occasion birthday meal, I cooked some scallops for The Lady and I, and I wanted good quality. Most scallops are previously frozen and shipped and not able to get a good sear on them, and they're also smaller. I called Clean Catch after seeing that they have scallops online and they said that they'll have U8s (WHAT) flown in from MA today and they'll be dry packed (*angel sounds*)...at $50/lb.  That sounds extraordinarily pricey. But. You only need 2 to make a meal with that.  The store itself is clean and doesn't have a strong smell at all, which shows quality. There's a big wine selection and a couple of artisan snacks and assorted goodies (like black and white pasta?), but the seafood selection is front and center. They are obviously proud of the fish they have, and you can even *see it* through the windows. I got two scallops, they offered ice (yes please. great service) and packaged it up. My total? $13 for the best damn scallops I've ever had/cooked. Fantastic. In fact, I probably didn't have to cook them at all, but seared scallops are just too good to pass up.   I won't be shopping here often, but I do want to return to try some of their pre-made/assembled creations. They've earned my trust and my business. It also doesn't hurt that they're located next to Petite Phillipe... :)",

They also give you so much meat over stuffing which was great. Luckily, my friends got them on sale because I saw they're originally $17 a cake and that's a lot. I would suggest considering to lower just a little, especially for the frozen day before ones. Either way, great quality and hope to head over there one day to grab some more.",

Most selections are sushi grade, they indicate where the fish was caught and the staff are passionate and knowledgeable about their trade.   Ask them to slice up some fish for a crudo appetizer. They'll even give you some special salts and sauces and tips of preparations.   Running a couple errands prior to going home?  They'll gladly pack everything on crushed ice for you.

Almost everything they offer is sushi grade - as in, you could eat it straight from the bag. We usually give it a good sear first, though. ;)   The store is always spotlessly clean and NEVER smells like fish. (A good thing as a fish smell means the product is rotting.) The staff behind the counter are always very knowledgeable and friendly, making suggestions for the indecisive customers like me.   While everything is good, my favorites include the monster scallops, tuna, crab cake and salmon burger. I wish I had a bank account large enough to try the arctic char!",

Bill and Cain and the rest of the staff are attentive to your preferences, honest about how things taste and recommend amazing ways to cook their daily fish.  I am a fish lover and look forward to their creations and daily deliveries.   Recently I have tried their Tuna Tartare, Tuna Meatballs, Shrimp Enchilades, and so much more, all of which I love. And, I cannot forget to mention their homemade dumplings, from the Dumpling Gang.  A few different varieties but are all amazing.

The sashimi grade fish is on par or better than some of the most expensive sushi restaurants in NYC and LA.  The menu is constantly changing so it's best to get on their email list and get daily updates.  We've had Toothfish from Antartica and Triggerfish from right off the NC coast.   Every time we make a purchase, the chefs talk to us about our ideas on sauces and how to prepare the fish.  We used to shy away from cooking fish, but with their help and simple digital meat thermometer we've created some amazing dishes.  It's a fun way to spend a weekend night and although it's expensive, you're still getting far cheaper fish than a nice seafood restaurant and much bigger portions.    For those that don't want to cook at all, they offer soups, pre-made crab cakes, fish kits (all you have to do is heat fish and put their sauce on it), oysters, and more.  You can have them shuck the oysters right there for you if you'd like to eat them in the store, same thing with sashimi cuts.  Highly recommended.",
