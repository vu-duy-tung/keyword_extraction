Bryan introduced me to it as one of the few pizza establishments in our Park Road/Archdale subdivision that delivers!  AND IT IS GOOD!  When you are craving NY style pizza, the fact that with one phone call it comes to your door within 30 minutes, hot and greasy (just as NY Style pizza does)......is pure amazingness.  I've only tried the pizza b/c I can't get past that.  Only down side (hence the four stars) is that they are closed on Sunday and that seems to be the day that I crave it the most (damn Chick-Fil-A syndrome!)  .....lol....seriously, if you're in the neighborhood, don't be afraid to pop in and grab a slice.  It is GOOD.",

I had a meatball sub & my husband had the chicken parmigiana sub- both were excellent.  12\" subs with fries for a very reasonable price. We wrapped 1/2 of each sub to take with us, but splurged on dessert- tiramisu and cannoli. Again, fantastic! The staff was extremely busy, but not too busy to check on us to be sure everything was ok. If in Charlotte again, New York Pizza will be my 1st stop",

    "text": "I went to a pizza place and got a sub... I know, I know....  I literally drive by this place twice a day and have never noticed it.  It is in a shopping center at the intersection of Archdale and South Blvd.  I work close by and some coworkers had gotten takeout pizza before and it smelled delicious.  Since I am southern by birth and have no frame of reference for New Yawk style pizza, I am assuming based on the oooh's aaah's and regular visits of our resident Lawng Islandah that this is the real deal.  If huge, greasy slices are what New York pizza is, then this place fits the bill.  It did smell delicious, but I declined that day.  Everyone seemed happy and full (although a few came by my desk asking for Shout wipes and Tums - I guess we are all accustomed to chain delivery places).  A lil grease in moderation never killed anyone though, eh?  Today a group of 8 of us ventured over there for lunch.  We arrived right around noon and the place wasn't packed, but they were relatively steady with people who seemed to be regulars (that's a good sign).  You order at the register and then wait for your food.  With 8 separate orders, we should have known this was going to be a bit of a cluster, but we all enjoy the company of the others, so it's all good.    The pizza slices came out immediately.  Huge slices, layer of grease on top... they all looked and smelled delicious.  The pizza peeps were happy and we told them to eat and not wait on us.  And then the wait began...  I ordered a meatball parm sub and a drink ($10).  The girl who ordered behind me ordered the same thing.  The girl behind her ordered a calzone. 2 ham and cheese subs after that.   I honestly couldn't see behind the counter when they were making the sammiches, so I am not totally sure what happened to the orders after me.  The pizza slices were on the table quickly, 1 of the 2 ham and cheese's came out.  Several minutes later my meatball sub.  Many minutes later (10-15?) the pizza folks were done, I had started on my meatball sub and fries, and we were still waiting on the calzone (which could have been made fresh, which would explain the wait), a meatball sub and a ham and cheese sub.  Someone from the table got up to check... another 5 minutes... here comes the meatball and the calzone.  Finally our lone remaining order of a ham and cheese sub, who luckily is the most patient and wonderful of the group, asked for his sandwich to be put in a to-go box as we had been there for almost an hour by then.  With 8 people all at the same time, and all ordering separately, the timing of the orders really can't be judged, but 30 minutes for a ham and cheese sub is a lil nuts.  And to have two of the same order, ordered back-to-back, that were spaced at least 15 minutes apart, that was a little odd too.   The food was quite good.  The sub was a standard meatball sub covered in cheese, but the fries are AMAZING.  Double fried or something to make them extra crispy, but oh so delish (extra blockage, hooray!).  The calzone, when it finally got to the table, was huge and served with marinara.  I didn't hear any complaints from the rest of my group and the portions of the sandwiches were large enough that most had lunch and then got a to-go box with the other half for another meal.    Good restaurant for a \"slice and a Coke\" (my only frame of reference for ordering pizza in NYC is an episode of Sex and the City), my only suggestion would be that if going in a large group, stick to slices so everyone is eating around the same time.",

We ordered buffalo wings and a large pizza with 1/2 cheese and 1/2 pepperoni and banana peppers. The pizza came out first. The crust was a slightly thicker than I find at other NY style places but this made it nice and crispy and it held up, so if you like your pizza loaded this crust can handle. The cheese was fresh and full of flavor, sauce was perfectly seasoned and not overly sweet and a good ratio of sauce to cheese. While the pizza was excellent hot and fresh from the over, I enjoyed it even more after it sat in the fridge at home. The wings came out next, they were super hot and smothered in spicy buffalo sauce. They were cooked to perfection, nice and crispy even with the sauce all over it. I would recommend checking this place out for sure, they had a good menu variety with sandwiches, calzones and Italian dishes so there is something for everybody. I have a chicken parm or meatball sub in my future!",

It's very unassuming as it sits in a strip mall but go in, and you know its going to be legit.   They have a pretty extensive menu too, past just pizza's they have wings (that we'd like to try), entrees, and desserts. Other than just their regular slices, they have this one called a \"Stuffed Slice\" and seriously, one slice is enough for a family! Its stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, and bacon and its a meat lovers dream.   My only downfall with this place is they clearly get a lot of delivery or pick up calls or something because when we go in, we definitely find ourselves waiting for a pretty decent amount of time before we get our food. Also, they're closed on Sundays, which is just ridiculous for a pizza place, but, it is what it is. If you're looking for New York style pizza, come here.",

    "text": "Have to agree with other folks here. It's a hint towards great NY pizza, or perhaps another style of NY Pizza that I've yet to experience. Regardless, I'm a fan. It was pouring, bitter cold, I had been sick all day, and I wanted some effing pizza for dinner. These guys were awesome. Can't comment on dining at their home base on South Blvd, but the delivery, as was the product, was fan-freaking-tastic.   Simple ordering. They deliver in a 5-mile radius from the shop. We're just in at 4.7mi. Score!   We were quoted about an hour due to the weather and every other soul in Crown Town ordering pizza at that exact moment. However, our delivery guy showed up in about 40 minutes. Bless his heart, man. He was a trooper. Super nice guy, too.  Went with the 18\" (more like 18') white pizza -- add spinach AND tomatoes. You apparently get either/or. Also scored a slice of their stuffed pizza. First, the stuffed slice. Stuff is awesome. Manageable to pick up and eat like a normal slice, but fork and knife made it easier for dunking into the marinara. The marinara was a little watery for my liking, but not a deal-breaker. I inhaled it. Not just because it was the only thing I had eaten all day, either.   The white pizza. Goodness gracious, it didn't even fit in the box! It was massive. Each of us ate one slice and called it quits. Had we some friends over it would have been gone, no doubt. Good luck tackling this monster with just two. The flavors were great. A little overzealous with the ricotta, but the garlic flavor was nice. I'd order it again, but not in the 18\" variety.   I'm a fan. I'd definitely count on these guys for trusty delivery yet again, but look forward to dining in house with a nice, foldable slice of cheese or pepperoni!",

I was craving some pizza and wanted to step out of the big chain places so off to New York Pizza I went. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. But I was able to order in no time, just one pepperoni slice....and it was less than $3 so that's a win.  The inside is quaint. It's a couple of table and chairs, booths, tvs...nothing fancy.  My pizza actually came up pretty quickly and I was out the door in no time!   The pizza crust was good, there were plenty of pepperonis, cheese...and of course grease! The sauce had a little kick to it, but it was not overwhelming and I liked it. I agree with Ben G, it's a different \"kind\" of NY style pizza...but still very tasty!   I look forward to trying their wings and fries and subs, when I was waiting for my order someone had ordered the philly cheese and it looked delicious!",

It's  probably my favorite. I'm no connoisseur but   I definitely know a thing or two about good pizza. We ordered a large pizza that was half pepperoni and half spinach.     Once we opened the box , I was mesmerized. It was so neat and the toppings were abundant and evenly distributed. The pizza was also delicious! It was nice and cheesy just the way I like. The crust was also just the right thickness for maximum foldability.       They do New York style pizza right. I was not expecting that from this little pizzeria in South Carolina. If I didn't live 1000 miles away I would definitely come more often.",

Being in town for 1 night in a hotel with no car, and reading the great reviews on yelp I thought for sure I'd have a knockout meal that'd be delivered to my door. Boy, was I disappointed. Try as I might I just couldn't enjoy much of this meal.   I wanted to try a bit of everything so I ordered a regular slice, a stuffed slice, a side salad and some buffalo wings. Here are the pros/cons of this meal:  PROS: - friendly service, from the person taking the order to the delivery guy - quoted delivery time was met (45-1hr), delivery guy even gave me a ring to give me a heads up he was about to arrive - salad was good and fresh - portion sizes definitely match the price, the slices are BIG, toppings were plentiful  CONS: - wings were a bit overcooked and tough - the stuffed slice was dry, almost like a pressed panini - holy salt lick batman, both slices were so incredibly salty that my mouth and tongue were left numb. You can barely taste the toppings, especially in the stuffed slice which probably had an entire shakers worth of salt in it by the taste.   Maybe it's much much much better if you dine in, I can only hope so. But based on my experience, once is enough for me.",

The crust has a good chew, the cheese had a good stretch, and the sauce was decent (not quite sweet enough for me). If you are a fan of NY style pizza, you should definitely come here for a slice. They also sell personal pies and larger pies for 2 or more. They don't always sell pizza by the slice, so pay attention to the times listed on the menu. Their Sicilian pizza is magnifico! The crust is heaven (light and airy) and it has a good amount of cheesy goodness. It takes about 10 minutes for them to cook the pies/slices so it can certainly be a quick meal if you are on the go. They also sell salads, pasta, and subs, but, come on, if you are coming in for a bite, definitely grab a slice or two.",

I might return and try other stuff if on this side of town. Giving 2 less stars for pricing $ needs to b $$ instead and salty pizza.  Tony's pizza still tops!!!",

I bought a a 14' plain chees pie, some buffalo wings and a 2 liter bottle of coke and paid $14 for it.  The food was good and so was the price.  Thanks to the yelpers for pointing this one out!!",

    "text": "Make it 3 1/2 stars.  If you want NY style pizza that's exactly what you get. Not that real NY pizza is the best mind you (far from it) but it makes for great comfort food. And this one is not tasteless like \"Tony of Charlotte\"s pizza. Hey Tony NY called and they want their subway map back, you fake!  I had a slice of Sicilian with extra cheese the first time (Yes!) and a plain slice the second time. If you saw the pizza that Trump shared with Palin this is it. It tastes exactly like the pizzeria from across the street back when I lived in New Yawk, at least before the Greeks took over and ruined it. Plenty of cheese (extra would be an overkill) good sauce and a huge slice for $2.45.   No, it's not crispy! NY style  pizza NEVER is -other than Frankie's in Miami, I don't know how they do it.  Not even Ray's Pizza* was crisp. NY style is rich, gooey and runny. And you tap a paper napkin on it to absorb some of grease so it doesn't run all over your chin. This is not fine food, it's pig-out comfort food. I've long outgrown this stuff. For dinner it's crispy, thin crust brick (open) oven or nothing but a slice for lunch ... hits the spot like the good old days.  Wanna know what's not authentic about this joint? No freaking way that you'd have to wait for a simple slice in NYC, especially not ten minutes like you do here. Are you kidding me?  I haven't tried any of their toppings and honestly they didn't look too famous, I'd stick to the plain slice or the Sicilian w/extra cheese.  *  Ray's pizza became famous in the seventies, there was only one location and it was called just  Ray's Pizza - the night shift cabbies stopped there at 2 -3 am, that's how the word spread around. All these \"Originals Ray's\", Famous Ray's are just copycats. A thanks to Mike S.  for reminding me!",

The menu is mostly your basic NY style pizza, subs and some pasta. The only one chicken choice is chicken parmigiana, other then chicken wings. Go here with the knowledge that the menu match's the name.   If you live in the area, your lucky they do delivery!   So yeah, guess what I ordered? A pizza and a sub. Plain cheese pizza was good. The meatball parm sub was very photogenic. (I am really getting into this whole food porn thing, I need to start taking more photos) If you like cheese and meatballs you need to order one a dee's suckers.   I might have given them three stars because the pizza crust was too chewy (too much chew, not enough crisp crunch for me) and very skimpy on the sauce. The sub was really loaded down with cheese like a heart attack waiting. Service was good and they seem to be Yankee fans so I will go back to try other items but since their name says \"NY pizza\" I needed to get that one squared away.  IMO, my favorite is some tough competion but four stars says\" Yay! I'm a fan.",

    "text": "This is my pizza place. I eat here at least twice a month. The prices are great and the pizza slices are giant. I get the plain cheese pizza and am happy eating just one slice. I ordered the entire pizza once and it was great too, however, I expected it to be as large as the slice of pizza, but it was not. I still go there a lot because it is so easy to eat there. Pull up, generally a spot in front of the door, despite being busy, walk in, order. The staff is always friendly and inviting. The pizza order does not take long and there is plenty of room to sit. But I generally like to take my slice home.   They recently changed their name due to not being confused with other pizza joints with the same name. That does not change a thing for me. I am a fan and I cannot see anyone not liking this place. Well, unless you do not like their thin crust. But that can be solved by ordering the thick-style pizza crust.  In addition to pizza, this place has also desserts, sandwiches, pasta and other things. I tried their wings once at a party and they were great! This place also delivers! I cannot stop raving about this place.",

Their name is New York Pizza. A lot of places say that and according to people I know from New York, only a few of them actually qualify. This is one of them. Here's the thing, though. That's not my favorite thing to get here. Don't get me wrong their pizza is delicious, but I absolutely love their garlic knots! Not the bread, the knots. I don't know what they do to these things, but they're heaven on Earth. Just the right amount of fluff and crisp. Perfectly seasoned. Great complement to the marinara sauce you get with it. Just yum!  I've never been disappointed. Quick wait times both if you call in before or order once you're there. Consistently delicious food (I usually get a calzone or the penne Alfredo pasta with chicken and broccoli.) with friendly service. They even deliver, if you don't feel like driving. So glad to be acquainted with New York Pizza!",

I would not say it is world-class pizza, but it is head and tail better then the next closest offering.   The NY pizza is thin and bendy as it needs to be.   The Thick Sicilian is properly thick, and will filled up your stomach with delicious carbs. The crust is just normal flavored.   Double check the prices before you order, as what is listed on Yelp does not match up at all.  I can't wait to try their subs as I am hearing very good things.",

The last time I ate here I wasn't impressed with the pizza, but my daughter and I fought over their garlic knots.  Anyone who describes this pizza as New York style must from the most rural parts of the state. It's just way too crispy to be NY style. Maybe this should be Charlotte style pizza. I was starving, so I ate both slices I ordered. What can I say, I love pizza so I'm going to make the best of what's put in front of me.   The garlic knots were better than the pizza. They were pretty large and fluffy, more like a small dinner roll size than a knot. It wasn't the way I remembered, but it was good.  I'm happy for those that are satisfied with this place- but when it comes to NY style slices, they miss the target.",

Beware thou... they do not sell slices on Friday nights or the weekend. But they do pack an absolute punch when it comes to small dinners. They have 4 or 5 variety's of small Italian dinners for under $5.50. I often grab the lasagna with tomato sauce ( which comes with garlicky bread), but the mancotti, stuffed shells and meatballs are all delicious.   This little joint is a hidden gem... it usually has at least half of the tables filled and a bubbly personality at the counter to help with orders.   Sicilian Slice is decent... very decent... best I have found in Charlotte - its definitely worth the try and if your in the south Charlotte area and considering it... try it.

Two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for about $4.60. I paid an extra .50 cents for each slice to add toppings to it. I got ham and beef. They don't skimp on the toppings so it's worth it! I couldn't help but also get the sicilian slice with pepperoni. Pepperoni had a good spice to it. Sicilian slice was fluffy and thick. Two regular slices were huge. I could only finish one slice.

Well, let me tell you, I ordered delivery of their spaghetti with meat sauce, side salad and garlic knots for the first time and all were amazing. Yes, 500 Degrees delivers their own food.   Spaghetti with meat sauce -- Not sure what their secret is but the sauce did not \"suck into\" the pasta and become dry. The meat sauce has an amazing consistency so that it remains separate from the pasta and is even better the next day. No additional seasoning is needed (unless you want super spicy or seasoned) and delivered hot to my door.   Side salad -- The basic side salad was huge and fresh (though the tomatoes were a bit mealy and expected this time of year). Very basic with black olives, romaine lettuce and a few other things. Can't be picky about tomatoes in March.   Garlic Knots -- Oh my gosh. These creations are amazing and I placed leftover knots in the freezer for future use (which I have). The order also came with really wonderful italian bread which is in the freezer along with the garlic knots. There has to be a secret recipe because these things are amazing and reheat perfectly well.  All told, I had three meals from one order and had to cook additional pasta to consume all the sauce. Never has happened before and much appreciated. I usually receive too much pasta and not enough sauce and arrives dry to my door.   Yes, I will be ordering again soon. Fabulous comfort food. Don't change a thing.",

I order my patties with mozzarella cheese sometimes I add pepperoni. Super delicious ! Overall the place is clean with a friendly staff. They have great lunch specials as well. I Recommend this place to anyone from jersey or NYC if you want that great pizza taste from home",

It can get a little pricey when you start adding toppings and what not, but the portions are pretty large.   They also have the BEST garlic knots. I'm not kidding, there's no place that I've had them where they compare to here.",

    "text": "Whenever I think of NY Pizza, I think of tiny, hole-in-the-wall places that have been slinging slices for decades.  It also doesn't help that the NY Pizza I was used to in college came from this tiny place where you could barely walk through (one shoulder's width) wide for customers, but you would grab a slice and enjoy it (all techniques welcome: the fold, plate hold, tiny bites (to keep from burning the roof of your mouth), etc).    This New York Pizza is located off of South Blvd.... plenty of places to park and it pretty clean and impressive inside.  I think the first thing that struck me were the TV's (maybe cause they were new), but you order at the counter and the pizza's come out to you, nice and hot.  Folks working here were nice and there was a steady stream of customers coming in (great sign).  We dinned in, but it looked like a lot of people called in and picked up... Not sure if they deliver... but I believe I live too far away from here to take advantage of that if they did.  Our group of 6/7 people split a salad and two pies.  Both were pretty darn amazing.  One was a pepperoni, banana pepper, and onion and the other was a sausage and mushroom pizza.  Solid crust - definitely key in delivering the toppings, sauces, and cheeses.  Looks like they also have calzones, pizza by the slice (pepperoni, cheese, some specialty), grinders, and some other items not pizza.",

Quality has been good, however there have been times when the product was undercooked.  Given a 500 degree oven should allow for a crispness, or well-doneness, but this has not been the case. Tonight I was told it would be an hour before the delivery came. That's fine. I'm ok with the wait. When the pizza came, it was not underdone, it wasn't even close to being done. I called back and explained the issue and was told that it would \"be an hour... uh uh, it will be there sooner.\" I was also told to keep the pizza for the delivery driver to take back.  So we didn't eat for an additional hour and 15 minutes while we waited for the remake. It took longer to get the recook than it did the original pie! I called back and told the manager that I didn't want the remade pizza, I just wanted my money back. I was then told that he \"couldn't do this per the owner\". Are you kidding me? Customer service was horrendous. Food was less than good, and I just now got my second pie. Guess what all, it's still underwhelming.  Sorry 500 degrease, your NY style pizza fell flat. Your customer service however fit right in with NY!  I'd love to hear from someone about this issue. Hoping that happens.",

Never have I had to do that and said I'd pay when I pick up. 30 minutes later I arrive and the cashier takes my money without confirming the order. It was wrong. They seemed surprised that it was wrong when there were pie slices when I never asked for any. It took another 30 minutes for them to fix the order....and the manager insisted I pay more to make up for their error. Quality of food was just \"ok\". I won't recommend this.

I have to say that the reviews were True. Extremely crispy which includes the Sicilian pizza (I know it better as pan pizza). The dough between the crust and topping was soft but not undercooked.   I went for the lunch special, one cheese pizza, and a sausage pizza.  Both were crispy bottom that you could fold.  The portions were the size a a New York style pizza... LARGE!  I would highly recommend this place for the crispy crust alone, but the topping are delicious and fit well with the pizza.",

They were warm, doughy, and as you would expect, garlicky.   We split a medium pizza that was half buffalo chicken, half combo with pepperoni, banana peppers, pineapple, and red onions.   The combo part of the pizza was pretty bland. I don't think they used fresh ingredients because the pineapple was white and none of the toppings had flavor. The buffalo chicken had more flavor from the hot sauce, but it was nothing special. The crust was crunchy and flavorless.   They have a good lunch special--two pieces of cheese pizza and a drink for $5.   This tasted nothing like NY pizza. I'd rather go elsewhere to get better pizza personally.",

They're good enough for a Tuesday night, but the whole time you're watching you know in the back of your mind that there's something so much better out there? That's 500 Degrees. This place certainly isn't the worst pizza I've ever had. I'm not mad at it. But it's just kinda meh. The interior has charm enough. I love the retro tap style soda fountain. The pizza is just uninspired. I feel like I could have made something better in 30 minutes at home. There's so much great pizza out there, and these slices just reminded me of how great my favorite spots are.

Then we tried to call in after being on hold and going up on for 15 minutes we drove in.   It took one hour to get 2 pizzas to go and we arrived at 11:15.  This place used to be the best pizza place.   This is our third bad experience in a row.  There were lots of folks standing and waiting for an hour to get a pizza.  Not acceptable for pizza.  If you are on a time constraint try somewhere else until the new folks figure it out.  What a shame.",

They always load my pizza with the best toppings. I firmly believe a great pizza is made of great sauce, amazing crust and the perfect topping to pizza ratio. The cheese is extra cheesy as it should be and you can see the strings when you bite into it.   Top 3 things I enjoy, spaghetti parmesan, grandma pizza, and I create my own loaded with pineapple. .  I can't wait to return.",

Got two slices of the sicilian cheese for $2.5 each and a small pasta with meat sauce for $5 in case we weren't full. My one gripe would be we wanted a slice of cheese pizza but they were out?? This was 6pm on a Saturday night. What establishment doesn't have slices of cheese pizza available??   Got our food pretty fast, sicilian squares were decent sized, piping hot, crunchy bottom, cheese tasted great, sauce was great. All in all a great slice of pizza. I added some of the red chili flakes and parm they had on the side. I think they also had salt, pepper, and garlic powder. They had some convenient paper towels rolls on the wall.   The pasta was also great, just spaghetti from a box but the sauce was pretty good and it came with half a baguette size of garlic bread which was great!   Overall quality of food was great. Apparently it's cheesier than real NYC pizza but I liked it that way haha. Pretty cheap, but please next time I go they better have cheese pizza!!!",

The ordering process was a major pain in the ass.  The website didn't work.  After numerous attempts we called.  And then we had difficulty using the coupon.  It was an annoying time suck.  We were told an hour for delivery.  The order showed up 20 minutes later.    The salad was pretty bad.  The ingredients fresh and fine.  But flavor was lacking.  It lacked any shred of creativity.  Stromboli - also ok.  But not something that I need to eat again.  Same for the wings and pizza.  All Ok, but not worth the calories that I was allowing myself for a cheat meal.    I have a pizza oven at home.  \"500 Degrees\" is actually pretty pathetic given that my oven gets up to 1000 degrees and the pizza that comes out of my oven is in every superior to that of \"500 Degrees\".    I have a buttload of leftovers in my fridge.  Usually i love leftover pizza.  But I have no interest in eating the rest of this pie.  I won't be ordering from 500 degrees again.",

I ordered the sicilian cheese pizza an garlic cheese bread, my friend ordered a salad an wings with no sauce just fried.  I had my pizza and cheese bread before he got his salad, not a good sign. It took them 10 mins plus to throw some lettece , 2 tomatoes an a few black olives on a paper plate !!!  I finished my pizza an bread before his wings came, if they were busy it would have been a different story, there were less than 5 people in the whole place. Anyhoo, back to the pizza at hand, the sicilian was just some dough and cheese thrown on top not impressed.  The wings were so small and fried hard, somebody needs to teach these folks about pizza an wings.  I wont  go back, I read somebody's comment that the service was fast I had to laugh.  Heres a little extra for you, as I walked to the bathroom i'm not sure but looked like a generator in the hallway just saying.  As I walked in the bathroom I was taken back to see the toliet with no lid, now we know us ladies dont sit on public bathrooms but i found it rather odd.  But you decide for yourself if you'd like to try this place :)",

    "text": "So this particular weekend I had a taste for a slice and since I have been back in town from NYC (Brooklyn to be exact) for about a year,  my taste bud was desperately yearning for the taste of a pepperoni slice.  Anyway, I came here to check for some reviews since my previous experiences with Pizza in town have been a mayor let down, I stumble into New York pizza reviews here on yelp and it instantly clicked in my memory that I'd visited this spot before. I checked the reviews to see if they were still good before heading out that way (it's 20 minutes from where I stay) and after reading how great this place continues to be,  I decided to come here and finally get that slice that I was craving for. All I can say is this...  They have gotten better and they are simply delicious. Don't get me wrong,  they were good before,  but unless I was in the area,  I was not making a trip at all,  but now I will certainly do so. They finally understand what NY style pizza is all about and how it should taste, fold, and also how greasy and delicious it should be.  From the cheese to the dough and the taste,  it instantly took me back home and it finally ended my pizza drought that I have been in for a year since I came back to town.  Plus,  the beef patties...  They were superb before and they are still kicking ass today and I like the fact they close at 11pm on Fridays and 10pm on Saturdays. My only two tiny complaints...  The slices are not as big Tony's.  Don't get me wrong,  it is nowhere a small size and it is big, but Tony's got them beat for a little bit in that department (to my New Yorkers read my review on this spot). Plus,  I don't like the fact they are close on Sundays.  However even with those tiny complaints,  this place is good,  delicious,  fast,  clean and simply great and it deserves the score I'm giving it.  If you want True NY style pizza and beef patties, to all my New Yorkers or anyone from the tristate this is the place to go and it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE. P. S.  THE DROUGHT IS OVER! :)",

It's got your standard Pizzeria menu with subs, salads, some pastas, apps, and of course pizza.  They are reasonably priced and the owners are friendly.  They used to have it set up so you could see the pizza being made, but now there's a high counter blocking the view.  Too bad, I like being able to see the dough being stretched and the skill of the kitchen workers.  Everyone should have a pizza place like this close to home! One of my favorite things about the pizza is the crisp crust.  This is easy to find when eating a reheated slice, but not so easy when you order a whole pie.  They make one of the crispiest fresh pie crusts in Charlotte.  There's always a nice snap.  This pizza will fill you up, it can be heavy in the belly, but comfort food does that.  This is better pizza than most in Charlotte.",

The salad was large & fresh, however the ranch dressing was right out a store bought jar. As for the pizza, it was served hot, but the crust was a little hard & like the ranch, the pepperoni tasted like those pepperoni's bought in the bag at the grocery store. I ended up picking those off & enjoyed basically a cheese pizza. Unfortunately it didn't meet up to Tony's, still my favorite New York Style Pizza!",

The crust is baked well, the cheese is great, and the toppings are.... so good. It's pretty amazing that they can deliver a tasty slice at the right price.  As for atmosphere, it's a clean restaurant that is thoughtfully put together. What really please me was that each booth had a paper towel rack installed with seasoning right below; once I'm chowing down on my pizza, I am not getting up for anything! So with everything I need is conveniently placed near me, I enjoyed every bite without having to move.  Service is nice and friendly.  I would return here for lunch or for a late night snack. Def worth a try!",

But because a friend who loves NY style pizza tried and loved it I decided to take a chance.  They serve pizza by the slice and True to NY style they are huge thin crust slices that you can fold over to get it in your mouth. If you see someone take a knife and fork to it, smack them. I assume it could only add to their authentic NY experience. THen show them how to eat it properly. Fold nearly in half, insert into mouth. If you don't like pizza, you probably got dragged here with a friend but it's okay. They serve subs and salads too. I will definitely be back for a slice or two but hope to also try their Italian subs.",

I was greeted upon walking in. The place is small near the end of a strip center. Appears clean and nicely decorated for a pizza joint. I ordered hot wings extra crispy, small salad and one slice of pepperoni pizza. I waited less than 10 minutes. I was concerned the food wouldn't be great because I live over 15 minutes away and it was rush hour. Wings were buffalo hot, could have been a bit crispier but they tasted great. Salad was nice and fresh---thank you. So many times in a small place like this, the salads are never fresh. Slice of pepperoni pizza was dripping in grease and covered in cheese---perfect!  Exactly what I was hoping for. The bottom was crispy but also folded nicely in half so I didn't even up getting grease on me. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for this type of place. Would I return--sure!",
