All the chairs there are high...the kind that make your feet dangle over the side as they can't reach the ground.  This is painful for people with certain medical conditions.  My wife was in pain the entire time we were there.  Also, the place was very tightly packed.  The tables were too small to allow you to stretch out at all.  The food was pretty good but I probably won't go back.",

I'm a fan of Ru Sans, but the past couple of times I had been there much was to be desired....and it was noisy 9/10 times. The NZC is in a nice spot, and although the place is small, it's cozy and you can actually hear a conversation. The waitress was polite and tentative, as well as the greeter. The biggest thing though- was the Sushi. I had a ginger salad to start (yum), then the Vegetable Tempura Maki roll (yum) and sampled some of my friends crispy Tuna Maki roll- also yum. I found a new Sushi place to go- goodbye Ru Sans.",

The sushi prices are extremely reasonable and the best of the places I have tried. The sushi itself is fresh, creative and I've never been disappointed.  I also appreciate that Chef Jackie gives me a nod and a smile even though we have never officially been introduced.  I love this place. Just be aware that since it's so small there is typically a wait to be seated.  It's best to go when they first open or well after normal dining hours. Also keep in mind that if you place a to go order, make sure you order everything you need. On more than one occasion if I needed to add sauces, etc after I had already placed the phone order and hung up that I didn't get the extras when I requested them upon my arrival.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place, but it just didn't happen-at all. We got a to-go order of \"potstickers\", snow crab/shrimp roll, and a salmon tempura roll. We were told it would be ready in 20 minutes on a Sunday (about 8:30 P.M.)      To start, the place is like a broom closet. As you walk in, the register is at the far end of the restaurant - with literally 2 feet between the counter and the drink stand. While waiting in line to pay, we had to maneuver around the 2 foot space 3x for the wait staff.       The chefs didn't even begin to make our order until 10 minutes after our 20 minute arrival time. After paying, we moved to stand by the hallway to the restrooms, still seemly in the way of everyone- it was very uncomfortable. On to the food:      The salmon tempura roll was a sad sight, but tasted okay. The crab/shrimp roll: the shrimp and avocado were fresh, but the crab looked like little hairs and was poorly represented. The \"potstickers/gyoza\" were a pathetic excuse for their name. They were mushy and bland. Even the dipping sauce served with them was a pale representation of what it should have been.       I know of many others that are much better than this place. They can serve 1$ sushi all day long, but I'll never come back.",

It was quite a trek out there for us, but looking at 20+ reviews of only 4 and 5 stars was convincing.   Not being a huge sushi eater, i went with the H.O.T. rolls and something i knew i'd enjoy in the buffalo shrimp dinner. For non-sushi fans, the H.O.T. rolls really don't have any sort of gross sushiness to them, so a good choice in that respect. They didn't wow us all that much though. The buffalo shrimp came with rice, a salad and two sticks of chicken. The rice and shrimp were good and the salad was decent with a couple cucumbers, but the chicken on a stick was like something you find on a Chinese buffet.  My wife, the reason i frequently end up at sushi places was happy with the prices, but didn't think the sushi stood out from others (Nikko or Edomae) . She ordered the rainbow roll and the bagel roll. The rainbow roll didn't seem to have all that great quality of fish, some of it was chewy. The bagel roll was like a ground salmon that didn't have the typical salmon flavor she was expecting from sushi.  She's still convinced that the quality of Nikko's sushi is still superior.",

It can get really crowded for dine in, so be sure to expect a wait.. a wait well worth it. Carry-out is also an option I have done a few times.  The sashimi bento box was delicious. The fish is very fresh and they roll the sushi right in front of you. They have $1 nigiri which is phenomenal and very high quality. The prices here are cheaper then most places and the sushi is better tasting and higher quality. My favorite rolls are the spicy tuna and the tempura rolls. I have a lot more to try!   5 stars",

I've always wanted this place to be my little secret but obviously its popularity has made it one of the best sushi places in the city.   It's nearly impossible to get a table here for dinner on the weekends; everyone is waiting outside. Hence, I try to come here for lunch (since they offer the same menu anyways). I always get the same things: vegetable tempura, salmon skin hand roll, and the boss roll. Oh yeah, the boss roll is my favorite. Great flavors with lightly battered tempura shrimp inside that's still crispy when they serve it to you. They are also very generous with the amount of salmon skin that they give you in their rolls.  Would I come back here again? Most definitely. The service here is outstanding as well and even though they're very busy, they make sure you're enjoying your meal and your drinks are refreshed. While I understand it's not Jiro's or any other fancy sushi hotspots, it is one of the best in Charlotte. Before you leave, you must try the fried ice cream as well! Crispy on the outside but chill and creamy in the inside.",

I hate rolls, especially those with all the sauces covering the rolls, that has no way to show the quality of the fish in there.  These are what we have strong comments on:  Marugai (geoduck), they gave us the tsubugai (conch). Hotate (scallop) was yellowish in color and dried.  Uni was bitter and brownish in color, very fishy smell.  (That indicates how long it has been sitting in their cooler) Others are not memorable, but overall is below average in freshness.  The waitress (owner) shows no interests in talking or having eye contact with customers.  Had yelled at the wait staffs couple of times.  The whole experience should warrant a 2 or 3 stars review.

Unfortunately, the last time I had the dressing, it tasted very differently; more \"mayo-y\" than gingery. It's hard to explain, but I much prefer the former dressing. I took a star off for that and also because of the waiting time. These people get busy...like REALLY busy!! 95% of the time I order takeout and always leave about 10 minutes after they two me it's going to be ready, but when I get there I almost always have to wait an additional 10-15 minutes (sometimes even longer). Good things come to those who wait, so I don't really mind, but I'd just rather get told a more accurate time of when it'll be ready so I don't waste time sitting in a parking lot. Other than that minor thing the sushi is super good!!!!",

    "text": "Dropped in this evening for the first time after having a craving for sushi .  After viewing the menu online via phone, I made up my mind.  There were a couple people waiting/hanging outside.  There was a line but it moved quickly.  They take debit and split tenders with cash.  I was told the wait would be 30 mins after I paid.  I used the restroom and sat in a chair in the hallway.  Quickly 30 mins went by and a waitress stopped to ask if I was dining in and I told her I had an order.  I gave her the order number and she never responded back about it.  Yet, she came down the hallway often (backway to kitchen?), checked low drinks at tables, and seated two sets of people from the hallway.  I was sitting in the first chair in the hallway yet felt I wasn't as important since I had takeout.  Then 45mins went by and I got up to ask a waitress passing through the checkout line.  She grabbed my bag which seemed to have been ready for a couple mins or while.  Needless to say the meal was delicious even the Spicy Tuna which was a second choice for a little something extra to complete my meal of the Sweet Dragon.  I brewed some Oolong tea at home.  I will return for the Bento Box but I will call my orders in for now on.  Please call out takeout order numbers or have a waitress notify people when they're order is ready.  I will check for weekly specials and deals.  I hope they'll open a bigger location or second location.  Too small of the business is normally like this.",

Nothing to really complain about since it was a warm summer Friday night. After the wait we were seated at the sushi bar. My oh my....if you want to really see how a sushi restaurant works....sit near the sushi bar!!!! First thing I noticed was the 91 sanitation grade. Which isn't terrible but in no way is it great either. Second thing I noticed was how the employees who were taking orders, money and handing take out orders to paying customers, were also putting the new tickets they rang up, on the bamboo sheets thay are used for the creation of the sushi rolls and those bamboo sheets were never washed before being used. To make it worse, those tickets placed on the bamboo sheets by the cashiers often times touched the sushi rolls and the plates after the sushi chef made the rolls.  Disgusting. Your nasty money handling hands have just put a piece of paper you touched onto the clean plates. We also sat in front of a decorative lamp that my fiance mentioned was filthy. Now, on to the food. I ordered a few rolls for myself. A spicy tuna roll, a HOT roll, a Philly roll and another roll I cant remember the name of. All of the rolls tasted pretty good. Nothing to rant about. The creations were relatively basic and but decently fresh. My fiance ordered spring rolls which she said were great. For her entree she ordered the hibachi chicken. The first thing she said when she got her food was that the chicken was definitely frozen and tasted as such. She also said the flavors weren't as great as she expected. Staff was friendly. All in all I will not go back to this place. Cleanliness is the biggest drawback at this place.",

I was a giant fan of Ru San in Dilworth for years.  Then Ru San picked up a poor score on the sanitary scale and that was the end of it for me.  NZ is always at \"A\", kinda critical for a sushi place (with a C, sushi becomes bait).",

I also had a crunchy lobster salad roll which looked great but it was way too chewy and the crunch was actually wet and mushy........yuk!

Although you may be tempted to go for the bento / cooked food - it tends to be way more affordable - stay True and stick to the sushi! The magic of NZC truly lies in their rolls. You can't really go wrong with whatever you choose, but my recommendations include the following:  -Negi Hamachi: Classic, delicious. -Super Spicy Roll: Spicy yellow tail, tuna, salmon, avocado, smelt roe  & scallions -Favorite Roll: Tempura shrimp, snow crab, avocado, spicy mayo, wrapped in soybean paper :)  This place is boss, give it a visit!",

They are super consistent with their quality.  I've tried most of the major sushi players and there are others that are great at times, but they just don't have the consistency.  If you love sushi and you haven't been here, make it your next destination and you'll be impressed.  The place is small, and it's not fancy.  They deserve to be on a wait every night.",

Also tried some sort of fried roll with a mayo based sauce, it was just aiite, and the Wasabi Salmon Roll that also had some sort of sauce that included sriracha, also, aiite.   Overall, pretty good for a sushi place in Charlotte, and just right in the budget range.    There can be a bit of a wait, even when you call ahead and are told there's no wait.",

The customer service is hospitable and communitive. The only reason I gave four stars is becuase of the size of the facility. I dig the quaint appeal; the charm emphasizes the food. However there isn't much seating, making it snug on a packed night and you'll most likely have to wait. Nevertheless, the food is worth the wait and will distract you from the close corners. I don't think it's family-friendly - not that the atmosphere is too mature or the staff shuns from children, (they're really sweet toward the younger guests). Again, the size of the place that would make bringing your family rather awkward. But great for business meetings, hanging with friends, or date night. Go there this Friday night! You won't regret it!",

    "text": "I hate to write bad reviews, but I am literally blown away with how bad the sushi was from here. My husband has been wanting to try this place for a while, so we took the opportunity to order a bunch of rolls from here since we have family in town.   First of all, when my husband called to place the order, they told him it would be ready in 15min....which seemed pretty fast for a Saturday night, but whatever. My husband shows up 20min later, only to end up sitting there waiting for the food to be ready for ANOTHER 55min (which means it was an hour and fifteen minutes from when he called, as opposed to the fifteen minutes he was originally told). Sadly, the odd wait and takeout situation wasn't even the worst part.  I've had really great sushi before (at a few different places in Charlotte), and I've also had really bad sushi. Now, I get that sushi taste can be sometimes subjective; but there are some things that everyone can agree are just bad. This food was one of those times. How do you screw up a shrimp tempura roll?? It wasn't even that it was takeout of a fried item, it was clearly WAY over cooked, and had brown avocado. Just nasty. And the rolls we had that contained tuna (or I should say were supposed to contain spicy tuna) actually looked like there was dried cheap canned tuna in them. When you spit a bite of something out, and throw the remaining entire roll into the trash, it's BAD. I've never been so embarrassed about our food choices before, but I was mortified that every persons sushi rolls were basically inedible. We ordered 8 rolls + a bento box...how you can have that bad statistical probability that all of it was that bad?   Which brings me to my question: how on EARTH were they as busy as they were, and how do they have 4stars on yelp, if their food is this bad?  I'm lost. But you literally couldn't pay me good money to eat here ever again. Sad.  Side note: because I'm desperately trying to find something positive about this place, their side sauces were good. Also, the way that they packaged up our order was very nice.",

It look's a little dive-y / hole-in-wall from the outside, but inside this place is a real gem.   I opted to go with the bento box so I could get a little taste of everything. The hibachi chicken box ($12.99) came with chicken hibachi, white rice, a California sushi roll, ginger salad, 2 pcs shrimp tempura, and a few tempura battered/fried veggies. What a steal!  The chicken hibachi was full of flavor and veggies. The sushi was fresh & the ginger salad had a great taste. The other sushi I saw coming out of the kitchen looked awesome, so I'll definitely give that a try next time. A real sushi gem the Sardis area.",

Since it's so small, they only have one sushi chef and it takes them a while to be served, but man is it worth it. The flavors are succinct and as imaginative as some of the other 'fancy' sushi places around, but the value here can't be beat. They are an old friend that you can always come back to for a nice conversation and a good time.   It's a very casual environment and the service is clean.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's difficult to get a table, or even to get to the counter to pick up a to go order, and I hate those hi-top tables.  But the sushi?? Excellent!  The staff is helpful and attentive and the menu has something for everyone.  If you don't like sushi, no problem, they have plenty of Asian dinners on the menu to satisfy anyone, and they give you lots of food.  If you have time to wait for a table it is well worth the trip.  I recommend going at odd times, like after the lunch rush or right after work for an early dinner.  You are less likely to have to wait the standard 30-45 minutes for a table.  I wish they would move to a larger location, but at the same time I worry that would affect the quality and pricing of their food.  I've tried other places, but always come back to New Zealand.  The freshness of the fish, inventive rolls, and value for your money can't be beat.  If I have friends visit from out of town, I always take them to New Zealand.  It's a hole in the wall gem that most people, who aren't familiar with them, would drive by.",

And by super, I mean a 2 hour wait on a Wednesday night. Well, technically it was like an hour wait to even get seated. Once inside, I realized that this place is pretty small and cozy, so seating is limited. We chose to sit at the bar because spots opened up. We ordered 4 rolls to share amongst 5 people. Our server was friendly but it still took a long time for food to come.. almost an hour I'd say. It was interesting to see the talented and very speedy sushi chefs crank out rolls, but at the same time it was sad just wondering if they were finally making ours and watching the plates being whisked away. I think they felt bad that we were waiting so long, so they put 4 of our rolls onto a sushi boat without us asking. I think my favorite roll was the big boss roll (it's their most popular one), and the discovery roll was also good. All the rolls were unique and flavorful. I never really tend to opt for the more traditional options so I can't really speak to those. Their selection is quite expansive.  Honestly, this place should expand to a bigger space - I think that's their main problem right now. I would come back again in a heartbeat, but I'd advise coming here early or else you'll likely be hangry like us. Quite a few people called and got their order to-go, which is also a smart move.",

They also have different meals to choose from that you would find in a normal Chinese restaurant and you get a lot of food for the price- I recommend the Queen City Chicken- which is their take on sesame chicken.  If they're busy, seating is a little cramped because it is a small space, and it can get a little loud will all those people in such a tiny area.

It is undeniable that New Zealand Cafe is a very busy and popular restaurant. But \"busy\" is not always a good sign; sometimes it just means there are a lack of other restaurants of high quality. Such is the case with New Zealand Cafe. It is a good restaurant with good food, but it stops there.  The food seemed fresh, but it was not like, \"oh my God this is so fresh!\" kind of feel. When you taste really fresh food, your taste buds will scream for joy! Again, food was good, but not \"OMG I can't wait for another bite!\".  I wanted to give this place five stars, but it fell short in a couple of areas: (1) service was fast, but not friendly; (2) if you like fake crab meat in your sushi, this is your place; (3) the soda dispensing machine is right next to the bar and some tables; this is constantly in use, inhibiting your privacy at your table plus the fact that constantly falling ice is noisy. It should be re-located away from the customers' dining experience.  I would not say the restaurant fell flat. Rather, it fell short of what we had hoped and read. If more sushi places were available, I don't think New Zealand Cafe would be as busy as it was, unfortunately.",

The sushi was good, not amazing, but again, we didn't spent the normal $80 for two people which usually happens with my sushi-obsessed husband.  The best deal here are the meals!  For $6.95 you get your meal (we got chicken teriyaki) which includes actual chicken breast and fresh veggies, rice, salad and two small fried appetizers.  It's served on this giant tray- great value for the money!  If we are in the area we'd go again, but not driving the 20 minutes again.",

It looked like it was a large space and would have a lot of televisions.    Fast forward a couple of years, some good Yelp reviews and an invitation from friends, well maybe I should give it a chance.  The place is tiny, it has about 9 tables and 4 seats at the sushi bar with a bunch of televisions. Televisions are in the darndest places. The food is delicious.  There is more to offer than sushi, but I have only been twice and sushi is the only thing that I order.  I might go as far as saying it is my favorite sushi restaurant.  Every roll has been delicious, well, except for one.   Tonight we ordered a California roll with tuna and the tuna was mushy on top, my husband said it was like cat food.  That was a bit disappointing, but not enough to make me deduct a star and certainly not enough to keep me from returning.  My favorite roll tonight had diced jalapenos and it was burn the baby hot. It made me cry tears of happiness. Booooohoooooo.",

    "text": "I posted a review about this place before, but after going last night for the 3rd day in a row... YES it's that good... I had to post more.   I've come to realize that New Zealand will always have a wait when you get there, no matter what time of day. The reason, it's THAT good. People have waited 30 minutes or longer for a table at this place. I should know because I am one of those people, and I'd wait even longer if I had to just to get inside to eat.   For those who are hungry now, call in a take out order, that way you can run inside to grab your grub and be on your way. I just love this place, and every time I've gone I've gotten the same thing. I order a tray with the honey chicken and shrimp & it's enough to make me start drooling at my desk just thinking about it again.   Well, last night I decided to go to try the sushi after my friend twisted my arm a bit. She said, \"You can't go to New Zealand and not try the sushi!!!\" I informed her that, yes I could, and I did it often. But, she was right.   I ordered a tasty roll, which is salmon, cream cheese, and some other concoctions lightly fried. I almost fell backwards in my chair and passed out because the taste punched me in my face. God parted the clouds and a beam of light blew up my taste buds when that sushi entered my body. I swear to you, I've NEVER had better sushi than this in my life... and I'm a gal who enjoys her sushi.   I'm convinced that there is nothing bad you can order on their menu. It is just insane how good the food is here. The prices are beyond reasonable, the taste is fantastic, obviously and it's in a close proximity to my house. But if it weren't I wouldn't care, I'd drive an hour to eat here. Oh New Zealand, I heart you a bunch.",

The sushi is really average, it taste like grocery store bought sushi,except it's not cold. Most of their rolls are deep fried.

Harsh perhaps, but True.  I went all nigiri here; I appreciate that all fish has its Japanese name, even though the server couldn't understand my white-guy pronunciation.  Anyways, some things I tried were fresh, some were clearly thawed from frozen.  Some items that I ordered were subbed out, (e.g. I ordered ama ebi, got ebi...that'd be like ordering raw tuna, and receiving fried catfish).  and some simply were not served (where's the hamachi)?    It was by no means terrible, and for the price I would go again, but don't expect to get blown away here.  NZ cafe is affordable sushi in a strip mall, no more, no less.",

Last time I was here I waited for my take out order over an hour and when I asked for a second time if it would be much longer (politely, but I'm sure you could detect slight irritation in my voice) I was told very rudely that it would come out soon and to sit down and wait......like excuse me? At least apologize that I've been here for over an hour...or just don't snap at me! Personally, I would rather go somewhere with decent food and better atmosphere.",

I thought \"what do they eat in Australia?\"  Then a friend suggested that I try it out for sushi.  I don't so sushi so again, went about life.    Well, I've tried it now twice and while I haven't tried the sushi, the other dishes are great.  This place is pretty cool.  It's in a divey plaza wedged into the corner next to a take out chinese place and something else on the other side.  They have a sushi bar and about a hand full of high top 4 place tables and a few lower ones in the middle.  I've been in larger walk-in closets.    The food is good...really good.  I ordered a lettuce wrap and it was exactly what I wanted.  Why can't more places do a decent lettuce wrap?  The hibachi chicken was a little unexpected.  It came in a bento box-like contraption with rice in the corner, the chicken the veg in the center, more chicken on skewers, salad in another corner and even two crab rangoons (I guess - who knows how it's spelled...and I know what you're thinking \"Why not just use google to find out how to spell it!...\"  I just did and it is rangoon\".  You sushi people, don't fret. I'm sure someone else had that and thought it was good.  If you order a lot of sushi, they bring it out in a boat which is pretty cool.    I grew up thinking that Japanese food required a bunch of pageantry and pantomime but I don't want that.  I want some rice or noodles, some lettuce and veg that's crisp and some meat prepared properly.  This place get's it for me.  Definitely one to put in the rotation.",

My boys had the chicken teriyaki bento boxes and the chicken tasted like frozen chicken from a bag. The spicy tuna rolls weren't spicy at all and the sushi was poorly wrapped. Although fairly priced, I'm seeing you truly get what you pay for. I was greatly disappointed in this restaurant, especially after reading such great reviews.",

We got there and were sat at one of the tiny tables in the middle of the restaurant. I felt really close to the people next to us but was okay with it. We got there just in time because there ended up being a wait and quite a bit of congestion with to go orders.   We started with pan fried potstickers. Only one side of the potstickers were crunchy and the other side had a steamed consistency.  I liked them and my boyfriend thought they were just okay. For our meals, I ordered the tasty roll and big boss roll. My boyfriend got the fried pork chop meal. I loved the big boss roll and the tasty roll was okay but a bit too heavy for me and I only ate a few pieces. I don't fault the restaurant for that, I am just not the biggest fan of fried rolls. My boyfriend loved his meal and all of the sauces that came with it. He said he would definitely get it again.   I took one star off because it's just sooooooo small and congested. That said, we really liked it and will be back.",

Also, the wine list really needs a makeover.  The Uni is worth the wait!",

I've been hearing about this place for a while and it was totally worth the drive from Huntersville! I wish they would open a location up here! I have tried so many sushi places around north Charlotte and central Charlotte and this is hands down the best one. Nothing in north Charlotte/Huntersville area is that good, just tolerable for my sushi cravings. This place is Small but so fresh, great prices, I will def be making the 40 minute drive more often! This is what I have been looking for, too bad it's so far away!",

So the bad...the place is packed and you'll have to wait, once you get seated be prepared to wait some more. This place has a very high demand for take out, I'm assuming via phone orders...so even though they have a full staff making sushi non stop the wait for your food is going to be longer than what most people would be accustomed to. Now, why is this still 5 stars?? Because the quality and price for the sushi is unheard of! Excellent specialty rolls, high quality nigiri and sashimi and all for a very affordable price. Try everything you won't be let down!",

While the food and prices are good this by far is one of the most uncomfortable restaurants I've ever eaten in. If you are seated in the strip of tables down the middle of the place you are literally shoulder to shoulder with the other people seated next to you.  Everyone is on top of each other, there is no room. It's so small people wait outside for their name to be called for a table. No big deal unless it's 40 degrees outside like last Friday. People stand there with the door open to give the hostess their name, people are constantly coming in and out getting takeout, the hostess holds the door open while calling out names to be seated and so on and so on. It's like sitting outside and it's ridiculous.   As much as we like the food the actual setup of the restaurant is just plain awful to the point that it's just going to be take out from here on out.",

It was on the cheaper Monday night and I'm assuming that the reason it's priced so low is because it is the leftover sushi from the high volumes they probably move on the weekend.  It only makes sense that they charge like a dollar for a piece bc the sushi isn't as fresh.  I probably won't be back bc I really wanted good sushi and didn't like it very much here.

Have to agree with most of the reviews of this place since it is very unassuming and located in a strip mall.  The place has a lot of charm and personality and I am really glad it is in my neck of the woods.  I can totally see myself becoming a regular here.  I had the Tuna Crunchy Roll and the Sweet Dragon Roll which were both outstanding for the price.  We did have a little bit of a wait because there was a huge sushi order prior to ours... It was pretty amazing to see 4-5 sushi boats filled to the brim be delivered over to a 4 person table.  They ended up not finishing everything and having 3 full size take home boxes of sushi!  Maybe they were bringing them over to an adult baseball league afterwards...  It was a ton of sushi.   Can't wait to go back and sample more rolls and maybe a bento box or 30.  The menu took a while to read through, but I'm sure all the options are just as good as what I ordered.  The wait-staff was very warm and inviting... one of the waitresses in particular recognized some regulars and it was hard not to be swept up in her enthusiasm.  Definitely hard to find positive people like that now a days especially in a tough position serving others.",

For sushi, I had a tuna hand roll, tuna, Iidako (baby octopus), salmon roe and tamago nigiri. They all lived up to my expectations. On top of that, they even gave me an extra baby octopus!   On the benzo side, everything was very standard, well-executed. I would highly recommend the black pepper steak.   Overall it was a good experience, and I'll be back soon.",

As close to west coast sushi as you can get and some of the rolls are better then what I get in San Diego. The servers are always nice and I sit at the sushi bar to bs with the sushi chefs. If I could give them more stars I would.",

We like the casual environment this place offers.  One of the waitresses knows us so well, the first thing she will ask us is if we'd like to put in our order for the Fantasy Shrimp bento and to give us a pen knowing we always order about 20 pieces of random fresh nigiris and sashimis. They take care of you here, if you give them a chance.  Our only complaint is that the place is tiny which means there can be a bit of a wait for seating and your food, but it hasn't stopped us from coming back. This place isn't for everyone, and we are OK with that. :)",

The fella is a serious sushi-lover, and after the numerous places he's eaten, he still thinks Musashi in south Charlotte is the very best when it comes to sushi. After our first trip to New Zealand Cafe (thanks to Yelpers' suggestions), it just leap-frogged to No. 2 of all time.   We started with the steamed pot stickers, which were fresh and delicious. I'm not a sushi eater, so I appreciated that they had other options. I got the chicken bento box, which came with chicken and broccoli in a delicious, homemade brown sauce, two fried shrimp, two crab rangoons, brown rice, and a salad. I also appreciated that they offered me a fork! He got a special roll - the Bamboo  - along with a few pieces of Nigiri. There weren't as many pieces in the Bamboo roll as he hoped, but that was the only bad thing about it.   Service was outstanding, and since they were even more packed than usual and running a little behind, they brought us complimentary edamame. The only negative thing I can say isn't even their fault - their food is so delicious and their space is so small that it was a 30-minute wait at 5:30 on a Saturday with hardly anywhere to stand inside on a cold day.",

    "text": "After reading all the rave reviews about NZ Cafe, knowing I'm still on the search for my go-to sushi place in and around Charlotte, I had to give them a try.   Per the suggestions of others my bf and I went for a late lunch during the week to try to avoid a crowd. We got there around 1:45pm and there were a couple tables open - no one is kidding when they say this place is tiny. But, that wasn't necessarily a shot against it - our waiter could see us from essentially anywhere in the restaurant so when we were ready to order it was super easy to flag him down. Speaking of which, the service in general was pretty good. My water was always filled and they checked up on us a couple times to make sure the food was satisfactory.  We ended up going with a few rolls and several pieces of nigiri. The fish itself tasted very fresh, I would almost just get nigiri next time, and I enjoyed the rolls but I have definitely had better. The prices are pretty much unbeatable and the list of options is fairly extensive. It seemed like many of the rolls had a lot of the same ingredients though so if you're looking for variety (and sans cream cheese) you might be looking for a little while.   All in all, if I was in the area already I would definitely stop in for a late lunch again. But it's a little too out of the way (35min drive) and didn't knock my socks off enough for me to justify going regularly.",

When we pulled up we were all very skeptical - it is not much to look at from the outside.    Well, it was incredible.  Best sushi in Charlotte, no argument.  The two rolls I ordered -- the Big Boss (I think) and the Shrimp and Crab (I think - I can't remember) were perfection.  It is 100% worth the trek out there if you do not live nearby. Service was great even though they were slammed.  It didn't bother me too much, but you should know that many of the printed menus contain different items - so take a look at the 100 menus they give you.  I cannot WAIT to go back and I'm hoping it becomes a weekly tradition (or hopefully more often!)",

    "text": "Sushi is my favorite food, and being new to Charlotte, I relied on Yelp to give me some recommendations. Therefore, I gave New Zealand Cafe a shot, despite the already questionable restaurant name.  I suppose it is unfair since I am comparing my experiences to sushi restaurants in Los Angeles and Boston (hometown and schooltown), so I will just cover the things that should NEVER happen at a sushi restaurant just to be fair.  1. If you are going to be a sushi waitress, please pronounce the menu correctly! Tuna is said, MAguro, not maGURO. Please get the inflection right.  2. When ordering nigiri, it should not turn into an order of sashimi and rice. Nigiri means sashimi STICKS to the rice, which = not falling apart.  3. It is very unappetizing to see blood from your sashimi on your dish.  4. Green tea from a tea bag? Really?  5. If you offer fried ice cream (I'm assuming this is tempura?), why does it only come in vanilla when you have green tea and red bean on the ice cream menu as well?  See, I haven't even got into the freshness of the sushi (which not all of it was made to order since I sat at the sushi bar) or the sashimi, or any complicated standards that I usually have. I am sorry, if this is the best sushi in Charlotte, because it was the worse sushi I have ever had, then I suppose it says a lot about the food scene.  If anyone has any recommendations for sushi, please please please send me a message!",

Very fresh, I know this because it took a bit longer than  most sushi places to get my order (wasabi  tuna roll and yellowtail maki) but well worth the wait. The fish was cold and firm, a must for me to qualify the sushi as \"fresh\"! Some places have \"wimpy\" green wasabi, not this place, it's the very dense kind with a kick. I love the \"sinus clearing\" effect, great pickled ginger too! Very reasonable prices and they have lots of specials and a huge selection of rolls, some are even on a picture menu for the \"novice\" sushi eater. I did not try any of their hot entrees but saw several and they looked like good portions and tasty. The service was excellent, I was kind of in a hurry to get to a movie, they got me my check and cashed out right away when I let them know. I will be back here again soon! Definitely worth checking out :-)",

With 3 servers and under 10 tables during lunch, nobody can provide me any service?! My money is just as good as the next person. The older Asian lady, I assume she is the manager gives the worse service especially when my friend and I came here for lunch. My friend who is also in the food industry agrees. If you get great service from her than your probably a regular here or not of a minority group. 2 stars because I love the food and its close to my house but sadly, I won't be returning.",

We also have young children and have been surprised more than once by an impromptu dessert of free sliced oranges for them sent over by Jackie the lead chef.  If you want to go to Center City and pay $10 for a California roll be my guest but the sushi here is worth the wait.",

Try the favorite roll -ironically my favorite roll! Salt and pepper calamari and lettuce wraps are are good starters.

We walked in and the place was absolutely slammed for a Monday, so that was a great sign.  The seating is a bit too close for comfort in my opinion- conversations next to us were distracting as I am sure we were to others as well. Service was poor and slow . We had two servers (I think?), my point is that I really had no idea who our actual server was.  we ordered four rolls:  christmas, sweet dragon, crazy, and discovery  We only really cared for two out of four (s.d and christmas) - disovery was one of the worst rolls I have ever had - very fishy tasting and honestly sloppy.I had an issue with the overall temperature of all the rolls - very warm and the avocado on the rolls was a mushy mess.   We must have read the menu wrong because we thought we were getting three unfried rolls and one fried but two ended up being over-fried almost to the point where they lost any of the delicateness of sushi. Lastly I am a big fan of wasabi and tend to add quite a bit to my low sodium soy, but they must have super-salty wasabi paste because it was almost inedible....and not spicy enough.   On a positive note the wooden boat displays were a really cool idea and certainly warranted us taking a few photos.   Overall though, the distance and quality make this a no-go for me ...",

The rolls are cheap/moderately priced, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is very homey.  The one thing that really stands out is the sushi chef's attention to detail and focus on ACTUALLY giving a dang about presentation. They're also relatively innovative with the rolls offered; my one friend had the Island Roll which was wrapped in cucumber strips rather than seaweed and rice. Pretty rad.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'll drop in here quite a bit whenever I'm in the area.",

Their other offerings, such as the Chicken and Crab Bento Box with a bunch of fixings, are excellent as well. Not one complaint or bad thing to say about their food.  The place is small but there always somewhere to sit. I love how the have the sushi chefs at the back wall of the restaurant so you can see all the stuff being made.  Great selection of different dishes if you're not into sushi and decent selection of standard Asian beers, wines and sake.  My only complaint is the wait time which is why they did not get the 5th start from me. It seems that every time I've gone it takes longer than usual to have our food delivered to the table. Not unreasonable but noticeably.  Aside from that you're gonna love this quaint little  place.",

This is on a Monday night.  That is a strong testament to how good this place is.  I was told there was a 20 minute wait.  I asked the hostess if I could place my sushi order so it would be ready when the table was ready and she said sure!!  She even brought drinks to us while we were waiting.  Our table was actually ready way quicker than she thought!  Our sushi took a while to come out because they were so busy!  Everything was delicious.  We devoured it quickly!  We ordered the valentine roll, the Christmas roll, and the favorite roll.   My favorite was the valentine roll.  I highly recommend New Zealand if you aren't in a rush for lunch/dinner.  The prices are also very reasonable.",

The tables were close to each other and it felt tight and loud.  But, as we got into our dining experience and a few people started clearing out, we started really liking the vibe. We both had the grilled Hibachi chicken and shrimp lunch special, which was very fairly priced. It was served in a Bento style box with rice, and a few small chicken skewers and a few fried triangular shaped spring rolls filled with cream cheese (and maybe some Crab meat), and some slaw.   I liked most of it, especially the chicken and shrimp.   The slaw was not my favorite, based on the heavy dressing on it.  A lot of people around us were ordering sushi. I am not a sushi fan, but it looked absolutely fabulous.  I wondered why the sanitation score was only 91.5.  I realize that is an A, but I like restaurants to have a 95 or higher. I know that I am not alone in this opinion.  Regardless, it was a great choice for our lunch date and I would recommend it.",

My only warning: if you dont like to wait for food (dine-in or carry out) this is not the place for you. But if you love authentic Japanese food, this is you place!!  Almost always, I order the miso soup and veggie tempura roll -- both satisfying and delicious. The deep flavor of the miso soup will not disappoint. Sometimes I get the rice & veggies, if I want a larger meal. The regular veggie sushi rolls are great, but occasionally they'll do a vegetarian-rice free roll that is AWESOMELY light & refreshing (though a wee bit ugly to eat, so dont order on a date night ;).  Love this place, just wish I didnt have to wait so long.",

The both times I've been here, we had to wait to be seated because it was busy and it stays busy (rightfully so because the food is so gooood). The restaurant is pretty small, cozy, and always packed with patrons so it takes the sushi chefs some time to get the sushi out. I can't complain though, their sushi is absolutely worth the wait!  I came with a party of 8-10 each time, and everyone just picked an order of sushi of their choice and then we all just dug in and shared. I've probably had 15+ different orders of their sushi and I can't complain about a single one! Their sushi ingredients are fresh and their rice is done right. Not only is their sushi DELISH, it's completely affordable and they're actually a pretty big size. The service has always been wonderful as well, the staff is so friendly and attentive.   In summary, New Zealand Cafe is hands down one of my favorite sushi joints in Charlotte. I don't want to go anywhere else for sushi! Love this place! I'd eat here every day if I could but I'd rather not see a huge spike of mercury levels in my body.",

    "text": "Been three times. Steadily worse each time. Not another chance. I expect frozen fish, this is Charlotte. I expect crowds, this place is tiny, and in a strip mall. I DON'T expect an hour to get 20 pieces of mediocre nigiri, even if it is on a nifty little boat. (Not sure how they are getting those CLEAN enough to eat off of, but hey, I don't work for the health department).   It took 30 minutes to get two of us in, and 10 to get in an order. 30 mintes later, still just a beer, nothing else. Others around us just keep getting fed, we just sit. Better yet, when I have the audacity to ask what's taking so long, the waitress gets huffy and kept blathering that nigiri takes longer to make. Gee, I've never eaten sushi before, please guide me sensei.  Just admit that you screwed up somewhere. Cut the BS. Don't keep coming by and making excuses AFTER 30 MINUTES, 45 mintues, an hour. Say something like it's on a slow boat...  30 minutes more, boat time. Ordered a small beer. Happy just to get my order in the end, but clearly some of it had been on the boat for some time. After saying so, one of the sushi chefs came out and apologized for the time taken and told me they would comp my second beer...so that's something, I suppose.  $3.50 for an hour sounds more Chinese than Japanese, but I digress. Two and a half hours I won't get back, and felt like a waste then and now, but maybe I can keep others from doing the same. In sum, save your money and keep looking for better, it HAS to be out there.",

I didn't get any sushi, but the sushi my companions ordered looked good (and it came out on a cool wooden boat!) I ordered the Queenstown's chicken entree which came with 2 fried shrimp, brown rice, 2 crab Rangoon patties. All that food for around 6 bucks! Great value! The chicken was crispy and battered then covered in sweet & sour sauce. It was really good. We were seated at a 4 person high-top as we arrived. The restaurant was kind of small, so I imagine it gets crowded quickly. Service was good, lunch was pretty cheap all around a great experience.",

We have waited for up to 1.5hrs and it was totally worth it.  We try to get there early.  The food quality is superb and the menu is extensive.  Plenty of options for the sushi fanatic.  Our kids started on Kani years ago and have graduated to more exotic and spicier rolls.  Of course they still love Kani lol.  Very high quality for reasonable prices.

Such as, the chef's are different and the prices increase because of whatever reason... It's just.. This place is perfect and I don't want anything to change. And plus, I don't want any more people to know about this place because this place can get packed real quick. I'm just joking... Sorta.  The sushi here is spectacular and at a reasonable price too. The quality of the sashimi is just incredible and especially for the price. It's a bang for your buck!! And for my non sushi lovers out there, the bento box is great also, really good portions.

When I walked in around lunchtime the other day, there were a good number of people in the small dining area, but there were quite a few tables open, so I was seated immediately.    Unfortunately, when I walked in, the place smelled fishy, not good. Based on the smell of the place, I was a bit worried about how fresh the sushi was, so I decided to pass on that.    Instead, I ordered a shrimp & chicken hibachi which was served \"bento box style\" with brown rice, salad, chicken skewers, and some sort of 'cheese-filled ravioli' (odd!).  The shrimp & chicken was ok, but was a bit too salty for my preference.  The brown rice was oddly flavored, a bit greasy, and cooked with corn or something odd like that mixed in (WTH?!). The chicken skewers consisted of 2 small skewers with oddly reddish looking chicken that was seriously dry & overcooked.  The cheese ravioli thingies were also odd tasting and not especially good. Sadly, the salad was drenched in some sort of yucky salad dressing.  Overall, I was very disappointed with the food.   On the plus side, the food was pretty cheap, and service was pretty good.  I just wish the quality & flavor of the food was better.",

    "text": "New Zealand Cafe came highly recommended by friends and neighbors around town. Labeled as \"a hidden gem of Charlotte,\" my expectations were set. I was ready to be wowed. I decided to make the 30 min trek out to Matthews to give this place a try. When I arrived, it was very crowded and we had a 30-45 min wait which seemed normal at a place with so much hype around it. Once we were seated, we ordered 2 rolls of sushi and toro nigiri. The sushi was very salty and had no flavor. I remained hopeful as we still had their infamous sushi boat on the way. Once the boat arrived, it was the same thing. Salty, no flavor, not fresh. This place was extremely disappointing. Not only was it under average sushi, it was the same price, if not more than some of the better sushi restaurants around Charlotte. New Zealand Cafe is great for people who are not regular sushi eaters. Anyone who knows good sushi, is better off going to Jade or Ru San's. Also, be prepared for the dining experience to take at least 2 hours (even on a Sunday).",

WOW - a great venue for sure. Very small - close in tables for couples and medium sized groups - lots of attentive waitrons - and a nice menu for any tastes. We went with three big rolls that did not disappoint. The house Vino Tinto was good for the price. Folks were cutting up and talking and having an all around good time. The food was good - fresh and tasteful - but everyone else around us was the cinch!",

    "text": "Stuck alone in a new city driving around looking for a place to enjoy my lunch hour, a sign caught my eye in a strip mall.  New Zealand?  My mind flashed back to my college trip to the Kiwi Isle.  Back then I was determined to eat something New Zealand other than the fruit.  Everytime I asked where a good \"New Zealand style\" restaurant would be I ended up directed to a mediocre Chinese buffet.  Sorry, New Zealanders that is from China; the Maoris did not invent General Tso's chicken.  Perhaps my culinary quest was at an end.  I pulled in to the boring suburban strip mall and 'Sushi bar' was stenciled on the windows underneath.  Slightly disappointed I decided to give it a whirl anyway, though a bit skeptical that sushi in a southern suburb might resemble that in a King of the Hill episode that was derived from canned tuna.  Opening the door however I delighted to see a very tastefully decorated and quaint interior with what looked to be actual Asians and not disguised Mexicans.  I, of course, tried the local Charlotte roll which was an Avocado on top style, my favorite.  It was delicious.  I'm quite pleased with my strip mall gem.  Update: Since eaten here around a dozen times.  I've tried tons of their specialty rolls.  My favorites were the: HOT Roll - jalapeno, spicy tuna, cream cheese! Ichiban Spicy Roll - Spicy Tuna, Crab, Avocado, red sauce Bombing Roll - Fried in mint leaf Wasabi Salmon Roll (w/ out mayo, eeg) - it's beautiful Rainbow Roll - Even more beautiful and delicious  Also, good is the fried banana 'sushi' (which is more than enough for one person), the red bean ice cream and the really good service.  It was a sad goodbye my last week there eating 5 times.  Thanks everyone there!",

I informed the lady we had 4 small kids and would be driving a good 25 miles to eat there so I wanted to see what the wait time was. She said they weren't too busy and it would only be about 10-15 minutes. We immediately left and drove the 25 miles and when we pulled up we noticed a huge crowd outside. I called the lady again and she again informed me it wasn't too crowded and would only be about a 15 minute wait. We got our kids out and got inside, and the hostess at the front said oh no the wait would be an hour or more. I said what? We just spoke with a lady and she told me differently. She said oh I'll have to let her know it's longer. They were very unsympathetic and could care less that we had 4 hungry kids and just drove 25 plus miles to only get turned around and find another place to eat! I am very appalled by how their customer service was and the lack of sympathy or apology. I will NEVER eat here. I understand we came on a Friday night, but all they had to do was tell us the real wait time and there would have been no issues! No matter how good a place may be, if there customer service is bad, it ruins their whole business!",

It was our 3rd Anniversay and my 27th birthday so we hit up a few places in Charlotte and we were not disappointed. After we checked out of the Sierra Hotel (which I will be reviewing in a lil' bit) the hubs took me to New Zealand Cafe for lunch. It's off North Sardis road in a strip mall type setting.  I was really excited to be having lunch here b/c all the sushi buffs I know have been saying this is the best sushi in Charlotte. AND THEY WEREN'T LIEING! At first glance I didn't know what to make of the decor, it's a hodge-podge of japanese design/nautical elements/viking-esque wall art. But I wasn't here for the decor, I wanted to inhale some SUSHI! We were greeted instantly and told to grab a seat, so we sat near the door as everywhere else was taken. I can't remember the name of our server, but she was very petite and wore a big smile. She took our drink order and handed us three different menus. The hubs told her it was my birthday and with that she smiled and said, \"Oooh you get a free meal today!\" I was estatic, I showed her my DL and she pointed out what I could order for free. I chose the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp platter, I also ordered a Sweet Dragon Roll and the hubs ordered a Rainbow Roll.  It took about 10 minutes and I was in Sushi heaven...the sweet dragon roll was perfect dipped in my concoction of soy sauce, wasabi and mayo dipping sauce. Now on to the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp platter that came out in a cute little tray. It was an assortment of crab-n-creme cheese wontons, chicken on a stick, broccoli, onions. zuchini and of course shrimp and chicken. It was sooo good! The sushi was so fresh, you could tell they use the best ingredients. The portion was the perfect size although I could not finish the entire roll but the hubs was on hand to polish off what I couldn't.  All-in-all, New Zealand Cafe gets five stars for it's friendly servers, mom and pop feel and quality sushi! :-)",

The person who answered the phone took the time to search through their records to find it for me.  She was going to fax it to me, but their fax could not dial a long distance number, so the owner faxed it to me from her home fax at 1:30 AM that night when she got home.  I don't know many restaurants who would put that kind of effort into helping a one-time customer.  However, if I ever am back in Charlotte, I will be going back!",

Had some steamed pot stickers for an appetizer and while good, they could use a bit more flavor. Then ordered 4 rolls, most recommended, and they came out on a funky boat which was cool. They tuna crunchy roll was way too hot and fried for my taste. My favorite roll was the pink roll and would order it again and again. Ichiban and Dynamite roll were good too, though the Ichiban could have used something extra.   All in all, the price is hard to beat and I will try it again when I'm in the area and try a few different rolls.",

    "text": "New Zealand Cafe is a treasure hidden in an old strip mall.  The food is good and inexpensive -- a great combination, in my book.  Sushi is one of those things I am always hesitant to order (although I usually enjoy it once I do), so I have yet to try any of NZC's offerings in that area.  However, their bento-box esque dinners are delicious.  For $6-10, depending on your selection, you get the main entree, two chicken skewers, two crab rangoons, rice, and a salad.  It's hard to beat that value, especially when it tastes so good.  I especially recommend the Fantasy Shrimp (with a unique, delicious fruity mayonnaise sauce) or the Crispy Scallops.  The only reason I New Zealand Cafe doesn't get 5 stars is because the inside is cramped, which means that the lines can be long and the dining crowded if you don't feel like take out.",

Very tasty chicken (along with sesame noodles, salad, shrimp, and crab rangoon).  Bento box was a winner as well...the sushi was fabulous and fresh.  First time had the NZ white wine, second time the Kikkoman plum wine. The NZ was especially nice with the mango chicken.   Eclectic mixture of people both times. I love the mood at this place.

    "text": "I am not sure where all of the 5 and 4 star reviews are coming from in regards to New Zealand Cafe.  We were told to try this restaurant by numerous people when we moved to the area, they told us it was the best sushi in Charlotte and that we would love it because we love sushi so much.  We tried it two different times, on two different days to be sure of our opinion.  It is not good.  Definitely not the best in Charlotte, or in the area for that matter.  The sushi is huge, HUGE. It is a serious challenge to eat without falling completely apart.  Most of the sushi is rice, not a lot of fish going on.  The salmon was good but the tuna tasted off so we didn't even finish those rolls that had tuna in them.  The restaurant is tiny. We were sat no more than a foot from the people on either side of us, so their conversations were basically our conversations the entire time. We did sit outside the first time but with people waiting it was kind of awkward to have people hovering over us while trying to enjoy the over-riced-over-sized bland sushi.  Other reviewers have mentioned it tastes like grocery sushi, that I agree with.  Maybe the prices draw people in and that's why they think it's great.  Most of the rolls are fried in some way, which is probably necessary because some of the fish simply was not fresh and we could not continue eating it.  The service was not great either time we went, if they change things, perhaps we will try it again, until then, on to the much much better sushi Charlotte has to offer!",

    "text": "This was a little bit out of the way for me, but it was worth the drive. It's a cute little place, and I mean little--it probably seats 40 if all the tables are full. If there is a wait you have to stand outside, which is not so great on a chilly night. Despite the small size and large number of people waiting for tables, it only took about 10 minutes for us to get a table. This might have been because we were just 2, but they do seem to turn over tables efficiently.  In terms of food, the sushi was fantastic and reasonably priced. They have a tempura vegetable roll, which is a welcome change to the \"typical\" veggie sushi rolls that involve some combination of avocado, cucumber, asparagus, and carrots. They also have fried tofu nigiri, which is one of my favorites. The rest of the menu isn't super vegetarian-friendly, but there are a couple of options.  I will definitely be visiting again!",

The prices are well price, quality is good, sushi is good and you will not leave being disappointed if you are a sushi lover!  The only downfall is that this place is so tiny, it only holds about 40 people. So if you go during dinner time there is usually a 20-60 minute wait. I like to go during lunch hour or before the dinner rush. But there has been time where I've waited for over an hour to get a seat.

We made it there just in time on a Sunday evening so that we didn't have to wait for a table and started things off with some edamame and a couple sushi rolls.  The edamame was extra salty (just how I like it) and the sushi was delish!  I ordered the Trio Special as an entree (I think that was the name).  It consisted of chicken, beef and shrimp in a spicy brown sauce along with your choice of brown rice or garlic noodles.  It is served with a small salad, with what seem to be a watered down shrimp sauce as the dressing, two crab ragoons, and two small chicken skewers.  All for $6.95, are you kidding me?  The service was excellent I considered deducting a star because the place is so small, but hey, I like it like that.  I had a to go box that did not survive very long and as others have mentioned the leftovers were awesome!  I definately recommend you check this place out and you can get out real cheap if you skip the apps/sushi/alcohol.",

Jackie is the man at making mind blowing sushi creations. Don't let the strip mall that this place is located in or the size of New Zealand Cafe deter you. All the people you'll see waiting for a table should be a good indication of just how good this sushi is. If you don't want to wait for a table I would highly recommend going early (before 6:30) or later (around 8:30). It is definitely worth your time to experience some of the best sushi around these parts!",

Then we shared 3 rolls: the Master Roll, the Sweet Dragon Roll, and the Lobster King roll. All were good, but nothing really blew us away. We agreed the Sweet Dragon was our least favorite, but we were split on our favorite of the three. Service was friendly, and took an average amount of time for everything. I would chalk this up as a good place when you don't want to travel far for sushi, but I've had better sushi in Charlotte.",

Almost nobody in the restaurant had food, yet it seemed that there was a steady flow of take out orders going out. This is not the first time this has happened while I've been here either. I guess I'll never understand why they don't suspend take-out orders while there are lots of tables sitting with NO FOOD for extended periods of time. That said, the sushi is great and the price is fantastic. I'll stick with going for lunch in the future.",

Food was great and fresh and the prices were even better!   On our second visit last week, we decided to eat in. We went early assuming there would be a wait, but seeing as though it was rush hour on a rainy night, we got seated right away! How lucky! From reading reviews, we assumed we would have to wait awhile.   For an app we got the crab ravioli which was essentially a crab rangoon, which were great. Since I am pregnant, I got a couple cooked sushi rolls with eel, and I hardly missed the regular fish rolls, because they were really good. My husband got a few pieces of sushi as well as a few rolls and he really enjoyed his.   The prices here are great, the servers are very attentive, making sure you always have a glass of water or whatever you are drinking as well as checking in to make sure everything is going well. Luckily for us, we got to sit at a high top, but since the place is small, the lower seats are pretty close together, but it is so worth it!  The way we look at it is, you know you are getting fresh quality fish if the place is always busy! Lots of turn over of inventory which is a good thing!",

So disappointing.   Edited to add on 8/8/18: we wanted to try this place again as the sushi is so good, but disappointed to see that they still care far more for the to go orders than the diners. We've been waiting over a half an hour. 5 of the tables still have no food but the to go order folks keep coming and going with HUGE containers. So disappointing.",

New Zealand breaks the mold, driving up you figure it's a standard, lower end poor quality place....once you are served you realize it's quite the opposite.  I came to New Zealand on a recommendation from a co worker who, so far, hasn't let me down.  Lunch time on a Saturday I walked in and saw a cramped space bustling with activity.  A huge party and everyone smiling.  They handed me 3 different menus and when they were opened I was impressed at the selection.  My Daughter who has celiac was with me and upon telling the server he gave me comfort that they would take care of her, and when then brought the bottle of gluten free tamari I was sold!    I started out with the shrimp soup.  It took a bit to arrive but it was worth the wait.  Broth had these fried onion things which gave it such a great flavor and it was a perfect start to an amazing meal.  I had the Tom Roll which was fresh, and when I say fresh you can tell they take pride and judging by the amount of sushi coming out of the kitchen nothing there lasts long.  The roll was hearty and well done and I smiled while eating it knowing I had a new place for sushi.  My daughter had a special California roll and was happy with what she received.    New Zealand may need to expand soon as it was packed and people were waiting outside.  The staff was friendly knowledgeable and the guys rolling sushi didn't stop the whole time I was there.  Not sure what level I have to order so that I can get my meal served on one of those huge sushi boats but I'm doing it next time, I swear.  New Zealand, I love you and will be back soon with friends......",

Can also call your order in and walk to the back sushi counter for pick up. The restaurant is very small and cramped. Are usually go with the vegetable tempura roll or the chicken fried rice. Love the vegetable tempura roll because it gives you a variety of vegetables inside of the role. Are usually ask for mine with teriyaki sauce And spicy mayo on top.Prices are very reasonable. If you haven't checked this spot out in Matthews area you need to!",

Between the very reasonable prices, huge selection, and wonderful flavors coming from the sushi bar... you'd be hard-pressed to find a better place. We ordered a few pieces of Nigiri, and three rolls (One came separately and has already been polished off in the photo) but they put the rest on the boat which was really kind a cool. All the good things you've read about New Zealand Cafe are True. Go, hit the scene, eat sushi.",

We had some sushi for appetizer and it was so yummy. I tried sea urchin for the first time. Lol. I ordered the crunchy scallop and shrimp, my boyfriend ordered the salmon. Both dishes came out like bento style. Chicken on a stick, crab Rangoon, rice, salad, and entree. Also came with sweet and sour sauce and shrimp sauce! Ordered the plum wine and it was tasty. The servers here help each other and they were all very nice and attentive. The sushi chefs were nice and talkative, I was so amazed with all the sushi boats! Definitely will be coming back here again. I will recommend this place",

And it is always worth the wait!! We order sushi for our at-home date nights, every time we have something to celebrate, and whenever we have had a rough time of things and need comfort food. Besides my husband, this is the only number I have on speed dial! There are a TON of other sushi options in Charlotte, but none will measure up!",

It is nowhere on my daily travels and I had not returned until today.  Yes, the place is quaint, but only three tables were occupied on this evening during a drenching thunderstorm.  In any case, I stopped in today for sushi and ordered:  1. Vegetable tempura (deep fried sweet potato (MY FAV!), zucchini, broccoli and potato) 2.  Favorite Roll (crispy jumbo shrimp, spicy snow crab, avocado soybean paper with a spicy flavored mayo sauce) 3. Chicken tempura  The sushi was fantastic!  I am a sweet potato lover, so the vegetable tempura with a bit of crunch was delicious (am I partial?...yes!).  The chicken tempura was good, and my favorite seafood roll was pretty darn good as well!  I will be back very soon to give it  another try.  Oh, and I also had Miso soup.  I have read of its 'healing' properties so I wanted to give it a try.  Oddly enough, my visit was Monday and I was pretty sick and stuffy on Tuesday :(  Maybe just a coincidence...    If you haven't visited the restaurant in a long while, give them another try. Perhaps the sushi chef has changed.  If not, my taste buds have changed for the better!",

We were both very far from being impressed. This was obviously not the freshest stuff...I luv sushi. I eat an awful lot of it, including on the boat with the Tuna's heart still beating (cant get better/fresher then that)  While not impressed at all, we gave it a 2nd shot. Went with another couple. All agreed it was not fresh with none of us impressed in the slightest.  But I guess we should be thankful that only 3 of the 4 of us got sick. Very sick. The only one who didnt get sick also loves sushi and after our extensive meal arrived, and being the expert he is, he chose to not even attempt to try it and ordered a chicken meal. While he wasnt impressed with it either, it was at least edible and he was the only one who didnt get violently ill.   There will not be a third visit.",

He has all of the qualities you would want in a lover: family-oriented, charming, comforting, original and dependable with a little unpredictable spice. He is simple, but knows all the way to please your palate. What more could a girl ask for?  I've sampled bits and pieces of the entire menu, but truly it is the sushi that retains me an addict, yearning for more. Despite the frequency of my visits, I still to this day have a hard time narrowing down conclusive favorites. There are so many innovative and delicious rolls on the menu that it always takes me the time length of 3 waiter/waitress visits before I decide. I do have one roll that I simply can not live without and that is the Century Roll! It comes with 8 pieces and 4 different \"toppings\" (2 tuna, 2 scallops, 2 crab, 2 octopus). The scallop pieces are what I live for! I also LOVE the Wasabi Salmon roll. It comes with this wasabi sauce that is creamy and oh so delicious! Plus, they have a $1 Nigiri/Sashimi menu! I recommend the spicy scallop, salmon, yellowtail and quail egg sashimi. They literally melt in your mouth because it's so fresh!  This is by far, one of the best gems in my treasure chest!",

Don't let the fake plants and cramped dining room scare you off. The food is at least fifty percent better than you would think.  Service can be a bit slow so grab an app. Rolls are fresh, varied (tons of non-fried options) and affordable. Four rolls at dinner with beers ran us about $37 before tax and tip. This is a great spot for affordable sushi or try the bento box for a little bit of everything.  I wish they had more outdoor seating -only two tables- but this place is the only place in the area with quality sushi. It is packed for a reason.",

It's a little bit of a drive to get here from where I live but it was well worth the trip.  My friend and I came here on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. No surprise there, but the wait was only 20-30 minutes which went by fast. Their venue is relatively small and the ambience isn't as nice as say O-ku or Sushi Guru but don't let that deter you.  After we sat down, our server was exceptionally helpful and kind to helping us order and get situated. We went with the General Spicy, Red Dragon, Wasabi Salmon, and Big Boss Rolls. They were all so delicious and very well-priced. The Big Boss Roll was both of our favorites. I also ordered an 8 Oz craft of Sake for only $6.95. They even presented our rolls to us on a sushi boat which you can find in all the Yelp pictures. It was a cool and neat little bonus. It was so much food that my friend and I could barely finish it. Our bill together came out to be only $50 which we thought was a great deal.  I highly recommend this place and would definitely come back, even with it being on the other side of town!",

Better yet, the rolls were better designed this time...meaning, more insta-friendly photogenic!  It'll be hard for me to NOT order this yet again on my next visit, but I need to try some of their other fancy schmancy sushi rolls. Given how they have pictured menu of their specialties rolls, this place is ideal for Sushi Newbies. Honestly, there's at least half dozen that I'd like to try. Their Bento Boxes look quite good too.  Given that it's Friday, it was super packed when we arrived...so we had to wait at least 15 minutes for our table...but the food was well worth it.  I do wish this place was a tad bigger. Felt a bit claustrophobic with so many people squeezed in. Somewhat muggy too, but I noticed that they did yank up the A/C halfway thru our meals.  Still, this place makes amazing sushi rolls at super-affordable pricing, so the worst I can give it is 4 stars. Definitely plan on returning!",

    "text": "If you are looking for good quality sushi and affordable this is the place to go. It is a tiny restaurant, and it always gets packed. My recommendation will be to get there early that way you don't have to wait outside for the longest. The rolls are big and filling. I like it because they put a good amount of seafood and not just rice. They also have hot dishes, but to be honest I only have the sushi since it's really good. My boyfriend and me always get 5 rolls and we share, so it ends up being 2 1/5 rolls each. It's the perfect amount if you are really hungry which I always am hungry lol.   My favorite rolls are the general spicy roll the, the rainbow roll, the wasabi spicy roll, and the big boss roll. I have tried more but these were the ones I remember from my last visit.   I totally recommend this place. It's a drive to get to matthews, but I rather do that than to not hit the sushi craving the proper way. Go check it out! Don't forgot to check their times out, so you can go early.",

The quality of the fish is good, the portion is generous, quantity of fish is average, and the best part is, the price point. This place is 40% less than the sushi places in downtown (think of Yamazaru and Pisces) and it's 20% less than your average sushi restaurants. They are constantly slammed and the tables are close to reach other at a somewhat uncomfortable way. IDK if they take reservations but I highly recommend to make one when possible! I had the chirashi bowl which wasn't on the menu but it was $14 for a nice sized entree and a side of amaebi nigiri, which I would not recommend, as it was below average",

    "text": "About the only fish they don't serve here is sardine, however, if you visit at lunch or at dinner during peak hours, and can score a table, you will definitely feel like one. In fact, it's quite amazing how many diners they can fit in such a small space, so much so, that you have to walk single file to and from the restroom and in between the three rows of tightly packed tables.There's a reason for this however, which is everything, especially the sushi dishes, is exceptionally fresh, delicious and affordable. As far as its tiny size goes, that becomes part of its charm.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night, and waited only about 15 minutes before being wedged into... that is, seated at... our table for two in the middle row of square tables. (Quick Tip#1: Wait however much longer neccessary for a high top table along each wall - you'll quickly see why.) We left at 8:00 and there was still about ten people waiting for tables and the two sushi ninja chefs were still coolly and methodically churning out order after order of artistic sushi creations.  I ordered the Teriyaki Salmon Bento Box for $12.95. It contained a good-sized portion of tender salmon, four pieces of California roll, tempura shrimp, brocolli, sweet potato and zucchini, a small salad with ginger dressing and steamed rice. I enjoyed every bite but I didn't stop there. How could I when they also offer sushi at $1 a piece? I chose the red snapper, baby octupus (I know, how cruel), mackeral, fish roe and salmon. Loved it all! Did I mention it was only a buck apiece?!  My wife ordered the fried seafood roll which turned out to be my favorite and the Alaskan King crab roll. They ran $6.95 each, which was about half of what our Ballantyne area sushi joints would charge. With two sodas and tip, our total bill was $45.  Service was friendly and attentive and sanitation score was a 94. It's not quite five stars but it is a Gotta Try in my book!",

    "text": "They have a wide variety of options for great prices, but the venue is very small. We were seated next to another couple and were so close in proximity that we could hear their every word, and I'm sure they could hear ours as well. It was not intentional eavesdropping, we simply had no choice. We could not have a conversation to ourselves, nor could we be comfortably seated without constantly being bumped into. It was like being seated in an airplane.   I ordered the Atlantic Seafood Platter (shrimp, scallops, and exactly ONE small piece of lobster meat with a mix of broccoli, carrots, and zucchini). It came with the house salad, 2 crab rangoons, lo mein, and 2 chicken skewers for $9.50. The noodles were supposed to be garlic noodles, but I could not taste any garlic at all. The main menu (not the sushi menu) makes this place sound like an American restaurant rather than an Asian restaurant, but the food was still prepared in the Asian style and was presented in a bento box. I was disappointed with the small amount of seafood that I received because the menu gave the impression that the seafood would be the star of the meal, but it did not stand out.  I also had the Crunch Roll Max (6 rolls of deep fried salmon, sea bass, tuna, crispy crunch, avocado, smelt roe, and spicy mayo, $6.95) and Crab Cream Cheese Avocado Roll (8 rolls for $4.25). I enjoyed the sushi more than my entree.  This place needs to create a better arrangement for the seating to avoid being so cramped and to also make alterations to the menu description and/or presentation of the main course items to better reflect what the customer should expect. It was also irritating that not only did they refuse to honor their birthday special on the night before my birthday, but they also told me to return the following day in order to receive my free birthday meal. The waitress had stated this with such disregard, and then merely walked away. If it wasn't for the sushi and prices, I'd give this place a lower rating.",

We were told the wait would be 30-40 minutes but it was really just about an hour. The restaurants has about 8-10 chairs for patrons waiting to be seated spread between the back hallway and the front of the restaurant. We chose to walk around Harris Teeter and then sit in our car because it was standing room only and there wasn't much room left. This is how you know it must be good!   Once we were seated our waitress came up and offered beverages and I asked for a pen to mark our choices. We took about 10 minutes to go through all of the menus they provide and decided to order the tuna taco, seafood salad, unagi (eel), and a platter that included 9 pieces of sashimi and 6 pieces of nigiri as well as a salad/soup and a tuna roll. We added two rolls to try some unique rolls out and I wish we hadn't because there was so much food!!   Everything came out pretty fast and the fist as be right there! Fresh. One roll was supposed to be spicy and didn't live up to our expectations. Everything else was great! I was a bit upset that I ate a piece of shrimp with the tail removed to find that there were remnants of the shell that I then had to chew and swallow (because you can't spit things out in public right??), but other than that we had a great experience.  The price is definitely lower than other places in Charlotte and the value and freshness is elevated! For all of what I listed above plus a glass of KJ chardonnay and a Sam Adam's our bill came to $70 before tip. I find that pretty reasonable considering we left STUFFED. Next time I would order a few things at a time to gauge my fullness better. I would definitely recommend NZC.",

Arrived on a Saturday night around 7pm - likely not the smartest as the wait was an hour (the restaurant was small)..... but in hindsight it was definitely worth it.   I was seated as a party of 2 in front of the sushi bar. Most people probably would have preferred a table, but I didn't mind, as I was able to watch the sushi chefs in action!   When my sushi arrived, I was delighted as my Valentine Roll, not only came out in the shape of a heart, but was so tasty! I ordered a few simple maki rolls but would say that the speciality rolls were better and only about $9 max.   Compared to other sushi restaurants in Charlotte, New Zealand definitely ranks near top of the list. All of the rolls are very affordable priced and taste great.   Also a plus - this place has ample parking.",

The tuna was delicious!!! The sushi was fresh and yummy and comes in a cool display boat!    I think there are fancier sushi restaurants in the area but this place had good flavors & good service!  It can get crowded at lunch time. It is in a shopping plaza so look for the sign near Harris Teeter.   In prior visits I tried the Dancing eel Roll & Charlotte roll on different trips here and had fresh flavors both times.",

We arrived at the restaurant 22 minutes after we called. Once we paid for the order we were told it would be ready in 10 minutes. The order after that was not ready for an additional 20 minutes. The food was awesome and staff was very pleasant. Make sure if you are calling in your order, give them plenty of time to complete it (20 minutes is really 40 minutes). Even with the long wait, I would recommend this restaurant to others.",

Sushi & sashimi combo is a good deal. 9 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of sushi and tuna roll. Also it comes with either salad or miso soup. The fish was so fresh. It is important to choose a popular sushi restaurant if you want to have fresh food lol The service was good but the order was a little behind at the beginning. Didn't like the $1 sushi. The tamago and little octopus sushi were too cold. Definitely want to try different rolls next time. But I am not sure if I can wait for an hour to try those. I'd rather visit during slow hours.",

Really odd atmosphere, but tons of delicious food. It will take you 10 minutes to read the menu and decide. It's extensive!! Sushi, teriyaki, stir fry, vegetarian, seafood, beef, chicken, platter...holy cow!!! We do a LOT of takeout. Best fried rice in town.

We were a two top and were sat next to another two top where the guy talked non-stop about BS the entire time we were trying to enjoy dinner... the BF is the one who eats sushi, I do not (in fact I eat no seafood except the canned tuna)... he orderede the H.O.T. roll, he was in heaven... he convinced me to try and it was amazing. It was lightly battered and fried and had tuna, I think jalapenos too, I liked that it was slightly warm? I ordered the mango chicken with garlic noodles... the dish came with fried shrimp (BF ate and I asked if he liked and got an mmmhmmm) crab and creamcheese fried thingies (I ate one not a lot of filling but it tasted good, BF said it was decent)... the salad was bleh, cruddy bagged iceburg lettuce with some dressing, I passed. Garlic noodles super good and the mango chicken had really good flavor and a lot of peppers, onions and mangos in it, I perfected it with some hot sauce and ate away. BF had some other wasabi roll and he said that was really good as well. I would definately go back and try something different, I was eyeing the steak and pork chops but figured Id check out the chicken first. I think it would be a good place to order take out and I am looking forward to bringing my brother when he visits.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places in Charlotte, my personal choice for quality food and sushi at a cheap price, and I bring all out-of-town visitors here.  While their special rolls may be priced in the $10-13 range, standard rolls like spicy tuna run about $4, and my personal favorite, the Super Spicy Roll is $6.    If you're in the mood for more filling fare, the bento boxes are the way to go, as they come with entree, salad, rice/noodles, and a small side item - all for $6.  My favorite is the Thai Curry Chicken, but I have tried almost all entrees on the menu and haven't been disappointed.    My only complaint is that this place is small, with only 10-12 tables, so there is almost always a wait.  and, when they are particularly busy, it can be a little while before your food comes out.  but it is worth the wait, and like someone said before - thats a perfect time for a beer.",

A friend of ours who had discovered this sushi heaven decided to take us Charlotte newbies for a real sushi treat. Coming from NYC where good Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen....I was a bit skeptical. I mean there isn't a True shoreline here in Charlotte. How fresh can the seafood really get? very very fresh is the answer. The restaurant itself is very homey and the service is always polite and fast. The sushi chefs themselves are a bit very slow. Probably because its a father son duo doing their thing. But the wait is worth it. We ordered like 8 rolls and the 3 of us ate and ate till we couldn't eat anymore. the menu is extensive and well priced. But the sauces were the real winners for me. Most of the specialty sushi rolls come with this amazing spicy sauces and they are just divine. I didn't care for the rolls with roe in it because it was a bit too fishy for me. But the rest of the rolls were rocking ;o) Definite try for all sushi snobs and sushi virgins too :o)",

This is the first place in Charlotte that I have actually really liked their food, as far as sushi goes that is. When you do go there, know that you will be sitting very close to other patrons and will be able to hear what everyone is talking about in the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and accommodating towards odd orders which is nice. The Spicy Mayo is very Mayoie or however you spell that word. Go there on your Birthday and you will get a free meal, 21 and over and make sure you bring your ID. I recommend this place as long as your in the area. I will be going back!",

And no, I'm not sure why it's called New Zealand, as it's clearly a sushi joint...but it's a GOOD sushi joint, and the prices are really good. I've eaten at a few sushi places around Charlotte, and New Zealand is one of my favorites.  I might not be the best sushi evaluator, as I won't eat anything that had a mother. However, I've never eaten anything bad at New Zealand, and I've frequented the place with pleased meat eaters several times.   My favorites are the seaweed salad and the edamame. They've got some interesting desserts, like the red bean and green tea ice cream. I kind of like the tall tables, too...  One day, I'm going to order one of those giant sushi boats!",

Their crab ragoons which they call crab cheese raviolli is disappointing and lacks flavor as well as substance. But if your looking for take out sushi this is your place, you can stay and eat but they are usually pretty busy and are tucked in a small space in a strip mall off monroe rd. and can get loud and crowded.",

    "text": "The name, New Zealand Cafe, is quite misleading. We've never been to New Zealand (the country), and are not at all familiar with its cuisine. We also would not consider it a \"cafe\" per se. Overlook the name and get yourself to New Zealand Cafe at your very first opportunity. A very pleasant surprise awaits you. This is a real deal Japanese establishment. The centerpiece, at least for us, is the sushi bar although table seating is available along with an array of traditional non-sushi menu offerings. We go there for sushi alone, at the sushi bar, and have yet to take a table. I must mention that the sushi bar only seats 5, so you may have to wait during peak periods. Believe me, the wait will be totally worth it. If you are rushed or impatient, fret not, all sushi bar offerings are also served table-side.  Jackie, the owner and Chief Itamae, is an incredibly warm and engaging person. He's also very focused and most passionate about his establishment and delivers outstanding sushi, from his hands to your palate. His assistants are trained by him and he keeps a gentle watch over them, ensuring that we, his patrons, receive top quality at all times. We've been there in his absence, and the quality doesn't falter. His persona, however, is missed on those rare occasions.  We typically order a diverse variety of sushi and sashimi, so much so that it's served to us in a large wooden \"boat\" - an artfully tasteful and traditional Japanese presentation that never fails to garner the awe of fellow patrons. Our favorites include: Toro, Mackerel, Yellowtail, Albacore, Scallops (both regular and spicy), Uni with optional Quail Egg, Flying Fish Row with optional Quail Egg, Eel, and Baby Octopus. As starters for us, the Calamari Tempura, Spicy Tuna Roll, Crab and Shrimp Roll, Salmon Skin Roll and Tuna Tartare are all excellent.  I've eaten sushi around the globe regularly for 40 years, know it well, and can attest without reservation that New Zealand Cafe offers the very best sushi in Charlotte, NC. Just take a look at the numerous awards and proclamations proudly displayed on the wall behind the sushi bar.  What are you waiting for??? Go there, NOW!!!",

It is some of the best sushi we have ever had at prices half as much as most other restaurants ($7-11 for a roll versus $12-16 elsewhere, for example). With that being said, we no longer actually eat at NZ Cafe. The restaurant is TINY. As in, I hope you want to have dinner with the strangers sitting next to you because you'll be on top of them and vice versa. Also, with only a few tables in the restaurant (maybe 10 tops), on busy weekend nights you might find yourself waiting for up to an hour. Once you're seated, the service is typically great (friendly, cordial) albeit slow as molasses so don't expect this to be a quick trip. One dine-in experience took about two and a half hours from start to finish.  As a result of the less than stellar dine-in experience, my fiance and I order takeout regularly instead. We call ahead (well before we are hungry because take-out can take a while, too) and pick up our sushi to enjoy at home. They have a nice variety and it is great quality as well. I would highly recommend this place for sushi takeout any day.",

We split 7 rolls between the 4 of us and it was a TON of food. They even brought it out in a boat (ok, ok, we requested the boat because eating a ton of sushi out of a boat is just so much cooler than on a plate!!). We ordered the cilantro roll, valentine roll, dynamite roll, sweet dragon roll, wasabi roll, christmas roll, and volcano roll. All were absolutely delish! My favorites were the cilantro roll (just super refreshing and light....loved the lemon on top) and the valentine roll (soy paper and shaped like a heart!) No man was left behind on our boat!  Prices were very good. I think the final bill was a little under $40 a couple for all those rolls.  Just a note, this place is very very small. So, I would come early or later to avoid waiting for a table. We live in Uptown, so it is a hike to get to New Zealand. However, I think it'll be worth the drive when my next sushi craving comes around!",

Sashimi was good although slices were a bit small, and I prefer mine to be very cold.  Normally sashimi comes in 3 pieces per order and these were 1 per.  Rolls were excellent.  Everyone liked it and for where it is it was a nice surprise.  Again I prefer my sushi colder but it was tasty.    Would definitely go back to try some other things.",

We waited about an hour for a table and when we finally got a table we waited another 15 minutes just to order our drinks and food since we looked at the menu outside. Appetizers came around 25 minutes in and the sushi started coming around an hour later. In all the food was great we had grab ragoons and all sorts of sushi from the charlotte roll, philly roll, spicy salmon, wasabi roll and so on we also had the family chicken with veggies and brown rice which was the last thing served to us and 5 minutes later we got the check which was not very pleasing. They took a very long time getting our receipts back which was about 10 minutes. It was a good place for food but if you're in a hurry I don't recommend it.",

My boyfriend, and avid sushi lover said they had the best sushi he has had in Charlotte. I enjoyed their lobster roll, the ingredients were fresh, the food well made and presented beautifully. Not a great place if your in a hurry or dislike crowds, but for good food at good prices, it can't be beat.",

    "text": "I've been going to New Zealand Cafe since they opened.  (Can anyone remember when it was a Sub Dudes? Yea.. Still amazed at how much of the decor they kept--but I digress.)  New Zealand Cafe makes you think you're going to be eating Kiwi foods, but you're not.  I still don't quite understand the connection in that light but it is what it is.  Now if you're looking for a great and fair priced Bento Box, Sushi, or a spread of menu items that are all quite tasty and again well priced then you are in for a treat.  We've roamed the menu over the last few years and while I often get Sashimi bentos or some collection of Sushi rolls, when I am hungry I'll grab a roll and a entree and still feel like I made out great.  The service is interesting; sometimes we feel like we're coming home--sometimes we feel like we need to wave for a glass of water.  Just go with a bit of room in your flexibility for service.  This also includes patience.  This place has got to be no larger than 800sqft of sitting space which translates into a waiting game if you go any time near dining hours.  We will always go early, or go late, but never go during dinner rush.  If you don't like waiting, and you really need to be doted upon there are many places in Charlotte that will charge you waaaay waaay waaay more for the same quality of food.  I'd rather afford a healthy amount of great food than pay for a store owners overhead.  You're going to have to make that choice.  So if you want some great sushi and bento combos head on over.  Hell you even get a free meal on your birthday--now that rocks.",

New Zealand Cafe is a tiny parcel in a crowded strip mall that is serving incredible Kiwi-inspired Japanese dishes at amazing prices. The bento box is by far the best deal. It's all from the grill (instead of the customary sushi), but you get an unbelievable amount of tasty food for about $10.  Speaking of sushi, they work wonders. They have a sushi bar, where you can dine in front of the chefs and watch them work - their grace and elegance is worth the visit.  Do be advised that take-out is usually be best option. It's very small and quite \"cozy\" inside - if you have one of the low, square tables in the middle, odds are good you'll get to know your neighbors.  Don't let that deter you though - great Asian-fusion at the Galleria!",

I would have gladly had just one, but our friends couldn't make a decision between some of their favorites, and then we happened to score a free roll because of a birthday in the group (a banana concoction of some sort that I keep thinking about, days later- super creative and delicious). No rolls left. Every morsel of rice gone.   I also appreciated the presentation aspect of this place. The sushi looked incredible- like something you'd find at a much more expensive and upscale restaurant. They also use these large bamboo boats to serve the larger orders on. Apparently that's a \"thing\", but I've never seen or heard of it. Nice touch.   New favorite sushi in Charlotte. No contest.",

You feel like family when you come in. You can tell they truly appreciate your business.  It's only flaw, it's located in a strip mall and is very small. Seating is limited and the wait can be long depending on when get there.   You can never go wrong with takeout.",

The restaurant itself is small with just a few tables and decor that might not really make sense. But I'm not here to look at the walls, I'm here to mow down on some sushi...correct?! Correct!  Please try the Poke, it's delicious, and I love the lemon they turn into a snail with their garnish artistry. Eat this, and you won't be disappointed.  Normally I get 2 rolls, usually with eel or shrimp, those are my favorite types of rolls. Sweet Dragon is good, and if you like spicy for for Spicy Dragon. Take some time to try the single Nigri pieces too!  Can't have rice????? That's okay, there are 5-6 rice-less rolls on the menu. Try Bamboo Roll ..............................................$ 10.95 Red snapper, tuna, salmon, flying fish roe, scallion  wrapped with thin sliced cucumber & ponzi sauce  While sometimes there can be a line out the door due to is uber goodness and small seating area I will always come back to NZ Cafe!",

I noticed they do a heavy amount of take out and people were complaining  about their takeout orders taking over an hour.  Management needs to get a new business plan in place because if they don't this place will lose its popularity and close down.",

We waited almost an hour to be seated on Tuesday night, after our order, we had to wait another 20 mins. I ordered the bento box which was supposed to come with a california roll. Everything was overfried, chicken was bland and the california roll was pitiful and tiny and looked like it was made by a 5 year old. I couldnt even call it a sushi.  We decided to get a take out couple days ago, figured we's skip the wait this time. We ordered the season platter which was supposed to come with postickers, shrimp and egg rolls. The potstickers were extremely small, as well as the shrimps(they also tasted raw and not grilled as described). The \"soy\" sauce that came with it was just soy flavored water. I had to toss it. The bamboo sushi was also 1/2 the size of a normal sushi roll. Definitely not worth the $22.  Looks like we'll have to look for another good sushi place",

I've waited thirty minutes or more several times, but once you sit down and enjoy your first bite, you realize why they're so popular. It's easy to tell the chefs at NZ have a passion for what they do, the sushi is fresh, clean, flavorful, and has great texture. Just trust me and your fellow Yelpers, if you like sushi and you live in Charlotte, this is your place.   I recommended NZ to a couple friends who never tried sushi, and had them try the eel and shrimp tempura rolls, a mild, safe bet for a sushi first timer. Of course they loved it, but I was surprised when they devoured the mackerel nigiri. I'm so grateful that I live near NZ, but if I didn't, I'd go a few miles out of my way if I had that hard to satisfy sushi itch, and once you try NZ, you just may too!",

    "text": "Love love love love NZ Cafe. The best sushi I have had anywhere in Charlotte. I agree with those who say it towers above the rest. I've never had an experience where I felt any of my raw fish was less than perfectly fresh---- even on a Sunday, where the fish couldn't have been delivered that same day. My husband is a chef so we never get to go out Fri or Sat and I've learned that going out on a Sunday or a Monday is the True test of the quality of a restaurant.   As for the \"complaints\" on the wait times and size of the restaurant I have seen on here-- that's part of the deal when you go out to eat! When something is good people take notice and sometimes, yes you have to wait for a table!   I can't believe anyone reviewing NZ would write anything bad about the staff, as I have always felt them to be extremely friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and generally a well-oiled team. People who do not work in the food service industry conveniently are unaware of the fact that restaurant staff usually have many things on their mental to-do list at one time and many hungry people to make happy and run around trying to remember everything and keep their heads above water when they are  busy. That may have been a run on sentence but I wanted to make my point.  As for what I order our guilty pleasure is the Favorite Roll. Totally gringo but I don't care it's that delicious. Could go on and on about all the great rolls we've had there, as well as nigiri, and their cooked entrees as well. Looking forward to going back tonight.",

    "text": "New Zealand Cafe is a small sushi and Asian cuisine restaurant tucked away in a small strip-mall near Matthews. The sushi is always super fresh, the rolls are creative, prices are a steal and above all the food is delicious.  If i lived closer i would be here at least twice a week. Easily. It's that good. The space itself is pretty small so more times than not there is a wait to be seated. They do a decently paced turn-over on the tables though so its usually not too long and it is totally worth it.  To kill time I usually grab a menu and to read so when im in i am ready to order. Everything i have ever had at New Zealand Cafe has been great! Ginger salad, miso soup, apps. noodles, chicken entrees, seafood entrees, sushi... all soooo good! The sushi is outstanding. Some of the best in town.  If you order enough of it it they will put it on a boat for you. Know someone who doesn't appreciate a good sushi boat? Well, their entrees are awesome too. For around $6-10 the entrees include- the protein (ex: Mango Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken etc) , rice or noodles, a house salad and then 2 of the following: chicken skewers, fried shrimp, crab rangoon. That's 5 items for as little as $6 and no they don't skimp on the portion size either. There will most likely be left overs to take home. It's almost hard to believe how good of a deal these meals are. If your ever in the area, or hell-even if your not, I suggest a trip to New Zealand Cafe. It will not disappoint!",

The food lives up to its expectations and is well worth the wait(sometimes up to an hour/hour and a half at the dinner rush). Staff is always friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is amazing and if you sit at a low top table most of the time someone next to you will start up a conversation. Some of our favorite rolls are: the valentine roll, the favorite roll, ichiban spicy roll, wasabi salmon roll, and spider roll. The potstickers and ahi tuna are great starters as well! Pictures of our various favorites(and other great rolls as well) will be attached!",

I took a friend here last night and was impressed by Cathryn's knowledge, empathy and customer service while she took care of us.  The decor and design could use a revamp.  They are usually quite cramped here just because of all the business they receive.  I will say their machine accepts Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Microsoft Wallet and other NFC compatible payment services BUT GOOD LUCK getting the manager that usually runs the register to let you attempt to use it.  I was successful but she was like next time bring your card.  I won't be bringing my card because I never carry it on me so if they won't accept my method of payment which literally every other merchant will accept or at least attempt to accept then I won't do business at your establishment.  This is no reflection on Cathryn's service as she was trying her best to get it to work and was a star for hospitality and customer service.  You get a very decent amount of food here.  I was full and had to take the rest home.  This place really makes great food and fresh sushi.       If I have cash I may stop back by otherwise if they don't want to let me pay how I want guess I can't eat there",

Don't judge a book by it's cover - the place is small and it's located in a strip mall, but it's one of the best sushi places in Charlotte. Depending on where you are located, it's a bit of a drive, but again, worth it. The inside is small but it's clean and cute. The staff are knowledgable and skilled; our waitress took our order for 4 people and didn't write anything down. Impressive!  The menu is diverse and they have bento boxes and other authentic dishes besides sushi. The variety of rolls is awesome and they are always FRESH. The prices are very reasonable too - 6 sushi rolls and a bento box costs us $58. This place is definitely a hidden gem!",

It is in a nondescript shopping center off of Independence Blvd. it has kind of tiki bar interior and seats about 40 or so in close quarters. They have multiple menus, but we stuck with the sushi one since we had heard it was one of the best in the city. The sushi was terrific. Very fresh and a great variety. I had the Special California roll which swaps crab stick for the real thing and it was delicious. The albacore nigiri was fresh and soft. My husband's tempura tuna roll was yummy and not greasy. Waitstaff is really nice and attentive. Service was a little on the slow side for our entrees, but they were a full house and since we didn't order any appetizers, the wait was longer. And we're still getting used to the South's slower pace. It gets crowded, a wait for a table for 2 was about 10 minutes--half the time they said it would be. They also have outside seating, if you don't mind the heat or a scenic view of a parking lot and a Hungry Howie's. Prices are great for what you get. We will be returning over and over. Yey, NZC!",

The place is small and it's become very popular over the past several years. The sushi chefs behind the counter are rolling like crazy, but there's only so much room. If you're dining as a twosome, you'll be seated in the center section and you'll be within elbow's reach of the diners next to you. If you're lucky, you'll overhear an awkward first date.   The wait and the cramped quarters are generally worth it -- the sushi is great and it's very inexpensive compared to other places in Charlotte.   The only thing that keeps me from giving five stars to New Zealand is the accuracy. More than once, I've ordered scallop nigiri (\"hotate gai\") but I've received surf clam nigiri (\"hokki gai\"). Not a complete dealbreaker, but it's an unfortunate repeat issue.   Overall, this place is great and affordable. Worth a visit for sure, especially before or after going to the movies across the street.",

We ordered crab salad to start and 4 rolls to split. It took over 30 min for the crab salad to come out and nearly 1.5 hours for the rolls. Being that the place is so small we could easily see the issue, they were filling every single takeout order prior to the dine in orders. We could clearly see the sushi chefs working on nothing but takeout orders. Orders should be filled based on when they hit the system and it blows my mind that they would neglect the customers that chose to dine in. After leaving I scanned the reviews and noticed that this seems to be a common issue here. It's truly unfortunate that they have such a poor system in place because the sushi was actually good and if not for this major issue I would absolutely return.",

The tuna tasted like it was from a can.  The other roll was a safe order meaning that it is a roll you could get anywhere and it would meet expectations. I think, with anything, you must try a place for yourself to make your own judgement. Service was friendly but the food was nothing to get excited over.

Yes, it is in a strip mall, and no, the ambiance doesn't draw you in, but the fresh sushi and range of rolls sure does. The pricing is more than fair although I can't say that I've tried the $1 rolls. Seems a little risky to me unless you are vying for a sick day from work. I'm a sucker for a good caterpillar roll always as well as anything involving unagi, and there are plenty of eel options. My mister tried some tuna sashimi when we were there last, and it was outrageously good.",

We went on a Sunday night and it was packed!! It's tiny and we had to wait for a table. I will say as much as we enjoyed the sushi, the dining experience was a little uncomfortable because the tables were so close we were basically sitting with two other couples and the servers could barely get around.   The rolls are so cheap! I think the most expensive one was $11. We got four and enjoyed them all besides the hot tuna, just not our style. Favorite was the big boss roll! Everything tasted fresh and of good quality.   Will definitely be back the next time we want sushi. You get twice as much for the money here than other places I have been in Charlotte and it tastes just as good, if not better!",

    "text": "I decided to come here thanks to all of the raves on Yelp and I kind of regret that now.   My friend and I showed up around 5:00 on a Friday and we were able to walk right in and grab the last of two tables. As everyone has already mentioned, it's very small inside. There are six high top tables and then about four to five standard tables in the middle.  We were originally at one of the lower tables but a party of four consisting of small children came in and we were kindly asked to move to a high-top table. We weren't disappointed with that at all. The high top tables afford you some conversational privacy.  I ordered a glass of the plum wine (which was delicious) and then placed my order for a rose roll and vegetable tempura roll. The menu is not only sushi-focused, there are also bento box combos, fried rice, teriyaki chicken and steak, etc.  Our food arrived and it was decent although my rolls were wider than expected. What I will say about the sushi is that this is a good place to bring sushi newbies. They provide a lot of tempura options as well as rolls with mayo/cream cheese. The rose roll I ordered consisted of spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber and cheese sauce on the side. I didn't have any of the cheese sauce. The vegetable tempura consisted of fried broccoli, sweet potato, and zucchini.  The waitresses were great, friendly, and super willing to accommodate any needs. After we were done with our food, my friend and I both agreed that we've had better sushi.  Unfortunately, hours later (in the wee hours of the morning), I was struck with sharp stomach pains that led to me having to spend some time near a toilet bowl. I didn't have anything else to eat that night after leaving New Zealand Cafe so I'm utterly confused as to why my body reacted the way it but, needless to say, I won't be going back to find out.",

Based on the Yelp reviews, the typical lines and the fact I really wanted a good sushi place within a mile from where I live. So much so that I even went twice.  I should note I have only had the sushi, and I try to stick with sashimi and rolls without fried anything and I stay away from the entire fried rolls. Maybe their other stuff is better. I did like their bamboo roll, which is basically just fish wrapped in cucumber in a little ponzu sauce. Their eel isn't bad.  Everything else? Completely average at best. The rolls are way too large and have way too much rice. I popped the avocado off of a roll only to see a pencil-sized bit of filling in the middle of a giant wad of rice.  The fish seemed to be a bit fresher than average but I struggled to eat it or taste it around way too much rice. Some of the rolls are just bad. I couldn't manage to eat a grilled tuna roll.  I'd give the food about three stars (average), but the super-cramped space and the lines (why are there lines?) drop it down to about two stars. I'm regrettably driving farther for sushi now.",

I'm not sure which items were more New Zealand-esce because I mainly saw typically Japanese dishes/sushi options.   After getting past the restaurant name and confusion, I was able to concentrate on their extensive menu. As their sign outside indicates, they offer some sashimi between $1-$1.75. In addition, they have a lot of rolls to choose from. I got the spicy tuna and veggie tempura rolls ($4.95 and $4.55). Very good! The pricing was great!  Like others have indicated, the space is small with seating for maybe 12 in the middle, 6 high/stool tables on the sides, and a sushi bar to fit 3 at the front. The service is okay, but lacked on refilling drinks. When you go, be assertive or you may go without.   This location is in the Harris Teeter strip mall area. It's tucked away next to a nail salon. I wish it was closer to where I lived because I'm sure I would go here more often (I get sushi cravings regularly). If you love sushi, try this place...all of the previous reviews are right on!",

Chilly outside temps meant our table by the door was rather unfortunate with so many people coming & going & holding the door open for extended lengths of time. Brrrr!  Now, I should point out that this place is known for their sushi. I don't each fish - raw or otherwise, so I can't speak to what they're known for; other than to say my friends all raved about the Tiger Roll & Christmas Roll. I did, however, order the Daily Vegetable Special and the Vegetable Tempura rolls. This was my first time trying anything remotely sushi-related and my first time eating with chopsticks (they don't readily provide forks!! Well, they might if you NEED one and ask for it.) Our food was served in a very elaborate wooded boat, which was fun. The servers were very quick with our drink orders & refills.  I thought the food was flavorful & fresh. I'd skip the fried bananas & bananas sushi for dessert, but others seemed to enjoy the green tea ice cream for something unusual.  Next time, I'll probably try one of their pork or chicken meals for what seemed like a larger portion at a reasonable price.",

After waiting over an hour for my food I just picked a few pieces, paid and left. My waitress clearly didn't understand what I wanted.   I also ordered the poke which was good. However it was served in a martini glass so all the soy and delicious juice was pooled at the bottom of the glass and the top portion was bland. The glass is a cute serving idea but not good for the person wanting to enjoy flavor with their food.  I watched the staff fumble around and deliver the wrong food to many tables.

We decided to give it a try one Wednesday evening and understood why.    They have a pretty extensive Asian menu, including a wide variety of sushi.  We tried a tuna crunch roll to start and I literally could have eaten about 5 or 6 of those for my dinner and been completely satisfied (not to mention very full).  The roll was so full of flavor and only very lightly fried.   Nevertheless, I also ordered one of their hot chicken entrees, the spicy Thai curry chicken, too.  It came in a bento box with the chicken entree, rice, a few fried shrimp, dipping sauces, a salad with ginger dressing, and a crab cheese wonton.  All for under $6.  At dinner.  Wow.  It was VERY delicious and well worth the price.    What a find the New Zealand Cafe was!  We'll definitely be back for a very reasonably priced, hot, delicious meal.

The inside is interesting and super small. When we stopped by here we counted roughly 40 possible seats in the place - and that would be a tight fit! Regardless, we were able to grab a four-top and sit comfortably while we perused their menu(s).   And what a menu it was! We were each given four different menus: one solely for sushi, one dinner menu, a specials menu and one other blue menu that I didn't even get a chance to look at. I was a bit overwhelmed! The service was attentive and friendly and our waitress was please to offer up a few suggestions from their specialty roll menu. Here is what we went with:  Steamed Potstickers (Pork): Six tasty postickers served with a nice, light soy sauce. These potstickers were nicely flavored, especially with the sauce.   *I'm not a roe fan, so we chose to abstain from all fish roe from every roll.   Dynamite Roll: Spicy yellowtail, crab and avocado. While I wasn't super impressed for this roll (a bit mushy and lacking flavor), it was $4.95. That's a steal in anyone's book.  Tuna Crunchy Roll: I really wanted to love this roll, but it was just way too fried for my taste. The outside was super crunchy, stiff and too heavy. Plus, the roll came out piping hot and I'm not a fan of hot tuna rolls.   Pink Roll: Tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, cod wrapped in soy paper. This was a pretty good roll but HUGE! So large that I had to gnaw off half at a time. I'm sure that looked super hot.   Ichiban Roll: Spicy albacore tuna, crab, avocado, topped with spicy tuna and wasabi mayo with a dash of Sriracha on top. I liked the flavor of this roll quite a bit, as it's definitely got a kick. I wish it had a little more texture, though. Maybe some crunchies on top would help?   While I definitely see the appeal of New Zealand Cafe, the cheap rolls, generous portions and creative combinations, it didn't blow me away like I thought it would. Considering it's a bit of a hike from my house, I'm not sure I'll be coming back often, but I definitely want to give this little gem another try in the near future.",

We drive 45 minutes across town to eat here.  Prices are fair, service is good, the sushi is excellent.  Presentation is great, the rice is perfect, and the portions are abot 20-30% more than anywhere in town.  Try the Ichiban roll!  Went on monday night at 7:00 and place was full, but only waited 5 minutes for table.  The dining room is small and a bit tight, but the food makes up for lack of elbow room.",

Had some questions and was rushed through those.  Hmmm....not yet impressed.  No lunch specials really for sushi.  There are Bento boxes but they are about $13 for ones that include sushi.  So I ordered two rolls including a basic spicy tuna.    One person making sushi....it took a while.  Got my order and the spicy sauce on the tuna was a mayo based sauce.  In 20 years of eating sushi I have never had a mayo sauce on spicy tuna.  Also it wasn't very spicy.  Also was rather warm for sushi.  Rice was good.    I think this place may be a good intro to sushi but not for the seasoned fans.  Hmmm...I was hoping for better.",

He was the only one not sick. honestly I just don't think that they handle their food sanitarily probably cross-contamination with fish chicken not cooking things properly or just plain dirty or not keeping things at a proper temperature. If you have a sensitive stomach I suggest you don't eat there and find a cleaner nicer not so cramped seafood place",
