The waiter and waitress we so attentive and were genuinely vested in our enjoyment of the experience.  Very kind and wonderful people.    The dining area was pretty busy including couples, locals, Ethiopians and even families (we were impressed seeing the younger kids be so adventurous and genuinely loving it).  This is a must try!!",

They shared the vegetarian feast full of various vegetable and lentil items on a bed of injeera with extra on the side.  I did the doro wat with some fresh Ethiopian cheese on the side, which was just fantastic. If you know what paneer is, it's basically a crumbled version.  I had to drop one star as they ran out of Ethiopian coffee but we would go back to re-try any time.  The service was great and they really wanted to make sure we enjoyed everything. You can tell they really care about what the put out in front of their customers. That's why it was packed even at 8:30 at night. The Mother was very impressed",

While you will not find any trendy seating or decor, what I can confirm is that you will find some of the best and freshest ingredients and food I've eaten in a while.  The service, like others have mentioned, was super pleasant and very eager to explain and answer questions we might have had.  Don't come here expecting some sexy, romantic or upscale atmosphere.  Come here to eat clean, fresh and incredible cultural cuisine.  You won't be disappointed.",

Only difference is the spongy flat bread, call injera. It has a slight sour taste to it. Tibs are meat dishes sauteed with vegetables. Their beef Tibs are very flavorful, it's a combination of spice with a touch of lemon and cinnamon taste. The zilzil wat, is a stew. It was okay. Too much fat for my taste. Ethiopian coffee takes time to make. Be aware it is very strong coffee, but smooth. They have a cappuccino machine if you want the typical coffee.  The owners are very nice and helpful. Definitely will come back.",

I'm from San Francisco and I've had great Ethiopian food there and in New York and DC, but I would not have expected to find equally amazing food out here in Charlotte. So pleasantly surprised! The vegetarian feast was fantastic and filling for 2 people, not to mention super cheap (we paid $22 for 2 people to split the vegetarian feast and one additional side dish). Love this place - will return again, and hope you do too!",

If there are vegetarians or those gluten free'ers in your crew, they won't be disappointed with this place. There are options for everyone.  The staff was awesome and very helpful to us first timers. I think they got a good laugh watching me try to eat with my hands. I think I wore as much as I ate. Both service and food were excellent. Looking forward to trying the dinner menu.",

Interior is spotlessly clean and the only thing Abugida is lacking at present is desserts and a liquor license. They're working on the liquor license so soon you'll be able to enjoy a cool glass of honey wine with your food.  Don't miss out on their sampler platter which is a good value and the best way to sample a variety of dishes. They serve a delicious collard greens + house made Ethiopian fresh cheese dish which is very unique; we have never encountered this dish before and we eat Ethiopian food frequently.   All in all Abugida is a great place for people who are addicted to Ethiopian food or people who are trying it for the first time...and everyone in between.

The \"beef tips\" are good and you should definitely try them at some point but the Kitfo is better in my opinion.  It's minced beef with butter and spices and it's delicious.    Plenty of food for 4 people to share at a great price.  For beer drinkers they have a solid Ethiopian Lager that goes well with the spices.",

I was away for a few months and missed the njeri, beef, cabbage and carrots and everything.  Most of all, when you go to Abugida's Ethiopian Restaurant,  it's like family. Everyone welcomes you with steaming boul of food. Of course, don't forget to order a META Beer ( one of the choice beers of Ethiopia.) Thank you Yodit and Family for a great oasis of food in Charlotte, NC.",

The staff was super friendly and checked on us just the right amount of times. The location does not look like much on the outside but it is homey, neat and clean on the inside. The food. Where do I start? So, the only recommendation I have is to cook the cabbage and potatoes a little longer but that is truly a preference on my part. I like them both pretty soft. All of the flavors blended wonderfully and the lamb (see pic) was super yummy. I fell in Love with their Doro Alecha- the chicken was so tender and all of the flavors blended wonderfully! I more than recommend this spot if your are in the Charlotte area and looking for some genuinely delicious Ethiopian food.",

    "text": "Wow!   This dining experience transported me to a different land.  I left Charlotte and went straight to Ethiopia!  After reading the glowing YELP Reviews, this place became a priority for me.  So much to review.  First the menu and food - extremely different than American fare, based on presentation and FLAVORS.  I had the vegetable plate which was a sampling of many kinds of vegetables.  It was served with a basket of rolled up spongy bread.  Because there are no utensils, the bread is unrolled and used to scoop up the food.  This takes practice and getting used to.  The experience was fascinating, but probably not good for someone trying to avoid bread. I feel confident that utensils would have been available upon request, however my recommendation is to experience Ethiopian food the way that the natives eat it!   The iced tea had strong hints of Cinnamon and ginger and was simply delicious.  The entire meal woke up every taste bud in my mouth.  Atmosphere - very warm colors and artwork that added to the feeling of being in Ethiopia.  There was only one other table of people dining for lunch today and when they left, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.  It was a pleasant and comfortable space.   Service - impeccable.  The waiter was as hospitable as it gets.  Explained all the menu options and helped us understand the technique for eating the food. His native accent also added to the feeling of being outside of Charlotte.  So, in summation, I loved the experience and so glad that Charlotte has another dining option that is not a boring chain restaurant.  For those reading this review, GO CHECK OUT THIS PLACE!  Three thumbs up!",

But, let's face it - it's not the cleanest place - and that does matter.   And clearly, there is an issue with safe food handling. It's not reasonable that any of the dishes would be \"cooked to order\", due to the complexity of the preparations. So, the food is made in advance, and then stored in a fridge or freezer.   The owners need to pay VERY CLOSE ATTENTION to how long the food is kept warm, if it sits at low or room temperature, how cold it's kept when stored, and how long it is stored. I have been very sick, and it's just not worth it to me to go back again.   Owners: most people won't tell you - but, they will tell others, and they'll stop going. Good luck getting this sorted out!",

We knew we were going to have a great experience the second we walked in because (1) the smell of the food was intoxicating and (2) nearly all of the patrons were Ethiopian (always a great sign of an authentic place).   My husband and I were both very hungry and tend to be big eaters, so we figured we'd start with the house platter with steak. Oh my gosh, so good and so filling! We thought we'd be ordering more food for a second course, but we were stuffed to the gills after splitting this one $18 platter. What a deal!  The service was friendly and the ambiance is very casual, like most places in the area. We will definitely be back. Next time we'd love to try some Ethiopian wine or beer too, and we'll definitely be bringing friends!",

Prior to coming here, I had done my research and read the reviews. I knew what to expect in terms of ambiance, lack of utensils, etc. While walking in, there were two things I noticed. 1. The restaurant felt like a home. Like settling in to dinner at Grandma's kind of feel. 2. The aroma while walking in hit you so hard that you knew you were in for a good meal!   I did notice that they have added beer and wine to the menu, which is a nice touch. It also looked like there was Ethiopian beer on the menu. We settled on the Abugida feast with chicken.  The feast came out after about 25-30 minutes (I noticed this wait time was consistent but the place is small so it makes sense) and I immediately figured out this was too much food for my husband and I....we definitely gave it our best effort though and almost finished! Everything was soooooo delicious. Yes, it was messy but it was so good. Candidly, I have no idea what I was eating but it was all fantastic and we just went for it.   Additionally, my husband got the Ethiopian coffee which was super tasty. They brew the coffee in a big ceramic pitcher when you order it.  Overall, delish food. I left crazy full.

I got a side of the collard greens (gomera? Sorry I forgot the Ethiopian name! ) that were excellent.   All the vegetarian options were delicious lentils, potatoes, cabbage and more.   The food was delicious and had a lot of flavor, but I wouldn't call it \"spicy\".   The African beer was delicious and the Ethiopian coffee was OUTSTANDING. I mean wow.

The people who work here we so friendly. They seemed just as excited as my sister, explaining the dishes and cooking styles; they seemed to really take pride in what they were doing.   And they SHOULD take pride, because did I mention that the food is delicious!? The vegetarian feast is my favorite. I've also tried the zelzel wat (I think that's what it's called -- it's the beef) and homemade cottage cheese. All of it very yummy.   The vibe is very cozy, almost like going to a friend's for lunch. I can imagine parking being a hassle if they had a rush of customers but I've never had a problem. That said, delivery from here is just as tasty as dine-in so don't let a little laziness get in the way of enjoying a good meal -- go ahead and have someone deliver it to you ;)  I hope this place does well. Seems like some really great people running it and I so love Ethiopian food! Definitely check it out, whether you are a long time fan of Ethiopian or a first timer, you will be glad you did!",

This is my first time eating Ethiopian food, so please bear with me.  I ordered the vegetarian feast, which came with 6 different diches. The all tasted good, but they were a little too \"mushy\". The red lentils were my favorite. Honestly, the food tasted really good. It was spicy, but good spicy. The dishes all come with a side of what looks like a very thin sour pancake, I have mixed feelings about the taste and texture of this \"bread\".  They did not bring any silverware with my food, so I tried going \"local\" and eating with my hands. All you do is cut a piece of the bread and use it to grab the other food, but after two bites, I decided to order a fork (they have plastic forks in the back).  Now, the place. It looks kind of sketchy from the outside, but the inside is very clean. It is just and old house that was transformed into a restaurant. I think they still have some rooms there...",

The only issue is you may need more meat or protein but likely the ideal route for your first time. The traditional bread is delicious and the spices are just delightful. The iced tea was good too.   Other notes: the family who runs this place is super nice. Our bill was very inexpensive ($30) and they worried they overcharged us.   We will be back!",

The experience is so consistent, every time I have gone the food has been fabulous and the service is wonderful. The employees are so friendly and helpful - if this is your first time visiting, mention that and they will help you through the menu.  The Abugida Feast is the way to go for a group of 2 or more. We typically add 1 additional protein to have some options - I highly recommend adding lamb, you can adjust the spice level on this as well. This gives you the opportunity to try many items and trust me, you'll be full.  The injera is so tasty, and it's just a fun, almost therapeutic experience to eat with your hands with a group of friends or family.   I also recommend the coffee service!",

Ethiopia, the Great Horn of Africa with 3 million years of history, surely has perfected cooking with all the spices married together in perfect harmony.  And, so it was with my dinner.  Yelp's International Supper event was held here in April 2019.  A bunch of us gathered for an evening buffet set up for us (vs. ala carte), and I think we wiped them out.  I wanted to grab a chafing dish and lick it clean, but Nikki frowned at my suggestion.  Girls!  The highlight for me, beyond the delectable aroma swirling around my head and the soulful company of friends, was the Beef Tibs and, surprisingly, the rice (it was spiced with whole cloves and cooked perfectly).  Mmmmm.  The menu states the beef is \"sauteed in onions, tomato, jalapeno, a touch of rosemary and Ethiopian spice butter.\"  Well, that's intentionally vague.  Whatever that \"spice butter\" is I want it, and badly!  My guess is it's a riff on berbere, a spice blend which includes cardamom, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and all-spice, etc.  Well, it's damn good, a winner in my book.  So, looking to expand your culinary horizon to an ancient culture with its food, hospitality, and character front and center?  Way up on my \"Give 'em a whirl\" meter.  Tear off a piece of injera bread and swab up your food.  Go here!",

Some things had a very flavorful heat to them which I loved. As others have said, you don't get utensils, but they will bring them if you ask. I didn't miss them myself.   Everyone there was incredibly friendly and accommodating. It's a pretty small restaurant so we took up most of the seating. There is a small parking lot out back.

This allowed us to sample a bit of everything they have to offer. From the pictures and description, the buffet consisted of items from the Abugida feast.

Was greeted by our server, Henok, who was amazing. Very patient and knowledgeable! He gave us suggestions for food and everything he recommended was soooo good. We ordered the Abudiga feast, beef tibs, and spicy shiro - OMG! The tibs and shiro were so flavorful, I can still taste the spices on my tongue.   One thing that was culturally different was that you ate all of the food with the injera and your hands. No silverware or plates were provided - it was family style, which I also found to be amazing because it allowed us to really engage.   I am so happy with the experience and can't wait to come back and bring others!",

    "text": "First experience enjoying Authentic Ethiopian food!   And I must say what a great place to experience it from. The atmosphere made you feel at home and the buffet style lunch was a bonus and perfect for a first timer! The buffet gives you options to try a lot of different things so you are more in tune with what you really like for your next visit!  Not to mention my favorite thing was using my hand instead of utensils! No judgment zone! Messy finger licking good. The food was very tasty and had just the right amount of spices, I particularly loved the beef, lentils and the cabbage and carrot mix. Already planning my next visit with another few first timers!!! Yummy",

Many people there seemed to really know their stuff and be veterans of Abugida.  It's a funny venue and I think it used to be a house. There is not a lot of seating - they ran out around 7pm on the Saturday that we were there. Service is somewhat slow, so I'd expect waiting would take a while.  We each got our own platter which would maybe be too much for some people but worked for us. I love how vegetarian or vegan-friendly the menu is - there isn't variety in teh sense that there's one veg platter but it does, of course, come with many different dishes on it, so it works.",

The decor is simple but cool, beautiful African portraits hang on the dark peach colored walls. The small dining area is very clean, very very clean which I appreciate.   I really enjoyed the vegetarian platter and don't let the fact that it's a plate of vegetables fool you, you WILL get full. This Ethiopian cuisine reminds me of soul food, just seasoned the way Ethiopians prefer if that makes sense. So it's potatoes, collared greens , lentils, etc . You can eat with your hands or ask for a fork. If you choose hands, you use the Injera to scoop your food. I chose fork this time because I had a manicure with sheer lacquer and the food will temporarily stain your nails if you use your fingers.   When you've tried an entree , try the warm herbal tea they have as well. Amazing spice!",

    "text": "The food had some really great flavors and the service was phenomenal. The staff was super sweet and accommodating.  Here's what I ordered:  Ethiopian Hot Tea-super delicious. You can tell that the tea consisted of real ingredients such as cinnamon sticks and cloves.   Abugida Feast w/ Doro Wet(chicken)-the flavors were really great. My gripe was with the potatoes and chickpeas which were undercooked. That was a texture that I didn't enjoy, however, the seasoning was on point. The Doro Wet sauce had a little kick of spice that was nice and a ric thick consistency. The chicken itself didn't have much chicken flavor nor much flavor from the sauce. It was as though it was boiled (without seasoning) and then added to the sauce right before serving.  Kitfo-It didn't click in my mind that this was mid- rare MINCED meat and not steak cubes. I was expecting something completely different, but had to check myself once I re-read the item description. It tasted like mid-rare..minced...meat..like the menu says lol. I wasn't ready. There were no strong flavors. In fact I brought it home with the intention of cooking it until it's well done and seasoning it to my liking. I wasn't too fond of this item, but it may be good if cooked until well done.  Rice- I ordered my dishes with rice because I am not a fan of the injera bread, which is the traditional accompaniment. The rice was slamming. It was extra long grain white rice with some nice aromatic action going on. I got some to go.  Ethiopian Coffee-I'm not a coffee person, but wanted to have the experience. The coffee had notes of cocoa and had a bit of a bitter after taste which was, surprisingly, quite nice.  I'll be back again to try some more dishes.",

After hearing from multiple friends that we had to go and check this place out, my wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Now I will say this place is tiny. it essentially feels like a converted house and has maybe 8 tables. However, I think that adds to the charm of what turned out to be a very fun meal and experience.  This is an Ethiopian restaraunt. For many around this area (including me) this is something that most people have never tried before. I went in with an open mind and wanted to have a unique experience. Starting with the staff, I was blown away by how friendly everyone was!  It felt like this was more than just a business to them, but also a way to share a slice of their homeland. We settled on the Abugita Feast with chicken and the smell of when it hit the table was awesome. No utensils here, so be ready to use your hands with their bread to transport the food to your mouth. It was honestly fun to interact with our meal this way and the serving size was more food than two people should try to eat - so be sure to bring friends!  Overall they are serving up some awesome food and it is a fun way to have a unique experience and learn a little bit more about what is outside our country.",

There was a large platter of injera in rolls (not like a bun, rolled up), a dish of beef, a dish of chicken and half a dozen vegetable choices that were absolutely delicious.    I had 3 pieces of injera and left NOTHING on my plate.  That's a nice thing about eating with injera, you can swab every last scrap up and not miss a morsel.  The building is small and unobtrusive.  I missed it when I drove by the first time.  I think I wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't been depending on my GPS.  It is SO much worth finding.",

It's almost like we didn't go to the same restaurant. The food was OK, but nothing to write home about. (BUT, this is our first try at Ethiopian, so maybe to us Ethiopian food in general is just OK). That was the good part. Now for the bad: they offer NO ALCOHOL at this restaurant. What's worse, they charge a $5 corkage fee for bringing your own bottle! This was a Saturday night out! Mama needs her wine. There are also no appetizer or dessert options. Which leads me to my next con: the service was horrible. They were nice, but sooooo slooooow. With nothing to munch on, we were starved by the time they brought out our food (about 30 minutes after ordering). In the end, it was an interesting exotic experience, but we won't be back.",

Everything was spot on, we've had Ethiopian food before and this was easily some of the best.   All the veggies were fresh and the quality was outstanding.  Our server was great, we really wanted to try the Shiro Wat so she suggested we just order 1 vegetarian feast, the Kitfo, and Shiro Wat instead of two vegetarion feasts.  That was a good idea, we already couldn't finish all the food and ordering two feasts would have been entirely too much!    Don't hesitate, go here, and if you've never had Ethiopian food, this place would be an excellent introduction.  Looking forward to are next visit!",

Besides the food, the staff was so friendly and charming. They spent time at our table talking to us and explaining the menu. We will be back again and again!",

Eating from a shared plate is a really powerful way to enjoy a meal with people. It's the kind of connection too frequently missing from our fast paced world. I look forward to going back and becoming more familiar with the menu items, everything was delicious and in new ways.",

We will be back. Please bring your friends and share the word--we want this new restaurant to thrive!!",

The restaurant is light, open, warm, and inviting! The service is friendly and attentive! You cannot eat here and not feel welcomed and happy. The injera is the freshest I've ever had. The kitfo is my favorite and was seasoned perfectly with just the right level of spiciness. The portions are very generous for the price and you will not leave hungry. If you've never had Ethiopian, step out of your comfort zone and head to Abugida Cafe.",

I've had Ethiopian in a few different states (and DC) here, and in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and their injera rivals them all! My husband and I split the vegetarian feast and beef tibs and ate until we couldn't anymore. Very authentic and the owner/chef was so nice! We spoke with her and they still get all of their spices from back home. Highly recommend.",

The chicken that comes with the non-veg platter is delicious, so is the beef (you can choose one).  The beef has a bit of heat, the chicken dish is child-friendly.   Get the Shiro- a creamy red lentil stew.  It is luxurious.  The non-veg feast plus the shiro is enough for 3-4 people. Good Ethiopian food takes a little time.  Don't wait until you're starving to get there, it will take 15-20 minutes for your food to come out.",

Abugida is a family operation through and through and like all the best Ethiopian restaurants, has the feeling of being a guest at the family table. From the warm, friendly service to the familiar foods prepared with the personal touch of the chef, it might not be fancy but every bite is comfort and delight! The menu is broad, offering choices for omnivores, vegetarians and vegans alike, and options to please people new to the cuisine as well as those experienced with it. The spouse and I each ordered a vegetarian sampler as well as some shiro wat, which proved to be a smart move because the shiro wat at Abugida is some of the most enjoyable I've tried. All the food was delicious, making the long drive back to Raleigh seem even longer since we'd locked the leftovers in the trunk in order to have some cold for breakfast - definitely an underrated part of the Ethiopian food experience! If you want food that will please the spirit and the palate alike, treat yourself to a seat at the table of Abugida.",
