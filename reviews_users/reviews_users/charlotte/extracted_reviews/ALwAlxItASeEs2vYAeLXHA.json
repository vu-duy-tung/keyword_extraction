    "text": "So, turns out I'm old. We went out for a night on the town for The Husband's birthday. We had some yummy drinks and hit a hardcore thumping nightspot. Then we decided to leave because it was too loud, getting late and we had to head home. As we walked back to the car and passed Futo Buta, one of our friends says, \"Ooh! The Brussels sprouts!\"  The Brussels sprouts are fried with an absolutely delicious mixture of soy sauce, sea salt, sesame and bonito. They're truly perfection! There's a nice smoky flavor on the back and the sweetness stays for just the perfect length of time. It doesn't linger, but it's not so quick that you miss it. The Tori Kara Age (Japanese fried chicken) is also a great choice. They break out the sea salt again, but with these you get some ginger, lime and mint as well. If you like mayo, there's a chili version of it for a dip.   On the first visit, I got the Tonkotsu bowl with ground pork and it was amazing. I don't typically like what my Jersey friend calls \"dippy eggs,\" but that's the way they come in the bowls.  I think it's good, though. It definitely adds a level of creamy yum that would be missed.   Quick recap? We're old. We left a bar and went to go get Brussels sprouts. But it was totally worth it. And I'd do it again. You can bet on it.",

    "text": "Really not happy after my most recent visit to Futo Buta. I usually LOVE this place, and order from there at least once a week. Recently, however, I've been disappointed with both the quality and the value. Today I ordered my usual: rice crispy squares and Tonkatsu with extra pork belly. The extra pork belly is $5 extra. Well, today I got ramen that had no onsen egg, and ONE EXTRA PIECE OF PORK. ONE. FOR FIVE DOLLARS. Wtf?!?! If I'm spending $19 total on a bowl of ramen, I expect that 1.) all the freaking ingredients are going to be there and 2.) I get the extras that I pay for. The tonkatsu usually comes with 3 pieces of pork, and for five bucks I literally got 1 extra piece. Not to mention, the noodles were soggy and literally disintegrating off my chopsticks, the rice crispy squares were just falling apart, and I got half the amount of tuna for the squares. There was enough tuna for 3  squares of rice. That's it.   Extremely disappointed.",

The outdoor dining area is very neat, right next to the Lynx line with a great view of downtown. I would give five stars except they play the crappiest music at loud volume inside to the point that I will not eat there if outside seating is not available. The music is mid '70's obscuro rock that sounds like it was picked out by a 60 year old guy who still has a reel to reel and Bose 901 speakers. Perhaps some more modern music that is a little more laid back would be more suitable for a chill place like this.",

Top it off with chili oil and make it complete.  I love the Tori Kara Age (chicken with chili mayo and lime), the brussel sprouts, rice crispy squares with tuna. I've never had a bad meal here. Always piping hot, fresh and plentiful.  It is usually over crowded inside due to its small size but I think that is part of the charm. You may have to climb onto your barstool or sit two inches from a stranger.  Talk or don't talk, no one seems to be offended.  I like this atmosphere. Seems like all the attention is on the food. Most are just happy to get a table.  Come winter when a good bowl of soup is what you need, you'll welcome it at any proximity to strangers.  Perhaps you'll leave with a new friend but should always leave full and satisfied.",

The noodles are in themselves delicious, and the broth is not regular broth that you think of, but an extremely flavorful, perfectly spiced addition to the noodles, meat, and vegetables it contains. The restaurant is normally pretty busy, so I would recommend getting there a little earlier than you're ready to eat. They generally sit people pretty quickly though! I recommend trying the Fire and Ice for your first time, and definitely splurging on the green tea soft serve ice cream as an extra treat after dinner!",

And the fried chicken are like nuggets that were not at all special; sauce left a lot to be desired. The sushi was overpriced, like everything else, and had way too much going on. Couldn't taste the fish as they had so many other seasonings and flavors overpowering the fish - but then again that may not have been so bad, given the other flavors w the broth and fried chicken.  I wasn't expecting NYC-esque  noodle house, but close since it stated they make their noodles in-house.  Service was also slow. And it wasn't even crowded. We went on a late Sunday afternoon.  Overpriced and salty is what I chalk this up to.",

Reading the reviews and it's clear that people are starting to figure it out. Until they upgrade their broth, my go to for ramen in Charlotte is Yume nearby. Yume hits a home run with their ramen broth which is creamy, rich, and delicious. Yume's sushi is the best in town too.",

The buns were great and so was the ramen, the broth was perfect, not too salty or anything of that sort.   I was also a bit worried since i am famously terrible at using chopsticks but if you ask they will give you a cheater pair  (basically w paper shoved between the two sticks with a rubber band) and you will feel like pro without having to be the only person eating with a fork in the entire restaurant.

    "text": "Ready for an adventure?!   My sister chose this place for her birthday and boy this place is hard to find. Go into a sketchy parking deck, walk a tiny sidewalk and then boom there's Futo Buta next to the Lightrail.   FOOD: Gyoza and pork buns for apps were spectacular. The Tonkatsu and Shoyu ramen are amazing for spicy lovers (they even give you housemade chili oil, sriracha and chile powder for added spice) as is the vegan option (me and my mother's favorite). Their outdoor seating is the best, as I'm not a fan on communal dining.   SERVICE: Our waitress was sweet, conversational and quick. She was quick to refill our water glasses and take care of us. The wait was a bit excessive for our main courses but this place was slammed. With that in mind, the food was outstanding.  Great atmosphere and outstanding Japanese fusion food. This place is a hidden gem in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Futo Buta is amazing. I was skeptical when I heard \"ramen\" but every dish is delicious.   This might not be the best place to try to bring a group on the weekend. It is very small and intimate so you may end up waiting awhile. Our group of 5 was seated at a bar along the wall so the people on the ends couldn't talk. Also service was pretty slow the night we went.  The food makes up for these things. I had the steam bun appetizer and the Miso ramen. The quality of food is amazing. The pork belly in the ramen just melts in your mouth. It is filling but doesn't leave you feeling full and bloated.  Food is 5 stars but service was a 3 star. I think they could benefit from taking reservations but I haven't gone on a weeknight so it may be a lot chiller then.",

    "text": "So, if you've been following my reviews - you know that I use the word \"love\" a lot. But really - I love the Miso (happy) ramen bowl here. I crave it. And my wallet totally hates craving a $12 bowl of ramen. But it's delicious.  The first time I came in here was probably my favorite, it was middle of the afternoon, not lunch or dinner time. I sat at the bar, got to hang out a bit. The servers are very attentive and friendly. The music is loud. The other times that I've been here its been a little more busy, making the meal a little less relaxing than I like. The bar seating is extremely close, but maybe how its suppose to be? They have a community table in the middle, where you're told to sit across from whoever you're with - not beside them. This makes it a little tougher to have a meal when you're across the table and sitting next to strangers - but I'm friendly! So I made it work. They have fresh specials daily, a great little craft beer selection, and lots of items to choose from.  The food has been on point, every single time. I get the Miso (happy) bowl and totally fall in love. I could see this being a fun first date if you could go in the off hours. Sit at one of the little tables, try to look cool shoving ramen noodles into your mouth. I'll be back here, just not as much as I would like - because my wallet doesn't like expensive ramen nearly as much as my stomach does.",

Because of the one bad experience I had here where I was told it'd be a 20min wait and after 30 we were not seated I figured we'd be seated any minute....1 1/2 hours later finally seated. We told our server about our wait and he then said \"the wait will be worth it in my head were seated and ready to eat. He gets our drinks an appetizers brings them put then runs away and doesn't come back for 30 min. At this point my company is irritated about their wait we get someone to fetch our server after we finally get a hold of him and order we see him serving his new table and he says to them as a joke \"you should feel lucky we had some people waiting here for an hour and a half.\" Honestly besides this one experience that took 3 hours to get in and out of futo but I love the place. Otherwise I wouldn't go back the next day.",

For dessert we had the Pumpkin Spice soft serve which I will admit I was not crazy about, but it was still good. The service was great, wasn't too pricey and it was in a great location!

It took a while to get anyone's attention to ask about seating and then I was placed in the corner of the bar, looking at the wall. I ordered the duck buns and the miso ramen. The buns came first and then I waited a while for the ramen, and again to get the check. The food was good, but not great. I'd keep searching for ramen elsewhere.   Food details: The buns were good - they tasted homemade since the texture wasn't as fine and smooth as the premade kind. The duck on them was tender and flavorful. As for the ramen, the miso broth was a bit modern in take and heavy on the pork flavor rather than a mix of chicken and pork. The broth was okay but the noodles really reminded me of top ramen since they were a bit too soft and the broth was on the fattier side from the pork. I didn't like the broth or the noodles so much but the toppings were very good. The chashu pork was fatty but done well so that the fat just melted in my mouth; corn was crip and sweet; and the egg was a great soft-medium boil.",

    "text": "Today I was very excited to have my first \"Gourmet Ramen\" experience and found the hype of Futo Buta to be promising. We arrived and although it was busy, seating was available immediately either outside or inside. Since it was such a nice day we sat outside.  Tables, chairs and individual umbrellas were very clean, as was the patio itself. Depending on which side of your table you sit on you can have a gorgeous view of uptown as well as the light rail as it zips by the Bland St. station on a regular basis.  Appetizers first: Me and my girlfriend decided to try two different steamed buns. We tried the Duck Confit w/ Leek & Arugula, and also the Pork Belly with Slaw. These were by far the best part of our experience. The buns themselves were very springy and just the right amount of moisture. Meat was cooked perfectly on both offerings, delicious flavor combinations. I wouldn't have minded just getting double orders of these!  Ramen was great too! I got the Tonkotsu, which had a very mellow earthy/hearty broth and featured pork belly and big hearty mushrooms. My girlfriend got the Miso ramen which also featured pork belly, a sweeter broth (not too sweet) and fresh crisp veggies. I will tell you that both dishes were VERY filling. Expect to get a to-go container! The prices on the ramen were a bit of a sticker shock until you see exactly how much you're getting.  The only thing I wish were more up to par was the service. Our waitress just did not seem to be with it today. Didn't come off as rude, just inattentive, going through the motions. As I looked at the waiter serving the other customers he seemed really passionate about service. This was really the only thing missing that would have made our visit a top-notch lunch experience. We will definitely be back and will update after the next visit!",

    "text": "This is a great South End neighborhood restaurant.   Location/Atmosphere: My husband and I live walking distance to FB. So we really like the location. It's right on the rail trail and there is a light rail station that stops right there. I believe there is a parking garage near by that you can park in, but do not quote me on that as I have never actually driven to this location. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny on the inside there are 2 long tables that people can sit at and then bar seating along the window. It's very cool looking on the inside. It has a very industrial look with exposed ceiling and lots of wood and steel. There is an opening to the kitchen where you can see the magic happen! We have never actually eaten inside. On the outside they have a decent amount of walk way seating with umbrellas in the summer and heaters in the cooler months. We really like eating outside because you can have your own table as opposed to inside you are sharing the table with many people.   Food/Drink: The food is great! I've only had one dish that I wasn't crazy about (more on that later). We like to start our meal off with an order of the Rice Krispie Squares: spicy tuna, crispy fried rice, wasabi soy. If you have ever been to Nobu and had the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna... the Futo Buta one is even better! I know, crazy! It's plated beautifully too. We typically order the Shoyu: chicken and dashi broth, pecan smoked pork belly, bamboo, scallion, onsen egg*, wakame, roasted and julienne leek. I have chicken added to it. It's really tasty and the portion is huge. I can never finish it all which is unfortunate because in my humble opinion, Ramen doesn't make the  best left overs. Soggy noodles :( I wish they had a half portion option! The chicken they add to the Ramen is delicious. Always white meat and always cooked perfectly. We decided to get takeout one night and I accidently ordered the Chizu: chicken broth, pecorino cheese, whipped egg, shiso pesto, yuzu, black garlic, scallion. This was a mistake. The Chizu is the \"buttered noodle\" of the Ramen world. It was really sub-par. I've ordered wine here before, but I know that they have sake, beer and cocktails.   Service: The people that work here are always kind, prompt, and accommodating. It's part of the reason we keep coming back!  Price: Most Ramen dishes are priced between $12-$14, we typically add a protein which costs another $5. A $20 entree is what should be expected because even if you are only adding extra veggies/sauce, there is $1-$2 per veggie/extra sauce charge.  Notes: Get here early! The line can be crazy. During the winter months, definitely come early because outside seating won't be an option.   We always enjoy coming here, are always treated well and never leave hungry!",

    "text": "What a delightful yet hearty dinner! Perfect start to a weekend after a long Saturday shift. Excellent ambience both indoors and outdoors, overlooking the skyline. Tonkotsu, Buta Bowl, and Miso (pictured) all wonderfully comforting with homemade ramen and seemingly limitless layers of savory goodness highlighted by a scrumptious pork belly that is perfectly seasoned/grilled/presented.  Only recommendation regards the lengthy seating time (30min) despite several open tables outdoor, which we had requested; asked to keep standing in order to not \"overbook the kitchen\". We could have been offered seats at those tables prior to actually ordering. Nonetheless, some of the best ramen in Charlotte.",

    "text": "This not even close to Japanese Ramen. The first problem is the price. It's about double what it shouldl cost. Ramen is simple and cheap. Not some expensive endeavor. It's why so many families in Japan have ramen shops. It's simple and easy to get the ingredients. The broth is not deep and rich like it should be and to make up for the lack umami they just add a shit load of salt in hopes you don't know any better. Most people don't know any better.  Japanese ramen should comfort you and feel like a warm hug. The ramen at Futo Buta is bland umami wise and salty and way too much going on to make any sense of it. They have taken a bunch of very simple Japanese dishes and tried to make them something they are not supposed to be. Japanese cooking is simple and clean....nothing about this place is simple and clean at all. It's overworked and stressed.  When I asked the owner if he had been to Japan to have real ramen he almost gladly said he had never been. So you make ramen they taste nothing like ramen and have no idea what real ramen tastes like?   This place makes money for its location and the fact that no one makes good ramen in Charlotte including Futo Buta. However, there is one place at the Whole Foods in Waverly. Best ramen in town and I have taken people from Japan there and they all agree it tastes like home...home being Japan. Futo Buta is overpriced and a joke....nothing about it is Japanese. It's a mess. Too much going on and not enough focus on anything.",

The sauce with it worked well with it too.  I got the Tonkatsu bowl, since it is a popular dish. I wish I got a spicier level. I wanted to be conservative with the spice, but more spice would have added more flavor to the bowl. The meat was really great and good quality. I'm not a huge pork fan, but still enjoyed this pork.   The portions were so huge we didn't have room for desert:( Will be back for the soft serve!",

    "text": "4.5 Stars  Futo Buta is a ramen shop that opened up in May 2015 in the South End area of Charlotte, NC.  According to their website, the chef, Michael Shortino, was introduced to the kitchen since the age of 5 with his father (who was also a chef).  His grandfather and father taught him the importance of integrity of each dish and over his culinary career, he fell in love with the high level of integrity in Japanese cuisine.  Shortino's focus for Futo Buta is on scratch-like authentic ramen, gyoza (fried dumplings), Japanese fried chicken (tori kara-v age), amami (soft serve in innovative flavor combinations), and more.  I tried the following: - Kurobuta Pork & Scallop Gyoza - loved it!  Definitely made FRESH! - Salmon Belly Nigiri - pecan wood smoked, yuzu mayo, tobiko, maple soy, micro chive - also loved it!  The Salmon Belly was super FRESH!! - Tonkotsu Ramen - pork bone broth, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, organic mushroom, onsen egg, pickled ginger, nori, sesame, black garlic - MUST GET!  I loved the pork bone broth flavor with the black garlic.  YUM!!  For dessert, it was a green tea ice cream with honey.  YUM!!    ENJOY!!",

    "text": "If you want to know whether your date is adventurous bring her here! The tiny restaurant at the corner of lynx blue line station, we ended up waiting for an hour or longer on Friday nights for a table and didn't really have the patience to get in. However trying again on a weekday, boom we got a place inside immediately. After seating you realize how tiny the restaurant is! You could be rubbing elbows with the other guests.   The menu cannot be more apt - half dozen varieties of ramen and appetizers. Reading through the description doesn't really give out any visual cues. So I would say just go with a Ramen that contains your favorite protein. Another bizzare thing I noticed was there were more waitress than the number of guests. Our waitress was helpful but seemed really busy and running around. The ramens arrived quickly. Initially uncomfortable using the chopsticks but once your work the first few rounds, you would become adept at it. For a person who doesn't hand around much Japanese cuisines, the taste was new and interesting. May not suit everyone, one of my friend couldn't stand the smell of it and had our waitress to take it away. And glad that it wasn't billed. One pro tip I learnt was to mix your ramen thoroughly before slurping. We did also try the Japanese Fried Chicken - it was another interesting appetizer. The green tea Icecream was alright too.   Be sure to walk around (visit the restrooms!), there is some interesting art work and pokemon style Graffiti. Overall an interesting and daring restaurant experience, very tiny and gets crowded on weekends. I would recommend this restaurant just for the fun of it and to get a break if you have been bored of the regular cuisines.",

The outdoor seating looked very nice but we chose to sit inside as it was hot out. the bathroom was very clean, though it was a single stall and always seemed occupied.   We ordered the Japanese fried chicken as our appetizer and it came almost immediately! Once we finished that the food came and it was amazing. We ordered the Fire & Ice, Tonkotsu, and the Little Noodle ramen. If you're used to maruchan brand packaged ramen, the Little Noodle ramen is the closest to that but much better. The food was warm but not too hot and full of flavor.   They only have chopsticks and napkins provided on the table, but our waitress asked if we needed forks almost immediately after we got our food.   The restaurant was very nice with the wood on the walls and tables and light open area, making it feel very modern. There are handy hooks beneath the tables to hang purses or bags that came in good use. I loved their method of serving water. You are given a cup and two larger glass bottles of water, first filled by your waitress. When you finish your water you can pour the rest yourself, which comes in handy for an avid water drinker.   The service was good, with our waitress taking her time to go over the menu options, giving personal suggestions along with it.   The only downfalls to this restaurant is the inconvenient location (by car). It is right outside of the Bland cats stop I believe but it is a considerable walking distance from the nearest parking. The location was also very hard to locate on a map. The address says it is on 222 E. Bland Street, but there are multiple restaurants on this address. We had to go to a tavern by the same address to get directions. Futo Buta is on the opposite corner of this location.   Overall I had a very good experience at this establishment, but had trouble getting there.",

Futo Buta is a bit hidden from the street and I can imagine that if you don't live within walking distance that you might struggle finding parking. There were a ton of people waiting outside so we almost didn't go but once inside we learned that everyone was waiting to sit in their outside seating and not in the really small interior. The hostess sat us at the bar which I found a little strange but I guess with such limited seating they have to regulate.  We ordered brussel sprouts, tofu kebabs, and the japanese fried chicken. Everything was pretty tasty but the brussel sprouts were AMAZING!! Amazing to the point where we ordered more....amazing to the point where we noticed EVERYONE around us was ordering them. The japanese fried chicken was interestingly seasoned with a spicy sauce. It kind of reminded me of chicken nuggets and sauce...nothing to write home about.   The interior of this place was nice and cozy. I'd come back just for the brussel sprouts.",

    "text": "Futo Buta, you should change your name to \"Little Bowl of Heaven\" ! We had awesome service here. We tried the pork belly buns and they were incredible. Like if you don't get those and you like pork... you are seriously missing out in life. I wish they were slightly cheaper so I could have ordered more of them.   I had the butternut ramen soup and it was divine. So rich and tasty. My husband got the Miso Hungry one and his pork was SO GOOD.  This is a fantastic place to take a date if you don't mind slurping some ramen together. Music is a little loud to talk inside.. but eating outside would be nice. Cannot wait to go back..",

The restaurant is not big so it was kind of full, but did not look crazy busy. We ordered Kurobuta Pork & Scallion Gyoza, Shishito Peppers and Toro nigiri, and we all had Buta Bowl. Izakaya dishes were fine, but Buta Bowl was a disappointment. 1. Double noodles were served in a regular size of bowl, so not enough broth made noodles soft. Could not taste the broth at all. 2. I gave my pork belly away cause they were too tough.  3. Service was way too slow and waitress never came back to checked if we needed anything else.  Overall I cannot understand why people gave 5 stars for this place.  If this place was in NYC it would never survive.",

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the broth was just salty and fatty with NO FLAVOR. After one sip of the soup I honestly couldn't drink any more of it because it was beyond disappointment, especially after some of the other reviews said it was rated one of Charlotte's top 50 restaurants and all the other hot raving reviews. Trust me if this opened in California it'd be out of business. People who says this reminds them of Japan, have you really tried ramen in Japan?!?",

However, it could be due to the fact that there is very limited seating. They've got a nice patio set up so I'm guessing there is seating out there when it's warm but for now it's pretty small.  The Ramen is delicious though! I get the Chizu which has lots of cheese and pesto (two of the best things on earth in my opinion) and we also got the Pork Belly Buns as an appetizer -- which was absolutely impeccable. They have beer, wine, and a wide assortment of Saki.  Kind of pricey but well worth it if you're a foodie.  The portion sizes of the ramen are pretty large so I can get 1.5 meals out of it. Next time I'll order ahead and do take out to avoid the wait and crowds. But I love love love this place!",

My yoga friends and I eat here all the time; sometimes once a week, and I will never get tired of it. We also love the brussel sprouts.

To be honest, when you walk into a Japanese ramen restaurant and see there is no asian chef in the kitchen, well, it is time to leave if you are a real ramen lover.  There are 3 main factors of a ramen: Broth, Noodles, Side dishes. The key of a good ramen is all about the BROTH! Without a good broth, the ramen cannot be good or even qualified as ramen. For this restaurant, I only want to give 1 star for broth(I tried the Tonkotsu). It's flavourless and it definitely makes the noodles flavourless either. When you enjoy a ramen, you want the noodle fully absorb the flavour from the broth and never want them in a seperated condition.   Secondly, the noodles are not bad, they have a springy texture. But the side dishes for ramen are pretty disappointing. In stead of adding traditional side dishes (bamboo shoots, bean sprouts) into ramen, they added some wired stuffs, like mushroom, pickled ginger into ramen. I understand their innovation or they just want to cater the locals' taste. But indeed, they make it worse and wired.  There are 3 highlights of this restaurant. 1. The atmosphere is pretty good. The place is well decorated and staffs are friendly. 2. Good smoked pork belly. It is qualified. It is flavorful, juicy and tender. 3. Impressive Green Tea Ice cream. Good flavour and it tastes rich in green tea and it has a silky and firm texture.  To make a long story short, this is not an authentic Japanese ramen restaurant. I will not recommend it to a real ramen lover.",

Review from 5/2017: My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place after grabbing a drink at Wooden Robot. It is tucked away behind the tracks and a little hard to find (Google misled us a bit). The ambiance is nice - very chill and pretty dark. I didn't love the seating because it was just the two of us and we were sat shoulder to shoulder to another couple. I was really pleased with how great the service was and how willing they were to custom my ramen order because I am allergic to pork. However, the flavor of the broth was really disappointing. I wish I could give this place more stars because they were so helpful and it was a great night but the food just wasn't that great. My boyfriend got a pork broth and he really enjoyed it - so maybe that's the trick. Enjoy!",

Food: We started with two appetizers: the pork and scallop gyoza and the smoked pork belly buns. When we took our first bite of each, we simply said \"yum.\" This was our first time trying ramen so we asked our sweet waitress for recommendations. I was safe and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen which was comforting and bursting with flavor. My boyfriend got the Fire and Ice (kimchi flavor) and he slurped that baby up.   Atmosphere: It's right on the light rail, which automatically screams hip and cool. On a beautiful day, sit outside to watch all the runners, walkers, puppies, trains, and hipstery shenanigans. Across the tracks are a bunch of restaurants and bars (Oak Room, All American, Slate Billiards, Hot Taco) so the area is buzzing with activity. During the colder months, get there early because the inside is small.   Loved it.",

I thought this would be a great place for a date, but then realized slurping up noodles from a huge bowl of steaming broth might not be the best look for a first date.  Luckily a good friend and I decided to stop by for lunch and neither of us are one to judge.  Free parking in the Post apartment garage.  Brussels sprouts, pork belly buns, ramen and soft serve were all unbelievably tasty.  Keep up the great work Futo Buta, highly recommend!",

We got the yellowtail and grapefruit appetizer (very interesting - was reconstructed sushi), the pork buns (SO GOOD), and the Fire & Ice Ramen. Virtually impossible to eat the ramen with chopsticks and I don't know why forks aren't given to people who are clearly struggling. Soda is in cans and no refills. It was nice to try this place, just for something new.",

    "text": "Soooo...Im trying to find the words to explain exactly how dope this little gem of a restaurant is.  Futo Buto brings authentic, flavorful bowls of deliciousness unlike any ever seen before in the city of Charlotte.  Let's start at the beggining.  Izakaya are, for lack of a better term, appetizers or small bites.  I always start out with Kurobuta Pork & Scallop Gyoza.  They are the best dumplings I have ever had.  Kurobuta pork is basically the Wagyu of the pork world.  Phenomenal quality meat and they are sticking it in traditional gyozas with scallops.  Insanely delicious.  I am also a huge fan of the fried brussel sprouts...never thought I'd say that in my life.  The pork belly buns are incredible as well and always round out my meal.  Ramen- First of all, the broths are truly remarkable.  A lot of love and time has to be put into building the layers of flavor that penetrate deep into my soul with every slurp.  They use alkaline noodles so the noodles never get mushy.  My favorite is the Buta Bowl.  It comes with smoked pork belly and duck confit, double noodles, corn scallions, chilli sauce and egg.  It is spicy and deep.  May be the best meal in Charlotte.  I love love love this place.",

    "text": "I've been to Futo Buta on multiple occasions during lunch. This past time was my first visit during dinner. Previously the restaurant was not that busy and I had no problems being seated. This time the small space was packed. One of the servers quoted our wait as 30-35 minutes. We were finally seated after about an hour. Very annoying.  They seemed to tell all their patrons that arrived that night the same time, so I honestly wonder if they just tell everyone that so they'll wait :-/  Regardless we were seated at the bar. Our server was awesome: just the right amount of attentiveness, great sense of humor, and very helpful. We started off with the toro nigiri appetizer. Incredible flavor; honestly doesn't even need any soy sauce!   Girlfriend ordered the tonkotsu ramen.  I love how savory it is and also a fan of the wood ear mushrooms they put in the bowl. I normally get the tonkotsu, so I decided to venture out and try the Shoyu ramen. I prefer the tonkotsu. Both bowls feature their pecan-smoked pork belly, which I absolutely adore. The pieces practically melt in your mouth. Unfortunately the broth in my ramen was too salty. From now on, I'll most likely just stick with the tonkotsu.   For dessert we had the green tea ice cream with honey drizzled on top. I'm not normally a big tea person but this was also amazing. The addition of honey really takes it to another level.   I love the ramen they serve here. I'm looking forward to future visits and trying their other appetizers (their brussel sprouts are also very good).  I just wish they would utilize their porch more or somehow find a way to expand their dining area. When it's full it's just way too crowded and very loud. Despite these problems, I still think Futo Buta is worthy of 5 stars.",

Most restaurants turn these services off during busy shifts like dinner service. I watched three door dash deliveries go out before my food arrived. These orders were placed after mine as I watched two of the cards decline when order was placed. These services bring money in and looks good for the books, however your service was backed up and table delays due to catering to delivery orders. These delays hurt your servers and makes your customers question if they return or not. The excuse of \"I'm sorry were backed up because of delivery/Togo orders\" doesn't make someone who traveled and dealt with weekend traffic to be there feel appreciated. I recommend this place and will continue to. Keep up the great food and the great service. Kill those delivery apps during dinner rush.",

The restaurant is located along the light rail on the corner beneath and apartment building.   I ordered an over-priced glass of chardonnay and enjoyed it while most of my classmates had wine or beer. Many of us ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. Frankly, I was first disappointed by the portion for $14. I expected more of everything, especially broth and protein. Second, all of my protein \"pork belly\" was the fat and none of it was meat. Legitimately no protein because the cut of pork belly was just fat.   I left the restaurant and within 20 minutes my stomach was unsettled and I got pretty sick within 40 minutes. I am not sure what is what because I have had ramen and spicy noodle soups before, but it sealed the deal over the experience.   As a lover of soup and Asian cuisine, I am quite disappointed with the experience at Futo Buta. I will try other ramen restaurants in the area and I definitely will not be rushing back, especially after getting so sick.",

I will say for those that aren't fans of raw fish, the salmon is only half cooked but it's very good.   They also had a verity of different sake's. We tried the 1000 Dreams which was very good. Smooth with a hint of sweet.   The staff was attentive and very friendly. Our guy was quick to answer any questions we had.

It's the same mediocre ramen and you could definitely get a better instant ramen than this place. The broth is tasteless and it's just overall not good. Came here a while ago and met up with my cousins who all ordered ramen. They did not like it at all and could barely eat it. The prices they charge are definitely not worth it either.   My friend also came here recently and was so upset with this place and I wasn't even surprised. He enjoys food and cooks a lot so he knows when something not good. My aunt also tried this place out but was also left disappointed saying how watery the broth is. It's a small restaurant and the food is not worth it I'm telling you.   It's just trendy and the people giving this place good reviews probably haven't had real good ramen.   So unless you aren't use to asian cuisine and enjoy a more Americanized version try this place but if you want something better just get some instant ramen lmao.",

    "text": "Arrived in Charlotte and knew I wanted to check Futo Buta out. Sadly, with a busy schedule it took 3 days before I could actually get here with numerous attempts on trying to trek out on previous days. Top it off with the weird parking situation which confused us out of towners and a little hike to get to the restaurant made for a very distraught traveler. So you have to be something to literally turn a frown upside down.  We came in, no one really gave us any info on what to do, no signs off the bat to say seat yourself (not that we saw immediately??). A group came in after us and promptly seated themselves so we followed along. And that's were grumpy town ended. From the waitstaff to the food to the impromptu double rainbow outside. I mean, it was a great way to end a very stressful work weekend.  What we got: Eggplant buns - Good. Not my favorite of the things we ordered but being a veggie bun I cannot complain! A bit greasy.  Duck confit buns - Yes, yes, yes! Would order this again and definitely recommend. Greasy as well-- but so good.  Tonkotsu - I think it was good? I didn't order this, and the friend who did didn't complain/said it was nice. Looked like a good traditional ramen.  Niwa - This was interesting. Probably the prettiest of the three we ordered. Lots of veg, a peanut-y and savory broth. Might consider this for myself if I ever come here again.  Fire and Ice - Can't go wrong. Bit of dashi and a sweet gochujang coupling. Pretty presentation. I imagine this wouldn't be as preferred for ramen lovers who prefer their ramen on the salty side. Underneath the fresh veg was a treasure--- delicious glazed salmon on a bed of nice noodles. Would be a tough contender for round 2!  Waitress was super nice to us and I appreciate the energy. Plus we all kinda ran out (some of the staff included) of the restaurant right after we ordered to gawk at a double rainbow. Was a really awesome experience.  If you need your spice they have several options available too!  Parking-- There is street parking a little ways down from the restaurant and supposedly a parking deck. We couldn't find the deck for it until after we left. Either way we had to do a little bit of walking. Really nice area though. If you're from Atlanta-- it's a lot like our Beltline but add a train and more trees.  Atmosphere-- The restaurant is a little cramped. We were lucky to find seating, but they also have a patio. Very cool aesthetic overall.  Anyways, thanks for the awesome end to my trip Futo Buta!",

    "text": "This ramen place is conveniently located right off of the Bland St. light rail station. The music was really loud inside the restaurant so my coworker and I decided to sit outside, which is a nice patio area.  Since this place is called Futo Buta (\"Fat Pig\"), I thought I should try something with pork belly. We ended up ordering the tofu skewers to start and I had the miso ramen as my main dish. The presentation of the meal is good, and makes it look pretty authentic. I like the fact that they make their noodles here but wish that the noodles are a little more chewy. The broth was OK, like many other yelpers mentioned, the soup isn't very salty, which I don't mind so much, but it's not very super flavorful overall and is definitely on the greasy side. The pork belly was good and looked appetizing, but also not as flavorful as chashu pork should be (it didn't feel like the pork absorbed the flavors). I did enjoy the corn they added in the ramen, which was very sweet.  I think it's unique that they do soft serve here (although a bit pricey, $5 for an order), but super awesome when it's a hot sunny day. We ended up ordering each a soft serve and tried both the strawberry banana and yuzu mango flavors they had that day. I preferred the yuzu mango flavor because the yuzu gives it a nice uplifting citrus taste to the mango's tropical flavors.   We had a very filling meal and the total came out be about ~$25  per person.",

After nice long hot yoga session, I overheard some ladies chatting about this place so I decided to give it a try.  What better way to spend a cold raining night than with a nice hot bowl of deliciousness. I did take out and attempted to call ahead but the phone to the restaurant didn't seem to be working. When I arrived, I was immediately acknowledged by one of the servers, which was nice considering how busy they were.  The place is tiny so def not for large groups but absolutely a cute place for date night with a friend or boo!  I ordered the seasonal vegan butternut squash ramen, a ramen bowl for my husband with chicken and some pork belly buns... you know, for the ride home. My vegan ramen was super duper flavorful but a little too salty and I wasn't prepared for the thick texture of the broth but it was tasty.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his ramen as well. The buns were tasty too but there was something creamy on them that I would probably next time ask that they leave off. Overall tasty and I am anxious to try more items on the menu",

Most of what we ordered was delicious! We ordered the pork belly baos, the salmon belly, the tonkotsu ramen, and the miso ramen. If you are ever stumped between the two, go for the miso ramen. Hands down. The tonkotsu wasn't bad but it just wasn't buttery enough to be a tonkotsu in my opinion. If you do get the miso, try adding mushrooms to it and extra pork.",

I've tried to be adventurous and try different ramens (for example, the butternut miso), but I always come to the same conclusion: that I should have ordered the Miso. The pork and chicken broth give the dish a wonderful flavor, while the sweet white corn, pecan smoked pork belly and onsen egg provide an array of different textures and taste. If you're looking to try a few highly recommended appetizers, I would suggest the edamame, rice crispy squares and Kurobuta pork & scallop gyoza.

    "text": "After delaying for over a year to give this place a shot, my wife and I finally pulled the trigger. Part of the delay in trying this CLT hotspot was because of the ever-present consistently long line, and the other part was because I had the mentality of \"I don't want to pay $12-$14 for a bowl of soup\".   On Friday, it was chilly in the Queen City (a blamy 65 degrees, brr) so I decided soup sounded nice, so I walked on over to the Futo. It was as if the stars aligned for us, and there was NO WAIT... on a Friday ... at 8pm. I knew right then that this was a marvelous occasion.   In honor of the stars aligning, we opted for an appetizer to kick off our meal. We saw a lot of people ordering the Rice Crispy Squares (many people said they're amazing, so we're definitely trying them next go-round), but ended up with the steam buns. BONUS: they let you mix & match (2 for $10), so we got 1 duck confit & 1 smoked pork belly. Both delicious but, flavor wise, the pork belly was a clear winner with an awesome kick to it.   After perusing our handy Yelp app, it seemed like the overwhelming consensus was favored towards the 'Fire & Ice' bowl. Because we always 'split' meals in order to maximize our tasting abilities, I decided my next best option would be the Miso (Hungry) bowl. And because, meat ... I had to go with the recommendation of adding the spicy ground pork.   Both bowls came out to my surprise, my wife & I both said the Miso bowl was hands down the better bowl. So, much, flavor. Seriously, it was insane. I like it spicy, but not like \"ughhh\" spicy, and this was perfect. The waitress told me the spice all comes from that added pork, so do yourself a favor and make this your go-to bowl.   Long story long --- this place is a must try.",

I was planning to write a great review tonight but in the modest of me writing this review a friend called me. He said, \"turn on the news that restaurant you went to tonight is on WBTV restaurant scorecard!\" I immediately felt nauseous but tuned in because I was just in the phone sharing with him that the food was good but mine and Stefannys stomach was hurting about 20mins after our meal.  After watching the review on WBTV it probably was from the pork being placed on the floor of the kitchen in buckets. Or maybe it was from the chefs not wearing the proper protective gear for their facial hair while cooking and hair. Or maybe from the undercooked food. They had a score of a 91 -A, and that's absolute nasty! I doubt I'll be returning, but if you want to see the video check out WBTV restaurant scorecard. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wcnc.com%2Fmobile%2Farticle%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fpopular-restaurants-score-low-a-grades%2F499835694&s=4be4dcff3bbbf4fbb3422ec71a047b8655cb7172f250fe3e6a7b0cfc8d8ea611\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wcnc.com/mobile/article/...</a> From the article: Also up this week on the report card is Futo Buta. They too were handling raw chicken with their bare hands. Bare hand contact with your food is never allowed.  One employee working with ready-to-eat food wasn't wearing his beard net and some of their buckets of soup, pigs feet and broth all being stored on the floor.  Their grade here at Futo Buta, a 91, another low \"A\".   I really hope Futo Buta has made changes since this was featured.",

I will have to be honest and let you know my Saturday visit was pretty disappointing and makes me think about returning. This was my first time sitting at the bar so we had a clear view of the chef at the window who seemed to be adding finishing spices, cheese, etc.  To keep this short this man should not do that without gloves and reaching directly into the food before putting it on the ramen. Everyone else had gloves and the worst thing is then he's texting on his freaking phone and then goes back to grabbing food to put in patron's food. Then it was also nice to see him wipe his nose on his arm. As I write this is makes me see how truly disgusting this was and am glad I am bringing this to your attention as I would think that behavior will dissuade customers from returning. It did me and my date.  Mike Sigmon",

    "text": "UPDATING MY REVIEW FROM 4 STARS TO 5 STARS. First time I came here, the ramen was WAY too salty. Especially with seaweed, pork belly, and whatever else is in your bowl, the broth cannot also be salty because then it just tastes like saltwater. I came back after OVER ONE YEAR giving them a chance to show me that the hype is actually real and they hold True to what good ramen is.   I got the Shoyu, and as a person who does not like pork belly, I ate all of it. The thing I hate most is the fatty smell and taste, but the pecan smoked pork belly really masked that smell and flavor that I do not particularly enjoy. I tried some of the salmon from the Fire and Ice, PHENOMENAL. I wish it came with the onsen egg though. The flavor was great and was well seasoned. We ended our meal with Black Sesame Ice Cream, which is a hit or miss for everyone. I particularly love Black Sesame and the presentation was so cute. The waitresses and waiters are nothing but kind, greeting you immediately as you walk in and saying their thank yous and goodbyes as you leave. Absolutely impeccable, and compliments to the Chef.",

    "text": "To think that you will walk away from Futo Buta with leftovers is laughable. I've been waiting for a ramen shop to come to Charlotte that can rival those in LA and those that I have been to throughout my travels in Asia, and Futo Buta is that shop. Let's start with the broth, since that's the foundation of any successful ramen shop. Futo Buta has a creamy beef broth that smells like pickled ginger and a generous amount of sesame oil, and has a nice heat that sits right at the back of your mouth and warms your entire soul. The noodles are buttery with the right amount of chewiness and the toppings... get the pork belly... it melts in your mouth and it's incredible.   What else do I need to say about Futo Buta? Just that their staff makes you feel like you're a valued regular, even though this was my first visit! I will absolutely be returning and cannot wait to try their specialty plates. For those who want to try, which I hope you do, make sure to park in the public garage under Post's apartments and then walk to the light rail. It's Charlotte's little hidden gem that offers an alternative to the abundance of southern comfort food in South End.",

We went with a group of seven and pretty much rotated the dishes around the table. Highlights for me were obviously the Miso (Hungry) ramen bowl, pan fried dumplings and rice crispy squares. By the end of the meal, we were all beyond stuffed! In fact, one of us literally went into a food coma at the table...True story! We finished the meal with the strawberry basil soft serve which can only be described best by my husband as \"happiness in a cup.\"  The only con I can give about this place, is that it is in much need of a wheel chair access point. We noticed a lady in a wheel chair trying to get into the restaurant but was unsuccessful without assistance.",

Places in Charlotte just didn't have it or did and it wasn't the same.  This restaurant is turning the tides for restaurants in South End particularly. Extra bonus is that this is walking distance from my cycling studio and it's nice to have good food in my reach instead of so much bar food and fast food restaurants.  Try the rice crispy squares.  I don't love seafood or sushi, but these are awesome.  Those and the Shoyu Ramen (add spicy ground pork) are my go-to's.",

The ramen is delicious and can be served spicy or not spicy, depending on your tastes.  The pork belly is fantastic.  Pork buns are really great, too.  On top of that, they have their own soft-serve, which I believe was ginger flavored when I first popped in! I didn't try it, but it sounded amazing.  The location is a bit tricky if you don't know where you're looking.  It's in the Post South End apartment building (the same one with Crepe Cellar and what used to be World of Beer), facing the light rail on the Bland Street Station, on the far corner of the building away from Bland Street.  My single, solitary complaint seems to be a common one - the place is just too expensive for lunch.  I totally understand that I'm paying for high quality food, but I wouldn't at all mind a pared down, cheaper lunch menu.   That would get me coming back more often.  (And if the chef wanted to start serving breakfast, I'd probably be there for that, too.  It's really good.)",

    "text": "I've come back a few times a few months later. Much improved and now I'm hooked. Love their Fire & Ice. Lots of flavor and very filling. Go with extra broth and add an onsen egg :) Try to go early to beat the lunch and dinner rush. You usually get seated immediately if you do so or you'll wait a good 15+ mins. Seating is tight, still no hooks to hang coat or bag. Music genre is random and loud at times.  Old review when they first opened: 3 stars...for now. UGH. I know. I will be back... they need to work on some kinks, hopefully before their grand opening. It also doesn't help that I was already mentally comparing Futo Buta to Ippudo NYC and Momofuku. Just reading the menu reminded me of Ippudo's items. Upon entering, the place is cozy, small. I can only imagine the wait once they start picking up. Love the decor which reminded me of Momofuku's and a little bit of Toki Underground and Daikaya in D.C.. They could use some hooks underneath the bar and community table for purses, bags and jackets. I ended up pulling my purse handle up my leg to secure it. Staff is really friendly. While waiting for our food I noticed a few customers take their left over ramen to-go. WHAT?! Who does that??? Immediately my husband said, ratio is off, too much noodles, not enough broth. Once we got our ramen, I realized that was that was very True. I ordered the Niwa (vegan) and hubster ordered the Fire & Ice (salmon). For appetizers we ordered Shishito pepper and the Eggplant Buns. Here we go:  * Shishito Peppers - Best thing we ordered from the menu. We enjoyed every Bite of it. Flavorful, made us want more. * Eggplant Buns - Fail. TWICE. First time, the buns came very chewy and undercooked. Second go, same but just barely undercooked. Eggplant itself was tasty. * Niwa - Could use a little more flavor. Noodle texture was perfect. You can tell they were homemade and fresh. Too much noodle, not enough broth. Plenty of veggies in there. * Fire & Ice - Salmon is smoked which gave it that earthy flavor but it was too salty and maybe a little too smoky as well. Cooked perfectly. Too much noodle, not enough broth. Fresh noodles.   Overall, it was fine, underwhelming. As I mentioned earlier, a few kinks and fine tuning and this place will be great. Can't wait to come back.",

Futo Buta is located next to the train track, in a cool area of downtown Charlotte.  The train runs through downtown and sidewalks are located on either side to encourage pedestrian traffic.  It seemed very safe and truly a great way of getting a taste of local life.  I walked in and was seated at the bar.  The waitress eagerly told me about the menu and answered my questions.  In the end, I asked her to \"surprise me\", and that she did:-)  Another waiter returned in good time with a piping hot bowl of Fire and Ice.  The bowl included ramen  noodles swimming in a seafood broth, top with pieces of grilled salmon and steamed vegetables.  It was beautiful, flavorful, and filling.  I was offered samples of ice cream; green tea, drizzled with honey, and \"Fruity Pebbles\", a pink, citrus flavored soft-serve, topped with fruity pebbles.  They were both delicious, and quite different from each other.    The wait staff was friendly and took time to suggest places to see in Charlotte and directions on how to get there.    Overall, a wonderful experience that I would recommend for a casual meal.",

Each one of them really enjoyed the entire experience.  Had the Rice Kristy treat appetizers which was amazing! The perfect amount of crunch, tuna, and heat make it a great starter.  I ordered the Miso (Hungry) with the upgraded $2 spicy pork. Wow... I've been to some great ramen places across the US and this was easily the best bowl I've ever had.

    "text": "Again on our quest to find the best Ramen my husband and I saw this place had opened recently and had to give it a try. (Again Nikki, your posts of Ramen are such a tease.) After parking and walking around, the place can be a bit tricky to find so don't get discouraged!, we found the front door!   We sat at the bar since the inside is quite small and it was a little warm outside. We were immediately greeted by our waiter and submitted our order. I got the Miso (hungry) and my husband got the Tonkatsu. It didn't take long for our orders to come out and we were super excited!   They only gave us chopsticks, and truth-be-told I am not a chopsticks master. At one point my husband laughed so loud that the waitstaff said the food must be very good for such a big smile. He ousted me, and they seemed to appreciate my effort, and promptly handed me a fork. Hey! I tried!   It was very good Ramen, once I was actually able to get a big bite. It had great flavor, which mine was very different from the place we frequently last. I would give this place a try if I was a Ramen fiend like we are.   Our bill was around $30ish after tip, but well worth it.",

We did not order these but our neighbor at the shared table insisted we try them.  Our neighbor to the other side insisted we try their chicken...it too was fabulous.  We made good friends (even though I was old enough to be everyones mother in the place).  Also had the Miso Ramen which was very really yummy. Next time I will try it with the spicy pork as Frankie G says.  Lastly we had the Waygu Carpacio...OMG...it was fabulous.  Definitely will be back!!",

I ordered the beet salad and it was delicious, especially the dressing. I also loved the candied walnuts and dates in the salad - scrumptious to say the least. I asked for chicken on my salad and was given a side dish of cold poached chicken. It was alright, I prefer grilled chicken but this was fine too. I also split a miso ramen bowl with my father because we wanted to try what the restaurant was known for. It was good, pretty flavorful with the addition of the egg. I enjoyed my meal. Futo Buta is a great place to go if you are looking for some ramen.",

Service- Pretty good! attentive, courteous, pretty knowledgeable, and personable. Ambiance- My gf and I sat outside. it was nice, not too loud, and good for people watching. Price- price was good! two people, drinks, apps, and entree was about &$50. keep in mind though, this isn't two ribeyes, this is bowls of noodle soup. Selection- This is why it wasn't 5 stars. there were only about 6ish ramen choices, and they weren't all that different from each other. I'm basing this on other restaurants that serve ramen, that had some different protein options than Futo has. a somewhat limited selection is why I'm giving Futo Buta a 4.",

As others have said, this is a bit hard to find, as it has no direct road access.  But having made a few wrong turns on South Boulevard and Tryon Street, I eventually got there.  The place is small and I sat at the bar...and, yes, the stools at the bar are a bit awkward to get in and out of.  But that truly is my only complaint.  I 'fessed up to the server that I knew virtually nothing about Japanese food.  I also told him that I am mostly a vegetarian.  He steered me to the veggie ramen dish (it is the one right below Fire and Ice on the menu).  What a great choice.  The bowl was full of noodles and veggies with a broth second to none.  The server also explained the four different spices/oils he gave me and what sort of flavor each would produce.  Again, he was spot on.  Yes, for $12, the bowl was a bit pricey.  But I left the place quite full and quite satisfied.  I  cannot wait to go back.",

It's cozy in a very authentically Japanese way (based on my limited experience anyway). Everything is awesome. I dream of their salmon belly nigiri at night. Actually thinking of it now, and knowing I can't get it at the moment is making me tear up a bit. It's velvety smooth salmon that's smoked lightly in- house using pecan wood smoke. Because it's gently smoked, it retains its moist fatty texture, rather than getting more stiff and solid. The smoke isn't overwhelming either, so the clean flavor of the salmon definitely shines through. The ramen is complex. This is as close to the real thing I've found since my last trip to Hokkaido. If you're a ramen beginner, I suggest asking to hold the onsen egg. It may be a texture that you're not prepared for yet, but if you're adventurous, get the egg and add the spicy pork!",

The portion was small, egg wasn't fully cooked (personal preference), the ginger didn't offset the sweetness of the broth as expected, instead it stood out. The noodles were self made I believe they were the better ones I've had. We also ordered the eggplant buns, which was awesome, it was tasty but can't imagine myself enjoying it more with the second one. The green tea softy was great, with a touch of honey on the top, it wasn't over the top sweet and enjoyed it. The hoppy beer I had was something ends with \"robot\", it was good, reminded me of Magic Hat (forgot the number) immediately. The wait staffs might have been students who study nearby were super nice to us, extra accommodating being we had a baby :) thank you.  I still strongly recommend this place. I am spoiled being from Jersey/NY :)",

I will say that I am a LA ramen lover and I haven't been anywhere that is as good as my favorite LA ramen shop but Futo Buta definitely gives a good effort. I tried their typical pork broth ramen which I though was lacking in flavor but their Fire and Ice ramen was awesome!! There was salmon and spicy and the flavors were great. Absolutely recommend it. Also got pork belly buns to start which was really good but I thought was a bit expensive for what it was. Overall, good food if you choose well, nice ambience and character but would expect to wait.",

The menu and the drink selection are small -- no poring over dozens of competing choices. I very observantly don't even remember which draft beer I had, but it was something delicious and golden. The tonkatsu ramen was very earthy and delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying the other kinds. Being that seating is kind of tight, I got to know the people at the next table much better than one usually gets to know one's dining neighbors. They had the crispy rice and tuna appetizer, which I will definitely try next time because it looked yummy, but they also experienced the downside of not getting one of their bowls of ramen delivered until well after everything else at the table had been eaten and drunk. I tried the cherry/chili/pork ice cream because it was such a weird idea that someone had to try it, and actually it was quite delicious.",

Conveniently located along the light rail at the Bland Street stop (northbound side), this small, cozy space was welcoming after a chilly stroll around South End. We arrived shortly after 5pm, which was good timing before it got crowded, and were sat right away. Our waitress was helpful in explaining the menu, different types of ramen, and assisting my sister who is gluten free (she could order any ramen bowl and relpace the noodles with rice, which she enjoyed). I ordered the tonkotsu, which is as close to traditional ramen as one can get. It was so good and reminded me of Japan! The bowl is plenty of food, as I was unable to finish it (but of course made sure I didn't leave any of the pork belly). It is a popular spot among my co-workers and friends familiar with South End, and I'm excited to go back and try more of the ramen bowls.",

In addition to dining in, they have to-go service, which also operates flawlessly. This place has one of the best staffs in Charlotte (or anywhere, for that matter).

    "text": "I'm really curious if the owner chef seriously believes his ramen tastes good. If so, I don't have anything to say, because after all, this is his restaurant and he has every right to serve whatever he thinks right.  I just want to say that tonkotsu ramen tastes \"off\" as ramen. The soup is salty but just salty and has no flavor. Miso is a little better, because the taste of miso adds some flavor. Onsen tamago is not for ramen toppings, but for breakfast. Japanese don't eat raw bean sprouts.  They look like ramen, but they taste like totally different in a bad way. Like, it is cooked by someone who has seen ramen somewhere, but never tasted nor been trained and tries to recreate it from his memory. Frozen bag of tonkotsu ramen tastes way better as authentic ramen.  I gave it up with ramen and tried spicy tuna don. It was over priced for dried minced tuna with spicy sauce on top of cold sushi rice.   Ramen is not healthy food. It shouldn't be. It has to have full of sodium, full of lard.",

    "text": "Futo Buta's dishes has a very casual asian fusion approach, which I really like. We both ordered the ramen (can't remember the names of it but it was the first and the third one on the menu). I opt for the pork broth instead of the chicken and it was very thick and flavourful. The pork belly was amazing!! It had the right texture and amount of fats. For dessert, we each had the mango and green tea soft serve. I would say it's a little pricey for something so simple but it was a refreshing end to our big servings of ramen.  Overall, it's a good place for some trendy asian food and would really like to try more things on the menu if I ever come down to Charlotte again!",

The tuna was fresh and seasoned nicely, presentation was wonderful. I had the Tonkatsu pork broth with pork belly and it was full of veggies and loaded with flavor.  My wife enjoyed the Niwa vegan broth with veggies, wonderful as well. I finished all mine and was jealous when she had leftovers a little later in the day.  We will be back often!",

I had the Shishito peppers as an appetizer which were very tasty. Then a pork belly roll (mini sandwich), also great. Finally the Totonku ramen which had the 20 hour cooked broth. It was meaty, fatty, and delicious. Perfectly cooked egg, not hard, but right at the point before hardening.   Sure it's not health food but hey, good food like this in moderation is OK. Life is nothing without its little pleasures. I'm very happy with my new little pleasure.",

    "text": "Well, firstly the location of Futo Buta is perfect- right off the light rail (30 second walk from Bland Street station), the neighborhood is one of the best in CLT and what I loved most of all, is that it was \"off-the-beaten-track\" as it was't on any road. We were planning on riding the light rail, but it was closed for construction.   When we went (12/20/15) it was quite busy with only one table left or seats at the bar avaliable- get the seats to the right of the bar, you can see into the kitchen and talk to the very friendly and enthusiastic staff.  The waitress serving was very helpful in describing the and recommending dishes on the menu, she was very talkative and down to earth. We didn't order any sake or alcohol but there was a large selection, other drinks were Coca-Cola products or flavored San Pellegrino. It would have been brilliant if they had Japanese sodas such as Ramune.   On to the food, we ordered two appetizers- Tori Kara Age (Japanese fried chicken) and the Low Country Smoked Pork Belly Buns. The buns were very good as the pork just melted in your mouth and the gochujang BBQ sauce was tangy and complimented the dish perfectly. The fried chicken was light and crispy and came with a chili aioli, which had a small kick to it.   We ordered the Tonkotsu ramen- warning it's big, we shared it (between two) and we still couldn't finish it. The broth was so good, you could feel it going down your throat and warming you up. the onsen egg was very good, I tried it before in Korean ramen but never in Japanese. The only very minor complaint I have, is that there were only 3 pieces of pork in the ramen- and it wasn't cheap, so for $14 I wasn't that impressed with the amount of pork.   And finally we tried the Japanese soft serve, which was very large as well. The flavor changes daily, but we had Black Sesame plus Ginger and Peach swirled together, it was the perfect way to finish such as good meal.",

    "text": "Futo Buta was a hard place to find. We almost gave up, but thanks to the tip of a yelp review, we parked at the garage of one the apartment complexes. The restaurant was right around the corner.  On to the food... I ordered their Miso Ramen. The broth was good and so was the pork belly. I thought that ramen and bbq flavored pork belly was an odd pairing though. The egg was also slightly undercooked for my liking. The texture of the noodles was a little off for me as well - maybe too much egg? I couldn't quite pinpoint what it was. Overall, a good bowl of ramen and deceptively filling. I thought the bowl was small, but there was a decent portion of ramen noodles in my bowl. My kids loved their Little Noodle Ramen. My pickiest eater kept coming back for more broth.  My favorite dish of the night was their pork belly buns. Surprising, since I usually don't like pork belly. The flavors were spot on. Bummed that I had to share with my husband. Next time, I'll order my own. My kids also enjoyed their Japanese Fried Chicken appetizer.  I'm a fan of all things green tea, so I ordered their green tea soft-serve ice cream for dessert. They topped it with some honey, and it was delicious! I would come back just for that.  Their ramen was far from the best I've ever had, but I still enjoyed my meal.",

    "text": "This place is SO overrated.   I am beyond shocked at all of the four and five-star reviews, which were the initial reason I decided it was worth a shot while on a short weekend trip to Charlotte.   The place was packed and there was a long wait (but that was understandable and it was dealt with in a friendly manner). There was a rustic, trendy vibe inside, and a lot of outdoor seating. There were manga-style cartoons on the bathroom doors and beautiful plating. I am pretty sure the place's style and branding is what most of the hype is about because...  THIS WAS THE MOST BLAND RAMEN I'VE HAD IN A WHILE!  If my boyfriend and I hadn't ordered spicy beef to be added to our tonkatsu ramen (making the ramen an overpriced $16) the broth would have had NO FLAVOR AT ALL. For me, ramen is all about the broth. But this broth was so light. It had no depth and no layers. It was completely void of any comforting ramen flavors. I almost didn't even bother eating it, but I was hungry since our appetizer - while good quality - was super small for the price (four pieces of sushi for $10!!!).   The meat was dry and there was a very small amount for the price point. Usually ramen will have a few pieces of main meat and then some other types or parts of the meat to give it some more heft. But I literally got two small chunks of dry pork belly with a ton of fat and no flavor except for the outer skin. The egg was also undercooked and still cold, which made it unsettling in texture. The ramen noodles themselves were also not authentic and had a doughy thick texture, rather than the slick feeling of a flavor-soaked ramen noodle.   I am wondering if some of the other ramen flavors were a bit more interesting.   The couple next to me had brought their own hot sauce and dumped it on their chicken wing appetizer, which is probably another sign that this place is lacking in flavor for anyone who likes more than a bland broth.   I was super disappointed, but I have only went once. Maybe some of their other ramen have a bit more to offer, but from my one experience I would say it was super underwhelming and overrated.",

One day it's piled with veggies on top and another day it's just some sprouts and carrots.

I was visiting with someone who you to work there and even they stated the Vegan broth should not be oily  and that both were not right.  A bit concerned I actually got a meat based broth.

It's right on the LYNX blue line so there's a lot going on in the area. It's tough to find parking so it's best to scout the area before heading out. The front of the restaurant is facing the tracks so you won't be able to see it if you're trying to find it. You have to walk before you see it.  I suggest you go with multiple people and have everyone get something different so you can try everything. There are so many different things on the menu it was hard not ordering it all.

We were seated at the bar and promptly ordered from an attentive server behind the counter. We started with the Toro nigiri, and I can still savor the taste after two days. Super fresh, didn't even need more than a drop of soy sauce. I tried the tonkatsu ramen, and the flavor is all there. So much umami! Bowl contained two slices of pork belly, egg, mushrooms, nori, and some black fungus. Ramen was bouncy, and broth was rich. Finished off with the green tea ice cream drizzled in honey. Really enjoyed the taste of green tea, but the ice cream itself had a little icy consistency for a soft serve. The honey really complemented the tea flavor though, so I'd get the dessert again any day, especially at the end of such a savory meal.",

I even called the restaurant and they told me to look for an apartment complex with a garage.  The Apartment complex was not signed and it took a long time to finally find it.   Once there, we sat outside next to the light rail and busy walkway.  I was glad to sit outside because the inside seating was high benches that appeared uncomfortable.  Sitting outside felt like being in a bustling city with bikers and runners and walkers and trains.  The menu here shouted Asian Fusion with Ramen noodles.  It might have shouted some sushi too, but in all fairness, I am not a sushi fan and didn't pay much attention to that part of the menu. I had a vegan bowl that was heavy on noodles and light on everything else.  I added poached chicken.  It was good, but the flavor was nothing to write home about.  The black tea was weak and not good. I asked for sweet and low, but got a small bottle of simple syrup instead.  They never offered any refills. Now for the great part.  Never do I order desserts, but when they offered cinnamon fig ice cream, I was all in. It was served in a little cup with a little wooden spoon, but every bite was heaven sent.   This place is ultra trendy, but not a place I would frequent. For me, Ramen noodles helped define my college days.  That was a long time ago and I have probably had my fill of those noodles.  If anything would get me back, it would be the ice cream.  It really did almost make me scream.",

Crispy fried Brussel sprouts and perfect little fried pieces of chicken called Tori Kara Age to start, followed by the Shoyu (Good Time) - smoked pork belly, a poached egg, leeks, and noodles floating in a generous bowl of delicious broth. The pork belly was perfectly cooked, and when I broke the egg yolk, it added a creaminess to the broth. The dish names had me giggling like a 12-year-old boy, but that bowl definitely showed me a helluva good time!   Such a good time that I filled up on appetizers and ramen, leaving no room for dessert. DON'T DO THAT. Get a few to-go boxes and try the soft serve ice cream. I'm not sure when I'll be in Charlotte next, but not getting dessert at Futo Buta will haunt me until then. (This Public Service Announcement is brought to you by regret.)   OK, I can't talk about the food anymore, I'm salivating just thinking about it. So, atmosphere - this place was definitely trendy, inside and out. It was too hot to eat outside, but there seemed to be plenty of seating and shade. The tables inside were a little smaller, but we never felt crowded. Water was served in tall glass decanters, and our server was quick to refill the water and clear empty plates.   If you're not familiar with the place, it can be a little difficult to find - my coworker and I parked on South Blvd. and walked down Bland Street, following the railroad tracks until we reached our destination. It's less than a stone's throw from the Bland Street light rail station and is right across from Hot Taco (another great eatery my coworker and I tried and recommend).",

If you didnt know already, there are different types of ramen and they also vary in style depending on region. But one of my favorites is the Tonkatsu Ramen. I had this here and have seriously been craving it ever since. It might not be the most authentic ramen place but from my experience having a lot of authentic ramen in Japan or here, I would say it is pretty close. Good Japanese ramen is supposed to be a little salty and they do a good job on the broth. Very flavorful and rich. Chasu or pork belly has got some smokey flavor which my husband loved. It was a perfect mix of fat and meat so it was awesome.The noodles were also not too soft or hard. I wish they had Takoyaki balls as their appetizer. We love them!   Price point was good.  Service is always understanding and attentive. This place is small and if you come at a time when there is a lot of people you would have wait a while for a table but I assure you that the wait would be worth it as after eating a bowl of their ramen you stomach will be satisfy. Food came out quite quick for us as we came at the perfect timing between rushes.  I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said about this place. Seating is very limited, but it's certainly worth the wait.",

First this place is like Asian fusion rather than a traditional ramen shop, which is fine just now how friends had explained it to me.   Visited on a Friday night and they had a wait. We put our name on the list for a table but noticed the back bar was empty minus one girl sitting alone. Twenty minutes goes by and they call us to sit at the bar that had been empty from the get go?!? Why make us wait?   Ordered the shoyu which was decent, but a bit too salty and could use some extra flavor. The egg inside was to die for without a doubt. Would definitely come back, but probably not on a weekend.  Pro-tip: try to sit outside or bring a jacket because they keep this place super cold!",

    "text": "Futo Buta makes ~miso~ happy. This place is seriously one of my all-time favorite restaurants. My very favorite bowl of ramen is the vegan butternut squash ramen, and I add corn (recommended by the waitress the first time I ordered it, and it's worth it). This is a seasonal menu item, but they seem to have it a lot. It's so flavorful and has great texture from the cauliflower, mushrooms, and other toppings. It's my benchmark for judging all other ramen, and it might be my choice for a last meal because it's so good.   My dad (my usual ramen date) always orders the Miso and adds spicy pork. It's on the spicy side to me, but it's reliably good. The Chizu is an accessible (and delicious) option with all of the cheese and would be a good choice for people who are unsure of what to try. The only ramen that I haven't enjoyed is the Fire and Ice.   The rice crispy squares are a must order for me each visit. The squares of rice are warm with a crispy exterior, which complements the raw tuna perfectly. The brussels sprouts are tasty. We've tried the pork belly buns once, and I wouldn't order them again (but I'm not a huge pork belly fan). The soft-serve is a good end to the meal. My favorite flavor has been the strawberry-basil, but it rotates regularly. The draft beer list features some local options, and they also have sake and sake cocktails.   The service is always great, and I usually recognize some of the same workers from previous visits. Seating can be difficult as this restaurant tends to get busy. They don't take reservations and your entire party has to be present to be seated. I like sitting outside here if the weather is nice because it feels less crowded than indoors. Check this place out if you haven't already!",

There was about a 20 minute wait, but you get a text when your table is ready, so we were able wander the streets a bit while we waited. Inside the restaurant is cramped, everyone is almost shoulder to shoulder. It isn't the most comfortable seating, but everyone is certainly fighting for a seat! If a ramen restaurant has a wait time in the hot-humid-90 degree North Carolina summer, it has gotta be good.   We got the A5 Wagyu Tataki to start, the Fire & Ice Ramen and their Seasonal Ramen Hiyashi Buta. The Fire & Ice Ramen was on the saltier side, but the smoked salmon was done really well and my ramen craving was definitely satified. Their cold noodle dish, the Hiyashi Buta, was spicy with a generous amount of what I would describe as a thicker Asian Vinagrette. Perfect if you're craving noodles on a hot summer night.  Unfortunately, my boyf was the one who ordered the cold noodles, so I could only steal a few bites... I will be ordering this on my next visit!",

I love the layout of this place but please know that if you have an aversion to people and intimate spaces, this is not the place for you. The tables are either shared or so close together they may as well be. It does not bother us but it may bother some.   I have had the vegan ramen (Niwa) with tofu and black garlic oil added and the pork belly ramen (Tonkotsu). They are both very delicious for very different reasons. In both bowls, the protein was perfectly executed and the broth was flavorful. We always ask for the spice tray and add extra noodles and it makes it the perfect bowl of goodness with leftovers to boot. I think my favorite from a foodie perspective is the pork belly. Perfectly cooked pork belly melts in your mouth. The broth is rich and the onsen egg  gives it a nice creaminess.    We always finish the meal with the green tea and honey ice cream. It is a bit pricey at $6 but worth it and a perfect end to a delicious meal.    I will definitely be returning again and again and I've already recommended this place to others who also enjoy their experience. Give 'em a try.",

    "text": "I love ramen and generally all noodle dishes, but especially the flavor of ramen. I still don't understand why there are so few ramen shops in Charlotte, but Futo Buta dominates this market.  I've been here a few times. It's a great location off the light rail which is how I usually get there. However, it is small and has some shared tables. Also I don't find the seating comfortable.    The food, however, is amazing. From sushi to buns to ramen to ice cream, It's all good. My suggestion is to start with pork belly buns. Great flavor in a soft bun. Then of course try the ramen. There's various types. My latest trip I got the hiyashi buta which are cold noodles. It comes with spicy pork, pork belly and an egg. The sauce comes on the side with this one so you get to pour the savory goodness all over the noodles yourself. The spicy pork made the dish for me. This is excellent for the hot Charlotte days.  The ice cream is small, but delicious.   I think the pricing could be brought down a little. It's not horrible, but ramen in other cities costs less. I just look at it as I'm treating myself.   Service is okay. They always seem busy. I've been in for dine-in and carry-out. For carryout, there was a group of us, but they took orders for one person, then took care of a table. Then a different person would take the next order. Overall, it just seemed rushed with no time for pleasantries.    However, if you have the craving for ramen, this is a very good option!",

As far as non noddle means Items I love the pork belly buns and the ice cream is always a great ending. Yea I know ice cream before I return to my dramatic wind scene outside...food doesnt have to make sense or rather I don't! In the end my point is go, you wont regret it. One non-food con is the parking...I have yet to find an \"easy\" way to get to Futo Buta if you drive there. Taking light rail would put you right at the front door.",

Futo Buta does not use any of the convenient apps like NoWait or OpenTable, so you have to actually go there physically to get your name in. They have their own texting system so you could walk away, but it's definitely not the most convenient.   We arrived around 6pm on a Sunday evening and saw there was only one table outside with patrons. It was a nice evening, so when we checked in, we said we preferred outside. We then watched at the host seated a whole bunch of other people outside, filling every table. After waiting about 30 minutes (after being told it should only be 20), we asked what happened... and they had put us on the outside-only list. So now that there were no tables, we were \"next in line\" but waiting for all of these people to finish their meals who had literally just started. Meanwhile all these other people showed up and got seated indoors while we sat and waited for just one outdoor table. Do I understand why the host interpreted our request to sit outside as outside-only? Yeah. Do I understand why he told us 20 minutes and then proceeded to fill every single outdoor table with others? No.  That being said, the food is awesome! The cold ramen is strange, but other than that, everything is good. I highly recommend the Fire and Ice. They had run out of the salmon the night we were there, but allowed me to sub in another protein, which they normally don't allow. I subbed in tofu. It was ok.. kinda dry... but still amazing broth and veggies in there.",

Ofcourse everyone knows the food is great here, the menu is unique, and tons of cool dishes and flavors, etc. But I want to emphasize the experience and atmosphere. Reminds of a New York City sorta spot--only because it is small but super cozy and adds to the allure of the place.  And it has to have people who move swiftly and know what is what!  They do. I know there are other employees who are on point but my last experience was with Rylina (bartender), Jon and Stephanie.  Everyone partners together and it is noticeable.  Really nice to see and very refreshing!  Well done!  It is what makes people come back...",

So my brother and I went there and he ordered the spiciest ramen while I ordered the cold ramen which was the seasonal special. I asked to make my ramen spicier since I love spicy stuff and i was not disappointed. My brothers ramen was a traditional hot ramen with several different meats all  the spicy ones they have. Mine did not have a broth really. It was a small amount of juice and i slurped that all away even though it was really spicy. I loved the pork belly it was juicy and tender.  The flavors were exceptional and were a total mouth full explosion.  Honestly I'm just looking for my next excuse to go back there. The service was great we sat at the bar and the young lady was super helpful and made a mean Tokyo mule",

Something weird, but the chairs didn't have backs to them, I like to it back, I felt like I was hunching over at times. Anyways, the food was great, it was hot and very plenty, one soup bowl you can probably share with someone and get an appetizer. The server (she was at the bar, I forget her name) was amazinggggg and on point.  everything I asked for she got it and was on top of it. She was sweet and personable as well. The broth was on the oily side, but I loved it. I can't wait to come back. THANK you!",

    "text": "Without noodles, we'd have darkness and no carbs...oh and did I mention DARKNESS?!  Futo Buta makes HOMEMADE ramen noodles. I mean, can someone just send me noods so I can be in the comfort of my home already? Ubereats, I am looking at you.   My fiance and I came here for a date night because Ramen is the perfect way to enjoy a romantic rainy day. After reading reviews and putting my Yelpyness to work, I noted the lack of reservations and the size of the establishment, but that didn't stop us.   Arriving at 4pm on a Saturday, I thought would put us in the power position. WRONG. We got in line and put our names on the list and 30 minutes later we were seated at the communal table in between another couple who was on a date night and a group of three who had the most interesting conversations. (definitely, a girlfriend meeting her new boyfriend's best friend for the first time.)  Upon sitting down, we hardly looked at the menu because we are pros and looked ahead of time. With fired sticky rice, Fire and Ice with an egg and the traditional Miso ramen ordered we were off to the races. Our waitress didn't miss a beat and was super helpful the few times we had questions. With the size of this restaurant, I was excepting to feel on top of the people next to us, but I didn't.   The moment of truth... When our food arrived, I am positive that David leaned over and whipped the drool off my face. I've been seen a more beautiful display of ramen in my life. What are we waiting for -- let's dig in!   Fire and Ice was a huge hit. You can tell the noods are hand rolled and have that extra bit of love in them. Adding an egg is a pro tip. Do it, you can thank me later.  Fried Sticky Rice nom nom nom. When this plate came out, the couple next to us asked what we ordered and told us they were experiencing food envy. After taking a bite, damn right they were because those rice squares are something to talk about.   I can't wait to go back to Futo Buta! If you haven't been yet, make it a point to come here. Expect to wait, but it's worth it!",

Also, the workers were out there pretty fast with the heater. I've been looking for a good ramen place and this place is by far the best one in Charlotte. Broth was deliciously flavorful. The noodles had a nice bite to them. Definitely a place to try if you like ramen. They have other items besides ramen but that's what we were there for.",

Tucked behind a shopping strip, you'll need to park along the street or in nearby parking garages. If you add cold weather with possible rain, be ready to wait more. They actually have a texting system so you don't have to wait there, so that's pretty convenient.  If you do wait it out, their food is pretty great. I only ordered their tonkotsu ramen since I didn't want to stay in there too long. Maybe having lunch late and it being cold influenced my appetite, but I ate the whole bowl. The noodles were fresh and had an almost al dente texture. The broth was rich and balanced, not too fatty or salty, which is key. Lastly, I'll note that the smoked pork belly had a great crunchy 'bark' when biting into it. I didn't expect that, but if you love a change in textures, this is a fantastic surprise.

This place is the shiz, and it's delicious.  Perhaps not the best first date location, but the perfect place to go with friends or someone you've already locked down :).    There are a lot of things I love about this place - but the first and most important is the food.  It's really more like edible art, complete with hands on activities.  If it's your first time you really should try one of the ramen bowls + pork (if you're not a veggie you should just add pork to whatever they have available).  After your first time you can branch out, but why not try what they're known for?  If you're looking for an appetizer I would absolutely try the rice crispy tuna or the steamed bun (pork or eggplant - both bangin).  I have not yet had the pleasure of trying the sushi, but mostly it's because the ramen is just SO good.  Next, the environment.  Imagine the inside of a renovated airstream trailer, decorated by the finest interior designer in the land, that looks and feels like coming in from a long day on the ski slopes to a fireside hearty meal that melts in your mouth.  The staff - every single person in there is remarkably nice.  I've eaten there twice now and both times our waiter/waitress was accommodating and made great recommendations.  The kitchen has a slightly open feel to it, so you can see the chefs and they can see you.  They look up and greet you as you come and go - and in general is just has a really calm, positive energy to it.  That might actually be the best part.   Cheers",

In my opinion, eating out is about enjoying foods you can't duplicate at home and this took the trophy. From the super flavorful miso tofu skewers, to the roasted eggplant buns (amazing!), to the vegan ramen, I can't decide which was my favorite. We aren't big sake drinkers but our waitress/bartender made some recommendations and let us try a few samples and they were great. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

Without trying to sound elitist, coming from Los Angeles which has some of the best restaurants in the world, we've struggled to find anywhere we raved about. Either the food is average or inconsistent. Sometimes the food is decent but the service is off. After many strikeouts we finally found Futo Buta!!   Each time we're greeted quickly. If there's a wait, it's usually quick. The food is always fresh and consistent. The owner/GM Michael recognizes us and checks in to make sure we're good. He's genuine and a good guy, not like a TGIF Manager making his rounds because he has to. Michael actually cares. The music is great too. You can follow them on Spotify if you want to keep listening to their playlist.   Order: Hamachi, Salmon Belly Sushi, Rice Crispy Squares and any of the Ramen. You can't go wrong!   They have a great Saki and beer too!",

To start we had the pork belly bao. The flavors we're very good but I have this \"thing\" about stinginess in my food. Especially when I'm paying a pretty penny for it. The buns each had 1 thin sliver of overcooked pork belly. Yes, it was chewy like shredded beef.  Why?  At $10 I expect a decent slice of pork belly. I'm not asking for a monster chunk. But more than a sliver, please.  I was left wanting.... On to the ramen. I had the Fire and Ice. Salmon was tasty. Well cooked. Broth was good. Flavorful enough. I added spicy sauce. Raw veggies were scarce. More like decoration. Noodles were, well, noodles. They were good. Well cooked. But nothing to write home about. Hubby had the Shoyu bowl. His was slightly heartier.  The portions were not very large in comparison to, for example, local pho restaurants. The prices were, once again, hefty for the portions.   I just don't know. I wasn't wowed by Futo. And I'm so sad I wasn't. I'm not sure why everyone is talking up this place so much.",

I would say the Brussel's sprouts and the crispy tuna squares are a must order. I wasn't impressed with the eggplant buns and wouldn't order again, but folks say the pork ones are tasty.   I've sampled a variety of ramen bowls and each time they have been good. But I keep going back for the vegan bowl (I add an egg). The broth is flavorful and there are a good variety of veggies and toppings.   It's kind of hard to find, your GPS will probably get confused. Just turn by the Crispy Crepe off South Blvd and it will dead end into a parking garage.   The interior is very small, so you usually have to wait, but I think it's worth it!",

More than likely your phone will be useless as they share the building with other tenants and have been trying to get a separate address to help people find it quicker. Street parking is free on the weekends, lots of parking available. Now onto the food, the Rice Krispy Squares are very crispy and great to pile on the raw tuna. The ramen we tried had pecan smoked pork belly with pickled ginger and assorted mushrooms with large egg to add creaminess to the dish. Everything we had was great including the servers and waitress that helped explain some of the menu items and customizing the certain dishes to our needs. So don't stress out about finding this gem it took us out of owners maybe five minutes to get there. Great spot !",

The bowls are works of art. And the combination of flavors--words cannot describe how good the food was. The buns were amazing. Best of all, your meal can be topped off with housemade soft serve ice cream.   The only tiny downside is that I feel the \"ramen\" is more akin to soba. It's definitely got some buckwheat content to it. Still chewy and delicious, but definitely not your classic yellow ramen.  If I could sneak away from work every day, I would!",

We ordered the Rice Crispy Squares (interesting, but not sure I would order it again) as our appetizer.  I had the Fire & Ice ramen ($13) as my entree.  The presentation was beautiful, and overall the flavors were very good, except some bites were a bit salty; I'm not sure whether it was just a one-off occurrence or whether their flavor profile is on the saltier side.  My fiance had the Tonkotsu ramen ($14), which was also very good flavor-wise, but still slightly on the salty side for our tastes.  The portion sizes for the ramen were OK -- not a lot for the price, but enough to fill you for lunch.  The service was great, but expect to wait during peak lunch and dinner hours.  Waiting outside isn't too bad, though, if the weather is nice.  We waited about 30 mins on a Saturday around lunchtime, but just walked around the light rail tracks to kill time.  Will be back!",

It's an excellent Izakaya--you can enjoy a full on meal or you could have some sake from their choice list or beer (local craft, Japanese) and share smaller plates.  The fried brussel sprouts are quite popular with good reason.  Also, the Rice Crispy squares, chewy with spicy tuna, are out of this world.  If I am there, it's full on meal for me and bring on the ramen! My favorite is the Tonkotsu Ramen--though they are all quite tasty!  Be sure to add (2$) spicy ground pork.  I always have to take a picture of my bowl--very beautifully prepared.  Throw in a Chirashi Roll from the fresh sheet and you'll achieve gustatory Nirvana.    Just to add a lil something about the space itself.  Inside, the decor is genius in its simplicity but incorporates a more Japanese sense of space we'll say. The outdoor seating is nice bc you're on the light rail line.   Its perfect for people watching and scenic as uptown is in view.  On cooler nights, they fire up the heaters for a brisk but cozy al fresco experience.",

We wanted something good to eat before we got out our flight home so we yelped and found this place. My mom really enjoyed hers and I enjoyed hers more than mine as well, she got the fire & ice and I got the tonkatsu. The best thing we had there was probably the fried Brussels sprouts. It was simple but so tasty. I would go back there just for that. We wanted to try the ice cream because it looked amazing but the portions of the ramen were big. Our waitress, Stephanie, she was very nice and attentive as well.",

I'm sure everything that I would have said about this place has been said so I'll spare the details.  My dish was good and I was impressed by the large bowl filled with deliciousness.  Service was great as well...the only thing is that when it gets busy, you're kinda rushed towards the end of your meal to pay and get up from the table.  I wasn't alarmed by this because I did see that on their website.  Just made me giggle when I saw that it was True.  Someone picked up our empty bowls and I went in for a sip of my full glass of wine and all of a sudden the check came.  Wait..whaaaaa....t...I wanted to order another glass of....ok I guess I'll just drink this one and be done.  LOL! No biggie.  Can't wait to go back with the hubster...he would love it!",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to check out Futo Buta. For the most part, I felt underwhelmed. The food was just okay, which, when combined with the price, was a bummer.   I got the miso (hungry) and it was not bad, just not worth $12. I also ordered the duck confit buns which were also good, just not worth $10. I topped the meal off with ice cream and it was tasty,  just not worth $5. Are you seeing a theme here? Overpriced for what you get, in my opinion.   The highlight to the experience was the service. Everyone was super friendly, and our waitress was top-notch. She talked to me about their sake selection, and explained how sake works (for lack of a better word). She was extremely nice, and checked in often.  Ultimately, I feel neutral toward this place. I can't exactly recommend it, but also wouldn't NOT recommend it, if that makes sense. I think if you're willing to spend the money, you could do much better if you're not set on ramen; but then again, ramen is a unique dish and I don't know of any other ramen places in CLT. So... Give it a try. Or don't. Whatever.   And thus ends the most useless Yelp review ever!",

The dinning room is small but cozy and even though it was a Sunday night we had to wait a bit to be seated, though it didn't take long. We got the pork buns to start and holy smokes would I recommend these! It's just two buns but it's a great starter for two people. They were a little spicy but over all super well balanced and delicious.  We both ordered our own ramen, he got fire and ice and I can't remember the name of the one I got but it was the first one on that section of the menu. The fire and ice was AMAZING ! I stole so many tastes of it I thought my boyfriend was gonna kill me ha! It's a kimchi broth and it has salmon in it. And my goodness was this salmon amazing. It would pretty much melt in your mouth. It was fantastic. My bowl was more salty(which I like!), it had mushrooms, pork belly, an egg and a few other things in it. Again it was amazing. They serve these with a few spice side additions and I highly recommend using the chili oil in the bowl I got. It adds just enough spice.   Well finally we got the soft serve ice cream, which changes flavors I'm not sure if it's daily or weekly or monthly but it changes. Today they had a green tea and honey and a strawberry and basil. We got a cup of both and they were fantastic. The cups were paper so we were lucky enough to walk out with them and finish our ice cream on the walk to the car.   This place is worth the wait if there is one and always get the ice cream, you won't regret it! We love it here. And will be back very soon!",

They don't take reservations or do the app. So you have to wing it! We went early like before 6 and got right in. It's a small spot. We sat at the bar, had a cool waitress who explained everything and what was popular. We tried 2 of their most popular items. 1 the fried tuna squares, amazing. 2 the slider bbq rolls (not called that but you'll know what they are by the menu) so good!! 3 fire & ice ramen bowl (we shared) very good but a little too spicy for me. I don't do spicy but my guy does so I tried it anyways. We also got like a fifty dollar bottle of saki. Yeah we went hard that night. Also they have soft serve ice cream! Usually 2 flavors but so unique. I had a matcha green tea with honey drizzle on top. Basically why I came here bc I saw a pic of this green ice cream on yelp I believe. Sold! Get some! They also had strawberry basil as their other flavor but apparently they change them out every so often. - It was booming shortly after we got our apps and was busy! We came at the perfect time. We had good service and really enjoyed everything we tried!! (Hence the return)   2nd time, I called like 7:15 to see how long the wait was and she said 40 mins. We were in route and when we got there & checked in (they sign you in on iPad and text you when your table is ready) she said 20-25 mins (3 of us). So we were like sweet even better! But then 35 mins go by and another couple who had got there literally 10 mins ago (I heard her tell them 30 min wait) they get seated so I'm like wtf is going on. So i check with her, and she's like there's two spots that should be done anytime now and then we will seat you. So it's a guessing game that they ain't good at. We waiting another 15 before we got our table. Luckily we all knew what we wanted and ordered right away. But we then were pushed for time. And the whole experience just wasn't as cool. I had the misu ramen. It was good! Just wish we were sat when we were told we would be. And wish they do reservations or at least the no wait app!! Hence my 4 stars and not 5.",

Super crispy, moist and flavorful. Squeeze the lime in top. The sauce that it comes with is delicious, but a little spicy. It's not necessary, but brings the chicken to another level.   Tonkatsu Ramen - 3/5. I wanted to like it. It was fine though. The noodles were good-great thickness and chewy. Egg was perfectly cooked. The char sui was a little different, where it's seared. The broth, which is the foundation for any ramen, was lacking. It was one note and didn't have really any flavor. I added the hot sauce and it still do anything for me. If the broth was better then the stars would be higher. Tonkatsu Ramen is all about deep, milky, flavorful broth.",

    "text": "If you have been looking for a fancy-ish ramen place (similar to those amazing bowls seen in Chef's Table or any trendy food Instagram) this is THE place for you. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the Charlotte/South End area. I've been here quite a few times for both in-house and take-out and each has been great, although for take-out you do not get as much broth, but it is still worth it.   For appetizers, I would definitely recommend the Japenese fried chicken (in picture below). It is magically both insanely crispy on the outside without drying out the inside. The chicken is savory and incredibly juicy. It also comes with a semi-spicy ginger dressing that adds such a complex flavor to the dish. I have also gotten the fried red miso tofu skewers and I would recommend that as well!  For the main course, I am really surprised this bowl has not received more hype on Yelp. The Shoyu Ramen Bowl is my all time favorite (see in the picture below)!!! It is a chicken/dashi broth will amazing ingredients on top including bamboo, scallion, this magical tasting egg, wakame, onion AND MOST IMPORTANTLY their famous pecan smoked pork belly. You need to make sure that you try and/or add the pork belly on top of your ramen bowl when you go here, because you need to go here. My boyfriend always gets the Tonkotsu Ramen and is NEVER disappointed. Our friend recently got the Miso Ramen Bowl and he was by far mesmerized.   Considering they have so many great ramen bowls, I really wish they either did some sort of small pick two option or maybe had a \"Ramen flight\" where you could get samples of a few bowls to try. I would definitely love to try more of the options that they offer, however, I always end up getting the Shoyu Bowl because I can't go there and not get it. It is that addicting.   The only con for this place is that it is VERY small. I am by far surprised that they have not expanded to a bigger place yet as they could clearly fill it up. I would recommend for your first time either going on off hours or going on a nice day when you can sit outside.  I would highly recommend this place, as you will NOT be disapointed.",

We've been watching a lot of Naruto lately so it felt good to get some proper ramen in us.   We went on a crowded Saturday night but only had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes for seating. We sat outside as gentrifiers walked their dogs, biked and jogged along the sidewalk. We talked Naruto as we sipped the delicious cocktails. By the time we got our ramen we were discussing Kabito in comparison to Garra.   At any rate it was good and you should definitely go here if you love delicious ramen. I've never really had ramen this good. It felt authentic.   The staff was great, the atmosphere was nice and the food was worth dealing with a slight crowd.  You should also watch Naruto if you haven't already. It's streaming on Netflix right now so there's no excuse.   Also, black lives matter.",

My friend and I decided to dine outside on the patio--Small and charming space. The weather was perfection! A comfortable seventy-degree temperature! I looked over the menu before coming. Of course, Ramen is the signature item. I've heard nothing but great things about this establishment.   The Appetizer: My friend suggested the Rice Crispy Squares. I'm OBSESSED with spicy tuna so this was perfect! The spicy tuna comes in a small mason jar, paired with crispy fried rice and soy sauce. Simple and delicious--Your taste buds will thank you.   Our Entree's: Decisions, decisions!! I couldn't decide between the Tonkotsu and the Fire & Ice. Both are very popular--You can't go wrong with either. I choose the Fire & Ice Ramen. Seriously, I could've disappeared into this bow! My favorite part was the hot smoked salmon! It literally melted between my chopsticks! I can't wait to come back! Bottomline this has become by favorite Ramen spot in Charlotte!!",

I usually get the Tori Kara age, spicy tuna donburi, Blue fin taro tartare, Buta bowl, and the soft serve for dessert. The Chicken tori Kara age is well cooked and seasoned. They are crispy and tasty even without the mayo dipping. I love the thin and delicate taro chip topped with the blue fin tartare. The Buta ramen is perfectly cooked and the broth is deeply flavored. Mostly, one can only find the soft serve ice cream Japanese style here. I love all their seasonal flavor of soft serve",

She was extremely friendly and her welcoming and bubbly personality started a refreshing experience that I recommend for all who are thinking about visiting. I ordered the Shishito pepper appetizer and I immediately fell in love with all of the flavors that were combined in this dish. Imagine roasted peppers with the seeds in garlic and a soy sauce with a flavor that complimented each very well. How could you lose. Then to order the main dish of the Chizu ramen that was amazing.  I don't eat anything with flower, which can present a severe issue at some restaurants, however I was able to substitute rice instead of noodles and am happy I did. My food was seasoned very well and I will definitely be back again, especially for the peppers.",

Seriously amazing food, amazing service and affordable but for delectable food unlike anything you can get elsewhere in CLT. Also it's usually packed so you may way a little bit unless you come at the right time but it's so worth it.  I could've easily skipped the apps since the ramen is huge but I had to try the rice crispy squares. They are so unique and so delicious. You need to try these things at least once in your life.  My friend and I both got the Tonkotsu. Let me just say...amazing. Those of you that equate ramen to the 25 cent  noodles you can score at any grocery or big box store, think again. This is some real ramen, which means more than just some seasoned broth and noodles. The broth itself is amazing. The onsen egg was killer and the pork belly brought in a ridiculously rich flavor to tie it all together. We both left with about half of a ramen to eat for lunch the next day aka midnight snack. Just try not to eat all the pork belly before leaving if you want some with your second half.  Great local beers on tap and excellent service. Casual laid back vibe and can get kinda loud but it's south end that's the way it should be.",

We started off with the Tori Kara Age (Japanese friend chicken) which came with a chili mayo dip. While the flavor was on point, the fried chicken wasn't as crunchy as I anticipated which I'd argue was due to taking it in a to-go container. I'd be interested to try it again at the restaurant. Onto the ramen--ah the delicious ramen. I got the Tonkotsu and added bok choy. It was INCREDIBLE. The bone broth was outstanding--super rich and earthy. And the smoked pork belly makes my mouth water just thinking about it. My boyfriend got the Hiyashi and loved it, although it was more of a noodle bowl and had less broth than mine. I will absolutely be trying Futo Buta again, hopefully sit-down next time!",

There was a blown speaker playing loud music towards the back of the room. It was distracting, so I'm giving four stars.   Food: I got the fire and ice bowl and was amazed that my salmon was prepared medium rare! I was nervous ordering it at first, for fear of having to force over cooked salmon down my gullet. I was pleasantly surprised. Delicious. Fresh. But if you're wanting something spicy, either add it yourself or order something else entirely.   The pork bun was not undercooked. In fact, it was fluffy and very supporting of the pork belly, delicately nestled between hoisin sauce and sliced greens. Yum.  Crispy rice was good. Just be careful. That soy sauce they bring to the table with wasabi already in it can take you by surprise. Spicy but good!   Waitstaff: Our waitress was attentive and friendly. When our friend wanted a bit more kick to his bowl of noodles, she brought out three different kinds of spicy condiments for him. Having just moved here from Pittsburg, I would say she's doing one Hell of a job!",

We had only just been served and most of us were almost done eating. He stated that seating was limited because it was a small restaurant and others were waiting. We had not been there for even an hour. I do not see how that was our problem. I have been here many times before and not had an issue. I will NEVER go back and tell others how poorly we were treated. It is quite unfortunate that the manager was completely unprofessional. He also stated that we are welcome to come back if we were all eating. Again completely unprofessional.",

I usually sick with either the brussels sprouts dressed in a soy and teriyaki sauce or rice squares with ahi tuna to start. If you're not a fan of sprouts.. you'll be in love after you try their's! As for the ramen, I've tried the miso with pork and the vegan with tofu. Both pack so much flavor into a huge bowl of homemade noodles! You even have the option to add spicey pork (which is SPICEY) or add in your own spice with the sauces they bring to the table. They change the ice cream flavors daily but they've always been on point! Definitely need to try one when you go! The place can get pricey but the location is beautiful on the lite rail line with a great view of Uptown and AMAZING food!",

Worth the wait.  All spring I had been staring at the \"Ramen is coming May 2015\" sign on the door since I take the Lynx to work every morning.  Most of my instagram friends witnessed me taking photos of the progress of the patio outside... table and chairs being set out... the sign being placed atop the entrance.  Glad I went last night when things were not as crazy, but I'm sure they are going to get slammed this weekend.  Sat at the bar and took in the space.  The dining room has a modern feel - metal bar stools, but warm wood surfaces to balance everything.  The patio outside has some nice lighting and three big umbrellas to provide some shade.  Probably the best part about sitting at the bar is that you have a front row of all the action in the kitchen since there is a large hole in the wall where the orders are placed on the window and allows you to see just how hard the chefs and sous chefs are busting their butts to give you some tasty food.  I had the Miso (Hungry):  Sweet white corn, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, bean sprout, cabbage, onsen egg, sesame with house made chili sauce (a must).  So delicious.  the pork belly was super good, and I had a fun time fishing out the corn (which you could tell were fresh from the cob by the way the rows stuck together).  The chili sauce takes it up a notch if you like spicy.  Will be interesting to see their full array of ramen and rolls once they \"fully\" open but judging by their limited menu now, I will probably be in here a lot.  Sitting at the bar, it was cool to talk to Adam and finding out more about how they got this place together.  It really has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  Nothing stuffy or pretentious... just casual... darn good ramen.  I loved how people would walk in from the South End neighborhood and see each other at the bar... great atmosphere.",

Their tonkotsu ramen had no flavor other than saltiness. The noodles had a wired texture. It's definitely the worst ramen I have ever tasted. However I'm giving them 2 stars because they were using really good quality ingredients. The purpose was good. The result was not. The fried chicken was ok. I'm attaching a picture of ramen I made by myself to prove my expertise and the honesty of my comment.",

Stopped in yesterday and ordered the smoked pork belly buns and Tonkotsu ramen. First, the pork belly rolls didn't have a spongy light texture, they were closer to a biscuit texture than a roll. The pork itself was nothing to write home about - most of the fat was rendered off causing it to be quite dry. The ramen is only as good as the broth that comprises its base. Futo's didn't have that silky unctuous flavor of a protein meat base, more like bone soup. The ramen noodles and mushrooms were the bright spots. David Chang - Charlotte needs you !",

It seemed to be a long wait but since I just needed a table for one there was a spot at the bar opened and I got seated right away. Everyone else that I seen waiting was seated pretty quickly as well. It's very small yet cozy inside and they have seating outside with an awesome view of the city. I started by ordering the Tokyo Mule, that I would totally recommend to any Moscow Mule lover. Then the couple next to me asked was it my first time here and suggested I order the Rice crispy squares and my other neighbor suggested the Brussels sprouts. I went with the rice crispy squares tonight (Brussel sprouts next visit) because you can't go wrong with fried sticky rice and spicy tuna and I was right because it was awesome! But it's definitely not an app for one if you plan on eating ramen after because I was pretty full but I came for ramen so I got ramen. I choose the Fire & Ice since I love smoked salmon and it was sooo good. I have no complaints about this place the food was great, the service was great, the people around me were great.. it was a perfect date night for myself!",

At night or weekend, definitely be prepared to wait. The new location is right off the rail line, so it's easy to get to. Parking isn't available, but you can park somewhere in southend and walk to it.The miso ramen was absolutely delicious. The rice crispy squares appetizer is a MUST order. It is presented perfectly, but is a light and airy dish with the ahi tuna that you place on top of it.  Futu Buta means \"the fat pig\" so i recommend trying a pork dish! The low country smoked pork belly is to die for. The service was great, the food was delicious, and we left with full stomachs. The service was a little slow because of how packed it always is, but if you're enjoying company, what is their to complain about?",

    "text": "First... this place is IMPOSSIBLE to find. Get out your Google maps! It is nowhere NEAR Bland Street (it's mailing address). It is across the light rail tracks from the Bland Station and the Trolley Powerhouse Museum.  OK. Now that you've found it... be prepared to get up close and personal with the other diners. This place is pretty small and only has a few tables. You can eat at the bar or at a little counter they have built against the window. Also, it is SUPER loud. Don't come here on a first date if you want to get to know each other!  The food: Our group had the tonkotsu ramen and the miso ramen. The miso was more authentic. The tonkotsu was a little too greasy and not salty enough (we lived in Japan for over 11 years and have tasted LOTS of ramen... trust me). If you're not a purist, both are probably excellent. Also, for my taste, the noodles could have been cooked a little bit more, but that could be personal preference.  The pork belly buns... AMAZING! Also, they come 2 to a plate, but since we had 3 in our group, they were willing to do 1.5 orders so we could get 3 buns. That's customer service!  Speaking of customer service, the food comes out FAST! We were hungry when we got there, so that was a good thing!  One thing that IS authentic is the tiny water glasses--straight up Japanese style there! They refill often and leave a bottle nearby, so no problem... just a funny observation.  Looks like they have a soft serve flavor of the day. When we were there it was yuzu mango. SOOOO good. And a nice palate cleanser after all the greasy food (pork belly is NOT low fat)!  By the time we left, there was a long line of people waiting to get in, so even though they are hard to find, they are making a name for themselves. Would I go back? Heck yeah. There are about 10 other things on the menu that I want to try. Will I bring my Japanese husband with me (he wasn't with us on this visit)? Heck no! I don't want to hear all his comments about this isn't authentic and that isn't authentic, blah, blah, blah. This little place will remain MY secret (hope he's not reading my Yelp reviews)!",

I knew there were tons of pho places around but then I Yelped \"Ramen\" to try my luck... and sure enough, a ramen place! I already told myself not to have high hopes because I still haven't found good ramen in North Carolina. Pressure is on though ....I dragged 4 of my friends with me (even though they wanted to get brunch food and they were like \"Janet, of course you always want Asian food\") but they were nice enough to let me drag them haha.... but lucky for me, they all thought the food was amazing! Phew!  5 stars for the beautiful presentation of each dishes, the decor and the friendly staff. One of the nice servers there even walked out to the street to give us step by step directions while we were lost. SO NICE!!!    Here's what we ordered: 3 stars for their Tonkatsu Ramen - ok but still better than Dashi in Durham so I'll take it. The broth was tasty but the noodles were so-so. I guess I'm always going to be comparing it to the places in LA or Totto or Ippudo in NYC....  :-/  5 stars for the ramen if comparing it to other ramen in NC  5 stars on the following dishes: Salmon belly nigiri special - soo delicious Spicy tuna rice squares- perfectly seasoned, great combo of textures, beautiful presentation Eggplant bun- fresh and delicious - I love eggplant Fire and Ice Ramen - 5 stars for the broth, love the kimchi, gingery taste. Very unique and  full body flavor 2 star for the asparagus as we thought the texture was too slimy  Overall, I would give it \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" ... for ramen in NC so far :)  I will definitely come back again to get my Ramen Fix in NC and ESPECIALLY to try all their appetizers. Definitely think their starters were the stars of the meal!",

The food is so good that, after I leave the restaurant, I feel like the world gets a little more colorful and happier. I am a vegetarian, and I suggest ordering the Niwa ramen ($12) and the red miso tofu skewers ($5) if you are also vegetarian. Also, any of the daily soft serve ice creams are delicious. I highly recommend this place to anybody who likes authentic ramen, because I've tried every other ramen place in Charlotte and nothing comes close!",

We took the waitress up on a sake sample but order wine instead.  This time I tried (and we shared) the rice crispy/tuna appetizer, the fire and ice ramen (with salmon) and the pork belly taco.  First, the food -- I loved the Rice Crispy. Was like an amazing hash brown with tuna on top. Made for sharing and truly excellent. It is fried but when you share, calories don't count.   Next the Fire and Ice...  I love Ramen but this broth was a bit too intense for me. The noodles and salmon were excellent but tasted this broth well after dinner.   Pork bell taco w/ steamed taco. Super good.   Waitress and service were great.   I really like this place. It just feels fun, trendy and all around good!",

I really enjoyed this small, but impressive location.  First off, the music selection ROCKS. SO NICE to hear some great rock'n'roll. I get tired of classic oldies, pop, and Muzak all the time.  Secondly, the staff is very cool. Our waitress, Jeanelle, was very hospitable and accommodating and checked on us often, but not too often.  Of course, the food was superb. Nothing like a hot bowl of tonkotsu to warm up with on a chilly November night. Arguably the best I've ever had. As for beverages, the sake menu is impressive, but the Hot Ringo is not to be missed! Sadly, the one aspect of this dining venue that we didn't enjoy was the crowded indoor dining area or the cold outdoor patio. This place has a lot of customers and is in desperate need of expanding in order to comfortably accommodate several dozen customers. Still though, they did provide some pretty warm heat lamps to keep outside patrons cozy.    Overall, a superb dining experience, as long as you don't mind sharing a table with strangers or dining outside. If so, then the food, music, and service are worth a visit.",

Today I decided to stop in to Futo Buta as it is directly behind our offices.  Upon entering I was greeted immediately by the nice and friendly staff.  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  My server, Kyle, helped me through the menu and described various choices.  Ultimately I decided on an order of the Buns (one pork, one duck) and a specialized version of the Raman affectionately known as \"The Bowl Kyle tells everyone to get\".  Basically it's one of the menu bowls with added spicey pork sausage.  The buns were nothing short of delicious.  Remember to move each to the separate plate or the juices will mix.  Not necessarily ruining anything but at least tainting the original taste profile.  As a side note, I visited the rest rooms and the art was very entertaining, you have to check it out for yourself.  The main course was flavorful and very fulfilling.  On Kyle's recommendation I added some of the side dish of sausage into the broth and it began to heat it up.  If I were to order again I'd put about half the sausage in as by the time I was towards the end of the bowl it was VERY spicey.  About my only issue was the price.  For lunch it was quite expensive but I did order 2 dishes.  Perhaps when I go back I would only choose one or the other but they were both so good and I was so satisfied I don't mind spending the money that I did.  I will be back and bring friends.",

The presentation of the ramen was great and clearly showed effort - slices of fatty roast pork, onsen egg, black ear mushrooms, menma, ginger, sesame and scallions.  The soup also had the right color and consistency.  With all the visual elements of the ramen done right, you would expect a strong, almost creamy tonkotsu broth bursting with flavour to complete the picture of the \"pefect\" tonkotsu ramen.  I took a sip of the broth with huge anticipation, but what a let down... the soup lacked flavour/depth and was simply underwhelming.  For the rest of the bowl, the noodles were bland, but the ingredients tasted ok.    I hate to say it as I had really high hopes walking in, but what a huge disappointment.  Ippudo should consider opening a shop here in the Queen City and they will beat every single competition hands down in this desert town for Asian cuisine.",

    "text": "Now, I been trying to hit Futo Buta for a while now. First time I came in the afternoon they had a major rush. The place was so small and crowded that there weren't any seats. There was a wait already so we decided to leave. There is patio seating, but i doubt anyone wants to eat there if it's raining or freezing cold.  Then recently we finally gotten a chance to come in the afternoon and it was crazy busy.. they seated us quickly because there was only a few seats available. We ordered dumplings and they were by far the best dumplings I ever tried! They put jalapeno on the side for us and you can put in your sauce or with your dumpling.. it was delicious!   My friend and I had Tonkotsu ramen bowl. It does feel you up because of the big portion, but flavor wise I think the pork broth wasn't strong enough. The 2/3 peices of pork belly threw me off. Tonkatsu usually has a big chunk of marinated porks. The noodles was alright as well. I thought putting in spicy spices would help but it made it more salty and just more oily. So I wasn't impressed with the ramen.  This is just my preference but the art on the bathrooms are of anime characters.. the colors are really vibrant. The style of the painting has exciting brush strokes, so I don't believe they fit the image of how down to earth Futo Buta is. When I walked into the bathroom I was thinking to myself \"What is going on?\" Pink and purple octopus with anime character who is drawn quite disfigurly and the minimalistic decor of the restaurant just doesn't clash together so well. Now, this is my preference and I know that other people don't have to agree. I'm just one of the few people who enjoy the art is restaurants. I support restaurants who gives artists a chance to showcase their work.   Service wise, our waitress was nice and very patient. She checked on us even when we saw that she was busy. The only thing was that when we got our checks we waiting for her for quite some time to collect it. So we actually had to go up towards the bar and someone had to notify for her that we were waiting to go.   My conclusion: that I wouldn't mind trying other various things off their menu next time. Defiantly will be getting their dumpings! I'm hoping that ramen was just an off day for them, but when it comes to seating.. it has very very limited space. It was crowded and when I had to get out and put on my jacket and purse on I think I was almost hitting the nice stranger next to me. Maybe I'll wait until the spring/summer time and patio is open to try again. Who knows?   Thank you for feeding me!",

They welcomed all of us and sat us immediately and brought out a water bowl for our thirsty pup. We enjoyed looking at all the Lynx riders and everyone passing by. It's a great place to people watch!  The service was great! Every employee was so friendly, attentive, and hard at work. I didn't see anyone standing around or walking around without something in their hand. This is how every dining experience should be.   The food is made from scratch, in house. Terrific! I got the Tonkotsu ramen and the hubs got the vegan ramen. Pork add to the depth in flavor in the broth. Ask for the Japanese 7 spice to add a kick to the meal. Slurp away! And for dessert, YES.   Now we don't just have to watch the travel or food channel for a ramen bowl...we can get one in our own Queen City!",

I won't even say what we got, but they were both delish and filling and nice for a cloudy, early fall lunch date.  Great outdoor patio and plenty of bar seating and low tables.  I love the staff shirts (which you can buy).  Great selection of music playing.  Seems like it would have a nice evening crowd, too.

It is always crowded so I assume that the food must be really good. One day I saw they were serving soft serve and I asked if that was an all the time thing and they said yes! So I had some free time I stopped in for the soft serve. It's fall so of course there are seasonal flavors. They had pumpkin and another flavor that was something like a caramel apple. I am just indecisive with life so I opted to have both mixed! My eyes were so huge when I saw it coming my way lol. It did not disappoint. You could taste each flavor but it wasn't too overbearing. I'm a lover of both flavors so I wouldn't of minded if it was anyway lol. I finished it faster than I would like to admit and I'll always want to try the soft serve now.   Now as for the ramen I still have to go back and try it so I'll post about that when I do but yes Great eats!",

My wife and I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen bowl and Japanese fried chicken.

One thing to note is that parking here is not as complicated as it may seem, but the GPS will confuse you if you're not familiar with the area. The atmosphere was fun. We went for a late lunch, around 2P, so we missed the big rush. The service was great and the portions were huge.   My friend had the Chizu bowl which she did not enjoy, it was too cheesy and salty for her tasty. I sampled and wasn't a fan either.  I had the Buta Bowl and really enjoyed it. I got the spicy items on the side so I could manage the spice myself and ended up putting most of the spice in the bowl, not too spicy and full of flavor. I have plenty   left over for lunch the next day.   The stars of the meal for me where the appetizers. We shared the Tori Kara Age (Japanese Fried Chicken), the sauce that comes with it was  delicious. My absolute favorite thing I ate were the Brussel Sprouts! I have never had a sprout flavored quite like these, they were AMAZING and I will order them every time I'm at this place. And yes, they move!",

He was also super friendly and checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed. The rice crispy squares where delicious. Perfectly crisped to perfection. I had read on yelp that the fried chicken was more batter than chicken, but in my opinion it was coated lightly and super flavorful. The pork belly buns were really good too. They definitely know how to cook pork belly really well. The ramen bowl is really filling so we split it and it was the best decision.  The broth was super flavorful and it makes a huge difference when the base of the dish is well done. All the ingredients were so good I can't wait to come back!!",

    "text": "This is a hole in the proverbial and literal wall that you will NOT want to miss.  After a small yelp search during the \"what's for dinner\" games, I stumbled on Futo Buta.  The reviews were great and by people I know and trust.  So, we decided to give it a try.  We were met at the door by a young guy using an app to seat people.  It all happened so quickly, I'm wondering if they can make the same app available for other businesses.  The actual seating are is extremely small. There is also a bar area which is similarly small.  A large outside seating area, but a few drawbacks.  It's rights by the train stop (can be loud and full of interesting characters who don't care that you are eating a meal). It is also, or at least it wasn't when we were there, covered so it can rain and ruin your meal as it did for the groups eating outside while we ate inside.    The food... I had the Niwa which was a vegan ramen and the Futo Buta Fusion cocktail.  Oh my!  Sooooo good!!!!  The cocktail had citrus peel in it as well as a fresh sprig of rosemary.  It was mouthwatering good.  The ramen was served in a massive bowl and had arugula in it.  What a fantastic touch!  We ate until we couldn't eat anymore.   The staff were all very accommodating and attentive and also not bad to look at!!  Our waiter was working the bar area and he did a great job. The music was a bit to be desired. They blasted a punk rock style of music loudly which I personally do not like.  But, I was there for the food not the music.    I cannot wait to go back and have another go at the menu.  I've already reached out to friends and coordinated our next adventure to Futo Buta.  Great job guys and gals!",

    "text": "When I saw the reviews on this place, I was super excited to try it! My fiance and I made a plan to go and we weren't disappointed!  The place was packed when we went in, and with the communal tables and loud music, we were a bit overwhelmed and opted to sit outside. It was a short wait and we took a stroll to a small seating area across the tracks. About 10 minutes later we were summoned via text that our table was ready. There was a small wait for our server to come, but considering how busy they were we didn't mind. We were given water and condiments/utensils and asked if we had any questions. The server was super knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly.  We ordered the red miso tofu skewers, tonkatsu ramen and shoyu ramen. The skewers were brought promptly and were very tasty. The tofu had a nice, crispy outside and the sauce was unique and delicious. The ramen arrived just after we finished our appetizer. The broth was complex though not overwhelmingly so and the toppings blended well together. The egg, though not a soy sauce egg like most ramen places I had, was cooked perfectly and was pretty large for the bowl size.  We got full pretty quickly and took the rest home. Our server actually poured it in the bowls for us, which I thought was a nice gesture.  All in all, a very pleasant experience and we will be back.",

    "text": "Totally fine but nothing special at all. Actually pretty great considering how terrible most food is in Charlotte.   The bad: the ramen -- got the special summer ramen and the tonkatsu -- both were totally pedestrian but nothing offensive. Both featured their 'pecan smoked pork belly' which was either inedibly fatty or inedibly chewy. The tonkatsu broth definitely didn't have the depth that long-simmered bone broth has and the broth and the cold ramen was super salty. Also the 'ansen egg' which alleged to be a flash-boiled runny egg was broken in both our bowls which just led to pretty nasty boiled egg bits. All in all the ramen wasn't anything I would ever eat again (unless I lived in a good food oasis like Charlotte which has no other ramen).   The OK: pork buns -- they really don't seem to be able to handle pork belly -- all the meat was either fatty or chewy with no medium. That said the other accoutrements were tasty and it was a good bun.   The good: the beet salad, the toro tartare, the drinks and the service. The roasted beet and date salad was great, the toro tuna tartare with taro chips were fantastic (if a bit shoyu heavy) and the Tokyo Mules were great. Also the service is fantastic.   Overall I would probably return and enjoy their raw food and small plates whilst steering way the hell away from their ramen.",

There is so many bowls to choose from, and lots of yummy other options! I do love their starter menu, such good apps! I love how big the servings are, they make for a great left over day the following day!   They have a good drinks menu, lots of choices. All craft beer. I can't rave enough about this place, and giving it a try! I have been back many times since someone introduced it to me. Yummy Ramen!!!",

    "text": "Have heard nothing but rave reviews from everyone here, the ratings are solid, the previous reviews are solid. So my wife and I decided to take a quick lunch break to see what all the fuss was about. Small location and a little hard to find, but not bad.   The atmosphere is just loud...I don't mind the musical choices but there's no way to really hear anyone without practically shouting.   The service was fine, professional, fast, no complaints here.  We both had the Tonkotsu ramen. I wasn't expecting what I'd get in Japan, or even New York. I did however expect it to be better than some of the other local places. It was hands down the worst Ramen I've had the misfortune of eating. If there's Tare in there, I'm not tasting it, just burnt aromatics and pork fat. I'm a fan of a nice fatty bowl of Mimare style Tonkotsu, this wasn't it. No salty, no smoky, just burnt.  Noodles tasted like the Sun noodles most places use, no complaints there. The egg, just poached with no marinade or other seasoning like most. Pork was decent, good flavor, good fat ratio, it was the star and shouldn't have been.   I'd like to give their other options a shot, but if the lack of flavor in this simple bowl is any indication, I'll take a pass. However for others, give it a shot, could work for you.",

    "text": "Even though I'm new to the Ramen craze, I'd like to consider myself a professional ramen connoisseur. This was my first time trying Futo Buta and it definitely will not be my last!   When it comes to ramen my primary concerns surround spiciness and substance. I like ramen that has multiple ingredients (or at least the option to add/change ingredients) and it needs to have a kick! The Buta Bowl not only met those requirements but instead exceeded all expectations. The Buta Bowl priced at $18, is the largest portion size bowl offered and contains: chicken and dashi broth, double noodle, pecan smoked pork belly, duck confit, spicy pork, ono chili sauce, sweet white corn, leek, scallion, cayenne pepper threads, onsen egg. The spice which can be requested on the side is the perfect combination of heat, sinus clearing and flavor.  The restaurant has a modern/trendy vibe which according to my friends remains busy at all times everyday. The space is small and many tables have you rubbing elbows with neighboring guests. I would not recommend this location for an intimate dinner, unless your comfortable having people listen in on your conversations. but besides the lack of space the place is GREAT!   The restaurant is located in South End area of Charlotte, NC directly touching the light rail across from popular bars Oak room, All american pub and Hot taco. The restaurant has no direct parking but has multiple pay for parking lots nearby and if your lucky some free street side parking.",

The Japanese Fried Chicken was SO delicious (perfectly fried and battered), I had to fight myself not to eat the whole thing (yes, calories!).  The spicy ramen bowl (I think it was the Buta Bowl?) with melt-in-your-mouth pork belly was incredibly good...and indeed hot 'n spicy, even for my Asian taste buds.  The restaurant wasn't visible from the street I was coming from...and it's a very small restaurant, but it made unique use of space with a very cool patio, overlooking the light rail.  Also, service was super-fast and friendly.  Overall, it was top notch in every way...food, presentation, service, even with its quirky ambiance.  Obviously I'm now a fan, and I plan to return...hopefully even drag my husband in (though he's not a ramen lover, he may change his mind?)!",

Getting there - Unless you're walking down the rail trail, you are not going to stumble upon Futo Buta.  The address puts it on Bland Street - this is not accurate for driving purposes.  It's hidden from the main road (South Blvd.) behind Crispy Crepe.  Fortunately, there is a parking garage between Crispy Crepe and Futo Buta - but, you need to know where you're going, because you still won't see the restaurant before pulling in the garage.  It's a bit hard to find, but well worth the effort.   The venue - Futo Buta is small - I can see why there is often a wait to get in here.  (We went at 6ish on Tuesday and had no wait.)   There is a bar that seats maybe 8 - 10 people and then several communal tables and a very few private tables.  Even though you'll be sitting close to others, it has a distinctly romantic/intimate feel.  This is not a kid-friendly venue - it's really ideal for you and one other person.    The menu - YUM!  You have a selection of high-end sushi options, several appetizers and maybe 7 different types of ramen.  We started with the rice crispy square - which was blocks of crispy fried rice and a jar of spicy tuna served with wasabi soy.  Quite tasty.  We then had the Miso (Hungry) and Fire & Ice ramens.  The flavors were rich and warming.  We also had a flight of sake - the bartender was incredibly well-versed on the sake options and could help steer a pro or a novice.  Overall, Futo Buta delivered on every count. I came in with high expectations that were exceeded!",

It's a full house within 10 minutes of opening on the weekends.   Also, if it's your first time know that it's a little hard to spot. Turn in on the little road (Rennsalaer Ave) by Crispy Crepe and park on the ground floor of the parking garage, then walk out towards the light rail, Futo will be to your right side before you get to the rail tracks.

All kinds of stuff that I've never seen elsewhere in Charlotte. The staff does a great job of explaining all of the items and choices. Shout-out to the waitress with dark hair (gluten-free sister) for doing a truly awesome job outlining all of my options since, surprisingly, they use wheat noodles instead of rice.  The chef even came over afterward to make sure that everything was to our liking, which it definitely was. The rice krispies squares are UNBELIEVABLE - I'm going to be craving those for the foreseeable future. My (rice instead of noodle) bowl was delicious and everything tasted really fresh.

It's hard to decide which one was better!  Both dishes came with a pop of fresh sprouts and veggies over perfectly cooked rice or noodles. The flavors were wonderful.  I don't know what kind of mushrooms they used but they were the star of the show!  Make sure to drink lots of water later because they are generous with the salt in all 3 dishes.",

    "text": "Heard good things about this place, so decided to check it out! Very glad I did.  Atmosphere: Came at 10 PM on a Saturday, no line at that time, though the place was actually relatively packed. It's a small shop, very nicely decorated with a dim interior.   Service: Service was great! We sat at the bar, and was asked how we were doing throughout the meal.   Waters were refilled without prompting, and we were asked if we wanted chili sauce also without prompting. Everyone was very friendly.   Food: tonkotsu with sprouts.  - Pros: Solid broth. I had some pretty nice ramen in LA, and this shares the same feel of flavors. Pork is rich and amazing! Fatty and lean parts delicious in their different ways. Noodles were the perfect consistency. Great variety of veggies that give burst of flavor. Presentation is beautiful! - Cons: Medium portion size, though I was full at the end. The onsen egg is almost entirely runny, and I prefer the ajitama.   Overall, if you are a Ramen fanatic and visiting Charlotte, I would recommend trying this place!",

Futo-Buta is hidden along the train line in a very small space which, while clean and expertly decorated, is incredibly hard to fit a party of more than two in.  We were treated as an unwelcome obstacle with a party of 6 and told we could only stand at the bar to wait for a table to open up until people came and wanted to sit there because we couldn't sit outside.  (My friend has Lupus, which I explained, and can't sit outside in sunlight on a 90 degree day)   The ramen was good, but very oily by all accounts of our group.  The restrooms were clean, the table service was prompt once seated, and we would go back, but never with more than two people again.  I will say this was at noon on a summer Saturday in July, so maybe things have changed since then.",

Nearly to the bottom of my bowl and I found the same kind of black hair. I asked for a manager and he said \"that things like this happen\" . As someone who has worked in the service industry for 10 years, I couldn't believe those words were said. Yes, these things happen but twice?! Are they even wearing hair nets in the kitchen? Then he said he was sorry, and offered an ice cream. I turned down the ice cream.  I'm not squeamish but I left there very uncomfortable. I was even more uncomfortable that nothing was done for us other than offering ice cream. Is it unreasonable to think that after finding hair in two dishes, we'd get at least one dish taken care of... Particularly, the bowl that had three bites taken? I won't be back.",

Of course you can't compare to Japan's, however Futobuta's ramen was alright. When I came my broth although deep in flavor, was not salty enough. Also they gave me siracha as a side to add to my ramen, no Chile oil, no sesame oil, or seasoning. For 14 dollars, I definitely did not get my money's worth in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice and it has a hipster-ish feel to the place, but ramen wise, I'll pass.",

Get here before everyone hears, I anticipate lines to get in here in the near future. The Miso Hungry was almost perfection. The noodles were nice and fresh with a chew and the broth had a deep flavor. Egg was just right. I added the pork chili and really recommend it if you like a little spice. Only thing that could have been improved for me is if the pork belly had a little crispness, not sure what the authentic way is though. Everyone was really friendly. Our waitress recommended the strawberry basil soft serve they had on tap that day...it was one of the best ice creams I've had. Can't wait to go back.",

Also, the day we went at lunchtime, with a fairly simple order -- pb buns, miso, and gyoza -- why it took 45 minutes with it not being that crowded was a downer to me.

The cabbage or scallion that was part of the meal was like a huge broccoli stalk end that I navigated around.  I would hope for a little more in the way of corn or the veggies in the ramen.  At a certain point, it felt like a huge bowl of miso soup w/noodles vs. additional items.  The soup was slug slow to come out.  I'm wondering if that is to steep the flavors or some other reason.  Sitting outside & it started to rain.  For the exposed tables on a busy Fri night there wasn't enough room to seat everyone inside.  Luckily, I had completed my meal so I was able to leave vs. stick around for the mania that ensued trying to accommodate the other patrons.  I'll try this again & maybe a different dish vs. ramen.  The buns the table next to me had looked pretty tasty.",

My other half and I traveled the world a bit and have tried a variety of different flavored ramen broth. So I think I would know the profile of tonkotsu ramen. What we expected was a rich pork flavor. What we got was a bowl of noodles sitting in a bland and under seasoned broth. To top it off, there was a layer of oil that congealed if left untouched for a few seconds. It was missing that salty porky flavor that would have been developed have it had been slow cooking for hours before it was served. The shoyu was a little bit better but was lacking that kick that makes you feel warm and fuzzy. For the price we paid, I dont think it was woth $14 a bowl. Very disappointed and underwhelmed. We left our bowls nearly full. Will not be coming back here ever again.",

The pork was flavorful and so tender and juicy that the fat is melting in your mouth while you're eating it. A+ for the bun. I also ordered miso ramen and added spicy pork into it. The taste of miso was very light. My friends had fire and ice ramen and the signature one that I can't remember the name right now. All the broths are flavorful and distinct from each other. Only down side is, I'm not sure if I was full from the appetizer or there was too much ramen. I couldn't finish it. Overall this place is great ! Everyone should come check them out!",

They are definitely an appetizer portion. The strawberry basil ice cream was phenomenal. While the restaurant has a large patio, space inside is definitely limited.",

    "text": "Let me start this review with some honesty; I have never had Ramen before. It has been on my bucket list to try for many years, but just have never been able to convince my restaurant going friends to resist going back to our favorite places. Alas, thus why it has taken so long for me to have this delicious creation.  The location is gorgeous, with string lights surrounding the outdoor patio and and easily accessible light rail stop literally feet away. The inside is spacious and a classy, more modern vibe, so really, you're set either way. I was by myself waiting for a friend, so I took a seat at the bar.  The staff were all friendly and willing to answer questions. The nice bartender walked me through all the nuances of sake and allowed me to sample a few different kinds, before committing to none because I ended up being too full from my ramen. Another day.   Now to the main focus: the ramen. I was between trying many different types for this first experience, but the limited availability of the seasonal option drew me in. I ended up going for it, without much hesitation: butternut squash miso ramen with bok choy and mushroom and just wait for it: barbecued cauliflower. Honestly, it blew me away. Every bite was surprisingly well balanced, with an incredible amount of creaminess for just vegetables. The noodles were perfectly cooked and plentiful and I was smiling the whole time. The real kicker, though, was the incredible barbecued cauliflower. The sweet smokiness was exactly what was needed to round out the dish. My only complaint was there definitely wasn't enough of the cauliflower, maybe only two or three pieces. Although I went home with leftovers, I didn't go home with any of the best part of the dish and that was a small disappointment.  Overall, I loved my experience here. I thought the food was exceptional and high quality, even offering more unique options than the traditional. I also thought the aesthetics of the location were lovely and the staff was as well! Will absolutely be coming back and will absolutely be heartbroken that the seasonal ramen is not a menu staple.",

    "text": "I decided to check this place out on Saturday night with a friend. Considering it was a Saturday night and South End was pretty busy, we got a spot right away in this cute little ramen spot.   The ambiance is nice; trendy, clean, and fun. A great spot for date night or a dinner with a couple friends. The place is small but did not feel cramped to me.  We started with the duck confit buns, which were amazing. The duck was so moist and the buns had great flavor. I got the Miso Hungry Ramen for my main entree. I've had ramen in CLT once before and was not impressed but Futo Buta was amazing! The broth had great depth, and the pork belly was nice and crispy. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the egg gave the meal a nice, hearty flavor.   I will definitely be back and would love to try the spicy tuna cakes and salmon ramen. Recommend this place for anyone looking for something different but delicious, with a trendy, intimate atmosphere.",

The atmosphere was perfect with great decor and I felt like this set up is what you would see in Japan. This restaurant is very trendy and fits the neighborhood it's located in. The chef Has clearly done his research on how the True ramen experience should be.    I ordered the tonkatsu ramen. The flavor was robust and you can tell that the broth was being cooked all day. The pieces of belly fat melted in your mouth. The homemade noodles grabbed the flavor of the broth. (Yes True tonkatsu broth is a bit oily because of the ingredients they use to make the broth). You will not find many Ramen places that makes their own noodles. This is definitely a treat! I would highly recommend this place based on the staff and the quality of food.",

Y'all, their pork belly!! Honestly, both the salmon and pork belly are perfectly smoked.  The ramen is incredible. Just get off the couch and go get some.  The fried chicken appetizer is delicious. They have some raw fish dishes that are tasty combos of ingredients. I doubt you can go wrong with anything on their menu.  Only regret: I NEVER have room for the soft serve.",

My favorite is the Fire & Ice (kimchi broth), you can spice it up more too! The salmon is also great but if you don't feel in the mood for fishy broth, they will happily serve it with any other meat. My boyfriend likes the cheese bowl, be advised it is a heck of a lot of cheese!!! We like the miso and the shoyu and the pork broth too. Yes, this is all the bowls.  A great deal of effort is obviously put into each dish and it shows. Bowls are $12-14, but be advised the bill can rise very easily with the fantastic appetizers and excellent sake selection.   Excellent atmosphere. Very friendly servers. The bar style table is a bit odd, but eating at the (actual) bar is very pleasant and the outside seating is awesome. I wish the music had a little more variety though.  I love sake and decided to have a sake flight last time. It was an excellent experience and I'd highly recommend it. I was worried the quantity of booze would be low but you get about as much sake as you would if you split a bottle with someone, and to try many new things.   Charlotte gets a bad rap for authentic food. I haven't had ramen in Japan but I've had it several other places in the US including a 3 hour wait for the legendary Yume Wo Katare in Boston. Happy to say that Futo Buta definitely measures up in my opinion - different style but the experience is on the same level.  Parking: I see reviews here saying there is only street parking? This is not True, you can park in the lot next to them, just turn past Crispy Crepe on Rensslaer ave - it looks like it's for the apartment complex but the whole first floor is clearly labeled \"Retail\" parking and is obviously for the stores there.",

The man who answered gave wonderful detailed instructions for parking and how to find the restaurant. This is one of the highlights.   We ordered 3 apps and 2 ramen to share. The Brussel sprouts were delicious and messy. The rice crispy squares with tuna was also very good though a bit too much salt. The tori Kara , Japanese fried chicken was also tasty. All three apps had enjoyable flavors though all three had a heavy salt hand.   The ramen was not good. Both flavors had no taste beyond salt , very one note. We finished all the apps and barely dented the ramen.   The sever asked us about boxing it up. When we shared our dislike, her response was- oh, sorry.   Then we received the bill. Definitely was not worth the value of what we paid.  Average joe meets boredom in food was my family's opinion.   So many other choices we'd rather have to eat.",

We tried the fire and ice with the kimchi in it and it was ok but our absolute favorite is the Miso Hungry bowl of ramen. You cannot go wrong with this bowl! It comes with Pork Belly (that is the best smoked pork belly I have ever had!), sweet corn, soft boiled egg, bok choy and the flavorful broth. We like spicy and always add the seasoning and the hot sauce as well as the chili oil. We went there last night and I am pretty sure this the best ramen Charlotte had to offer right now. We did try the duck confit and pickled carrots bun and it was good but not our favorite. The duck was not bursting with the sweet flavor confit usually has. If you are going to Futo Buta and have not been you need to start with Miso Hungry. Prices are fair and it is never bad.",

They're just like every other cookie cutter restaurant trying to make traditional Asian cuisines be \"cool\" or \"unique\" but falling painfully short.  My party came late Sunday night only to find the restaurant packed with people. While not exactly counting as points against them, we ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table. Plus, with close to freezing temperatures and a crowded inside, we had to wait outside with no working heaters.  When we were finally seated we were quickly greeted by our friendly server and given water. After waiting for so long, we already knew what we wanted: the brussel sprouts appetizer, two tonkotsu ramen, and two miso ramen. The atmosphere certainly felt like a traditional izakaya with their shared wooden benches and warm inviting lighting despite the gaudy and slightly insulting poorly drawn anime characters around and inside the bathrooms.   Shortly after ordering we got our brussel sprouts appetizer. It came out on a small square plate in a pile with bonito flakes and tako yaki sauce over the top. In terms of flavor, it was almost synonymous with the toppings of traditional tako yaki, but in a char grilled brussel sprouts medium. Overall, not bad and unique, but not amazing.  When we received our ramen, we were very impressed! They looked great, although the portions seemed a little small. However, when I first tasted the tonkotsu ramen I was shocked... shocked at how unbearably bad it was. The flavor was flat and lacked the depth and creaminess normally associated with tonkotsu ramen and was insanely salty. The egg was poached rather than hard boiled, and there was no fish cake or normal accoutrements. The only saving grace was the pork belly, which had a nice barbecue flavor and meaty and wonderfully fatty texture. After asking the waitress if it were normally this salty, she said yes and that next time I should just ask for it less salty. Well, needless to say after waiting 45 minutes and paying $14 for this mediocre portion of salty ramen, I painfully suffered through the bowl. With each spoonful, rather than wanting to slurp down the soup, I meticulously drained as much broth from the noodles as possible to avoid the jarringly salty taste. Well, after only a handful of those painful spoonfuls of broth, I was surprised to find that I had run out of noodles, leaving me yearning for more food... but sadly, not from Futo Buta.  Overall, I'd say Futo Buta aims for something higher than what they can deliver. Their atmosphere, prices, and appearance denote great food, but the taste of their staple tonkotsu ramen turns all the positives upside down. WAYYYY too salty, bland, and expensive. While service was adequate, no one likes to wait 45 min for bad food, and no one likes o be told that their tastes are not correct with the norm of the food; tastes that this particular reviewer has refined after eating some of the best ramen in the world in Japan.   If I were you, I'd avoid Futa Buta as their only redeeming quality is their braised pork belly, and barely redeeming from a 1 star at that...",

At first I assumed the restaurant was empty because no one was on the patio, but later noticed the patio was closed, likely due to the chilly weather. Inside, every table was full and a few people were waiting for seats to open up. I ordered my food to go, I got the Fire and ice bowl. It was very good. Had a strange but delicious flavor, can't quite put my finger on what the \"strange\" taste was, but I would definitely order it again. I could really taste the miso sauce on the salmon and I enjoyed the Bok choy in the broth. Price was a little steep IMO, $16 for the bowl with a fried egg ($2) but average for uptown lunch. Wait time was average, but know that this place is small. Tiny. Like standing over people while waiting to order tiny.. I would go again, but maybe before or after the lunch rush. Get there early or prepare to wait. Didn't try the ice cream this time, but they had two flavor combinations.",

I had the Tonkotsu ramen and Gyozas. Broth was bland, and didnt have that traditional opaque pork broth base to it. The egg was way to soft for ramen, and the noodles had almost a buckwheat taste. The portion was also small for the price. The best part of the ramen was the smoked pork. I will definitely be heading to Musashi on Johnston Rd. when I need my ramen fix.  I would return to Futo Buta and try other items, great atmosphere, great staff, but definitely not a spot for ramen.",

All of us order a bowl of ramen and was looking forward to a great bowl of ramen based off of the reviews that we have seen.   We all ordered the Tonkatsu ramen. When we first tried it, we weren't impressed at all. To be honest, it was very hard to even finish the bowl. We weren't the type to stop eating completely and ask to take the ramen off the bill but we had to! We couldn't take more than 3 bites.    The ramen soup was very bland. All you can really taste is the large amount of sesame oil that the soup and ramen were drenched in. It was very bad. The noodles weren't even traditional ramen noodle. I don't see how other reviewers gave this place such a good review.. Maybe it's bc they haven't tried good ramen before or even tried ramen period. Don't waste your $14 for a bowl of ramen here that's all I can say",

They don't cook the ramen stock for the necessary amount of time, but instead seem to just put it together on the fly. The fire & ice is pretty good.. but is it really ramen? Most people in Charlotte don't seem to know what real ramen is..   Yama Izakaya in Plaza Midwood has legit tonkatsu ramen broth.",

    "text": "I have been to Futo Buta twice now and every time sadly I have enjoyed almost everything else and been a bit disappointed with my ramen. Is that so bad? Not really unless you are a ramen joint, which this happens to be. womp womp womp insert sad face.  The decor is really nice here. Lots of wood tones with huge anime influence (go to the bathroom if you don't think so). Service is very nice and peppy as well and very receptive to any requests or problems you might have as well! They were super nice when I brought my baby corgi along and set out a bowl of water for him to promptly knock over.  The first time here I started with shishito peppers which were great with their soy/sesame glaze and the random hot one really caught me. A very enjoyable dish. The fried brussels sprouts are very similar in the taste department though extra umami is imparted through the bonito flakes sprinkled on top. The three ramen entrees I've tried here are the Niwa, Miso, and Tonkotsu. The noodles are nice but they always taste more like soba to me than ramen? Are they buckwheat noodles? Who knows, the broth for the tonkotsu on my first time was super fatty. In fact there was at least a centimeter of grease on top of it. Luckily our server noticed my displeasure and traded out for the Miso which was much more tolerable. The second time I just went straight for the mild Niwa (vegan) ramen. Unfortunately this is lacking a bit of flavor and salt compared to the other two. I am not saying this while biased against veggies as I grew up with a vegan mom.  I think next time I'll eat the small plates and skip the ramen. The convenience is very handy for this place's location if you take the light rail and if you take the car then there is actually some handy parking in the nearby parking garage.",

It was their \"soft opening\" so we were told some items were not available at the time and that they were working on the full menu.   We started out with the Kurobuta Pork and Golden Scallop Gyoza-these were great. Perfectly fried and it came with a side of the dipping sauce. We ordered the low country smoked pork belly and those were so tasty as well. I wish they had more than two to an order! Steamed buns are my favorite! Then we each got a ramen bowl, we had the Miso Hungry with the house signature spicy ground pork and the Shoyu Good Enough. The Miso ramen was a bit on the spicy side for me, but it had so much flavor. The Miso was a little on the salty side, but it is made with a soy based broth. Overall the ramen bowls were fantastic. The serving size was big, but filling.  I can't wait until they have their full menu so I can try out the others!",

I went to Yama because one of my friends suggested it to me when I told her about the oily and salty tonkotsu I got at Futo Buto. And I love Yama's tonkotsu! So this summer I decided to go back to futo buto and give it another try. TBH I should not have gone back. I will probably never go back. So if anyone like tonkotsu and do not like it from futo buto, I highly recommend going to Yama. But I gave them three stars because serves is great and the appetizers are great!",

The prices here are high for the portion size. The only thing worth the hype here at Futo Buta is their soft serve ice cream! Green Tea with honey drizzled on top! Wooo!

No wait on Saturday night due to the quick turn around - score. The tables are super tiny or community style. Good for them, bad for you. The restaurant is very cool with murals on the walls. Nice for a quick date. Get in, eat some funky things and get out.   We ordered and got our food super fast. I had a pineapple cocktail which was good and strong. Somehow I've never had sake so it was something new. I don't know about the price being worth it but if I'm going out, I commit. We shared four things: the dumplings - pass, the fried chicken - get, the tuna rice cracker - can't miss and the tonkotsu - tried it regardless of reviews. The dumplings were not my thing; maybe I'm just used to a pork/shrimp combo. The fried chicken was good and crunchy - mayo dipping sauce was good, the sliced peppers on the plate were hot, burning mouth death. Good nibble to start the show. The tuna/rice is a must! It's a hot/cold item that reminded us of sushi. The tuna was fresh and cold in a jar which contrasted with the warm rice served separately. I could just have had the tuna and the fried chicken and been good to go. I'd return for those. The ramen was good but not outlandishly amazing. I liked the texture of the noodles and all the critters in the bowl. I give them credit for making noodles in house; most places just use premade. I would try it again on a less full stomach. We also had the strawberry basil soft serve which was super good - you could taste both flavors, it was cool and creamy like it should be. Next time we will probably try to take the train to Futo just to add to our adventure.",

    "text": "I have to say that the establishment is nice looking inside and out. What I ate there was not what I was expecting. I read rave reviews from Yelp and had someone recommend it to me, but I was kind of disappointed. First things first before I say anything about the food: I am not a picky eater. I enjoy most of the things I eat. I am also not an expert on food, but I do know what I like and do not like.  From my (and my boyfriend's) experience:  My boyfriend had the Tonkatsu Ramen and I had a special ramen that's off their menu called the Buddha Bowl. Both were very oily, which was probably from the pork (which there was a lot of fat on), and possibly the soup. Not completely sure on the soup part though. I have eaten a lot of ramen and hand made noodles in my life, and I have to say I did not enjoy the noodles a lot. The texture was kind of off (which is weird for me to point out, because like I said I'm not a picky eater and I love all sorts of noodle dishes). The flavor of the soup from both bowls weren't fantastic as well for me/us. For me, the soup was on the salty side. Besides the ramen we ordered the Strawberry and Basil ice cream. At first I did not like the taste at all. It was different, but as I kept eating it I grew to like the taste and ended up eating all of it. I did not finish the ramen.   I gave this restaurant a rating of two stars because:  1. The place is cool looking from the inside out. Some may say it's kind of \"hipster\" looking.   2. The restaurant was a little hard to find, but eventually we found it.   3. The food did not taste good to me (besides the ice cream). Maybe the day I went the cooking was just a bit off, but I do not know unless I go again.   I do not know if I'll come here again. First experience was not fantastic, and it's a drive from where I live. If I ever have the urge to come back I will definitely try another dish and see where it takes me.",

Seating is limited in the winter since the outdoor patio is down, however management works hard to get you in when there is a wait. The menu is small which doesn't bother me especially since everything on it is fantastic (full disclosure I haven't had everything on it).  I've dined here enough times to know everything that comes out of this Chefs kitchen is made with the best ingredients, and it's highly unlikely that you would be disappointed with anything that comes out of his work space.  Started with rice crispy squares and low country smoked pork belly buns.  Main course was Miso Hungry ramen (add mushrooms and spicy ground pork),  wish I had left room for the house made soft serve (strawberry basil is my favorite).  When I left I definitely felt like a fat pig.  I knew early on this place was special and would build a cult like following.  Congratulations to the Chef, you have created something great here and I look forward to watching and participating in it continuing to blossom.",

Robust, deep, and delicious, the scallions and pickled ginger aren't just there to look pretty, they add to the flavor of the broth. The noodles are just the right texture to not get lost in the soup. The pork belly, well, I could eat a plate of it and still want more. My vegetarian friend had the Niwa ramen and raved about how delicious it was. Worst part was he refused to share.  We started with the fried Brussel Sprouts & fought over the last piece - crispy, salty, and sweet little taste bombs.   Can't wait to return.",

They were excellent.  The ramen however was not as good as I had hoped it would be! We ordered the Tonkotsu and the Buta Bowl. The broths were extremely greasy for both dishes and lacked flavor and the noodles had a somewhat gummy texture. Everything seemed really crowded in the bowls. Usually I always take my leftovers home with me but I had absolutely no desire to eat that a second time. It's really a shame since Yama is not open for lunch!",

Situated at the corner of a street, the sign of the place only appears at the front door, but not on the side of the restaurant itself, so if it wasn't for the patrons sitting outside, I might've missed it.   Ordered the toro and the Miso ramen on my visit. The toro was cut fairly thin, which is fine for nigiri, and I get that toro is expensive as hell, but having just three pieces for $16 kind of hurt internally. Especially since I've paid less for more and better fish grade for toro before.  The ramen itself had a good full flavored broth with decent fixings on it. Personally could've done without the sprouts. But that's a personal preference.  It was an okay experience.",

I had the Chizu ramen with spicy ground pork. It's delicious! Just right - one step from the ledge on the edge of being too spicy. It comes in an bowl. I used a fork but many use chopsticks. It comes separated in the bowl like a cob salad. You mix it together and then dive in.  So good. Large enough portion to feed me for lunch (and I'm 210 lbs). Afterwards all I wanted was a nap.  I'm already craving my next visit. Now is the hard part, do I get the same exact thing or venture around the menu? Expect to pay about $18 for lunch with tip and water to drink.  I see where they also have soshimi - that would be a great dinner to have that as an app.  All good.",

Before my fiance convinced me to visit here, I thought I didn't really like ramen after 2-3 mediocre restaurant experiences and the dreadful microwave cups. I've since tried ramen in quite a few different cities and have to say that Futo Buta stacks up pretty nicely with the rest. I've tried the miso, fire and ice, and the tonkatsu. I'm a big fan of the tonkatsu with its thicker broth, as well as the flavor in the fire and ice. The miso isn't my favorite flavor-wise, but my fiance likes it a lot. As is my gripe with just about every ramen place, I'd like more than one small piece of pork belly when I'm paying $10+ but still not a bad deal for all homemade, flavorful ramen.",

The apps outshine the ramen in my opinion. First time I went it was the best. Then the next couple of times I ordered the same thing (fire and ice) and ingredients were missing. Like the mint. Which is the reason for the ice part of the name. Ive stopped ordering fire and ice since then. The ice cream is probably the star of this restaurant.",

It took us a second to find it, but I'm so glad we did! The place was packed and there seemed to be a lot of to-go orders as well. We sat at the bar and Sergio helped us (he was super nice). We started with the pork belly bao. Yum. I will say the buns didn't have a ton of flavor, but the pork belly made up for it. I got the Shoyu sans egg (every bite was great-- someone else posted previously that their broth was tasteless, not the case here). Tons of noodles. The pork belly in this ramen is RIDICULOUS. He got the Tonkotsu which he loved just as much (I didn't try his since he said the broth had a cilantro taste to it). Portions are generous, we had enough to take home for leftovers. We'll be back!",

It was a soft but that's what I remember sorry about that, anyway it was decent there was a lot of extra fat on the pork belly and the service was great the prices were decent. They had a great selection of alcohol from what I recall I think I remember seeing wine and beer.  If I had to go back to this place I would recommend going after the dinner and before the lunch crowd. The soft buttons were not my thing and I'm not entirely sure if it was because I was expecting flavor but I'll have to try some at another place to compare it didn't leave me wanting more.",

    "text": "Once my co-worker and I found the restaurant (the address is very confusing to GPS aps!) we were very happy with Futo Buta.   The menu is small but that's great because it means what they offer is AWESOME.   We had some tough choices to make but we started with 2 apps to share:  the fried brussels sprouts and the Ori Kara Age, which was essentially small, fried bits of chicken over a bed of shredded cabbage.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.   The small, stacked bowl of brussels sprouts came out first, fried crispy, with sesame seeds and salt and some dark sweet sauce on top of them.  I know lots of people don't like these mini cabbages but DAMN, that's great, because there will be more for me.  I don't know how Futo Buka made these things so tasty I am just appreciative that they did.    Then came the chicken.  Crispy, salty, with a complex and interesting flavor the menu says is sea salt, ginger, fresh mint and lime.  They came with a spicy chili mayo sauce that rivaled the chicken in flavor complexity.  It wasn't just hot or just creamy.  It was both and more.  My best bite came when I grabbed some of the shredded cabbage with the chicken and dipped it in the sauce.   We both had ramen bowls as our entree.  I had the amusingly named Miso Hungry which was a miso broth combined with sweet white corn, smoked pork belly, scallion, bean sprouts, bok choy and an onsen egg. I am not ashamed to admit that I had to Google \"onsen egg.\"  It's a poached egg ball where the yolk is left runny.  In fact, the egg was barely cooked, barely holding it's shape floating in the soup.  I busted that sucker open and let the shreds of egg white solidify in the broth while the yolk dissipated into the broth, enriching it's already potent flavor.  This was the best miso soup I have ever had.  Everything about it was amazing. The pork belly was unctious and perfect. The bean sprouts were crispy tender in the soup.  All of it.  Perfect.   My coworker had the Shoyu (Good Enough) ramen and while I didn't taste it, she raved about it.  It came with smoked pork belly, bamboo, scallion, onsen egg, wakame, and roasted spring onion in a rich brown broth.    We were so disappointed that we stuffed ourselves and had no room to try the awesome sounding ice cream.   The place is small and was packed at 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon. The ambiance is hipster-chic but didn't have the snooty feel that I would normally associate with that.  We drank only water that was served in bottles on the table.  Service was prompt, friendly and prevalent.",

I asked the host what the most popular dish was and he pointed out the Miso Ramen and suggested I add the spicy pork. I did exactly that and tried the pork belly buns as well which were great. I've been a couple times and they have great seasonal specials such as small plates and even different ice cream flavors. Hoping more Korean Fare comes to Charlotte!!",

    "text": "I've been here twice now and can definitely say this place is incredible. The ramen comes in several different forms of photo worthy bowls. I have yet to take a picture of my meals there because I'm always so excited to dig in. You MUST try the  brussel sprouts and/or the pork buns! But really, try them both. Oh my gosh yum!! Neither of the two will last long because you'll be shoveling those delicious appetizers in your mouth as fast as you can chew! The steamed buns are not your typical spongy bao bun, but the flavors are fantastic like everything else I've tasted on their menu. My favorite ramen bowl is the vegan option even though I'm not a vegan. I added an egg because I just love the flavors their chef has created in the vegetable broth. I've heard it's pretty common to make changes to that bowl. It's really delicious and beautifully presented. If you enjoy a little heat, be sure to get a taste of the chili oil and spices they bring out with the ramen. If you enjoy a steamy bowl of ramen, you're going to love this place. Get here earlier than you plan to eat. There is usually a wait and it's always worth it.",

    "text": "I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.  We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.    It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.    We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.  What a terrible, awful experience.",

The pork belly buns were good, little surprised they were sliders instead of buns, but the breading was still the steamed bread you would associate with buns, delicious and I would get them again. I got the tonkotsu ramen with spicy ground pork added. The spicy pork chili was a nice addition to the dish and probably a must if you plan to get the ramen. The ramen was good, though smaller than competitor offerings and on the pricy side as a result. Tonkotsu $14 + Spicy Chili $2 and 2 pork buns $10. While I would go again, I think I favor Yama Izakaya or Musashi for ramen. I used to think Yama's ramen was pricy, but Futo Buta charges the same amount for less ramen. It used to be hard to find a place that served tonkotsu ramen, it's nice that it is becoming a more common offering. I'd try them all to pick your favorite as each was good with a slightly different take on it.  I would have given them at least a 4 for quality of their food, but they are definitely overpriced.",

    "text": "Futo Buta is the MUCH needed, refreshingly different resturaunt that Charlotte definitely has been lacking. A client of mine actually referred me there and I couldn't believe that I had not heard of it. My wife and I went there and have probably been their once a week since either takeout or dine in. When we dine in, we love to be helped by Janelle however it is often very busy so we will take whoever we are assigned and are always happy. If you happen to get Janelle as your server, then that is a bonus. She carries a huge smile and gives us great recommendations and is very attentive to us. The space is small but cozy. The patio is nice, especially with the heated lamps. We always get the rice krispy squares and the pork belly buns to start. Both are great appetizers that have tons of flavor. The krispy squares are shareable among 3 people but could very easily be eaten by 2 people. The pork belly buns are simple and are made up of 2 servings. I usually get the tonkotsu because it's a little more creamy and my wife gets the Miso Hungry. Both are great options. If you want a little bit of a kick, the fire and ice is great also. If you haven't yet had Futo Buta then this is a must for you especially if you are craving something different than what Charlotte usually offers! Thanks Futo Buta",

The Ramen is so good. The whole menu is great. The sake selection is top notch and they Mexican Coke (I mean the soda, not the other, you know what never mind). Besides the drinks and main course, the Brussels sprouts and pork belly are to die for. Writing this makes me want some right now. Staff is always friendly no matter how busy they are.

We also got ice cream before we left which I highly reccomend ! The green tea and honey is delicious. I dropped a star just because it's so difficult to find and the quality of the Uni was lacking.

Our waiter was awesome- he answered all the questions we had, directed us to things to try, since we were newbies and was really informed on EVERYTHING.  I ordered the Tonkotsu -- which was amazing! The flavors meld into this wonderfully warm dish. The pork belly was delicious! The weather was super damp and cold, so this was even better! I also had the Warm Apple Sake, totally delicious!  I'm sad to say I didn't have any soft serve ice cream, but can't wait to try it next time. I also saw tea pots, which leads me to believe they will have hot tea soon!   You should know that this is set up like a traditional noodle house, seating is very close and it can get loud. I think it just adds to the ambiance. Go out and enjoy something different!",

I decided to google \"best Ramen in Charlotte\" and Futo Buta came right up! I text one of my girlfriends to meet me there and off we went to have our Ramen adventure. While it's not the easiest place to find if you're not familiar with the area, it being tucked away a bit, it is an extremely wonderful, fantastic find.

The fried chicken was good too, super crispy with a good dipping sauce (I saw someone else eating it, so I ordered it, and then someone asked me what I was eating, so it must be a trend!).   The ramen was really good too, I liked that the broth wasn't too salty, and the noodles were the good, wavy noodles. The pecan smoked pork belly was delicious! They're a very professionally run restaurant- I ate my appetizers first, and it was nice not to have my ramen come out while I was eating my first course.  Their mango yuzu soft serve was delicious- refreshing, creamy and cool. It wasn't overly sweet or fake-fruit tasting but was a subtle, bright flavor mixed in. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!",

If you want ramen broth that you don't have to ask for various seasons they offer then this is not the place. The noodles are said to be made in house but I didn't see much differentiation from it to those sold in the grocery store. The best thing I had here was the pork belly buns because the meat was done perfectly on the grill. Also I am not a fan of the community seating concept where you share a table with random people so if you are going here on a first date this would not be the place to go. Be prepared to have a wait here because there are not many tables and it is a place the locals in the neighborhood frequent to hangout for drinks. I doubt I would make a return visit here but if you want a better/authentic ramen experience in Charlotte I would recommend Yama Izakaya.",

I encourage anyone who goes there to try the Brussels Sprout appetizers - in one word OUTSTANDING!  They are both crisp, fresh and sweet all at the same time. We also love the Rice Crispy Squares.   My go to is always the Miso.  It is a warm broth with fresh corn, bean sprouts, Bok Choy, pork belly and an egg.  It is delicious - pork melts in your mouth and the veggies, noodles remain crisp and delicious!   My husband gets the Buta Bowl it has a bit of a kick but never fails to impress!   Truly a great restaurant - worth the wait!  I love the traditional Japanese sitting - if not for that we would have never tried the Brussels Sprouts!   Great service, excellent food and reasonable prices!  Love that it's right off the train -",

We were seated after about 20-25 minutes at around 1 pm. The seating isn't great, very small space so you will have to sit right next to other parties at the same table if you go at busy times. I saw two separate couples sharing one four top table. If you're cool with that, by all means go for it! Luckily, my friend and I got seated at the bar so this didn't happen for us. I ordered the miso ramen bowl and it was pretty good! I like my ramen spicy so I asked for the table top spices, which come free of charge and is composed of sirracha and chile oil. For the price, I was a little disappointed with the portion size. The ramen was good, but for a $14 meal I would've expected a bigger bowl and definitely more meat! I would come back to Futo Buta but probably order something new, as I wasn't a huge fan of how fatty the pork belly in the miso was.",

I ordered the brussel sprouts and the miso ramen. The brussel sprouts were delicious and quite large. If you want, you can request extra spices and sauces to put on your brussel sprouts. The spicy sesame oil was my favorite! The miso ramen was okay. The noodles did not have the mouthfeel or look like authentic ramen noodles, but instead tasted more like noodles from a maruchan cup ramen. The broth also didn't have a lot of depth of flavor. I did like that they gave you a lot of food, so it felt like I got my money's worth here.",

Exceptional customer service with a few servers, who always treat me like family when I'm there.   You can tell the manager/owner of this place is well-experienced in the Ramen business, who had a careful vision of his concept in the centerfold of Southend. It's a tight-knit ramen bar that encourages a communal vibe for customers to interact, yet also insinuates an atmosphere of Japanese-American influence.  Is this the best ramen I've ever had? No. Is it the best in Charlotte? IMO YES. My usual is the Tonkostu with extra spicy (crack) ground pork you can add on the side. Also don't forget one of their signatures apps...the Rice Crispy Squares! It's the perfect finger food you need on a date - an FYI to all those singles out there.   This place never disappoints.",

I feel like a rock star when I eat at Futo Buta. Lots of energy here. Good times without feeling rushed. This last time I had the Miso (Hungry) with spicy pork added. Just an excellent bowl of food. I also tried the Rice Crispy Squares for the first time and I'm hooked. Rustic art work you can eat - spicy tuna on crisped rice squares make for a \"sushi like\" experience but with a wild and clever textural twist! Oh and those Red Miso Glazed Tofu Skewers rock my world! Great selection of sakes and local craft beers.  Definitely a cool place for a meal with friends or even a solo flight for a pig out session!  Go Go Futo Buta!!!",

    "text": "My favorite ramen spot in Charlotte - so delicious!  Although the restaurant is pretty tiny and hard to find, Futo Buta makes up for it with their delicious, flavorful food. We enjoyed our Gyoza and Japanese Fried Chicken appetizers, but fell in love with the ramen entrees. Not sure you can go wrong with any of the bowls, but my boyfriend and I love to split the Buta Bowl ($18). This is the priciest ramen on the menu - but so worth it because of the MASSIVE PORTIONS. Definitely enough to keep us both full and snack on more appetizers/desserts! The Buta Bowl has so many things in it (egg, pork belly, pork, corn, etc) and the broth is the perfect amount of spicy.   We love the food here, but also the authenticity of the restaurant itself. Like I said, because it's tiny, there is one family table in the center where people sit directly next to each other. There are also other tables and seats at the bar and the outdoor patio, but it's a really nice feeling to all sit together and enjoy a nice, warm bowl of ramen. Super welcoming atmosphere and service.   Can't wait to return on my next trip to Charlotte!",

Crowds wait outside but after experiencing the deliciousness you know why they wait.  We started out with the Slow Cooked Pork Belly buns.  Two in an order and I shared with my husband.  I wish I had ordered my own.  The best pork belly I have ever had.  This is a definite order when coming here.  When you take your first bite you'll know exactly what I mean.     We then moved onto the Ramen.  I chose the Shoyu.  A few large pieces of that awesome pork belly I spoke about with fresh veggies, seaweed and a pouched egg.  While the bowl doesn't look too big it was packed with tons of ramen noodles.  The broth was rich and flavorful.  I almost felt my brown was bottomless.  But it did have an end which satisfied me completely.    Service was friendly and efficient.  They obviously know how to keep things moving especially when they have lots of hungry patrons waiting.  This was a wonderful experience.  I can't wait to enjoy again soon!",

The tonkatsu broth was thick yes, but it was totally flavorless otherwise. Can't tell if they layered in other dashi or even added a salt component. The noodles are also over cooked - by the time I was halfway done, they were so soggy. Nothing in my bowl was seasoned. Hugely disappointed.   The only good part of my meal was the charred pieces of pork. That was well cooked, so props because usually it can be dry.   To qualify myself, I've lived in NYC for 5 years and have also had my fair share of ramen in Japan, so I feel like I have enough bowls to compare this to.",

My boyfriend and I were sat at the community table across from one another that was weirdly high-- if I was just one or two inches shorter, eating ramen at that table would have been a challenge to avoid elbowing my neighbor in the face.  - Wagyu Tartare: 5/5 - This was the highlight of the lunch. The truffle flavor really came through on this. Taro chips were a great compliment to the beef!  - Tonkotsu Ramen: 2/5 - Man. This was so so fatty. Comparable to what a tsukemen broth would be like. After 15 minutes, I was starting to feel queasy. - Fire and Ice Ramen - 4/5 - I had to sneak some of the broth from my boyfriend's bowl to try to lighten up my palate. The flavor was SO good! Unlike any flavor I've ever had in ramen. Spicy with some sour - this was pretty good.  I probably wouldn't return if I was craving ramen again- the wagyu tartare though.... that was definitely the star.",

This is supposed to be a \"family friendly\" restaurant (hints why they have high chairs) and the staff didn't prove that, especially the bus girl. She was a short chubby Hispanic looking lady with long black hair. My son was enjoying his rice and noodles and like every baby/kid they tend to make a mess but this lady was not having it and seemed to be very frustrated every time she walked by our table looking at my son and his mess and just making faces which was very disturbing to me bc HES A BABY! What do you expect him to do. (Mind you I'm the type of mom that if they make a huge mess I will literally pick the big pieces they drop and help out in that way bc I've been a server before) but this lady literally pissed me off when my son dropped his to-go cup (mind you the water didn't spill out bc there was barely any water in it) she literally looked at me nodded her head and walked right passed it without kindly picking it. I'm not saying this to make it seem like they're there to do every single thing for me, no. But she was just rude. She was more at reach to it than I was since I was in a corner blocked off with my sons high chair. But, that was not what pissed me off the most. When I paid and left, my brother and his friend stayed behind and overheard her say to the next table that sat next to us \"idk why she would bring her baby here and have him make a mess\" like are you serious???? What kind of service is that????? He's a freaking baby and this is soo disrespectful to moms bc what are we supposed to do??? Stay stuck inside the house bc rude people like you don't like kids??? I eat out a lot and I have never felt so disrespected for being a mom with a social life. The staff does not make it seem like a family friendly environment, so I am not sure why they even provide high chairs if they don't welcome baby's. I won't be there again and I will def pass this message a long to every mom I know. Better start looking for another Raman place bc there service is not worth it, plus have a low sanitation score like that.. no, thank you!",

It has double noodles with smoked pork belly, an egg and duck confit. This was my first time so I cant contest to a change in their noodles. I thought they were pretty al dente and I liked the texture. The broth was not my favorite though. It was saltier then I would like. If the Buta bowl wasn't rich enough, we ended the meal with the green tea ice cream ($5). I've had a lot of green tea ice cream- save your calories.",

It was inviting, especially on a dark cold evening. The space inside is quaint, in other words, you will cozy up to your neighbors very closely. Your conversation is theirs and their conversation is yours. I didn't mind that too much, it kind of added to their atmosphere. The pictures on the walls, and even the bathroom door is kitschy, like you walked into an anime comic book.  I found it to be fun.   The service was efficient and the food came out rather quickly. The bowls are deceptively deep so you get quite a big and complete meal with one ramen bowl. I got their signature Fire and Ice which is really good. It has salmon and just a hint of spice. My friend got the tonkotsu- it was very rich and fatty. With some hot sake, it was a perfect dinner for a frigid night.  But as I was finishing up, a girl came to clean the table next to me. Like I said, the tables are all stacked very closely together, so when she sprayed the tables to clean, I could feel a sprinkling on my arm. Not sure sure if it went into my water or bowl, but I was definitely done at that point. It was a startling end to an otherwise good meal.",

I didn't find it appetizing. I actually forced myself to take a few more bites because I didn't want to waste my money. I also got the pork bun which was just subpar. Way overpriced for what it is.

Friends who went last week warned me that it was meh-- expensive for what they got and nothing special. But I decided to give this place a try anyway. I was sorry I did. The inside space is pretty cramped, and there's basically one long communal table and then some small tables in the back. I got the hungry miso ramen which had no flavor. The waiters were friendly enough and were very knowledgeable about the menu. But for a main dish, I was very sad about my experience and wish I hadn't paid $12 for what essentially tasted like a bowl of water with a small amount of pork stuck in it.",

Then I got the Buta Bowl of ramen, figuring it was the house specialty, and that was INSANELY delicious. The server did warn me that it was spicy, and it's extremely rare that I find something too spicy so I thought that was fine, but this soup was SPICY. So delicious and so spicy. I commented to one of the servers that it was really spicy, sort of laughingly explaining my teary eyes, and she told me with that dish it's best to order the spicy stuff on the side (the broth itself isn't spicy, I think) and kindly offered another bowl of broth to cut the spice down a bit, which with some shame I took. That made it all better, but also even MORE food on top of this already very generous portion, and they gladly wrapped my leftovers which I will be devouring pretty much as soon as there is room in my stomach again. The best thing I've done in 3 days in Charlotte!",

I really want to love this place but the foods are mediocre (even considering the fact that I'm no where near a ramen snob). Noodles were handmade daily, but the texture were lacking. The soups were okay, more a blend of Asian flavors (pho/Chinese/Japanese) than anything else. Overall, this place is great for hangout, but if you are looking for real ramen flavors, your taste buds definitely won't be satisfied when walking out of the door.",

The office managers are so easy to work with and treat us like family.  The apartments are very roomy and fashionable.  I love our new gym and huge pool that even has handicap availability.

Futo Buta is nestled along the light rail in the Southend are of Charlotte close to Bland Street by all of the bars like All-American Pub and Slate.  For a gourmet noodle house the eats are reasonably priced.  I almost always order the Tonkotsu which consists of creamy pork broth, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, organic mushroom, onsen egg*, pickled ginger, seaweed, sesame, black garlic.  The ingredients are a courtesy of their website.  On a nice cool or warm summer night this is a great date spot.  There's outdoor seating so you can people watch and see the hustle and bustle of the light rail and the neighborhood people jogging or just enjoying the gorgeous days we have in Charlotte.  Check this place out because it is definitely now on you to-do list.",

She had miso and I the tonky one. Both were delicious. The miso had sweet corn that was al dente and perfect for the flavor. Our eggs were cooked properly and the pork belly was super tender and not overwhelming in the dish. We disagree with most on the value/flavor issue in that having too much pork weighs down the intricate flavors. I had the spicy ground pork added, and that was a mistake as it left a gross orange grease puddle on the surface. Once that was removed the dish was lovely.  We will definitely return.",

The ramen is very good.  Other dishes are interesting as well.  Would like to see a seafood ramen offered with some more traditional ingredients as well as the chef's creations.  Need to get back soon to try the donburi and buns.  Only downside is that, in view of the limited seating, the wait can sometimes be long.  And unless the patio is available, this is probably not a good place for a large crowd (6+ people).",

Futo Buta specialises in Ramen and Saki, but you'll find other modern Japanese items on the menu as well. I had one the Ramen soup bowls and it was hearty, flavorful and delicious ! I also had a sweet tooth and tried their Green Tea ice cream It's phenomenal ! In addition to Saki, the bar has a selection of Japanese and Craft Beers as well. In addition of great food, drinks and atmosphere, the staff are professional, courteous, and engaging. There's no doubt in my mind I'll return to Futo Buta .  Domo Arigato !",

Extremely salty.  Could not taste the broth.  Menu does not mention that ALL noodles are wheat (made in house).  Broth  and noodles are so.important for good ramen!  Maybe people that are giving this place good reviews don't know what good Japanese ramen is.  It's very disappointing. Don't waste your time or money.  Seriously. Service: We only saw Janeille to take our order and pick up our tab.  Never checked in on us.  I was waiting, because I wanted to see the menu again.  Eventually had to flag down another waitress.  When Janeille picked up our tab, I asked if we maybe had had a choice of noodle ... an option that maybe maybe we had missed she informed me that this is a \"traditional\" Japanese restaurant.  If I wanted choices, a Vietnamese restaurant is where we should go.  What?  We know what traditional Japanese ramen is...she informed me that this is traditional Japanese with a southern twist.  Where or what was the twist?  I also mentioned to her that the broth was extremely salty, as she walked away she flipantly said she'd mention so, to someone.  Really, she could care less.  Never saw her again. So, I'm giving this place a 1 star.  Food was junk.  Customer service tacky.",

I have to give them an A for effort as the menu is well conceived.  Unfortunately the ramen itself was far from Meriting the 4 star review.  The noodles believe it or not were of the store bought 59 cent a package variety.  No kidding!!!  The broth itself was ok but certainly not a 24 hour bone broth as it should be.  The added ingredients were good.  People!  We must use Yelp as a platform to raise the level of excellence for all.  This is not a great Ramen shop but maybe they could get better or maybe their success will inspire a great Ramen chef to open up something more definitive.",

Having read several reviews before arriving, I decided to order the Crispy Rice Squares with Tuna and the Fried Chicken.  By far the Crispy Rice will bring me back.  Rice squares cooked just right to give them a crisp outer crust.  Top them with tuna tartar and dip in soy sauce, heaven.  I cannot describe how good they were. As for the chicken, when you think of the word fried, these should be what you think of. They are fried to perfection, not greasy, but I missed the chicken flavor, as it was very subtle. They are served with an aioli which was great, but even the soy did the trick. Overall, Futo Buta is a definite spot Charlotte needs and I will look forward to getting back and trying their ramen, as well as ordering the Crispy Rice Squares again!",

Peppers app was greasy with no flavor and steamed bun apps had absolutely no flavor and really no sauce.  I carry my own finishing salt and man did I have to use it... Two stars were because of the Brussels that were actually good! Staff was rude at best, if you can even figure out who is waiting on you. And I get the cool theme but at lunch to have heavy metal blaring so loud you can't hear someone talk... just not my style.  For a $50 lunch I can find many more places to spend that money and enjoy!",

Like it's been siting out for a while, I know it wasn't because you can see the kitchen and the orders come right there where you can see them coming out. I thought it was going to be boiling hot like all of the other ramen I have had.

It has so much flavor and was tender, but not too tender. Oh, I will dream about the pork until next time.

The address listed on Yelp does not lead you to the restaurant, but thankfully to Yelp tips, I was able to find parking and figure out where it was.  Lunch time gets quite busy and the location is small, but they have a very efficient waiting/seating process. They'll take your name down and text you when you're ready to be seated and you can also view where your spot is in line. Also, there is community seating so they can accommodate more people since the location is fairly small.  Now onto the food! For appetizers, we had the rice crispy squares and the salmon belly nigiri. Both were FIREEEE. The rice crispy squares were toasted rice squares that came with spicy tuna and wasabi soy sauce. Loved the combo, I would highly recommend trying it. I also loved the yuzu mayo they used for the salmon belly nigiri, though it was a nice touch of flavor, very unique.  We also tried the miso and tonkatsu ramen, loved the broth. Very rich and flavorful, and each came with an onsen (hot spring) egg which is slow cooked and similar to a poached egg. The mix of pork, noodles, and broth was to die for and perfect for a cold day. The portions are large so you'll leave feeling full. Overall, not the best ramen I've had but definitely one that satisfies the soul. Food all came out quick and service was exceptional. Will be back if we're ever in town again!",

We came in and noticed that it was very tight inside. The seats aren't the most comfortable, especially not for a pregnant woman. They have bar height tables and stools so it's not really the place to go, find a comfy spot, and stay a while. This is more so an \"in and out\" type of restaurant. I ordered \"The Little Noodle\" bowl and added black garlic oil, mushrooms, and scallions. My husband ordered the \"Fire and Ice\" bowl that he was told is very popular. I LOVED my bowl! It came out piping hot and I was too impatient to let it cool off because it smelled so yummy! They give you plenty of ramen so I had plenty left over for lunch the next day which tasted just as yummy after being reheated! I also ordered the green tea and honey ice cream and it was absolutely AMAZING!! I wish it came with a spoon instead of the wooden spoon because mine became splintered and I wasn't able to inhale the ice cream like I really wanted to. All in all, I was very pleased with our experience but will probably either decide to sit on the patio or take our food to go in an effort to avoid the seating situation.",

The pork buns and wagyu tartare were amazing...make sure you look over the fresh sheet.  There are lots of nice sake and beers but try the frozen beer slushie...really good. We had a great young man at the bar as our server.  Service is quick and accurate.",

    "text": "I wish i could give them 10 stars!!!  This is by far my favorite Ramen stop in Charlotte. If anyone visits me from out of town and likes Ramen , this is the first and only place i will take them. The bowls are made with love and it seeps into the delicious taste of the Ramen.  Get the Budda Bowl if your nice and hungry it comes with double the noodles and all the veggies you can think of, don't forget to add some spice to give it an authentic \"kick\" that will make the broth slurping even more decadent. Also you MUST TRY THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS it's a great symmetry between Japanese cuisine and American flare.   The seating is limited but the low amount of seating adds to the ambience and sitting next to another customer allows for conversation and great suggestions for first timers.  Pros  - Great local spot off the Bland St light rail station  - Vegetarian Options available  - Kind staff that will help with recommendations if needed  - A good size parking lot next to the Beasley Media building   Cons - During the dinner rush there may be a good wait  Pro Tip - if you have a long wait head over to Slate  or All American Pub for a quick drink while you wait  - TRY THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS!!! ( I have to say it again )",

Sunday night and a bit of a wait. About 20 minutes to get a table for two, so not bad.   We stuck with the standards- pork belly buns, tonkatsu and shoyu.   All three were good solid citizens. No stinkers.  I did think the tonkatsu broth was not as rich as I'd hoped. It certainly looked the part and the garnishes were on point. But the broth was really just okay.  It hurts me to say that.  Still I'd recommend and will come again.   4 solid stars for good, trendy ramen joint.",

There's not much flavor in it, but the pork that comes in the broth is very delicious; packed with the flavor. So this could be what balance out the broth in the ramen? The place itself is very small so it could get very crowded. I would still recommend people to come to try it themselves, but as for me I probably would come back here and there.",

    "text": "On a Saturday afternoon, I hit up Futo Buta with a friend for a late lunch. We found street parking close by. Even though Futo Buta is a relatively small restaurant, I was happy that there wasn't a wait. While we were seated promptly, our waitress was slower than molasses. She checked in with us soon after we were seated to bring us water but then took forever to come back to take our orders. If I didn't enjoy the food so much, I'd give Futo Buta three stars due to the poor service. Hopefully, this isn't representative of all of the waiters here.   I don't have ramen often but it's always a treat. Futo Buta has a creative menu. I went with one of their chicken-based broths which came with green onions, sweet corn, pork belly, and a seasoned egg. The broth was delicious, as were the noodles. What really stood out to me was the quality of the pork belly. I'm generally not a big fan because it's so fatty but Futo Buta was an exception to the rule. The crusted pork belly had a nice crisp to it and a lot of flavor.   Next time around, I'd love to try their classic Tonkotsu.",

We started with wine and a lychee/sake cocktail. I was pleasantly surprised as it wasn't as sweet as I expected.   For appetizers we got the pork belly bao buns and the rice crispy squares. The rice crispy squares are a MUST. One of my favorites from them. The bao buns were great too. Some of the best bao buns I've had in the city now that I think about it.   For dinner we got the duck confit rice bowl and the fire and ice salmon ramen. The ramen is fantastic. I will stray from this dish and get other ramen and still come back to it. So much flavor! Also, the rice bowl was a pleasant surprise. The duck was great, and I loved it with the chili oil. I was so distracted by the good food my husband found me eating the food with my chop sticks backwards lol.   We finished with the spicy mango ice cream. So yummy! Don't sleep on their ice cream. Small portion that's doable after a big dinner and great, homemade flavors.   Oh futo buta, I won't forget about you ever again. Please accept my apology.",

I wish these weren't as expensive since the portions could be bigger/better.  Tonkotsu Ramen - as good as it gets in Charlotte.  Ikura/Toro Donburi - Not sure if this was a special as I couldn't find it on the menu but this was the clear winner of the night.  Excellent fusion of flavors that brought forth a wave of umami that left me craving the rest of dinner.  Like the Terminator, \"I'll be back\".",

Everything I've ever had here has always been delicious.   I finally dragged my girlfriend here since she's yet to try traditional ramen so we ordered the rice crispy squares (my convincing point to coming here), the Japanese fried chicken and the pork belly buns along with sharing the Tonkotsu and ending with some soft serve (strawberry basil and mango yuzu). To say we were full is definitely an understatement and everything was fantastic. Thumbs up to our server, Khiem, for all the recommendations, insightful tips on the food and service. It always helps especially when you bring someone new to try a new cuisine :-)  We spent about $60 between the both of us which is definitely reasonable and you can find parking in the garage connected to the building if you decide to drive into Southend. You can park for about 3 hours so it's more than enough time if you are coming during peak hours as sometimes the wait can be anywhere from 30 min to an hour. It's not a big place but I love the communal style seating.",

Parking is available at the Post South End apartment complex, they have parking just for Post South End shopping. The wait can be long but worth it- they take down your name and number and text you when your table is available. Perfect time to take a walk along the light rail and pre-work off some of the amazing calories you're about to consume. We got the Shoyu and Miso and loved both of them. I like how the sauces and spicy pepper is already on the table, no need to wait for them to bring it to you. Oh and the bathrooms are super cute!",

Enough for leftovers or to share for 2.  Also ordered the edamame.. wish it was more flavorful, it was a tad bland.   Other than that, I really liked it! Friendly staff as well, they seemed very packed on Sunday evening!",

    "text": "Alright let's lay this review out by components of the ramen. I got the shoyu because I'm not a big fan of tonkotsu.  Noodles: cooked al dente 5/5 Broth: flavor was there but was a little too fatty 4/5 Pork: charred outside and tender on the inside. Probably the best part of the bowl 8373638/5 Egg: poached egg instead of the usual boiled salt egg with a runny center 1/5 Other toppings: love the bamboo shoots but wish they had some naruto 4/5  I'd say overall it's pretty good but not great. Prices are on the pricey side for Charlotte at $13.",

    "text": "Huuuu... I hate do this. This used to be my fave Ramen Spot... USED to be. But they have seriously gone downhill. The last few times the noodles have been undercooked and just.... different. But THIS visit, not only were my noodles underdone, but there were a fewf other issues.   After sitting down, we were given water. When we asked for straws, dude took his two bare fingers, placed them around our straws and handed them to us. Ill. Come on now. I know you're busy, but you either could have a. handed us the cup to grab our own or, b. took a napkin to get our straws. I'm sorry, but I'm a germaphobe and to wrap my lips around a straw that had someone else's hands on them and who knows what, from working in a restaurant is a no-no for me. I got up, took two steps to the spot where they have straws, flatware, etc and got my own. I get there are things that may or may not go on in a kitchen that can cause germs, but to see this... in my face. Nah son.   I ordered the Buns for an app and besides the filling, the buns were not good at all. Are they supposed to be fried??? Cause mine were. I thought they were supposed to be pillowy and lightly sweetened. Lightly! They were really sweet and just a bit unappetizing. I was tempted to take the filling out and just eat that cause it was pretty good. But the overall bun was not doing it for me. Perhaps it was an off day?   I ordered my usual Miso, minus the bok choy and after taking the first bite I didn't taste anything. Doth my tastebuds deceive me??? Nah, this ain't right chief, let me try again... NOPE! No flavor! AT ALL! Come on man! So you mean to tell me not only are my noodles undercooked, but there is no flavor to my broth... the very thing that makes a good bowl of ramen??? Huuuu... We ordered the fried chicken (can't remember the name) appetizer.  After my dude added some of the sauce from that to his ramen, I decided to do the same. It helped... A LOT! But I shouldn't have had to do that. Whatever, I'm hungry... I'm going to finish it.   I was willing to let the undercooked noodles go, but this last time has really put me off; especially since I was really looking forward to a good bowl of ramen, on account of it being my birthday and I ditched my healthy diet for this? Damn! Sayonara Futo... it was good while it lasted.",

I interacted with maybe 5-6 employees and they were all super friendly.! I ordered the traditional ramen with the black garlic oil. The broth is AMAZING and the noodles are perfect. The pork belly is delicious as well. Tinder and juicy... All of the components work together cohesively. This ramen is just as good as what I've had in Tokyo.  I will definitely be making this place my go-to for ramen. I also want to try the sushi here though... it also looks pretty good! I strongly recommend this place for your next noodle fix :)",

I ordered the miso ramen and it was good, but not something I would order again, I don't  think. I did eat it  so it wasn't bad - just not for me. I'm sure for someone more familiar with ramen it would be great.  The food was beautiful! And appetizing to look at. And I might try it again.

Disregard the drool   This place is located at the light rail in South End. I learned of this restaurant via Yelp a couple of years ago and had it bookmarked to visit for a very long time. I one day (Spring 2016) decided to go find this place whose food I've drooled over on Yelp & IG and try it myself. I did just that and was happy with my food choices and my visit. I then shared the good word with many afterwards and planned to head back and just never made it back until just recently when an associate and I planned to have lunch and I thought it would be perfect to go have ramen. This is when I discovered the Brussels (OoooMMMMGGGGGEEE) which were AwwwMazing. I'm a Brussels Sprout snob so believe me these are awesome.  Parking here can be tricky as there is parking for all retail including Futo around back in a garage. The downside to that is the horrific smell of the garbage that you have to walk through to get to the restaurant (insert a GAG face).  Try this place out it's yummy.",

Thanks to all of you who told me exactly how to get there because she and I met there, and I would've been lost! Park behind Crispy Crepe and walk toward the light rail.  I was the first one there at 11:30 (they open at 11:00), and I was immediately greeted and ushered into the small dining area. There are a ton of tables with umbrellas outside along the light rail, but it was muggy and I couldn't have mushroom hair the rest of the day. Our verrrry enthusiastic, verrry chatty waiter got me some water while I waited for my friend, and when he found out I hadn't been there before, he literally told me about every single item on the menu. Wowie.   For lunch, I got the pork belly bun ($10) and Brussels sprouts ($7). They were delicious, but the pork belly bun was only 2 smalls buns, and the sprouts fit on a tiny plate. With tax and tip, I spent $22 on lunch. What the what?! My friend was the same way. She got the Rice Crispy Squares and the eggplant and zucchini bun and spent $21 plus tax and tip. Let me repeat - ON LUNCH.   Although the food was good, I won't be in a hurry to go back til at least the lunch prices go down a little.",

The address is a bit misleading, it takes a few minutes to figure out it's around the block and in the back left of the building by the railroad tracks. Don't let your GPS fool you.  I really enjoyed the Vegetarian/Vegan options. Shishito Peppers, Red Miso Tofu, and fried Brussels Sprouts were great (I scraped off the Bonito flakes). The Niwa Ramen was very good, though a little plain (the noodles were the star, not so much the broth). I spiced it up with Shichimi powder and some hot chili oil and it really came to life. The Eggplant and Zucchini bun was delicious, though a bit pricey at $10. I was able to see a lot of interesting dishes on other tables, it really did remind me of my time in Japan. Enjoy!",

Fire and Ice Ramen was a good size, but there's only ONE size:( The place is obviously in a super trendy spot and extremely small so needless to say it was packed! We were told we'd have to wait 25 mins but we were seated after about 10 mins! You may end up with strangers at your table due to the limited seating.  By the way, the bar area is not first come first serve, you have to put your name on the waiting list for a stool. Have a look at the menu BEFORE you come in, the waitress was ready to take our order after like 3 mins of sitting down. My friends and I felt totally rushed. Fortunately the food made up for the rushed service and seat next to the restroom. I would return again but probably get it to go, or wait until the summer when the outdoor seating is available.   P.

The only thing I can say I didn't enjoy was the pork belly slices, but then again it is traditionally a fatty piece of meat and I tend to shy away.   As it starts to get colder, take note that the building is small, so a wait may become plausible. Additionally, they have very communal tables - can be uncomfortable at first but it's easy to ignore, or just make new friends!",

I went on a Saturday night around 7pm with a friend, and everything from the wait staff to the atmosphere to the ramen was fantastic. The pork belly used in both my shoyu ramen and my companion's tonkatsu bowl was smoked with pecan involved somehow and holy mother of god it was so good. Seriously. Get the pork if your dietary habits allow it.  Slight tangent for people after lemonade in the Yelp search bar- their strawberry lemonade is killer. I've never had anything like it. It came out of a metal brewer-type dispenser like those used for tea, which makes me think they really do make it by batch with real fruit. (Don't quote me on that or anything because I didn't think to ask, just know that it was definitely one of a kind.) They had a pretty extensive sake list, as well, from what I saw.  My only surprise (and I wouldn't even consider this a complaint, just an unexpected twist) was that the space in Futo Buta really is a premium, seemingly modeled after traditional ramen houses. It got a little crowded once the football crowd came around, but I figure my surprise was just my Southern upbringing where people anticipate miles between each table, haha. Overall awesome experience.",

Other than the crowded conditions (which comes with a smaller place), the rest of the experience was not less than amazing.  Stared off with a glass of sake, which the bartender handed me a info card showing all information about the sake. Very nice touch.  The appetizer (or izakaya) was Fried red meal tofu skewers. Two skewers with three pieces of tofu on each, coated with a spicy red miso and sesame seeds.  The ramen bowls for each came next and they did not disappoint. I had the Buta Bowl, a spicy mix with smoked pork belly, duck confit, and spicy pork. Incredible flavor combinations the wonderfully changed with every bite. My son had the Fire and Ice, a kimchi and dashi broth base with smoked salmon and assorted vegetables. The little that I had ( my son devoured it quickly) had just enough heat from the kimchi to notice, and the beautiful smoky flavor from the salmon topped the flavors wonderfully.  Finishing off the experience was ice cream, green tea and honey for my son and I had the cinnamon and fig.  This is somewhere that I with most assuredly return to at the earliest time to see what other delights I can discover there.",

    "text": "I've been anticipating this spot for a few months now. Ever since I snagged a glimpse of it while it was being built-out during a stroll on the light rail path I've been patiently awaiting some delicious noodles.  I usually wait at least until my second visit before rating a new joint but I couldn't help it here. It's great to see a genuine ramen place in Charlotte and this place offers everything I would have hoped for. The venue itself, although struggling a bit on the parking front, it is in a great location. Anyone living in South End of course doesn't have an issue as this place is pretty much walkable from anywhere in the neighborhood. It was raining the day I checked it out so we headed inside and grabbed a table for two. The seats are spaced very closely to other parties but I've actually seen this in a lot of Japanese restaurants in Japan so for me, only made it a more authentic experience.  Given that it was my first visit, I opted for the classic tonkotsu ramen to get a good sense of the \"basics\". However, I was very tempted by the Fire and Ice on the menu which the waitress did mention was one of the more popular dishes - there's always next time.  The tonkotsu was really very good. To be fair I haven't had authentic ramen in a while but from what I do remember of it, this was right on par...or better than what I've had in the past.  On my next visit the Fire and Ice and gyoza are both on the short list of what needs to get eaten. I'm certain that the bottom of the ramen bowls here haven't seen the last of me!",

I'm sure this small place gets super busy on a weekend for dinner, especially if the outdoor area is not open. The outdoor area is very large however if it's raining, you will be sitting super close to others in the 30 seat dining area inside. The ramen noodles and broth are all prepared in house daily and you can tell. The service is excellent. The sake flights for $15 are a fun addition. I will be back!!",

    "text": "Gave futo buta a try with friends who were in town and would give it 3.5 stars. Overall, our food was decent but the prices were a bit high for Charlotte. If I wanted DC prices...I would go get DC ramen :) We met at 5:30 on a Thursday and had our choice of seating. When we left at 7pm, there was a wait for a table. So arrive early! There is outside seating, but in the heat, very few patrons selected that option.   Location: hard to find! Park in Post Southend Apartments (entrance off Bland, just before/after the light rail tracks by All American Pub). Park in the level 1 retail parking and exit out the back of the deck (where the dumpsters are). If you head toward the Charlotte Trolley Museum, you'll see Futo Buta to your right.   Atmosphere: great pictures on the wall and a cozy wood look/feel. However the water fill cart with cups, silverware, and a spray bottle for wiping down tables parked right across from our table made it feel a little unclean. It would be nice for them to move that to the back/behind the bar.   Appetizers:  * crispy rice squares were delicious. The tuna was fresh and paired well with the wasabi soy and the squares of fried white rice. Price: $12 * Smoked Pork Belly Buns: two soft buns with well sauced pork belly inside. Yummy. The buns are small so eat slowly. Price: $10  Sushi: we ordered a sushi roll that featured smoked salmon. My friend asked the waitress in advance how many pieces came with the sushi roll and she said 5. Not sure what happened to the 5th piece because it definitely came with 4! The plating was gorgeous but unfortunately, the taste was a no-go. It tasted fishy and the sauce had an unpleasant aftertaste. We returned this dish to the kitchen.   Ramen: all 3 of us ordered different bowls: Tonkotsu, Miso, and Fire & Ice. None of us had leftovers! These bowls are packed with noodles (I mean, really full) and had savory broths. The miso bowl (my order) had about 3 slices of pork belly and an egg along with the noodles/vegetables. My friend who ordered the Fire & Ice raved the most... I'm just not the biggest fan of kimchi.   Futo Buta is worth trying out. I doubt I'll ever be a regular, but I'm certain I will go back again. No appetizers, but will try another bowl!",

I was seated immediately at the bar closest to the kitchen. Both my server and the person I assume was the manager were helpful in volunteering their favorite dishes after discovering I hadn't been there before. I generally prefer tonkotsu so I ordered theirs. I have to say, it was quite good! There are two things keeping it from better than average rating. One: the prices. My favorite ramen shop in DC has bowls nearly twice as big as these for a dollar less. Two: there was a very disgruntled employee that kept trucking back and forth complaining about her tables when she'd grab food from the kitchen pass-through. It was weird, since she's nearly a foot away from other patrons. If I weren't there alone I probably wouldn't have noticed but it was a little uncomfortable. All in all if I were back in Charlotte, I'd visit again. If you're craving ramen, check it out!",

It's open seating (family style) but not family friendly. Don't be surprised if you're sitting right next to complete strangers.  If you have a large party, it's kind of inconvenient. I love the roll of paper they use to highlight their off-the menu menu as well as their beer specials. One TV... usually plays the big game of the night.   LOCATION South Boulevard off of Bland Street. Park in the apartment complex that it's part of. If you head towards the back of the parking lot, there are reserved spots for the restaurant.   FOOD  Pork Belly Buns. $10. Worth it. The pork belly is super tender but slightly crispy. The veggies on top offer a crunch and a much-needed vinegary element to cut the fattiness. Be forewarned... the buns.... there are only 2 of them. They are tiny.   Karaage Chicken. Worth it. The chicken is citrusy and comes with a spicy mayo sauce. The chicken is breaded very lightly.. Jonny described it as \"Japanese chicken nuggets\". The portions are small.   Miso Ramen. Worth it. The broth is delicious and thick. The noodles taste homemade. The slowly cooked egg is silky and adds to the overall earthiness of the dish. Add the local mushrooms... so worth it.   Tonkotsu Ramen. Sort of worth it. Very hearty. We preferred the miso ramen. Eat while it's hot... if you try to eat it slowly, the broth kind of \"coagulates\" and turns into a congealed mess.  Green tea soft serve. They don't always have it.. but if they do, get it.",

The four of us walked in and stood awkwardly inside the door for several minutes before we were acknowledged. We sat on the patio since the inside didn't have room for our small party.   Our server dropped off the menus in a rush. I was able to snag her to ask a few questions, mainly what she would recommend that's gluten free. She told me that \"all of the ramen dishes could be prepared GF, except for these two, and we recommend against ordering this one.\" That nixes half the ramen options. I asked \"do they come with rice noodles instead?\" She replied that they did and I settled on the Fire and Ice.  When our meals came out, each of my friends received a beautiful bowl of noodles while I got a bowl of broth and a separate bowl of rice. Just rice. Short grain sushi rice. And it was cold.   I paid $13 for a bowl of broth. Why would I bother to come back when I can get an excellent bowl of pho elsewhere for a fraction of the price? I don't know if it's bad communication with the kitchen, a non-interest in serving patrons with dietary restrictions, or what, but I feel like Futo Buta is another victim of the Charlotte hype machine.

Ramen broth is too oily and taste is really bland.  I couldn't even finish my small portion of ramen.  Presentation looks great but I don't think the owner had any authentic japanese ramen before.  Cozy environment, but pricey for their food.  Portion is way too small.    Great hangout spot, and great date night if you don't plan on eating a lot, because this place is loud and you have to seat close to each other in order to conduct a conversation.  Service is great, and therefore both service and environment deserve 2 stars.  May come back only for their soft serve ice cream cone.  Ramen?  Pass!",

The broth was everything you'd want from a nice, creamy, fatty pork broth and the noodles were perfect. Whatever the do to their pork belly had me going wild, because It was some of the best I've tasted. If you love ramen, please don't hesitate, GO! There's a little wait but it worth it.",

The soup was pretty standard and a lot like something I would make myself. For the pricing, I wasn't incredibly impressed and wish it was more authentic. Servings are small. Restaurant is small. Wait times too long. Nothing to write home about and not at all what you would expect when the entire concept is centered around ramen... more of a hipster place or for someone who likes the more Americanized version.   Hard to find / not on bland. By light rail tracks on a corner.",

They have an excellent sake selection, which also puts this place up towards the top of my list.",

Japanese fried chicken also taste good. I would like to try everything from Futo Buta!",

It was pretty crowded when I went at around 9pm on a Saturday but that is to be expected from a place this size and quality.  The shishito peppers are a good substitute for edamame(which they have) and the tori kara age dish has a great flavor.  The miso ramen is a great beginner's bowl in my opinion and the buta bowl is great but I recommend getting the spice on the side for those unfamiliar with spicy foods.  Aside from the extra small size of the place and the plethora of quirky octopus drawings in the bathrooms, this is a good spot to get some good food.",

The place was packed when we got there but we got our name in and were able to walk around the area for 20 minutes until we had a table ready.  We started off with the pork belly buns which I've been dying to try.  They were everything I hoped for!  The pillowy soft buns were evenly textured and delightfully fluffy.  The pork was full of flavor and juiciness, with burnt, crispy edges adding to the flavor and balancing it's tenderness.  Cabbage added a nice crunch and took off some of the heat from the sauce.  We split the Miso Hungry ramen (which is really not that easy to 'split' without making a mess).  The broth was flavorful but not too strong, allowing flavors from the other ingredients to really shine through.  I loved the sweet corn in there.  Gotta say the pork belly in this one was pretty skimpy.  In fact, I think all the additional ingredients were scant and wish there were more, but even when they are all gone the noodles are able to hold their own.  We finished with the soft serve, and got a twist of their two flavors of the night: Mango and Strawberry Banana.  I loved the presentation in the small cup with wooden spoons - reminiscent of Momofuku Milk Bar's soft serve! The soft serve was refreshing and light, but the flavors were very muted.  Couldn't really taste the banana, and the other flavors were also bland.  I was hoping to try the green tea flavor, but it wasn't available that day.    TLDR:  Get any ramen dish and the pork belly buns and you will be pleased.",

I also appreciate the pace of the restaurant as well, bowls typically come on in 5-7 minutes each time I've been making it pseudo-fast casual. The dining staff is really cool once you start talking to them, some of them can be a bit standoff-ish but it adds to the restaurants edginess, almost that \"too cool\" vibe but I love that. The quality of ingredients for me has been consistent every time! Pork belly is on point! Tuna Tartare Rice Krispy Treats are my weakness. I typically don't enjoy fish, but I can totally wrap my tastebuds around it! I suggest to everyone to go check this place out and appreciate it's unique dining experience, very few places on Charlotte express charm like Futo Buta and am glad that original restaurants are making an impact, especially having South End become so gentrified with franchises. Chef Shortino seems like an amazing guy and from what I've read about him and following him on instagram, you can really see his passion for food, which is me the most important. Read some of the bad reviews, and it seems as though people like to shit on the little things wrong and use there review to cause harm. I wanted to balance the one I saw on instagram today and say Fuck you to that person :)!  Keep killin it guys!  Kenny",

I was traveling alone and thought that a big bowl of ramen would be a great end to my work week (should I have just went with BBQ? I am in NC for god's sake). Anyway, I asked the host how long the wait was, and she said 10-15 minutes. I thought, \"No way in hell will I be seated in 10-15 minutes\", but then again, I was by myself, so figured there was a random seat that was going to open at the bar or something. So I agreed to wait. 50 minutes later my name was called! Seriously? Half my fault for believing her, but half her fault for telling me 10-15 minutes. So... I finally got my seat at the end of bar, ordered Brussel Sprouts and the Traditional Ramen. Sprouts were drenched in soy-like sauce, in a good way; they were delicious. Ramen came out pipping hot, with all the goodness of Ramen. It was a rich broth, so depending on what you like, Miso broth would be a lighter option. It's a small space, and due to the masses of people surrounding you, you do feel a little rushed. Food comes out very quickly, like they are just waiting for you to leave. But, service was good - friendly and attentive. Overall, the food was great. Would I wait 50 minutes, by myself, for this Ramen again, NO. But would I order take out, or come when its not so busy (not sure when that is), sure. Worth a stop if you want to wait, and or have a companion to chat with.",

They said once I eat here once I would be a repeat customer, and they were right. The presentation of the food, the service, just everything was great. This is not your average ramen noobles.

No, the food was edible, but I can also make edible food and I'm not the that good of a cook. It just wasn't good enough to where I'd come back again.  I paid $14 for a bowl of tonkotsu ramen that was average tasting at best and it didn't even really fill me up, but aesthetically it looked good. I'm not sure why other reviews said the broth is packed with flavor, but the broth I had was pretty bland (I've had packaged ramen that had more taste to it, granted it's probably filled with MSG). The ramen had like 2-3 thin slices of pork belly in it plus one egg. It's not worth the $14, you're paying to eat at a nice location basically. Way overpriced if you ask me.  The ambiance/decor was nice and the staff was very friendly and knowledgable, and that's really the only way they earned a 2.5 stars from me.",

    "text": "My husband and I are big fans of Futo Buta!  The restaurant is a bit hard to find if you are not familiar with this area.  And the address doesn't help one bit.  However, if you know where Crispy Crepe is, you can simply turn right down the side street next to CC, and park in the garage directly on the right.  Futo Buta is just past the parking garage, on the back corner facing the Lynx Bland Street stop.   In warmer weather, their seating doubles with lots of seating available outside.  We've sat both inside and outside, and prefer the spaciousness of outdoor seating.  Plus, it is fun sitting next to the Lynx platform!  We usually start with the crispy rice squares with spicy tuna.  This dish is creatively done and tastes AMAZING.  We have also had the pork/scallop gyoza (very good), and tofu skewers (a bit bland).    Being a seafood lover, I usually get the Fire and Ice ramen with smoked salmon and kimchi broth as my entree.  The broth is very flavorful and a nicely spicy.  The salmon is very tender, and has a delicious seasoning.    As many other reviewers have noted, Futo Buta is generous with the ramen noodles.  Being a huge noodle fan, that was just fine with me.  And they provide plenty of broth, too.  I loved this dish.  My husband has had both the Tonkotso and Miso (Hungry) ramen bowls.  For the latter, he added the spiced pork, and it was incredible.  Very spicy, too.  Honestly, I preferred his Miso over my dish.    If you have room for dessert, try their soft serve of the day.  Regardless of how odd the combinations may seem, they always taste delicious.    Service is really good at Futo Buta.  Everyone is so friendly and pleasant, and the food is usually brought out relatively quickly.  We'll definitely keep returning!",

I'll admit that I've only had one of the Ramen choices, the Tonkatsu, but don't know why I'd want to change up. It is so delicious and so consistent every time I come here. The Onsen Egg is the pieces de resistance!  The flavor is buttery and rich. I like to spice it up a bit and it is more than enough of a serving.   I've tried a couple of the appetizers and the Pork Belly buns and Tuna Tartare on Rice Crispies are awesome and tasty.    Don't leave without trying the ice cream!!

    "text": "Drove from D.C. to North Carolina to check out the mountains and animals in the forest. Everywhere I go, I like to check up on Ramen places because my taste buds and mind always work in conjunction to lure me into it. I am not a Ramen connoisseur by any means, but I have pretty much tried all of the Ramen joints in the D.C. area and wanted to check out a ramen place in Charlotte to see how it compares to what's local to me. After a quick glance on Yelp, we (My companion and I)  decided to check out this place.  It's tucked in an area along the city rail so it's a convenient stop if you're hungry! The place was packed both outside and inside, so that was a good sign! We went inside and was warmly greeted by the receptionist. There was a 15 minute wait, but luckily, they have a texting system so they will text you when a seat is available.  After having a seat, the friendly waitress took the order. I ordered the Tonkotsu and my companion orderd the Miso (Hungry) from the menu. I didn't get the joke at first! We also ordered the pork belly buns.  The pork belly buns literally came out within 2 minutes and they were beautifully presented. I took a bite and it literally, melted in my mouth and was orgasmic. When you have something melt in your mouth like warm butter, you know it's good for you (for your taste buds and mind. Not so sure about your heart, haha). That was the best pork belly buns I've ever had!  Now onto the Ramen. Again, they were beautifully presented. Very colorful, with each item (egg, red stuff, onions, etc...) separated into different sections. It looks like a colorful painting. Too pretty to eat, but I ate it anyways. It was one of the best Ramen that I've ever had! The broth was flavorful and not too strong and not too light. Perfect balance. Remember, Balance is the Heart of Everything! Like Yin Yang. Also, the portion was just right in terms of noodles to pork and the amount of food was just enough.  Totally recommended and worth the 6 hour drive to eat here. Yummers.",

    "text": "TL;DR - Incredible food. Oddly small portions. Insanely-high prices. No unsweet tea. Tips?  It's always a shame to me when a place with clearly stellar food gets outshined by other factors that just aren't thought out.  Futa Buto is a place with \"go out of your way\" food, perfect charm and a tucked-away location which make it a great place to grab some Asian comfort food any day you want to decompress.  The confusing part here is that once you taste the food (sans ramen), you're left wondering when the rest of it is coming. Tapas-size food is great, but it has to come to with tapas-size prices. Asking $10 for two pork buns the size of a credit card isn't reasonable to earn a return trip. However, if they were $6, I'd probably OD on these.  The wallet-zapping madness continues with $12 ramen bowls and $10 small plates. Somehow this place is listed as $$ but it's easily $$$ when you get a decent meal.  Then no unsweet tea (but having sweet tea) is so confusing I can't even wrap my head around it.  Finally, this is a place setup like Chipotle, but the staff is so great that they wander around and ask if you need anything, which makes the tip line on the check uncomfortably confusing. My solo lunch experiment to this wonderful eatery somehow ended up as a $32 lesson.  I wish I could say I'll be back, but I'll have to rob a trust fund first. The food is so good though, that hold on, I'll BRB.",

Futo Buta is located in the back of the South End Apartments literally right next to the light rail, boy...did we have a hard time figuring out where this place was..but it was worth it. We walked in around 5:40 since we saw all the great reviews for ramen (and we have been dying to find a good ramen place), there was no one there score! But the chef changed out the water for ramen which we were told would take a little more time than the norm, reverse score! We waited patiently for our Miso and Fire & Ice ramen bowels which came out around 6:15.. we weren't very amused with the wait but the server made up for it with a free ginger peach ice cream, so no hard feelings. The only complaint I have about the miso ramen was that it needed a little more salt in the broth..the fire and ice ramen was PERFECT. It was the right amount of savory and who thought salmon could work in ramen bowels... they earned the award for most creative today! I finished everything...I wish I didn't leave my phone in the car....I wanted to take pictures.. great presentation.   Suggestions for the Full Menu: need more chicken based ramen and a chicken bun..not everyone eats red meat.   Needless to say we will be back! Finally found good ramen in the Charlotte (possible North Carolina) area, my 3 month search since I moved has finally come to an end. Keep it up Futo Buta!",

It came with a good seasoned broth (not very spicy, but you are provided with siracha etc. to season to your taste), a piece of hot smoked salmon, and some veggies (they could up the amount a bit in my opinion). This is Japanese food slightly altered for American taste. Nevertheless, it's authentic enough to get a good flavour of Japanese ramen. Definitely recommend!",

    "text": "On a daily trip to Charlotte this was a great stop.  So what did this ramen gem offer us?  1) The staff was extremely friendly. They explained anything we asked and gave us ample warnings about cold ramen bowls. They even helped us match add ins for the flavor we were looking for.   2) The bathrooms were clean. This is very important.   3) The appetizers we had were very good. We ordered the rice crispy and fried chicken. I will warn you it is a lot of food so for two people I recommend you order one. The crispy rice cake comes with raw spicy tuna. Not your thing? The fried chicken is a yummy option. The lime really brought out the spicy flavor of the dipping sauce.  4) The ramen was fantastic. For 14 months I have been looking for a place that got the ramen close to what I had in Taiwan. I was looking for a spicy pork ramen. If that is what you crave come here. Order the Tonkatsu and add spicy ground pork and you get close to a spicy ramen you would find in Taiwan.   The Fire and Ice is what my boyfriend ordered. His broth was sweeter than mine by a lot. If you are looking for a fish based ramen, order the Fire and Ice.   The noodles in both bowls were cooked right. They had a pleasant chewiness to them, without being mush. The noodle to broth ratio was nice as well. Some places you go to the ratio is off and it will show. Here at Futo Buta that ratio is right.   5) The alcohol selection is nice. You have lots of choices between beer and sake. This is good because a lot of places only offer one or the other.   6) The environment is also welcoming. There is not a kids menu but they are welcome here. No one in this ramen place judged many be for the way they looked or who they were with. Why am I including this?  Because lately in some places I have seen this happening. I would like to thank Futo Buta for not judging anyone.",

For appetizers or a light snack I highly suggest fried miso tofu and the smoked pork l belly buns. If you want a cocktail and decide to opt out of sake get the futo fashion \"cherry bomb\". Finally, try the soft serve! Flavours change so be sure to ask! The fig cinnamon was great.",

I have had this restaurant on my radar for some time and decided to stop in for lunch during the work day. It was crowded as I predicted but seating was available at the bar so I took it. The menu looks delicious from start to finish. Offerings ranged from a pork belly ramen to sushi. I decided to try the dumpling app, sushi and ramen! I need to stop here and say that ALL of the food--including the food I saw come from the kitchen is both yelpable and instagramable lol. You want pictures of this food!  Back to the review- the dumplings were the Kuronuta Pork and Scallop Gyoza. They were flavorful and unique. For sushi I tried the Salmon Belly Nigiri. It was fresh, colorful and melt in your mouth good. For ramen I chose the Tonkotsu. The broth was bold and I especially enjoyed the organic black mushrooms.  Overall my experience was very positive. I will be back!",

I got the Buta Bowl; this the the ultimate big bowl with double the noodle, could also use a bit more veggies but I guess that's what the add-ons are for. The ramen isn't as chewy as other places which I like! The broth was semi-thick, I thought it was a bit oily but nonetheless tasted great. Not sure what's special about the on-egg but it wasn't anything special to me.   I realized Futo Buta means Fat Pig! What a great name. Love it.

Best to get them early in the season of when they grow because they seem less hot then. The food is local, the pottery is local, and the environment is super friendly but modern at the same time.

Second of all, the variety of toppings and delicious broths makes the ramen taste amazing! I am a big fan of the chizu ramen, which has cheese, egg, pesto and garlic. I add the spicy ground pork for an extra $2, which I think makes the dish even more flavorful!

But they did have high chairs for our kid. Long tables were prevalent and so was the bar seating. Uneven wooden panes in the table makes the dining all the more interesting.   Food -  We ordred the KUROBUTA PORK AND GOLDEN SCALLOP GYOZA. My wife says they were great. They tasted like any other fried dumplings I've had.   As for the Ramen, I ordered the Miso (they were out of the fire and ice) and my wife had the Tonkotsu. Both dishes were good. And my kid ate both dishes. He tends to like noodles. We came from St Louis and the year before we left, they opened up a Ramen restaurant near out place. It was okay. But Futo Buta was great. The broth was flavorful, and the noodles were great.   Staff -  Seems like they have quite a bit of staff for such a small space. So they were on top of everything. Friendly and knowledgeable.   We would come back again.",

Futo Buta is one of a very, very small number of restaurants in CLT serving decent Asian food. Compared to any good ramen place in more established metropolitan areas, Futo Buta could not be mentioned in the same breath; however, in Charlotte, this is clearly one of your best options. We had the pork belly buns (2 for $10) which were very good but tiny for the price. Tonkatsu ramen ($14) and Shoyu ramen ($12) were semi-flavorful and easily the best in town. It's not that Futo Buta is so great; it's just that the rest of what Charlotte has to offer is so bad. However, here's hoping the bar is being raised for what constitutes acceptable Asian cuisine.  If any Asian-inclined chefs are looking for a market with little competition, Charlotte is still wide, wide open.",

    "text": "First of all, I love ramen!!! I've been eaten ramen for 20+ years, and had really authentic ramen in Japan.  I've been to Futo Buta twice. 4 star for food, 2 for experience.  Food - I have tried Tonkotsu, Miso with added Spicy Pork, Fire&Ice, and Hiyashi. They are all decent, but then again I like ramen in general. Tonkotsu and Miso soup base are a bit over salty. Salmon in Fire&Ice was better than I expected. I would come back just because there is limited options for ramen in Charlotte. If this place was in LA, I probably would come back only for convenience.  Waiter - For the second visit, the waiter who led us to the table was very rude. We had 5, and he insisted we either sit at a 4-person table, or wait for another table to finish. There were 2 4-person tables available next to each other, and this was at 3pm on Monday, so the restaurant was not busy. We took the 4-person table thinking it would work, since 1 of us was a child. However, the table was made up of two separate pieces, so there was a big gap in the middle, and 1 person couldn't fit comfortably without having to awkwardly lean over to one side. So we asked the waiter if we could split into a table of 3, and a table of 2, and just occupy both the 4-person tables. Wow, did we get scolded as if we were little kids. He insisted we need to wait for another table to finish if we can't all fit in the 4-person table. We were too hungry to wait, so had to awkwardly eat our ramen. Even after we finished, the table we supposedly had to wait for was still not finished, and they decided to seat a party of 2 at the 4-person table we wanted to occupy, while other 2-seats remained open at the restaurant.",

We ordered the Gyoza - it was amazing. Then we got the low country pork belly buns, oh my gosh these were amazing! and then we ordered the miso ramen and the shoe ramen. If you like your ramen spicy add the chili sauce, it's very hot but VERY good. We both agreed that it's been a long time since we went out and everything we ordered was phenomenal and not just good.

Stephanie, our waitress, and Mike, the manager, could not have been more accommodating, helpful, and all around awesome to us. They both thoroughly explained what my wife could eat, what they could change, and provided some solid recommendations. We began with the Japanese fried chicken (which is gluten free as they use corn starch) as an app. My wife ordered Chizu which was accommodated for her with rice on the side instead of noodles. She loved it. I (not GF) had the fire and ice. We both loved every bite of our food. Our good friend had the Miso and he raved about it. In the past I've greatly enjoyed the Tonkotsu (the more \"traidiontal\" bowl) along with their pork and duck buns. I've yet to not enjoy something from here. The drink section is great and they are (I believe) the only place in the area with Genshu. I've been here before and had a great meal, but tonight was above and beyond thanks to Stephanie and Mike's amazing service and help. Thank you!",

I had heard about this place from friends for so long and always puzzled I had not encountered it while driving etc. When I did find it during a walking trip to another location I could not contain my enthusiasm. I ate outside in their nice quaint patio area next to the Lynx line. The ramen here is nothing short of fantastic and the restaurant possesses a nice varied menu that makes it certain I will be back again. The friendly wait staff sealed the deal. Seek this place out for one of the best meals you will have in Charlotte.",

    "text": "After a bit of searching, I did find Futo Buta. It is at the south end of the light rail station, on the side closest to South Blvd. Inside, a nice lay out with high top and low top tables. Most of the seating is stools that have no backs. This is nice for 15 or 20 minutes but after a half hour, it's going to be uncomfortable. On a nice day, the outside chairs might be more comfy.  On to the main event, the ramen. I went right to the top of the menu, the Tonkotsu. A ton of different individual flavors and textures in this large bowl of pork broth and of course, a big serving of ramen noodles underneath the surface. Very tasty, a little messy, well worth it.  While they do have a good selection of beers and several other drinks in the cooler, water is a good idea for all the sodium you'll be enjoying.  You will want to wear something in a dark solid color or with lots of colors on it. This stuff does splash.  Parking. Well, I found a metered spot on the street. But there is also a parking deck with a few free hours next door too. Oops.",

We then shared the seasonal pho- butternut squash. While it was fun to try something new and seasonal, I was a little sad to not be spooning in the standard egg and other pho tastes. Definitely recommend the seasonal still as it got me out of my comfort zone and was delicious  The server was sweet but a little behind- she definitely forgot our takeout request, but really hustled and gave great suggestions.   Great place with a good atmosphere and lovely food. Go here!",

    "text": "Being new in town, our trip to this restaurant was our first time spent in south end. It's nestled in a corner retail space along the light rail tracks, accessible only by parking on the other side of one of the buildings and walking towards the blue line stop. I really loved the pedestrian only area along the rail trail which is surrounded by several restaurants and bars.   We ordered the miso (hungry) and the fire and ice ramen bowls. Coming from Portland, OR I have a somewhat limited experience with \"authentic\" ramen, but I did have a few favorite places out there that I went to often. I can't verify how authentic this place was or not, but I can say that we did both enjoy what we got.   The miso had a rich and fatty broth which was not overly seasoned as I sometimes find at other places. The pork belly was seared before being added to the soup, giving it a delicious charred flavor and a soft fatty texture. It was basically like thick sliced bacon cooked in a pan. The vegetables were a welcome and refreshing balance to the fattiness of the soup. The noodles had a great texture and I hear they're made in house from local ingredients.   We were fairly full afterwards so we decided to split one portion of soft serve. That day they had apricot with a chocolate drizzle. We both thought it was quite good and a nice way to cool down after eating a bowl of hot soup on a hot summer day. It had a nice smooth texture and wasn't overly sweet like some fresh ice creams can be.   As I hear this is basically the only specialty ramen place in the city I'm sure I'll be back soon for more!",

    "text": "Finally got to try Futo Buta for lunch with a some friends as its been on my bucket list ever since a few of my Yelp friends checked the place out.  The restaurant is on the first floor of the Post apartment complex and faces the inbound lane of the Lynx blue line right at the the Bland Street station.  Three hour complementary parking is available at the bottom level of the apartment complex.  The restaurant is tiny so it might be best to come on off hours to get a seat.  There a long bar, a long pub table and a few regular tables inside and that's it.  They do have a large patio that may actually have more seating than inside the restaurant.    Before you order from the menu, check out the fresh list on the wall in the main dining area for the daily specials. My friends ordered an appetizer off of that list that was absolutely amazing. I think it was tuna in a spicy sauce.  My order consisted of the fried brussels sprouts for an appetizer and the Fire and Ice entry.  The brussels sprouts were great but the tuna app was better!  Fire and Ice was just amazing. Ramen with smoked salmon and fresh veggies. It had a nice kick to it as well.  For dessert, they make their own ice cream and the flavor changes daily. Today's flavor was strawberry basil and it was quite tasty and very refreshing on a hot day.  I think this will become a regular lunch spot for me.",

    "text": "Charlotte has always had a kind of ramen-bowl shaped void in it. Sure, there's a few places that offer it on the menu. But finally, we have a ramen house!   I love what Chef Michael is doing here. The menu is authentic, but not traditional Japanese.  All the noodles here are made from scratch in house using hard red winter wheat from Lindley Mills, NC. We love local/regional!   From the Izakaya (small plate) menu, I've had the Pork and Scallop Gyoza, the Rice Crispy Squares, and the Low Country Smoked Pork Belly. They're all good. For me, the Rice Crispy Squares are the must-order app. Not only is it a gorgeous plate, but the combination of the spicy tuna, crispy square, and sauce is just fantastic. If you don't like raw tuna, don't get this dish. Note on the buns, they come two to an order.   My favorite ramen bowl here is the Fire and Ice. I love the flavors of the kimchi broth and the smoked salmon. I've had both the Tonkotsu and the Miso (hungry). They're both good, but for me I think the Fire and Ice has the best broth. I always ask the server to bring me some spice to add to my bowl. The F&I doesn't come with an egg, but my friend Tom doesn't like them so I always get his. Score.   Make sure you check the Fresh Sheet posted inside on the wall to see all the special offerings of the day. The hamachi crudo is perfection. They also do a different ice cream flavor daily. Be sure to ask your server. Coke comes in a glass bottle. Sorry Diet Coke fans, you get a can. Muahahah (that's my evil laugh).  Everyone is really nice here, but the service tends to be on the slower side. Not a huge deal breaker or anything, just know that going into it. I always sit outside because I like to people watch along the light rail.  Location: your GPS may get confused. It's behind Crispy Crepe on South Blvd. Turn there and you can park on the first floor of the deck behind Crispy Crepe. Futo Buta is then located on the corner on the back side of the parking deck. It's right there on the Bland Street light rail station.",

If you don't know where it is you turn on Rensselaer Ave (Or at Crispy Crepe if you are spatially inclined person like me). You can park for up to 3 hours at the Post Southend Parking garage at the end of the road. Futo Buta is straight toward the light rail from there.   The restaurant was very crowded when we arrived and we decided to sit at the bar instead of battling the intense summer heat. This is where they lost me a little bit - the chairs are so close together there is no hope in edging around and sitting in your seat. You must pull the stool all the way out and then awkwardly scoot it up once you have gotten near the bar.   The service at the bar was phenomenal. Our waiter was extremely friendly and kept our water glasses full and checked on our food and gave us suggestions. I ordered the tuna tataki to start. I wish they had this item on their regular menu and not just a featured special. It was a truly amazing and expertly seared tuna with a delicious sauce. The man ordered the pork buns which were good but were eclipsed by the tuna.   The main event of the visit unfortunately did not deliver as hoped. In the interest of full disclosure my experience with ramen has been the high MSG pseudo-filling packets you can get for a few cents from your local Walmart. The ramen noodles served at Futo Buta were completely different to those sad little packages so frequently eaten by college students. The broth however was bland and would have been better sans ginger slices. The pork in the broth was super tender but also rather fatty. The bowl was very filling and I took about half of it home.   I will probably go again when it cools down enough to sit outside, but at over $20 for a small plate and ramen I doubt I will become a regular.",

    "text": "I ate my husband's leftovers from here for lunch today so while its fresh on my mind...review time! I was trying to wait until cooler Fall temps before once again slurping on a bowl of piping hot ramen but I could not.  Ive always had to wait, albeit, the wait really doesn't take long. If you have to wait for a seat and its raining or very cold, know you might have to wait outside since the \"waiting area\" is not big, but that is because the restaurant really isnt big either. There are rows of seats by the window as well as a larger communal type table in the middle. My husband and I sat at two seats across from each other at that big table. Food comes out fast. When in season, we always get the shishito peppers to start. Not many restaurants have them so we partake in their deliciousness when we get the chance.  This visit, I opted for the Chizu ramen which I have had before. Its chicken broth with grated pecorino cheese piled to one side of the bowl so you can stir it around once the large bowl is placed in front of you. I add shrooms for extra extra umami and it never disappoints. Not your typical ramen though. My husband got the vegan one which has some serious flavor going on too. This own is the Niwa. We will be getting the rice crispy squares next time. This app comes with blocks of crisped rice, nice and browned. Then its served with spicy tuna and some soy and you assemble what you want in one bite.",

YOU'RE NOT A DANCE CLUB, SO  TURN THE MUSIC DOWN ITS ANNOYING WHILE EATING!!!!!!!!! FIRST....there were several tables available and for anyone that has been there you know its a very small place, so this is a good thing! The waiter didn't seat us quickly because they had to check with the manager on where we could sit. WTH?  3 tables left and you had to ask manager where to sit us?!  We were with someone that was not able to sit at the high bar stools due to just having major back surgery, so we needed a table with normal chairs.....as there was 3 tables free (equaled about 14 empty seats). We did tell the waiter this, but that didn't seem to register at all. When we finally told them again.... NO , we cannot sit at the bar on the high bar stools due to our friend who is temporarily handicap they finally let us sit at one of the many open tables.  Still have no idea why they didn't seat us at a table first, since the other tables sat there empty for at least another 20 minutes before anyone came in to eat.  SECOND, waitress was didn't even smile or say hello when she approached us. RUDE!!!!! She didn't tell us anything about the food or place, just went straight to taking our food order and NEVER asked for our drink order and she disappeared until the food was ready. THIRD  the music was so loud that we couldn't even hear our waitress speak and when we kept asking her to repeat she got very annoyed with us.  We sat through our entire dinner not saying a word, because the music was so loud. We are not old peeps and this still bothered us, so I can't imagine someone that is older that isn't use to loud music. Unfortunately, won't be returning until they get some common sense on ambiance and friendlier staff.",

    "text": "Finally, a restaurant dedicated to ramen in Charlotte.  At this point the ramen fad is in full effect nationwide.  Most bigger cities have at least one or more ramen restaurants where hordes of hipsters can satisfy their noodle cravings.  Now Charlotte has its own and it delivers (figuratively, not literally......but here's hoping).  The menu is simple: apps, buns, noodles .  All are done very well.  Under the apps, the fried brussel sprouts are amazing as is the tori kara age, which is a Japanese fried chicken.  The buns are a take on dim sum style steamed buns that have a variety of fillings.  All of them are excellent.  And lastly, the noodles.  The first time I went, the waiter recommended the miso flavored ramen and to add the spicy ground pork.  It is so good that we have been back three times, and I cannot order anything different.  Great food, reasonable prices, and a fun atmosphere make Futo Buto one of Charlotte's most enjoyable dining experiences.",

We were a two top that was greeted at the same time as the five top beside us was being sat. We ordered our app (tuna tartar with flash fried rice) at the first greet. The table beside us got bar drinks and their entrees way before we got our appetizer. When it finally came out it was great, but our ramen came out while we were taking our first bites. We had an overcrowded table, ramen getting cold, and were just ready to leave at that point.  We basically just packed the ramen and went home. I totally understand that these things happen but nothing was offered to remedy the situation, server did not seem to pick up the fact that we weren't happy, no manager ever came by the table to see how things were going.  Overall service was just lacking.",

I've tried the tonkatsu (my personal favorite) and the shoyu. Both are fantastic, however, I'd ask to skip the sliced ginger on my bowl. Its a little strong. Despite that tiny personal preference, I will not deduct points. Why? The broth is superb, the pork is succulent, and give me two orders of the pork buns because I can never get enough. You're in luck. I'm even going to give you advice on what to drink. They serve alcohol but I love their fresh strawberry lemonade. Its crisp, slightly bitter (how I like it) and full of potent strawberry awesomeness. Lastly, don't forget dessert. Their ice cream is phenomenal. Get some!",

    "text": "New spot in Charlotte! Since I had some friends from out of town who wanted to try it, we decided to come here after a whim. Location was confusing and hidden. The GPS took us to the other side of the light rail since it wasn't visible to us while driving (maybe if you're taking the light rail you might see it). No parking next to the restaurant, so we walked around until I had to ask bystanders where this location was at.   Side note: I've had many friends told me this place was terrible but I didn't want to take their words for it.  Gotta try it out for yourself before you make your own decision right? Well, maybe I should of listen to them after all.   So we started off with some hamachi sashimi slices and they weren't bad. Had a very sour taste to it but overall decent if they could tone down that sourness. Pork bellies bun were \"Americanized\" flavor of sweet bbq sauce, not much punch or flavors to it. Definitely not impressed.   As for the ramen, we all opted to try the Tonkatsu Ramen because how can you failed in something that's normally good at other ramen places?  We all took one bite and went looking for the salt. The broth was so bland. No salt were to be found. So when the waitress came to check on us, I requested something salty to add to the broth. She brought out some condiments and we all dose ourselves with what looks like Japanese \"salt seasoning\". Even with that, it left a weird after-taste. Usually when creating the broth for ramen, the broth has to be cooked for hours to create a sweet flavorful broth. However,    after attempting 5 bites of this bowl, we all quickly agreed that even with the store bought Ramen packages - it would probably tasted even better than this!  My friend took two more bites & eventually gave up, stating she can't eat this anymore. \"It's just not good\", she said. I didn't want to waste foods so I attempted to finish it but eventually gave in when our  other friend said she's also done. Basically we all didn't even finished our meals and asked for the check and left.  We ended up driving to Rusan's instead.   Service was awesome btw. Our waitress was great. Very cute setting but limited seatings. Foods, however were mediocre.  I should of listen to all my Asian friends who said this place doesn't hold up to its hype. Hey, at least we gave it a try. Please do some more researches on how real Ramen broth or legit ramen restaurants i.e from Los Angeles or maybe Japan themselves before opening a restaurant in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Futo Buta doesn't take reservations, so expect a short wait if you have a larger party in the evenings (even on the weekdays, it seems).  My colleagues and I (group of 5) waited around 15 minutes for a table on a Wednesday evening and eventually decided to squish into a 4-person table rather than have to sit at the bar... awkward for conversation.  If you're lost, Futo Buta is located on the corner on the light rail side, making it easily accessible off the Bland light rail stop.  Atmosphere is similar to an izakaya, if you've ever been to one.  Very casual and semi-loud.   For a ramen joint in Charlotte, I wasn't expecting much.  Reigning from NYC, I've had my share of decent ramen.  I was surprised that the ramen at Futo Buta is actually not bad at all - I prefer my places in NYC, but this will do while I'm traveling.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and added the chili to make it spicy (extra $1) - spicy it was.  I order the same thing at every ramen place, thus being able to make somewhat of a comparison among the different ramens I've had.  They serve the curly kind of ramen noodles here, versus the thinner kind, which I prefer.  Regardless, the pork bone broth was flavorful and the spicy sauce added a huge kick - warning for those that might not like that high of a spice level.  I was really impressed with the pork (char siu) here - it was just the right amount of fat-to-meat ratio and was marinated really well in a semi-sweet sauce and charred to perfect.  Probably some of the best meat I've had in ramen, actually!  The ramen here also comes with a poached egg.  At $14, the amount of food you get is reasonable.  In addition to the ramen, I also ordered the uni (sea urchin) nigiri (2 pieces, $7).  The uni was decently fresh (I haven't gotten sick) and I actually enjoyed this as an appetizer.  The salted radish was crunchy and refreshing.  I think this was supposed to come with some watermelon of some sort, but I don't recall seeing it.  Service is decent.  Worth a shot if you're in the area.  I don't know if there's any other comparable restaurants that serve ramen nearby.",

I recently stopped in for lunch and tried the Miso ramen bowl, which includes corn, pork belly, scallions, bean sprouts, bok choy, minus the onsen egg.  I'm still trying to figure out why I paid $12 for that....nothing about this ramen stood out, the pork belly was ok, but the noodles and broth in my opinion were no different from what's sold in the grocery store.  The veggie toppings were fresh but nothing about this ramen was special for me, just seems a tad overrated.",

Since Futo Buta is right on the Light Rail, there isn't a lot of parking right beside it (basically street parking). We arrived around 6 and there wasn't a wait (however, when we left, there definitely was people waiting outside). The space is fairly small but cutely (is that a word??) set up. They have a very long high top table as well.  We started with the Saki flight, as we don't drink Saki a lot and thought this was a great way to taste a few. The flight was neat because they brought out little information cards on each of the sakes that came in the flight. Awesome idea if you don't know what to drink off the bat!  We started with the pork belly buns and the rice crispy tuna. The buns were tasty and traditional soft dough buns. Two came with the appetizer and they were nice sized with a decent piece of pork belly inside. The Rice Crispy Tuna was so delish!!! I loved that some assembly was required, as it made it a bit more fun. The crispy rice was something I have never had before and so different. The tuna was super flavorful. We decided to split the Fire and Ice as a main. The mint and salmon combined so well in this delish. Definitely a winner!  Can't wait to come back and try some of their sushi!",

The restaurant is small but cozy. It's well thought out with nice details for service (napkins, chopsticks are all upper end of the consumables scale)  They do a good job in their raw items, as they try to serve fresh uni and such when it's available and do a relatively good job at it. Their rice bowl starters are pretty good but my favorite of all the starters is their spicy tuna rice crispy. As for the ramen itself, I'm a big fan of the Tonkotsu with an extra side of spicy pork. The ramen is rich in flavor and well executed.   Now, as for the reason I'm only giving them four stars and not five: value. The pricing is a little steep for what you are getting. There are plenty of other ramen places that serve as good or better ramen, but unfortunately they are not in Charlotte. I feel sometimes they skimp on product and you never want to feel that way in a restaurant. Nevertheless, the food is good and the pricing doesn't bother me enough to not go because it's the only place to get some good ramen around.",

Definitely sit outside if a table is open. It's a great atmosphere and inside is mostly backless stools and can be a little loud.  Be sure you check out the funky bathrooms.   Get a couple appetizers for the table to start.   We had the pulled pork buns and the duck confet buns which were so fresh and outstandingly flavorful.   Our table also split the \"rice crispy treats\" which are small blocks on deep fried sticky rice served with a soy ginger sauce to dip and fresh raw tuna to top it with,  really fascistic.   The ramen is of course the showcase and there is something for every taste from the simple noodles in a chicken broth to the giant Buddha bowl that is a mixture of every protein and noodles.   Also check out the seasonal cold noodles as well,  they're a nice change.   They lost a star from me simply because the menu is pretty limited so if you have a picky eater in your group they might be a little challenged.   But,  then again,  ramen is pretty universal so they should be ok.",

We waited for almost 45mins for our ramen a to arrive  2. Tonkotsu ramen's broth was too greasy and bland for me. Not much flavor either.   The second time we were happy because we picked the right stuff: 1. Miso hungry ramen: adding miso and spice makes the bland broth much more flavorful. Even tho it's still have some room for improvement, I was generally quite satisfied with this ramen. The spicy pork that I added was really good!   2. Ice and fire: much clear but still flavorful broth. Mint balanced out the grease in the broth.  3. Pork belly buns: I am a fan! You should get this no doubt!",

As the night progressed, our wait went from 17 to 11, then back to 13 eventually to the hostess completely forgetting about us. We approached the hostess and she decided to give the spot of 4 to another group because she decided for us it wasn't good for us. When approached about why this happened, she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"sorry.\"  After we were finally sat, we noticed another family of 3 had patiently waiting for a very long time and they were ignored too while tables of 3 were given to more recent guests.   This experience has left a bad taste and would not recommend this spot till they have better organized hostess.",

Let me start off and say that my husband has spent a lot of time in Japan (and had his fair share of Japanese Ramen dishes), and he also absolutely loves this place. The flavor of the Miso is very authentic (with the added bonus of the pork!) The pork buns are also amazing (small and pricey, but worth it for sure). I haven't tried any other of their dishes (other than another ramen dish that was a special of the day), so I cannot comment on those, but I have heard good things about them.  There can be a wait (sign of good food!) at times, but if you go early enough, you should beat the crowd. Street parking is the best, and cheapest option, if you don't live nearby. (there is no parking lot for it)  The portions are large (in my opinion), and make for great leftovers! It is a little bit $, but it is definitely worth it!",

Our other two guests were on their way, but we were told we had to wait to be seated until our entire party arrived. It was 11:30 a.m. and there was not a single guest sitting on the patio. Still, the hosts told us that we could review the menu while standing and waiting for our guests. Comical. And rude. Apparently, it is the restaurant's policy that guests are not allowed to be seated until the whole party has arrived. I understand that, but the patio was completely open. Use some common courtesy (and common sense!) rather than following arbitrary rules!  I told them we would happily take our business elsewhere and they seemed unfazed and were quite rude. So, not only will I never take my business here, I will make an effort to steer as many people away from this establishment as possible. My friends and I ended up eating outside at Leroy Fox, and it was great! Highly recommend that restaurant.",

    "text": "When I first saw the excellent reviews for Futo Buta, I was a bit skeptical given the lack of ramen restaurants in Charlotte... but this place is the real deal! The quality here really is what you might expect from a ramen joint in California or New York.  I've tried the Tonkotsu, Miso, and Shoyu here and enjoyed every single of them. The broth tends to be on the richer side but it is most definitely flavorful so no complaints from me here. I've also found the pork belly to be \"melt in your mouth\"-delicious and tend to order an extra onsen egg.  Outside of the ramen (though one bowl of ramen alone will probably fill you up), the pork belly buns are also a solid option, just a tad pricey at $10 a serving. The fried brussel sprouts and gyoza are good appetizer options, which may come in handy as service can sometimes be a bit slow.  The restaurant itself is small and often packed, so I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group. However, the ambiance here is quite cool and the food is tasty, so I would say it's worth the wait!",

He went when Futo was first open. Of course I'm sure at that time, they're trying to work out their kinks.. so he decided to give Futo a 2nd chance and I'm glad he did.  Step into a place which jammed pack and cozy. We promptly seated. Tyler introduced himself pleasantly.. I mentioned that my friend came here when it was first open and he wasn't impressed. I on the other hand will just order the same old thing like i usually do which is the Miso Hungry (habit for me). Tyler asked my friend if he's willing to trust him., and if he like heat in his ramen. The response. Yea with the heat but it has to be flavorful heat. Not just heat thrown in there! Understandable. His ramen was even listed. Perfect.  Ramen has a chicken dashi broth, spiced ground pork, duck confit and pickled daikon. And he loves it. Tyler made him a fan now. And I'm truly impressed. We will now come back and he will alway ask him for something off the menu from now on!",

    "text": "Gah, I so wanted to fall in love with Futo Buta. Having eaten various regional styles of ramen in Japan I was so excited about its potential. It took me ages to finally try it, nervous this place, like many other asian spots in Charlotte before it, would let me down. Unfortunately it did just that. So I gave it another chance, ordering other things, still....nah.    Tonkotsu ramen when done right is one of the best foods out there. Hot, rich, creamy, meaty broth with an incredible depth of flavor. I never would bother ordering miso or shoyu as those are too easy. Tonkotsu broth, however,  takes hours upon hours to develop the right flavor. So on my first visit, I felt the best way to test their ramen making skills was to start with the piece de resistance of Japanese ramen.     Before I get to the ramen, we started with an order of the brussel sprouts and the karaage (fried chicken). The brussels were horribly under seasoned. The karaage was more like popcorn chicken bits and would have fared better with the traditional accompaniments (i.e salt, lemon, mayo) than the so-so runny dipping sauce it came with. Not bad but it had me wishing for the real thing. Alright now for the ramen. It came out looking beautiful. All the usual garnishes were there and THEN some. I tasted one spoonful of the broth and my heart sank a little bit. The right flavors were there, but dialed WAAAAAAYYYY down. As if the broth hadn't been cooked long enough, or they watered it down to get more servings out of it. What a shame. The pork however was absolutely delicious. The onsen egg was a nice idea but soft boiled eggs fare better in tonkotsu broth, so I missed that texture in there. The noodles, while I appreciate that they make them in house, are cooked too long, lacking a slight chew that one looks for in a ramen noodle. I cannot say on any level that the ramen was terrible. It just wasn't right. If you have never had the real thing before, I can see how this would still be delicious. But if you have a point of reference its rather disappointing. Especially considering the bill. To avoid being a complete negative Nancy I will say that the avocado soft serve was really tasty, if I lived in this neighborhood I would be dropping in or this in the summer on the regs, and they do have a really nice pot of green tea.     Since my friends adore this place they once again invited me for a meal there. I accepted with hesitation but figured it wouldn't be right for me to write off a place after one visit. I decide I would go again and try other things off the menu. This time around I ordered the pork belly buns and the tuna donburi. The pork belly buns were pretty good, but I suppose I was expecting pieces of pork like what comes in the ramen, but instead of melt in your mouth succulence it was quite dry and chewy. A little over sauced too, since gochujang has a tendency to be overpowering. But it was a decent size for the price I would say. Now the tuna donburi, while appealing to the eye, was pretty bad. The tuna was super fishy tasting (seconded by my friend who tried what I no longer had interest in eating), made worse by the pulverized texture of the tuna. No amount of soy sauce could help with the flavor. I had a few bites and couldn't stomach any more.I did try a spoonful of my friends shoyu ramen and it was rather tasty, far more flavor than the tonkotsu broth (which is also tried again..same verdict).     As for service, the waitress we have had both times is very friendly and peppy, However one can't help but notice the other waitress' attitude dropping off or picking up plates as well as her interaction with other patrons. Its as if she came to work immediately finding out her dog died or something. She has a miserable expression on her face, slams down plates and rolls her eyes. Not sure why she has a job dealing with people as she seems to loathe them.   To wrap up this epically long review....I don't really get the hype. Perhaps very few people in Charlotte have had the real thing, or perhaps they do as my friends do which is add in every hot sauce and condiment until you can't even taste what was in there in the first place. But even still the taste of that tuna was universally inexcusable. I will say that the tunes they play in here are really quite brilliant but there is a still an authentic ramen void in my heart, right along side authentic Korean food and a place like The Steeple. Bummer.",

If you are using google maps to find this location, you might be a little lost since it leads you to a random building. Since the store front does not face the street, I would find any street or garage parking and walk towards the train tracks. which should lead you to the restaurant.

Everything was going wonderfully, we finished lunch, ordered dessert and after a short time , the waitress asked us to leave as someone was waiting for our table. Inside the restaurant were many available seats. We were enjoying the beautiful day by sitting outside. Unexpectedly the manager visited our table, interrupted our conversation to tell us our time was up and we had to vacate our table because other people wanted to sit there. The Manager said we only have 15 minutes from the time we finish our meal to get out! HOW VERY RUDE!!!! With other ramen noodle bars opening in Charlotte, the Manager should mind his P's and Q's!!  Unfortunately we won't be back. Ever. Thank you ruining our day.",

    "text": "I visited Futo Buta on a Tuesday afternoon (~6:30) with a couple of friends. The restaurant is relatively small (it probably seats around 40 or fewer), so it took a fair bit of time to be seated (but nothing preposterous). You can check your place in line on a website, which comes in handy if you're interested in going elsewhere for drinks while waiting.  We started with the smoked pork belly buns, which I would highly recommend! One order (two buns) is enough for a party of two, but odd-numbered parties should consider ordering an additional plate. These aren't the best buns I've had (Momofuku CCDC in Washington, DC comes to mind, although nostalgia has a way of sweetening the past), but I found them quite tasty nonetheless.  I ordered the fire and ice ramen as my entree. I'll admit that, prior to actually tasting the dish, I had my reservations about using salmon as the \"meaty\" base for the ramen. I can now say, however, that the dish was exceptionally well-done. The kimchi and salmon paired wonderfully! I also tasted the miso and shoyu ramens--if you're looking for something to blow you away, these aren't your dishes, although they were nonetheless well-made.  All in all, the service was forgettable, and I would have preferred more engagement and direction from the waitress while ordering (there are few things worse than someone who green lights every option on the menu), but it more or less met my expectations considering the locale and time of day.",

The restaurant is on the right...you can't miss it.  We had four people on a Wednesday at 6 pm.  The place was busy and we had a small wait.  We were seated \"communal style\" beside other people at the large table in the middle.  You can get your own table if you get there early.  Three of us ordered the Miso Ramen and we all loved it!  The pork belly and egg is something special.  The other person in our group got small plates (Gyoza and pork belly and duck steam buns) and they all looked great.    The food came out quick and the service was spot on.  We will go back...SOON!",

    "text": "Only star deduction because of the \"waiting\" line set-up. Went there during lunch and it gets crowded. It feels especially crowded when you enter and there are people standing there waiting to be seated. Not much room to spread out. Either you felt you were going to almost sit at people waiting for take-out or diners at the counters. Back-up a bit more and you are at the kitchen. Customers waiting to be seated didn't know where to line up or put their names down for the wait. Perhaps they can have a \"hostess podium\" outside before you even enter the space. Would help with crowding at the entrance and not make it awkward when patrons are trying to get out of the restaurant.  FOOD! ok, now to the important part. Had the rice crispy squares as appetizers. DEF. WOW! yes, i know how to make spicy tuna poke at home, but how do I get my rice to stay square and crisp without burning them dry? I highly recommend this as an appetizer. My coworker who I went with had the Tori Kara Age (crispy chicken) these were good too, I was expecting something like bonchon, but these were boneless pieces, with a sweet glaze and a spicy chili dip! very good too.  We sat outside - it was a bit chilly, but nice in the sun and we planned on having ramen anyways and it would keep us warm. We both had the Tonkotsu ramen and it was delicious. Arranged nicely, served not too hot you burn yourself. Noodles tasted freshly made and the pork belly was done right. I wasn't able to finish my soup because of the appetizer. Being new to Charlotte, this will def. be my go to ramen place as it's just down the block from my office!  Because it was a bit chilly, I didn't get to try their deserts. Next time for sure! I want that soft serve.  Staff was friendly and quick. Just a little confused on how to seat the incoming lunch crowd. Would be nice if they communicated \"pick-ups here, people waiting to be seated here, people to put name on list here\" again as noted in my intro, if people can be caught before entering the small indoor waiting area, by having a podium outside. Perfect crowd control solution!",

Our bartender/waitperson had great knowledge of the menu, was fun to talk with, and always there when we needed anything.  Excellent sake and drink special.  The ono hot sauce is definitely HOT, beware, but it is also beautifully complex. The egg was perfectly done. The brussel sprouts, kara age and roll special were all well made.

Located just steps away from the Bland light rail station, this is a fabulous little Japanese spot is a great addition to the South End restaurant scene. With a spacious patio right on the Rail Trail, a great selection of local craft beers and sake, and incredible ramen dishes, Futo Buta is the real deal. I enjoyed the outstanding Miso Ramen bowl, loaded with smoked pork, corn and cabbage, which paired perfectly with a local craft brew. They also serve sushi and other Japanese dishes, which I fully intend to dive into during my next visit. Highly recommended.",

Bright, fun green plastic chairs make for a quieter experience instead of hearing metal dragging across the cement like most places. The planters create a little nook, and the tables are perfectly spaced apart so you don't feel on top of other diners.  My waiter was so kind due to my friend getting lost for over 20 minutes. He didn't make me feel bad about waiting so long and checked on me. When she did arrive we ordered 2 ramen bowls with pork belly, a soft boiled egg, and lots of other goodies. It was perfectly hot, incredibly flavorful, and I had leftovers for dinner. Next time I will be trying those steamed pork buns because the picture someone has put on Yelp looks awesome!",

I don't think I'd be able to replicate Futo Buta's ramen very easily!   My girlfriend was feeling ramen on a Sunday and after scanning Yelp, she narrowed down her search to Futo Buta. We placed an order to pick up and got there quickly. We are new around the area so it took us a few minutes to find the place, but took no time at all once we were in!  We brought our respective ramen bowls and our Japanese friend chicken home and dug in. The chicken tasted GREAT. It had lost a lot of crunchiness due to the 15 minute ride back home but that's to be expected. I can imagine when fresh, the chicken is incredible. The sauce served with the JFC was SO good.  I ordered the seasonal ramen that came with vinegar ginger soy, smoke porked belly, leek, scallion, serrano, spicy ground pork, bamboo, wakame, ginger, onsen egg, and I added bok choy. A little vat of broth also came with it that was delicious. It wasn't a ton of broth, but enough to coat all the ingredients and noodles which I prefer as opposed to a more soupy ramen.   My girlfriend got the Tonkotsu ramen which was more on the soupy ramen side and was very earthy I guess due to the mushrooms, but that was pretty good too.  As I mentioned, I'm not the biggest ramen fan, but the next time I get a craving I'll definitely be going back to Futo Buta.",

    "text": "Man, I have had a tasty week. Another of my fave spots in the Queen City is Futo Buta. Banging ramen (the best in the area). Awesome Apps, great service and fun decor. We always get the Miso Ramen bowl and add spice ground pork. The portion size is right and the blend of flavors is a work of art. The crispy rice squares are another go to. It's a fried rice appetizer served with spicy tuna and soy sauce. The Japanese fried chicken app and the brussell sprouts are other go to appetizers for us.  Really, we have not had much that is not good. The only downside is that it's a small space. So, if they are packed then you are out of luck. There is outside seating which is great in the spring or summer, not so much in the Winter. The inside looks really cool and we have never been disappointed by the staff's friendliness. Charlotte is really doing some great things when it comes to local cuisine with a worldly touch. Futo Buta is one of the bright spots.",

    "text": "No more ramen around town looking for an authentic dinner experience - Futo Buta is a gem! (There's my attempt at a punny intro, feedback appreciated lol) But in all seriousness, I came to Futo Buta for a date night and it was perfect. It has a fun and vibrant atmosphere that is great when you wanna change things up from the usual quiet laid back date night dinner. Futo Buta is a small, intimate and unique spot to try out!   Pro Tip, getting a table can be tricky during busy hours, so plan accordingly to get there early and get your name on the list, then grab yourself a drink at the bar while you wait or explore the area around. Once you get a table, prepare yourself for ramen that comes second only in my book to authentic ramen I had in Hong Kong, can't beat that, sorry. Nonetheless, I had the Tonkatsu Ramen bowl with the chilli oil added and it was wonderful! It was definitely on the spicier end so be ready for that with this dish, but the broth was rich and the pork had this amazing pecan smoked taste to it.   Overall, this is a great dinner spot to take people from out of town, or impress someone on a date. I'm definitely going back to try their non ramen menu items as well because they just looked so delicious!",

Recommended: Donbury, Hamachi Crudo and the Tori Kara Age. The Tonkatsu Ramen is good too. Unfortunately, their Buta bowl (ramen) and especially the Poke-mon Chips are wayyy too salty. My suggestion is when you order ramen here, tell them to go easy with the Tare (pronounced tah-reh).   But the highlight of our visit was the honey macha soft ice cream. Believe me, leave some space for this one. It is really smooth, not bitter and just the right taste of macha.",

It helped make it more comfortable to sit SO close to others but I personally enjoy the community table aspect.  I didnt get a photo of the pork bao (steamed buns) but we dug into them so fast. Honestly, I was happy, but they were extremely sweet to me, my taste buds were craving just a hint of acidity which was nowhere to be found. I was so excited for them too... onto the tofu, it was good, I enjoyed the texture but quite lacking in flavor, I love the taste of just plain tofu but I felt like they needed a yuzu soy sauce or something of the sort. With the chili oil they were good.  Salmon belly nigiri was by far the favorite of our small plates. I got the Tonkotsu,  and honestly I hold a very high standard for this Umami,  silky, fatty broth and this satisfied my craving,  but again, the broth wasnt as savory or fatty creamy as I like. Obviously the ramen is not traditional,  but it is delicious none the less. The pork belly and duck confit on top were melt in your mouth and quite delicious , my boyfriends ramen bowl was tasty as well, it had some sort of ground meat in it and pork belly. The noodles were a bit thin, but held onto the broth just as you would want them to. Their sake list is to die for, we got a flight. The Fat Frog was definitely the best pairing with my tonkotsu,  (I also added kimchee sauce and chili oil) overall I am very pleased with our trip to Futo Buta. Service here was fast, it was a fun place, and we will definitely be back!",

The first thing we noticed was the extremely angry and rage-fueled music. Then I noticed the f-bombs in the music. It got so bad I took my very impressionable young son for a walk while the food came out. When we returned to the table, the f*c#@d and f#ks in the music continued. On a Sunday afternoon. I left angry and my FIL had to leave early because the music upset him. The brussel sprouts were amazing though. Highlight of the meal actually.",

We arrived and there were only two tables seated and you could tell they were finishing up their meal. We appeared to be the only two people in the restaurant waiting to be seated. We sat ourselves and waited for our server. After about 10 minutes and no eye contact from the three servers behind the bar I asked for a menu from a passing waitress. She returned with menus and brought  us some water. She appeared to be a little short with us since I had to ask for my own menus and service. She stated that we can sit in our chairs at the high table, but if they get busy we would need to move our place to another area. I asked if we should move now,  because I was not going to move in the middle of my dinner. She said no that's ok, but if it gets busy I will have to seat you somewhere else.  My wife and I did not appreciate the way we were received and treated so we left the restaurant before even ordering. You may ask why two stars. The first one is because you cannot leave less than one star. The other star is because this experience lead us to a fantastic restaurant down the street named the Seoul Food Meat Company.  We were greeted a smile , and the food was out of this world.",

We went around 8pm on a Friday and waited only 5 minutes for a seat-however within 10 minutes there was a line out the door. We were seated at the bar. Keep in mind this place is pretty tiny, and you will usually be sharing a table with another party. However, they do have a nice sized patio with 2-4ppl tables.   We started with a mix and match of the pork belly and duck steam buns ($10). I'm not a fan of pork belly because I think it's too \"fatty\" tasting, but I have to say the pork belly bun was my fav. It had a spicy bbq sauce on it and the pork belly was cooked to perfection! The buns were 2-3 bite sizes so for $10 I'm not sure if I would order them again. Everyone and their mother around us were ordering the rice squares that looked awesome! Will try that next time.   For our meals I got the fire and ice bowl ($13) and my husband got the miso hungry bowl and added the spicy pork to it ($12+$2pork). The fire and ice was awesome until I tried my husbands! Wow the miso stole my heart! It was so flavorful and the spicy pork REALLY made it spicy, but not too powerful. The miso also came with an egg on top that was cooked perfect. The flavors were awesomely paired together!   After our meals I learned you can get the miso and sub the pork belly with salmon. In addition you can ask for them to make your bowl spicy or ask for the spice on the side. I will definitely be back soon and be ready to spice things up!   Ps. If you're watching your carbs you can get any bowl without ramen. I heard someone order that and instantly judged them inside my head LOL!!!  Word of the wise- get the noodles. yOLO!",

But the yummy food covered the awkwardness. We always try to get an appetizer, everywhere we go so we got the Rice Crispy Squares. Rice Crispy Squares are fried rice squares with Spicy Tuna and Wasabi Soy. Sort of a build it yourself kind of appetizer (picture below). This was probably my favorite dish of the night. The Ramen was very good too, but if you aren't use to things with lots of flavor... You may not enjoy it as much. All in all, it was a cute place to eat and had very flavorful foods. I would like to go back and try some of their Buns and Donburi.  Recently I tried their GreenTea & Honey Ice cream... OMG IT WAS TO DIE FOR! It does have an acquired taste but it is absolutely delicious.",

Lunch time tends to be crowded, but I haven't waited over 10 minutes which isn't bad (IMO) for the lunch rush.   Their seasonal, butternut squash ramen SO GOOD. Be careful, all those add-in options will get you.",

This can probably be redeemed by requesting that the noodles be extra firm (I'll try that next time).  Aside from ramen, Futo Buta offers a variety of beers, appetizers, and rolls as well. Although I haven't explored other parts of the menu yet, the customers around us seemed satisfied and I will definitely look into this in future visits.",

I tried his and it was not to my liking at all, but he enjoyed it, which is all that matters. We sat at the bar which doesn't bother me the least, except when they put us at the end and my dad literally had to sit kitty corner since there wasn't much room. I think the seating bothered me the most, just wish there was more space at the bar to be relax and not stiff.",

This place is a bit hard to find for the first time since they aren't located off the street where you can see like crispy crepe. Instead it's right beside the light rail.   I got the seasonal ramen this time called Hiyashi and I would not recommend it at all. Instead of broth it's ramen noodle tossed in a vinegar ginger soy dressing which would be fine but the noodles were drench in the dressing so much that almost half of my bowl was filled up with the vinegar. Stick to the regular ramen with soup.   I also got their swirl soft serve which was half matcha and half blueberry. It was really good epically the honey drizzle on top of the matcha side. The blueberry side was more tart than sweet.",

I sat at the bar which was fun watching the hustle and bustle. The lady next to me can put in your elbow in front of me and flipping her hair which obviously is not the restaurants fault lol just wanted to throw that in there if you're sitting at the bar and make sure you have a little Elbow Room. Anyways on to the food my Ramen is really good, I've never had to add Sprouts in before that usually comes standard so it stunk a little because it didn't pick up the flavor of the broth. Wasn't crazy about the egg being poached usually when I have Ramen it's a pickled egg or something of a hard-boiled egg. When I went to go cut it up it just kind of oozed into the broth and there wasn't really substance to eat. The only thing I have to say about my broth it was a bit oily you could see the oil separating from the broth. Other than that the ramen was good the flavor was definitely there. I also ordered edamame which he definitely got the bang for your buck on that. overall I would definitely go back and possibly try a different Ramen.",

The service was incredible and I was even given a free appetizer due to a mistake made in the kitchen. The pork buns are great and decently priced, the gyoza was very good, but the ramen. . . then ramen is where things went wrong. Typically when I order ramen I run out of noodles pretty quickly, so I figured this time around I would order extra noodles. When they set my miso ramen on the bar the first thing I tasted was the broth. The broth was fairly bland and they do not give you a lot of meat. I realize this is typical for ramen, but they really do not give you a lot of meat so I would recommend ordering extra. After a short while I noticed the broth gradually worsened in flavor. Due to ordering extra noodles, the broth was ruined entirely. I almost wish the server would have warned me, but since it was mostly my mistake I refuse to give this restaurant any less than 4 stars. I plan to go back and try the ramen as it comes.",

The place was hard to find and once we got there we realized how tiny it was. The wait was about 30 minutes. The smoke pork belly buns were really good. It was $10 for two small buns with a piece of pork each. I ordered the Niwa ramen and it was okay. I had to add in the ono chili sauce to give it a little heat to it. The taste of the broth was pretty good but the ramen noodles weren't that great. The broth was a bit too greasy. I ordered my little boy the \"little noodle\" and it was wayyyy too greasy and super salty (almost inedible). My fiancee ordered the Miso ramen and his was salty and greasy as well. We had to stop by Chick-fil-a to get something to eat afterwards. I guess at the end of the day we can say we tried something new, but I wouldn't go back.",

I don't like the food here, to me it's bland, 3 slices of meat, an egg, some thinly sliced veggies in some salty grease broth with a 10 cent pack of ramen noodles. You get all that for the low price of $14.00. It's soup...for 14 dollars who wouldn't love that.  Now my wife and all her friends LOVE this place! Me and my friends don't get it. I will say that the patio is super nice. I have tried a few things off the menu and the thing I can say I actually like is the pork buns. Do I think two tiny pork belly buns are worth 10$ no, no I don't.   Service has always been great, but overall I think this place is all hype made by hipsters that think ramen ate in a tight space automatically makes it amazing. FYI, they don't carry any american beers either.",

    "text": "1st visit on Saturday with a group of friends. Get here early or prepare to wait. Luckily we were there at 11:30 and we had no problem getting a table right away.  The menu is simple. Ramen items range from $12-14. Appetizers from $4-12. I ordered the gyoza ($7) and the Shoyu ramen ($12), $20 for a lunch can be a little steep.  I liked the gyoza, 5 to an order and they are smaller in size. Nice golden crust, the dumpling wrap was of good thickness (not too doughy). Tasty.  My ramen, as mentioned before as well, was more noodles than soup. I was able to finish the whole thing in 1 seating (I contemplated half way through to pack it up... but who was I kidding). The pork meat was good, very tender, 3 small pieces. The soup was a little TOO salty, a little overpowering. Next time I'll try the other flavor.  I think what knocked the experience down a little was the choatic service. I understand they are still new, and having unexpected issue (broken tap machine) was forgivable, but forgetting to bring a glass for canned beer (and after being asked for one), delivering food to the wrong person (as in the person who arrived last should not have received food 1st), and other service related mishaps should have been avoided.  I hope it's just a matter of growing pain - but they need to grow fast to catch up on the popular demand or service will continue to suffer.   Food 4 Value 3.5 Service 2.5",

I could go on and on about the food because it's absolutely amazing, but this review is about my experience. Hands down the best customer service I've ever received, from the hostess, to the bartender, to the multiple servers that brought us our food.  But the absolute rockstar was our waitress.  Her name was Janeille, and she was the most knowledgeable, friendly, mindful server I've ever had, and I dine out a ton.  At one point I actually asked if she was the owner, because the amount of menu knowledge she had and enthusiasm for the restaurant was off the chart. I would open a restaurant tomorrow that centered around the sort of customer service our table received last night.    We didn't go 5 minutes without her coming to bus a plate, dirty napkin, glass, etc...as she said \"I hate dirty tables\"!  Dirty/unbused tables are my pet peeve.  Every server should train under Janeille. I'd go back to Futo just based on the food, which is out of this world.  The combination of food/service has me asking why I'm not eating dinner there seven nights a week.",

After trying with a group of friends shortly after they opened last year this is one of my favorite spots.  Be prepared to wait Futo Buta--located off the Bland Street light rail stop--is a small spot that reminds me of restaurants I've tried in NYC, you're going to be shoulder to shoulder with strangers no matter where you sit in this restaurant.   The menu consist of various ramen dishes that range from vegetarian to hearty. Adding pork belly and duck to the ramen are two of my favorite options. The food is perfectly seasoned and all the taste mesh great together and the price is good. If you're looking for something different or to show off Charlotte to out of town guest you can't go wrong with Futo Buta.",

Our waitress was super nice and helped us decide what to order, since we had never been there before. We ordered Brussel Sprouts as a starter. They were excellent. Then we had some bowl of Ramen noodles, which was also incredibly tasty. My wife and I shared it, since we didn't want to overeat. It was plenty for us to share, though we are light eaters. Then we had one of their homemade ice cream's for desert. Our waitress recommended a Sake flight. Since I'm a Sake novice, that we're out perfectly. I was pretty impressed with it. Definitely a place that is worth a visit and has a decently cool vibe to it.",

Man this place gets packed! There's not that much room on the inside, or outside and this is a really popular place. When I arrived on a Friday evening, there was a 45 minute wait. I heard good things about this place and was willing to wait for it. The waitstaff easily took down my phone number and as I went to walk around, received a simple text to return back.   Everything looked and smelled extremely fresh. The waitress was very informative and helped us decide which was her favorite option of all the Ramen combinations.  One thing that I was a bit skeptical was how \"wordy\" Futo Buta got with describing their dishes. Like I don't expect this place to have Wagyu beef..  Regardless, I had a great experience and had a great meal. Our group also split a bottle of Sake which was equally as refreshing. Kanpai!",

I have a new appreciation for what's going on here. It's a great concept, but the space isn't comfortable at all - I don't think it's supposed to be.  It's a fast noodle joint in tight quarters with loud music.  And in that sense, it's kind of authentic to what Japanese noodle spots are like.  Futo Buta's recipes are solid, everything including the ramen noodles are super-fresh, and you'll be more than satisfied when you leave.  I personally enjoy the vegetable broth.  The pork and pork belly are very rich (but awesome).   We love the decor and were impressed with the creative wall murals, nice pottery used in service (made specifically for this place). If you are not sure about this place after the first time, try it again at a less busy hour.  Worked for me.  I love it!",

The interior has a tiny dining room with long community bars that people can sit at, just like the ones in Japanese Ramen bars. The patio outside is awesome, even when it's cold (they have heat lamps out there). It has a great view of the city at night and the little train goes right by.   They have a great Sake selection. We asked for a recommendation and we had one that had hints of lavender, nice and dry - just sweet enough. The crispy rice squares are killer, the pork steam buns are amazing and the tuna nigiri = OMG!   We shared some ramen as well and it was the best. I've had ramen in a house in Japan and this was just as good, really quite nice.  They also do soft serve with cool flavors - like Green Tea and Honey. Totes yummy!  A little gem of a place!

The place is pretty small so when we sat I felt like I was all in the next persons bubble. We started out with the pork buns which were really great, then we moved onto the ramen. I had the Miso and it pretty good, my only complaint was that the broth was salty. Overall we had a nice time and the staff was attentive!",

Usually at ramen places there is a pork broth and a flavorless vegetarian broth, but this has chicken broth, dashi broth, aforementioned pork broth and a vegan broth. We added spicy oil to the ramen and that definitely kicked it up a notch. The tuna appetizer on crispy rice was sooo good! It was like the innards from a spicy tuna roll served with a pillow of deep fried sushi rice.   The place was packed when we went on a random Tuesday night which is usually a good sign. We ended up parking on the street since it was hard to figure out which lot is for this building. Will be back!",

The ramen looked decent - I would much rather have char siu than the smoked pork belly they use, but that is just my personal preference, my friend liked the smoked pork belly. The big problem was with the taste. There was none. The broth was both bland and a little spicy at the same time. I even added some of the shichimi togarashi they keep on the bar. Still bland, but at least it was at the spice level I wanted.   The noodles were slightly under cooked as well. I will say, they did a good job with the egg -- it was custardy and milky.   The service was quite good and the waiters were friendly.  Overall, not impressed with the food, but I'd give them another try before completely writing them off.",

A little tricky to find by street address alone but located right on train track across and down from Taco, near parking garage and across from the media school. It was a Tuesday night and the place was packed, with a wait. It is a small place (hope you like cozy) with a combination of long tall table seating, short shelf against the wall, bar and traditional sit down. I can only imagine the wait on the weekends. We started off with some small plates, hands down the KUROBUTA PORK AND GOLDEN SCALLOP GYOZA did not linger long. Could have easily put another plate away, def recommend. The TORI KARA AGE (JAPANESE FRIED CHICKEN) I thought was OK. I would pass next time, but then again not a big fried fan. The LOW COUNTRY SMOKED PORK BELLY bun was again decent. We also tried one of the featured sushi rolls and some salmon tartare, both were decent. The FIRE N ICE Ramen - kimchi broth, hot smoked salmon, fresh mint, cabbage, shaved carrot, radish, black sesame, was every bit of wonderful and I do recommend. We ended the meal with some flavored soft serve they feature, which was a very appropriate ending after all the spices and flavors we encountered. The bar features sake, wine, and beer. Spices offered on the side to use at your own discretion include soy sauce, sesame oil, and Sriracha sauce. The crowd mostly was comprised of young professionals.",

I've done take out Chinese and Thai a million times, Ramen however - I hadn't done that. I was a little skeptical, but we went for it anyway. I am happy to report that take-out ramen can be Amazing! it didn't get cold or soggy or ... well may be the presentation got a wee bit messed up, but I can live with that.  We got a few different items off the menu - roasted eggplant and zucchini buns, fire and ice & Chizu ramen, hamachi crudo and tofu skewers. My most favorite was the fire & ice ramen and least favorite were the tofu skewers. The ramen was salty, spicy, and just overall flavorful - exactly what I was craving! the skewers were flavorful, but a little too sweet and saucy for me. I enjoyed the buns and hamachi, but I have mixed feelings about the chizu ramen. An overly cheesy / eggy ramen is not typically what I think of when I think ramen.  I look forward to dining at the restaurant in the near future, but if that doesn't happen soon enough, I'll be going back for more take out.",

    "text": "I was pumped to hear that there was a Ramen house in Charlotte. I come down here x3-4 a times a year from NYC and love that there is more diverse restaurants developing here.   I ordered the:  Pork buns- asked for no sesame slaw- it was pretty solid but for $5 a piece (comparable price to NYC) it better beat out any of David Changs restaurants, Baohous, or Ippudo buns- didn't compare.  Rice Crispy: This was worth it- it's sushi rice fried with tuna on the side.   *Miso Ramen: By far the worst Ramen I've had, however it \"looked\" really good...   Broth was weak and super oily- soup is usually oily looking but it adds to the taste, this added no flavor. Temperature was lukewarm, noodles were soggy- textures vary from shop- but this was clearly overcooked or sitting in the soup for a while which would explain the lukewarm temp. The \"soft boiled\" egg that typically comes in Miso was raw- I cut into it then it just disappeared in the soup. This isn't supposed to happen, the egg white is supposed to be cooked through and the egg yolk should be runny. The Chasu- was rubbery and had a BBQ flavor- doesn't match the bowl flavoring.  *to be fair, I am very particular about Ramen- spending time in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. So this very well may suite the taste of the south and people not familiar with Ramen. With that said, I think there should be a disclaimer for twists on the Ramen via BBQ chasu in traditional Miso. I'm definitely open to new tastes but it has to flow, Tokyo is well known for this and Ramen Lab in NYC is too.  In the end, I didn't want to write a review but: 1) The Ramen is priced like NYC so it should be at the bare minimum decent.   2) The server saw I didn't eat the Ramen and didn't care one bit.  I hope that they fix the issues because it's so amazing that a Ramen house is open in Charlotte!",
