Service was amazing and the ambience was finally what I've been looking to recreate from my missed days in NY....great place to meetup with friends, thank goodness Leroy's made it to Southend!!

My friend, husband and I all sat at a booth, where we literally watched the bartender stand and talk with his group of friends for the entire 1.5 hrs of our visit (I'm not sure how the female bartenders could stand it? I'd hate to think he's a manager). While I'm all for a good time, I'd highly doubt his boss would have been pleased if he had heard what we did. An entire 15 minute conversation where he loudly discussed last night where he was stoned (I almost wrote the details of his story but I think it would mortify the business and he'd possibly lose his job... I will leave it at \"Pineapple Express\") Not the classiest. The food was good.. Mac n cheese was the best along with the fried zucchini. The flavors were all pretty good but I'd recommend they don't run out of two sides (sweet potato tots and potato wedges)on a Sunday lunch. Overall I'd go back to try it for sure... and hopefully the staff is all actually working when I do.",

They had used Meyer rum over goslings which as a rum drinker made a big difference to the drink and it just sat at the table with the ice melting in it.  Our server never cleared our table and didn't ask about the drink which just soured the experience and we were charged for the drink.  But the cocktails we did order off the menu were good.",

The second time I went in with a friend who was visiting he had the fried chicken which he said was really good and I had the berry salad. The service is good they tell you up front they fry the chicken when it's ordered so it takes about 20-25 mins. However I ordered the Berry salad and I didn't want the chicken and I was still charged the same 15.75 for the salad without chicken. Prices should be made different when you take off one of the most expensive items on the dish. Many places in charlotte do that. So basically I paid for it even not having it. Other than that I like this place.",

We were assured that service would be quick. We were seated and had to wait over an hour for food. We watched others get seated 20 or more minutes after us and their food was promptly served soon after they arrived. They were not even busy. When our food was finally served some of the plates were cold and had to be sent back. Our server was nice but didn't seem to have any help. The food was good, I had a salmon salad that was nicely cooked, buffalo cauliflower was delicious. When we got ready to leave I asked the bartender for a to-go cup of ice, one of our guests was sick from allergies and she looked at me with disgust and didn't even slide the cup to me. She sat it in a corner and walked off. It's disappointing to spend so much money on food and beverage to only be treated poorly in the end by staff that don't appreciate their jobs. I brought a party of 15, and could've took my business elsewhere where it would be appreciated.",

I went in already thinking I would love it and left so utterly disappointed.  I would still rank atmosphere a 5/5.  Food, service, experience was all a 1/5.  The food was just terrible. Nothing tasted good. Chicken tenders were honestly disgusting, the pretzel bites were 100% pulled from a freezer, the fried zucchini was nothing special and too big of slices to enjoy. Our server was really trying but just failed all together. He was running around constantly but forgot our water and silverware numerous times. The drink menu was fun and different but honestly just very overpriced. Really bummed out.",

With a group of 14, the wait staff managed to make is feel as if we are the only ones there. The dinner happened to be the same day as National Margarita Day !! The silver fox margarita was on the sweet side, but mellowed out once I added a squeezed lime. I will add that although I didn't taste the tequila in the drink (I'm a tequila snob), I felt it afterwards!   Not particularly hungry, I ordered the chicken tenders. I know, I know not the most extravagant item on the menu, but oh well! They were hot and crispy! I added a wee bit of salt and was pleasantly content. The ranch dressing was a prefect pairing. The mustard sauce was a little pungent and took away from the flavor of the chicken tender. Thanks to KTs birthday, a local gent bought us a few shots and beers! It pays to have gorgeous friends! I'll definitely return to both locations and expand my palate.",

The waiter was a little young and off his game, but we were able to recognize his spaciness and manage him accordingly.  There is an inside or outside option to dine.  If you sit outside, it is completely covered so you aren't uncomfortable with too much sun.  The bar is awesome too if you want to sit there.  They have TVs playing also!  We didn't make a reservation but were seated immediately.  Being a vegetarian, I was concerned about what they had to eat for me.  I was surprised to discover they have a wrap that turned out to be something I now crave daily.  I would make one suggestion, they should offer some sauce on the side to put on the wrap to add some flavors.  I used the salad sauce from my friend's salad on my wrap and it was sooooo good!!!  I also got a side of the green bean casserole and it also did not disappoint.  The cheese was delicious!  I will certainly be back for round two very soon.  I'm glad our funny bus tour mentioned that this was a great place to eat, because we are so happy to have experienced this exceptional dining experience for ourselves.",

He started off strong and then he was just blah. A friend from out of town ordered the chicken & waffles and it usually comes with an apricot compote. Me and a friend were telling her how good it was on it so she ordered it. When her food came out, there was no compote. After waving down our waiter she asked him about it, he just responded \"oh we're out of that\" and walked away. Not sure why it wasn't communicated when ordered or once he knew but then was just very uncaring.  I ordered my fav the Zucchini fries love them with the boom boom sauce and I tried something new with the honey buffalo chicken sandwich. It was good, enjoyed the pickled green tomatoes on it! I love the setup in the location with the outdoor patio and the huge bar in the middle of the restaurant and the food is always good but I'll stick to going to the Cotswald location for the better service.",

    "text": "I am blown away by the number of stars this establishment has.   I was getting together with a few friends last night and they picked Leroy Fox South End, being new to the area, I was excited to give this place a try. I've heard the decor is trendy and cozy but the food isn't anything to write home about. With that being said, I tried to go in with an open mind, but now I understand why I was given such stark reviews from the get-go.  Walking in, I wasn't instantly greeted and waited at the host stand for 5 minutes before I was acknowledged. Finally, I was whisked away to a booth.  Again, it took several minutes of awkward sitting and waiting until our server greeted us and brought us water. Without an introduction, or note of specials he left and didn't come back for what felt like 20 minutes. We didn't order until 8:15 and I arrived at 7:30. This seemed very strange. Other tables seemed to be getting rather good service, so I don't know why we weren't.   The grub: +Meh. This is a disaster area for a vegetarian. Sure, there are fish options, but no tofu, sweet potatoes or just general no meats.  +One saving grace- sweet potato tots. These things were like little balls of heaven. They melt in your mouth and there is a subtle hint of cinnamon! YUM! +White Wine- served at room temperature. NOPE.  The final straw that broke the camel's back was the check game. I had to request the check and 10 minutes later our server came back with checks for us. Awesome. I paid cash. My total was $12.99 and I left $15. Typically if I leave enough with tip, I say something along the lines of,  \"I don't need change\" or \"the rest if for you.\" Well, I had a few singles and I was assuming (if it was a good server) I'd get change. Nope. He never came back with my change, so that was his tip. Honestly, I wasn't planning on leaving more because the service was so horrendous anyway.   TL;DR: abysmal service, too loud for a conversation and not very veggie friendly. Will I be back? NOPE.",

I'd only ever gotten drinks at the Cotswold location, and I have to give this South End location two thumbs up on atmosphere, food, and of course their signature drinks.  First off, I've FINALLY found a place to watch sporting events that isn't too much of a \"sports bar\" that only serves nachos, wings, and domestic beer. Some friends and I gathered to watch rivalry week football games, and it was an awesome environment! Huge TVs, hopping 360 bar, and they seated us in a half-circle booth so we could all face a TV.  I'm so in love with watching sporting events here now because of the delicious food. I greatly appreciate when a restaurant known for it's fried chicken has banging vegetarian options as well. I had their southwest salad with blackened shrimp and their house pineapple-sriracha dressing. Delicious! They also had some of the most perfect potato wedges I've ever seen (not greasy, crispy outside, thick cut), and really good sweet potato tots. Thanks friends for letting me try your stuff. The wraps everyone else ordered also got rave reviews.  I really loved the ambiance of everyone hanging out on a Saturday night. It felt like a neighborhood joint with great decor, friendly staff, and good cuisine on top of it all! Will definitely be back.",

Our server, Derek, was excellent. My wife enjoyed his beer recommendation. He had great recommendations and his recommendations were spot on. We had the fried chicken. We tried both the \"home style\" and \"buffalo\" style. Derek said he preferred the home style and my wife and I agreed. The home style was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy within. The buffalo style was good with the right amount of kick, but we definitely recommend getting the home style. The Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious! The Brussels sprouts with bacon - a dish my wife and I love to cook - we're ok. They could've been cooked a little longer. We had the bread pudding for desert - it came out looking better than the picture. The tables on each side of us asked us what we got as it looked sooo good ... and it was!",

I was hesitant on trying this one due to the food not being so great when i went to the one by SouthPark. However, I was invited for a birthday brunch and thought this would be a good time to try it again. We had a large party about 30 people we got there early and the staff was very professional and made sure we were seated in a decent time after setting up the tables. The server Ashley was pretty on top of things and I know it was a lot so i give her my kudos. I started with a mimosa but two drinks caught my eye the champagne mojito and another drink called for whom the berry trolls. I chose the berry trolls which was a tequila mix with honey jalapenos and cake with a jalapenos infused ice shell. It was surprisingly better than I thought but that jalapeno spice may be one I pass on. Next time I will aim for the champagne mojito. For food, I ordered the Sadie Mae omelette with a side of hash brown casserole. The omelette was very good but overloaded with gruyere cheese and the hash brown tasted like it was mayo based or possibly sour cream I guess. Either way it decent breakfast food but I may order something different next time. The ambiance was really nice though a lot of TVs everywhere and very casual and welcoming. The shrimp and grits looked good too and is going to be on my list for next time.",

They have a dish called the 1/4 North that comes with a side, I recommend the brussel sprouts or mac and cheese. Put it with their honey hot sauce and you will be sure to thank me later. They have two locations but the South End location is my go to. There's street parking but you've got to search sometimes for a good spot. Doesn't matter because the food is worth it. If you need a good appetizer, try the zucchini fries or the pretzels. I'm literally craving this as I type.",

The bbq chicken sandwich was super messy and had way too much sauce on it - would ask for this on the side next time.  The chicken fried chicken was good - the gravy was tasty.  We have tried the sweet potato tots, green bean casserole, and macaroni and cheese.  The sweet potato tots are good - slightly sweet and very good with the honey mustard.  The mac & cheese is great here, probably my favorite side.  The green bean casserole is topped with fried onions and is delicious.  Overall, good food but service can be improved on.",

It seems like they still have some kinks to work out because they forgot the gravy for the Chicken Fried Sandwich and they forgot the blue cheese for the Honey Buffalo Sandwich. They corrected the problem and both were delicious. The Honey Buffalo Sandwich had a bit of a kick. The Chicken Fried Sandwich was my favorite! I would have loved more gravy on it, it was so good. We got the mac and cheese and sweet potato tots as our sides. The mac and cheese was definitely the star of the show. It was some of the best mac and cheese I've had in the south. The sweet potato tots were good too, but they are pretty sweet (rolled in honey, etc), so the mustard on the side was necessary.   For dessert we tried the banana pudding, the bread pudding, and the toffee tollhouse. The banana pudding was pretty good, but I've had better. It needed more bananas for sure. The waiter knew that I didn't like chocolate after I asked about another dessert, but he failed to mention that they put chocolate sauce all over the bread pudding, so that was kind of annoying. I heard nothing but great things about the toffee tollhouse.   All in all, it was a great meal and I would say the best fried chicken I've had in Charlotte so far (still need to try Haberdish and the Shell gas station). We'll definitely be coming back!",

When we finally got a waitress she seemed annoyed that we complained about waiting, and she was a little snarky too. She took our orders without bothering to write anything down. Well, my order was wrong so I had to wait to get my tater tots, which were clearly sitting around since they were soggy and lukewarm. It took forever to get the bill. Everything was going wrong. My food overall was okay at best. I think my daughter thought hers was good. Fortunately, the manager was excellent at damage control, and genuinely nice about our bad experience, and gave us our meals on the house. It's for that reason alone that I'd try this place one more time.",

I could go on and on about those things. In addition to the Brussel sprouts I also tried the fried zucchini, fried green tomatoes, buffalo cauliflower, and the Salmon BLT. I promise I didn't have all of that myself. I shared lol. Needless to say, everything was amazing! Everything was seasoned and fried to perfection. The salmon was grilled perfectly. The food came out relatively fast and the waiter was extremely personable. The one downside was it was very noisy inside and the music was loud, which made having conversations difficult. We did go on a Friday night so it may be quieter on a week day. My first visit I sat outside and noise wasn't an issue.   Overall, if you don't try this place and love it, I'll question your taste buds lol",

    "text": "I think they still have a few more kinks to work out here, but I had a great time in this new location of Leroy Fox! The Lady and I used to live relatively near the cotswold(ish) location and I've missed it since we moved outside of uptown, but I'm SO glad that we get it back!  So first off, the patio and the lights are irresistible especially from the street. It's gorgeous. Seated quickly without reservation on a Friday night, which is allllways nice. We started out with a drink - got a Cucumber Basil Lemonade which was very nice. For dinner, I ordered the honey buffalo chicken sandwich, grilled, with a side of brussel sprouts. The Lady ordered a side of the sweet potato tots for both of us to demolish. I can't comment on what she got, because it disappeared too quickly. My sandwich was awesome - though not a ton of heat (which was okay for the mood I was in), but all flavors worked very well. The tots, as stated, were obliterated. Didn't even touch the sauce that came with them.   The reason that I knocked off the one star is kind of two fold. The food, while awesome especially for a casual dinner, wasn't... I don't know, deserving of five stars? It wasn't as good as it gets. And the second point was that The Lady and I ordered a second drink, The Alexa, and it is just *not* good. We were told that it was made incorrectly, and it was taken off the bill and replaced with another Cucumber Basil Lemonade, but I'm surprised that either a) the person who mixed it messed up that badly and hadn't been trained or b) they have it on the menu at all. Just a bad combination of flavors, even our waitress agreed with us haha.  But please - don't take those as True negatives. There is so, so much good here, and it'll keep us coming back to try more off the menu!!  Oh yea, and as Nikki pointed out so elegantly, they have the good ice with all drinks. Twenty points for Leroy Fox!!",

I came to the bar and was told I had 5 minutes to order food before they shut down so I rushed through the menu. I got in an order of their famous 1/4 chicken with a side of greens. In closing mode, I wasn't expecting service to be great and maybe that also impacted the food. The chicken was just plain awful and not cooked evenly. There wasn't any flavor to either the breading or the chicken itself to the point I just left it there. The zucchini spears were ok, but mostly because of the zucchini. The place overall looks cool and would be great to watch sports or events in, but I just had a bad experience that wouldn't take me back. Maybe for a drink because their bar did seem to be fairly decent, but definitely not for food.",

I usually get their buffalo chicken salad because I'm obsessed with their buffalo vinaigrette. Today I had to switch it up (very slightly) and go with the  Honey Buffalo grilled chicken sandwich. I absolutely love the fact that they use pickled green tomatoes on their chicken sammies. My friend got the green bean casserole (a warning: it has a layer of cheese) and I went with the brussel sprouts. I could easily just go there and eat a giant bowl of brussels. I never get the fried chicken here (I just always want other things), but my buddy really enjoyed his 1/4 South. Oh, and did I mention- THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE!  This is a gorgeous spot, both inside and out. I like the outside wall that is covered in Charlotte street names. TVs both in the restaurant and on the patio.

Bartenders were slammed or understaffed, but it took awhile for us to get service at many times throughout the night, even as the crowd dwindled. Food was on point. I always choose chicken when at Leroy Fox. We both got the Favorite chicken sandwich with brussel sprouts. So good! It is a great place for a meal and definitely try the fried chicken.",

Pleasantly surprised to see they were trying out a new brunch menu the same day I decided to go!  They really did this place justice with a very very nice outdoor patio space, and a gorgeously decorated inside space.  The woody colors and booths really make the place feel comfortable but at the same time can be on the cover of a magazine.  A great space overall with tables and a large bar area in the back.  There's not a really well defined hostess station, but all the servers and staff are super friendly and really make up for the lack of a stand to greet you when you come in.    Our server Matt was super nice and calm.  With the rush of the football crowd and a Panthers away game, the place got packed shortly after we arrived.  Luckily we got a good \"godfather booth\" where you can pretty much see everyone in the restaurant and our backs to the corner.    I tried the chicken and waffles.  Their Leroy Fox signature chicken atop a waffle with peach compote and maple syrup.  Perfectly poached egg on top.  It was amazing.  After food was done, we just sat in our booth and got nice a ready to watch a somewhat mediocre Panthers game.  Ugly win, but a W is a W.  Overall a great experience.  It does tend to be a little on the loud side (could just be me getting old) but I saw some early brunches with little ones.  The restaurant does have high chairs so it can be kid friendly... maybe just not on Sundays during football season.",

I'm sorry, such a cool big space, great drink menu, lovely server, but mediocre chicken in a restaurant that primarily concentrated on chicken. Leroy Fox is a restaurant that with concentrates on making mediocre chicken or serving chicken they purchased from a fast food restaurant( not Popeyes since theirs is far superior). Ordered the zucchini for an appetizer, delish! Unfortunately the food following that didn't extend the trend. My boyfriend and I each ordered different chicken sandwiches, bad choice. It tasted like nasty fast food reheated crap chicken. Other than the large number of TVs on game days and decent drink menu, why?!?!?

We also split an order of wings which were not quite crisp. While the sauce was tasty (how could a combination of buffalo and barbecue not he could?) the less than crisp skin was a bit off putting. Maybe we just got the wrong thing - the fried chicken which another table ordered looked delicious - but given the drinks I don't think I would be back unless someone really wanted to come here.",

My husband ordered the southern chicken sandwich & he was blabbing about it the next morning. The place is in a great location, but difficult to find their name on the building. Lucikly their opened patio helped out a lot. I loved how opened the resturant was & the fact that they had 90's music videos playing on a TV was a conversation in itself. Cant wait to go back & try other menu options.  Our server seemed overly busy & we didn't see her too much which was difficult when we needed something,  but she was sweet & took care of us when needed. Definitly recommended.",

I typically eat at the bar and the service is phenomenal. My favorite is the Homestyle fried chicken dinner with their brussels  sprouts. The chicken has a unique flavor with a bit of a kick to it but not real spicy. Oh and the meat is super juicy. It is always packed, even on the weekdays but once you experience the food and it's beautiful decor, you will understand why it stays busy.  Thank you Leroy Fox for gracing the SouthEnd with your perfect restaurant.",

    "text": "We got the chicken & waffles, crab cake benedict, and the breakfast sundae. All were AMAZING. The reason for the 2 star review was the service.   We were seated after a long wait (which was fine) but no one came around to our table to tell us they were our server. After 15-20 minutes of sitting there and waiting we told a host that no one had come help us yet. Then after another 5 minutes finally a server arrived at our table and was not warm or welcoming at all. We forgot her name but she was a young (asian?) girl with brown hair and blonde ends. She took our orders but forgot to bring us a round of water after we had requested it. We then had to ask her again for waters which she then brought out after our food had arrived. When our food arrived we asked for a small side of butter but she had also forgot that so then we had to ask a food runner to bring it out. When she brought our checks out later on, it took about another 10-15 minutes for her to pick them back up. I understand they were busy during brunch on Sunday but our 2 hour meal could have easily been under an hour if our server was more attentive. And to top it off she was not friendly at all and barely said anything to us... this experience could have been great but unfortunately that server was not well trained at all and ruined things for us.",

I modify the salad to be gluten free and usually choose salmon.  My boyfriend loves the burger.  The wings are excellent, too and not breaded.  There are a few kinks behind the bar that need to be worked out with timing. I'd like to see one person dedicated to the well until like 9ish because they tend to get a bit slammed and service goes down. But all in all I think it will get worked out and the atmosphere/walking distance is enough to earn our consistent patronage--and 5 stars.  Cheers, y'all.",

    "text": "We came to Leroy Fox for dinner - \"part 2\" of girls night out. We heard about the awesome fried chicken and were also impressed by the dessert options.   Our server was great. There were 4 of us, so we ordered 2 of the winner winner chicken dinners with brussel sprouts and Mac n Cheese. Let me tell you how delicious and hot and juicy that chicken was...yum!! But unfortunately that's where it ended. The brussel sprouts with bacon were under seasoned and undercooked -they were still crunchy. The Mac and cheese came out luke warm and had barely any flavor, it tasted like mostly cream and maybe some American cheese.  We sent the Mac and cheese back to be heated and they prepared 2 new orders of it; so it was nice that it was hot, but still no flavor. Not sure who was cooking the sides, but it was a \"miss\" for them on both. Feels like we paid $35 for chicken because the sides we're honestly inedible.    We ended with dessert. We ordered 2 chocolate chip cookies and 2 bread puddings. They were both decent. I will say that the chocolate chip cookies were disproportionate in size. One had a VERY small cookie compared to the other, but we decided not to complain because we needed to get on to part 3 of our night out. I was able to enjoy my bread pudding, but my friend was brought a banana pudding instead. Our server realized the error and went to the kitchen to correct it. A few minutes later, one of the waitstaff brought her another banana pudding... At this point we were done and she had nothing. Well our server arrives with the bread pudding, but now the 3 of us were all done and ready to go, so we juat asked that it be taken off the check. She left disappointed, and to be honest we all did.  Not the greatest first impression \"Leroy\".",

I went with a larger group last week and after our apps came out we were told it would be 30 minutes before we could order so the kitchen could catch up. I really appreciate that honestly instead of having our order taken and sitting there for an hour with no explanation. They weren't super busy, but didn't seem to have a lot of staff on.   Alex was our server and she was amazing!! She kept her cool even with being busy and dealing with a large table. The hostess was also doing a phenomenal job, although I did not catch her name.   When we finally got our food, it was so worth the wait. Everything I tried was delicious. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich as a wrap and loved the addition of fried green tomato. The brussel sprouts are addictingly good. I tried my boyfriends 1/4 chicken and it was perfect and tender. The mashed potatoes were out of this world. I couldn't stop stealing from my boyfriend's plate.   Atmosphere is great, love the decor and overall vibe in there. The patio is really nice as well.  The only thing I wasn't super impressed with was the cocktails, but I am sure they will perfect.   I cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "Food was very good (especially the sweet potato tots) but BEWARE when ordering a drink not off of the cocktail menu.  I am not a huge fan of cocktails so I ordered a margarita. Signature cocktails were $12 so I figured a margarita would be less, because that is the case at every other place I've been in Charlotte if you order a basic drink that is not on the menu. Shame on me for not asking. Three margaritas and $50 later, I was pissed. Yes, these MARGARITAS WERE $17 EACH. Up until this point I had a great dinner and was excited to come back, now I don't think I ever will because this left a horrible taste in my mouth--literally and figuratively.  The consistency of the the drinks was almost as horrendous as the price. My first margarita came in a normal glass (like their water glasses) and tasted strong, but very good. The next two can in a martini type glass and honestly tasted like I was drinking straight tequila. I had to pour ice from my water into the drink to make it bearable. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather it be strong and grimace through it than drink straight mix, but there is a happy medium.  I could deal with inconsistency and poor tasting drinks if the price was right. But this is not Michelin-starred restaurant. We are not in NYC so it doesn't need NYC prices. NO BASIC MARGARITA SHOULD EVER COST $17.",

You would notice the rustic Victorian style chandelier and a mixed seating with sofas that look so laid back and informal that makes you feels like you are in someone's home. I love that they had a variety of seating options, the regular tables, high chairs toward the windows, sofas on one corner, high chair tables and bar stools and even booths! Believe me there is room for everybody! The waitress are awesome and extremely helpful! The menu is short and all southern! The fox Den Wings as starters were awesome - but as others have felt, they are a little smaller than your regular BWW. The Leroy's Favorite crispy chicken sandwich was alright but wished could have been more appetizing as it almost looked like your ChickFilA chicken. Thanked myself for not getting the grilled option which would have been even more bland! The sides are a die for! Choose any side and you won't regret ordering it - satisfies you with both quantity and taste! The prices are nominal and not to pricey. A definite pick for good ambience, great service and good food! Oh, wait, did I tell that there is live music too! Enjoy!",

    "text": "I travel allot so I typically do a bit of research before I visit an establishment. I happen to be in Charlotte for an annual international conference.   So here's the spill.   Ambiance: very trendy, inviting, millennial spots.   Food: I ordered food to go so I didn't eat at the establishment. I ordered the signature fried chicken and brussel sprouts. The chicken was okay,but the brussel sprouts were exceptional.   Service: I ended up walking around the bar a couple times to find a spot to order a drink.  I ended up standing on the side of the wait station next to a gentleman.  All of a sudden one of the bartender(I believe his nickname  was Speed or something)scolds me and says You can't stand there you need to move now.  His delivery was so horrible and rude. It was so loud and rude that the gentleman(whom I later found out was a regular) said hold on,  I'll move down.  I told the gentleman that's ok you and that I couldn't be believe how rude the bartender was and that it wasn't what you say but how you say it.  The bartender proceeds to still try and be confrontational and says well how do you want me to say it. And I tell him I was not talking to you.  He then makes a drink that required smoke and purposely makes an excessive amount of smoke blow directly in my face and in my hair.  The gentleman at the bar says he's really trying to smoke you out now. My throat has been hurting every since.  Now the good.  Quan and Gautreaux are exceptional.  My drinks were made timely and were did the job.  They were very engaged and made me feel better about the better experience. I would definitely give it another chance when I come back.",

The batter they use to fry the chicken in like WOW BABY!! So good ... and the Mac and cheese has white cheddar in it which like hello it doesn't get any better than white cheddar. It came with a jalapeno cornbread which was awesome. I got the pear necessities drink and it was good. My boyfriend got the honey buffalo sandwich and it was gone in like a second. The Cajun fries are so good too. Now, on to the other points I need to make. The interior is so cute. They have a full bar. They have outdoor seating which is better than indoor. The waiters are all attractive. Can I get an amen sister!! Anywayyyyy, I will be back",

The restaurant is very modern on the inside, very intimate and quaint with lots of space at a wrap around bar. My service was excellent. I will be returning!

Shout out to the chef who kicked his sweet potato tots up a notch and added some cinnamon and maybe a little sugar? Sweet potato tots are typically meh to me, but these joints were GOOD! My vegan brother couldn't stop munching on them from my plate. I almost popped his hand.   My shrimp Po boy sandwich was also extremely good. The shrimp was fried perfectly with great flavor. Just the right amount of sauce, fresh lettuce and tomato.   Definitely coming back to this joint. I was told about their fried chicken and I'll have to try that another day. Maybe the next restaurant outing I'll go there instead of my usual Futo Buta.   Not a fan of the \"private\" room. It's an area with no door right near the bathrooms. Aside from the onlookers, Someone popped their head in offering a slurry comment about a party while we were in the midst of discussing the book we read. Yea, next time I need a private room, I'll try a different spot.",

    "text": "So, this one of my family's go to places. . . I mean we go here weekly for weeks at a time. I love their fried chicken and I am a fried chicken aficionado. Though, I generally prefer my fried chicken cooked by some grandma, they have some good chicken. Besides the chicken, we like the mashed potatoes and gravy, the cheesy grits, the hashbowns (only available for brunch), brussel sprouts, and salads. We also love the buffalo wings. I have a list of my favorite wings in Charlotte and theirs is on that list. My wife also really enjoys their shrimp wrap. It's her favorite shrimp wrap.  I am also a fan of their shrimp and grits. As you can see, we have sampled a variety of the menu and haven't had anything we don't like. Now we don't like to use the paper straws, but I guess I'll let it go because everyone is doing it and it's for the environment.  We also like their cocktails and drinks. They have red oak (a local NC beer) which is a win.  Honestly you can't go wrong. Now busy times can be very busy, so planning may be required. Football season tends to be difficult because it gets packed, but its atmosphere is cool; so it's understandable why folk choose this for their sports spot. You can take your date on a nice date, enjoy a whiskey drink and still throw down with some shrimp and grits. Country and classy.",

They do not accept reservations on weekends. Our table was roomy and waiter was fast to get our drink orders. It did take awhile for us to get our food (45 minutes). After 30 minutes of waiting, the waiter said that they no longer had hash brown casserole. My friend was really looking forward to it and it seemed odd to tell us so late in the process. One of my friend's plates had less than half of the fry portion that I was given. They did immediately bring more fries when he brought it to the waiter's attention. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with pimento cheese and an egg. It was tasty, but kind of disappointed when my egg yolk was cooked all the way through. This was a good place to eat, but a few minor flaws with it.",

We went during lunch hours and were seated quickly. I imagine that might not be the case for dinner as this is one of the new, hot spots in South End.   For starters, we had zucchini fries. They were more like zucchini wedges. Massive hand cut and hand dipped slices of zucchini battered and fried to perfection were a great way to set the tone for our lunch. This appetizer comes with two sauces for dipping: a tad spicy remoulade and a classic ranch. The basket is great for sharing; hubby and I could not finish all of ours.   For my entree, I selected the shrimp po boy. I had settled on the shrimp Cobb salad until hubby pointed out this dish that's one of my favorites. For my side, I could not resist sweet potato tots. My shrimp po boy arrived with lettuce (that I asked not be included) but I could easily remove it without ruining my dish. The po boy was about six inches and had maybe 6-8 golden brown shrimp; you could choose between fried or grilled. It's Southern and so am I so I went with fried! It was very tasty and the side of remoulade added just the right kick. Those sweet potato tots were excellent. Cute little bite-sized sweet potatoes dipped in a hint of cinnamon were the perfect side for my po boy! Be warned... they give you an extremely generous portion. I had to take half of them home for our sons to try because I couldn't hold them all!  Great food. Awesome atmosphere. Wonderful service.",

However, I really feel like we shouldn't have had to walk a professional bartender through making a Manhattan. After we got our drinks, we went 25 minutes without seeing our waiter so we finally flagged down a different waiter to place our order. After finally placing our order, it took TWO HOURS for our food to come out. There was no apology and our waiter didn't even stop by in those two hours to give us an update on our food.

The atmosphere was a very nice open concept with bar seats facing the outdoor patio. We ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, the fried chicken, mac n cheese, and the sweet potato tots. The food got better with every bite and we cannot wait to go back and enjoy it again! So happy this is right in our back yard.",

    "text": "This was my first experience at Leroy Fox South End, I will certainly be going back. The restaurant has a great atmosphere perfect place to meet friends or a date night. While I only had drinks there the menu was extensive. The drink I had was the Quinn City Spotlight and if you don't like bitters it's worth getting just for the presentation I thought it was just a little over priced at $12.99 for a drink in a hall ball glass. The others I was with enjoyed their drinks as well. We got there early so the restaurant was not overly crowded and we were all able to enjoy each other's conversation. As the evening progressed it did get pretty loud and we had to yell to hear each other but it was a Friday night. The server was knowledgeable about the menu although a little slow to bring the drinks back to the table. The age range seemed to be about 25-40. The only real complaint that I was they had many TVs in the restaurant and they were all playing the same thing a little variety may be better . All in all I was very impressed with the atmosphere loved the foxes. I suggest you try it if your looking for a relaxed place to meet friends!",

It was a berry cocktail with a jalapeno ice cube and it absolutely rocked.

I ended up taking half my sandwich home for lunch the next day. The craft cocktails were a bit pricey ($14) but you can tell there's a lot of detail and care put into making them.

    "text": "Me, my sisters and my friend tried this place out last night for the first time. If our server wasn't so good to us and the music wasn't decent I definitely would have given this place one star. So initially I was skeptical about this place because I had read reviews that the customer service wasn't that great. I also heard there might be some issues with the service that african american customers receive, and quite honestly I can see where some of the reviews were correct. So upon arrival the hostess was not friendly and her customer service skills were not the best. It was almost as if she wanted us to turn around, to make her life easier, because the place was so crowded. So after we put our name down we head to the bar to get a drink. The bartender initially was decent when he first took our order. However he then appeared agitated because of where we were standing and asked us to move out of the area we were standing so servers could pick up their drinks. There was literally no where else to stand. It was horrible! The drinks on the other hand were almost perfect. I got the cucumber lemon drink (or something like that). There was also a guy who called himself checking in on us a couple times throughout the night (I'm assuming he was a manager or supervisor of some sort). He behaved so strangely all night and could not take a joke. He was definitely not a people person and made me feel very uncomfortable. Thankfully our server was outstanding! I wish I could remember her name. The food was average. We had zucchini fries for an appetizer which were pretty good and came out piping hot! I ordered salmon, brussel sprouts and grits for my meal. The salmon was also pretty hot and so were the grits. Brussel sprouts were grilled and tasty but lukewarm at best. I did like the mix of music and they played quite a bit of new stuff. Next time I go I'll probably just do drinks and appetizers. I doubt I'll sit at the bar unless the grumpy guy is not behind the counter.",

Since I was in South End, I figured I would try again. BAD decision. We sat right away and then placed our order. We ordered a bottle of wine, pretzel bites and chicken wings. The server poured our wine without allowing a taste first. Our food was dropped off about a half hour later and our server said he would be right back with plates. Well, we never got plates nor did we see our server during our whole meal. Me and my date ate off the serving plate and had to put our chicken bones on the same plate. We were finished with our food and wine. We wanted some more wine, but we didn't see our server to order some more. After another 10 minutes, we asked for our check which was dropped off by the hostess. I am not one to complain, but I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and I expressed my disappointment. After he gave me 3 excuses and a half hearted \"sorry\" he walked away. This place needs a service makeover and lessons on customer service. There are way too many places to eat in the South End to deal with this. PS.. I have often eaten at the other Leroy Fox and have had great experiences every time.",

It wasn't because they were crowded it was just unorganized.  It took a long time with our service in general.  If it wasn't for the drinks and food being so good I would give a 3 star review.  It took us a little over two hours to get in and out with no wait.  I got the grilled shrimp wrap with a salad and it was incredible.  My friends ordered a kids cheeseburger, chicken wrap, and the breakfast sundae.  Everything was very good.  The food was fresh and had excellent flavor.  I was pleasantly surprised after waiting forever for my drinks.   At the end we had to ask for our checks twice and wait a while for those too.  If it wasn't for the slow service I would be a more frequent visitor.",

I have tried many things bean burger wrap, shrimp wrap, crab cake, and all of the sides and honestly - while the other options are still great - the chicken takes the cake! (Just prepare to wait 20 min because it is served hot and fresh) My personal favorite side is the Mac and cheese but the sweet potato tots (request extra crispy) and the green bean casserole are also good.",

It was busy but nothing too crazy. I asked the bartender's opinion on two cocktails and his response was, \"I only drink PBR.\" He then smiled and walked away- didn't offer to find someone who could help me or anything.   I ordered the Young George Washington cocktail (obviously decided on my own). It was basically like a smoked Manhattan. I was pleasantly surprised by this drink. It was boozy and delicious - just like a Manhattan should be.   For food I had the fried chicken sandwich with bacon, egg, and pimento cheese and a side of brussel sprouts. Chicken is what they do and it was very good. I've had better, juicier chicken sandwiches in Charlotte, but this was solid.   I'd come back. Seems like it has a bit of something for everyone.   Service leaves something to be desired, which seems to be a theme as I read these reviews.",

It's safe, you can enjoy great sightseeing and bonus win you get to take food breaks at places like Leroy Fox.   Walking in we were immediately greeted by the host and taken to the first available seats inside. We sat at the half round booth near the bar. Our server came out to greet and welcome us. He shared the specials for the evening and suggested a few of his favorites.  We started with the zucchini straws as an appetizer. We all were expecting them to be skinny, but they were nice large slices and had great breading in them. It was sort of spicy but not overwhelming and the two dipping sauces that they give you are great also.   Shortly after the appetizers came out, our meals were served. Timing was perfect, I like that we did not have to wait much longer for our entrees. Everyone said they loved the food, but the service from our server was outstanding. He was so personal able and remained engaged with us. I hate that I forgot his name {fail on my end and I said his name like a million time... grrr} but he made sure that we were well taken care of. Always checking in, refilling our drinks {that's huge deal for my Dad} and he even shared with my mom that if she didn't like her food option as she was a little uncertain that there was no problem with changing it. Thankfully she loved everything {lol} and we all were pleased with Leroy Fox South End and the service they provided. We most certainly will be back and I've already started raving to friends how they should try this place!",

Where the restaurant really starts to falter a little bit is definitely in the terms of how their service is like. I've got a lot of attitude from some servers over the past few times I've been there, and that's come with a lot of wrong orders that come out. And it takes a little bit more time then I'd like to get the right food to come back out, but like I said when it's right it's good, they just need to tighten up a little bit more about their service.",

It was fresh greens and vegetables , perfectly grilled chicken that came with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of buffalo vinaigrette ( very interesting twist on a vinaigrette).   I wasn't impressed by my Georgia Tractor mule ( peach infused mule with real peaches ), but I'm willing to go back and make my way through the specialty cocktail menu possibly for brunch. Yes brunch!

The outside patio is good from happy hour and day drinking on a nice day out. The inside can accommodate large groups. - It's located in South End in walking distance to mass transit, bars and other restaurants. You can even hoof it to Uptown, it's an easy trek.  Cons: - Service is kinda eh. We sat at the bar and service was lacking at best.",

    "text": "If a place has wings on the menu, it is usually a great place to start because it tells you a lot.   I am very particular about chicken wings. I get it...they are thought to be a simple menu item; therefore, also assumed as \"easy to prepare\". So, when I request crispy wings, I expect just that. The wings at Leroy Fox leave me majorly underwhelmed. I assume that this also has something to do with the fact that they showed up about five minutes after I ordered. Now, I'm no chef, but I can guarantee anyone that it takes more than 5 minutes to prepare crispy wings. I believe the wings were parboiled and finished on the grill. ALL the wrongs steps in my concept of a great wing.   The cocktail saved this review. The \"For Whom the Berry Tolls\" cocktail is amazing. Made with tequila, basil, blackberry and jalapeno, it is a perfect blend of sweet and heat. I noticed that the bartenders take a lot of time and attention with the cocktails. For this reason, I may return...and will update this review per a different experience.",

The service has improved every time - you can tell they're getting in the swing of things. As always, the food is delicious. I do hate that they've gotten rid of my favorite thing for Sunday brunch - the which came first. But their sandwiches are always wonderful, so are the sides & appetizers. I definitely suggest the zucchini fries or the pretzels if you want an app.",

But their cocktail menu is what gets me, they have so many amazing cocktails and the new plum one coming to the menu in April and the most delicious alcoholic beverage I've ever had in my life! Leroy Fox is a MUST!",

I tried the grilled chicken wrap, which was ok. The sweet potato tater tots were too sweet for my taste - on top of the naturally sweet flavor they also dust them with cinnamon. The wings have potential but were just ok IMO - I prefer my wings much more crispy than they serve them (this is even after we requested extra crispy). We'll definitely go back to try other items.",

Once we were actually seated, it took the waitress 15 minuets to acknowledge us, and we waited for our food for over an hour. The manager apologized for our wait and covered our check so I appreciated that. Overall, even though the manager tried to rectified the situation, I would not recommend this establishment.",

I will say the fried chicken with the seasoning on the breading was excellent. I would recommend this dish. The pimento cheese and pita appetizers were also excellent. However,  that is when things became average. The grilled blackened chicken was ok but I could have made that at home. The mac and cheese would have been amazing had the chef not dumped a full salt shaker into the cheese sauce. The green bean casserole was not impressive and would not recommend. The corn bread had great flavor but was dry. Overall this is a cool spot but I don't think I would go back for the food. Hanging out with some drinks would be good but would not return for dinner",

Just the perfect blend and I enjoyed it enough to order a 2nd one. The food came and was good too.  The bad: Not much to say on this category other than the fried chicken was very dry and the sweet potato was just that, sweet potato tots (expected something seasoned) but was not bad just not my expectation.  The ugly: the time it took to get the food for 4. That said, it usually means the foods coming would be excellent but the food was good at best.  4 star because the atmosphere and vibe added to the experience and the waiter was great. Service and vibe is the additional star so will I be back? Definitely...",

We were quickly seated and the restaurant is nicely decorated.  Our drink orders were taken and we have several questions about the menu which were sufficiently answered. Here comes the downside. After placing our orders, we waited a total of 35 minutes for our food to arrive. The hostess never came over with an update and when we asked about our food the response we were given is \"let me check on it\".   The food arrives. My fried chicken was hot but over cooked. The Brussel sprouts with bacon was hard, dry and very salty.  The cornbread was room temperature.  My friend ordered the chicken tenders with Brussel sprouts and her chicken wasn't seasoned at all. Her Brussel sprouts were hard and salty as well.   The hostess came over and asked about our meal and when we told her the Brussels were hard she offered to replace them with Brussels  but we declined. She didn't offer any other sides nor did she seem terribly interested in making us have a good dining experience.  When our checks arrived she did comp us 20% which made it a little better.   Looking at other reviews maybe our experience was just a one time thing. I hope so. I'd like to come back and try it again because the place is really nice but not too keen on the lackadaisical attitude of the wait staff.",

    "text": "Came here on a busy Saturday night with friends and were seated quickly. They have a small outdoor patio but we wanted to sit inside because of how hot it was outside.   We ordered the pretzel bites to start. They were warm and soft and came with two dipping sauces-- queso and a mustard sauce. Definitely better than the ones at Brass Tap.   I ordered the 1/4 South plate with mashed potatoes and gravy (on the side). It was pretty good but I think I will order something different next time.   My friend ordered the bread pudding for dessert. It was ginormous compared to the picture! I didn't try it but they said it was really good.   There were lots of families with small children so it seems to be a good family spot. I think later at night it feels more like a bar than a restaurant.",

Their zucchini bites and pretzel bites are stellar...Highly recommend. Moscow mules are cold and tasty with that good crushed ice - makes a difference! Getting it to-go isn't bad either but definitely smaller quantity the one time I got it. Parking was free up until last week in the deck and now I heard you have to pay such is a deterring factor for me, at least in getting it to-go. That's out of their control though. Maybe get lucky and get a street spot for free after 5.",

    "text": "I guess the old adage of anything worth having is worth waiting for is applicable to this spot. My friends and I decided to have dinner at Leroy Fox  Saturday night of All Star weekend 2019. We arrived around 8:30pm and the hostess advised me that the wait was 1 hour and 45 min. She apologized, assuming we would not want to wait. I told her it was fine, they typically over guesstimate the wait time!   We were told that the bar was first come first serve. We made the assumption that the communal  table  was included in bar seating. After speaking with  a few ladies seated at the table, they told us we could just sit, since that is what they did. However, a staff member told us that they are seating parties at the table from the wait list--- we were booted. We eventually found a decent place to wait and not feel that we were in the way! We ended up sitting at a table next to the patio area to wait on our table. Of note- as we were waiting there were multiple empty tables in the restaurant. Not sure  how they seat people, but I did find this to be interesting.   After about an hour and 15 min wait we were finally seated. Our table was behind the bar directly in front of two televisions.  Prime location to check out the All Star dunk contest! I will also add that the seats are very comfy! However, we noted that all of the people seated behind the bar were African American. Coincidence? Possibly, but just something that was observed.   Our server promptly greeted us and took our drink orders. Since we waited so long we needed no time to decide what we were having. I had the berry mule, chicken nachos and sweet potato tots! The food was prepared and delivered promptly. Was it worth the wait-- yes. I loved every bite of the sweet potato tots.  I am going to go ahead and say they are the best I have ever had. The nachos were a flavorful  combo of beans, chicken cheese and just yumminess!   I must also give kudos to our server! He was attentive, but not over the top. He did a great job!",

    "text": "An unexpected place to get good food in South End comes from Leroy Fox! This place was so crowded and I didn't understand why until I ate their food here!   So we came for a Sunday brunch but had the regular menu with their drink special for Sunday. The place has a nice atmosphere and televisions everywhere to watch the event of the day which happen to be the NFC championship.   We ordered the chicken with sausage gravy with a Mac and cheese side and the pimento cheese and egg chicken sandwich with the Brussels sprouts. Man the Brussels spouts were so good and light I could have literally have them for my entire meal! The chicken was so moist and delicious that I wasn't expecting it to taste as good as it did when I bite into it.   That is why I was easily surprise and felt like it was great service combined with good food. Everything came out in a timely manner even with the place being at full capacity!   Definitely coming back again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good place to eat!",

Yup you read that right !! Sweet tater tots  . They have a nice outside area that's covered and a projector that you watch during the day. The decor is by far amazing. This is the second location however it is modern and updated. Very local it stops right at the light rail. Street Parking was reasonable to locate. The bar seating is nice cushion seats not your average bar stools. They offer a brunch menu and the pricing overall is decently priced. I would come back if I'm every in the area.",

    "text": "I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good southern meal. I have been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner and it never disappoints.   For lunch/dinner I usually get the honey glazed chicken and two sides of Mac and cheese. The honey glazed chicken is amazing and great option for those who don't want to eat something fried. In addition, I personally cannot do the fried food due to allergies but my friends talk about how the fried chicken, tots, and fries are really amazing! The Mac and cheese is definitely one of the best items on the menu, and it's only a side. I get it every time I come and when I took my mom here, she said it was the best Mac and cheese she ever had.   For brunch, I either go with eggs benedict (without the crab because I'm allergic) or French toast with a side of hash browns. The French toast here is great! It has a cannoli filling that is unlike other places I personally have been, and while that can be a bit too sweet, I usually only ask for it on one side. Plus the mimosas are only $4 and properly made with mostly champagne with a dash of orange juice.   One thing to note, this place has little to no cell service inside. Helpful to keep you off the phone when you're out with friends but hard to text people you are meeting up with.",

I wish there was a little more buffalo on it but it was still amazing none the less.   There was a large crowd there for the football games but we were able to sit at the bar. For being extremely crowded the food did not take that long. On Sunday's they have mimosa and bloody marry drink specials. Both of the drinks were amazing and strong! They have many TV's throughout the entire restaurant so you can watch games anywhere you are sitting. I cannot wait to go back and try their brunch food and their fried chicken.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of the other Leroy Fox for years and the South End location offers the same great service and food. I like to describe the food as elevated comfort food. The best thing Leroy Fox is known for is their chicken and for me the best zucchini fries anywhere.   There's plenty of seating and an outdoor area where you can watch the rail go by. The decor is modern with a mix of seating (booths, chairs, high tops and the bar) and I love the striped linen napkins and floral pattern plates. At lunch, it wasn't super crowded and we were seated right away. They have a great drink menu, but we can't drink on our lunch breaks.   The menu offers appetizers, gourmet salads, many sandwiches and wraps, and meals like chicken tenders, shrimp and grits or chicken and biscuits. And the sides are the home cooked kind you crave at Thanksgiving. I ordered the honey buffalo grilled chicken sandwich with a side of those legendary zucchini fries with the boom boom sauce.It did not disappoint. Bun- brioche, perfect for the size of the sandwich. Chicken- tender, juicy and plenty of that honey buffalo sauce. Topped with sweet pickle and blue cheese - perfection. Now those zucchini fries. Giant spears breaded in chicken batter and fried. Pair that with a spicy sweet creamy boom boom sauce and you have a winning side. I dream about these things.   Glad to have a closer location I can get to from work with really awesome food!",

Our server suggested trying one of their signature drinks, that mirrored an old fashion. It tasted very well and the smoke that they use to display the drink was visually appealing .  I started with the shrimp and grits and my partner had the salmon salad. I will say that the vinaigrette that they use for the salmon salad was delicious. I believe it was a honey cilantro vinaigrette. I'm not sure how they made it but I would love to find out. My shrimp and grits was amazing and good I would highly recommend it.  They did have a bar area so if you're not coming into eat sitting at the bar and drinking as an option as well. I love the little fox pictures around the restaurant and made me think of the movie Mr. fantastic fox",

When I suggested for a booth that just needed to be wiped down she said that would work but also made us wait another 15 minutes to be seated after the table was cleaned. Jennifer cleaned it for us and was very nice and went ahead and got us waters for our wait. She also helped out a lot towards the end of our visit. She's great and so was our waitress April.

There isn't another bartender that even tries to do their job: consistent texting behind the bar, snappy comments, and updating social media accounts. We ended up standing up and flagging someone down after 10 min without someone checking on us. There were 5 bartenders at one point, and 3 of them were standing around talking with multiple people waiting on drinks. We've been going to the Leroy Fox on Sharon for 2 years now and recently been trying this location out. Very disappointed in the lack of effort by the bartenders (except for Chase) and the Mac n cheese. There is some added spice to the Mac n cheese here that they don't add to the dish on Sharon.  Also, they don't put on the sound for games here unless it's a Panthers game. No one wants to sit at a full bar on a Sunday listening to the top 10 of 2004 when football games are on.",

REALLY for ice tea!!!! I have eaten there and plenty of other places and never play for refills on ice tea...to pay $4.50 because I got refills makes no SENSE!!! It's not like it's any special tea.

My poor husband ordered salmon which was over cooked. When the food finally came out 2 of our sides were missing. When we got the sides they we're disappointing as well. The steamed broccoli was not good at all and tasted like burned butter. The manager took a small amount off of our check but the meal should have been at least half off.

The vibe is a little different here than at the other location though. It's a very open space with a patio that opens into the restaurant via a big garage door type window. We sat at a table inside near the bar and were seated right away on a Friday night which was nice. The space was slightly cramped with full tables all around us, but it didn't detract from the experience. There were also plenty of tvs, so it would be a great place to go on gameday.  I was trying to be healthy so I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad. I was very impressed with the size of it and I was so full that I barely finished it! The fried beets, avocados, and pickled red onions were plentiful on top of the bed of greens.   Drink-wise, the boo and I started with their Cucumber Basil Lemonade , which we thought was very refreshing and just the right hint of sweetness. Wanting to try something else, we then ordered another drink, the Alexa, and were not enthused as it did not have much flavor. We told the waitress and she asked if we wanted to change it out for the lemonade again.. we agreed and she also comped us the drink!  The service was great and the food was plentiful. I'm excited to come back!",

Cool Charlotte-specific wall art, which I always appreciate. Music inside was good- good music makes the atmosphere 10x better in my opinion. The bar was clean and they have lots of TVs, so I'm sure this would be a great place to watch the Panthers.   I got a buffalo chicken salad; my friend got the roasted beet salad. They were both excellent and a good size. Also- the sweet potato tots are probably the best in Charlotte.   Our service was great, she was attentive and nice.

I love the decorations and the place is large, which also makes it hard to hear when it's busy. What I loved most is that they have a small private room that you can reserve for larger parties.

We all just drank the water served but they said twice they would bring out the 6th glass that was missing. Finally had to ask another server. Dinner seemed to take an excessively long time.   Also they plated something incorrectly but they did fix it quickly.   I would give it another try just because of the food.",

So I went to the restroom and when I returned my wife was still standing still not acknowledged (FYI she was not wearing a green field jacket)    I couldn't help but asking the bartenders/servers, \"excuse me, are you guys open\" in my most sarcastic tone possible and it went right over her empty little head. I asked for some menus because no one in the restaurant knows how to greet customers apparently.   We took our own seats and studied the over priced menu for a few minutes before deciding we weren't giving our money to a restaurant like this. We grabbed our jackets and hit the exit!   You'd think they'd make an effort to find out why two customers are walking out before even ordering, but that would be giving them too much credit. This place flat out SUCKS! And the staff is inattentive and lack customer service skills.",

Some stuff could probably be done a little better but overall it's a good spot. They are best known for their chicken and I agree! Everything chicken wise I've had has been great. Bar menu also on point! Great spot!",

    "text": "I love the location of this restaurant.  Located on a chic side of town.  We arrived right before the crowd and got a great spot.  However, this place gets packed and it's not really a large place.  The bar sits in the middle and then you have the tables and booths surrounding it.  It was very noisy and the bar is very close to the tables so while some people were gathered around the bar waiting on their table, it seemed very crowded and small.  But nonetheless, we are here for the food.  So I signed up for their rewards program (which I highly recommend because you get to try their zucchini fries for free ---- I mean the breading was delicious and seasoned but unless you are a huge zucchini fan then I'm not sure these are for you, but for free, why not).  So I ordered the Shrimp Po boy and it was really good --- seasoning on point!  Their cajun fries were good as well.  My guy ordered the chicken buffalo sandwich and it was good and spicy with a side of sweet potato tots and the fact that I don't eat sweet potato fries/tots whatever, those were pretty darn good!!!  Lastly the folks ordered their famous chicken and again, it was the same batter on the chicken, shrimp and zucchini fries and when I tell you...it was finger-licking good. We didn't try their cocktails, but next time I will definitely order one and try something else on their menu but definitely thumbs up.",

I tried the shrimp wrap (with grilled shrimp) on a recommendation from our waitress. She did not steer me wrong, it is delicious! Their brussel sprout side is killer too.  As far as the brunch menu, my husband highly recommends the hash brown casserole. It's rich and decadent- the kind of thing you want to take a nap after but really should go work out for like 2 hours.  Our only complaint is service related. While all of our servers have been very nice, the coordination with the bar seems to constantly be an issue. We've been 3 times now and each time a drink was forgotten or took over 15-20 minutes to arrive. The cocktails are super yummy (champagne mojito!) If only you could consistently get them to your table.  To be fair, the servers have been very apologetic and immediately try tor make things right, but it seems something should be improved in their work flow.",

The mac and cheese was even good and I did not have high expectations about it when it got to the table. And the tollhouse dessert...can you see my eyes rolling in the back of my head? Homemade caramel sauce, perfectly baked warm cookie...my only complaint was I wish it were bigger. I was so impressed and wondering why it took me so long to get there! I can not wait to go back!

    "text": "I'ts really sad that I have to write this, but last night was my fourth and final visit to Leroy Fox southend location. I had previously posted and then deleted my review because I hate writing bad reviews (I have only every written one bad review on yelp) because I am a big believer in \"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\" But I feel like with my experience last night and as a fellow business owner that it's necessary. I absolutely love the food and the Cotswold location, but I feel like I've been left with a sour taste in my mouth and struggle to want to support this place any longer (not like they won't survive without my business) The first time my boyfriend and I visited LF Southend we were having drinks at the bar- service was a little slow, but we figured that since they were newly open, they were working out the kinks. Second time, service was just as slow, and our service was mediocre- we were waiting 20 minutes before being served drinks, and my boyfriend had ordered an entree only to have the side come out so late that he was done with his main portion. Sucks, but we said hey, if we have plans, we don't need to come here to eat. 3rd time I ordered food to go- I was able to finish 3 drinks at the bar before my food was finished, and even then, they thought they had messed up my order before I left.  All of these I can maybe put to the side but last night, my boyfriend and I stopped in after watching the football game (around 7pm). We were seated at a table and waited about 5-10 minutes and weren't approached. Mind you, the restaurant was not busy. We finally said forget it, then left. As we were walking away, a server stepped outside and yelled \"thanks for coming in!\" In what seemed like a very sarcastic tone. I had to ask my boyfriend if I was hearing things right but he also felt the same way about the comment. Why was this necessary? And even if it was genuine, it was a little too late to save face.   I really hate to say this, but I won't be returning to this location any longer. As a business owner in southend, I would often refer clients to this spot for lunch- but I won't be doing this either  Update/ I was reached out to by one of the managers of all of the locations after a client of mine who works there informed him of my review- he was kind enough to give me a very sincere apology and phone call and supplied my staff with lunch to make Amends. Thank you to Brandon for taking action and I hope to return to the southend location for a better experience. The food, as always, was great.",

The sausage was very flavorful without being too salty. The sandwich was very tasty but I think the fried chicken would have been a bit bland and dry if it weren't for the toppings. I'll have to go back to double check that . My husband got the buffalo fried chicken sandwich and he said it was great as well. We can't wait to try more of the menu here.",

I only got 4 in an order and they were massive! Although delicious, smaller fries would've made for a better bite. I love the decor here! Kind of artsy meets rustic, the mural on the wall is amazing and I enjoyed the overall look. My drink was spicy and had an awesome ice sphere in it with jalapenos frozen inside! I  definitely return.",

    "text": "I will never go to Leroy Fox SE again. This was our second time here and our experience was so bad it prompted me to write a review. Our first at the restaurant the appetizer didn't come out until after our meal. The manager came out and apologized and comped the app, which seemed appropriate. Second visit , we ordered an app and our meal at the same time. App came out no problem but we sat there for 40 minutes after the app came out and no meal. I mentioned something to the server and the management addressed by doing absolutely nothing. The Meal finally came out, mind you we ordered one entree and 2 sides, it was decent food but the wait was inexcusable. The table beside us had sat after us and had already finished their food and cashed out by the time we got ours. My guess is they don't really care about returning customers so I'll bring my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "The star rating is for service. The food there is excellent! I've eaten in the restaurant and called ahead to pick up an order and every time my meal was amazing. They need to do a much better job training their staff. It seems like they turn over servers every 3 month. In addition, the servers get quickly overwhelmed and forget to check on your table or orders seem to take way longer than they should. When I sit at a table, I would totally drink more if the server was attentive and checked up when my drinks are empty. I also always order ranch with the sweet potato tots... they have their own sauce that they serve. But imo they're WAY better with ranch! And every time the kitchen forgets to include my ranch. Well... one time they remembered. But that's because I was sitting at the bar. You get much better service sitting and eating at the bar.  The bartenders are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and they don't seem to have as high of a turnover rate.",

Been here multiple times for the great food but service always falls short and turns what could be a great experience into less desirable. Bartenders will look at you with acknowledging you and take forever to take your drink order. Servers and food always extremely slow. Def needs improvement",
