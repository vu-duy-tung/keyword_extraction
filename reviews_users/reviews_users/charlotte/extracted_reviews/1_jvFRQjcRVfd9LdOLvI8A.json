The seats are comfortable and the old wood work is quite pleasing to the eye. Some of the bartender ladies have a slight Celtic accent, which can just make your heart melt.  I have never eaten here, so I can't speak as the quality of the food. Though from the looks of it, they food is made rather well. What I can speak of is their excellent array of whiskeys. Several great aged scotches and bourbons to choose from and some great beers to partner with.  Ri Ra is a great place to have a nice relaxing drink of whiskey and taken in a football (soccer) game.",

The food came quick but no potato soup. Instead I got a chicken chilly soup and was told they had no potato soup. I would have liked him to tell me before instead of just bringing something else that I might not even like without even asking me if it was ok or if I would like to order something else.   The food was ok but the soup wasn't really an appropriate portion for its price after already getting something else than I expected.   The service itself wasn't to great either. We had a group of people and you would expect him to take everyone's order at the same time but everyone had to call him individually to place a food order which caused everyone to eat at a different time and in the end people still didn't get their food until we almost had to leave again.",

Stale whole wheat bread, nasty, slimy, processed turkey - the cheap stuff that seems pressed together from regurgitated poultry. They don't post prices anywhere in the shop, so you're buying blind. So stale bread, 2 inedible pieces of turkey, a bag of chips, a pickle spear and a cup of water cost me $10.01. Threw most of it out. I will not be returning. My lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything. Find another lunch option if you care about taste and price.",

With the World Soccer match with the U.S.A. fighting to stay in the game, the bar was both packed and loud....but with the TVs turned up as loud as they could go, our little group didn't stand a chance to have some engaging conversations.

Usually my group of friends show up early enough (right when dinner is ending) and the bar transitions into night mode so we always miss a cover (if there is one)... The coziness of the upstairs makes for a great experience.  One bad thing to mention was the staff... we were ordering drinks and it seemed like it was taking forever.  Yes, it was starting to get crowded, but it seemed like our server favored certain groups of people - maybe an assumption on my part, but it was based on attire and maybe how much tip she would anticipate getting from the group.... Later when we were all ready to go a close our tabs, we basically had to recite our drink orders to her since she didn't even bother to keep track for us.  Outdoor deck upstairs is great in the summertime, but now that they banned smoking in the bars (hooray!) it turns the deck into a smokers haven at times.",

No I'm not a fan of the super crowded nights when crazy drunken young men can get into fights just because the other person took a breath.    Recently I went there with a group of friends on our little 5th Street bar crawl night.  And I have become a fan of their curry fries!    Something addictive about a box of HOT fries mixed with a sweet yet savory curry sauce.  I don't think it's because it's late night and we've been drinking... or that I didn't have dinner (though I'm sure it has something to do with it), but I think I licked the box!   I'm not sure how curry fries are Irish, but I'm glad someone think that they are.",

I got the reuben, which was awesome, and not heavy or greasy.  Mom got the chopped salad which was also great.  We sat on the upstairs deck area and people watched.  It was pretty cool.  The weather was great as was our server.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more food, like the curry fries and fish n chips.  Granted, I probably won't be able to be back for a few months, but still, the food is great.",

They have a great patio which does not catch the sun early in the morning, making it perfect for brunch on a warm summer day.  Try the wings.  They have a slight tartness but are also smokey and a little chard.  On our last visit we had brunch- the sausage and egg boxty and Irish Benedict.  Both dishes were suburb, as was the service.  The previous evening, we hung with the upstairs bartender before a concert next door.  Great service there as well  They host an Irish session on Sunday nights-  So happy to see an Irish themed pub making an effort by supporting local Irish musicians.",

There are things on the menu I that are good and there are things that aren't.   The Baked Goat Cheese ($10.95) - Okay this is yummy. But it's an appetizer...and it's $11. But it's goat cheese, but it's an appetizer.....but it's good, so get it anyway. This I enjoyed and would've ate it by the boat load.  Publican's Reuben ($10.95) -('o'-) Oh my gosh look at that. My Reuben was the same price as my dang appetizer!  Haha. The Reuben was sadly not that great, the bread was soggy, and it was missing some more much needed sauerkraut. It just didn't have the tang or crunch I was looking for. The meat was a bit dry and bland as well.  My friend had the Fish & Chips Regular portion ($13.95). He said they were good, but could've been crispier. I'm not sure if the batter was exactly his favorite.  The first time I went to Ri Ra's with a group I had the Guinness BBQ Burger ($10.95) I liked this - yummy onion rings and Guinness BBQ sauce on top.  So overall - okay food good vibes. I'd probably give it another shot, just keep me away from the Goat Cheese!",

The inside is very dim/dark lit and that added to all of the wood used everywhere to both decorate the bar, walls, tables makes it feel very much \"pub\" like.   While they do try and sell the traditional irish fair of Fish and Chips, Shepards pie and such I gotta admit that as much as I like this place the food could be a little better. It just feels like for the dollar amount you have to put forth (usually are 20$ a plate for dinner) you would be getting a little better quality. Also, the drafts of Guinness run at around $5.25 a piece so they are for sure running at premium price. Still though, despite its few shortcomings I would always recommend this place for a chill place to hang out and have some Guinness.",

The decor...the interior...the layout...pretty damn nice.  The bar and layout is exacty what I expect from a traditional Irish pub.  For a narrow layout anyhow.  The bar itself is about as authentic as you can get.  Very nice!  The atmosphere is nice when you're here early and bellied-up.  The patio is also nice for enjoying the evening.  Weekend nights...just say no!  The crowd is a grab-bag of disappointment.  Which leaves us with the food...it's food.  If it's late...and you paid the cover...and you're hungry...go ahead.  If you're not at Ri Ra, and you're hungry...there are many other fine options.  Try: Some Tullamore Dew neat  Avoid: Weekend nights",

If you are looking for an authentic Irish pub this is the one! Everyone that works there is straight out of Ireland and could not be more welcoming. My friend and I could've stayed all day chatting with each of the bartenders we met. Ray and the others were all fantastic! Recommended great beers for our tastes as well. They have your Irish beers as well as local beer. Also have liquor and wine. The place itself makes me feel like I'm back in Dublin with its detail. It's upstairs has live music at night sometimes and the patio is pretty nice if you're lucky enough to go there when the weather is appropriate.",

No one was uptown and the place was completely empty. We told the hostess we were there to drink. She said..\".OK, Make yourselves at home\".  I told my friends what i wanted to drink, stepped away to the bathroom, returned to find all of my friends standing. I asked what was going on...they said that the Hostess came over and told them that the table was reserved and that we had to move to the bar. Really? Reserved for who? Uptown was completely empty, their bar was empty...they were making NO money.   We decided to leave and go to Rockbottom because we didn't want to sit at the bar...we wanted a table.   As we were walking out, I told the hostess that \"it was too bad that they were missing out on the bar business\". Her response was.....\"Oh, that's OK\". Then she proceeded to make other remarks as we were walking out the door. Unfortunately, we didn't bother to stick around and listen to the rest of what she had to say.    What a way to represent Charlotte and your Establishement, RI, Ra.  Word of advice....FIRE YOUR HOSTESS WITH THE BAD ATTITUDE...and INCREASE YOUR PROFITABILITY!

What does impress me is when a server actually does record my order, and everything comes out how I ordered it... Tonight I had a fairly simple order however I asked for salad dressing on the side.. Low and behold, my salad came out slathered with dressing. My boyfriend asked for sweet potato fries yet was delivered regular fries as a side. Aside from that, our server failed to ask if we wanted another round of drinks, yet when he finally did ask, our second order of drinks came out 10 minutes later. What truly was upsetting was that the bartenders were too preoccupied with the televised soccer game to help out the server. Crappy service = crappy tip and a crappy yelp review. Try again fellas.",

It's a great place to get lunch or dinner if you like the Irish pub experience, but don't attempt to get that experience on a weekend night.  You should be warned that the atmosphere changes drastically after the 9 o'clock hour.  The place gets packed on the weekends for the live music, with many young collegiates upstairs looking for potential mates and swarming in unbridled testosterone. Rira's has good cover and local bands, in which case they charge $5-$8 cover.  Don't get wrong, this can be fun in small doses.  Outside of these times, its usually a sedate, older white collar crowd that frequents this place.   Food wise-the burgers are always a good bet and the portions are quite generous.  I've had the sheperd's pie before, it definitely a \"stick to your ribs\" dinner.  Most entrees are in the $10-$20 range.  The bevvy selection is varied and lean towards British/Irish varieties. The staff are congenial, though hurried on every occasion I've been.  Rira's is a good bet among Uptown restaurants, but nothing that warrants a 5-star review.",

Not bad for lunch though.  I just found out that it is a chain.  While I am surprised it does make sense  since everything in Charlotte tends to be a chain.

I called ahead to make sure they were serving fish and chips that day (they only serve it if the catch of the day is up to their standards) and they were. The beer selection is really great-- we decided to get the trio of Irish beers featuring Harp, Swithwicks, and Guinness.  We started out with a half order of wings with a Jameson honey glaze. The wings were perfectly cooked and the glaze was really excellent. My boyfriend and I both ordered the fish and chips which were fresh and delicious with a crisp and delicious crust. Even though we were incredibly full, we saw the table next to us order a dish full of what looked like chocolate mousse and immediately told our waitress we wanted that for dessert. It was a Bailey's chocolate mousse with whipped cream on the top. It was a HUGE serving, perfect for sharing and definitely fulfilled our chocolate craving. In addition to the food, the atmosphere was really cool and the service was fantastic. Our waitress had a lot of great suggestions and seemed very knowledgeable of the menu.   I will be heading back to Ri Ra very soon to try some Guinness stew or a traditional Irish breakfast!",

The bar is well stocked and has all the items you would expect from an Irish Pub.  They have a pretty good beer selection as well which is nice to see.  The food is pretty good but typical to what other irish places serve.  (Fish and chips, sheperd's pie etc).  The sheperd's pie is great though and i get it just about every time i come here.",

On weekend's they'll have a cover, but this is offset by the lack of a bathroom attendant, so the overhead expense for going out here is in line with the rest of downtown Charlotte.  The prices of drinks are probably a bit higher here, so you may wish to get a base going before you find yourself here.  The bartender was pretty nice to me.  I used an iPhone app with a drink database to order a random obscure cocktail and \"Irish Twist\".  She had no idea what it was but made it for me using the iPhone recipe, injecting some uniqueness into my Ri-Ra's experience.  And it may have just been the Irish Twists handling my perceptions, but I'm pretty sure she liked me.",

Downstairs is usually more subdued with its True Irish-pub feel. Upstairs is dark and slightly clubby. Both offer live music that usually cuts off at a certain hour to let a DJ play (top 40s and fun classics- seldom electronic or techno). The best part though, is the porch, which offers a beautiful view of three Uptown giants surrounding the bar- Bank of America tower, Hearst Tower, and the Fifth Thirds building. When the weather is nice and you've got to be outside, you can't beat it.  And a tip for a busy night- use the bathrooms outside, they're always vacant.",

I was pleasantly surprised to find it much to the liking of a Subway but refined and truly fresher ingredients.  The service was ok, not really over excited to serve but I imagine that's because this place gets really packed so they stick to the business at hand.  I got there around 11:30am and any later I would have been in line with about 20 other people.  This place gets packed!  Of course a couple other good things about this location is that if the weather is good there isn't a much better patio for eating then right there outside, out front of Hearst Tower.  Also they have a loyalty card which is always a good thing!",

Most of the good times were due to the band playing, which is sometimes really good, and most of the bad times were a combination of bad music and overcrowding.  This place has been a popular mainstay of downtown/uptown as long as I can remember.  It's tall and long inside but very narrow, and when its crowded it can offer up a bit of a claustrophobic vibe.  Since its so popular, it can draw a bit of an unruly, late-night crowd as well. Most of the people here are cool however, and the staff seem to be nice and accommodating.   Still, its hard to get a beer or drink, and I usually don't spend more than an hour or two here before bailing for more comfortable confines.  I can't speak to the food, as I've never eaten here. I have seen a menu though, and it looks decent, and decently priced.",

Drinks are okay if you can get someone's attention at the bar, or even get to the bar in the first place.  Service is usually pretty good - when it's busy they're a little harder to get ahold of.

When my burger came out, it was not a portabello mushroom patty, but instead, a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \"Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.  Now I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume, after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, that the manager, regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me, or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business. But no, instead, he stuck w/ his server, made an unhappy customer, and now I will not visit there on my own volition (my wife enjoys the place, so I will go back w/ her, only urging).",

Our server appeared very disinterested.  The tables near us were getting the same treatment, overhearing comments of \"what's her problem?\" after she appeared exasperated when she was asked menu questions.  Sure, they were busy, but they weren't packed to the gills (there were open tables).  Mainly, it was the lack of attention.  After our drink and dinner order, our appetizer arrived with our entree - then that was it.  The server saw a few tables near us, but never returned to our table despite our beers being empty for a while.  45 minutes after our food arrived, we finally get to order round #2 - which took 30 minutes to get to us.  For beer.  Several other tables near us were walking to the bar to get their drinks.  Needless to say, I tipped poorly compared to normal.  Probably won't be back - they aren't the only Irish pub in town.",

Ordered food and asked for extra plates cause there were 4 of us, never got them. Had to keep asking for refills on all of our drinks over and over again.  The 1 bartender filled our cocktail 3/4 of the way, i had to ask for more redbull in the drink to top it off and he huffed at me. The food was very good but the bar tending service was awful.",

    "text": "Not my favorite place in Charlotte, but not the worst either. We came here on one of the three snow days CMS had a few weeks back. There weren't many people which was nice, but surprising since everyone was off!   The menu was what I expected, a typical Irish pub menu. I couldn't really find anything I was in the mood for and either could my boyfriend. We ended up just getting an order of French fries which were surprisingly really good. The prices seemed a bit high for what was served. Even though we were hungry, we stopped at the fries because of the prices. I noticed the drink prices were a bit steep as well. I actually didn't have anything to drink because of that. My boyfriend had a few beers and bought a round of car bombs for his friends (10$ each-again pretty pricey) and the tab was about 50$.   The inside was nice, pretty dark but definitely had the feel of an Irish pub. I will say the service was great. Or server was very attentive and personable. We actually ended up seeing him out at the next bar once he was off his shift and we had a great time hanging out with him for a bit! Overall not a bad place to hang out with friends and have a few drinks, but not my top pick in Charlotte which has so many other places that offer better prices/drink specials/food.",

    "text": "\"Potatoes and stew!! Guiness, Jameson, and did I mention potatoes?!\" Haha. We all love Irish culture, don't we? I mean I remember the green fellow who used to make me chase after rainbows looking for a pot of gold wgen I was a kid. Seriously, I ran like the wind.   Enough intro though. Ri Ra is a great place for everything. I first went there with my formwe boss and mentor for lunch. I didn't think I'd like it because I always walked passed it thinking it's more of a drinking, pub kind of a place. Oh, boy was I wrong. Everything was so good. The second time I went was for a friend's birthday party. She was a Cullen. So where else would we go right? And that experience confirmed my assumption that it's a good place to party.  Now, last Saturday, I found out that it's a great place for a date with the significant other, too. She loved it. I mean, happy wife, hapoy life, right? She was born in Europe so anything that Europe-like will imoress her. The fact that it's laid back type of place (and not the snobby places I usually like) also made her like it. But hey, we go there to eat and drink, right? Well, they hit it right out of the park with her basic beef burger, my NC grass fed beef stew with Guiness, the fries, and of course, beer!  We chose the dessert wasn't exactly her style because she likes soft, creamy browines but theirs was a bit dry. Maybe it's an Irish thing. But hey I eat anything (except apples). Oh, the rye bread!! How did I leave this till the end. We thought it was one of the best we had. And the butter that comes with it were real Irish. So good job all around impressing us. Thanks.",

Our waiter got my husband's drink wrong.  He never came to see how were doing, to re-fill our drinks.  I had to flag the manager down to ask for mustard and ketchup for the burger.  The waiter can't use the excuse he was busy, because he checked on the table  behind ours FOUR TIMES while we never got any attention.  The couple next to us left because they never got waited on and looked really irritated, understandably!    How hard is it to mess up a cheeseburger?  That was one of the WORST burgers I've ever had.  No flavor.  Terrible.  When my husband tried to complain about the lack of service, the waiter got an attitude and was all defensive.  The manager didn't really seem to care.    You've lost a customer, Ri-Ra, and I think we deserved better.",

    "text": "So it has been a while since I have been to Ri Ra's and now I remember why.   We stopped in for drinks and appetizers, for a going away party for a collegue at work. We arrived shortly after 5:00pm and were able to grab two tables in the back, which was nice.  With more than 10 people we required a server, to sit at the table. That seemed good, rather than having to order each drink at the bar.  However, our server was taking care of every other table in the back room and drinks at the bar so he was hard to find. Most of use decided to order our next drink half way through our first since we knew it would take a while to see that next drink.  As for food, they no longer offer happy hour specials so we ordered a few appetizers off of the menu, potato cakes, poutine, cajun crab cakes, fried pickles among a few. And, all were nothing to write home about. The poutine actually came with raw french fries of which we had to send back. And the gravy, that typically is poured over the fries, sat the bottom of the bowl and tasted like gravy out of the packet, thank you McCormick's for letting Ri Ra use your gravy mix...Nasty!  As for the drinks, steer clear of the martini's, $12 for something the size of shot glass. Not worth it.  I will give credit to the fact that they did split each check and they were all correct. Overall, great atmosphere to get together with friends but not my first choice and not sure I would return anytime soon.",

It's an Irish pub that serves really good food.  The decor is not too upscale, but it's also not a po-dunk place that you would be ashamed of using as a meeting place for someone new.    I had the traditional English breakfast which had some really nice and authentic black & white pudding while J-Dubs had a burger that was bigger than her face and needed 3 hands to grapple.  Needless to say, there was so much food that we ended up taking it back.  The important thing was that it was tasty.  They have a fine assortment of adult beverages as well.    Also the poutine is quite authentic from what I've been told, and it was the first time that I was able to try this Quebecois dish.  The gravy was savory and the cheese was decadent.  Some sprouts on top added a splash of color and irony.   Our waiter Ray was a cool dude, fresh out of Ireland, he was able to entertain and regale us throughout the night with his stories and random old-world European knowledge of this little former English colony of North Carolina.",

    "text": "This week's Excited about Eating is headed to Uptown Charlotte to visit Ri Ra Irish Pub. When we walked into this restaurant, it felt like we were walking into a pub in Ireland. Our server told us that the interior was transported from Ireland and restored into its existing condition.  We started with the Potato Cake appetizer, pan seared potato and cheddar cakes served with savory sour cream and a balsamic reduction. The Potato Cake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. On the downside, it was loaded with onions and only served lukewarm. Dora here, Good thing we didn't stop there. :)  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, made with minced lamb, gravy, peas, carrots, and leeks served with a mashed potato crust and a slice of brown bread. The term \"shepherd's pie\" is used when the meat is lamb; the theory being that shepherd is connected to sheep and not cattle. This was an outstanding dish. The lamb and vegetables were perfectly cooked and full of favor with just the right amount of liquid, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with a nice crust. Dora here, I'm always game for Shepherd's Pie, and this was the first I've tasted with lamb. Thankfully, hubby shared with me or I might've resorted to stealing his fork. Soooo good!   My wife chose the Ri Ra Burger, topped with Ashe County cheddar, country ham, brown sugar onions and a Brioche bun. This burger was tall, juicy, and almost too big for the mouth. The caramelized brown sugar onions were sweet, and the garlic mayo added a unique taste. The \"Chipper \" chips are actually thick cut fries. I snagged a few and enjoyed dipping them in the garlic mayo. Dora here, This was a messy burger, but oh so yummalicious! And I probably drank a gallon of their iced tea.  I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. If I included the less-than-thrilling appetizer, I'd lower my rating to 4 forks.  ~Ernie Hiers, Food blogger at Fiction Faith & Foodies",

The Irish bartenders are nice to look at too.  The potato latkes were amazing as always. You get two in an appetizer portion. One of them was a little overdone on one side but still great. My boyfriend loved the Guinness and kept saying how long it had been since he had real Guinness. Even this morning, he said that was his favorite place that I've taken him to so far.",

Our waitress was actually from Dublin :)  They have a fairly large beer list, a lot of which are on tap. For dinner, I had the Irish breakfast, and it was one of the best I've ever had. The rashers were actual Irish rashers, not the greasy strips of regular bacon you get at a lot of other places. It was a ton of food and for a really great price!  We also got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was super creamy and cheesy- I'd definitely recommend it!",

If Ri Ra was near my office in Chicago, it would be packed at lunch time.   The hostess and server were both extremely nice. The hostess told me that all the wood and furnishings were brought over from Ireland when Ri Ra was built. It's a pretty big place, 2 floors, with a large bar and lots of tables.   I was craving a burger but I had been told that I should have brisket while in Charlotte. Since I always do what I'm told, I went with the Wiltshire Patty, a delicious brisket sandwich. The brisket was very good, but the sweet potato tater tots were even better. Sweet potato tater tots. I'm now on a mission to find some of these in Chicago.   Friendly service and sweet potato tater tots, what more can you ask for?",

This burger is the biggest thing I have ever eaten in one sitting! But, oh my, it was tasty. The kind of clog your arteries good. I don't think I needed to eat again that day.

    "text": "My friend had Sheppard's Pie and I had a great Burger with Onion Rings, Red Onion, Ri Ra BBQ Sauce and I threw away the bun fo fun and I'm on a diet, so I say.  First we had Potato Cakes and wow they were good.  This is a fun place!  It  exudes Charm and though I would not call it Romantic I do not know why I would not!  We were here last week and wanted to stay, though wound up at Vapiano, so all week I kept thinking when are we going back to Ri Ra, I only took a week.  Few places have such charm that I believe influence my enjoyment of the food.  Ri Ra seems to be one of those places!   Our server, a girl who lived in California was great!  They were staring to play trivia as we were finishing.  We were glad to be finishing!   More on food:  I always enjoy a few bites of a good Shepard's Pie though I would never want more than a few bites!  This one is the best I've tasted 4.0 yelp stars.  My burger  mmmmm 4.1 stars. Ri Ra BBQ Sauce 4.9 stars, Fries (someone loved them) 3.2 stars.  The Bread was a dark, thick, hearty, fresh wonder (looked like Chocolate Cake) 3.89 stars.  Onion Rings 3.2 stars.  Potato Cakes are hard to rate, I've had them in Brit Pubs, Irish Pubs and German Restaurants, these were very good, maybe 4.85 stars or better and they were served with sour cream and balsamic.  Nice Touch!  For dessert we had the very disappointing Special Irish or Baileys Chocolate Mousse and the slightly better Flour less Chocolate cake.  I'll rate the Cake 2.89 yelp stars, I had two bites and though neither of us liked it that much and my friend doesn't even like Chocolate someone cleaned the plate.  This Dessert was after the meal!  I would go back and get the Leak Soup, though it was Soup of the Day and I would check out the Fried pickles and see what else might look good!",

Ri Ra is a very cozy pub adorned with field stone, vintage Irish signage, and dark wood setting a welcoming tone and making you feel as if you are back in the \"old country\".  I was also surprised to have a server that was from Ireland take our order, she was of course charming and accommodating, exactly what you would expect. My husband and I popped in to catch a rugby match and the atmosphere was fantastic. They have giant movie screen with surround sound and the place was filled with Irish fans, my husband was thrilled (I wish I could say the same for the outcome of the match!). We ordered a few Guinness, of course... Which were all fresh, tasty, and poured correctly.  My husband had the lamb sliders, with red onion, curried mayo and goat cheese. The mini burgers were deliciously unique and cooked to perfection.  I opted for a chopped salad that had everything you could want, grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, red onion. The salad was lightly dressed and with two rustic slices of brown soda bread and Kerry Gold butter, it was a very generous portion. Very tasty and bonus points for the butter.  Because we were watching the match I decided to finish off the meal with an Irish coffee.  Which can be risky... They actually serve it the correct way!  Coffee, Irish Whiskey (Powers was my choice), sugar and fresh cream. Simple, and delicious!  I will definitely be coming back now that the weather is changing to try some stew and of course another Irish coffee.",

Friday night looking for a place uptown that isn't 'clubby' and offers a nice atmosphere for a pint...go to thought, \"an Irish pub\". Should be low key and on the 'quieter side', right? WRONG!   This place was half empty at 12:00 on Friday. They had some live music - great love Irish folk music, but unfortunately they were blasting 90's iconoclastic tunes and country. What? You're an Irish Pub? Not only did the music not fit the 'vibe', but it was way too loud. Who are you singing to that loudly? The place is empty, turn it down.   Asked a waiter where everyone was and he said there was a DJ/nightclub area upstairs. Great, thanks for not putting it in the pub area itself...the country music was bad enough, but again confusion. If I wanted loud country music I would have went to one of the many rowdy country bars in the city.   The bartender was also not friendly. Attempted to make conversation and he pretty much blew me off. My friend asked to start a tab, bartender then brought the check which later caused a bit of a hassle when he tried to order a second drink.   Ri Ra's was great before the fire, but now it is defiantly on my list of places not to go whilst uptown. Maybe the afterwork scene is a bit different, but late night was atrocious.",

Their menu is pretty much the classic Irish menu you would find at any Irish pub. They have a decent selection of beer and cocktails, which is a plus. Food is good, nothing special tho. I'm not big fan of their burger, so I usually go with the Shepard pie, or fish and chips. The pie is great, and fish and chips are amazing! Worth a try!  In conclusion, RiRa is a good place for a drink and a bite especially if you're soccer fan since they always stream EPL on weekends",

Several people in my group complained about their drinks & food not tasting well. I ordered the Top Chop Saald...it is a sad excuse for a salad. Hardly any chicken or avocado on the salad. The waitress was not attentive and had zero people skills. I left starving and paid way too much for sub par food, drinks & service. The manager actually came over & asked how everything was and I informed her of our problems. She did not comp anything or try to make up for the bad experience. Needless to say, I am not going back.",

We were quickly greeted by a genuinely friendly hostess. I love people who are really happy to see you. Fake smiles.....well anyway....hostess was very nice and friendly. Sat quickly with a great view....the bar. The selection of beer and spirits is pretty good. Prices were fair for market location.   Our server, Lovely, was great. Yep that's her name. She Listened to us. Answered questions and was prompt. So great on customer service.   The food was excellent. I had the Irish Curry Chicken and the better half had Fish and chips. Portions were more than adequate. Taste was very nice with great flavors. We both had a few drinks and those were swell. So good on quality.   The prices were very reasonable for being downtown Charlotte. Very pleased. The whiskey list had some good choices with a few that I felt over priced, but that is my opinion.   So over all I give 4 stars. Would have been 5 but I didn't see anywhere that said it was kind of a sports bar. Soccer was on and a few patrons were overly excited causing a little more noise than I would like when dining. A little sign might help just prepare my brain. Otherwise great job.   BTW. We got a 10% discount for going to the Spectrum Center tonight to see Bruno. Bonus!!   Cheers! Or should I say Slainte!",

    "text": "Unfortunately I need to update my glowing review. On a Monday night a friend and I were craving bar food so I led her to riras as I love(d) the food. However, the burger that I raved about in my last review is no longer on the menu :( it looked like there was only one or two burgers left. My friend ordered wings and I ordered a veggie burger with sweet potatoes fries. My friend's wings were pretty puny but she said they tasted fine. She ordered Brussels on the side and she said they were very bland. My veggie burger was good on the inside but the bread was hard (maybe stale). My sweet potato fries were cold and burnt. The best part of my meal was the magners. I'm really sad this place didn't provide us the delicious food I used to the last few years.",

The bartender was in the front bar with what appeared to be some regulars and went out of his way to ignore us.  We stood at the bar for 7 minutes before we left and went to Connolly's about 100 yards around the corner (where we were treated well and drank a few rounds).  For those of you counting that was 20-30 pints we ordered and tipped on.  I hope the barkeep at Ri Ra continues to work the Super busy Tuesday night shift and slowly put them out of business.  I hope the owner reads this and is offended by his staff. I have 20+ years in the bar business and I can explain how \"cool\" his regulars think his barkeep is (he probably complains how shit tips are on Tuesdays). I should also say the hostess was very sweet and understanding as we left. Good luck and just go to Connolly's.",

Now we just came from dinner, but I'm always up for an excuse to order more food so we agreed.  But the table wasn't even close to the fireplace.  Really couldn't feel a thing.  We ordered four appetizers and the mac and cheese.  Honestly, the most impressive thing was the curry sauce on the chicken sliders (which probably came from a pre-made packet, if we're being honest with ourselves here).  The mac and cheese was runny, the potato cakes fell apart and had a weird texture internally, the experimentalist sliders were dry, the spinach and artichoke dip didn't taste at all like spinach or artichoke, and the brussels sprouts were undercooked.  I had a cider, but everyone else ordered a warm drink, including a hot cocoa--these seemed to be a hit given the goal of warmth.  It was pretty cool that they had a live band (of two) rocking it on stage, including a mandolin and a cover of Hallelujah.  It was difficult, though, to get our server to pay any attention to us after the food came out.  We didn't get asked about a second round of drinks, we had to ask multiple times for containers to pack up the food, and it took forever to get the check.  I still like the place, but I'm not able to call this visit a win.",

I was even more excited to see our amazingly hot waiter with his amazingly awesome Irish accent (so authentic!).  The ambience was sorta cool, with this totally traditional vibe to it. Granted we were an extremely large group, but the customer service sorta sucked (the server to our side of the table forgot my sweet potato fries and wanted to bring them out as I was finishing my food). I ordered the pulled pork sliders, and those were pretty good, as was the side of potato salad that came with it. I just wish my fries had come out as well, because they looked amazing on someone else's plate...  ohhhhh welll... guess i'll have to go back again next time!",

Additionally we were seated at a table that was super awkward-- legs made sliding into the booth cumbersome. Decent service.

She wasn't the only poor server---after our meal, we went upstairs to check out the whiskey room, but it was practically deserted. We stood around for several minutes and there was no bartender or server to be seen. As if to emphasize the staff's lack of concern, we discovered that the satisfaction survey with our bill had already been filled out by a previous customer!

Ending up eating at the bar.  Speaking of the bar - the drinks were pretty weak.  I literally wondered if I was drinking watered down bourbon because I didn't taste a tone of ginger OR bourbon in my bourbon and ginger.  The highlight was the food, at least mine.  I got the brisket sandwich and fries.  The brisket was very tender and everything had good flavor.  I asked for a side of the curry sauce and I do not kid or exaggerate to say it is out of this world good.  If they had sold it in to go containers, I would have bought some to take home.  My friends both got the Reuben and described it as somewhat chewy.  I don't think I've ever had a \"chewy\" Reuben, so that wasn't very promising.  So, in any case, \"a-ok\".

    "text": "I just went through the line at the sandwich shop in the courtyard of the Hearst Tower.  The sandwich/ salad makers were polite and fast, and the price was reasonable for downtown.  The salad looks like it could be good, but there is no way for me to know because they were out of utensils.   How can a place that makes salads to go be out of utensils?  And the worst part is that you don't know it until you already through the line and have paid.  They should let people know before they pay.  The guy at the register made no apology or attempt to find some way to provide something to eat with.  Now sitting at my desk with a salad that I can't eat, gotta give it one star for the poor service.",

They had some very creative small plate offerings, partnered together with some very solid traditional Irish fare.  There is certainly something here for everyone. The restaurant/pub has a lot of charm to it, and you can definitely tell the folks who run this place take great pride in caring for their customers and representing their heritage in the food they serve.  My wife and I real liked the fried Ruben sliders, the shepherds pie, and the potato and leak pancake chicken wrap.  I look forward to coming back.",

    "text": "AWFUL EXPERIENCE. Went for brunch at 1:45 PM on a Sunday on St. Patrick's day weekend. I made my reservation via open table. When we arrived, there was nobody working as a hostess. We were greeted after 5 minutes of waiting by a waitress who bluntly asked \"how many?\". We waited another 5 minutes for them to clear off a table so we could be seated. Once we sat down we waited 10 minutes for a waitress to ask what we wanted to drink. I placed an order for a beer and my girlfriend did not know what she wanted at the time and wanted more time to decide. When the waitress finally came back 10 minutes later, she asked what I wanted to drink again (having not brought my beer) and I had to place my order again and my girlfriend ordered a drink as well. Fast forward 15 minutes- we finally received our drinks and our glasses were covered in an unknown substance (most likely poor dishwashing). Needless to say, we grabbed the check and left. It seems like the restaurant was understaffed and the manager needs to look at the scheduling of employees as this was probably their busiest weekend of the year.",

    "text": "I arrived here with couple of my colleagues for dinner since we had our business partner visiting us from out of town. Even though there were plenty of empty tables, it took them ten minutes to get us to the table. We didn't mind because we were having great conversation.   Once we were seated, our server was very quick. She took our drink orders and brought it fairly quickly. We told her that our two guest will be coming in few minutes and she didn't bug us after that until our guest arrived (I like that). We had enough time to decide what we wanted to order for appetizer so we ordered it right away when our waiter took the drink order from our guest. Again, our waiter just kept her eye on our drinks for re-fill from distance. If we were close to empty than she re-filled it. One of the think I hate about going to bar is they bug you get more drinks right after you are about half empty and it wasn't the case here.   Our appetizer arrived in fair amount of time, I had hummus and pita where I though pita should have been litte soft like I used to get at CANS when there were open. Now, we were down few drinks and we started talking about our college life so now god help us LOL.. I am glad I was able to keep it all PG13. We ordered our main dish while we are about half way done with our appetizers. By the time everyone was done with their collage story, our food arrived.   My goat cheese ravioli was delicious! I clean out my plate even after finishing my hummus and pita. We never felt we were pushed for additional drinks or any other items. That's how it should be IMO. I would have given them five star but I didn't like the wait in the beginning and I think they can improve on the pita.   I have been here plenty of time during night out for drinks but this was the first time I was here for dinner. All in all, it was great experience.",

I guess luckily they weren't busy and we were able to be sat in about 15min. Our waitress was either new or not having a good night as she was very not a people person that evening. About 5 of the menu items we asked about or tried to order were all sold out or discontinued. I went there specifically for the Guinness Beef Stew and was informed that even though it was on the Chef's Specials menu, they will no longer be carrying it. Pretty much all of us ended up ordering burgers since that was one of the few items they did have available. When our food arrived and we asked for silverware, our waitress informed us they were out of silverware then had to go try to get silverware from another server. All in all, I (and pretty much everyone in our party) will not be returning here to eat, ever. I hadn't been in a couple of years and I guess a lot has changed!",

    "text": "I only go to Ri Ra for the nightlife aspect, so I'm not going to comment on the restaurant aspect. And as for the nightlife, I don't mind going here, but don't really prefer it either.  Located right in the heart of Tryon in downtown Charlotte, this place becomes really packed on weekend nights. And while I don't mind paying the $5 cover for guys, I don't really enjoy this bar when it gets way too crowded. It can get very difficult to move, either upstairs or down, but sometimes you can move out to the patio on nice nights & find some breathing room.  As for the atmosphere, Ri Ra has just never really done anything special for me. I just think of this place as a nicer bar that's always crowded, so I'm always looking to get out of there when my friends want to stay. They have live bands some nights & that just adds to the claustrophobia of the upstairs. If you can get a table, the place isn't as bad, with a good beer selection & excellent bar tab system. You can open your tab at either the upstairs or downstairs bar & then proceed to order from either bar. This takes away from the hassle of always having to go back to the same bar you opened your tab at.  Other than a nice setting inside, Ri Ra just never seems to impress me and/or make me want to come back again. I'm sure there is a reason the place is always packed, so I guess I'm just out of the loop on loving this place. So while it's not a one of my favorites in Charlotte, I don't mind the place for small chunks at a time.",

I've definitely partaken of a few of these nights. It's a nice bar, with lots of room and generally lots of fun people looking to get after it. Again, this has all been said before.   What I wanted to write about is that Ri Ra's is a nice place to head for lunch, especially if you're downtown (or Uptown, whichever your prefer). They have a really efficient salad and sandwich line--it's conveyor belt style, where you pick your bread, your meat, your toppings etc. It's a really quick process, and so it's a good place to head if you're not sticking around, or if you're in a rush. But the food holds up--it's not bad at all.   It's right next to the Bank of America building and offers a huge plaza of outdoor seating, so its location is ideal. Especially when it's nice out.",

My friend and I had done an afternoon fundraiser/bar crawl one day and we were starving afterward. We headed to RiRa's at around 5 pm, before any of the crowds got there, and we were seated upstairs. We were the only people up there for most of our meal. Had we been on a date, the candle-lit atmosphere would have been awesome. I had the beef and Guiness stew. It was heavy and so so delicious. So my point is that if RiRa's doesn't suit you as a bar, definitely try the food during a less-busy time. It's well worth it.",

The game seemed to have them a bit frazzled, but you could also tell they were trying pretty hard. There isn't a TV for every 10 degree turn of the head, so that's a plus. Food is more interesting on the weekends, as they offer Irish brunch dishes - my Irish Benedict (1st try having gotten consumed by a table pal after arriving with rashers, a thick, ham-like meat) was good, with the potato cakes stealing the show. I'd come back on a non-World Cup weekend for this dish, absolutely.  Bloody Mary was meh, but it had a huge pickle spear as a garnish. Hard to be angry at a drink that comes with a pickle.  For me, Ri Ra's is a better place to hit off-hours with friends, all of us squished into a booth, talking about Ulysses. But its' sports bar alter-ego is definitively what pays the bills.",

The sandwiches are overpriced, VERY slim on the stuffings (meat and cheese that is...they will give you all the shredded lettuce your little heart desires...yay).  And to top it off, their seemingly extensive chalkboard of sandwich fixings is paired down by about 50% on any given day, due to them being out of stuff.  Skip the sandwich shop and go to the upstairs balcony for lunch outdoors when it is nice.  You can get their sheperds pie (really good) for the price of one of their sandwich combos (really crappy).  Ho-Hum bar experience...during peak times, can get annoyingly hard to get a drink/have a conversation/breath downstairs, but you are in Uptown.  What do you expect?

Tab was $20 for the lousy drink and one beer. No thanks. See ya never!",

Their brunch menu is perfect for people with a wide variety of likes. There are quite a few people in my family that prefer lunch food so it was nice having the option of breakfast and lunch.   Our waitress was fantastic! Very attentive and made sure we never ran out of water or coffee.  Food wise the shepherds pie was outstanding! They serve it with bread (it was ok) and butter. The special was a prime rib with au jus sauce that was cooked perfectly and was generous in size. The Brussels Sprouts are tasty. They are served shaved rather than whole or halved which made it easier to eat. Warning: they are very salty. Next time I'd ask for less salt.  They have lots of great boozy drinks and a Bloody Mary bar.  I'll definitely be back!",

I heard two ladies say, \"I hate the music\" and left. Without spending any money. Overheard another 2 couples complain about the music and I went up and talked with them and they agreed to the same thing I thought : we came in her to get away from that and hear the music more associated with an Irish bar.   I asked the bartender, and he said , \" well Saturday night in Charlotte \". What the hell does that even mean? Anyhow, after talking to the hostess, she explained that a band was supposed to be playing but that they could change the music.   They did change the music so I stayed. Thanks to the hostess.   Come on management, no one comes into an Irish bar to hear rap!   Since the music was changed while I was writing this, I revised my rating to a 3 instead of a 1.   Interesting, people now tapping feet etc.",

As I started my reuben adventure around Charlotte to find the best one the city had to offer, I couldn't think of a better spot to begin. I wasn't disappointed - it's funny how sometimes the first can be one of the best on a journey.  The corned beef on the reuben at Ri Ra still stands out as either the best or at least in the top 3 of the about 30 reubens I've tried so far around the city. The best way to describe it is tender, hand carved meat off a well braised chunk of real corned beef - none of that deli meat stuff. It's beer braised and the flavor is just incredible. The rest of the reuben almost isn't worth talking about after that, but I'll keep going anyway.  The cheese was good, but there wasn't enough to really come through the other ingredients. The kraut was clearly made in house and pretty good, and the bead was above average rye with a perfect crisp. If the proportions had been better this likely would have been the top reuben on the adventure. Ri Ra has an excellent reuben on their menu and it's absolutely worth stopping in to try it.",

The bartenders we've dealt with are friendly and happy to take the time to answer questions, for example, about the countless varieties of Irish whiskeys they serve. Nice selection of beers, both Irish and local craft, and the food we've tried has always been awesome. My personal favorite is the Irish Chicken Curry, featuring imported McDonnells Irish curry sauce. We like the atmosphere too...traditional pub, lots of wood, dark...feels comfortable.",

The only reason this lunch service does not get 5 stars is due to the recent deterioration in the materials used for the burgers. There has been a noticeable depreciation in the quality of the buns and the fries are a hit or miss. That said, still worth every $1 on Burger Mondays.

Super tasty and generous food. I loved the beer battered fish and chips and the pork chop with broccolini and potato cake looked (and I'm told was) great.  4. Cragganmore single malt. Yes, it is pricey. A single will run you $12 but it is my favorite scotch, so I say it gets a number.  5. Friendly and jovial staff. We made an open table reservation on a Friday night and though they called to say they couldn't necessarily honor the exact time, when we showed up they had our table waiting despite walk in customers waiting to be seated.  6. Did I say McSorely's and Colman's w/malt vinegar? Because if I did why are we still talking?  Ri Ra is a classy version of the Irish pub I love to feel at home in. Go check it out.

I haven't hung out here but from what I understand it's good for the bar experience. I usually go here to dine though as it's convenient to the Belk Theatre. This last visit I had steak tips and potatoes and honestly it wasn't great. The meat had a funny taste to it and the potatoes had no taste to them and some of them had gone bad I think. My grandmother had the fish and chips and she said it was decent. So for what it's worth that was our last experience. I've kind of combined all my trips into this one rating so 3 stars is about all I'd give it.",

I had the banger rolls which is just Irish sausage wrapped in a blanket of bread drizzled in Irish mustard. It was really good.

The service was a bit slow, but we understood because we had a large party.  The service was ok. She was extremely nice, she forgot drinks quite a few times and messed up a few orders so those people got their orders way later than us and all of us were pretty much done with our meals. I ended up waiting 35 minutes for my Bloody Mary.  The food was nice. My fiance got the all day Irish breakfast and he liked it because it wasn't too greasy. His favorite party was the bangers. I got the breakfast boxty which was scrambled eggs and cheese in an Irish style crepe drizzled with hollandaise sauce and served with home fries. I enjoyed my breakfast and everyone was pleased with their meals.",

Our server appeared shortly after our arrival and took our drink order - Smithwicks for my friend and a perfectly balanced Dark and Stormy for me. Kudos to the bartender for crafting a great cocktail!   My friend ordered the Shepherds Pie and said it was solidly good and not amazing. 3.5 our of 5. For myself I had three small plates - a shaved Brussels Sprouts and Bacon dish that was very nice, Grilled Corn with Limed Butter and finally some Sweet Potato Fries.   All up it was a good meal that I would probably rate as 3.5 except that YELP still does not allow for that (Always hoping!). So I will err on the side of generosity and make that a 4. And I would add - definitely try this place.....",

My friend and I were looking for a place to enjoy a nice meal and beverage when lo and behold, we saw a familiar name: Ri Ra Irish pub. I was very familiar with a sister location in Vermont as I had attended school there. We made a beeline for the door and were immediately greeted by a very friendly face who's name we would come to find was Tom. After much deliberation on where to sit, we chose the bar, where we were blessed to have Tom as both our drink guide and deliverer of food. He gave great conversation and food recommendations. I asked for no onions on my salad and he swayed me against that idea. Man I was not disappointed. So if you go, make sure you listen to Tom, he's a smart man. If I ever return to Charlotte NC, I will definitely be going back!!!",

We came for lunch which I was kinda bummed, I wish we had came for dinner because for dinner they do live music! We saw the little stage where the performers set up. None the less we enjoyed ourselves. You walk in and are immediately transported to Ireland. I loved the layout of it! I believe I counted 3 different bars! Don't forget to go upstairs!   The food was very authentic. We ordered the potato cakes to start, which I don't know how you could go wrong it's like the best food ever, and they were delicious. A little small but it was an appetizer. It had a balsamic drizzle on it along with the sour cream, it was very interesting but delicious. It also was on top of some green lettuce, which I really didn't see the point in that much, I just didn't eat it. They were cooked perfectly.   For my entree I had the Shepard's pie. It was definitely authentic. There was no cheese and it was lamb instead of ground beef. Though I prefer our Americanized version better, what they deliver is clearly what is stated on the menu so I'm not mad about it. I still ate it all. My brother had the Guinness burger and he practically devoured it in 3 minutes. My husband had some turkey sandwich with cheese and bacon and apples. He liked it. I tried a bite (for the sake of my yelp review of course) and it was pretty good as far as a turkey sandwich goes. The bread was toasted nicely and buttery. They each had sweet potatoes fries as their side which were also very good.   All in all we were all satisfied. I loved the decor of the place. And a shoutout to our waiter (Tom) who was super sweet and attentive. Great service!!",

I ordered from the bartender and asked if I could please have a large cube or sphere of ice. This is a pretty common request this day in age for any place that serves good whiskey or bourbon. The bartender said sure, my husband orders a beer... the bartender returns and says that they don't have any large ice and they don't have the beer my husband ordered. Ok well that's crap but we regroup and both order different beers well guess what they don't have that beer either! The bartender goes on about how they need to update the menu but it was also listed on the electronic menu. Come on guys, you need to under stand how much of a bad first impression this is for a guest! We were going to order apps but at this point NOPE! Lost our business over this and I could see the frustration in the bartenders eyes. They need the managers to do their jobs so that the staff can do theirs!",

Server seemed not to knowledgeable of the menu as we ordered drinks. Waited a while for them just for him to come back 10 minutes later and say they ran out of the stuff to make my drink. Ok, ordered something else and waited some more.  We ordered the fried crawfish,it was great. I ordered the Ruben and it was big and juicy and everything you would hope a Ruben would be.

    "text": "Although our food was good, and I enjoyed my dinner, I'll never be returning to this place. Our group of 16 was treated so horribly that I can never bring myself to reward this establishment with my business. I understand that our waitress was new, but no legit establishment gives a server a table of 16 on their first day. That's asking for a disaster. We were sat in 15 minutes and were all near each other, so we thought \"Hey, this will be great.\" Little did we know, what was to come.   Once we put our orders in, it took about 20 minutes to get drinks, our server kept asking who got what and promising she'd be back soon. Half of our table got their food first, which we understood and told them to eat. 15 minutes later the other half got their food minus two people. The server walked away for another 15 minutes to then come back and say, \"I don't know what happened, but your order didn't go through in the system so the kitchen just started cooking your meal. It'll be out in a few minutes. Again, not really sure what happened. I entered the food.\" 25-30 minutes later, their food arrives, and it's wrong. Wrong sides, wrong combinations, but at this point we had almost finished our plates and the two left we're starving so they just took the food. Once we finished, we just wanted to leave, so we asked for our checks. It took 35 minutes to get the checks which weren't even correct until the fourth time. The server reprinted our receipts 4 times before giving up. The two people who had suffered the most, asked if they could be compensated since they waiting so long and didn't get the right food. The server said she'd call for the manager since she needs his approval, so we waited. As a side note, we were waiting for the manager while trying to get the correct receipts.  So not only could our server not print them right, the manager wouldn't show up. She claimed to have asked for him multiple times, but didn't know where he was. Toward the end she got a rude attitude, which I can somewhat understand, because it must be incredibly hard to print receipts wrong 3 times, not place a customer's order in computer system and not ever once say the words, \"I'm sorry.\" After the 35 minutes of waiting for the manager, our group decided to leave, and it wasn't worth the two receipts we wanted to get corrected. They offered to just pay and be done with it. The server then said, well I can give you the employee discount. It'll take $5 off your bill. They took it and left. We were all irritated and over the service at this point.   The manager Jacko (I asked for his name on the way out) never showed, so kudos to you for not doing your job and managing a restaurant. The food isn't worth coming back for crappy service.",

When he asked the bartender to make a real drink he had an attitude and did it reluctantly. About an hour later the same thing happened to me. All tonic, no gin. Waste of $6. Politely asked the bartender to make a new drink worth the price. The bartender rambled on about how it was too bad and the sale was final. He made $12 off of about $0.50 of tonic and no alcohol. Completely rude and unapologetic. Thinking they could take advantage of people who have been drinking already. Unless you feel like throwing away your money, there are much better bars that actually care about the customer experience.",

I asked them to reheat it and they did (which took 10 minutes oddly enough) but the mashed potatoes on top were still cold when it returned which makes me think they transferred it from the previous plate. I think I was supposed to get butter with my bread so I asked and they brought out some frozen butter in a tin. What am I supposed to do with that? lol. Anyways, great for drinking but skip the dining experience. I really wanted it to be good because the one in Atlanta was excellent.  Too bad another poor service experience ruined a special occasion.

    "text": "I LOVE the Ri Ra.  However, I hate the uptown (parking makes me anxious), so my visits, unfortunately, are too few and too far between.  In 2009 when I read that they had a fire and would be closing down for a bit for renovations, I am fairly certain a tear or two rolled down my cheek.  My arteries opened a lil bit, but I was mildly distraught.  Thank goodness they did the renovation and re-opened!  Recently before an event at Blumenthal, my date and I schlepped it over to the Ri Ra.  After parking at the BoA deck, it was a short walk, and was only a few quick steps away from our final destination of Blumenthal/Belk to see a concert.  Want to sit at the bar?  There are 2 beautiful dark wood bars to park your rump at to slurp down syrupy beers and shots.  High tables with stools?  Got those.  Tables that you can get up and down from without flashing your stuff if you have on a skirt?  Have those too.  2 floors of seating, all dark and lovely, give you plenty of room to pop a squat and enjoy some Irish/bar food at it's finest.  There is even a small terrace/patio upstairs for enjoying Carolina blue days when it is a little warmer out.  My secret dream in life is to find a nice Irish boy to move to the green, green Irish countryside with to spend my days waiting for his liver to pickle/fail.  I LOVE corned beef and cabbage - it's a sickness really.  And while I love to make it, it stinks up the house, so it's always nice to be able to find this delicious dish where it stinks up someone else's kitchen.  The corned beef and cabbage at Ri Ra is delicious.  The corned beef is tender and not terribly stringy.  Well flavored.  the cabbage is... well... cabbage.  Cabbage-y.  Cabbage-ish.  Nothing fancy, just good.  The mashed potatoes that go with are creamy without being runny.  Hearty Irish fair for a green-eyed girl.    For an appetizer, we ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip which is served with a portion of sliced baguette.  YUM!  Creamy, cheesy, good.  When it hits the table, resist the urge to dig in immediately, or you will be peeling the top layer of skin in your mouth off for the rest of the night.  HOT.  Molten hot.  I previously had the corned beef/cabbage/mashed potato egg rolls, but I didn't see those on the menu.  That was a bummer because they were off the hook good.  I followed the dip with the corned beef and cabbage.  Happy tummy.  We decided to split a dessert and got the peach pie.  That was not a winner.  I don't know where on the pie our slice was, but it was the part with no peaches in it.  I think I accidentally ate one, but I may be mistaken.  Normally I am too full to eat dessert anyway, so this isn't a deal breaker, but I won't be getting that again.  On previous visits I have had the Reuben, which is stuffed with tender corned beef and served with a side. The colcannon side is tasty(mashed potatoes with cabbage mixed in).  The macaroni and cheese is creamy with a crumb topping.  So many things on the menu look delicious, but I almost always stick to my standard Spinach dip and then corned beef and cabbage.    Great bar/restaurant, awesome ambiance and great food!",

    "text": "If you don't already know this, Irish Pubs are known equally as well for their booze (ales, whiskey, and lager!) as they are for their \"pub food.\" I award 5 stars to Ri Ra for exemplifying the latter quality in its lunch menu. Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, positively, worth the trip.   Almost everdyday the lunch menu offers a \"special,\" which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in (ouch!), nor do they get soggy when adding condoments. I'm not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh and soft, they're practically falling apart, until glued in place by the panini grill. Unlike other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun. The special pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as \"Christmas in a bun.\" You decide.  AND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean seriously, just when you thought life couldn't get any better, you get a pickle for the win.   I'll definitely be filling out my loyalty card here (8 sandwiches, get one free). And you need to be beating the lunch rush, because once the special is out.... its OUT. Word has gotten out about the magic that happens at Ri Ra though, so don't get left behind :P  5/5",

    "text": "Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be.   What I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment.   Stick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.",

The key is to get there before noon so you can find a table in the shade outside.  Fantastic scenery to watch while you crush the fresh sandwich.    Another tip is to ask for the frequent flyer card.  Buy 8 combos (chips + drink) get a sandwich free!",

My husband and I sat at the long bar, while a fire roared behind us and the NFL playoffs were shown on the one television.    I rarely order burgers but was enticed by the Guinness BBQ Burger, figuring that it would be impossible not to pair well with my frothy pint of Guinness. I don't usually order burgers since they rarely meet my high expectations of a well seasoned, juicy, not-too-big-but-not-too-small beef patty, but RiRa delivered on all counts. I scarfed the burger, leaving little room for the good, but not great fries. My husband was very happy with his burger, which was some sort of super-spicy special and apparently left his mouth satisfyingly aflame.   We'll be back!",

Since I already had dinner for the night, I wasn't very hungry, but I was interested in trying something... I decided on the potato and leek soup, which was incredibly creamy and delicious...  For drinks, I had the Jameson Rose (which was a vibrant pink... I don't know why that surprised me as much as it did, but it was pretty cool... lol) and a beer flight for $6.  The beer flight was Guinness, Harp, Smithwick's and a mixture of Harp and Guiness called the Half and Half... I thought it was a great value with some quality beers.    My cousin thoroughly enjoyed her nachos, but she sent back a cocktail... She apparently ordered a drink that no one ever asks for because Michael had to check the menu to remember how to make it... It didn't sound like it would taste great from the description and my cousin is ultra picky, so I don't fault him at all... lol  Overall, I had a fabulous time at Ri Ra... I might have to start going out a bit more often...",

I suppose that says it all!! I had the potato pancake appetizer which was beyond yummy and the very reason we ventured in to begin with.  I also enjoyed a cucumber/radish salad which was so yummy I'd certainly go back just for those two items along and of course a cold beer to wash it all down. The bar area appeared to have a \"local bar\" hang out vibe. That said we certainly felt very welcomed from the time we walked in until we left. They have bread from a local bakery that's different but in a very yummy way!!! Our server was very attentive when needed but also gave us our space.

The fritters were nothing more than goat cheese balls rolled in some sort of dry breadcrumb-like coating and then deep-fried, and topped with caramelized sweet onions. There was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste.   Corned Beef and Cabbage is an Irish Pub staple, but Ri Ra has absolutely no clue how to prepare it. The corned beef was bland and somewhat tough, and despite the fact that they put some sort of cream sauce on it, it still had no flavor. The cabbage was both undercooked and without any hint of seasoning. Even adding salt and pepper did not help it. I did not eat the mashed potatoes that came with the dish, so I can't comment on them.   Ri Ra is a fairly nice looking place with a decent selection of beers on tap, and if you just go there for drinks, you should be fine. However, there are many places where you will get a much better meal, and I would definitely avoid the food at Ri Ra.",

The stools we sat in were not the most comfortable, but nothing to really complain about.  Food: Excellent - The food here is great. The menu selection is not too vast, but it's decent. I had the Lamb Roast Pie which was phenomenal. It had a goat cheese and potato bake on top, and I was pretty happy. My wife, who is picky, got the Hot and Smoky burger, which was great as well. The fries were ridiculously crispy, and just had that beautiful crunch to them. We had Creme Brulee for dessert, which I wasn't crazy about. It was cold on the bottom, and wasn't completely \"burnt\" on the top.  Service: Good - The waitress was attentive and helpful, but didn't get in the way. Food came out in reasonable amount of time, and everything came out as ordered.  Overall we had a good time, good food, and a fun night. I give Ri Ra a thumbs up!",

The most noticeable difference between it and a pub in Ireland is that it is a lot bigger than a pub in Ireland, though it's still a lot smaller than your average restaurant.  The food and atmosphere are amazing. They have the best shepherd's pie I've ever had, bar none. Their soda bread, while not traditional, is very good and is a perfect compliment to their OUTSTANDING potato and leek soup. It's the perfect thing to warm your insides on a blustery evening. The burgers are just okay. The decor is great, with the heavy wooden tables and stone fireplaces, it feels like a real, rustic pub.  The prices are a few dollars more than I think is fair, thus the 4-star rating. Be sure to join their rewards club so you can get discounts and gift cards to make it more affordable.  Oh, and they have live music later in the evening on weekdays.",

The bartender looked at us walked away. I assumed he would come back after helping another person at the bar. After 10 minutes he never returned. In the mean time a waitress also saw us sitting there politely ignoring us still. Drink less food less. Needless to say the RI Ra in Atlantic City is way better. When I come back to Charlotte I won't be trying this restaurant again.",

They give you a good cup portion. They do not need anything added to them. Unless you add salt to bring out even more of the sweet flavoring.  I would have actually preferred these over the luke warm fries that came with my meal.   We had a genuine irish waiter who was in training and did a phenomenal job (and i am VERY big on service!!) My date loved his hamburger. Consider i was not offered a bite as i usually am it must have been delicious.  The calamari was a bit over priced for the size. It was served with banana peppers a balsamic vinegar dribble, and a red sauce that reminded me of salsa but with a more tomato base and no spice. I have had better calamari at hole in the wall restaurants.",

I got the smoked salmon BLT which was actually surprisingly not bad. The prices are a little off to me, but I guess you're in the city maybe that's how it goes. This place is an in and out restaurant. Call what you want what bread you want (and make sure to say roll instead of for example wheat which is sort of just like bread) and they'll make it and you'll be out in a couple of minutes depending on how long you wait in line.  This place has pretty fresh ingredient and I would no doubt be coming here if I was working downtown. However, this place I give three stars for the wait time, the prices, and that overall it just wasn't amazing nor bad.",

    "text": "I have been a casual customer of RiRas for years.  I love the feel and atmosphere, very much get the Irish Pub vibe.  I have always had good food at RiRas and appreciate that unlike places that call themselves an Irish or British Pub, RiRas actually has REAL Shepard's pie with lamb, as well as a hearty lamb burger.  Often when uptown I am a patron of the side sandwich shop, which always makes the best sub uptown.  Yesterday I went in late afternoon with my boyfriend and young stepdaughters, after visiting the Bechtler. It was an off hour so we were seated promptly.  However, it was quite a while before our waiter came over.  When he did, he was quite harried and told us he was sorry but he just started his shift and didn't know we were there... hmmm, not a great start.  I kind of had to tell him he needed to get our drink order, which he did.  He was very courteous and friendly, but it was an odd exchange throughout the meal.  I just got the feeling he hadn't been trained very well/this was his first wait job.  He said he was new to the area so maybe he was just a bit disoriented. Again, he was very nice. My biggest disappointment was that I have had a delicious lemon vinaigrette there before, and he nor the kitchen staff seemed not to have any knowledge of it.  I have been eating healthier and I was really looking forward to that vinaigrette.  Disappointed they didn't have it or even know of it.  All in all I will return to RiRas, but for a place that's right uptown, they need to make sure their staff is aptly trained - the food is important, but that is 1/2 or more of the diner experience.",

It took 45 minutes to get our server to take our dinner order. It was very difficult to get our server's attention throughout the evening. We waited on drinks so long that we ended up re-ordering from the bartender. One person from the group re-ordered her drink twice and never received it. Really bad service, which is unfortunate because we really like to award good service!  The food, once it came, was excellent. Everyone was happy with their order- flavor, portions, offerings.  Sadly the service (or lack thereof) means we won't be bringing our big groups back here. It really seemed like the server was out of her element.   Update: a member of my party shared the experience with a manager and she adjusted the bill to compensate for the service. That earns an additional star from me.",

I dare you to spend three minutes waiting for a traffic light to change near these folks without seeing where I'm coming from.) discussing loudly just how \"ratchet\" they wanted to get.  (Seriously - first time I've heard the term used un-ironically. Ugh.)   My silent prayers were answered when none of the nearby spots they discussed plans to boot in the near future included Ri Ra.  Don't know, don't care where they wound up (bless the single [if that many] beating hearts among 'em. [Yeah, I meant it that way - this was one creepy belligerent Borg-like group of sisters]); but my visit to Ri Ra was a definite success. Service was fairly efficient, the food was fairly good (my main complaint is that sides weren't seasoned (even salt and pepper) and chips could have benefited from a few more minutes in the fryer.  But \"Authentic Irish fare\" - no.  Really, no.  Irish-ish, yes.  Definitely.  But  there are too many nods to American chain cuisine to merit equating this to what one would find in Ireland, having spent a few months there.  In the \"win\" column: drafts were good and well-served, though mostly not particularly Irish (not a complaint, just reinforcing that 'authentic' is not the best word to use to describe this place accurately.  Fair to good selection / variety.  And the setup is fairly good, even for nights when they're packed.  Fair mix of tables and bar seats & service, with a decent amount of floor-space for when they're busy.  The house ground burger was great - good mix of fat and lean, good grind size. The kitchen makes one hell of an egg.  And that's no small thing, especially in a pub / bar, which means the usual service hand-offs and oddness.  The malt vinegar mayo should be on the menu - it saved the otherwise fairly blah (undercooked) chips.  The fish and chips, though, falls on the other side of the ledger. Fries were blah, as above, and fish was unbelievably unseasoned, and overcooked.  No one likes chewy, fishy fish.  I was a little puzzled by the two glasses of white zin that were perched on the back of the bar for several of my visits (which each lasted several hours)...Odd.",

Even with reviews to check out, you never know what you might get. Ri Ra had good solid reviews, however, and was within walking distance of our hotel, which was a deciding factor!  It was fairly busy when we got there and there was a trivia round going, which was slightly annoying, since it echoed through the whole restaurant, but we were there early and once the game ended, it was much better.  We were impressed with the selection of import and local beers. I stuck with Smithwick's but my partner was a little more adventurous and tried several local NC beers, all of which were good.   We started with the hummus appeitzer, expecting the usual bowl of hummus and sliced pita. We were more than pleasantly surprised when what we got was the hummus, toasted pita, and a selection of roasted red peppers, olives, marinated artichokes, and cucumber and celery for dipping. The hummus itself was excellent, garlicky and spicy.   I had the Irish curried chicken over rice and it was quite good. The curry was sweetish, but still had a nice bite to the finish. The chicken was all white meat and nicely tender, and the peppers and onions that were in the curry were delicious.  My partner had the Guinness beef and veggie stew, which was also really good. There was lots of beef in the stew and the Guinness added a really different (and delicious) flavor.   Once the trivia game was over, the atmosphere was great. Music was fun but not too loud for conversation. Our server was friendly and helpful. She made great food and drink suggestions, and even gave us info on places to check out during the rest of our trip.   Ri Ra is definitely a solid 4* and we'll be back the next time we're in Charlotte.",

All in all, the staff didn't have to be as great as they were (really could have just sent us on our way), and I was expecting okay at best bar food.",

We did order some drinks, but there was little to no evidence that alcohol was actually included in our drinks....well played Ri-Ra's.  With that said, I would still come back here for a sandwich and some apps.",

The burger was the 704...I honestly can't remember if It even came w/ the pickle chips.  The really really low point of the meal was the desert. The bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock. It did come smothered with a caramel sauce, but that couldn't save it.  When asked how our food was I was honest and could tell the waiter was taken aback. I mean seriously, don't ask me if you don't wanna know.  I was polite about it, but said that the dessert was just average.  And questioned why it was cold.  Bread pudding is always warm no?  He also got docked a few points for twice trying to take my plate while I still had more then half of my food left.  He actually removed my girlfriend's drink while she was still working on it!    It was nice to have a late night eating option in uptown, but unless someone else wants to go I won't be back.",

Stopped here because I've never been before, so I ordered the old faithful Reuben. Pretty hard to screw up, right? Well they managed to serve me a sandwhich that was barely eatable as the corned beef in it was like leather....very hard and chewy. The sandwhich was small. For $9 I'd expect a LOT more. The Rose Sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. Not a very good sandwhich.  Service was iffy at best. The young lady behind the counter was very nice and personable, but the other two seemed like they didn't want to be there...aloof is the appropriate term.  The ONLY saving grace were the Keogh's Dubliner Irish Cheese and Onion Potato Crisps imported from Ireland. If this place is going to rely on packaged potato chips to save them they won't be in business long.  So a SMALL sandwhich, chips and a 20oz bottle of diet coke set me back $14 with tip. That is a LOT for a LESS than adequate sandwhich. I will not be coming back.  NOT recommended!",

The hostess and server was great. We ordered and our food was brought out fairly quickly. It was a Monday and lunchtime but the place was not packed when we got there. A few more customers did trickle in while we were there but it wasn't crowded. My boss ordered a soup and sandwich combo and he said it was delicious. I ordered the Irish stew with a side of cesar salad. Both were delicious as well. I loved how the stew is made with lamb and it a nice cracked pepper taste to it. A co-worker of mine said that they have the best macaroni and cheese but I did not try it. I wanted to try the fish and chips may have to do this on my next business trip. There are way too many restaurants in the area that I have not tried yet and want to before I go home.",

The selection of import beer was good and the bartenders could make up some crazy concoctions. I always had a blast working on the weekends cuz the crowd was fun, the music good, and the tips = phenomenal! One hint: if you don't want to wait 30 minutes to get a drink from the bartender then snatch up a cocktail waitress and they'll get in bout 5 minutes. Allow time for them to fight the crowd to and from the bar and you'll have your drink in no time. And yes - a tip is appreciated.  Anyhow! A little history about that bar that I learned while working there: everything downstairs is imported from Ireland. The owners have a partner over there who does nothing but look for antique stuff for ambiance. Ask you server the next time you dine downstairs about some of the artifacts. It's actually pretty impressive.  Oh! And if you get a chance to dine outside on the patio take it! It's always comfortable and has a seperate restroom out there which is nice since there's not an abundance of restrooms.",

The decor is very authentic and could definitely see this place getting pretty crowded later on at night since the upstairs and downstairs are really not that big.

We were also seated close to the live band that was playing, who were awesome by the way.  It is a little smokey inside but I didn't come out smelling of smoke so that was a plus.  Some people had ordered food and it did look pretty tasty.  Next time I will have to get some spinach and artichoke dip which is what the people next to us had.  There are two levels, from what I've heard the upstairs has more of a club atmosphere, needless to say we didn't venture up.  The first floor was great if you ask me.

We ordered a round of drinks and settled in to relax while looking at the menu.  Decided on the Guinness braised short ribs, one word:  DIVINE while husband choose the special of Pot Roast which they were out of and instead ordered a favorite standby of Sheperd's Pie.  After eating every bite and wondering if anyone would notice if we licked our plates (just kidding but seriously our meals were THAT good) we ordered dessert of Irish soda bread pudding which our server managed to score us the last serving of (told you she made up for her earlier seemingly disinterest) and shared its goodness over a coffee press.

After spending a week in suburbia hell, I wanted to see if Charlotte actually had a downtown, and happily I found it, along with affordable parking. We were super hungry, so we literally stepped into the first place that served food once we got out of the car. Luckily it was Ri Ra. I hear this is a rocking place on the weekend, but on a cold Tuesday afternoon, we pretty much had the place to ourselves (except for the loudmouth \"screenwriter\" at the bar). We sat by the fireplace and enjoyed Harp on tap and sandwiches. My pastrami was delicious, but if I could do it again I would have the full serving of the magnificent mac n' cheese. The lunch menu was extensive with very reasonable prices. The best thing about this place however was our waiter, who is getting married in Jackson Square down here in NOLA this August, bless his heart. He was super nice and attentive with zero fakiness. Best of luck to you, kind sir!",
