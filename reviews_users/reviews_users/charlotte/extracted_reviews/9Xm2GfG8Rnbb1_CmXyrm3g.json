    "text": "As a Plaza Midwood Resident for the past couple of years, I have been wanting a chicken rotisserie within walking distance. My prayers were answered when Coaltrane's was introduced to our neighborhood.   The place is similar to Viva Chicken, but there is more diversity (the wings are a great addition to the menu!). I also think their sauces are more unique and flavorful.   My favorite items on the menu are the chargrilled wings and the fresco bowl. All ingredients of the items I've had from the menu are incredibly fresh.   Definitely a Plaza Midwood favorite of mine. Please show them some love; you won't regret it!",

I could have gotten more at Dominoes for half the price. It was mostly just bread, tomatoes and onions.   My wife got a quarter chicken which was about the size of a quarter lol.  Seeing as this place has only been open for 2 weeks you would think they would be serving it better. We won't be back.  Oh and btw, the terrace bar upstairs which supposedly had views of the city I guess meant views of Plaza Midwood since I couldn't see uptown at all.",

While low-key in design, it is the perfect match to the specialized and manageable menu of rotisserie chicken, bowls, salads, and sandwiches (and don't forget the amazing chicken wings and stuffed avocado!).  A nice additional touch is their Bluzy Brunch on Sundays, which offers traditional brunch items in addition to their regular menu, as well as live music entertainment and a Bloody Mary bar (yes, please).  Mike, the owner is always there to make sure the customer experience is on point, and the chef Tristen not only pumps out super-tasty food, but pops out to the table to make sure everything is perfect.  Nellie is the newest addition to the staff, and never stops circling the tables - fantastic service!  Definitely try this spot out, you will want to go back.",

    "text": "Yesterday I tried this place out for the first time for lunch as it is close to my job and what can I say but the food was AMAZING!!! Well at least the Buffalo wings, stuffed avocado and \"street\" corn known to us a \"grandma\" corn. We also had the black beans that had great flavor but was a little more on the al dente side then I would like (the young lady who was working was really nice and got us some more). The chipotle maple wings remind me of a spicy sweet sauce (very spicy) in my opinion but I also think Siracha is super HOT so it just depends. You could definitely taste the maple but I was okay with that, although I preferred the Buffalo. If you want saucy wings ask for extra sauce but if you get the Buffalo you probably won't need it because the flavoring is amazing. Oh, I also had the goddess salad and the fresh farmer, we went for lunch and dinner in the same day. . Will definitely be back to try more of the menu, it's small but I prefer small menus as to not over whelm me. Definitely give this place a try, I'm sure you'll be back. 4.5",

I ordered the Pepino salad, asked for no tomatoes, and the other 3 in my party got 1/4 chicken and two sides. My salad came with no feta, no arugula and no salad dressing (which it was supposed to have on it).  It did however come with the tomatoes I asked them to leave off. It was basically $10 for romaine, onion, tomatoes and chicken and in a puddle of water. One of the sides with the 1/4 chicken was incorrect and the guy that brought it out seemed frustrated and short with us when we explained what it was supposed to be. I had to ask twice for the dressing for my salad. The food overall was pretty underwhelming. Perhaps they need more Time to work the kinks out but they should definitely think about hiring nicer staff.",

Amazing chicken, delicious sauces, fresh healthy ingredients, friendly staff, amazing space, cool upstairs patio with a view of Plaza - this place has it all! I get the rotisserie chicken either as half a chicken (a breast and a leg, marinated tender and perfectly herbed & spiced) or I get the chicken shredded in a bowl with quinoa and avocado or in a sandwich. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! When we have guests we always take them to Coaltrane's!",

The FOOD is GREAT! Perfect for to-go orders. I hope thy continued to build out that option (there appears to be a walk up window). Tons of healthy options - no seafood option: - chicken, steak and veggie only. I ordered the wings and the Rice Bowl - the Fresca Queso cheese is a shaved fresh queso not a sauce (like at a Mexican restaurant). My friend ordered a salad and it looked amazing. I will Def be here in the summer on the deck ordering a salad.  If you choose to dine-in, the atmosphere is casual and relaxed. Good for kids, groups of friends that want to eat and chill. There is a small rooftop deck (on the backside) with a small bar. Cute and cozy. Will surly be packed in the summer cause drink prices are reasonable.",

Have to put this chicken over RoCo and Viva, because I loved the charred skin.   Great service, too.

I think it's awesome you can do a half order of it, either for a good sized lunch or you just want to save room to try their other tasty options. All of the sauces are delicious,  I love flavor so I mixed them together differently for each bite and honestly offered me a fun way to eat as well. I especially love their 2 most hottest hot sauce though.    The corn casserole was not what i expected to be which was street corn style but i appreciate their unique twist & my 10 month babyboy sure liked it. The mash potatoes are delicious!!!!!! The steak cooked & flavored so tasty & wonderfully as well.   Been in Clt my whole life & never came to what it was before.  I don't know if I should be ashamed or that's common.  I noticed there was something here but for no reason at all I just never experienced it. I sure don't regret giving this a try though & I'm glad Coaltrane is here now. Most likely would frequent this place on the regular now. Everyone is so friendly!",

This is a cool, quick service spot with healthy,  yet tasty food.  Order your food at the counter, take a number and your food will be brought to your table when done.  Full bar upstairs with a nice patio so I definetly can't wait until the weather truly breaks.  They have some really good specials during the week like 75 cents wings and $4 Wine. The rotisserie chicken, pinto, brown rice with quinoa, stuffed avocados and street corn custard was amazing.  Oh and the drinks were pretty good too. The staff was attentive and genuinely seemed interested in making sure we had a great dining experience. We'll definetly be back!",

To top it all off the vibe is amazing and the service was incredible. The owners were so sweet and walking around talking to folks.   We didn't go to the rooftop bar because it was cold but I will definitely be enjoying that this spring summer.   Highly recommend. If you've just walked by before - like we did for months- go in!!!

I've tried some of the food already and everything has been good so far. I tried the avocado (haven't had Vivas) but this was excellent and had a perfect balance of seasoning.

    "text": "Update 3-26-18 So maybe my headline was a little harsh, but I was extremely upset and extremely disappointed and Frankly, I just tell it the way it is. I have since received a defensive message from the server, (which I thought was a little tacky), but at least I know they're reading the reviews. I only hope they can take customers reviews into consideration to help improve their business. Maybe instead of taking offense of my review, both the server and the owner could've asked the question, what can we do to make our customers experience more enjoyable? Sometimes a little constructive criticism from the people who actually spend money at your establishment is the best feedback of all. You have created an incredible atmosphere and a wonderful space. With just a few minor improvements, your establishment could be five stars, and be packed every night with happy customers.  Voted the absolute worst chicken wings in Charlotte!!!! HUGE disappointment!  For a restaurant that specializes in chicken, you think the food would be delicious. The wings are the tiniest chicken wings I ever had, with absolutely no sauce, and they only served six tiny little wings and two pieces of carrots for nine dollars. I have a 100% success rate of calling out businesses that are going to fail, and unfortunately this is going to be one of them. Even the service was bad. I ordered three extra blue cheese and when my order came there was 1 ranch on the plate?? No napkins on the table ( all of the bins were not refilled, on any table) and the upstairs bar tender was to busy texting on her phone instead of helping us...  I am going to anonymously give them another shot. If my second experience is better than my first, I will update my review and delete the old one and let everybody know the outcome.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this new spot since it's in my neighborhood but unfortunately I wasn't very impressed. The menu is almost the same as Viva Chicken or even the other new place Roasting Co. Due to the location of Coaltrane I was hoping they would try to tap into the nightlife in Plaza Midwood.   We walked in and were warmly welcomed by either the manager or owner. She informed us there were some specials and that their was a bar upstairs. We placed our order and the gentleman taking it didn't seem to know the menu or how to ring it in. Now I know they are new but your staff needs to be trained before interacting with guests. I told the guy 3 times that I didn't want beans on my stuffed avocado. I also had asked if there were any other type of bean, other than pinto, that could be subbed out and the manager said she is working on getting black beans. After placing our order we went upstairs to check out the bar. This bar is more like a small server station and it's outside. I am so disappointed with the set up of this place because it had so much potential. They have signs up for NYE at Coaltrane and it seems like they want nightlife but you can't count on that with a tiny little outside bar.   Now we decided to sit inside since the temperature was in the 30's. The food was delivered to us and the waitress was very friendly. I cut into mine and there were beans, lots of beans. Now the stuffed avocado was good minus the dang beans. Then I ordered the street corn casserole, I'll warn you now it's not street corn... it's cornbread. The favor was good if you wanted cornbread but it didn't taste anything like street corn. My date got the quart dark chicken and he said it was ok but that he prefers the other two chicken spots over this one.   I think they are trying to tap into a market that is already a bit monopolized. I am just so disappointed to not see this as a nice place to grab a cocktail. I would give them a second try but I don't think this will be a regular spot for me. Best of luck Coaltrane!",

    "text": "The Plaza Midwood neighborhood in Charlotte welcomed it's newest eatery and added another awesome dining experience to an already impressive resume.  We had an opportunity to preview the Coaltrane's Char Grill which opened it's second location in the Queen City at 1518 Central Avenue in a recently renovated early 20th-Century brick building that once housed John's Country Kitchen.  Coaltrane's founders Mike Libretto and Mario Flynn went above and beyond to bring this location to life, including adding a second floor dining experience for some intimacy and a tree house deck for sipping suds under the stars with a spectacular view of uptown.  With a menu that has a little bit of everything (as long as it isn't fried or unhealthy), even the most the discriminating foodies on a budget will feel right at home.  From rotisserie chicken, flatiron steak sandwiches, quinoa w/ roasted vegetables, stuffed avocados, and a supremely delicious desert menu that includes Tres Leches, Coaltrane's has their bases covered.  For our craft beer aficionado's, Coaltrane's has you covered too.  Their rotating tap has some great local craft beers and several from outside the area as well.  They also have a decent wine and spirit selection if you lean that way.  Fantastic family-friendly restaurant in a gorgeous building run by an amazing staff.  Who could ask for anything more?",

The place has a cozy feel downstairs but also has an upstairs area with a full bar. The food options are similar to Viva Chicken and Roco. I had the quarter white chicken option. The chicken was just ok. But with the sauce it was good. I asked for mash potatoes but was told they had none. So I got Street corn casserole and stuffed avocado..which was pretty good. The wife had wings. She had to get them to go because was told after 10 minutes of waiting for our food that it'd take 20 minutes for wings. We may try Coaltrane's again one day. Maybe. With so many other good options in the area now, they need to step it up if they wanna survive.",

The mural outside catches your eye instantly and leads you right to the deceptively large parking lot.   Inside, you've got tall ceilings, a gorgeous chicken mural, and beautiful wood accents all over. There aren't many tables, but it doesn't feel as small as it is. I think our waiter's name was Kenny (?) and my sister mentioned he had waited on her last time she was there. He was friendly and upbeat and gave us just the right amount of time to look at the menu.  My sister went with the stuffed avocado with chimichurri sauce and I got the granja bowl. YUM. I ate less than half of it and had to push it to the other side of the table because I would have eaten the entire thing even with a full stomach - it was THAT good. I had the rest for lunch today -- not bad for a $10 meal!",

We were finally in the neighborhood and decided to swing by to pick up some take-out, and I'm damn sure happy we did.   My wife and I stopped in on a Friday night. Walked up to the small 4-top bar to place our order. She went with the Choripan with chorizo, as a wrap. It had an awesome flavor, and was a generous size. She opted for the quinoa stuffed avocado, which was good, but not quite as good as Viva Chicken's ...  they definitely hold the award for that. I opted for the Gaucho sandwich with flank steak since I was on poultry overload since Turkey Day passed. This sandwich was STELLAR. The flavor was immense, and the steak was cooked to perfection. I couldn't believe it. The corn casserole side was also out of this world, and will probably be my go-to next time we make it back.   Side note: they do music trivia every Friday night. So grab your friends, grab a beer, and enjoy.",

In less than 10 minutes we were eating!  There was a Dos Equis pint special for $3 but I was charged full price at $5. You can tell the MOST about a biz by the way they handle issues. The workers apologized and offered a $5 gift card. I accepted this even but believe they would've refunded me the $2 if I asked. Smart on their part since I have to return to use it.",

Perhaps I should've read deeper into the reviews before making my choice tonight. This place is a copy of Viva Chicken, but yet, not Viva Chicken. Exact idea though. Half avocado, street corn pudding, mashed potatoes were my choices tonight.  And sweet tea.  The girl behind the counter was so nice and she was the star of the evening!! I thank her for her outstanding customer service.    After ordering my food, the rudest person in the universe came to bring it out, she brought the wrong order and tried to dispute that it was wrong..huh? I know what I just paid and asked for. Thank you. The sweet tea was gross so I asked her if they had or could make more and she was so unfriendly...basically saying no...& walking away without offering to help. I don't understand why she even works there. She shouldn't.  The nice girl brought our order out finally and also fixed up the tea for me.  It tasted a lot better.  The manager also came out to check up and she was really nice too.   The food was not my favorite.  The avocado was good. The corn was not what I expected. It was like corn souffle only not sweet and basically flavorless.  Mashed potatoes were ok. The beans that my friend had were meh.   Overall...not thrilled, no desire to venture back. I wouldn't recommend nor go out of my way. Try at your own risk.",

There were tables In a small warehouse space with a server!  In today's environment of having to pre order and pay at the counter, this was refreshing!   I ordered the BUENO BOWL, which was full of pulled chicken, black beans, avocado, pico de gallo, and other yummy things.  They have a few bowl options and several sandwiches on the menu.  The atmosphere was fun.  It was a bit empty when we were there, but it was on Monday right after the peak lunch hour.  There was lively music, not too loud and not too soft.  Had never heard of this restaurant until I found it on Yelp. Another example of YELP being a great resource.  OH, they also gave a FREE beverage just for checking in on YELP!  Gotta love it when that happens.  It was worth the drive across town to experience this.  Two thumbs up!",

We had a really nice server. He did the best with what he had. I say that because they ran out of beer because it was a busy weekend, so there were 2 taps not being used because the kegs kicked and they had no replacement.  I saw on the website that there was a beer special (see attached pic) but he checked with mgmt I guess and they said they weren't doing that special - someone better fix the website. I would have gotten one of the beer specials if they had honored their own website advertisement.   Food was good! Mashed potatoes and gravy and street corn casserole...yum! I will definitely go back, but hopefully at a time when they're \"not recovering\" from a busy day.",

We went with 2 salads and added chicken to both.  I got a side of the salsa verde (mint and jalapeno - not spicy, very yum!) and my husband got a side of all three hot sauces (he said they weren't overly hot, but they were tasty).  The chicken was good and the salads fresh and crisp.  They were delivered to our table very quickly.    We had our pick of tables...because we were literally the only customers in the restaurant.  We opted to sit upstairs on the outdoor patio - it was a nice feel, but a bit lonely.  We were told this place gets quite busy on music trivia nights...  Overall, the food and service were great.  This will be a repeat for a quick, casual dinner.",

Neat setup with seating and a full bar upstairs make this Plaza Midwood fast-casual spot a crowd pleaser.   Dinner on a Saturday night after an afternoon visit to Codescape and sunset drinks at Thirsty Rabbit; I was surprised that it wasn't that busy, but guess they are still developing a customer base.   Good price point and the fact that there are on-tap beers and other drinks available will make this place work well in the neighborhood. The stuffed avocado dish was good and the sides of mac and cheese and quinoa with vegetables was just right. Very surprised that my friends could also order the avocado as they had \"run out of it and were on their way to get more.\" They'll work out any little issues like this and hit their stride soon enough.   I don't live nearby, so would go out of my way to eat here, but a solid option affordable option while neighborhood.",

Went in on a Sunday night after a bit of snow and the place was completely empty. Waitress was really nice and asked if we wanted to change the music or what was on the TV. She was also extremely personable. We started with the wings (half and half) this was definitely the move seeing as they are char grilled you d you not feel totally unhealthy after eating them. I got a quarter chicken with the corn casserole and the stuffed avocado and my girlfriend go a bowl. We both ate it all and were super impressed. Prices are also extremely fair. If you are looking for something high quality, unique, and reasonably priced check out coaltranes and dont skip on the wings.",

Everyone was ready to explain the menu, offer suggestions on what to order, ask if I needed anything at all, etc.   The interior is gorgeous. If you ever frequented the previous tenant, John's Country Kitchen, you won't believe this is the same space. They've somehow added an open loft space, beautiful exposed bricks,  and dark wood paneling to a spot that was pretty old and well, well worn. It is literally a brand new place.   I had the stuffed avocado with pulled chicken and a side of green beans. While the avocados were good (more about them in a minute) the green beans were the star, hands down! They are crunchy and garlicky. Sooooo tasty! I could eat them by the bucket full. The avocados were also good. The avocados themselves were perfectly ripe and soft. (I hate it when you get an avocado that's still kinda hard because it's not ready yet.) They are stuffed with quinoa, pinto beans, and queso fresco and topped with a red, creamy sauce. They didn't have quite the kick I was looking for, so I went back to the counter for their salsa verde. That did the trick!  My only piece of feedback/room for improvement... I wish they had the sauces out for self service like the other Peruvian chicken place in town that I shall leave unnamed. I would have liked a little bit more salsa verde (it's killer!!) for my avocados but didn't want to look like a total fat kid by asking for more after I already downed one container's worth.",

Now when I say rooftop, I'm not saying it's a panoramic view of Uptown Charlotte- it's a small rooftop that overlooks Plaza Midwood & the neighboring buildings.   I was a little indecisive as to what I wanted to eat because everything looked so good. I finally decided on the Fresco bowl & chargrilled wings. The Fresco bowl was a nice size and all the ingredients tasted fresh. The chargrilled wings were super saucy (which I love) and the dipping sauce that came with it was really good as well.   Service was amazing, as they were attentive and provided me with great recs as far as what to order. When my dad came in town, I recommended the wings and he enjoyed them as well. I only wish they came in size options like 8, 12, 16 or something.   The only downside is parking, especially on the weekends. There are VERY limited spots behind the building and street parking fills up quickly to accommodate the other businesses in the area.",

The flank steak was ok, but unfortunately, was over-cooked to Medium-Well  (Medium-rare would have been so much better) and so a little tough, and surprisinglydidn't have a lot of flavor to the meat, though the chimichurra helped a bit, though even the sauce was a bit flat. Need to flavor it up, Salt and pepper go a long way!  The corn casserole was oily and a bit dry. But the Wings.....!  The waitress was very sweet and attentive. One big pet peeve, she took our order and then came back couple minutes later to ask us again which sides we ordered.  Write down the order, please we won't think less of you and will be happy to get the right order. 2nd restaurant in a row where this happened, seems to be a trend.",

Randomly walking through Plaza Midwood and based on everything in the immediate area we decided on CCG.  From the outside I wouldn't have imagined it being as big as it was with an up stairs and rooftop area. We checked out the rooftop which was small but actually very nice. We decided to sit downstairs since we saw one waitress so figured made sense to stay downstairs for better service.  We ended up ordering 1/2 chicken with sides and I ordered the French Toast with eggs and Grilled chicken. The chicken tasted great and had the best grilled taste. Literally didn't think we would finish it all but was so worth it. The French Toast was a bit mushy for me so I didn't really eat it all. I don't recall if the menu mentioned a white drizzle of sauce being on them, not big on sweets so that could have been the reason.  The mimosas were well made and they have this raspberry beer that my fiance had which he enjoyed and noticed other customers having the same so it's popular. I sipped it and it was a bit sweet so I stuck with mimosas lol.  Overall cool spot, love the exposed brick and out waitress was attentive so overall good visit and we would come back again. I bet that rooftop is awesome at night so we'll be back to try that lol.",

The place is not huge but that is part of its charm.  It also has an exposed brick wall...so plaza!   The meal did not disappoint.  I order the Fresco Bowl and ate the ENTIRE thing...it was that good.  Our server was cool by bringing us many different types of sauces to try.  All delicious...even the hot ones!  My friend ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with black beans and quinoa with roasted veggies as his two sides.  We're close but not close enough to ask for a bite...he did say it was delicious though!    It happened to be half price wine, which was great because my friend and I had a lot of catching up to do!   Y'all know the deal with parking in Plaza...it can be limited at times, so prepare yourself for that during certain times.     Can't wait to go back!",

I ordered the french toast, with 1/4 chicken and scrambled eggs.  Ok, this french toast is not your usual bread that's squared and dipped. This was two large thick dipped pieces of bread, but then it's so mushy on the inside and sweet! My other friends had the rio wrap and breakfast bowl. And they loved their food and mine!  We sat outside on the deck and it has a view of Uptown! There is also a loft area for seating that looks down on the first floor. Our server, Sue was amazing! She knew the menu very well and was very attentive towards us!  I can't wait to try their lunch and dinner menu!  Monday is wing night (.75) and Friday is music trivia.",

I was expecting more of a Viva Chicken atmosphere (maybe I thought that because stuffed avocados were on the menu?), but was surprised when I walked in and they were playing music trivia bingo! As we were caught off guard, a server came up to us to seat us, but we let her know we were going to get take out. She took us over to the bar and gave us menus. The vibe reminded me almost as a RoCo. Chill/laid back/beers on tap/etc.  For our meals my husband got the steak sandwich, and I got a chorizo burrito style wrap plus we split the stuffed avocados. The food was made fresh, and took about 15 minutes from ordering to pick up.   I must say the food was full of flavor, and I loved the green and roja sauce we got on the side. I don't know how to explain the flavors, but they were fresh and unique. I also really enjoyed my wrap- it was FULL of chorizo so you're def getting your monies worth here!  For the stuffed avocado, I loved! The quinoa was super fluffy.  Yummy!   All in all, for under $25 you can't beat it. The meals were around $9 and came with a side. My husband got the corn casserole and loved it!!  We will be back!",

It's located right on Central Ave, within mere walking distance of Soul. The public parking lot that's on Thomas Ave is right behind it.  I had no problem getting a spot and walked into an empty restaurant. I placed my order for a fresco bowl (with no arugula) and a drink. They have the normal soft drink/tea offerings but I decided to try their berry lemonade. It didn't really taste like lemonade, just some sort of non-specific juice.  Coaltrane's is a 'hipper' take on South American food including bowls, wings, rotisserie, stuffed avocados, and salads. They also do brunch and have daily specials.   The bowl was made pretty quickly and I went with the salsa roja sauce and it was delicious. A hearty, filling meal that didn't leave me feeling to stuffed. Personally, I just wish there was more avocado.  I had two people check on me to make sure everything was good and I appreciated the attentiveness.",

My first visit to Coltrane's was on a Friday night where a friend invited me to Music Bingo (So much Fun). At first the plan was to just enjoy the bingo and have a few $3 drafts, but the menu looked so tasty it was hard not to order food. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with the mashed potatoes and green been's and it was DELICIOUS! The chipotle sauce and the chimichurri sauce were both amazing.   The beer selection was solid, but I didn't see much in terms of a cocktail list. The theme of this place was also very cool.   I think this will be a new go-to place in Plaza for me!",

The wings and 1/2 chicken were fantastic, holding a fresh from the grill flavor and done perfectly. We used all the sauces which each carried the quality of their preparation. I've got to say DO NOT MISS 1) the sweet corn casserole as a side and PLEASE 2) get the stuffed avacado. I could write a review about just the stuffed avacado, THAT good! Those sides were like The Beach Boys background vocals, locking the whole meal into a sweet and spicy harmony. I think there is pride in product here, get it while it's happening! There is an inventive and traditional presence to the restaurant and the staff were friendly and even shared their favorite twists on the avacado (psst... it's feta).",

It was a rainy day when I visited but the rooftop seating was filled to the max.  Glad to see restaurants are getting creative with using existing buildings and working to make some exciting spaces.  Order at the counter and receive a number.  Staff and servers were all very friendly and the food was made to order.  I wasn't that hungry but the appetizer wings and a side of street corn casserole was more than enough to satisfy.  The buffalo wings had a nice char on them and flavor.  A little heat to them but came with a dipping sauce that mellowed out the bite.  The downstairs eating area feels a little tunnel like, as the counter is located in the back and there is a half bank of booth seating that delineates the route to place an order.  It is plaza midwood, so not my favorite place to park.  Luckily I had scooter-ed over to the neighborhood that day and took an Lyft back.",

It's fast casual, so you order at the counter, take a number, find a seat, and wait for your food to be brought out to you. Our food was ready pretty quickly.  I got the Fresco Bowl. I loved it. The chicken was really juicy and flavorful and all of the flavors in the bowl blended well together.  My only complaint is that it was pretty small and I was still hungry after finishing it. I also got over of their house made lemonades which I thought was just ok.   Mine didn't come with a side, but my coworker thought his quinoa with vegetables was too garlicky, so he let me try it. I completely agreed. I love garlic, but I couldn't eat it because it had so much garlic in it that you couldn't taste anything else. They were really nice when my manager complained about it and let him replace it with the street corn casserole. I tried some of that and it was delicious.   I would absolutely recommend trying this place if you haven't already! I'll definitely be back again.",

They do 4 rounds and you could jump in or out wherever you please. There were prizes each round and one sponsor, Lagunitas, came around offering free beer samples! In addition, draft beers are $3 on Fridays!  The service was good and the food was great! I ordered the bueno bowl which has a maple pulled chicken, guac, quinoa, and some other yummy and healthy things. It was a little spicy due to the jalapeno salsa, but very good! The hubby got a sandwich with real chorizo and a side of the corn pudding which was excellent! Definitely get that side! We also got $3 juicy jays which is an awesome deal. The whole thing was very affordable. We will definitely be back to try more menu items!",

I attempted to send an email to the address listed on the website (<a href=\"mailto:eat@coaltraneschargrill.com\">eat@coaltraneschargrill....</a>) and my email bounced back. I tried to fill out the comment section on the website and immediately was met with a message stating \"Failed to send your message.\" Wondering why I would ever return to a restaurant that does not appear to want business (how can someone call to place a takeout order when no one answers?), gives incorrect orders to patrons and has no way to contact anyone.",

I attempted to order on Postmates, and I guess I started my order before they flipped the \"too busy\" switch so was a little confused when I wasn't able to complete the order.  Instead, we called in a pick up order and were told the wings would be 30 minutes, which would be alright but I'd rather not wait, so canceled that part of the order.  I wish I wouldn't have, though because the order we went with took longer than that anyway and was of much lower quality than past orders.  Even with the difficult parking we still had to wait a long time once inside for food.  Instead of an apology they just said \"OMG we're busy\" even though it didn't appear to be the case.  This place is usually good but there is way too much good food in Charlotte to deal with that sort of disorganization.",

Love the renovation of the space; fits the neighborhood and the outdoor area and bar will be a great additional spot to go once the weather gets warmer. It's not like Viva Chicken since you have more meats, sides and most importantly, booze. My favorite is the sweet corn casserole!",

Super cool atmosphere inside the building and the employees are super nice, friendly and helpful. We added this into our rotation for local restaurants to grab food from- highly recommend stopping by for the rotisserie chicken and corn casserole!",

I really wanted to like this restaurant but the food was somewhat boring. The chicken wasn't dry or anything but it wasn't enough to be my favorite meal. I'll give it another try",

    "text": "Coaltrane's is a great new addition to Plaza. Very, very similar to Viva Chicken with a few differences on their menu. My only recommendation for ownership is to cut back on the amount of salt and speed up the service. I waited about 25 minutes for my meal. Try the char-grilled steak - good stuff!",
