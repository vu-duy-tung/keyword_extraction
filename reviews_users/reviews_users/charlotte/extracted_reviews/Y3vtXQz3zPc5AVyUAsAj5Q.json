Other than the pho (which is honestly the best I've had personally as of yet) I definitely recommend starting off with the stuffed chicken wings and/or egg rolls and getting the Royal fried rice with the pineapple. I've heard good things about other items they have and have tried other things since I mooch off my friends every once in a while, but other than a nice hot steaming 'just right' bowl of combination pho with extra noodles those are my personal go-tos.",

    "text": "First of all I should explain that I'm no Pho expert, but I *have* had this dish at many places, especially in Greensboro, where I live. I've even made a pretty good Pho at home. Expert? Nah. Enthusiast? YES! I also don't feel it's completely fair to review a restaurant after going only once. But, as I don't frequent Charlotte all that often, here it goes... I found \"Pho Real\" (clever name) to have a very pleasant atmosphere, dark-ish with neon. The waitstaff gets an A+... very attentive and very helpful. I told the waiter that I loved Pho but wanted to try something slightly different. He suggested Hu Tieu (chicken soup, very similar to Pho). It was served quickly and was presented with an abundance of jalapeno, a whole garden-full of basil, mung bean sprouts, plenty of noodles and lime wedges. Waiter said it was their most popular dish. Unfortunately, I have a couple of slightly negative comments: Broth was chicken, as advertised, but a bit weak and lacking the explosive flavor one gets with a good Vietnamese noodle soup dish... even something so potentially bland as chicken (the menu claimed it was a chicken/pork/seafood-based stock -- I would've expected a little more \"strength\" from a stock with all three of those components). The Hu Tieu also had \"seafood\" *in* it (also as advertised) but that consisted a single shrimp and a couple of that fake crab glop that cheapens any dish. The Pho restaurants I've been to have real shrimp, calamari, etc. No fake stuff. This restaurant has a LOT of dishes on it's menu, so I'm sure there are some delightful stand-outs. However, it IS a Pho restaurant, so I hope THAT dish is up to par. I have to admit, if my first experience at Vietnamese cuisine had been this place, I may not have become a fan of this type of food. Fortunately, I *AM!!!*. When arriving you are faced with a bit of a 2-story climb (even though I'm an out-of-shape old guy, it looked worse than it really was). But, if you've got some elderly friends/family with you, you should know that there is an elevator conveniently located around back of said stairs. Oh, and by the way, I ordered a Bloody Mary here, and it was HORRIFIC. Sorry, it just was. Too much pickle brine, I believe. You CAN put pickle brine in a Bloody Mary, but definitely NOT that much. A question of personal taste? Yes. Too much brine for anyone on the face of the planet? Absolutely! Bleech!!! And I *LOVE* pickles!!! I should say something good about this place (beside the pleasant ambiance and excellent waitstaff): I truly think this is an GREAT place to bring a group that wants to experience Vietnamese cuisine but might have the varied tastes that comes with a number of people, i.e.: its got quite a lot to choose from on the menu! And... I'll bet quite a few thing are quite flavorful... I just didn't get the chance to try them all! I'm giving this place 2 stars as Yelp says 2 stars = \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" That \"Meh\" comment is pretty much spot on. This is definitely NOT a \"bad\" place... not by a long shot... it's just that I've had substantially \"better\". And just in Greensboro. Yikes!!!",

I did an experiment where I went to Saigon Bay, then Pho Real, and then back to Saigon Bay - each time accompanied by my brother.  He had been a long time attendee of Pho Real and he preferred Saigon Bay.  The difference is real.  The prices here are lower than Saigon Bay but the portions are smaller and the flavor isn't to my liking.  Both have competent waitstaff and plenty of parking.  I usually don't write a review and name drop a competing restaurant but these two are so close together.  I can't think of  a single reason I would ever go to Pho Real.  Even if Saigon Bay closed down I would search somewhere else for that level of flavor and enjoyment.",

Then the bartender didn't acknowledge us when we came to the bar. I understand she was making drinks but an \"I'll be with you in a moment\" would have been nice.   Then she directed us to a sign to place order online and receive 10% off but mentioned she hadn't noticed the 10% coming off.  FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! I asked to speak to the manager on duty about the False advertising and she said both were out then when questioned further she said she was the night manager. I wasn't trying to take advantage I was merely responding to the advertisement. Sad thing is I tip a standard $20 during the holidays but since she is the \"undercover\" manager she won't miss it.",

That's usually a tell-tale sign that it's more style than substance.  The broth was pretty weak, and that's what it comes down to.  Meat was fine, noodles were ok, portion size was a so so.

If your running a restaurant you should always tell people if you've ran out of stuff like vegetables ahead of times, instead of waiting till you bring out someone's meal. Waiting for forks and spoon after 10min after your food is not great either. I've ate at many other pho places. And this place is the worst at cutting corner(trust me I know I grew up on pho). All in all, there are a lot more thing that I can complain about but I'll keep it to a minimum. This place is for beginner of Vietnamese cuisine. Wouldn't recommend for any of my friends. It's a shame I have to give it even a star.  #teamfatazz",

I would make the extra ten minute drive to the pho places in the ghetto just for better service and better pho.  Lately, I've given them another chance.  Their service has been more than excellent.  I've been there three times within the past month since I've decided to give them another chance.  2/3 times, I ordered food that was delicious (both bun bo hue).  3/3 times the service was quick, polite, and attentive to the table's needs.  They've come a long way with service and food quality from when I quit eating there four years ago.  The restaurant itself is clean and the seating is very spacious.  They have a full service bar and it's quiet there for the most part.  If you asked me four years ago to recommend a pho place, I would immediately tell people to go to Central Avenue or I'd offer to make it.  Now, if you're looking for a good pho place in the university area, I would recommend pho real.  Whatever you guys did to turn your food and restaurant around, awesome!  Keep doing it!",

Usually I pick the pho restaurants we go to but he suggested this one, and I would most definitely come here again. It's located in a nice little shopping complex on the second story.   The restaurant itself has quite a few tables but it was pretty full because Saturday night. However, we were seated quickly and given menus. You can get pho in 4 different sizes, which I LOVED. There's a big bowl, a just right bowl, a small bowl, and a bowl for kids (I assumed). Extra points for that. Price points are pretty reasonable for the sizes as well. I ordered a small bowl of pho (their most popular combo of meats) and my boyfriend got the biggest pho with flank and rare eyeround with no onions and cilantro. I was sick earlier during the day and I was able to keep my food down, which was nice.  The broth was very light and clear which means that they boiled it for a long time. It was really flavorful and I slurped up pretty much every single drop. I also liked that they had lime wedges and not lemon ones (and they were very generous with their lime, bean sprouts and basil). Overall, very delicious. Service was also very good! Water glasses were constantly checked and everyone seemed very nice.  Complaints: as my boyfriend was signing the check, I saw a sizable black bug on the ground. And the sanitation score was only 90. I mean, being Asian, I'm not tooooo picky about that... but the bug was honestly pretty gross. Yep.",

The pho menu is interesting because you have different bowl sizes you can choose from, thin or thick noodles, and the choice to have extra meat or neat on the side. It's truly convenient. The broth itself is not quite right to my taste but it still blended with the rest of the bowl so I'm satisfied. The atmosphere is very casual yet hipster. I don't understand why you would combine a bar and a pho restaurant, but I guess it's a try. I didn't like how the restaurant is on the second floor which is an inconvenience. The service is really nice; the waiters were friendly. The only thing is the high tip so beware. I would come back again to try their other specials when I get the chance to return to Charlotte.",

    "text": "My first experience almost made me not want to come back. Serious. But my man liked it and so back we came and then they won me over.   My first experience here I thought the pho was lacking flavor and the spring rolls were just okay. I don't order the spring rolls much but I have become a fan.  The papaya salad at this location is amazing. I crave this salad. It is light, refreshing, crispy and fresh. The papaya salad is covered with thin shreds of dried beef that offer some meatiness and has this bright soy dressing that is the perfect balance of all flavors. I normally prefer my papaya salad Thai or Laos style but Pho Real has converted me. I love this papaya salad and will have to get some now that I am thinking about it.  The bun bo hue is good here. Good solid flavor and not oily. I was expecting a piece of pork trotter so I was surprised to see it just pieces of pork trotter in it. I would like more of that. One of the favorite parts of bun bo hue is the pig foot and gelatinous skin and meat on it. The noodles were perfect, the meat was tender and really it was on point.  The pho the last few times has been better and definitely on point. One of the things I always look for in pho is the coloring of the meat. I have seen pho where the rare meat once it gets cooked gets a tinge of metallic coloring to it and I haven't seen that here. Which means their sh&t is fresh. Can't be mad at that. Their soups come in different sizes which is awesome sauce to me. Perfect sizes for everyone in our family.  Get a shake here with the popping bubbles. We were very excited to find this because after moving from Las Vegas, where popping bubbles are available everywhere we hadn't seen it so much in Charlotte. They also offer different flavors for the popping bubbles.   Overall, I really like this place. They have good solid eats.",

However, judging by my four star rating for Pho Real, I'm obviously OK with it.  Pho Real is located at the top floor of the shopping center located off of Harris Blvd that has Total Wine and Ashley Furniture. It's not a big restaurant by any means but I like the cozy feel. There is a long bar area in the back where you can pull up a seat or place your to-go order.  Every time I've visited Pho Real, the service has always been super friendly and accommodating. The waitstaff is willing to explain any menu items and make any needed dietary adjustments.   For my experience, I've had the chicken, veggie (tofu), and beef pho. There are about four different sizes of pho bowls that you can order. I always order the 'little' size and it's more than enough for me. However, they will bring you out a bowl big enough if you have a killer hankerin' for pho. The broth is delicious. Not overpowering but definitely very soothing. They bring out a plethora of pho 'fixins' so you can make your bowl your own.   If on a cold day (or any day, really) you find yourself in the mood for something a little bit different than your typical bowl of soup, make a stop at Pho Real!",

The waiter was very patient with us, knowing nothing about the food. I ordered the bird's nest. It was noodles that were hard shaped into a bird's nest. On top of the noodles are different meats, vegetables, and a slimyish gravy. You need the gravy to make the noodles soft. As far as taste, it wasn't strong and was similar to what you might have in a light Chinese dish. The texture of the gravy threw me for a loop. Nothing remarkable, good or bad. The spring rolls are different as they are wrapped in rice paper, not fried and are very fresh. While they may not look appetizing, it's like a mini salad rolled up in an easily edible format. I'll be back one day to try other things on the menu.",

Great Vietnamese place around the area.Their sign is a little difficult to see as you're trying to find the place. The restaurant is located at the second floor of the shopping center. Clean and super cozy atmosphere.  The restaurant has the bar area that you can sit and relax with your drinks. We were seated immediately and drinks were served after waiting any \"waiters\" for 15 minutes. They have a lof of menu selections and portion size that we can choose. Plus, beer and smoothies menu is separated from their food menu. We ordered veggie pho and vermicelli. They came with good portions. The soup was very well done and nicely presented. Very fresh ingredients hands down.  Service was meh, slow and inattentive. Prices were reasonable. A good choice if you are staying in the area. Definitely would return again!",

The name of this place is enough to entice me to at least check it out, plus it was 10 o'clock at night, some friends and I just have the munchies but don't want any fast food. The fact they have a full alcohol bar is cool and all (not too much of a drinker myself), but because they have a bar they tend to keep their hours late, which is a good thing for me!  The food is decent, have visited 30+ Vietnamese cuisine locations myself, I would not rank this as the best I have eaten, but it is certainly not one of those little shop that you would only visit once and no more.  I tend to rate a Vietnamese cuisine place by three things: the freshness of their spring rolls (not the fried kind), the taste of the broth from the pho, and the signature rice dish. The spring rolls here are okay, I wish they had put more filling into them. The pho broth was pretty clear, I did taste some artificial flavoring, and for the price and the bowl they brought the noodle out I was hoping I would have gotten a bit more. The grilled meat (Chicken and pork) with the rice dish were juicy, definitely not overcooked and dried.  Overall I would this a 4 star because I think for the price I was paying I expect a little bit more.  P.S. Recently they started to advertise \"Popping Boba\" with Boba tea... very interesting, you have to try to find out why it's \"popping\"",

(The shrimp, however, were great)  I had a bowl of fried rice with tofu which was quite good but not outstanding.   S-i-L had a lemongrass tofu dish that was very good.  The atmosphere in  Pho Real was nice, with the exception of a large TV over the bar at the far end of the restaurant.  The service was excellent.  On the strength of our daughter and S-i-L's recommendation, I'd be willing to try Pho Real again in the future.  (If not for their recommendation, I'm not sure we would.)",

If you're not ready to order....DUH....just say so and be done with it.  Most people that go in there KNOW what they want so perhaps thats what the waiter was going by.  If I were that waiter quite frankly...I'd wish you never came back either.  FOOD SNOBS.

Lots of fresh herbs and bean sprouts to accompany the savory bowl full of noodles, meats, and broth.  The broken rice plate with grilled pork, grilled shrimp, and eggroll along with the hot not-ramen-tasting-but-real chicken broth and vegetable soup are always deliciously seasoned and have been cooked and brought out hot and fresh. Great service and beautiful atmosphere!! Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Several years back, I was so excited when I first heard about a Vietnamese restaurant by the name of Pho Real!. (There's a What The Pho? In Atlanta!) I honestly don't know why it took me this long to review this place. Living in Atlanta, the asian culture is pretty huge so there's always an asian restaurant everywhere you look. That said, there's not many decent ones in Charlotte. I can't say that Pho Real! is authentic but they're not bad. Their pho is ok. I still prefer my mom's. The rice dishes are pretty good. But I mean, it is pretty typical for any Vietnamese restaurant to serve these rice plates. Tastes the same as the others. I've really enjoyed their Hu Tieu. Really really good! Pho Real is a bit overpriced for what you get & especially it being Vietnamese cuisine. But then again, this is Charlotte, so there aren't many options. Pho Real is clean, which is a huge plus. Service is very polite and attentive. Unfortunately, I couldn't give Pho Real any more than 3 stars..maybe because I've dined at one too many Vietnamese restaurants. So 3 stars is only fair.",

As a vegetarian, Vietnamese food is something that I rarely get to enjoy because most do not do veggie versions of the food.  But Pho Real does and they do it fantastically.  The fresh spring rolls are perfect with a great texture and flavor.  The peanut dipping sauce is awesome.  I get the veggie pho soup.  The veggies are perfectly tender. The tofu is prepared perfectly.  My husband gets the veggie fried rice most often and it is equally as satisfying.  Our meat eating friends rave about the meat versions as well.  It is a great place to bring diverse tastes.  I go there weekly and bring out of town guests as well .",

    "text": "This place was recommended by a friend and I decided to check it out because he raves about how great it was. It's a great looking restaurant that's located upstairs. It's not a typical looking vietnamese restaurant, there's a modern twist to the interior design which I give a thumbs up. I also like how they have a bar but food wise, not that great. I should of known since my friend is white, no racism here. It's just I'm vietnamese and I know how pho is suppose to be. I order the beef noodle soup and my friend had the curry soup. First of all, the servers were friendly but holy crap are they slow. Service in general was just SLOW. My table and the table with 2 people next to us were the only people there and it took FOREVER to bring out our food. My pho was just a no go. I took 2 bites of it and I was fed up with it. The broth is not suppose to be dark to the point where I can't see the noodles and toppings sitting in it. That's a sign of the broth sitting the pot for too long or just old broth. The toppings are finely cut prices of beef which they are certainly stingy on. The bowl was big but it was just filled with a ton of noodles to hide the fact that they don't have to give a lot of beef toppings. For a bowl of pho that's around $8, I expected it to be better. My friend had the curry soup and it was decent, bread comes along with it but it might as well not have. The bread was stale and hard as a rock!! This place is just a no go for me.",

My first thought when looking at the menu was \"It better be worth it!!\" The food was a bit pricey, in my opinion, but after sinking my teeth into it, it's well worth the $15 I paid.  I was too chicken to be adventurous with in my selection so I kept it simple...I ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls with shrimp (2 rolls with each order) and their Shrimp Fried Rice (sizable portion for 1 person). The spring rolls were super fresh and the sauce you dip them in was amazing!  The fried rice literally was the most flavorful fried rice I've ever had in my life!!!  Service was good and the staff is very friendly and very helpful. Overall I was very satisfied and will definitely be back soon. Next time I plan to try the Pho and TWO orders of Spring Rolls!",

Service is usually horrible and it sucks when you go w/ a party of more then 6 because they automatically add a 18% gratitude on your bill and that's probably the reason why they give such horrible service while you're there. The service is definitely disappointing. I had pho here and they told me they were out of bean sprouts. The waiter brought me shredded cabbage as a substitute. I also purchase bubble tea here and they told me they had no bubble left. My bubble tea tasted like a milk shake! If you want good quality Vietnamese food go to Saigon Palace! You will not regret it.  Overall, I would only go here because its clean and in a good area and maybe because it was close by. But definitely would not go here if I had a choice!",

On the other hand if  you do want that most delicious of soups with an authentic experience beef tendon is an available addition of flavoring (along with all the lime wedges, cilantro and mung beans you care to toss in).

The jalapenos were somehow abnormally hot.   We also ordered stir-fried egg noodles.  This dish was much better.  Everything was cooked just right, and although the dish lacked a ton of flavor, it was still quite good.  They have drink specials for each day of the week.  We ordered one $3 glass of wine, which was actually pretty good, and all of the daily drink specials looked pretty good.  In fact, the whole menu does offer pretty good value.

Once immediately upon being seated -- so incredibly rude -- and once 30 seconds later after the jackass server brought me and my boyfriend our waters. We were both so offended, I ordered something in haste and he refused to even order, though we were both STARVING. We were so upset that as soon as I got my food I asked for a to-go container. It wasn't that great, honestly. For the price the food is totally sub-par, and it's not even that expensive. Just not worth it.   Terrible service, blah food. Pass on this one. I heard Lang Van is much better, and maybe they won't rush you out the door as soon as you sit down. I will absolutely not be back, not even to give them a second chance.",

    "text": "My coworker and I stopped by Pho Real once to check it out as a viable lunch option.  We took a look at the prices and decided on a state salary, it wasn't.   Our office later decided to have a holiday luncheon there, so we finally got to experience it.  Compared to other lunch options, other Charlotte Asian restaurants, and other Vietnamese restaurants I'd been to, Pho Real was mediocre.  We expected for the price it would be a lot better, but were glad the office was picking up the tab.    I ordered something spicy and while it definitely was spicy, that's all it was.  There was no other flavor other than the taste of hot burning my mouth.    So, no, I probably wouldn't go back to Pho Real.  Unless someone wants to take me there for another office party and pick up the tab.",

I don't know exactly what size of my bowl but my friend order Pho' for the both of us and it had all the meats (tripe, beef, meatball). Everytime I eat Pho' I normally put sugar in it (I swear its a Laotian thing) but here, I didn't have to! The broth was very tasteful. The waiters were very kind! I ordered Thai Tea as my beverage to go with my meal but they could of at least brough me water as well (I shouldn't need to ask).  Overall, my experiences here was amazing! They should make the lights a bit brighter though. I would recommend other people to come here and I will definitely come here again on my next visit to Charlotte.",

I've had MANY crepes in my day, and NOT ONCE did I have to get my hands dirty. The crepes required us to wrap them in lettuce leaves with cilantro, bean sprouts, and some other herb, and dip. It was so different and we loved it. It wasn't heavy. I can't wait to return to try something else.",

Menu Items  Summer spring rolls - The were ok but a bit dry with the rice paper rehydration step.   Fried Chicken Appetizer - The was off the chain. I would order two because the first one almost made me eat my fingers that were clinging on to the yardbird.  Seafood Pho - This is one of my favorite soups however,  the broth was lacking any flavor. I wish they would have taken time to get this right. WTP = what the Pho  Positive note is that the staff was friendly.  I had my friends whom went with me a text me that they are Hangry because of the didn't have a good experience.   I hope you guys get it right some day.",

Wanted to order takeout so I called ahead, 5 times and no one answered. When I got there there were 4 waiters, a bartender and a half full house so it wasn't clear to me why the phone couldn't be answered. Even after I walked in I had to scout out a person to place my order.   While I waited I went down to total wine and took my time perusing the aisles. I picked out a nice wine to complement my dinner and then went back upstairs to retrieve my food. When I arrived, I had to find someone again to give me my order.   The Pho itself was just okay. Not bad just not wonderful. I think it's not a bad choice if you're in the area. But the service fell short. If you want excellent Pho and service. Try Lang Van on Shamrock.",

The pho soup after putting in basil and lime is delicious and refreshing (les greasy than pho soup in many other places) at the same time.   Bun Bo Hue is super delicious. Ask them to give you chili oil (it's not on the table you have to ask them for it).   Fried quails is actually great, which is surprising (out of all the Vietnamese restaurants I've been in charlotte area, only Pho Hoa besides Pho Real has matching quality of fried quails!) Very impressed!  I gave 4 stars because the service here was soooo slow. We came in at 6:30 and didn't get to leave until 8:30. And the restaurant wasn't that full the whole time! It's a shame though, because the food is very good here. Just need to bring your patience and maybe a book when you eat here :-).",

I asked one of the servers why our order was taking so long and he said he would check.  After another 5 minutes went by our server came and told us he forgot to put our order in.  It wasn't even busy.  He probably only had 2 or 3 tables he was working on.  Then after all that time he had the nerve to ask if we still wanted him to put our order in.  They didn't offer to make up for the horrible service by giving a discount or gift certificate, etc.  No supervisor, manager or owner came to speak with us and apologize.  At that point we walked out and will never come back again.  If I could give a zero I would.",

    "text": "Pros: The quality of food, price and portions are good.  There are a lot of different options in terms of size of the dish. Its also easy to customize to your taste since there a lot of meat / seafood options as well various different types of broths (beef based, pork based, spicy). The standard pho is always very good. One of the few pho places in Charlotte that has glass noodles and you can always ask for extra noodles. The summer rolls are vegan friendly (if need be) - shrimp, tofu, pork or chicken options available. The quail appetizer is always very good as well. Lots of different boba flavours. I tried the green tea today and it's perfect for a cold rainy day - definitely enough to share between two people. Overall for flavor I give this place a 3.5/5  Cons: I've been going here for about 8 years now. The service has deteriorated quiet a bit over the years. Expect to wait longer than the norm after being seated. It takes a little bit of time for someone to come get your drink order. Also, I don't think they keep track of the order of customers being seated. The last three times I have been there    people who were seated after me had their drink order taken before mine. So while the food is good, don't expect to go here for a quick dinner. Also if you ask for chili oil or any other sauces, don't get frustrated if it takes them a little while to get it to you or if you have to ask multiple times before someone finally fulfills your request. It's just the vibe of the restaurant. Just enjoy yourself, don't rush.  For service I would give them a 2.5/5.   This is not necessarily a con, but it states on Yelp that there is Free WiFi at Pho Real. There isn't. So if you're planning on studying while you're there this isn't the place.",

Always the same portion with the same amount of meat and noodles every time. The flavor is great and very therapeutic if you are suffering with a cold. The waitstaff is helpful if you have any questions regarding the ingredients in pho and help you formulate a pho bowl to your liking. My favorite meat is probably the meatballs and I like the seafood but wish they were a little more generous in that aspect. All in all, I'm a fan and highly recommend to those who've never tried pho before!",

Never ate there since, but I wanted a vermicelli bowl and asked friends online to see where I can get the best vermicelli in Charlotte and they recommend Pho Real.   I ordered to-go that time though.  But a few days ago, my little family decided to dine-in during lunch, it was just the same as it was 5 years ago. Pho was bland, the combination soup was really bland and the papaya salad is not the one you would think it is (soy sauce vinaigrette and beef jerky? Yup!) The only good dish was still the vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls. Oh, their Thai Tea was bomb too!  I would only go back for their vermicelli. Try it, you'll be in love! The only downside is that, I wish they put the vermicelli in a bowl instead of a plate. It would be easier to mix all ingredients.",

All of their spring rolls that I have tried have been just as good as any other place I've been.   I love that they offer several sizes of pho and I always get a small order because I never can finish the larger sizes.

Being that it was Labor Day, lots of places were closed... so happy to find this place open.   Came in around 9ish. The place was still very busy so that's a good sign. Got seated within minutes.   Service was great! Girl that helped us was very friendly and helpful. Food took slightly long to come but it was very worth it!   Cha Gio was skinny, but tasted very good. Perfect appetizer size, meaning you can enjoy it and still have room for your meal.   Also got their small bun bo hue. I must say that it is awesome that they give you the option of smaller portions. I felt that the small Bun Bo Hue was the PERFECT size for me. It was delicious, and I would have drank every drop of the broth too if it wasn't for the fact that I'd rather leave room for my Beer Lao.   Cool decor, lots of little details that hints at Vietnam's history/culture but at the same time very modern and trendy music/atmosphere. They have a cool bar too!   Prices are awesome!!!! Very reasonable.   Highly recommended!!!!!",

I was meeting a friend so I thought suck it up. I was greeted and seated as soon as I walked in the door. The waiter asked abt my drinks and brought them out quickly. I waited about 10 mins for the waiter to get my order, which was the PhoGa (chicken) thin noodles and the just right bowl and shrimp spring rolls. The food was ok. It wasn't as flavorful like Vietnamese Grille. My friend had Pho Nam (beef flanks) thin noodles and crispy egg rolls with shrimp and chicken. We both agreed we like our other spot better.",

You can add a plate of thinly shaved beef that cooks in the broth and a plateful of \"extras\" has mint leaves, jalapenos, lime, and bean sprouts. It's quite the combination.",

    "text": "I live nearby and the 2 star rating is based on 10+ visits. Most unfavorable experience is with their waiters. I tip them regular base 15% and I expect much better service. I won't be their place anymore.   Things I have experienced with this place:  1) Go there lunch time around 1:30 PM for three times on week days, wait 5-10 min for waiter came to ask what to eat today, wait another 30+ min for the noodle while the restaurant is only 70% full.   2) Go there 8:00PM later for four to five times on week days, speed is normal, wait 15min and get the dish. I order same noodle same size, they actually put less things than they did in lunch time, politely point out that to their waiter and they say they just put less soup and it looks 'less'. Highly suspecting they are kinda run out noodles and meats and don't want make new before they close door.  3) One time when I found there are too little soup for train size - large size bowl and my large size looks no difference with friend's just right - mid size bowl, I ask waiter add soup and guess what? Waiter told me extra soup (refill soup) is charged. I can not believe they just say it... Totally out of my expectation  4) Another time I was in at lunch peak, I and my friends, four people, their waiter arranged two other guests came in later than us order first and let us wait. No excuse, there are a lot of table available at the time. Waiters not professional.  [JUST ABOUT FOOD]: Food itself is good. Above medium around Pho noodle restaurants I have visited at Chicago, DC, Denver and Charlotte.  [ADVICE TO MANAGER]: Hire more waiter and chef for peak hours. Train your waiter to be professional. Treat your customer fair, okay?",

I'm usually more a fan of fried spring rolls (which they have) but these are fantastic.   I also get the basic vegetarian fried rice dish. It's cheap and unbelievably good. It really has some kind of magic ingredient in it and I wish I knew what it was. If you put a bit of their hoisin and srirachi sauce on it, good lord, it's stellar.   The service is great too, especially this one guy, I don't know his name but he's always smiling and has a calm quiet demeanor. Fantastic waiter.

The gi cun were excellent and came with their own house sauce, instead of the traditional plum sauce, which was spicy and delicious. Not sure what was in it but very nice. It came with a slice of carrot at the bottom which added a very nice crunch to it.  My h tiu was delicious but it didn't have enough meats. I think I found maybe a couple of shrimp and two slices of pork, but mostly it was noodles.   Nothing out of the ordinary here, just good food.",

I just had a bowl of take out Pho for the first time. This is not just the first time I've had Pho from Pho Real, but the first time I've had it at all.  All I was really wanting was a decent bowl of soup for lunch and boy did I get a lot more than that. I've never had such a fresh bowl of soup when getting it to go before. They actually give it to you in the separate components so it all stays fresh until you mix it yourself. Don't think it's work because all you have to do is pour it all together, but it keeps everything from getting soggy and it keeps the meat from overcooking. Yes, they even give you the meat raw, but it is sliced SUPER thin, so as soon as it hits the hot broth it starts to cook to a beautiful rare.  I opted for the Tai Pho with just the thinly sliced eye round steak with thick rice noodles. The meat was so tender it seemed to melt in my mouth. The freshness of every ingredient was amazing.  A big sprig of super fresh basil, some lime wedges, some kind of fresh sprouts, a few slices of some green chiles and perfectly cooked rice noodles come together with the deep, rich broth and the thinly sliced beef to make a soup that was just amazing.  I ate the whole bowl so quickly I was shocked because they give you a good portion. I got the Vua, or just right size, and it was.  I can't wait to actually go have a meal in their dining room. They have a bar and there was a pretty big crowd already eating lunch when I picked mine up, which was barely after 12, noon, so the word is obviously out that this place is good.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now and it was awesome both times. I ordered the pho dac biet which is like the combination bowl. It has stuff like tendon, meatballs and slices of beef. It was delicious but if you aren't terribly adventurous you can order a bowl of pho with just slices of beef.   I love that they offer 4 sizes of bowls of pho. You can get a small, medium, large or extra large portion. They have special names for the sizes but I don't remember all of them. The biggest is called the train and it is enormous.   They have amazing appetizers like fresh spring rolls, papaya salad, and lotus stem salad. I adore the lotus stem salad. It's so fresh and crunchy.   They offer more than just pho but so far that's all I've ordered for a main dish. I'd like to try their vermicelli bowls next time I go. They have delicious bubble tea there also. There are just so many options here that you're bound to find something you love.",

The first few times I went there, their broth wasn't hot enough or their broth wasn't flavorful, even after adding more ingredients which made it worse. Afterward, it started tasting good. Reasons why I go there is because it is near where I live; otherwise, I would go to a different pho restaurants. Sadly, one time I had a fly in my bowl of pho so beware. I did get a new bowl and luckily I only took a few bites before I found the fly. Hey, they could have given me a free bowl and refund but I didn't complain since they didn't. Would have been nice though, what'd you guys think?",

I genuinely considered sending back my food, it was lacking in flavor and going overboard with an abundance of tendons and cow stomach. If that's the sort of thing you enjoy eating then fine, but I am positive there are places that make it a LOT better than this. We barely ate a third of our meal before grabbing the check and getting out of there. Save yourself the time and just find somewhere else.",

The serving sizes are perfect and all the ingredients are fresh and just... ya know, YUM!!  Love the staff, they are always friendly and helpful. Haven't had any issues in Pho Real that I can think of, aside from the walk up the stairs outside to get there :)  I have eaten in but mostly pick up my order.

The Pho dac Biet and Hu Tieu Mi are really good and you're even given the opportunity to add extra meat (you can't beat that).  The fresh spring rolls are some of the best that I've had in Charlotte, the rolls contain both pork and shrimp.  As for value, you can't beat a medium sized bowl of Pho, spring rolls and a beverage for around $15.  For those that aren't very comfortable with the soups, they also offer a variety of other dishes.  The chicken, beef or pork with broken rice dishes are very good.  Service is very attentive and friendly, I can't remember a single instance where my water or beverage has ever ran low.  The waiters are also very patient and willing to answer any questions that you have about the dishes or how to pronounce anything.",

This place is in a shopping center area and is on the second level so you need to climb a few stairs or use the elevator. Service was very good and the prices very reasonable. I started with the spring rolls with shrimp that came with this spicy peanut sauce that will make your bollocks tingle. In fact I saved the remainder of the sauce to use on everything else they brought me. Also had the green papaya salad which was unreal good. Slightly tart, citrus and spicy at the same time crunchy. Then had the chicken wings which were like little baby wings crispy fried with a spicy sauce to dip them in. Very, very good. Finished with the medium size pho bowl of the house special with beef, meatballs, tripe and whatever else they put in there along with those thin noodles and fresh basil and bean sprouts to add yourself plus chillies. The broth was flavorful but neutral mild so you could add what you wanted. I hit it with sriracha and some of the left over peanut sauce and wow, so many flavor levels it was like getting a lap dance on my tongue. Overall loved this joint. Will go back whenever I'm in the area.",

    "text": "Well in short one of the worst experiences we ever had in the whole world. Restaurant business is not just about serving food. It is food + service. And some people tend to forget the latter.  We entered the place and the hostess wrote our names down and told us there is a 15 min wait. Well and good, no problem. Then time goes by, and we observe customers arriving after us without reservations are seated before us even though we were just two. Small and larger groups were continuously being seated before us. Then finally when I asked about our turn, another hostess assumed we just got there and then finally seated us. On being taken to a table we were asked if this was ok. We noticed that another booth was empty beside that so we said we'd like that. And that's where she seated us. So that's the first seat we got and chose. But we realized that we were directly beneath the AC vent, which was extremely cold. By that time the crowd had thinned and more seats were opening up. So we requested whether the temperature can be turned up or if we can move to a different seat. By that time another server turned up and with a very condescending and rude tone asked us, \"You guys wanted to move? Then move. Hurry, right now! Just move, and we can't do anything about the AC. We are very busy. You guys already moved three times!\" (Are you serious?) I have no idea how someone can say it that rudely. Being busy can never be an excuse. If a restaurant is busy then that's good for them. But if they get stressed and are unable to handle the larger flow of patrons in busy hours, that certainly shows untrained or uninterested servers and bad service. Being rude because they are busy, I don't get it. Long story short, it turned into a full on altercation. The manager was also notified but ultimately we decided to eat as it was already very late.  Now to the food. We ordered Pho and fried rice. Well, the Pho was definitely not noteworthy. The fried rice also did not taste good. We also asked for the fried rice to be without peas, but we were served with peas. By that time we were like, whatever, we'll just do with it. There are places in Charlotte where you can get a lot better Pho, trust me. I can tell you if you ask me. But anyway, we paid full price and also included a tip. Should we have done that? Well, this is one place we certainly would not like to visit again and we advise you against it too.  Oh and I realized I can't give negative stars, so forced to give one star.",

I know this isn't traditional but usually something pho restaurants have - we don't eat beef or pork. They did have a veggie broth one though.   Had the shrimp spring rolls which were fresh and flavorful. My husband had the grilled chicken and I had the lemongrass chicken. My son was pleased with just plain noodles. They even brought him a sampler to try.   Food took a really long time to come out. They never cleared our plates despite the stack we kept making.

Otherwise, you'll be forgotten.   Frankly, seems it took everyone a while to get served their meals. Digressing - price is reasonable for pho. It's the first time I've had the traditional pho with tripe, etc. I'm not thrilled about it. The pho lacked flavor. However, there were other meals that looked delightful. I'll try the restaurant again with hopes to have a better experience.",

    "text": "Tucked away behind the grand promenade (Think the Walgreens @ WT Harris and Tryon), Pho Real is the real deal when you want a delicious, filling broth bowl at a great price!  The restaurant itself is quite open and spacious. They've decorated with vivid colors and contemporary lighting, definitely not extravagant but I'm here for Pho not brunch at the Four Seasons! It is clean, appealing, and inviting; more than good enough for me.  First timers are most likely going to be drawn to the 'Most popular Bowl' and while that is a solid choice, I prefer the more savory broth that comes with the Hu Tieu (Pronounced Who-Two). It's a blend of many different stocks and feature slices of chicken, seafood, and pork pieces with your choice of noodles.  Start with the \"Just Right\" size bowl and if you're still hungry afterwards the prices are affordable enough to get something else like the Grilled Pork Spring Rolls. The larger size bowl they call the \"Train\" is big enough to make a wedding cake with. Seriously, I didn't know restaurants could get ceramic bowls that big, like 'family size salad' big!  Other than the Pho and other broth offerings, I have given their Fried Rice dish a try as well and it's very good, but for newcomers just 'go with the Pho!'  Bubble Teas are very good, I wasn't a big fan of the tapioca balls as first, but I don't know, it's growing on me...yeah I'm a fan somehow. I get the Strawberry bubble tea every visit now. For the adventurous, they have a Durian Flavored one... I'm not that adventurous!  I'm trying to break the habit I have of not getting Pho at other restaurants, because these guys have set the bar for me. If I can't break it, eh... I'll live!",

    "text": "After being away from home for a few days, homesickness was hanging like a heavy cloud over my head until I stumbled upon Pho Real Vietnamese Restaurant and Bar. Like a ray of sunshine, a big smile curved at the corner of my lips as the familiar smell of pho wafted around me.   Walking in, I was impressed with the modern decor that consisted of red booths, fairy lights around the walls, and a full fledged bar. The menu itself is a tiny booklet with great explanations of various types of Vietnamese food offered such as pho, hu tieu, and broken rice plates. It was really neat to read all the descriptions, making it extremely reader friendly to everyone, especially those who have never had Vietnamese food before.   To share with my coworker, I ordered for us an order of nem nuong, fresh spring rolls with pork, and for an entree I got the small bowl of pho with chicken and thick, rice noodles. I even got myself a bubble tea, lychee flavor to be exact. This was definitely the closest to home I could get in North Carolina!  The nem nuong came out first on a nice clean plate with a small bowl of peanut sauce. Prepared in twos, my coworker and I each grabbed one and noted how nicely tight the roll was wrapped. The rice paper was soft and the pork was lightly pan fried, adding a crispness that provided a good variety of textures.   My bowl of pho was hot and steaming when it arrived to the table. There were LOTS of chicken in my bowl and I loved how it was all white meat that was tender and juicy. The thick noodles weren't soggy and the broth itself was light. At first, I thought the bowl was kind of small, but after sipping my bubble tea, I realized I didn't have the stomach for any more.   The lychee drink was SUPER refreshing and the smoothie-like consistency wasn't too icy. The tapioca pearls, however, were hard and didn't have any sweetness at all. They were also all clumped together which made it very difficult to suck up through the straw.  While nothing could beat a home-cooked bowl of pho, Pho Real was definitely real enough for me. Even though it did make me want to call my family ASAP, I'm super thrilled that I got to have a little taste of home away from home.",

This place was full of scumbags and all you can hear constantly is the F-word and sheeeeyyitt.  I ever heard the phrase \"fo' real\" being used repeatedly.  That's like wearing a Rush t-shirt to a Rush concert...you just don't do it.  Seriously though I've never been legitimately turned off to a restaurant because of its customer base.  The 1 star rating was hardly even due to the above though...  The food might have been okay on a different day, but it took forever to get our meal, and then the pho was luke warm.  It was so cold that the beansprouts didn't soften and none of the flavors from the other ingredients infused.  The waitress didn't give us the opportunity to ask that they microwave our soup.  Which brings me to the service...  One girl took our order, a guy brought our food, and a different girl brought the check.  When they came to the table, they were so hurried, you couldn't say anything to them.  We never got refills.    Forget this place.  Go anywhere else.  They had one job, and that was to bring us hot pho, and they couldn't.",

Onions, zucchini, cauliflower. So yummy and creative! The entrees are excellent, I've tried many. And their summer rolls, wow. Try them with chicken instead of shrimp, you'll love it. Their fried tofu is super yummy as well. And the avocado milkshakes, oh man. Icing on the cake.  Customer service is great. However, I will say, the food does take a while to get to you. I usually eat here for about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. The larger your group the longer the wait. Once I ate here for two hours, lol! But the food is always super so I do not mind.",

Well today they clarified one chicken and one veggie but when I got there the guy that was checking me out asked if I wanted any tofu with my veggies and I said no I just ordered veggies.... he then tells me \"I think they put tofu in it\".. they did. He goes and takes back my order for them to remake it. I get no apology no discount no anything. He gave me my food and said \"have a nice day.\"  The principle of the matter is I deserved an apology for the inconvenience. When someone calls in an order to go they should not have to sit and wait for the order to be remade. If there was any confusion or questions about my order they should've been asked on the phone not when I got there and ready to pick up and leave...",

The beef broth is perfectly spiced and pairs well with all the meat and noodles in the soup. They give you bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime and Thai basil as condiments to drop into the soup for that burst of freshness. It's never too hot to get Pho! Or so I thought until I came in on a hot Friday evening expecting regular air conditioning in the restaurant. It was actually warmer inside the place than outside! I think the pho was worth it but not everyone would like drinking hot soup in a hot restaurant. Hope they fix the AC soon.",

We received awesome service!   All of our food was fresh and hot when it arrived at our table. My husband and I shared an order of egg rolls and loved the spicy sauce that it came with. He then ordered the pho and I had the stir fry rice noodles. I loved the fresh veggies and abundance of shrimp in my dish. The overall flavor, though, fell a little flat for me. I added some of that yummy, spicy egg roll sauce to it and that helped. My husband enjoyed his pho and finished the bowl.

The wait just to have a server come greet us was 7 minutes. We ordered appetizers when our waters were dropped off- 40 minutes and counting for those to arrive.  The AC is clearly struggling the entire table is shaking and it's warm inside.  We expressed our wait time and not once did someone say they apologized  The table next to us waiting an hour for their food. Again no one apologized to them.  The host staff was not accommodating to those waiting and telling them \"when the next table is ready\"  The lack of hospitality here was unbelievable, try some training and cleaning! Good luck- we are on our way to find a new favorite place.",

First time having pho, and didn't know there were so many options of meats, noodles, etc.  The waitress was great at explaining everything, and helped us decide what to try.  Hot and flavorful broth with lots of meats & noodles.  The servings are pretty jig, too!",

I always get the rice and grilled pork and the pork is always grilled to perfection with the tastiest sauce and spices on top. It's my favorite place to find my favorite dish com thit nuong.   The only reason I'm docking this place a star is because the servers could use just a little bit more training when it comes to customer service. I feel that they don't put customer service at the forefront but it doesn't really dampen the experience, but would definitely enhance it if they did.",

Great ambience with a modern eclectic look and  A BAR!  The crispy egg rolls are tasty offering a chilli pepper sauce. They offer 4 different sizes of pho. I opt for the little size and it was enough. My chicken pho was very delicious.  However, my husband ordered the popular pho dac biet and wasn't impressed.  The broth was bland.  Also they don't serve cilantro. I got to have cilantro!  Overall the customer service and food was okay.  Next time in town, will try another restaurant.",

The roll was ok but not stellar and the broth of the Pho was rather bland but once I added some seasoning to it, it was good. But not sure if I will be back. I go to pay my bill which was like 14.65 and I get shorted on my change but I got my 5 ones.  It's kind of a pet pieve of mine when people make decisions with my money.

    "text": "Let me begin by saying I used to love Pho Real. It was absolutely my favorite place to get pho in town and also was my favorite restaurant in general.  However, after going there today, that has changed. I had many friends tell me it had gone down hill in quality of service and food as of recently but I didn't believe it and went anyway. When my boyfriend and I first got there we were approached by a less than friendly man who basically sat us down and went away for 15 minutes while we sat there without a drink. Finally, a girl came over and took our drink order. We told her our drink order and then ordered our food as well since we didn't want to wait even longer. I ordered what I usually do- the garden vegetable soup in the \"just right\" size. Usually that size is more than enough and loaded with flavorful broth, plenty of noodles, and tons of veggies.  My boyfriend ordered just the most popular traditional pho in the \"just right size\". Our orders came in a timely manner but when they got there I looked down at my bowl and it was very little broth, a bit of rice noodles, and hardly any veggies.  When I say hardly any veggies, I'm talking like one slice of carrot, two slices of zucchini, and a single broccoli floret. On top of that, the broth wasn't as flavorful as it usually was. Luckily, my boyfriends food was fine.   All in all, I am disappointed by the level of service we got and the food I received.  I'm unsure what happened to Pho Real but I suggest looking at the recent reviews before you go. I wish I had gone to another pho place and paid the same amount for more food, better service, and better quality.  If you want a suggestion of a better pho place to try out, try iPho off of Park Rd.",

I had a good deal of intestinal difficulty after eating here - probably due to the (my fault, I ate it) congealed chili oil.  The ph was gluton-ey and stuck to the bottom of my bowl. Bad experience overall due to that.  The food generally tasted good while I was there, though the fish sauce was too sweet. The waitstaff was very attentive and asked me several times if I needed more water or sauce.  I got the Pho ga. By the end of the meal, we, collectively (two of us) had a mound of gristle 2\" by 4\".  That said, the broth was *great* and probably as good as that from Pho Ha in Greensboro.  The noodles are not so good.  They stuck together at the bottom of the bowl.  All in all, if you want a good bowl of Pho, stick to Vietnam Palace on South Boulevard.",

We tried shrimp and chicken .. It was pretty good . However 2 of my friends who are vegetarians they tried out the 'Stir fry tofu with vegetables' and it was'nt really good.. This restaurant is  not really a good option if you are a veggie ( though they do have a vegetarian menu ).. Overall a good place to try out something different .. Recommended but not for veggies ( I had to take away 2 stars for that , else it was good )..",

    "text": "I work at the University, and this is one of our department's tried and True places to take visitors.  It's upstairs in the little strip mall next to Total Wine on WT Harris.  The inside is a little more modern and trendy-looking than the usual Charlotte pho joint, and everything's usually clean and pretty.  The menu is pretty standard. Things they do particularly well include the stuffed chicken wing appetizer, the pho, the vermicelli dishes with grilled meat, and the always-tasty young coconut juice.  They have an unusual (for around here) green papaya salad that's topped with peanuts and some kind of shredded dried meat.  Also good, if you're in the mood for that kind of thing, is the royal fried rice, which comes with chunks of every type of meat, plus pineapple.  The fresh rice noodle stir fries are good as well, but they're a lot for one person to eat.  I especially appreciate that they sell the pho in a \"little\" size that's about right for lunch, as well as the usual huge honkin' bowl you'd get elsewhere.  Make sure you get your pho with tendon for extra chewy goodness; I also have them substitute glass noodles for the rice noodles and have never had a problem with my noodles falling apart as one person mentioned.   Service can sometimes be frustratingly slow.  I give this place a four, though, because everyone I take there seems to enjoy it and I've never eaten anything there that wasn't good -- even if I sometimes have to stand up and look real impatient to get the check.",

When we got upstairs we were allowed to seat ourselves. The waiter was very friendly, however, he forgot to bring our appetizers and the service was painfully slow. The Pho was just as good as any other place that I have been to. It was steaming hot and tasty!! After we finished, we waited around for our check and waited a while for the waiter to pick up the money. I eventually was able to find him but it took a while to get our change back. If the service had been speedier, I would have given this place another star.",

Portions were a little smaller, but the flavor made up for it. My one issue was that all the meat seemed a little tough. The brisket was just as firm as the flank steak, and the tendon was less jelly and more sinew. I am nitpicking however, and everything tasted really great!",

I've just had pho too many times to count so I have a comparison. I ordered the fried rolls which came out hot and jam packed with stuffing. The dipping sauce wasn't quite as sweet as the sweet and spicy sauce every place gives with rolls. I was hungry, forgive me for being a glutton. I followed them up with the beef pho with raw slices and thin noodles. It smelled good and like others have said was a little bland. I doctored it up with toppings and went on ahead to shovel it down. I ordered a lychee water to go with my meal which was super refreshing. It's just syrup and water but for $1? I gave it a go. They have lots of drinks but knowing I wanted to go to the tea place downstairs kept me from ordering a bubble tea. The server was nice and quick. As soon as I sat down, he swung by and asked if I was ready to order. I thought this was odd and said I needed time to look at the menu until the table next to me sat down and was ready immediately. It might just be a repeat place for most people so they already know what they've come to order. Nothing wrong overall, but it was \"just ok\".",

Another 30min went by and the people who came after us got their food first. We finally decided to leave and go somewhere else. I went as talked to the manager who offered us the meals on the house but we were done by that point. One of the waiters decided he'd join the conversation and he  explained that and I quote \" we are busy and the large party ahead of you took extra care, everyone has to wait\". So don't go during peak hours because they can't handle it and stopping by your table to let you know the situation is above the customer service they can offer. I was glad he said that because then it became clear they don't care.   FOOD: The food is  average and decently priced. The combination pho is probably the best and they have various sizes depending on how much you want. They have a good and varied drink selection. I'd give a try to one of their house specialty drink that are always changing.",

The broth had scallions and cilantro in it already but they brought a plate of mung beans, Licorice leaves, and lime wedges.

But Pho Real seemed like a safe bet for tasting Vietnamese food based on the recommendations of co-workers.  I've been twice in the past 3 weeks and I'm equally impressed with the service and food.  On both occasions, I ordered the delicious lemongrass chicken.  It's a sweet and spicy dish with grilled chicken, onions (and lots of 'em), zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  This heaping dish is served with clumpy white rice.  The flavor is out of this world!  On the first trip, I ordered a Jasmine tea and on my last trip, a mango-flavored bubble tea.  The bubble tea is more like a smoothie/slushie with tapioca balls at the bottom...yum yum!  I felt like a kid again.    On both trips, I was promptly seated.  The server was proactive in asking if I had any questions about the dishes and regularly checked on me.  My parents, who had not eaten Vietnamese food previously, joined me for the second visit.  I explained to Hannah, the owner, and she was very gracious in explaining the menu options.  After they decided on pho, she brought out the \"fixings\" (lime, mint leaves, bean sprouts) and suggested how they should enjoy an authentic pho.  No condescension or impatience on Hannah's part, I'm really impressed by that.    The interior is pretty awesome...green walls and velvet seats. Definitely, a night lounge vibe but none of the pretension.  If you've never eaten Vietnamese food, Pho Real is a nice on-ramp to fulfilling meal...for real. (Ha ha, real pun-ny!!!)",

    "text": "I went to Pho Real alone and sat at the bar.  I had excellent service.  Maybe it was because I was at the bar?  Everyone else seems to have terrible luck with service.  This is one type of food I don't know much about, but the Pho was tasty.  I bought the combo Pho (which said most popular on the menu)  and was quiet pleased with the broth.  The meat was just ok in the Pho.  Another positive was the price.  I felt it was very reasonably priced.  It has a very cool and trendy ambiance.  Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "My 1st Vietnamese experience and my girlfriend took me to Pho! She works down the street so the people in there know her by name and order, so I went with her recommendation of the chicken and shrimp broth with thin noodles. We added the red rooster sauce (scriacha?) and YUM! While I was fearing something very salty, what I got was a delicious, warm meal that filled me up without making me feel like a total grease ball (see chinese food) or rice ball (see Rusan's sushi buffet). It was a little tough for a beginner like me to figure out how to use chopsticks AND the spoon/ladle utensil but I got the hang of it and enjoyed the experience. We added lime juice and bean sprouts and I would definitely try more Vietnamese food after this experience!",
