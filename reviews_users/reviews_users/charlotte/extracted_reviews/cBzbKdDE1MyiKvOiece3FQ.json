My husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich and...as you can see from the picture, it looked NOTHING like the photo online. Right side is their online presentation, left side is what we got. I ordered the falafel sandwich and it was meh. Who puts thick chunks of pickle in falafel sandwich? Mr. Geero's was/is so much better. My daughter got the ravioli and it was just OK. I dunno, maybe their pizza is good? We won't find out, so disappointing.",

Can't wait to go back and try the pizza. They seemed to be doing a brisk takeout business. Prices were fair, too.",

Last time, everything was ready on my order and I was waiting on my pizza - when I got the pizza home, it wasn't particularly warm, like it had been sitting in the back, not like it had just come out of the oven.

My favorites are the Specialty Chicken Pizza, Hummos, MatabelI and all the little pies with my favorite being the Zaater Pie.  I would suggest ordering extra pitta to go with the Hummos and Matabell, as you really don't get much, but they give good portions on the dips.  The first time we went, back in September, there was frustration about trying to call in an order and nobody picking up the phone.  The restaurant is very close so I drove over and it was very busy and they just opened.  I am so glad we have this new restaurant so close to home.  It was well worth the wait because the food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable.",

    "text": "My in-laws suggested Salam for dinner on December 23, as it was a newer place to go eat in town.  Walking in, it's very pleasant, with bright cheerful walls, and a few tables and a couple of booths to sit down and enjoy a meal.  The menu isn't just Greek food, it has more Middle Eastern cuisine, plus pizza. The menu choices reminded me of a couple places back home (i.e. Laylas, Fairfield, CT).  The owner, Betty, greeted us, was very friendly, and she herself brought our dinners over after a long wait from ordering. There was only one waitstaff who was very nice, but I know she had nothing to do with the longer than normal wait for food ordered. We found out it was Betty's husband who was preparing and cooking all food orders....since it is a newer place, help is needed in the kitchen (need at least 2-3 per shift), and certainly another waitstaff to not only make sure the customers are taken care of while dining in, but also to get the phone for take-out orders. One waitstaff is not enough.  There was even a Help Wanted sign in the window...for all positions!  Now....for our dinners! My mother in law enjoyed the kibbie, with tabbouleh and tzazkiki sauce, topped with some pomegranate seeds. My father in law thought the kufta was very tasty. My hubby ordered a small cheese pizza, and really enjoyed it! He likes to try pizza whether we go, and he declared this to be the best pizza that he's had in NC!  I enjoyed the beef shwarma sandwich, which came with a side salad (wish there was more lettuce, way too many chopped tomatoes!).  I definitely would go back here next time I'm in NC, they just need to improve upon getting more staff to help in the kitchen especially since the food is delicious!",

    "text": "Not super impressed but not a total disappointment either. The pizza is of decent flavor and an excellent low price - the price to quality ratio is a positive one. I've also had the \"hummus with meat\". The naming is rather vague - they should add \"lamb\" to indicate what kind of meat. This is an unusual combination as I imagine lots of folks eating hummus are not meat eaters. I am a meat eater however and yet the meat just added more oil to the dish that already had plenty of oil from the hummus itself. It was an unfortunately very acid-reflux inducing dish. The pita that came with it were not toasted and were actually chewy - maybe they forgot to do something to them? Lastly, the price of the dish was not so great at nearly $10.  Service was no problem at all - they mostly keep their distance. It's the kind of place where you order at the counter and find a table. They bring the food to your table and then the rest is up to you. The restaurant is clean, quaint and quiet and sort of \"out-of-place\" in this northwest Charlotte Food Lion shopping center. I would probably not go back again as I was not particularly impressed with quality or price.",

Their pizzas are actually quite good, however, their meat and cheese pies are really nothing more than a slab of dough with a small amount of topping on it. I have yet to try any of their weekday specials, but I'm holding out hope that they are more along the lines of their pizza quality.",

    "text": "We went here three times.The first time the food was amazing. It was nicely presented and was fresh! But it still took over 25 mins from when we order till eating.  The second time we went in to order and they told us they had sold out of the Friday special at lunch! Okay so make more? It was 6pm and there was more people behind us wanting the special. We ordered something else but was unhappy because we waited a week for the Friday special.  The third time we ordered to stay. They took (im not kidding) over an hour to make our order. They bagged it up and handled it over. We said that we were staying and unpacked the food at the table we had been sitting and waiting at. The order was missing food. When we asked they said 'oh yea, we're out of that' for two items and no other remedy was offered. We didn't like how they tried to short us on the food assuming it was a to go order and that we would have taken it home without it being right.  My fiance said never again due to the dishonesty of the workers.  I gave 3 stars because the food is good but they run out of the specials on busy nights and the wait time is unbelievably long. We just can't afford to spend that much time waiting for dinner. The couple next to us called in the order and they were still waiting in the booth for an additional half hour after they arrived.",

The sauce, the dough, the way it was cooked, all of it was not good. I will not be trying this again.",

    "text": "My new favorite, local Mediterranean place!  Short version: Haven't had the pizza but the mediterranean food is delicious! Somewhat of a longer wait for the food but well worth it for the freshness and authenticity.   Long version: I have ordered from here before but wanted to give them another try before reviewing. My review is based on take out only.  I ordered a Chicken Shawarma Plate with Baba Gangouj and Hummus (they were out of Tabulleh), an order of Fried Kibbeh with tzatziki and hummus, an order of grape leaves and a baklava. Everything in my order was amazing! All the dips were absolutely on point. The chicken shawarma was very well seasoned. The kibbeh (which I typically don't like as I don't like lamb) was just the right combination of crispy and soft.  The baklava was THE BEST baklava I have had in Charlotte. Everything tasted fresh and was truly authentic.  I will have to eventually try their pizza. I saw that they offer gluten free pizza and vegan cheese but request a 2 hour notice. For now, I am perfectly happy with the mediterranean entrees.  There is plenty of parking in the lot and they are right next to a barber shop, nail shop, Food Lion and CVS so you can even get some errands done while you wait for your pick up order. Sit down dining is also available; they do have about 8 tables or so but most of the traffic is Bite Squad or To-go.",

Hummus is some of the best I've ever tasted. Baklava was savory sweet awesomeness. I look forward to trying their falafel next time. Great food and recipes are the cornerstone of this place. You could easily serve me this food at an Uptown establishment for twice the price.   One big caveat... service is slow by restaurant standards, so just plan accordingly. There was only one (very nice) lady working the counter & then heading into the back to prepare the food... at 1PM on a weekday, so plan on around a 20 min wait or more, even if they aren't busy. I'll be calling in my order from now on.   They have an extensive menu, almost to a fault, as they offer everything from shawarma to pizza to stromboli to wings to ravioli to tacos. My personal opinion, if they focused solely on their Mediterranean dishes that shine, shortened the name to just Salam, & hired at least 1-2 more people to help with efficiency, they'd increase sales 5x-10x.  Definitely give this place a try if you enjoy legit Mediterranean cuisine.",

We ordered the kufta with tehina, and the meat shawarma with rice and a side of hummus. Unfortunately we didn't get the hummus and got a side salad instead. The receipt wasn't itemized so we don't know if we got charged for it or not. The dishes also came with some pita.   Both dishes were super salty..the kufta with the tehina sauce was really sour and salty at the same time. The kufta made my SO's stomach hurt after taking one bite.

    "text": "PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW CAREFULLY.  I am usually not the one to give negative rating because of a specific personal issue that could be attributed to an honest mistake or say an order was messed up accidentally or, the wait time and line was too long bc they had a lot of customers or maybe was short staffed. This review is different, and I contemplated for days whether to even say anything but it's my duty to alert the public.   First of all the food is amazing, Great taste, the owner and the wife are super friendly, and the restaurant is extremely clean/great ambiance etc. Food quality is top notch, and the Ingredients are fresh!   Here is the issue and reason for the one star: price integrity   The online prices are significantly higher and marked up almost 50% more than at the store level. They do give \"10% off\" for online orders but here is the catch, even with the 10% off you end up paying significantly more. If you don't believe me, please match up the online prices with the ones in store or (the menu pictures on yelp).   The owner and his wife are well aware of these unethical practices. When I asked her about it, she shrugged it off and told me \"well it's online and we give you 10%, and it's your choice to order online\". but that 10% doesn't even make up half the difference.   Here is what gets the story more interesting and showcases that it's not a simple typo or misunderstanding, they are doing this purposefully and actually tricking/encouraging customers to order online to rip them off on each transaction. A few times I have called and tried to place an order for pickup. The lady (Latino lady, she is the owenr's wife) each time told me to go ahead and place it online so I can get 10% off and told me that pick up orders can't be called in. I didn't think anything of it and was actually thankful that she was trying to help me out and wanted her business to be more digital. Perfectly fine. That's when I found out the price gouging when comparing prices. The poor little cashier didn't know what to say when i asked we about it and the owner lady didn't come out to speak to us or explain anything.   One example is the shawarma plate is listed as $15 online but in the store it's $9.99. Even with the \"10% online discount\" you end up paying 35% more. Most businesses are encouraging online transactions to get more efficient and use technology, and often times pass on some of the savings to the customer. That is not the case in this restaurant. They are purposefully, intentionally, dishonestly ripping unsuspecting customers off. I had hoped after their dishonest practices were exposed they would fix the prices but it's still the same. I don't want anyone else to fall for this.  Again, I've always been a huge fan of this restaurant and was actively promoting it to my friends and family, but didn't know of this pricing scheme. I still think the food is amazing but integrity and dishonesty wipes it all away. That makes me wonder where else are we being cheated on: food quality? Expired products? Safety standards? If someone's integrity and honesty is compromised, nothing can be trusted",

We waited 15-20 minutes for a kebab wrap and a combo of dips that I ordered. The baba ghanouj was REALLY garlicky, but the hommus and tabouleh were pretty yummy. The fella liked his wrap, but it really was just an affordable joint to grab a quick bite.",

    "text": "Love the Pizza!! This place is a hidden gem. They also have really wonderful Mediterranean food. The owners are amazing and really work hard to please you. Pro tip, they don't put the pizza in the oven till you get there. They want it to be hot as possible for you. It only takes 6 minutes to cook  so sit back and relax or make it very clear to her that you expect the pizza to be ready when you get there and then call again to tell them to put it in while you are on your way .",

    "text": "Great little spot for mediterranean. I played it safe with a gyro as it was my first time visiting, and the gyro was great. Can't wait to go back and try some of the kabob platters. In an area just down from northlake mall that is surrounded by chains that just push out food, it is refreshing to have a local business putting out quality food and with warm service.",

    "text": "Third time wasn't a charm.  When they first opened I was super excited since they are so close to me but albeit I was dissapointed. The lady at the counter was very sweet but the dishes I tried were either very dry or to sour. I thought maybe they need time to settle and work out the kinks but the 2nd and 3rd time still didn't do it for me. (It even messed up my stomach). Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing.  They're called Salam pizza so their specialities must be pizzas...sigh. Ok fine, I've convinced myself to go for a 4th time.",

    "text": "My Wife & I are former NY'ers who used to frequent an Egyptian restaurant near what was our home in NY...so when we found Salam, we were most grateful!  The delicious chicken shwarma plate was our mainstay, yet lately we've gotten the lamb plate, which, to our surprise, is real lamb (unlike the processed stuff in other places).  Everything is fresh here; portions are generous; the restaurant is clean, and the owner who works the front is very kind.  Lately they've cut down on the amount of salt they use, which is good, as the other flavors of the food are brought out.  The fresh lemon they use on their chicken makes the plate most delicious!  I did mention my Wife & I are former NY'ers, and we're well familiar with homemade Greek desserts.  We recently tried Salam's baklava, which is among the very best we have ever had:  not too sweet nor too mild; not too buttery, nor absent butter.  Among the very best.  The only bad thing I can say about Salam, is that it's hard to be on a diet once you acclimate yourself to their food :).",
