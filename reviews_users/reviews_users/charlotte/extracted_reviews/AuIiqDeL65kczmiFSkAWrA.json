    "text": "First time for the brunch and it was very tasty. Our server was pretty attentive and had great recommendations. We had the Cranberry Creme Brulee' French toast, Crab Cake benedict and some peach bellinis. The bellini was frozen more like a margarita, yet tasty. The crab cake had high meat/low filling ratio, which we liked. The French toast was just the right amount of sweetness and was topped with strawberries, plus came with a side. Although enjoyed, we cannot make this an every weekend brunch due to the prices. It was not extreme, but $1/$2 pricier for portions. Will keep this one in the rotation.",

I put in a reservation and asked for a nice waitress so my parents could have a pleasant meal. The restaurant and the staff went above and beyond. The sous chef and the manager came out with a platter full of all the desserts they make at the restaurant and they personally thanked us for being there. The back of their business cards say it's their goal to make people feel special and that's certainly what they did. What an amazing restaurant that actually cares about their guests. I will be returning every time I'm in Charlotte !",

    "text": "Fancy atmosphere distracts you from the overpriced wine list and mediocre food.   The Good: Chicken Romano was perfectly moist and came out piping hot. Their homemade hot sauce was the best thing I had there.  The Bad: I was very offended by mass market wines (e.g. Apothic, Cline Zinfindel) that sell for $10 a bottle at the supermarket that are offered here for $10-14 a glass. The entree-sized Maggiano's salad was a mound of soggy iceberg lettuce for $15. They ran out of crispy prosciutto - 1 of only 4 ingredients in the salad - without deducting any of the cost. My eggplant parmesan was completely mushy and lukewarm.  The Verdict: Good place for a date if you care more for the atmosphere than the food, and you care nothing about wine. If you are more discerning and have $100 to spend for 2 people, there are plenty of better places to go where you'd get decent wine and real quality food.",

I couldnt finish it all so I got a box to go, my significant other got the chicken and spinach pasta, it was amazing as well, he's ordered it before and is always pleased! We also got 2 pastas to take home & a delicious slice of rich chocolate cake! All for 70 dollars!! That might seem high to some but for us, for all the food we were very pleased!

Hoping that maybe management had cleaned up their act we took a chance and made Thanksgiving Day reservations.  I always make it a practice to look for the sanitation grade before dining anywhere. Upon arrival I quickly noticed the glaring \"90\" grade. Just one point away from being a GRADE \"B\" restaurant!  Totally Unacceptable! We immediately left the restaurant and luckily found an open slot at nearby Ruth's Chris. This is clearly a management failure,. There is no excuse for poor sanitation particularly when charging first class prices.  What a shame, because in the past Maggiano's had a reputation for being a supurb restaurant with amazing Italian cousine.  Hard to enjoy that superb food when you're wondering what's going on (or not) in the preparation of your food.",

Tables are crammed together where the person behind you has to bump your chair just to get out if their seat.

When I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce off the classic pasta menu I was told that I could choose another pasta menu item to take home.  My boys were very happy to have lunch....and dinner!!!  LOTS of pasta!  :)",

Maggiano's is our go-to place for take out when we have family in town and I don't feel like cooking for the masses and everyone is always pleased.  Tonight I decided to brave Maggiano's alone.  With four children.  Props to the hostess - she didn't blink an eye and assured me she had the perfect spot \"out of the way\" for me and my brood.    I have a daughter with celiac disease (no gluten!) so Maggiano's might seem like an odd choice for us but they serve gluten free pasta!  The last time we were visiting with a rather large party, the chef even came out to check on us and see who had the gluten sensitivity and if we had any questions about food preparation.  My daughter was beaming.    Tonight I ordered eggplant parm off the classic pasta menu and currently if you order off the classic pasta menu you get to choose another pasta menu item to bring home - my working husband was very pleased to come home to DELICIOUS gnocchi in vodka sauce even though he missed our dinner out.  Drinks for myself and the kiddos came out quickly and our server was very accomodating - one of my children ordered the grilled chicken breast with garlic mashed potatoes - \"but no chicken, please.\"  The waitress thoughtfully suggested we just order a side of mashed potatoes instead.  The children's menu has a lot of variety and includes a drink and dessert with their meal - all for $5.95 - it really can't be beat.  The servings are enormous and my son is the only one who can actually finish his meal.  I am pleased to say that not only was dinner taken care of this evening, but lunch for tomorrow is covered as well.    I think our bill was about $34 - no complaints here!  Definitely check out Maggiano's - very family friendly, very helpful staff, and, of course, delicious food.",

First off let me say that the decor and ambiance was great for a romantic evening even with a local school prom going on. I gave them 3 stars only because the food is not authentic Italian. The mix an American flavor with Italian dishes. I tried their signature famous D, riggatoni and it was basically pot roast and hamburger eith noodles and beans. Not good long story short my wife an I tried 2 dishes each until we found something we liked. But the staff and manager was very friendly and knowlagebale and went out of their way to make us happy with our dishes. So again maggianos is good as long as you know it's not authentic, but I won't be eating there again.",

Oh yeah and the mariana sauce is so addictive i buy a jar at least every other month, and i cant cook lol.

    "text": "You would think big beautiful restaurant on a holiday with a pre-fixe menu would be a slam dunk. Not so much, we arrived for our reservation and were seated right away. We were seated for about 5 minutes before our server was able to get over to us. While she was getting our non-water drinks we noticed that 4 of our 7 water glasses pre-set on the table had dried on food residue and lipstick stain present. We made our server aware of this on her return and she apologized and quickly replaced the empty glasses with filled clean glasses. As we sat there she made us aware of our thanksgiving menu options and it seemed fairly straightforward. She made us aware that the bruschetta would be our right away. Imagine our surprise 20 minutes later when our salads arrived and our appetizers had not. The salad choices selected Italian Chopped and Classic Caesar, both were a bit over dressed resulting in lettuce that was a bit wilted. No biggie just a salad, we still had plenty of courses remaining. Our appetizers arrived and to say they were disappointing would be an understatement. The bruschetta bread, usually the unsung hero of the entire bite was dry and stale. The diced roma tomatoes and artichoke options both tasted as a kindergarten culinary school drop out had made them, and still failed. So at this point we are very excited to receive our entrees and notice that several of our knives on the table also were soiled with thick encrusted build up. We at that point made the server aware. She of course once again was very apologetic, and stated she would alert a manager right away. Sixteen minutes later the manager pops up and offers a half hearted apology for the dirty silverware. He asked if there's anything else he could do for us, we requested several refills and expressed concerns that our server maybe overwhelmed.   -No response-  Our refill drinks arrived and surprisingly we never saw the manager again.   Our food has now arrived and we are giddy with excitement, after two lack luster starter courses, surely the entrees would not disappoint. The turkey, very tender and juicy. The accompanying giblet gravy was a perfect compliment. The sausage dressing however was severely undercooked and tasted like mush. The brown sugar ham and whipped sweet potatoes, just like grandma used to make. The Rigatoni D, that is usually mind blowing was served with pre aldente pasta, and a sherry cream sauce that was severely unreduced.  The four cheese ravioli reminded me of a slightly elevated Chef Boyardee.   The saving grace of this meal was truly the pumpkin cheese cake. With a ginger snap crust and a creamy filling with a hint of spice. Simply incredible.   At the end of the day, we would've been more satisfied and less impacted financially if we had just gone to Golden Corral.   Next year, i'll cook at home!",

The event was amazing and Maggiano's did an excellent job with the set up of the room and all of the little details that were important to me.  My guests had a blast and commented on how nice everything turned out and how good the food was.  My only comment was the leftovers becasuse I did one of the Family Style plans.  When I got home, two tin pans full of food was not on my menu.  Don't know where it came from, but it definitely wasn't my food.  I suspect another party was happening in another banquet room and they probably ended up with some stuff that wasn't on their menu either and only realized it when they got home. Shout out to Carolina Romero (Banquet Sales Assistant) who was awesome and extremely patient.",

We had the special for the week which was a chicken stuffed tortellini with spinach, tomatos, smoked ham in a truffle butter white wine sauce that was so good!   We also had the double fudge brownie for dessert which was so good. I loved the balsamic glaze they drizzled over the ice cream and strawberries that came with the brownie.

It was a bit sad yet entertaining to see the continuous look of dread every time a server had to trek their way up those stairs with a handful of food.   Our server was very nice and personable.  He suggested the ravioli dish that was on special that came with the truffle cream sauce.  I ordered this as well as the pepperoni risotto bites. The fried risotto bites were impeccable; best I've ever had anywhere.  The creamy red sauce was a nice touch as well. The ravioli special had a nice flavor but was missing some saltiness in the sauce. The ham was a nice touch but still lacked it that burst of flavor that salt would've helped provide. The cheesecake was very rich and creamy not to mention huge.    Towards the end of the meal I found myself waiting a long with for refills, my to-go order, and the check. I was eager to leave at that point and get back to my travels but I guess the server enjoyed my company.   I would still recommend this place to folks looking for a good Italian option.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying all of my other experiences with Maggiano's have been positive. But last night was BAD.  We had a group of 9 for dinner. Calamari appetizer was good as usual. This month they have an ahi tuna dinner special. 4 people in our party ordered it. It was absolutely horrible. I told my teenager not to eat it because it literally looked like food poisoning on a plate. It was extremely over cooked. The other 3 ate around the tuna also because of how over cooked and mushy it was. My mother ordered the gnocchi with a white sauce. She described it was throw up on a plate. The sauce was either not what she ordered as it was more a very pale red (almost like a vodka sauce) and she said the gnocchi were gummy. She said it was similar to pasta that had been reheated a few times. Our waiter actually ended up removing her plate from our bill because she didn't eat any of it. My aunt and I had chicken dishes. Her the chicken parm and me the Marsala. Ours were edible but our chicken was sooooo dry neither one of us ate much. My uncle had the pasta pesto which he said was fine. And my youngest had the kids spaghetti and meatball which was ok.   Our waiter was friendly and the cocktails and wine were good. But when a meal is over $500 you shouldn't have to order food online to pick Up at the Cheesecake Factory next door after you leave b/c everyone is still starving.   I'm really hoping this isn't the new normal for Maggiano's. We've celebrated mother's/fathers days there, family dinners etc and have always had delicious meals. Let's hope things pick up again soon. Unfortunately it will be a long time before we go in to check.",

We also observed that not only us but many of the customers were not being served any food in a reasonable time.  When we did get our meal I asked the server if the pasta was made fresh, she really didn't know.  I found that interesting.    The food was hot and my spaghetti was very good . The gluten free noodle they use was just ok.  There are good gluten free pasta options on the market now.  Won't be in a big hurry to go back there soon.",

After my last terrible experience on Valentines night 2015, I decided give Maggiano's a try in hope that my Birthday experience would be better. Unfortunately it wasn't. From the waitress being slack with service and refills \"due to lack of communication\" and the food was just not good. I ordered ziti with no meat and got noodles and sauce with no flavor, my boyfriend ordered the chicken Alfredo which was extremely bland with no flavor. We ordered the Marco Meal for 2 and the best part of the meal was the starter mozzarella marinara and the apple crostada. I am extremely sad to say this was THE LAST visit I will ever waste my time or special occasion on Maggiano's. I hope they go back to their traditional values to ensure every guest has a great experience.",

There was a stream of guests walking into the restaurant before us, I thought to myself that there would be a wait. There wasn't, and we were seated quickly. Our server was warm and friendly and made suggestions when I hesitated over the drink menu.  The calamari was absolutely delicious as I had expected. The pasta was yummy and I could not finish it all. I was very happy to take it home to devour the next morning for breakfast! No complaints whatsoever, I look forward to returning.",

There was a little bit of a wait on a Saturday afternoon, but we were seated fairly quickly (within 10min).  The dinning room is a massive high-ceilinged room that has a mixture of old world booths or tables.  What intrigued me the most was the staircase that lead to some of the event rooms that you can reserve for events.  We were lucky to get a booth, but it felt a little big for 2 people... more perfect for 3-4 people I guess.  Our waiters were nice and kept the water flowing.  I had a caesar salad which wasn't overly dressed and a good size.  The ridiculous size came in the food portions.... I had enough to eat for another meal - which is good because the food was very tasty.  Loved the bread and olive oil with balsamic.... that stuff will get me in trouble and basically force me to live at the gym.",

Reservation for 6:30 and didn't get seated until 6:45 (not that would be a reason to write a bad review, but that was to protend what was to follow).  We were seated and then ignored for 15 minutes until a member of our party got up and walked over to the beverage/service area which was less than 6 feet away from our table and asked the three servers standing there if anyone of them was assigned to our table.  One said no it was so and so's table and she was no wheres to be found.  He at least came over and filled our water glasses.  As we already had plenty of time to decide what to eat from staring at the menu for 15 minutes, he also took our orders.  About 10 minutes later another waitress came by and took our beverage orders. So now we've been seated for 30 minutes and just getting to be able to order a beverage.  Anther 10 minutes goes by and the appetizer arrives and it's just room temperature when it should of been hot.  A third waitress now appears and asks us how the appetizer is and we tell her it's cold and she wants to know if we want another.  No, just take this away and please credit the bill.  And now the rolls appear(the excuse is that the oven is not working so that's why it took 45 minutes for the rolls to arrive).  One member of our party had ordered a salad.  No where to be seen until we ask the third server that we are missing the salad.  She blames the kitchen for not delivering the salad.  Now a manager appears at the table apologizing for one-after-another gaffes we are expieriencing.  But from looking around at other tables, it appears we all are the victims of poor service as everyone is waiting for either food, drinks or the bill.  1 hour and 10 minutes later, the food finally arrives which was good as usual.  But the hassles of getting the food to the table is just not worth the exercise in frustration.  There are 100's of other places to eat in Charlotte and we'll be going someplace else from here on out.  We didn't know how much of a tip to leave as we never could figure out who was actually our assigned server.  Seemed like we had every staff member in the place at our table over the 2 hour meal.  And couldn't figure out if the service was bad, kitchen was under seige or the whole place was inept.  We did leave a tip larger than what I thought they deserved but since it'll be our last visit there, we chalked it up to a parting gift.",

    "text": "I went here with my husband on Saturday as part of our wedding anniversary date. It was my choice because we went last year and was not disappointed. Well, this anniversary was different. We made a reservation and really liked the table because it was small and in a corner so it gave us a lot of privacy. I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavalo and my husband had a Tuscan Shrimp and Chicken pasta dish (not quite sure of the name). When my food came out it looked delicious but it was very bland and the noodles tasted over cooked/mushy. My husband the chicken in his dish lacked flavor and was a bit chewy. Our waiter was friendly but at the end of the meal when he came over to ask how everything was my husband and I both kind of shrugged and said \"ehh\". Well he avoided that conversation by discontinuing eye contact and quickly asking if we wanted dessert. I could tell that he knew we were unhappy with our meals but didn't seem to want to deal with it. We decided not to say anything else and just go because we didn't want to put a damper on our date. While it wasn't the waiter's fault that the food wasn't good, he could have done a better job with trying to see what the problem was. Oh, waiters/waitresses when you ask your guests if everything is ok, please allow them time to answer instead of saying \"how is everything, good\" all in the same breath. Don't ask if you're going to answer for me. That is an issue I have at most restaurants. With all that being said, the food at Maggiano's is usually very good so I will chalk it up as one bad random experience.",

We ordered the 'Classic' family style, and it was delicious!  We don't have anything like that here in Hawaii, so it was a nice treat!  We ended up ordering Caesar & Maggiano's salads, stuffed mushrooms & calamari,  baked ziti, eggplant parmesan,  chicken parmesan, & chicken picatta.  For dessert, Nonna's toasted pound cake, & the apple crostada.  My husband and I have the age old problem of filling up on appetizers & salad, especially since they refill your bowls when you run out!  The stuffed mushrooms were the best I've ever had, & Cesar salad is awesome anytime of the day.  By the time the entrees came we were semi full but I loved the eggplant parmesan!    We did not feel rushed at all to hurry up and leave, we spent almost 3hrs at dinner that night.   Our table was celebrating a number of occasions, our first wedding anniversary, a college graduation & a birthday.  Our waiter gave us complementary lemon cookies for the road (but after we blew out candles!).    We most definitely look forward to return when we visit our family again on the East Coast!",

At various times be absconded with my unused napkin, half my silverware and my dinner companion 's entire place setting. Getting spelnda for my sweet tea took three requests. Then came the meal. The baked ziti in pomodoro sauce with sausage salty to the point of being inedible. The fettucini alfredo was passable, but only after the addition of some grated Parmesan after the dish arrived to thicken it and add flavor. The (unfortunate) highlight of the meal was the cheesecake which I strongly suspect was bought in and not house-made. Unfortunately, last night's trip gave me an Olive Garden experience at triple the price. I will be hard pressed to go back.",

There were 2 hostesses, one who was very accommodating and the other who was, well...not.  She spoke to us quite rudely, as if we were a burden rather than a guest.  Maybe she was just having a bad day.  No harm, no foul.  We began with the calamari.  It was good, slightly undercooked.  I've had better before.  Our waiter was fantastic and took care of our every need.  I had shrimp fettuccine Alfredo  as my entree.  To my surprise, I was asked which pasta dish I would like to take home in addition to my main course!  Shrimp was cooked beautifley.  The Alfredo was to die for.  We followed up with some dessert, something we normally do not make it to, but I sure am glad we did.  We shared a monsterous creme brulee (no need to order two) and it was I little piece of heaven, at the bottom of a ramikan.  The fresh strawberries on top brought it to the next level.overall, great food, great service, great restaurant!",

My experience yesterday was less than \"meh\"!  First of all, we walk in & it was freezing in the restaurant, like really unpleasantly freezing!   My husband & I both ordered the Italian side salad to start-  a lot of white lettuce, 4 thick red onion slices, and 2 tiny olives.....really!  Disappointed! I also ordered the Italian sausage& pasta soup ( to warm me up b/c it was still freezing cold inside).  The pasta was still hard , and had no flavor- no hint of a veggie anywhere either!  Disappointment #2. My husband ordered the Salmon Salad, and kept finding little \"hard things\" - not bones- but something else , in his salad.   (Later on, when we got home, about 45 mins after eating, my husband got violently ill - my daughter also said her tummy felt bad too!). Disappointment #3.  My son ordered a kids pepperoni pizza -  what he was served was a flatbread with sauce, a few pepperoni, and a ton of parmesan cheese on top-  that's not a Kid's Pepperoni Pizza!  Needless to say, my son refused to eat it, or have anything else!  My daughter had the kids spaghetti & giant meatball.  she loves pasta, but hated this-  she said the meatball \"tasted funny\", and wouldn't take another bite.  I tried the meatball, and it did taste \"off\"- like it was not fresh, or made with something odd...can't really describe it, just wasn't a meatball like you'd expect.   Her pasta okay, though.  Overall, I would Not recommend this restaurant.  I was really disappointed!",

However, the continental buffet was not as great as I expected.  For a restuarant that is in one of the premier malls (SouthPark) in Charlotte, with the prime location and its' reputation, I just expected better tasting food.  The buffet was not as hot as it should be,  As I walked from my table to get in line for the buffet, I noticed that the floors looked as if they had not been swept or cleaned from the last event...which may have been the night before...or days before!  The most positive thing about Maggiano's was the decor.  The dark wood and numerous dining areas made me feel better as I left! I may go back again to see if they still have the level of quality that made it a must visit years ago.",

The restaurant was practically empty and the service was extremely slow.  I had their chopped salad to start which was described as having tomatoes, bleu cheese, and prosciutto among the ingredients.  They were so sparse and tiny that it practically took a magnifying glass to see them amongst all the lousy iceberg.  A definite ripoff and disappointment.  My entree wasn't terrible--ordered off the light menu.    Even though we specified when we ordered how we wanted the checks split; at the close of the meal, we were told by our server that their system wouldn't do that and that we should pass around the master bill and figure it out for ourselves.  After getting a manager involved and quite a lengthly wait, we finally got our totals and were out of there.  This lunch experience in a nearly empty restaurant took almost 2 hrs.  All around a huge disappointment.  I definitely won't be going back!",

    "text": "I love Maggiano's on Sunday afternoon......why?  Because it seems that this is the only time that there is any space at all in this huge place.    I usually stick with the basic lasagna meal because it is a house special (eat one in - take another pasta home for lunch - all for one low price). But it is the appetizer that is over the top.  Fried Zucchini - not greasy zucchini, not small zucchini, we are talking big, huge long fried strips \"of zucchini hand battered with Japanese bread crumbs, fried to a golden brown, served with a zesty lemon aioli cream sauce.\"  This is worth the trip itself.  So, the atmosphere is open, has a large seating area, and many private rooms available for private parties.  It also features ample outdoor seating, and since it is currently winter and cold, they offer large patio heaters.  The staff is friendly, usually prompt with your request, and very helpful in suggestions.  I would recommend this location, but do yourself a favor and make reservations, walk-ins will surely wait awhile or be like me, visit on a nice Sunday afternoon.  NCFoodGuy",

We had a reservation for 9 pm but we got there at about 8:15 because we forgot that the mall was closed so we checked ourselves in and got a table within ten minutes! Although the tables are close together, we did not feel crowded. We got the Marco's Meal for Two which is an appetizer (or flatbread or two salads), two entrees (choose from the classic pastas or get the lasagna, four cheese ravioli or mushroom ravioli for an extra $2), a dessert, and two meals to take home for only $40! We got the spinach and artichoke dip, the both of us ordered the mushroom ravioli, and we ended it with the warm apple crostata. Everything was delicious! My advice is not get a cheesy, creamy appetizer and entree together. Though they were both delicious, it was a bit much. Next time we'll go for the bruschetta appetizer or an entree with red sauce. The service was also very nice. Our server was attentive and very sweet. We have no complaints about the food, service, or atmosphere! We will definitely be back!",

However, for special events or group dining (corporate dinners, seminars, or large family dinners)  this place is great.  I have been here at least half a dozen times for corporate dinner meetings and seminars and they really do an excellent job serving groups.   There are a couple of ballrooms upstairs which open up if you need a large space.  There is enough room to set up a bar in the ballroom for cocktails before dinner.   The nice thing about doing the \"family\" style dining with groups is you can have a couple of different entrees circulating each table. They typically bring out several different side dishes - veggies, pasta, etc as well.  I find the food to be average - nothing to write home about - but typical of a large corporate chain.  I have to say, service on each of my visits has been excellent. So, if you are looking for a good venue for a group dinner, give them a call!",

    "text": "Overall: Went out with a work group to Maggiano's last night.  I had a bourbon drink at the bar that was made well at a reasonable price, $8.  After the bar we were promptly seated and had good service for dinner.  We had a group of 6 and opted for the Family Style Classic dinner.  I thought this was a very good way to try different items at Maggiano's.    Price/Selections: We paid roughly $30 per person to split several appetizers, entrees and dessets.  There was more than enough food for everyone and any dish that you wanted more of the staff would bring more out at no additional charge.  This meant we  received several rounds of steak and chicken parm.  The staff was even okay with bringing out an additional main course at no charge for you to split and take home.  I feel for a chain type Italian restauant this was a good experience.  It is a little on the expensive side but since it was located in Southpark and it was for a work group this did not have a big impact on me.  Favorites:   I thought the chicken parm and moms lasagna were the best main dishes.  I thought the best appetizer we had was the calamari.  For desert we had regular cheesecake and creme brulee.  The regular cheesecake with fresh strawberries was better to me.",

The food is mostly less than average except for the appetizers.  The fried zucchini are large flat pieces with delicious light and crispy breading.  The pasta itself is overall a bit blah, and pasta I make at home generally tastes better than most pasta I've had here.  The place is huge and the service is good, so it is definitely a decent place for large groups.  They also have some killer deals if you're frugal.  If you order any of their \"homestyle\" pastas, you can another to take home for free.  They also have a dinner for two deal where you can get two pastas, two to take home, two salads, an appetizer, and a dessert for $40.    I've never gone to Maggiano's on my own accord and most likely wouldn't.  But it's a decent place for groups to go and have a good time.",

Yes, we did have a reservation, but being Valentine's night I would have been surprised if we had been seated immediately. \"Marco's meal for two\" is the best deal on their menu, so that's what we ordered, and we both got side salads, entrees, a dessert to split, and an entree each to take home! The spinach salad was fantastic- and even though it came dressed, it was not too heavy. It was also larger than I expected for a side salad. For dinner I ordered the lighter take ziti- YUM. Our entrees came out about 10 minutes after we got our salads, and our waitress actually apologized for it, saying that they had been taking much longer earlier in the evening. Well, I'd rather get my entree quicker than have to wait ages for it. our waitress that night was attentive but not hovering, and she really seemed to enjoy being there. Nonna's pound cake for dessert was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. Overall, I was especially impressed with Maggiano's on Valentine's night, and it will be hard to pick another restaurant the next time we want to go out.  Side note, the last time we went to Maggiano's the kitchen was a little slow and we ended up being comped an appetizer for the wait. I appreciate service like that.",

When I asked if I could just get the kids meal first since she was hungry, server said he would have to get them all together but he will check. Really, if a kid is hungry and we ordered 20 mins back , how long do we still have to wait???? We never got the lemon cookies that came with the kids meal when we were told we would get it at the end. It was my husband's birthday but we did not even mention about it.we ordered the pastas with chicken in it, however, there was no chicken in take home pastas..

This was around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, the bread was good, the sausage and peppers were ok , I've had much better. The salad I could not believe, I would have sent it back, but the waiter did not come back to our table until a half hour later, by that time I just pick over the salad because I was hungry. ( I could not get his attention). The salad was awful a waste of my money.",

The waffles and fruit were also really good. My husband had pancakes with eggs and honey ham. He loved the ham and eggs but he was not fond of the pancakes. I also had a sangria that was REALLY good. We probably won't come back for brunch but we will always be here for dinner :)",

What I mean by that is some of the employees are very professional and the other half are subpar.  I believe in being good with your craft and some are not.   I say at the bar which I usually do and when I walked up it was not cleaned from the last party that was there. It didn't take long for the bartender to clear it from the last bartender that was on shift.   I also witnessed some of the waiters/servers clowning around in the entry area. Kind of annoying... also had another server pacing behind me waiting to clear her check or something. She was loud and annoying in a place that is generally quiet.   Besides all this I enjoyed myself and blame it on this one occasion. Most of the time Maggiano's is legit. I feel this was a one off, just ok, experience.",

Then we told our waitress it was our first time there and at first everything seemed fine. However that all quickly went out the window. After getting our  and appetizer order and bringing us bread our waitress disappeared. This was a rare date night and I am used to being in and out of restaurants in an hour after being seated. Ha! Don't go here if you are in a hurry. The menu was pedestrian at best and the mushroom ravioli was salty. We had to flag down the waitress to get our ticket and then wait again after that for the take home meal to be brought to the table. The restaurant itself felt claustrophobic. The tables were all shoved together and the person behind me was in danger of bumping into me the whole time. So do not recommend! Don't believe the hype just because of where it is located.",

We got there and it was packed, hostess said it would be a 45 minute wait, but the bar area was first come, first serve. Luckily we found a table in the bar and didn't have to wait 45 minutes. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, my friend ordered spaghetti & meatballs. I got the spaghetti & meat sauce for the Choose one for today and one for tomorrow because I've been wanting to try their spaghetti. Since it was packed, service was a little slow. We ordered stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer, they were decent size mushrooms and flavorful. My fettucine alfredo was good, not too thick, right amount of sauce, chicken had a nice grilled flavor; too much food for me to eat, so I took the rest of it home. I've been to a couple of different locations (Denver, Charlotte, Cincinnati), nice to know each time the alfredo has been the same. The next day, I tried some spaghetti for dinner, it was really good, sauce was right consistency, not too sour, perfect amount of spice, but it was a little salty for my taste, so I'll stick to the alfredo.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I have visited this Maggiano's location several times and have had nothing but great food and service. Until yesterday (6/17/18), this was one of my family's favorite places to eat out. Something has changed drastically in the level of service AND the quality of food....at least at the South Park location in charlotte, NC on Father's Day 2018. I arrived with reservations for a party of 7 and still had to wait 35 minutes to be seated. No table was ready. When we inquired about how long we'd have to wait, the hostess, who I assumed was the Lead or Supervisor because she wore a headset, seemed irritated and very passive as she responded without even looking at us and immediately directed her attention to another group that had just come it to be added to the waitlist. Since it was Father's Day, we decided to wait instead of trying to find another restaurant that wasn't crowded. During our wait, a child vomited in the waiting area. I alerted the assumed Lead hostess that a clean-up was needed. She directed a second hostess to clean it. That second hostess used her headset to call a third person to clean it up. As we continued to wait, no one came to clean up the vomit and several customers unknowingly walked through it. About 20 minutes passed and we were still waiting to be seated. I approached that second hostess who had been directed to clean up the vomit that it was still there and that customers were walking through it. She called again to the back but no one came. By the time my party was seated, the vomit was gone but only because so many customers had walked though it.  A third hostess seated our group. She was very impersonal and also spoke to us without any eye contact. I had to ask her if she was speaking to me and if we should follow her to a table. I felt disregarded and like I was an inconvenience to all three hostesses we encountered during our visit.  Once we were seated, our waiter was really the first of the entire Maggiano's staff to smile and serve. He took time to answer our questions and was very attentive to our group. Even with the food coming out slow, he made sure to acknowledge us each time he passed our table whether he was waiting on us or not.   I do plan to visit this location to speak to the on-site Manager as I don't believe this review will make it to their eyes. Four our party of 7, our bill was just under $300. If I had been paying, I would never have stayed. I can't say that I will visit Maggiano's any time soon....not even with gift certificates or coupons. This was just unacceptable!!!",

    "text": "Poor Customer service. Good food.   Let me start my novel with we had reservations for 8:45pm. We arrived at 8:25pm. They sat us at approximately 9pm. When we walked to our table we counted over half a dozen empty tables empty, cleaned and set for customers. They sat us at a table in the back of the restaurant and as soon as we had sat down then proceed to ask us to move to an alternate table so they could push the current table and the adjacent table together for a larger party. Really after waiting you then ask us to move? Poor planning? So we sit down at new table and proceed to order a bottle of wine. The server opens to bottle table side, does not as for a taste tester (so is this supposed to be fine dining or not?). He proceeds to pour the bottle into the glasses. We had a party of four. He runs out of the wine when he reaches glass three. The kicker is he said \"I will let you guys redistribute that\". Wait what? Did you really just say that the empty glass that is sitting in front of me I should pass around the table to my friends, that by the way have already drank out of their glasses, to get them to fill my glass?!?!?! Thats just 50 shades of wrong. So at this point the Manager actually seeks us out because she had \"heard\" we may be having some issues. Well you think?!?!? We did give her the opportunity to walk away by says \"you really don't want to hear what we ha e to say\", but to her credit she stayed and listened. She did offer to get me a glass of wine on the house to make up for the miss-pour from the server and offer to get an appetizer for the table. We had already placed orders for the Marcos Meal Special which comes with apprizers, so we declined as two appetizers were already on the way. So on to the food... Appetizers: *tomato caprese - tomatoes with mozzarella cheese drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette - good *sausage and peppers - good Entree: *four cheese ravioli - I did not know it had a pesto (green) sauce? I saw it delivered to another table with red (tomato) sauce? Did not care for the green sauce, ravioli was tasty and had a generous amount of filling.  *chicken parmesan - tasty  *lasagna - tasty *chicken and spinach manicotti - tasty and had a generous amount of filling.  Dessert: *tiramisu - awesome *creme brulee - awesome With the Marco's meals we got meals to go...3 lasagna and a baked ziti. We will see how that turns out tomorrow.",

Small table in the back..okay..here for a \"romantic\" dinner with hubby...no problem.  Ishmel, our waiter, promptly comes over to greet.  Explains that things were crazy, did we mind taking it slow.  Cool with us.  We're here to enjoy our evening.    Let me say that I am a foodie and an experienced Italian food person.  Have had the real thing, the American version, the fast food version, and the extremely bad version.  I know the difference. Placed our drink order.  While we waited, received Fried Ravioli as a first time customer gift...it just was okay. Olive Garden has better. Ishmel came back for our order.  Ordered Calamari as an appetizer, my husband ordered a Caesar Salad and Chicken Alfredo.  I asked about the Veal Marsala vs the Chef's special Beef Tenderloin.  Ishmel recommended the Veal and then house wine.  Wine was excellent.  Veal was just okay.  I have had better at Portofino's and Olive Garden.  Not the best Marsala sauce.   Caesar Salad okay.  Calamari..not as good as Lotus. Just okay.  As for taking things \"slow\"...we received our appetizer and salad together, barely got that finished when the main course came out. Had good service.  They were very crowded and busy.  Food was not up to par from previous review.  Portifinos is much better overall.  So is Olive Garden.  Will not be back.  Next  time, we'll go to Villa Antonio for quality Italian food.",

The food was adequate, maybe above average by Charlotte's standards, but nothing swoon-worthy. Certainly forgettable.  I did enjoy the overall design and atmosphere of the restaurant even though the servers were less than polite, and bordered on rude.   That being said however, I wouldn't cross this off my list altogether, but instead just go there for drinks.",

    "text": "I went to this restaurant expecting a positive experience, but ended with a terrible one. First and foremost, the wine is incredibly overpriced. Some of the nicer restaurants in uptown Charlotte have better wine options for about half the price per glass. Besides that, my food came out completely wrong and instead of having a manager apologize, I waited 15 minutes while my date sat anxiously waiting to eat the food placed in front of him. Needless to say, by the time my food came out, his was cold. Both of our dishes were EXTREMELY salty. Horrendous to be exact. I could barely stomach my food but was so hungry, I forced it down. The pasta was flavorless and seemed to have just been tossed in oil. The chicken tasted of nothing other than salt. I would hate to see how many grams of sodium were actually in that dish. It was unbearable. It was sad that a manager never came by to apologize for the terrible evening we had or the fact that our food was wrong. Our server also didn't seem to be alarmed by the fact that neither of us had silverware until she noticed us both looking around confused. Check was well over 100 dollars, the food was worth maybe 5 at best. Will not recommend this restaurant or be returning.",

Best part of today's lunch was service - Anthony, originally from Astoria Queens NYC, has been here for 8 months, sounded exactly like he should sound with the NY accent, serving in an Italian restaurant!  He was helpful, attentive, interactive and one of the best servers I've had in this city.  He also brought a sample of the soup of the day to the table for tasting prior to ordering.  Very attentive service - bravo, Anthony!  Food?  Very mixed reviews.  The tilapia special was thoroughly enjoyed by both diners at our table who ordered it.  Note to kitchen - the portion sizes on the two plates was noticably different (although the smaller portion did happen to go to the lighter eater so it wasn't a problem).  If the same dish is going to two people at the same table, they plates should look alike!  I started with the minestrone soup (a menu staple) and while the flavor was good, it was tepid when served.  Made me sad.  My meatball sandwich was also a bit lukewarm and heavy on the salt.  It just didn't taste as fresh as I wanted.  This lunch was a birthday celebration so the lemon cookies with two dramatic candles was a very nice end to the meal.  And the cookies were great - not too sweet, enough lemon flavor without being bitter and enough to share around the table.  Note on the door says that as of Feb 1, this will be a smoke free establishment.",

    "text": "We had our rehearsal dinner at Maggiano's in Richmond a year ago, so I was excited to see if the Maggiano's here was just as good.  It was.  We came here while we were house-hunting last winter, and not only had a great meal with a bottle of wine, but also got some great neighborhood tips from the table next to us (the official moment I started loving Charlotte).  I don't remember what we got, so I'll focus on a more recent visit.  Actually, 2 recent visits.  My job had a speaker come, and they rented the upstairs room and had appetizers and wine.  I haven't had a wine here I haven't liked (and there are several out there), and the appetizers were all good.  Following the presentation, we went downstairs and split a Ravioli and each had another glass of wine.  The ravioli were very good--and it was plenty of food to split.  If you have similar taste as your dining companion, there are a lot of dishes you could split, but I also look forward to the leftovers the next day.  The portions are generous.  Some of the dishes get a little salty, but otherwise, they are seasoned well.  It is definitely a straight-up Italian restaurant.  Some of my go-tos are Lasagne, Chicken Pesto Linguine, and the Eggplant Parm.  Oh, and the Manicotti is delicious as well.   Dinner can run you around $50 a person with drinks, but I found the atmosphere to be nice for dinner.  I also appreciate that I never feel rushed by the staff, even when they are busy.",

We wanted to have them take it back and keep it warm but she moved plates over and dropped the pasta and left.  So, until they start adding some flavor to the sauces, this is not even an average Italian restaurant.",

She was right about the appetizers though. . . I loved them but that's about it. I tried the fried zucchini, stuffed mushrooms, and tomato & mozzarella -- ALL were GREAT. I ordered the garlic shrimp with linguine in spciy lobster sauce. I substituted the linguine for whole wheat penne (only choice of whole wheat). The portion was huge but the taste was disappointing. The shrimp was a good in size and the spicy lobster sauce was spicy but too sweet to go with the shrimp and whole wheat pasta. I did not taste the garlic. What a shame!!! I had enough left for two meals, which I think I will recook adding some spinach or other vegetables to reduce the sweetness.   The price was worth the portion but not the taste.",

They assured us of the care they took in preparing the meal as to not contaminate my wife food. But the very first thing she ate, she got sick from. We finished our meal, which the others all loved and headed home. My wife's stomach was swollen by the time we got to Belk. we arrived home she was in agony and that went on all night.

It took so long in fact that we decided to tell our waitress, Sarah, to just box it up to go.  We ordered the buy one and take a second complimentary meal home. I went with Eggplant Parmesan for both entrees.  I was going to change it up a bit and order the vegetable primavera alfredo, but decided against it at the last moment.. because I love eggplant parm and spaghetti.. can't go wrong with that dish.  The food was delicious.  The only thing I was surprised that the meal(s) didn't come with a salad.  Olive Garden has a similar deal, but their first meal comes with a large fresh, tasty salad and breadsticks.  We did eat bread and olive oil while waiting. It took probably 45 minutes for our food and checks to finally come out.",

The \"Linguini Di Mare\" is quite possibly the best seafood pasta dish that I have ever eaten.  My wife \"Rigatoni Di\" was excellent as well.  Maggiano's always has some of the best wine sauces.   I'm speechless.  It takes a lot to impress me, and I can only think of the positive and wonderful experience that my wife and I experienced.f  One more thing,  I almost forgot about the desert.  The \"Desert Sampler\" pushed us over the edge as we drifted into a food coma.  Coffee is needed to make the drive home.  Sorry the picture isn't better, but we had a hard time waiting.",

There are a few meeting spaces upstairs at this restaurant and then another one hidden behind the downstairs bar and who knows where else.  So this review is for the family style lunch during the conference.    The food was wonderful with 3 courses of food to share at each table.  For appetizers, there was bruschetta, fried zucchini, caesar salad and something else I am probably missing.  For entrees, there was chicken parm, a vegetable rigatoni and a spicy ziti dish.  And for dessert there was  NY style cheesecake and an baked apple dessert.    The desserts ruled!!  There was plenty of food to go around.  Service was wonderful and I ate so much that I could have rolled back to work.  Honestly, there should be a law that all lunch meetings be held at Maggiano's!",

Freshly prepared and expertly served, we were very pleased.   My wife had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and it was awesome. I went with the veal parmigiana and it too was excellent. We aren't wine drinkers but we did end up with room for dessert and the apple crostada with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel was also outstanding. The only miss of the whole evening was that my wife's water glass was allowed to run dry but that was the only error that the server made.  All in all, another great meal and part of a really fun two nights in Charlotte on our way to Playa del Carmen, Mexico!",

We ordered the calamari, which was lightly breaded and delicious. I would highly recommend.  We also ordered from their classic pastas menu so for a little over 12 dollars I had an eggplant parmesan in restaurant and a baked ziti to take home for later. I enjoyed the eggplant but it was a little more breading than I cared for. The eggplant slices were thin and while some people might like that, I prefer less breading and more eggplant. Still, it was tasty.  All in all, I'd come back to try some of their other menu items.",

    "text": "While not usually a fan of Italian food, I've been in the mood lately, and Maggiano's hit the spot.  The portion sizes are ridiculously amazing, and for that alone, I give it 4 stars.    The ZUCCHINI FRITTE consisted of long, fairly thin slices of zucchini, breaded in panko, fried and served with a lemon aioli.  Although I personally thought it needed a little salt, the overall execution was great.  Very crispy zucchini and the aoili was just the right dipping sauce.  I even enjoyed the provided lemon wedge, which I squeezed over the dish.    However, I would not have ordered an appetizer had I known how enormous the entree portions are.  Sister ordered the CHICKEN FLORENTINE, which came with 2 thick chicken breasts, breaded and pan-fried, and stuffed with spinach and cheese or some sort of cream sauce.  It was served with a side of angel hair pasta and alfredo/cream sauce.  Overall way too much to eat in one serving, but she found it delicious and was happy to have the leftovers.  The chicken appeared to be well executed and not at all dry.  The FOUR CHEESE RAVIOLI was stuffed with ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and cream cheese.  Despite sounding nice, it was bland.  I didn't specifically ask if the pasta was made in-house, but the awnings outside say \"homemade pasta.\"   After tasting this ravioli, I'm fairly certain it's not fresh or made in-house.  The saving grace for this dish was the pesto alfredo sauce.  Alfredo can often be one-note and boring, but the addition of the pesto made this flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I really wanted a spoon to eat it like soup.  As nice as the pesto alfredo is, it's so rich that it could be cloying if it weren't for the small pour of red sauce over the top.  The red sauce added a sweetness and acidity needed to balance out the creamy richness of the alfredo.    The best part of the meal occured when I ordered my pasta and the server asked which SECONDARY PASTA I WANTED TO TAKE HOME WITH ME.  What?  I was seriously confused.  So for $14, I got 2 full-sized pasta meals.  Amazing.  For that, I will be back.",

    "text": "We had numerous small issues and a couple of major ones that ended up making us not want to come back, all related to service. Small stuff-forgetting kids drinks (had to ask a food runner about them), ignoring requests for ice, only one drink refill in a 2 hour period, one of the entrees was pretty bland, time between salad and entrees was very long, even for a Saturday-our kids ate their entire meal while we waited on our entrees. Major stuff-absent server, our \"take home\" food came out when our entrees finally did-and sat in the heat on the patio for over 45 minutes while we ate, and waited...waited...waited on our server (FOOD SAFETY ISSUE). When he came to take the food to pack up to take home he stacked dirty silverware on top of leftover food (from a different plate) that was supposed to be packed up, and dumped one plate of leftovers onto another plate. That was disgusting. He finally came back to ask if we wanted dessert (we had 2 kids wanting their ice cream and both parties at the table got the Marco's meal-um, yeah, we wanted dessert). He gave us the menu and didn't come back for another 10 minutes, by then I told him we did not even want dessert. After waiting for the check for another 10 minutes with server nowhere in sight we finally got fed up and asked for the manager. Politely explained the issues, and also told him we would NOT be taking that food home that had sat in the heat for so long. He said he would \"take a look at the check and see what I can do\". Then we waited some more. When the server came to pick up the check, we told him we were waiting on the manager before paying and he tossed the check down on the table and said \"sure\" sarcastically, turned and walked away. At that point I was DONE, and I left my husband to deal with the check and the rudeness, taking our kids out to walk the mall. My husband stated that the manager never came back but the server did, demanding to know what was wrong, etc. and telling us all the to-go food was frozen and should have been fine (it has not been frozen when we previously visited, nor had any other table gotten their to go food prior to when they were clearing entrees and getting their checks. When the \"adjusted\" bill came in, the manager had taken a whole $8 off our check and $5 off my parents check. We feel that not only was the service TERRIBLE at a restaurant that charges $20 per plate, and that the manager totally blew us off-not ever coming back to the table and leaving us to deal with the server. Our previous visits had been fine, but now I have no desire to return to Maggiano's anytime in the near future.",

The missteps were to numerous to fully chronicle.i have never posted an opinion regarding a dining experience ,until now,but this level of incompetence warrants forewarning to future patrons of this establishment. As stated we were promptly seated at prescribed time and the waitress came over to greet us 30 minutes later at which time our water glasses were filled and bread was placed on the table with no accompaniments ,another 20 minutes past and now 50 minutes since seating we were permitted to place our drink & appetizer order at which time 3 appetizer orders were place & we requested the  accompaniments for the bread another 20 minutes passes and 2 of the three appetizers arrive.10 minutes later the drinks arrive with the waitress holding the drink tray and request if we could move or plates so she could set the tray down .We complied requested the status of the appetizer and asked for the accompaniments for the bread which consist of black pepper/Parmesan cheese & oil.She was able to obtain these items from the  table behind us that left 30 minutes earlier that had yet to be attended to.It should also be noted that she failed to take away the serving tray which was left in front me while she went over to get the next of patrons that were seated beside our party I handed the tray back  and requested a second round of drinks as we had hit two hour mark in this epic ordeal.It should also be noted that the entree order was placed at the time of the initial appetizer placement and we informed the waitress that one of the member of our dining party was a vegetarian 20 minutes later the missing appetizer is located It's arrival was the only notice we received .drinks shortly followed with the meals of the eights meals requested,the vegetarian meal had the optional chicken added to fettuccine Alfredo (sent back) ,my son chicken meal was burned(also sent back my meal was the basic meatball which were ice cold. Of the 8 meals three were to satisfaction and consumed 3 were left on table uneaten and the 2 returns meals were wrapped to go as we requested the check just to end this ordeal. Total time wasted at this establishment was 3 hours with five of Eight of us leaving the establishment looking for someplace to eat.i wish I could find a something positive to say about the evening and my dining experience",

    "text": "We went here for brunch recently for a special occasion.  My mother selected it and I feel bad for her because it was such a disappointing meal.  It started when they said they didn't have our reservation. Luckily they accommodated us. It was 10:30 AM and they gave us one brunch menu and several dinner menus.  When one of us went back to the hostess and asked for brunch menu, they seemed put out. We had 2 kids with us.  When we asked the waiter about options for them, he said they had brunch menus for kids but he didn't know where they were. Luckily their tastes are pretty simple, so were able to get them plain waffles. The service was slow and underwhelming.  We didn't get any refills on water or coffee.  The food was also disappointing.  The french toast was burnt, but so cold that the butter didn't melt. The syrup was fake (ie Aunt Jemima). The italian sausage frittata was bland and tasted like it was microwaved.  The vesuvio potatoes were dried out. The orange juice was out of a carton.  All in all, it was very disappointing and I wouldn't reccomend it. I know i would not go back.",

Prices are surprisingly affordable for such an an affluent area of South Charlotte. They are famous for their huge serving sizes and reliable service. Great, casual atmosphere.  It has proven impossible for us not to order to Marco's Meal for Two for $42.95. It's a super deal and includes two salads, four pasta dishes and a desert. It always provides enough food for two to three meals.  All of their salads are special and plentiful. We went with the Maggiano's and the Chopped this time (but have tried them all.) Both, as usual, were excellent - fresh lettuce and bacon with flavorful dressings. Fresh baked bread is included and don't be shy in asking for a fresh loaf to take home with your leftovers (which you'll surely have.)  Our four pasta dishes included the Baked Ziti, Eggplant Parmesean, Four Cheese Ravioli and Lasagna. Everything was good but the ravioli was the star! Perfect texture and savory sauce.  Finished off with the tiramisu but have, again, tried them all. There are no duds here. Most run $7.95 regular price and are enough for two. We added a cappuccino for a reasonable $3.95 and waddled to the car with a smile.  This place is a Gotta Try!",

If you are looking for a really good bowl of spaghetti with marinara and a meat ball theirs is definitely my favorite.  My only complaint about the food is about the salads, I really prefer romaine to iceberg, so I don't love their salads but that may just be a personal preference. I've also tried many of their desserts all of which have been delicious. The creme brulee is my favorite.",

    "text": "I was here a couple of weeks ago for dinner with my husband and my mother who was in from out of town. We shop at the South Park Mall frequently, but we had never been to Maggiano's before and decided to give it a try. We had 6:00pm reservations on a Wednesday for our party of three, but my mom's plane was late arriving at the Charlotte airport, so I called the restaurant and changed the time with no problem whatsoever. They were polite and accommodating.   Parking was a bit odd. There was a large, roped off section of the parking lot for valet restaurant parking... not a single car was parked there, but this area took up most of the close, available parking, and we ended up having to park the the garage. I didn't see anyone from the restaurant available to valet park us had we been lazy enough to consider this option, so overall it was just a waste of parking space. Maybe on Friday/Saturday nights it makes more sense, I don't know.   The restaurant was only about one-third filled downstairs, but for some reason we were seated at a small, rectangular table for four that was right next to what was obviously going to be a large party of 20-ish  that hadn't shown up yet. Our table was sort of crammed up next to this long table for the yet-to-arrive party, but we sat where we were directed mostly because my mom sat down before I could complain.  Our waiter was very nice, though he did mix up my wine selection with my mom's, and riesling makes me want to vomit. We switched glasses, and I survived.  The menu offered a wide variety of choices, and I settled for the special which was touted as some \"contest-winning\" lasagna with chicken and artichokes, etc. I forget what it was called. My mom had the eggplant parmesan. My husband had a steak of some sort. He liked the steak, my mom said the eggplant was \"mushy,\" and my lasagna was luke-warm and not all that flavorful. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. And it was kind of expensive for just \"okay.\"  Now on a weird note, my mom's meal qualified for a free entree to take-home. Never heard of such a thing before. She selected their lasagna (not the special that I had, but just a basic lasagna in a tomato sauce... my housekeeper said it was good when he heated it up the next day for lunch).   About 2/3rd's of the way through our dinner, that party of 20-ish we were dreading showed up. We actually had to move our tiny table backwards so we had any room what-so-ever to maneuver once they were seated. It was a birthday party of some sort, and they were LOUD. I was happy our dinner was coming to an end at that point.  I probably won't eat here again. There are too many other restaurant options available in/around the mall.",

He insisted that every dish was bottomless.   We did the Classic Family Dinner:  3 Appetizers:    - Spinach & Artichoke al Forno - Very rich, creamy, and flavorful    - Sausage & Peppers - Delicious, but why is this an appetizer??      - Bruschetta - Great flavor, but eat it fast or the lovely buttery bread gets soggy and ruins the fun. *BONUS App compliments of the chef for being a new customer?*    - Crispy Zucchini Fritte -  How on earth did they make it so breaded and crispy?  I make fried zucchini all the time and it never turns out this good...  4 Main Courses:     - Beef Tenderloin Medallions - FANTASTIC!  It was served on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and topped with crispy thin onion rings. YUM!    - Chicken Parmesan - Nice and crispy.  Just your basic Chicken Parm!    - Chicken Tortelloni - Eh, not great.  Maybe it was the intense flavors of all the other foods that made this taste so bland, but It wasn't our favorite.    - Spaghetti & Meatballs - There is actually only one giant meatball.  That \"s\" at the end is misleading!  Tasted good, not the best spaghetti I've had, but did its spaghetti duties.  2 Desserts:     - Strawberry Pie (Special of the day) - I thought I had no room left, but I still scarfed this down.  Light and perfectly sweet.    - Apple Crostada - AMAZING.  So crispy and delicious.  Warm under a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Heavenly.  I'm pretty sure I need to say some prayers and ask forgiveness for my gluttony.  I blame our server.  He kept sneaking more food on our table to \"give us our money's worth\".    I think I need another nap.",

We had to keep asking for our drinks to be refilled. After about 45 minutes after placing our order she informs us that the chef lost our order because the printer stopped working. After another 30 minutes our entrees arrived but was disappointed in them. My wife was told the vegetable primivara had a white sauce but ther no sauce at all on it. The other entries looked and tasted like they were thrown in a microwave and warmed up. There were larger parties seated around us 30 minutes after we were and had already eaten and left. The manager came to our table after the waitress had seen my wife was eating her entree. We told him our grievances and he ask what could they do. I said how about desserts for everyone and after another 30 minutes, they were brought to table. He also said he would take care of everything, but was not sure what he was talking about, so we assumed that our meal was going to be comped but that was not the case. Our bills came to table mixed up. Only bight side was our 72 dollar bill was reduced to 26 and changed. Also looking at the decor in the restaurant, and noticed how many light bulbs in the lights were burned out and how DIRTY they areas around the air vents were. Hate to think that dirty air was falling onto customers plates. Was looking for a wonder evening with friends but was badly disappointed. Will not be back and will steer others away from  Maggianos. We arrived at 7:13 and did not leave till 10:30.",

The bread paired with olive oil was really, really good. I ordered the beef medallions, and they were delicious. Cooked how I wanted them, soft, and the sauce was pretty good, too. It came with very good mashed potatoes and onion rings (very thin) and portobello mushrooms, which were all right. I tried some of the shrimp scampi, and that was exceptional as well. They even came by to drop of lemon cookies with candles in them for my mom--nice touch. Service was very good, really nothing to complain about here. I would definitely return.",

However, we were a party of 6 and made reservations two weeks in advance, I do not understand why we were given one of the worst tables in the restaurant.  We were put in the corner table by the elevator.  There was a constant stream of servers, patrons, busboys and trash collectors going up the elevator.  Not to mention the rescue workers that took a woman out on a stretcher.  My son and his girlfriend had to move for that.   Because we were in the corner we were forgotten about by some of the support staff.  Our salads came out before the appetizer.   It took forever to get our teas refilled, and we had to ask for utensils and plates several times. It was a good experience but not great.  I noticed that there were tables for 6 in the extra room where the patrons were not crammed together like sardines and not constantly interrupted by the goings on of the elevator.",

    "text": "OK... it's a chain so some folks will knock off points just BECAUSE! However, it is hard to knock excellent service, delicious food, accommodating special requests, and BOGO classic pastas! So YES... five stars. Now for the details... party of four...  we had a reservation & were seated promptly on a Friday evening at 6:30PM. Our waitress Patricia brought menus, took drink orders, soon brought drinks & complimentary bread, poured olive oil onto plates for each of the four of us in our party (celebrating a birthday but did not inform her of that). She asked if we had any questions about the menu & prepared to take our orders.   I had looked online and thought I wanted the four cheese ravioli... BUT the menu said it came with a pesto sauce. NOT MY PREFERENCE so I asked about a substitution... meat sauce instead. NO PROBLEM, said Patricia (& same price). Oh & add a side of meatballs... when brought out with my meal, there were 2 the size of tennis balls: tender & tasty in a small bowl with marinara.  Other orders were eggplant parmesan w spaghetti & marinara, baked ziti with sausage & pomodoro sauce, and seared scallops special with pasta and sauce. The \"house\" Pinot Noir was particularly good, too.  Lest anyone think that (good) plain olive oil poured onto a plate is bland, be imaginative! Add fresh ground black pepper from the peppermill on the table... and grated parm, also on the table. If you need more kick, ask for some crushed red pepper flakes! MMMM, so good with the complimentary dense bread with refills as needed.  Toward the end of the meal, Patricia returned and informed three of us who had ordered classic pasta dishes that THEY ARE A DEAL that includes ANOTHER OF EQUAL or LESSER VALUE to take home for another day! Only the seared scallop special did not qualify for the BOGO deal.  Dessert... Maggiano's Tiramisu really is \"to die for\" good! And the coffee is also quite good. The ONLY thing that was not excellent this visit was the Creme Brulee which was not as creamy & light as offerings at other places we've been. I would recommend another choice... LIKE the Tiramisu which even LOOKS as special as it tastes!  As we left, one in the party wondered WHY we did not come to Maggiano's more often? Perhaps it is because someone else chose Maggiano's this night because the birthday person chooses... but usually defers to THAT one's choices when this foursome goes out! lol  Valet parking is available... offered by the mall at curbside outside Maggiano's... reasonable and very convenient.  ALSO Maggiano's offers FAMILY STYLE MEALS as a dining option. This can be great fun... we went to a family 50th anniversary party (a few years ago) at Maggiano's for about 40 people. We were served family style which provided an opportunity to try new menu items that might not have been chosen otherwise due to \"playing it safe\" when ordering.  It will not be years before we go back to Maggiano's... my wife said we should go back again soon. Just us... or with a couple/group. As someone else remarked... consistency is a good thing when it means consistently good service and consistently good food! Maggiano's IS consistent!  Maggiano's blends casual dining, excellent food/service, & white table cloths into an enjoyable dining experience for all ages. While there I also saw several plates that looked very appetizing: lasagna (next time) unless I order that HUGE SERVING of clams I saw being enjoyed at a nearby table.",

I wold have to say my favorite dish in the chicken and spinach manicotti, it is so heavy, filling, creamy and cheesy! By far, the best on the menu. Cute for a date night, wedding party or baby shower since they have banquet rooms you can rent out, even for a reception. Staff is always nice and friendly, the atmosphere is lovely.",

The meal, on the other hand, was terrible. I got a simple dish of quinoa pasta with a spicy sauce, spinach and allegedly some Swiss chard. Poorly plated, really just plopped  into the bowl. Sauce splattered the sides of the bowl to make it very unappealing, like someone had been eating the dish prior to it being torn away and delivered to me. Rather than spicy, the flavor was dominated, overpowered by salt. The pasta was done well, the veggies added were there, I guess. Couldn't really tell because of the salt. I had them hold the chicken, so I can't comment on an item which is normally included in the dish. There was maybe two cups, at most, to the dish. $20 for the quality and quantity is a joke, also.",

The food that he suggested was awesome (huge portion sizes) and the wine he suggested to go with our entrees was perfect.

    "text": "Notice the four stars, but this started out as a bad experience that was made good:  a sign of an excellent establishment with management that is on top of things and is dedicated to making things right.  We went for lunch.  It was uncrowded, not more than 8 tables of people.  In fact, there were excess staff hovering about and the wait staff maybe had 2 tables each at any one time.  A very quiet lunch period.  There is a special lunch menu and we both ordered to the skirt steak with fries and side salad, along with a side of sauteed spinach.  Simple, eh?  Well, we waited and waited.  Joseph, our server told us twice that our order was coming.  Meanwhile we overheard two other servers apologizing to their table for the delay and then Joseph came by to apologize.  I commented, lightly, \"Well I guess the kitchen is overwhelmed by the crowd today?\"  After 40 minutes we received our order along with more apologies, but it was Anessa the manager delivering our order.  Very nice lady and she was very generous in comping some of our order so it turned out fine.  The servers did nothing wrong and it was only the kitchen, so if this happens to you, bring in the big guns by asking for the manager.  Maggiano's selects, trains and retains some of the best managers around and those managers, along with the business itself has a very low tolerance for screw-ups.  They, even more so than you, want things to be perfect.  As usual, food was excellent, portions just shy of gigantic, clean facility and sincere servers.  If you have not had a Maggiano's experience...get in there.  You will not regret it.",

I was pretty disappointed with this dining experience, it started off with the caprese as an app which was actually pretty good! My mom ordered the light fettuccini as her entree which she said was \"meh okay.\" I was craving me some penne a la vodka and the menu said we could make special orders so I thought a simple dish like that would be okay. The waiter gave me the options of whole wheat penne or gluten free, and I went with the whole wheat. My penne came out not cooked all the way and with little vodka sauce. I REALLY hate to be that person but I just couldn't eat it. The waiter made the comment that I probably didn't like it because \"whole wheat pasta is healthy\" and then the experience went downhill from there. He brought me the fettuccini which I felt was a bit bland. I was sad because I have had only very positive experiences in the past but the food this time wasn't very good and the waiter was a bit condescending throughout our experience.",

I was told that the restaurant was limiting the amount of ppl per reservation to 7 ppl max. In my shock I asked \"well what times do you have?\" The girl on the phone said we are pretty open from 6:30 on... So does this make sense? - you're not booked but you're limiting groups to no more than 7.   Essentially turning customers away.    I recently relocated here to Charlotte from NYC I have been to Maggiano's several times AND LOVED IT and even celebrated my birthday there this past July.   I was devastated and quite embarrassed to have to tell my friends that I was not able to get a table to accommodate us.   So sad Maggiano's There was no flexibility .  Turning away customers & you're not even booked.",

    "text": "I love this place. I'm always happy when I leave, however I am disappointed that they have literally changed every single item that I eat when I come. The filet used to be served in a sort of au jus sauce that is now very similar but almost like its tomato based now, still delicious but I miss the old way they also used to do it also with crispy onion strings on top that were always fresh and tasted so good with the sauce combined but now they are served with the same basic potato wedges you see everywhere. The mashed potatoes don't taste homemade anymore.... Still very good though. The salad was the thing that made me the most sad it used to be made with spinach huge chunks of Gorgonzola, pine nuts onions and vinaigrette. Now it's vinaigrette tiny balls of bleu cheese onions and tiny flakes of prosciutto. The dressing is different but it was amazing so kudos on that. The asparagus is also different it's simply grilled now when it use to be in a lemon tasting sauce. I miss these items so so much but everything they changed it to is still wonderful as well. I will definitely return however now that my favorites are gone I'll be sampling some new menu items.  DO NOT skip dessert the creme brulee and tiramisu is to die for and worth saving room for.   Service is always amazing there's valet parking available and of course lots of after dinner shopping available in South Park mall which it's attached to.",

    "text": "Maggiano's failed horribly today! I flew back home to celebrate my birthday with my wife, who was very excited because I finally gave in to trying her favorite restaurant, Maggiano's. The problems started immediately. We were told that there is a 15 minute wait, which is expected because it is restaurant week. We waited 33 minutes exactly to be seated and that was after I went inside to check on why we had not been seated yet. Once we were seated, the server took about 6 minutes to greet us. My wife informed him that it was my birthday and to bring me an Old Fashion made with Woodford Reserve with a splash of St. Germaine. When I did finally get my drink, it was watered down and there was NO St. Germaine at all. Our calamari came out cold, but I was starving so we ate it. The server took forever to check on us, so we simply told him of the problem in hopes he would step his service up. My wife's filet and risotto came out GREAT! BUT, AND THIS IS A HUGE BUT, my gnocchi and Italian sausage was lukewarm at best. I wanted to complain, but the server again took forever to come back and check on us so I ate it. When he did finally ask how the meal was, I told him that I wish my food had been hotter and I was not impressed with the food nor the service this far. He simply apologized and collected the dishes, not once offering anything more than desert. We paid and left, unsatisfied and disappointed. I have worked in the restaurant industry before and I have worked Restaurant Week in Charlotte. This experience makes me feel like he didn't even care about us as guest. My birthday dinner was horrible. My wife still tipped him 25% because we know how it is to work for tips. That should be all the more motivating to him as a server to bring his \"A\" game to each table. This was disappointing to me, but more for my wife because she promised me an experience I would never forget. Maggiano's is her favorite restaurants in Charlotte and then to have it fail on my birthday, made her upset because it did not live up to the hype she put behind it. I will probably never go back to this establishment again, but I do hope that they read this and make adjustments with the serving staff. This was not to focus on a particular server, so that is why I did not name said server in this review. If you do decide to eat here, go when there are no big events going on. Maybe then you can get the service and experience that was promised to me, but fell so drastically short of.",

    "text": "As a guest to my Grandmas 90th birthday party at Maggiano's I thought this place was fantastic! We had a room set up upstairs, which was decorated before we got there and they had tables set up. Not much room for dancing, but we didn't really dance that much... :).   When we arrived we were able to valet our car, something we have never done before and we felt like celebrities.   The package that was purchased was appetizers, a full open bar, and a buffet dinner, as well as dessert for a party of around 50-60 people.   The appetizers were my favorite part of the food portion, with yummy fried mozzarella, stuffed mushrooms, and bread. I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but all of the waitstaff was very accommodating.   The bar was a little stingy on the alcohol in my opinion, but hey, maybe I like strong drinks.   For dinner we had salad, salmon, many pastas, meatballs, and several other things I'm sure I never even saw.  There was also a champagne toast, which the waiters and waitresses brought around glasses of champagne to everyone. A great touch.   They have a sound system available, but you have to bring in your own music. An iPod worked fine for us.     Desserts were a vast array of anything you could think of and was delicious.   Great way to spend any birthday party, this one will go down in the record books.",

Despite the hecticness of several parties going on at once causing a slight delay with courses, management was phenomenal with communication and kept us in the loop.  The room was intimate enough to allow for easy conversations. Food was good except not sure the Parmesan crusted tilapia actually had Parmesan on it. Family style allowed for enough options that there was something for everyone.  Appetizers, entrees, and dessert were the three courses. Again our wait staff made the entire experience pleasurable despite the delay with food.  It was nice that the room was already decorated. Beautiful experience.",

The Braised beef hash and eggs came out without an eggs... whoops! The second time the plate came out it was made with scrambled eggs when in actuality the dish was ordered with over-easy eggs. Don't get me wrong though- it was a very delicious meal!!  Overall it was a nice little place to gran a drink and a meal before or after shopping but we wouldn't go out of our way to return here.",

I asked for the house dressing and Caesar dressing to be added in the meal just to be sure.  I was delighted with the service after having everything bagged including butter, cheese, and oils (no herb!) because I want the full experience as if dining in.  I left a small tip but then to get home and find out only one salad dressing was there which was Caesar.  It wasn't what we had at work but it was tasty enough.  I realized the house dressing was the dressing we had at work.  As for my main meal of spaghetti and meatballs was sort of a bore with barely any marinara sauce in the meal.  I never order basic pasta but I was impress by the catering although it was self-serve.",

It appeared to be an upscale restaurant with a good selection of fare.  Oh, how deceiving looks can be.  We had an office party here in a private room.  Our entree choices were filet mignon, salmon, and chicken.  I chose the filet and requested that it be done medium rare.  The server informed me that was not possible since all of the steaks were already precooked to medium.  Precooked?  When I questioned him on this, he just shrugged.  I'm a former chef and I can tell you that you do not, under any circumstances, pre cook steaks like that.  After waiting about thirty minutes, they finally served the appetizers, which were fair at best.  The calamari was chewy and the bruschetta was rock hard.  We were starving, but still left lots of calamari and bruschetta, since they were barely edible.  About twenty minutes later came the Caesar salad, which was OK.  It was about another twenty minutes after that before the entrees were served.  The filet appeared to have started out as a good piece of beef, but was dry as dust by the time it got to us.  You had to drown it in steak sauce in order to get it down.  The same with the salmon.  Maggiano's serves \"family style\", which means that the sides are served in large bowls to be passed around the table.  It was another ten or fifteen minutes before they arrived, mostly by the time people finished their entree.  They were just ok, and eminently forgettable.  Finally, dessert arrived: mini cheese cakes and lemon cookies.  I must admit that the lemon cookies were the highlight of the evening.  To sum up:  the food was mediocre at best, the service and pacing of the meal was incredibly slow, and the overall experience was horrible.  Frankly, if you are incapable of handling a party, you should refer them to a decent restaurant that can pull it off.  I wouldn't go back here if the meal were free.  A total waste of time and money.",

    "text": "Okay I feel like my review will not be much different from the rest but after visiting this restaurant for the second time yesterday I figured I'd give a review.   Bottom line is, this place needs new front end staff, a new reservation system, and to learn some manners. When I went to go put my name down, I was told it was a 2 hour wait, which okay, I get it's a Friday night at 7 but I was shocked that it was still 2 hours for 2 people. I'm guessing the one of the other front end girls was as shocked as me and stepped in to tell me it would be about an hour, not 2 so I was okay and took the buzzer.   One huge issue is, Maggiano's is attached to South Park mall so it seems perfect to walk around the mall for an hour while you wait, but of course the buzzer deactivates if you enter the mall. Great. After waiting about an hour and 15, I went to ask the staff how much longer, and I was told I was put on the wrong waiting list (the 2 hour one) and I would be called in 15 minutes. Obviously I'm frustrated at this point and obviously I got called 30 minutes later. Ate, and then waited another 10 minutes for the dessert which our waitress forgot all about. All in all, the food is ok, one step above Olive Garden, but the deal they have with getting two entrees to go is pretty good.   If you're looking for decent Italian, a super nice environment, and won't totally break the bank, I'd recommend (but only if you go on a weekday at like 3 pm or else you're waiting forever :-)",

The spinach artichoke dip was honestly the best part of my meal. The eggplant lasagna was exceptionally delicious.

    "text": "IMHO this is decent enough Italian for a chain restaurant. However, if you have a reservation, I would advise  you to call ahead to see if they are behind on reservations and/or have a back up plan.  I made a reservation for two for 8 pm on a Friday night. When we arrived, the hostess informed me they were 15 minutes behind on reservations. By 8:30 pm, we still hadn't been seated, we asked for an update and she said we should be seated shortly. By 8:40 we had had enough. I booked on Open Table but they wouldn't allow me to schedule another reservation- I guess if the restaurant doesn't put you in the system as seated you can't make another reservation within 2 hours of the 1st. I did notice however, that Maggiano's was listing an 8:45 reservation available for a party of two. How would they seat that party if they were already running 40 minutes behind on the 8 pm reservations?  So I CALLED a nearby restaurant, asked about availability, they stated they had tables open, notified the hostess at Maggiano's  that we were cancelling and we left.  IMHO.the food is okay but it is NOT  worth waiting over 40 minutes for, especially when you have a reservation- I am not sure ANY  restaurant is worth waiting 40 minutes for. I don't know how they manage their reservations system but it seemed that they overbooked and should not have continued to accept reservations.",

I honestly don't see the hype!!!  I am not a fan.  I was forced against my will to dine at Maggianos and it was only my 3rd time going here and it will hopefully be my last.    I mean, I don't know how else to say it:  It just isn't that good!  I am not a fan of big chains in the first place and I've already stated that I am an Italian food snob so I understand that my opinion my mean nothing but so what...  Here was my experience in a nutshell:  Reservations, 1:00, rude hostess, finally sat around 1:30. Bread on tables?  Bleh, not fresh, not good. The food..I ordered Eggplant Parm, which came with a side of pasta/marinara sauce.  Puke and pukity.  Soggy breaded eggplant wich I couldn't even tell there was eggplant hidden in the mush and super salty marinara sauce that tasted like Preggo.  I will say that those who ordered Chicken Francaise were extremely impressed.  Those of us that ordered pasta dishes, not so much.    The service-Just okay...had to ask for refills on water a few times and we all sat patiently waiting to order the desserts we picked out well before dinner all to have our checks brought with no option to order dessert!  LOL...I guess they wanted us OUT!  I don't blame them.  We were annoying.  There was like 13 of us after a baby dedication so we were taking pictures, passing around a baby, laughing too loud, etc.    On ANOTHER note, I found it interesting that at the end of your meal they bring you a another free meal if you ordered one of their signature pastas.  I am sure the average person would be screaming \"score!!!\" but the foodie/skeptic in me was screaming \"wth?\"  Like, what?  Are you cleaning out your fridge and want to give me all the leftovers or did you cook too much lasagna so you are sending me home with some?  I don't get it.  Normally I would take free food but if the quality was where it should be and it was fresh/homemade, etc.. Sorry to burst any bubbles but you wouldn't be getting a free meal.  Just my opinion.  There are way better Italian restaurants out there and even better chains.  I think Carrabas is a better Italian chain.",

I've been here before for special events, but today was nice being on a whim. We say upstairs overlooking the dining area! The staff was extremely helpful and kind with our table. We ordered Marco's Meal for Two which included either 2 side salads of our choice or an appetizer, 2 pasta entrees and dessert. It also included a \"take home\" pastas for each of us! We chose 2 side salads, the Italian tossed salad and Chopped salad. The Italian tossed salad had a creamy Italian dressing, lettuce, tomatoes, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini peppers, onions and Parmesan cheese. Delightful! The Chopped salad had prosciutto, tomatoes, avocado and blue cheese with house dressing. For entrees, we chose Mom's Lasagna which had layers of pasta, cheese and meat sauce. It was filling and comforting just like from home! I chose the Eggplant Parmesan which was layers of breaded eggplant, marinara sauce and pasta. It was fresh, perfectly cooked and absolutely the best eggplant I've had in years! For dessert my husband chose the Creme Brulee and loved it. I added an extra dessert because I wanted Tiramisu. It was huge, but the espresso-soaked ladyfingers were perfectly layered in the mascarpone cheese filling and topped with cocoa powder and dark chocolate pieces! I was stuffed but ate it all! My husband chose the lasagna to bring home and I chose the 4 Cheese ravioli. I can't wait to go back!",

The pasta was extremely dry, barely having any cream sauce at all and lacking in seasoning and flavors. Very tough to eat.

However, when given the opportunity to enjoy a free lunch with my office I will close my mouth around some free food. I was pleasantly surprised. The service was impeccable. Gracious, without checking in too often.  I'm not sure how long the buy one famous pasta entree get another one free (FREE!) pasta deal will last but I've heard that its been around for awhile. You can enjoy lasagna for lunch and take home ravioli, or eggplant parm or spaghetti or any other pasta of your choosing. They don't even make you feel cheap for ordering a BOGO special (like everyone at my table did). Our waiter even brought us complimentary delicious lemon cookies since we were celebrating.",

We showed her the call log which after looking as well they refused to accept us. Pathetic management, the simplest thing they could do put us on the log, that too they failed to do. On the contrary the lady at the front desk didn't even make any efforts to make it work she just said I'll have to put you on  the waitlist again. I would never come back here and wouldn't recommend to anyone. You guys disappointed us.",

    "text": "My \"star\" rating was at first a 3 then it went up to a 4.   I have never been here before. My husband went with me to South Park because I was part of an ASL event that was happening there. After it was finished we decided to get some dinner. We are huge fans of the Cheese Cake Factory but decided to try something different.   I went ahead and got our names on the list. They said it would be about 25 minutes and they handed me a little buzzer to hold on to. It was pretty busy but we didn't mind waiting. Our wait ended up being a little over an hour. At this point I was getting a little flustered.   Our buzzer goes off and we are taken to our table. The table had 4 check books on it which had yet to be taken. It took 25 minutes for any server to come to us. We had seen table after table be given water (all whom had sat down AFTER us). I told my husband we would wait 5 more minutes before we would get up, talk with a manger and leave. ((Don't get me wrong. I completely understand they get busy. I understand having to wait. But if we are not even acknowledged... that's when I have an issue))  After waiting 25 minutes, a server came. Her name was Kameron and she was the BEST part of our experience. She was super sweet and quick to place our drinks and food order. We never once made a fuss about having to wait for so long nor did we ask for a discount... but she didn't charge us for our soda or lemonade and she also got us a 15% discount. I was impressed with how she handled the situation. We didn't ask for anything in return, but here we had a wonderful young lady who made us WANT to come back again. Kameron, I hope you get to read this comment. You were a blessing and we can't thank you enough for doing what you did even though it wasn't asked. That was awesome. If I could give Kameron 10 STARS, I totally would.",

I've overall had really bad experiences with the \"take-home\" entrees, and mixed at best with the in-restaurant entrees. Sometimes they're good(not great), sometimes not so much -- usually the failure lands in the alfredo sauce.  The appetizers have been consistently good -- the mushrooms and the flatbread both stick in my mind even 6+ months since I stopped coming here.   The best comparison I can make is to Applebees -- the food is generic and the execution is inconsistent. If the execution and quality were always at the best I've had from this location, they'd be a solid 3.5-4 stars. For the price, though, the average quality of food isn't worth it.",

    "text": "Went here for a quick Valentine's dinner and had a really great time!  The restaurant was very busy and we were told that it would be around a 45 minute wait which is fair enough on Valentine's.  We were assigned a buzzer and went to sit down to wait.  Literally the second we sat down our buzzer went off.  45 second wait.  We were very pleased, though everyone else was probably not.    Service was sort of slow but very attentive!  Our server was Ben, and he was great.    The bread and oil that precedes the meal was very fresh and indicative of a good meal to come.  We also went for a glass of moscato and the \"bartender's choice\" special, which was a limoncello cocktail.  Both were great!  We went for the Eggplant Parmesan, and the Taylor Street Baked ziti.  Both of these were excellent.  If you've been to Maggiano's you're likely familiar with their key selling point - buy one take one.  That's right, with every pasta you order, they give you another one in a to-go container when the bill comes for you to take home.  Effectively, 2 entrees for $13.99.  Awesome deal!  Overall, I always have a great experience at Maggiano's and this location is no exception.  Beautifully laid out in front of Southpark and delivers on all accounts.",

In my opinion it was OKAY Italian food and I didn't think it stood out that much even compared to an Olive Garden.   The location is nice we were able to walk around SouthPark afterwards and I think the restaurant was super cute decor wise. Our waitress was nice was well.   I got bruschetta for an appetizer which was the best part of my meal experience. My bf got some type of chicken pasta and I got a steak with garlic mashed potatoes. I thought his chicken and sauce had good flavor. The spaghetti it came with was just normal spaghetti with lemon juice. The garlic mashed to me were not garlicky enough and could have just been regular mashed potatoes. My steak was cooked decently I didn't expect it to be impeccable being a Italian restaurant. My asparagus were cooked fine.   I unfortunately didn't understand the hype around it. Even looking at other people's orders around me nothing looked amazing. I definitely think other Italian places in Charlotte are worth the money more. I don't think I would come back.",

I have been too several locations over the years, but my most recent visits have been to this location. Although I love the atmosphere I have overall been disappointed with the service, starting at the hostess stand. They always seem to be too occupied and not that friendly.  The food is good, but nothing I would rush back for. It is great for large groups, which I definitely think they cater too. Overall, I would go back, but with too many amazing Italian restaurants in Charlotte this would only be by others choice.",

This location offered the same great food and we ate in the bar area, but the service was slower, things were left off our order, server did try to correct but then forgot to do the correction.  The restaurant was not too busy and we were only a few that were in the bar area at the time.  I did like the bruschetta appetizers very much, had a good glass of Port Wine and we did par take in the double pasta options that were well great as you have lunch for the next day!  I feel my main problem was with the staff and how they handled our table and most likely would not sit in the bar area again as they seemed to be understaff even with a smaller crowd.  I will look forward to table service the next time I go.  I have ordered ToGo orders and my order came home with me great and had no issues with it.  I do recommend this location just consider the bar if you want to concentrate more on your meal and service then having a drink.",

I wasn't all that impressed with either. Some of the bruschetta toppings were pretty good, but the bread was soft instead of crunchy like you would expect. The salad had iceberg lettuce which I wasn't a fan of. The toppings were pretty good, but the lettuce really took away from it.   Our service was pretty good -- no complaints in that area.

    "text": "Listen I don't typically do chains but I have to admit I really enjoy coming to Maggiano's.   The quality of their food is exceptional. I've never seen a piece of bad food come out. The service is just as superb. They really take care of you and you can tell they pride themselves on the service here. On my most recent visit, someone left a serving tray in the booth they sat us in and I sat on it. Honestly, I didn't think twice about it. But a little bit later the manager came and acknowledged what happened and apologized. That I thought was very nice. It's the little things that mean the most.   Now let's talk food.   My 7 year old who has an insatiable appetite can eat of the kids menu for $5 and be full is nothing short of amazing. Their kid serving size of lasagna is enough for an adult and their kids meal comes with dessert. Although, check your tab. On my last visit they charged me for ice cream when it is clearly stated on the kids menu that it comes with dessert.   There are three things I really love here:   1. Zucchini appetizer. It's sliced thin and lengthwise with super crispy coating and served with lemony creamy sauce. It's perfect when you lightly drizzle the sauce over the zucchini.   2. The mushroom ravioli. It's stuffed full of mushrooms and served in a cream sauce. I mean what's not to love?!   3. Calamari. While it's not my fave in town it's definitely the runner up. My son can easily kill this plate by himself. The calamari has a light and crispy batter. The calamari is tender and the marinara sauce is the perfect accompaniment.   I really enjoy the options on the menu where you eat now and take some home for later. It's such a great value.   And I can't recall the name on the menu but there's an option for dinner for two for around $45 where you get an appetizer or two salads, each an entree and a shared dessert PLUS you each get to take home a pasta dish. If that isn't winning, I don't know what is.",

I made one the same day. The staff are warm and welcoming. Upon entering I was greeted and asked to be seated upstairs. The person didn't communicate this to the \"runner\" or person who took us to our table. We got to the table and she only gave us one menu. So we were to share this with each other and wait until the other person finished reading it. Weird. We were soon greeted by the waitress who was nice and while we ate several ppl checked on us while we dined. It wasn't too crowded. The food was good. We chose items off the chef selection menu. I had the shrimp Benedict which was tasty. My friend had carrot cake pancakes which tasted delicious. The chef select is a limited time menu. The restaurant bathrooms were clean and spacious. Overall I will come again they have a happy hour and I'll check that out. Hope they work out the kinks at the front.",

    "text": "Maggiano's is one of the main anchor restaurants of SouthPark Mall. It's a pretty traditional Italian restaurant and has all of the traditional dishes one would expect.  Personally, I don't think it's anything spectacular.  Some items are better than others, and the service varies.  The tables in the center of the dining room are very close in proximity to one another and it can be a bit difficult to maneuver.  Reservations are encouraged, as they are typically on a wait.  The bar area, however, is first come, first served.  In my experience with reservations, I've still had to wait up to 30 minutes for my table on a Friday or Saturday evening.  I've also made special reservation requests in the past that weren't obliged, nor even acknowledged.  There is a second level and many private banquet rooms that are utilized for holiday parties, executive meetings, rehearsal dinners, etc.  The open dining area on the second level is often not used on slower nights and seems a waste when there is a long wait at the door.   I will say that they have one of the cleanest restrooms I've ever seen, and that is pretty consistent.  The two for one pasta offerings are also a really good deal.  This is a menu of select traditional pastas (i.e. lasagna, spaghetti, etc.) that can be purchased for dine-in and then guests are sent home with a second one to enjoy later.  It's great for lunch the next day.  I like that if my wife goes with a friend from work or with my daughter, she can still bring me home a pasta that is essentially free.",

Since Maggiano's is a chain, I really want to give it four stars because duh, that's what a snob would do. The food is delicious, but it's not mind-blasting. However, Maggiano's serves family-style, old-fashioned Italian dishes. They're not re-inventing the wheel, but they don't have to.  I have never had anything but great experiences here; the consistency alone would be enough for that 1 or 2 more stars. That and the calamari. Every restaurant should have calamari on the menu; calamari this good and with as many tentacles. The Shrimp Fra Diavolo and Fettucine Alfredo are my two classic and delicious go to staples at this restaurant.  The fare is traditional with few trendy takes on Italian food. Personally, I'm not one for goat cheese lasagna or short rib scampi or zucchini and eggplant tacos. A meal at Maggiano's sits in your stomach like five pounds of cement, the way a REAL Italian meal should. I know to wear my loosest & most forgiving pants when I dine here.  The service is courteous and attentive. The atmosphere is bright, roomy and elegant. I sort of wish they enforced some sort of dress code. Not just so that it would feel fancier but also because I abhor track suits and crocs in public spaces.",

I Love PASTA and Maggiano's does pasta right. NOTE: At this location I went to meet some business associates and arrived early (30minutes prior to meeting) and sat at the bar which is right when you walk in. I found it very hard for me to obtain a greeting, be offered a water, be offered a menu, etc.. Mind you there was 6 ppl in the bar area all standing around and drinking and I was the ONLY person seated. I am not the one to EVER make mention of the race card as I'm from the North and it's not as practical as it is in the South. This area is a very nice area and I actually have a guest house in the area, however as a young business professional of my race I am looked over at times which don't deter my mission or success it's just disappointing that people are still stuck in the early 1900's and don't feel that my race is successful. After several attempts to get the bartender to even come to where I was, I had one of the individuals who I decided to mingle with (very nice group) sit next to me and he asked what I was drinking and IMMEDIATELY the bartender came down to my seat and AGAIN didn't look at me he looked at the individual who directed him to get the order from me. He then took a deep breath and I greeted him with a SMILE as I am a professional and ordered my cocktail (I did watch him closely while making it as I don't want no Seely from The Color Purple mess, LoL).. Overall I LOVE Maggiano's Food however this location isn't ideal for me..",

The waitress recommended the dish and she was 100% on the money.

My fiance had the Chicken & Spinach Manicotti, which I sampled and admit was also awesome. The meal was awesome as was the service. Then we topped off our lunch with the Lemon cookies. If you're a fan of lemon, as I am, these cookies are for you.   Maggiano's is your place for spot-on, 100% Italian dishes. Plus you get to listen to some Frank while you dine.",

For larger groups, they serve 'family style', but the amounts they bring are obscene to the point where we all felt guilty, hoping that our leftovers were somehow donated to local food kitchens (if they do donate leftovers, please correct me!

The stuffing was also dry and frankly inedible. The ham was tough. The mashed potatoes were crunchy? I don't know what that was about. The three cheese ravioli was good & the baked ziti was just OK. We weren't too thrilled with the cheese cake & the tiramisu either. They were at best just OK. This was the consensus of the entire table. We took the chopped salad home which was very good at the restaurant but when we had it later that evening it had turned to pretty much turned to mush in just a few hours in the frig. Do you use metal or plastic utensils to chop the vegetables? If you're using metal utensils consider changing to plastic so the vegetables stay fresher longer. One bright spot was the service which was excellent. Unfortunately, based on quality of the food we will not be going back. It's a shame because we really liked Maggiano's but we spent over $200 on this meal (not including drinks) & we're not thinking this was just a \"one off\" when there were multiple dishes that were subpar.",

    "text": "This review is written with great disappointment and an empty stomach. After dinning here for several years with exceptional service and delicious food during nearly every visit, it is sad to say that Maggiano's- once one of the most decent and enjoyable Italian restaurants in the city- has become nothing more than another overpriced food chain who has surrendered standards of food quality for convenient, unsatisfactory practices that accommodate the new upscale-fast food pace of what was once a pleasant \"night out\" dinning experience. It is now Olive Garden with nicer decor and without the endless salad and bread sticks.  While the service from waiters and staff certainly still deserves praise and all five stars,the food, the main attraction, has lost all life, passion, and inspiration.   The fried mozzarella appetizer, though having some flavor and edible, came warm rather than hot. Giving the impression the dish had been prepared ahead of time and kept warm. The dish was just hot enough for the cheese to stretch somewhat, rather than steaming hot with an extra crispy crust.  The Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was completely flavorless. The most basic of the culinary cooking herbs could have gone a long way. Alas, despite our best efforts, no amount of complimentary salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese could resuscitate the bland white sauce and under cooked noodles.  The eggplant parmesan, one of my long time favorite dishes, was apparently on holiday vacation with the rest of the country because it certainly didn't show up to our table. Bread crumbs and heavy amounts of acidic red sauce atop spaghetti noodles summarizes this dish. No flavor. No texture. No presentation.   Of all the dishes brought to the table the mushroom ravioli and side spinach salad were the clear winners. Ample with flavor and reminiscent of what Maggiano's used to be. Unfortunately, this was not my order, and after three disappointments I did not feel compelled to change my order. Not even for the gnocchi with vodka sauce, another dish from the past I  have enjoyed, but could not bare to see fall short like the others.  Keeping in line with their excellent customer service, the chef did send home my original take home order of angel hair pasta and vegetables free of charge, despite the cancellation of my dine in order. While I am grateful for their gesture and commitment to patron satisfaction , sadly, the mushy noodles, catatonic sauce and vegetables did not amend for the very disappointing evening.   Perhaps it was the busyness of a Saturday night that threw a large lug into the evening's fare. Whatever the case I hope Maggiano's can recover quickly and reverse it's current decent into corporate dining mediocrity.",

We did and we're seated within 10 minutes. We were greeted by a very nice waiter Daniel.  Decided to kip appetizers and went right in for the entrees. Entrees were up within 15 minutes. I had the chicken alfredo added bacon and peas to make it more of a carbonara. Hubby had the lasagna. We were in shock of the food being up so quick. The food was hot, delicious and the flavor combination was superb. Best is with any of the classic pastas you get one to take home. We ended the night with Creme Brulee. Would recommend for date night, family, and events.",

    "text": "I have been to Maggiano's several times, in several cities, but my visit on Sept. 10 is worth noting. By far, one of the best experiences I've had there.  Right off the bat, our waitress was excellent. I was there with my husband and parents. My dad generally likes to joke around and have a good time with our server. Our waitress, Carol, went right along with it. She was funny, personable and had great recommendations - on dinner, wine and dessert. We also got a great table - a round booth, against a wall. The restaurant can sometimes get very noisy, especially on a packed Saturday night. The seat helped to block some of that noise.   The food at Maggiano's is very good. Typical Italian - salads, pastas, meat dishes. And you get A LOT of it. I have to say though, their classic pastas are one of the best deals I have ever seen. You order one of them at $12.95, and you get a second classic pasta, free, to-go. Great deal, great food. My baked rigatoni was delicious. Cheesy, with rich flavors, large chunks of tomato and spicy chicken. I took home the baked ziti, and it heated very well - almost as good as eating in the restaurant.  The table split a Chocolate Zuccotto cake and the special dessert - a peanut butter bar cake. That I wanted to like a lot, but was a little underwhelmed. The flavor was slightly bland - not as rich a peanut butter as I would have liked. The chocolate cake however... YUM-MY!! I am an admitted chocoholic. This was perfect. Moist cake with fluffy mousse and a thick chocolate frosting. I have to say though, if you're going to get it, it's wise to split!  On a side note, this is a great place for large groups. I have been for a few parties, and a few wedding rehearsal dinners as well. Maggiano's absolutely takes care of groups and treats them very well.",

I had a few helpings there.  Don't just a book by its cover!  The private room was suitable for our event and service was on point.  True to Italian flare, I believe I heard a little Frank Sinatra in the background during a quiet moment.  As we exited the restaurant shortly after 11 AM, the restaurant area was beginning to fill for lunch.  I look forward to visiting for lunch or dinner at another time.",

I don't know what it is but I keep coming back!  I have been with 2 to 6 people and the most fun is with a larger group so you can do Family Style which is great because you get \"refills\" on any of the items you run low on!! Now my family and I have been for 2 Christmas Eve's and this just really works for us! It's loud enough to make me sound like I'm whispering, and same goes for my Nephews who can sometimes be on the loud side :) We order Family Style so we all have to agree on whats going to hit the table and I will say between my sisters and I we get it all figured out, the men have no say!   Some of my favorite dishes are the Chopped salad that has Bleu cheese and avocado in it. The Tuscan Mussels are served with cannelloni beans and white wine and sun-dried tomatoes sooo good!! Next favorite the Fried Zucchini that is served with a Lemon Aioli sauce- Yum! Moving on the Baked Ziti and Beef Cannelloni are both great! For dessert I like the Pound Cake with Caramelized Bananas.  The service is whatever not over the top but not bad! They are always busy but they get you in and out!! I would definitely recommend it here even if it is a chain!!",

It's been a long time since we have had really good Italian food.  The portion sizes are very large, but so good.  The zuchini Fritte was delicious!  Perfectly paired with the lemon aioli dipping sauce. We ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and the Baked Eggplant Parmesan. For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu which they brought out with two pink candles bent in the shape of a heart and with one lighted candle!  It was a wonderful touch!

    "text": "If you don't want to eat at the food court then it's a good choice.  Maggiano's  also offers a little more reserved dining than the cheese cake factory which sits across the promenade.   We don't eat Italian out much (both having grown up  with parents once removed from the old country and with additional family living in Boston's North End where Italian restaurants and bakeries hire cousin joey for the sole reason he can speak English),  so we're hard to please being transplanted in the south.   The decor is nice and it was fairly quiet.  You notice that most of the wait staff are young people.  Our waiter spoke so softly we had to tell him to speak up.  He was a little eccentric and seemed to be inexperienced somewhat but he was pleasant and caring.  We enjoyed having him serve us.   We walked in at 3:15 and received the dinner menu which mirrors the lunch but more money.  The food was leagues above your normal run of the mill chain Italian restaurant as the likes of a Carrabba's \"Italian Grill\".   We started with stuffed mushrooms.  These were to be spinach, garlic with breadcrumbs.  I was looking forward to these.  They came six on the plate, decent size caps with a nice browning on the top and were absolutely tasteless.  BUMMA!   Not only were they tasteless but my wife spit out what looked like a piece of wrapping that was baked into the middle. Whatever it was, it was definitely plastic and therefore not digestible.  We brought it to our waiters attention who inspected it and said with a straight face \"that's disgusting\" followed by and apology and quickly removed the plate.  After he left we chuckled as it was quite humorous.  Don't think his manager would choose to have him say the word disgusting to diners!  Our waiter quickly returned to the table to notified us he had told the manager and \"put it into his hands\" so we should be hearing from him.  Again he made us laugh since he was obviously more grossed out than my wife and wanted no part of it.   The manager came shortly after and offered us a fresh order or something else free of charge.  We politely declined and thank him for his offer.  I had the chicken parm and it came with a side of spags.  The parm had a marinara sauce and the spags a house tomato. The menu read;  Chicken Parmesan Provolone & Marinara Sauce with Spaghetti  Marinara.   I'm assuming the sauces start off with the same base that gets shipped out to the 22 states they're in and they season from there.   The house on my side was most likely a mix up out back.  The marinara was decent!   I thought it could have used a little more oregano but I'm a huge fan of oregano.  I complain to my mom for not using enough.  The house was a little sweet for me and I only had a few forkfuls.  The chicken was thinly sliced from frozen cutlet with a piece of provolone on the top and baked.  Although from frozen, it was decent.  I ate them all.  My wife had the eggplant and she said it was decent too.  It came on a bed of spags and was more than enough for late lunch.   Our check came with a take home order and a piece of cheese cake on the house.  The mushrooms had been deducted from our check.  We added the 9.95 mushroom deduct to the tip because the waiter made us smile and seemed like a good kid. This was our first time to a Maggiano's.   It's unlikely we will return to Maggiano's.  If you're going out to dinner during your shopping and don't feel like the food court then it's in the running.  I can't see anyone driving to Maggiano's for dinner. There are way better choices all around the south park area.    I did see that they had family style portions on the menu and looks like it may be a good place for special occasions and/or large groups.",

The first thing I have to mention is the service.  I've only been to Maggiano's twice but both times our server was helpful, friendly and attentive.  When I asked about Gluten Free options, the chef came out to our table and discussed the possibility of substituting the gluten free pasta and even went in to detail about the sauces (most are gluten free) and the meatball (not gluten free).  While slightly embarassed by the scene of having a chef at my table, I felt much safer eating there and knowing the chef was aware that I had to avoid gluten.  The second thing that blew me away was the Classic Pasta Deal.  Basically, you order your classic pasta dish, which is about 4 portions worth of food and then FOR FREE you can order a second classic pasta dish to go!  I had to ask the waiter about 4 times if this was legit before I believed him.  The prices weren't outrageous, and I didn't have to pay extra for the gluten free pasta which was nice.  I would definitely recommend Maggiano's whether you're going out for a big family dinner, on a date or just with some friends",

The service was great considering the number of drink orders coming to the window!   Save yourself some time and order the Rigatoni D or Mushroom and Veal ravioli's. You can't go wrong with either.   This Maggiano's should be here to stay, great location in South Park.",

We had reservations so no problem getting in, although they sat us about 15 minutes after our reservation time (not a big deal).  The service was extremely slow.  Our waitress said they were catering a banquet for over 100 people next door that same evening so not sure if that factored into things.  There were four of us in the party and two ordered the surf 'n turf special on the menu.  We waited what seemed like 45 minutes for them to bring our entrees out. The two of us that ordered the special were very disappointed.  They didn't get the temperature right on either of our meats and the lobster tail was not cooked enough.  We told the waitress and the manager came by and said they would make them the right way.  Another 45 minutes later (I kid you not) and they finally brought out our plates.  I could not understand why re-doing our dinners was not made a priority with the kitchen.. seeing them serve all the other tables around us seemed to be more important to them.  The only saving grace was that they comped the entire meal.  Needless to say we won't be coming back here anytime soon.",

It looks fancier than Carraba's or Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden, and the food is at least as good as those places.  It is not, however, fine dining, and the food will range from good to mediocre.  It is a pleasant enough meal, but nothing exceptional.",

My family usually does Christmas Eve here and we always have a nice enjoyable experience, and its always crowded so it blocks out the noise my nephews tend to make!  Except one year we were taking pictures and some woman was giving us the evil eye, uh hello lady its a holiday and we have adorable kids all dressed up here, of course we're going to take pics!!  Stopped by Tuesday for a late lunch.  The bread they give is nice and soft and warm.  I then went for a house chopped salad, it comes w/tomato, avocado, bacon, blue cheese and I love it.  For my entree I went with the garlic shrimp with linguine.  I've had it a million times and its always great.  On other occassions I have loved the fried zucchini, mussels, stuffed mushrooms, caprese salad, braised beef cannelloni, baked ziti, chicken francese and the creme brulee.  Not sure if we're going for Xmas eve again this year but I like this place so I will return again and again.",

    "text": "We decided to celebrate another anniversary at Maggianos this year and I am so glad we did. We have a reservation at 6pm and were seated in less than 5 minutes.  We started with the mozzarella marinara which was nice thick slices of cheese breaded and fried and served topped with marinara and more cheese. I mean how could that be wrong?   I chose to get the Rustic Chicken and Shrimp minus the shrimp that I have ordered before but SO enjoy! It was very good with lots of chicken, mounds of pasta and a creamy sauce that kind of make you want to forget your table manners and slurp it up.   Hubby chose the center cut filet mignon. At $39, you would expect exactly what he got. Steak so tender it almost needed no knife and flavored crust that was perfct...even if a bit salty for my preference.  We chose the tiramisu as our dessert and it arrived with candles in honor of our anniversary!  It was rich, flavorful and absolutely delish! Our waiter put a couple of chocolate chip cannolis on the side as a extra anniversary treat and they were delicious too!  Speaking of waiter, we were lucky to have Dink who was helpful, funny and attentive. He was happy to offer suggestions when asked and make small talk without being obtrusive.   All in all a great visit!",

After we were seated our waitress arrived in no time to take our drink orders, go over the menu and bring out some bread.  That bread was so stinking good. It's not your typical restaurant bread. They are indiviauals rolls that you could dip in oil or spread butter on....ahhhh so good....BUT be careful! Too many rolls will force you to take most of your dinner home. (Trust me, I know!)   For my meal, I went with the Classic Pasta special. Basically you order one entree to eat there and another to take home and enjoy the next day!  How awesome is that???  I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatball dinner with meat sauce for there and the Taylor Street Baked Ziti (sausage, ziti and pomodoro sauce) to take home.   The spaghetti and meatball dinner was delicious it comes with your choice of mariana or meat sauce with one HUGE meatball. The spaghetti noodles were classic. But that meatball was the real winner. They put breadcrumbs and cheese in the meatball fillling and bake it to perfection. I enjoyed every bite. I definetly recommend it. I'll have to try the ziti and update my review with my thoughts on that!   When we were all done, dessert was not even an option, there was simply no room for it but for less than $15 we left full and happy.  Good stuff!",

Instead of guiding us as to what was good on the menu he was more interested in speaking about his own preference for food likings. Such as salad dressing. Ours lacked taste so I added more balsamic and olive oil and salt and pepper and it made it so much better. He said he does not like any salad dressings just likes the taste of lettuce. Who cares what he likes.   Then I ordered a glass of wine. After ten minutes I did not get it. He said it was because I had one to two ounces left in my glass!  Like are you serious?  Is he the wine police?  Basically I didn't get it because he was too slow.   I complained to the manager so he did take off our espresso martinis. When I got my bill the glass of wine I never received and the martini were on the bill. The waiter never apologized and instead made excuses.   Restaurant is very nice and I am not speaking on behalf of all waiters or waitresses that are are employed there. But Robert, find another job!",

So if I was dirt poor, in college, or needed to feed a little league team, I would eat here twice a week.  Unfortunately they miss a lot of important steps that would make me want to come back on my own.  Their fried zucchini is the heaviest version of this appetizer I've ever had.  I could hardly eat another bite of anything after it and it wasn't that enjoyable - dense and no seasoning, not even salt.    The bread they serve is just tiny little rolls.  Now I know why...  Everything else is so dense you don't need them.  I liked the meat sauce on their spaghetti but the meatball was stone cold on the inside.  So that was the end of that.  I didn't even bother sending it back.   There are too many other options nearby that are better and not that much more expensive.",

    "text": "We took a Sunday afternoon to specifically drive to Charlotte to go to this restaurant since all of their stores in our area have closed down.  Maybe that should have been a harbinger of what we would experience at this location, especially after we learned that a sister location in Charlotte, Romano's, had closed about two month's earlier.  We also had a gift card from Christmas that we wanted to use and we enjoy going to the shops in the South Park area of Charlotte on occasion.  The start of the experience had some high points, but that just left us at a higher level for a steeper fall as the meal progressed.  We got to the restaurant about 2:45 pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was about half full so we were seated immediately.    But then the waiting games began.  Part of the issue was the change of shifts, but they do this every day so it should not be an issue.  We had three different people introduce themselves as our servers and the first took the drink orders.  The second person brought the drinks, after about a 10 minute wait.  The third one ended up taking our meal order and giving us the bill.  In between there were several other people who delivered the parts of our meal.  And it is obvious that they either don't have a process for indicating which patron ordered what, or they were never trained on it if it exists, or they ignored it because every time something was delivered they either asked who ordered what or started to set it down and we had to direct them where it went.  Once a server even was ready to serve the food meant for the table beside us, who did happen to be seated after us, but realized he had three entrees and we were only two people.  Of course since I am big enough to be two people maybe he thought I ordered two meals.   They did bring out the bread and mixed up some Balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping and I must say it was excellent.  But we could have used more bread to enjoy more of it in the plate, but no one came by to ask if we might want some more bread. We ordered the meal for two which allows you to chose selections from each course. Mary ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana which came over a bed of Spaghetti.  I had the basic Spaghetti and Meatballs.   I also ordered 2 pieces of the Bruschetta w/tomatoes, garlic and cheese as an appetizer.  The first service flaw was when a server brought both the appetizers and the salad at same time on the same tray, so it wasn't accidental.  This was just the start.    The salads were there so we started on them, not being sure how quickly the entree would be there, and both Mary and commented on how good the salad dressing was, she had the Maggiano Salad w/o blue cheese and I had the Spiniach Salad, w/o onions.  We didn't need to hurry on the salads though because it was 45 minutes before our entrees arrived.  The food was excellent and they also give you an entree to go!  But while I like a break between courses, 45 minutes is more than a break.  And again, no one came around to ask if there was anything we needed, like refilling our drinks .   However, as good as the food was the service was that far on the opposite side of the scale.  Our server Kathy, only came to the table once to ask if we needed anything before we were finished eating.  Before I could respond, since I had just take a bite of food, she was gone.  And at that point my glass with water was 1/2 empty as was my glass of tea and she didn't recognize that they should be replenished.  And there were plenty of other servers re-filling drinks at the tables around us that never bothered to refill our drinks or even ask.  After we were finished with dinner there was another wait for the desserts, even though we had told her when we placed our order what we would be having.  When Kathy brought the bill she did ask if I wanted my drink refilled and I said no, just process my payment so I can leave.  There must have been signs around us or something because even the managers avoided coming to our table, yet they stopped at tables all around us to check if there was anything they needed and ask how their experience was.  As I said, several tables that were seated after us left before we did.  Now I will recognize that we did have more courses than they did but it should not have taken an hour longer.  If this is indicative of the service that the other locations are giving I can understand why they are closing.  Needless to say, I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone again.  But it has given me several stories about how not to provide customer service that I can use in my operations management classes.",

So we ordered the zucchini fritte as an appetizer, the rigatoni D for me, and the wife ordered the chicken and spinach manicotti. The zucchini tasted wonderful. Almost immediately after finishing the appetizer, the entrees arrived. My wife's food looked great, mine.... not so much. Not wanting to cause a seen, i attempted to eat it. Well, to me it tasted how it looked lol. It was very bland, the noodles were hard, and all the sauce was at the bottom. Needless to say, i did not enjoy this. After talking with our waiter, he got me another dish to replace my first choice. All in all, i enjoyed my visit here and hope to make my way back sometime in the near future.",

I was expecting a very old school Italian place, which still would've been nice, but this place was very nice! Food was amazing, and for the price even better! You can get an extra take home dish for free! They also have a light version of a few dishes for those counting calories. Our server was also very attentive and food came out before I knew it. Would def come back!",

Our party (7 total) had just come from two long days of off site meetings, so we were definitely ready to sit back and relax. Ericka - our waitress - got our night started right with a few happy hour specials. She had us laughing from the get go and was on top of her game all night.   I started with the small chopped salad. I should have just gone with the large one for my meal. I love the chopped salad from Maggiano's and order it every time I'm there. For my main, I went with the Gnocchi with Italian Sausage. Huge portion of pasta that I took close to half home. Gorgeous space. Had a great time and would definitely recommend this to any office groups looking for a place that can cater to a large party.",

The chicken was rubbery and took on the color of the spinach in my meal on the bottom of the chicken. The lemon butter sauce was the only saving grace. I ate that with the free bread that is given. My husband had chicken parm and did not care for his meal either but he ate it.  We got the 2 for $45 meals which included two free meals. I opted for the lasagne. Heated it up today per Maggiano's instructions. Totally gross! I truly don't get it. Thank Goodness I had a gift card. Definitely will NOT return. Sorry Maggiano's!",

Walked in and were promptly seated, menu's presented and subsequent orders taken a couple of minutes later.  My wife ordered the Veal Piccate while I opted for the Parmesan Pork. Both were excellent and I would recommend to anyone.  Service was great and as for the atmosphere, as far as Chains go, very good.

When we were finally seated, we realized they kept us waiting for no reason when the restaurant was literally almost empty! Then a lady kept coming to our table, worried about two chairs being empty, because it could be used for another table. REMIND YOU THAT THE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY. She really started to get on my nerves over two damn empty chairs. Our waitress was sweet though. But overall, I wouldn't come back to this restaurant.

We were able to try a variety of dishes including the calamari, salad, chicken parm, lasagna, and some desserts too. The calamari was good but the chicken parm was a little dry. The meat lasagna was by far the best dish we had. I really enjoyed the flavors and could have eaten more but everyone at my table felt the same way and polished off that dish quickly. We tried two desserts, a seven layer chocolate and mint cake (tasted like Thin Mint cookies) and their tiramisu. Both fantastic. If it wasn't for the company picking up the tab though, I probably would not make this my first choice when it comes to Italian places.",

    "text": "Maggiano's is a very well known upscale Italian Restaurant.  My family dines there whenever they visit Chicago.   The food quality, service, and atmosphere are superior to any Olive Garden or \"chain\" Italian places!  Normally this place is a little dressy but the one here ranges from casual to a suit & tie. Either way it's not a snooty place at all and still very elegant. The restaurant was rich & the environment was very cool and they were playing Sinatra! The ambience was a hit!  The food portions are extremely generous! The food is delicious! The price is very affordable. Although there are more affordable options we selected a special that cost $30 per person but you get to pick 2 salads, 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts....here's the kicker: You get unlimited refils on everything!!! Yes they'll bring out more salad, more appetizers, and more everything. If you go there with your family you will leave fat & happy + they'll box it up to go.  Everything is made from scratch! The dessert was SO great! It was fresh! I had NY style cheesecake and not only was it enough for two men to eat but also it was incredibly enjoyable, and tasted like it never spent a day in a freezer :-)  Same thing goes for the Tiramisu my wife ordered! OMG it was authentic tasting, huge, and downright yummy!  The service here is outstanding! Our waiter was very professional and efficient. He was pleseant and never rushed us at all.  I highly recommend this place and it goes to the top of my list of Italian restaurants! My #2 fav place in Charlotte so far!  If you want some \"above the rest\" Italian food then you need to try this place. You will love it!",

Service wasn't awful, but I could tell the hostess and our server wasn't giving it all of his all. The bread is delicious though! I ordered the Clam Linguine w/ white wine sauce and my friend ordered the Chicken Marsala. I really didn't like my clam linguine that much. The way it was described on the menu wasn't what I saw in front of me. Had shells and them clam mixed into the pasta. There was also a lot of wine sauce and oils that I wish they drained before placing in my bowl. It just wasn't seasoned to my taste and I feels as if the ingredients they use should be tweaked. My friend's Chicken Marsala was also sub par. Once again plating was an issue... Her chicken and mushrooms were on a plate and her pasta was in a small bowl. It was just odd since she basically had to put it together herself. We've been to other nice restaurants where the server would do it for us or either ask us if we wanted it separated. When we got our ticket, I told the server that I had a $10 off $30 coupon (main reason for visiting) and It took him 3 times to get the check right. I'm glad I can say I've been here but we should've walked over to the Cheesecake Factory.",

    "text": "I've been to Maggiano's three times in my life, and I'll have to say 1-star rating is one too many for all three experiences.   We had an early evening reservation, and it was 10 minutes until the wait staff stopped by to greet and take the drink order. The family ordered the \"Classic Family Style\" dinner. We had fried calamari, spinach salad, and Italian sausage & roasted peppers for appetizer. The calamari was slightly over seasoned and average at best. The spinach salad was over dressed and soggy. The italian sausage was served in a pool of greasy sauce. The sausage itself was average, and I could have bought better sausage across the street at Whole Foods and made a better version at home.   For the main course, we ordered linguini with clams, chicken saltimbocca, eggplant parmesan, and grilled salmon. If I had to guess, salt must have been on-sale this week. Since most of the clam meat in the linguini came from cans, this entree already started with a high doze of sodium. The linguini was probably also cooked in salted water. To top it off, the cooks must have popped the top off the salt shaker and dumped a half canister of salt in the clam sauce.  Next, the chicken saltimbocca must have been made by the same cook that made the linguini. It was again over seasoned. In fact, it was so salty that it made the prosciutto taste like sweet ham. The chicken, in addition, was forgotten in the oven too long and was dry like a cardboard. The third entree is the eggplant parmesan, and it was again extremely salty. The eggplant had more breading than eggplant. I also don't remember seeing a speck of parmesan in the entree. In all fairness, I cannot comment on the taste of the salmon since I didn't sample it. However, the reason why I didn't sample the salmon is because it was completely overcooked and the fish was bone dry when I cut into it with the serving spoon.   For desserts, we ordered the creme brulee & tiramisu. The desserts would probably have been the only enjoyable parts of the dinner if we had eaten them on-site. We ended up boxing the desserts and took them home before they even made it to the table. I sampled both desserts the next day. The creme brulee wasn't extraordinary. The caramelized sugar was flamed just right. It is a bit awkward to eat creme brulee from a plastic takeout box instead of a ramekin. It came with a few slices of fresh strawberries which I find a bit strange. The tiramisu definitely deserved its name. I could taste the rum and the expresso. The lady fingers had the perfect consistency. The quality shaved chocolate garnish added extra depth to the tiramisu.",

The Mushroom Ravioli al Forno is a close second, for my vegetarian days.   Appetizer: Fried zucchini was not what I expected, it was WAY better!  Large lengthwise slices of crisp zucchini breaded and perfectly fried and served with a creamy Parmesan dipping sauce.  Stuffed mushrooms are equally good. Dessert: APPLE CROSTADA.

    "text": "It sounds weird, but growing up in an Italian household, you'd think I'd love going out for Italian food, right?  Quite the contrary.  I guess I had too much as a kid, so I usually bypass Italian restaurants to choose other ethnicities or flavors.    I had my first experience at a Maggiano's at this particular Charlotte one.  First, the entrance and decor of this uncharacteristically chain Italian restaurant makes you think you're walking into a fine dining establishment, but being that it's in a mall, it was casual (although not overly; don't go dressed there in your cut-offs (do they still make those?) and tank top).  I was with a very large group (about 20 people), so we had a huge table in the middle of the room and tried their Family Style Dinner choices.  I was neither ordering nor paying, so I went along with whatever was selected.  I must admit that I did not have a single bad thing and nothing tasted typically Italian or \"chain-y.\"  Plus, I got to sample so many things that my taste buds were alive and kicking.   Everything was so wonderful (of course, the red wine helped!) and I had to change my opinion a bit about Italian restaurants...especially this one.    I've returned to Maggiano's since then, this time with family visiting from out of town.  We had originally tried to go to the Cheesecake Factory next door, but the wait was two hours long.  We walked into Maggiano's and, seeing that it was very crowded as well, were pleasantly surprised that we were seated within 10 minutes.  This time, we ordered individual entrees instead of the shared plates.  I tried the delicious Chicken Pesto Linguine which was full of chicken and pesto flavor.    I'm definitely a fan of Maggiano's and recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional and unusual Italian dinner experience, even those not into chain restaurants.",

Once they insisted (after we'd already waited 45min w/a reservation!) that a baby be counted as a full person (mind you, this was a newborn being carried by mom) thus we'd need a table for five, not four, and this increased our wait even more. We left and went to Harper's (Yummy!).   Another time, they wouldn't seat us on time b/c our entire party hadn't aarrived yet. Are you kidding me? You are going to give away our reserved table instead of letting us start our night w/cocktails and apps? Five of us were there, two were 10 minutes away; adding insult to injury, they squished us around a small table when we were finally seated.   My friend must've been wearing some sorta cloaking device b/c everytime she opened her mouth the waiter didn't even acknowledge her existence. It actually became kkinda comical.  You know, I'vd put up w/some pretty crappy service for some awesome food, but if you are going to be a schmuck, you'd best put your money where your mouth is and offer me something more than a step above Olive Garden.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely delicious!! I cannot believe I haven't tried it sooner! I got the Shrimp with Orzo (special). It wasn't a lot but after I ate it I realized it was a perfect portion because I was able to get some Tiramisu which is soooo good. My fiance got the Four Cheese Ravioli, and I tried some. I have never known food to melt in your mouth, and besides that I hate a bunch of cheese together, but in this dish you can barely tell. The season and sauces where a GREAT blend. My fiance also got the New York Style Cheesecake, which was also delicious. I will be back!!",

He got the lasagna which was absolutely heavenly, and my spaghetti was delicious as well! Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "i typically do not enjoy going to any chain restaurant but maggiano's changes that for me. i have been there a few times and have never been disapointed. im used to going for italian food in boston, providence and nyc so the food is not really authentic but it is really good americanized italian. i have had the regular menu and the family menu. either way we have always left with lunch for the next day. their to go containers are really cool as well. the containers have food reheating instructions and you put the container right in the oven to reheat and it tastes just like how it tasted the day before. we really enjoyed sitting in their outdoor rotunda area. it made us feel we were not even in a mall.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurant's in Charlotte.  The amtmosphere alone makes it a pleasure.  On top of that the staff a friendly and quick to make suggestion what is good on the menu.  Menu has a wide variety of item to please just about anyone.  If you want to get a table would suggest making a reservation.  Deserts are not that large, however definetly pack with plenty of flavor.  Their Cheesecake in my opinion is better than Cheesecake Factory.   Excellent choice for special events or a networking luncheon.  You can even dine ouside on the patio during certain times of the year.  Overall a must for the Foodie inside us.",

    "text": "OK, so 5 stars might be a bit too generous, but the food is very good at Maggiano's and the service was very good too.  Charlotte's Maggiano's is located on the Sharon Road side of Southpark Mall.   As another review mentioned, the place is loud (almost too loud) and it's also pricey (figure $50 per person if you have drinks).  We at family style and we had too many dishes to mention, but they were all excellent, and the food kept coming all evening.  I estimate that there were two hundred patrons  - the restaurant is huge.  This is a good place for large groups, but not as good if you want a quiet evening.  I would eat here again.",
