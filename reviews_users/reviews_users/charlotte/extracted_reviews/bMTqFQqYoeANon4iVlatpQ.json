In fact, he has a frown on his face all the time.  They don't appreciate the business and don't even ask how everything was or thank you for coming. The owner, Chris, walks around and doesn't even talk to the people.  We went a few times, but the food was so awful and the servers very unprofessional.  I never has one thing that was good.  The menu is so big including all the specials that they should scale down and learn to cook a few good things good and hire a REAL CHEF!  The hostess doesn't smile and dresses with a see thru top with her red bra straps showing.  How unprofessional!!!  We will never, ever set food in Jimmie's Restaurant again!!!",

Their breakfast is great (get the French Toast), lunch is good, (burgers, sandwiches, homemade chips) dinner is \"meh,\" (typical diner fare).  Not sure why there are so many complaints about the service.  I have had servers who were not as good as others, but never had any to complain about.  The one complaint I do have tho,  doesn't have anything to do with the wait staff, but with the restaurant itself.  Do you really need to be so Gestapo about ending breakfast at 11 / 12 weekdays / weekends? I have had servers literally run back to the kitchen with my breakfast order to beat the 11:59:59 weekend deadline.  I have also been in line at 11:30, seated at 11:55 (Sundays are VERY busy) and because my order didn't make it to the kitchen before the aforementioned deadline, I was denied my beloved French Toast Combo (2 eggs, choice of meat, 3 pieces of French Toast)  C'mon Jimmie...lighten up!",

    "text": "Jimmie's is your typical Greek/American restaurant with a standard menu, daily specials, and 4-5 actual specials placed on the board.  The restaurant is larger than most restaurants of this nature, and provides a variety of seating choices: tables, booths, and even a party room.  There is plenty of parking and access is easy.  The food is consistent and usually good.  Service depends on the waitress you get, but all are average or above.  These ladies work in a busy high volume restaurant, so I cut them some slack.  They do get busy at times and serve a variety of clients, from the hard working blue collar guy to the occasional celebrity (no I'm not talking about myself).  The place also has a good display of desserts - both a positive and a negative, mostly a negative right now for me as I am trying to lose a few pounds.  If you have not eaten here, give this place a try, and if you see Jimmie - tell him Eddie sent you by his way!",

Most entrees are less than $10. Portions are what I'd expect from a sit-down restaurant like this (comparable to Applebee's or O'Charley's portion sizes). Highly recommended.",

Being a breakfast fan, I appreciated their food.... this place does get super busy on Sundays though - If you have time to burn I'd definitely check this Mint Hill spot out - not if you are in a rush though!    I had the Popeye Salad (spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, I opted not to put the feta cheese on and put baked salmon instead with a balsamic vinaigrette).  Good size and taste... the salad was definitely more rustic in that most of the veggies were very rough chopped (if at all) so you get big slices of mushrooms and halves of roma tomatoes - I didn't mind at all.  Service was nice, but they got so busy when they had a lunch rush our server didn't come back to check on us - we weren't needing anything else but refills so we survived.",

My eggs are never warmer than room temperature.  The grits come up already half hardened and the omlettes....all it is is eggs with stuff in it, they do absolutely nothing special to them.    I'm not a chef and any breakfast I cook in 10 min is far better than anything I have had at this dive.    Bottom line:  places like this are only in business bc it is a family establishment and bc some people are too foolish to try a new place that serves decent food.",

The menu contains pretty typical American food. Prices are fine. Food is fine. The service is hit or miss. We are usually greeted (if that is what you can call it) by a young and not so happy to be there hostess, and then after a good wait, we get sat. Service is slow, but for the most part the waitresses have been kind enough. We usually wait a long time for the waitress to take our order, then wait a long time for the mediocre food, then wait a long time for the check. Then wait at the check-out counter for somebody to acknowledge us. The atmosphere leaves you with a sense of nobody really cares, and nobody has any pride in the place. I know this place gets busy and the staff is stretched, but I feel that something, anything should be GOOD. But it is just...fine, I suppose. After writing this review I will remember my words \"I don't think I will be back.\"",

    "text": "I've always enjoyed the breakfasts here but dinner can be spotty and after tonight, I won't be back.  My son and I found the original booth we were seated in to be uncomfortable; one bench too close to the table and one too far away and nothing was adjustable. I asked the hostess for another booth and she gave us one, but only after trying to convince us to stay where we were. Quite rude about it, even though there were other booths and tables available.  We ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, my son got the chicken fingers and I got the nightly meatloaf special. The sticks were delivered by someone other than our waitress, who had a large serving tray with everything else going to the table behind us; she dropped down our plate of cheese sticks without a single word to us, just set it on the table and left. I find this to be unbelievably rude. Even just a simple 'enjoy!' or 'here you go' is fine.  I had to have someone send my waitress over so I could ask her if I was getting the soup and bread basket that are included with every special. She said, 'yeah, you can have the soup...it's vegetable; we don't bring out the soup and bread basket unless you ask because we don't want to waste it.'  WTF? I'm PAYING for that in the price of my dinner! Don't tell me you're not bringing it out because I didn't request it!  So you guessed it, she brought the soup and bread with the dinner, so of course, I didn't eat the soup. And it got wasted.    Which didn't really matter, because it wasn't hot anyway. In fact, the only thing that was hot were the mozzarella sticks. Everything else was at best lukewarm.  When I left, the guy at the register asked how was dinner, so I said 'mediocre' and told him what had happened. (I had pre-warned my son that I would, so he was waiting outside!) He said the waitress shouldn't have said the soup and bread came only if you asked; that if you order the special you got them automatically. I handed him my cash, which was the exact amount and turned to go. He offered me my money back, but I didn't take it, because that wasn't the point.  The point was...your restaurant is falling apart. Rude service, sub-par food, and you're cheating your customers who pay for soup and bread but don't receive them. I hope you will take my comments to heart.   That was the point.",

Booth was comfortable and also sparkly clean. The meals were all quite reasonable, I had the turkey with dressing. It came with gravy, cranberry sauce and choice of two sides. I opted for a salad and fried squash. The lettuce on the salad was wet and it made the dressing run, so I wasn't very happy with the salad. The fried squash was so good. It was lightly fried with very little breadcrumbs, the flavor was just superb. The turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce was all very good, the stand out was the dressing. What a wonderful surprise when I got to it under the turkey. It was like a hidden prize. I do not know what was in it, but it was just the right amount of spices, vegetables, and breadcrumbs. I would certainly return and get this dinner again. The service was also excellent. Hubby had pork, it looks yummy and he cleaned his plate. Other friends had something Italian which came with garlic bread.  Great job Jimmie's.",

They seem to employ anyone that says they are a cook now as I've been told the original cook that was there when I moved down left, the food is extremely inconsistent now and so is the service. Their are a select few servers that are great but it doesn't really make up for what you get to eat.   I'm writing this review because this will be the last time I eat here. I went to dinner with my parents and usually I will pass up eating here unless its breakfast but I decided to go with. We were seated in a pretty bad spot a door way, who wants to sit in a doorway? So as usual our order is taken and pretty uncomplicated, 1 BLT, 1 Club sandwich, 1 Cheese burger and an order of fried pickles. we get our drinks and a few minutes later we get our pickles. After we finish our appetizer we noticed that 2 families that came in 10-15 mins behind us get their food first and each of the 2 tables didn't get their food at the same time so there was about 5 minutes between each. Finally our server tells us our food is coming, Really? 5 minutes later we finally get our food everything is alright except no Club, at this point I didn't want to wait any longer so I just ate the BLT I was served. I did enjoy the 3 pieces of bacon and the whole tomato(I'm not kidding it was literally an entire tomato sliced onto this sandwich) I was served.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the same shopping area I'd recommend eating there and if all else fails a Publix is located across the street.   Farewell Jimmies you were once great.",

Instead, one only has to note that their parking lot was completely full from the time we arrived at 10:45 a.m. to the time we left at noon on a Monday? The locals obviously love this place!  For what it's worth; however, here's my review... I elected to go with my old standby the chicken parm. It was a daily special and was served with a small salad and garlic bread for around $9. Their house made red sauce is very sweet but still tasty. The portion size was a bit smaller than other Greek restaurants I have reviewed. There was nothing special about the salad and the garlic bread was good but a bit greasy.  My friend was very excited about his chicken pot pie, fried okra and 3 bean salad. The pot pie was loaded with large chucks of chicken and the okra was fried perfectly.  The sanitary rating was an impressive 98 and the atmosphere very appealing. Service was fair. Overall, it was a little better than average; yet again, the full parking lot suggests its regulars think more highly. Although not a Gotta Try, I suggest giving it a try and deciding for yourself.",

Second, the fried pickles where not too great. Now I have had an issue with fried pickles with many restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I did not put very much weight on this one dish. We moved on to the entree. This is where the nightmare begins. If they just brought me the turkey with nothing else I would have been all right. Unfortunately it came with stuffing made out of bread, cranberries, cinnamon, apples, and what I can only assume was an old inner tube. The entire concoction was drenched in a gravy that was laced with red peeper, some kind of green flecks, and more red pepper. I have never gotten heartburn from turkey and dressing before, but I guess there is first time for everything. The mashed potatoes where also slathered with this \"Death Gravy\" so they did not make the grade as well.   The waitress wanted to get something else for me and I ordered a cheese burger as a consolation but, by the time I had gotten it the stomach pains had become unbearable, so we decided to cut our losses and pay the bill. The manager rang us up, but was very rude to us. It was if he was blaming me for not eating his crappy food.",

Guy at the register was friendly and welcoming.  Coffee wasn't too fresh, just ok.  My waitress, Melanie was patient and terrific .  I'll be back!  Linda",

He didn't follow up after delivery, didn't refill our drinks, didn't deliver the bread with our meal !!! Their food however was fair. The Alaska Whitefish was spicy, a little salty but enjoyable. Green beans delicious, the mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth. Their fries were average. The broccoli was tender but bland.",

Nice portion of chicken sitting inside of a pita bread that had a toothpick in it to shape it like a bowl. Dressing was great. The salad was awesome, tziaziki sauce was on point. Deserae was my server. She did an outstanding job. Friendly and professional. I felt comfortable and not rushed. I tend to eat slow and enjoy my food. I would recommend this restaurant highly especially if you enjoy Greek cooking. The menu looks great for any taste bud. Lots of choices. All the plates that I saw going by me looked delicious as well. One plate had delicious looking gravy over Fried Chicken. Mmmmm.....When I'm in this part of town and need great food, great service in a clean and friendly establishment. You'll find me here.  2 thumbs up",

They use to serve very decent collard greens, but not this visit. I noticed a older crowd gathers there(which I'm not mad about) I think I will leave them alone for about  a year, and then go back... maybe they'll have a new cook by then.",

    "text": "I'm not very impressed with this restaurant. There are some positives, but most are negative. I believe my family will drive further in Charlotte to get our \"diner\" fix.   Pros: Reuben is decent. It has a good taste, but my bread was completely soggy. Pickles tasted very old, and veggie casserole was okay- at best.   My husband had some Cajun fish that he loved. He said it was great.   Cons:  Service! Service is everything when your working in the restaurant business. My husband went to pick our order up- as we had called ahead. When my husband arrived they had already given our order to someone else. The server simply said, \" someone's already picked that up\" we had to get management involved. They made our food again. They didn't offer us any discount for the mix up or the long(ER) wait. 10% off would suffice- anything would have been a good gesture.   Salad- the salads are very watery. I don't know if it's the ranch dressing, but it's not very good. Also I asked my salad to be prepared with mixed greens. They assured me the salad came with mixed greens. I ordered the chicken salad. It came with 4 very small pieces of grilled chicken and iceberg lettuce. Not very good   Veggie ( in my case broccoli) casserole- the taste was bland. Just tasted like broccoli with some cheese.     Overall we will no longer be going to this restaurant. Such a shame because we love right around the corner!",
