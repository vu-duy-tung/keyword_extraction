I ordered the steak tacos; the steak had an almost burnt taste to it with absolutely no seasoning. The entree came with black beans and mexican rice, they were both also VERY bland. The service also was pretty bad; my waitress was very slow. I sat there for 15min before she even asked me if I wanted a drink. I definetely don't recommend this restaurant.",

The server came by got our drink order, came back with the drinks in a reasonable amount of time, but then took our food order and disappeared. 25 minutes later we caught the waiter walking by and asked him to check on our order. We were not rude, said sir and everything. He didn't even verbally respond, just looked at us. Then came back with my food but not my boyfriend's saying they were out of chips. He had ordered nachos. Really? When we were upset that he hadn't told us that and said the service sucked he got pissed at us. Again, really? You never check on us, you never check on the order and when you finally do it is because we asked you to. Didn't even get an apology. So YES, your service SUCKS. Don't even bother. Go to 1897 Market where we ended up going (left my entire meal untouched at the other restaurant) and they are awesome!! And yes we paid for two meals, you can guess who got a tip and who didn't.",

The restaurant was clean and uncrowded.    The house margaritas we ordered were delicious, generously sized, served in shakers, and left us all delightfully buzzed so we could better tolerate the oppressive coach seating  on our transcontinental flight.    The waitress informed us the restaurant only pours Cuervo because the company that owns Jose Cuervo also owns the restaurant.   Everyone in our group commented on how much they enjoyed their food.  My husband loved the crab cakes he was served.  The carnitas quesadilla I ordered was incredibly good.  Each person in our group was pleasantly surprised with the superior quality of the food and drink we were served. Such high caliber and tasty offerings are a welcome relief from the bland fare usually served at most airport restaurants.   I look forward to visiting this restaurant again the next time I travel to Charlotte. .",

I know, my first problem was going to a \"Mexican\" restaurant in North Carolina, but the sit-down choices were slim.    Our waitress was very nice.  She was great, I want to be clear on this.    The Jicama Salad was terrible.  Laid on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce was six huge (3/4\") Jicama sticks, four slices of cucumber, and some diced tomato.  The Jicama managed to be chalky and flavorless.    The tamales were also horrible.  They were dry and crunchy.  Aren't tamales steamed?  They failed in the taste category as well.  They came with a rice that might have also been served as really bad fried rice.  I'm still not sure what was in it.    The \"Millionaire\" margaritas ($14, *cough*) would have been great had they been called \"limeade\" and cost a fifth the price.  There may have been tequila in it, I'm not sure.    The total for a salad, two tamales, and two margaritas?  $45, ugh.",

And no, I don't want a shot of tequila (for just $2 more!) with my beer.  Food is just ok...sort of a faux-Mex. But the rudeness is what kills this place.

I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and asked server if I could get it with \"raw onions\" rather than \"sweetened pickled onions\" and was informed that they were not available though the vegetarian menu stated  \"onions\" as part of the dish, not to mention he did not even attempt to inquire if that would be a possibility.  3. Our server did not check on the status of our food until prompted to do so.   The result one of the worse tips that I've ever given and not the most pleasant experience.",

No, I never could have dreamed a 12-ounce drink would cost $17!) Came out warm and watery. It's like it had sat, iced for an hour before I ordered it. The food was worse. Greasy chips with average salsa and queso that tasted like thick milk. Thank god my BF and I made the decision to share tacos. I don't think I could have made it through my own \"plate\" of food. The taco shells were so flimsy/soggy from sitting for who knows how long, when we attempted to pick them up they totally disintegrated. We doused them in cohula and choked down one each (out of a serving of three) using a knife and fork. Shame on you, Charlotte Douglas. Just because you have a captive audience of travelers doesn't mean you can get away with serving this crap. Never again! I'll pack a brown bag lunch before I eat from a HMSHost joint again.",

We happened to find this place while venturing down to Miami last March 2012.  The service was great!  The margaritas were delicious and the salsa and chips were just what we were craving.  I wish I could remember her name, but its been almost a year now, the waitress/bartender was so accomodating.  She even let me charge my phone while sitting at the bar.  We liked this place so much that the following month we were flying down to the Bahamas, we stopped here and saw her again, while enjoying the margaritas and nachos.  We had a layover on the same trip, except on our way back to Buffalo and had to stop once more!  It has now been almost a year since we have been here.  I have tried coordinating our past two trips through the Charlotte airport (I know, crazy!) just so we could stop here but I have been unsuccessful.  My most recent Miami trip took me through Atlanta and the whole time I wished they had a Tequileria.  Our next trip down South better encompass the Charlotte Airport because we really want to go back!  This place is the perfect spot to kick-start your vacation! (Or end it)",

The cupboards are worn out and falling off the hinges.  Bar tenders are fast which is nice if you have a plane to catch but for long lay-over folks, feels like you're being forced to choke down your beer to free up a space for the next customer.  Didn't try the food so no idea how that is but based on the smells, you'll want to try another place. Barbacoa quesadilla looked good based on the guy next to me but I couldn't bare the thought of trying one for myself.  My one positive comment is that the beers are cold and the margaritas are the best bang for your buck.

Throughout my business travel in & out of CLT weekly for the past two years I much rather grab food at any other restaurant prior to arriving at CLT as the selection is crap & once you think you see a great place such as this one, you are in for a terrible surprise. I ate here twice the only reason I went the 2nd time is because management contacted me after I complained & left my business card & I was left assured that this wasn't the type of service that the restaurant was built on (my terrible prejudice experience).  Low & Behold let me explain my 2nd visit, it went a lil something like this: I entered the restaurant & because it's seat yourself I found a cozy seat on the back wall where tables to my left & right were empty. I begin to sip my FiJi (water already on the tables for purchase) & watched servers go around & around on this very unbusy day & not one checking on me or acknowledging me. I began to think I sat in a bogus section & proceeded to pack my things up to move until two groups of ppl walked in & sat at the tables next to me. As quick as they sat someone was there to serve them & greet them which prompted me to ask if there was a different server for the middle table? I was again ignored & then that was followed by the waitress asking \"is there anything I cab get you\" I replied \"definitely I would like proper customer service as the other guest who are not of my race are receiving\" she rolled her eyes up into her thin blonde head & said \"would you like something to drink\"? I smiled, declined & exited the restaurant to NEVER return again in LIFE not even if I'm stuck in CLT & starving as the food wasn't that tasty anyhow (I ate my 1st visit & only returned because of my phone call from the manager & the good margarita I had).",

It was basically a pile of very old, wilted,  turning-brown lettuce with a bland, unappetizing-in-appearance chicken breast on top.  I asked for Ranch dressing instead of the creamy tomato dressing that comes standard with this salad, and got two to-go packets of Ken's Steakhouse Lite Ranch (which, now having tried, I do NOT recommend). Beverage was unsweetened iced tea with lemon-just on the ok side of stale.  I am very picky about the freshness of my iced tea.  Atmosphere was crowded and loud.  Check came back wrong, and it took a manager to come fix it which they did quickly and cheerfully.   But sadly an overall below average lunch. I won't be back. :(",

It was super dissapointing -- starting with a very dry tortilla AND extremely sad contents. Other than beans, it had some pieces of corn  i.e. apparently the corn made it a veggie burrito. Hmm, how about some sauteed zucchini/ onions, etc that are actually vegetables? Upside:  the salsa that came with the burrito (no chips) was good. Maybe go somewhere else if you're craving Mexican -- Salsarita's?",

I stayed with the grilled chicken, and it tasted like it was boiled, no texture, I am not even sure what I put into my mouth.  Suffice to say, stay away from the chicken. The cheese sauce, what they call \"queso fresco\" is nothing at all fresco and all disgustingo. Their dressing is equally disgusting, not even remotely considered \"mexican\" nor is it fit for human consumption. Beware of the bacon bits, if they were repurposed for doggie treats, I'd feel obliged to call the ASPCA for inhumane treatment.  I ordered the Platino Margarita, pretty sure It was $17, it calls for fresh lime juice they put some premixed stuff in a bottle into my drink and called it a day. Even the drink was subpar and worth less than half the cost that they charged.   If you happen to land in Charlotte because American Airline sucks and refuses to help you out, stay away from this restaurant. Even their customer service sucks, which surprisingly is the least of their problems. Decor is not bad.",

    "text": "This place was great!  Living in So Cal, you get a good idea of what Mexican food should be. These guys got it right!  I had the Chopped Taco Salad and an order of chips/salsa. The salad was fresh, crisp and had a large tender grilled chicken breast. I got dressing on the side. Overall, really good.   The chips and salsa are enough for two.... the chips are thin and crispy and warm. The salsa, well, pretty sure it was from a jar, but it was a very good jar!  Service was nice and pretty quick. I will admit it was not too busy which was why the quick service. But if you want a good lunch or dinner, eat here!  I'll come back again, the next time I'm through Charolette.",

While the nachos were non traditional with shredded/blended chicken and the margaritas were pricy, they were delicious. We ordered two of the nachos because the first was not enough to fill us up for our flight. The margaritas were seemingly endless and left us feeling tipsy before our flight. We will be back because CLT is becoming our new home-base airport!",

But it was the cheapest ( rice and beans) most filling option in the airport (I try to find rice and bean options when having to eat in airports) But each item was probably about 6 oz ?

The extent to which they cut corners here shows, even in the most basic of dishes. The rice was dry, the beans had zero texture. The tacos my husband ordered were clearly just microwaved meat and cheese on a tortilla. Everything seems like it's been sitting around for days, and is just tossed onto a plate. Even the salsa, which also rarely is a disappointment in most places, was no good - it just tasted like pureed tomatoes, with a heavy dose of added onion. Service was slow, and we had to wait a long time for our check, which is a cardinal sin in airport restaurant. My expectations weren't high, but this place was worse than expected. Plus, it was early in the day, and the menus were already filthy (who knows how long ago they had been cleaned...think about how gross that is, especially in an airport). Frankly, this place couldn't get anything right. Skip it - you're better off eating at 1897, on the other side of the atrium.",

The reason you are eating here is because your flight was cancelled and suddenly you have five hours to kill at CLT airport.  That's why I ate here last Friday night, and that's the only reason anybody eats here.  The place is full of tired, grouchy travelers, with their luggage stacked all over the floor and on the seats, and all that anybody just wants is to get the hell out of that airport and go home. It's depressing.   Don't try to compare this place to a good local Mexican place in your own neighborhood.  Anyhow -- I ordered chicken enchiladas, which were revolting. They tasted like fish, not chicken, and they were swimming in a watery green sauce.  The refried beans were like wallpaper paste.  I ordered a draft beer, which tasted slightly suspicious.  The water does taste a little funny here.  The lady next to me ordered a shockingly expensive premium margarita that seemed to be mostly water.  You can't get out the door for much less than $20 per person.  In other words, it's about what you'd expect.  To his credit, my waiter was working hard and trying to make the best of a bad situation.  I wouldn't want his job.  Whatever.  At least I got home eventually.  The food here may be terrible, the prices high, and the atmosphere depressing. But I'm sure I'll be back some day and so will you.  The good news is that CLT has free wifi, so at least you are able to check the YELP reviews and know what you are getting into.",

It's not bad Mexican, just a little pricey.   The reason for the one star review is that as I am completing my expense report realized someone added their own tip to my bill. My bill was $24.87, which I paid with my corporate card and left a $5 cash tip. As I am completing my expense report, what's shown as being charged to my CC card is $29.87, so clearly someone gave themselves another $5 tip on top of the cash I left. This is unacceptable and theft. Guess I won't be eating here again.",

The place was thinning out, but I couldn't fine one clean table. 10-15 tables with dirty dishes, dirty glasses, empty chip baskets. No manager in sight and no waiters in an hurry to clear a table. I found one corner to sit down squeezed next to another couple. I finally decided if it's this dirty in the restaurant, no telling what the kitchen looks like. Not going to stick around to find out. I don't like giving bad reviews, but this place was ridiculous!",

Golf in Mexico seems a bit more appropriate. My boyfriend said \"well you're lucky the food & drinks are great then\". The bartender replied \"why am I lucky?\"  Well, because we're assuming tips matter to you/our $100 tab means something to the owner.  The bartender hurried us, was very sarcastic, unaccomodating, and clearly didn't care whether we stayed or left.  So we finished up our meals & had more drinks elsewhere.  This is the first time I've ever left a 10% tip, which in all honesty was more than he deserved with his sarcastic/unprofessional service.",

Served with a small pot of salsa, a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole, it was only for the bottle of Cholula on the table that kept it from being tasteless.  I had a Corona with it and there is something seriously wrong with paying $6.79 for a bottle of Corona. Even at airport prices, that's simply absurd.  Service was good and I was not rushed. If you have a decent layover and a craving for bland Mexican, here's Tequileria. Though the burger joint in C is excellent and the wine place in the atrium is also excellent.",

And because they have a captive audience, this isn't about caring or doing right by their customers.  The place is dirty, the drinks are weak, the chips are greasy, and they are horrendously understaffed.  In a locale where people are CLEARLY on the move, service couldn't be any slower.  I sat at a table and when 10 minutes went by without any service at all, I moved to the bar.  Waited another 10 minutes and finally got helped.  Imagine the revenue an airport restaurant would do if they actually served a better than average product, at a FAIR price AND cared about great customer service!",

The tables were clean, and the server was extremely pleasant and attentive, but the food was really not the bee's knees. We had chips and salsa, with the salsa tasting pretty much like Pace (not my fave), and a triple side of quac (since the order is actually quite small our server was kind enough to combine three orders into a larger bowl). The guac was pretty flavorless, and we heard the same from our buddies that ordered the quesadilla.   They did have Tecate though, and limes, and again our waiter was great and the bill wasn't a total punch in the gut since we didn't order that much. I would say if you're in a South of the Border state-of-mind at the Charlotte airport, a Tecate at Tequileria will do you right, but maybe try and spice up the food with some lime juice and/or an unmarked vile of house blended spices (like the one my mom gives me and expects me to carry around to season my food).",

    "text": "We've been here many times and are sad to say it has consistently gone downhill over the years. Because of it's location, we've endured its lackluster service, but this past visit is the straw that broke the traveller's back.  Empty glasses and half-filled plates littered the length of the bar and the abundance of fruit flies almost drove us away before we ordered, but we decided to stick it out as it has been our go-to in CLT.  We now wish we had gone somewhere else.  The kitchen got my wife's salad order wrong twice (she was a trooper and decided to eat around the unwanted ingredients because we were short on time and didn't want to wait for a third re-make) and it took us flagging Pat (our bartender) down for every drink to stay quenched.   We overheard a couple of servers talking about how they were perpetually understaffed and while we understand that, we've been to enough airports, bars, and restaurants around the world to believe that should never reflect in the service the guests experience.  Bottom line, we're headed back through CLT next week and will be drinking/eating somewhere else.",

The options are limited so food should come out in a decent time. Ours came out in a reasonable time so no complaints there. Lastly onto the important part, being the food and how it tastes. You can't expect gourmet Mexican in an airport but it was decent. I've had better Mexican food but also had worse so it's middle of the road here. Using more seasoning would go a long way here. For the price I wish it was better but that's airline restaurants for you. You can likely find cheaper options in the airport. I would recommend this to those looking for Mexican food if you have over and hour and a half layover. Otherwise you may miss your flight.",

It was supposed to come with sour cream and cheese and after a thorough check I found no sour cream so i I asked for some on the side - forget the cheese! I'm not sure why the rice was undercooked but that in itself was enough to ruin the meal.

    "text": "I should have known better than to eat mexican food in a north Carolina restaurant. It was soooo bland! The guac was bland and watery. Same for chicken tacos which fell apart because they only use one per taco (for stewed meats you should almost always use two).   The worst part is they put cilantro on EVERYTHING! I dont have a problem with it except for the fact that it was clearly old. Cilantro is so cheap there is NO excuse for using old cilantro. Maybe I am being harsh but I take my tacos pretty seriously.   The bright spot is that they have lots of TV's and friendly staff.",

    "text": "I have to agree with a previous poster, Tequileria was somewhere between yuck and I hope I can hold this down.    I ordered the chicken enchiladas and, while I was eating in an airport and  wasn't expecting gourmet food, I did want something with some flavor.  Somehow this food lacked all flavor and the consistency was just blah!  I added hot sauce and more hot sauce but finally gave up.   How can you prepare totally flavorless Mexican food?  The service was just too damn slow!  Again, in an airport folks are generally trying to eat and head to their flight not stay and enjoy the fine experience.  We first pushed our plates away hoping this would be a signal...nope.  Then we stacked our silverware and used napkins on our plates.  Nope, nothing, I think we could have lit the napkins on fire and he wouldn't have noticed.  Then, after flagging down the waiter for our check, two tables of attractive female guests were seated thus causing him a delay of oh, about another 20 minutes.  We, then had to flag him down again.  My girl friend ordered the chicken wings and they were actually not bad.   In summary, save your time and money.",

The eggs come scrambled with some cheese crumbles on top and they also give you a side of salsa. It's pretty filling and not too pricey considering it's a crab cake at airport prices.

Firstly, the salad took forever...Almost twenty minutes in the \"Quick To-Go\" area dubbed as \"Pronto\" service.    The only thing that I asked for extra is for them to add grilled chicken to the salad.    Once I got to the gate, I was expecting this crisp and refreshing Jicama and nice luscious lettuce blend with some tomatoes and cheese.  But instead, I found myself some shredded iceberg lettuce that looks like its used to top their tacos and several strips of Jicama and some diced tomatoes and shredded cheese.  That is it!  So very bland and the chicken was paper thin to say the very least.  BleAahhHHh...  On top of that, I got to my gate and realized there wasn't even dressing in the bag...so I sucked it up and just ate it because I already bought it and was hungry and there was no turning back to get dressing (which in the description, it was tossed in).

Know that they'll always be crowded during peak travel times and usually understaffed so the bartenders especially will be running around like crazy and they're actually quite good yet people will still be complaining about service.  That being said, the house margaritas are very good - and large - and as far as airports go the price isn't too bad for a top shelf margarita that basically fills the glass twice.  On the food side, the crab cake sandwich was excellent with a fresh jicama slaw on top and I got it with chips & guacamole which were pretty good.  On a second visit I ordered tacos immediately upon sitting down which never came in the 45 minutes I was at the bar but it was a Thursday evening and the place was packed and the bartender took it off my bill so not a huge deal.  If I was starving I would have asked about it every 5 minutes but everyone was running around like crazy so I didn't bother them.  There are a few decent places in the central area of the Charlotte airport, but I would definitely come back here again and appreciate the large number of bar seats that are available.

Bossing around your customers before they even have their A$$ in the seat is not a good way to start out the relationship.  The encounter ended with the other bartender, who was taking care of us and seemed a little nicer, trying to pass off someone else's check to us.  It was no accident either as he freely told us that he gave our check to the guy who had been next to me and that this one was basically the same thing (we had 4 beers and this was a couple of drinks and some food).  Having worked in bars and restaurants for some time I knew this was totally shady and instead he give me one for what I had had.  Lo and behold when he did as asked the check was $3-$4 cheaper than the one he was trying to get me to cover.  I can guarantee you this money would have been more likely to end up in the bartenders pockets and not the till had I just complied and paid it.  And for the record, 4 Sam Adams drafts should not total $38 before the tip unless your in an NYC club or something of the like!  Overall a very underwhelming experience!",

They filled a large plate with chopped up romaine, tomatillo slices, diced tomatoes, jalapeno pieces and slivers of mango. The dressing was decent but the salad looked like a taco topping but tons of it. We also got two tacos that were good but nothing spectacular. The order of nachos was big but it had too many pieces of jalapeno. You could probably split it three ways as an app but the two if us polished it off. I ate about half of the salad and it still looked untouched.",

The verde sauce and sour cream were plentiful, the rice flavorful, and the black beans were a nice change from typical refried beans.  They recently pared down the menu but the chicken enchiladas are still offered.  I have tried this dish 3 times since the change and each time is equally awful.  What the heck is going on???  I have to order extra verde sauce and sour cream because all that is given now is a scant squirt of each.  The rice is now a very bland white rice with some green specks of maybe parsley?  Black beans are now replaced with refried beans that are as equally bland as the rice.  Three times is enough.  I am sorry to scratch this one off the list.  I predict that this restaurant will close in the near future.",

    "text": "Why? Why do I do it?   Probably because I just got off a six hour flight and when presented with a giant sign for a \"Tequileria\" my brain got the veto from my nerves.   While I don't necessarily regret it, I ordered a house rocks margarita a and was presented with a martini glass full, plus an extra shaker. Somehow I knew this little extra on the side was not a great value, but was going to set me back. ($13.50, to be exact). It did, however hit the spot.   The food however? I deeply regret. Dollar taco quality. I have absolutely no qualms spending $12 on a couple of tacos, but they'd better be the kind of tacos I want to rave about. These just motivated me to write a two star review even before I board my plane. Iceberg lettuce, ingredients that taste fresh from the can, and flimsy tortillas that rival only the packing material they use between dinner plates.  Consider this a public service announcement. I'd feel guilty if I didn't at the very least try to help people avoid this place - no amount of stress or hunger is worth it. Seriously - I'd rather you grab a Cinnabon.",

I had also overheard the next table discussing their exorbitant drink prices so I asked them about it. One had ordered the same thing I did and another the house red wine. The wine was $23. I asked to speak to the manager who told that was the correct price. After all, the drinks are made with Grand Marnier and Reposada. Those ingredients are in the ultimate margarita but we didn't order that. I told her it was outrageous and she said that was the right price at THIS airport. I paid, tipped and left. As you can see from the menu, we were not served what we ordered and management is robbing their customers.",

This one was slightly more tolerable but I still regretted the decision to drop in this place.

Of course it took a million years to finally get my meal. After 15 minutes the server ran back to the kitchen and told them they had to prepare my food hay es hay p. I guess they totally forgot my order. I got it and ran. well, after running with my to-go box the pollo enchiladas, rice and beans ended up sloshing everyone and dripped all over my bag. Nice. Too bad it was such a crummy experience. Because the pollo was well seasoned and tasty. The beans had serious spice and zip to them. The rice was tasteless but has a hint of cilantro a la chipotle style. Most people complain about the charge for chips and salsa. The server tells me its because it's all made in house. Well, I believe it. the food here tastes good. And the dining room is always packed. Just cannot rely on the kitchen. In the airport I really need a more reliable food spot. Grr.",

Especially after this heartwarming encounter:    The bartender - a young woman with extensive tattoos on her arms and short black and blonde ponytails - picked a fight with a customer who's server had forgotten him and his wife in the back of the restaurant.   Mr Customer tried to politely ask for his check, explaining the situation and the bartender defiantly stated that she could not help him and that he needed to pay at his table where his server had forgotten them for some time.  Mr customer very patiently restated his quandary after which he bartender, without a word, stormed off into the back of the restaurant. Upon returning; she didn't even look at mr customer and proceeded to go take a drink order from another customer at the bar (this all happened on 11/29/2014 between 515pm -530pm).  Mr customer ended up getting his bill and signing from some other employee at the bar.  My experience was fine until the check was requested with one last beer. The Same bartender as above sat laughing with another bartender, preparing several other drinks in glasses, and doing something else right in front of me for about five minutes before she finally remembered to crack a top off a beer put it in front of me and hit a button that printed my receipt all in under 10 seconds.   Way to go to pay attention to your customers.",

I wanted to avoid meat here so we just got a cheese quesadilla, which was fine but took forever to come out (even though it's literally just cheese and a tortilla). Overall I would not eat here again and the food did give me bad heartburn just from how greasy everything was.

But it's a nice alternative to Burger King. They have express versions of what they sell in the sit down restaurant next door. And they have a bunch of grab and go items like salads, sandwiches, fruit bowls, etc.   Several choices of meat for your tacos or salad, and the softest flour tortillas I've had in ages. Not spicy but plenty of flavor in the beef. The service was again pretty typical of airport dining, but the turnaround was fairly quick...and in an airport that's priceless.   Overall a good solid choice for a quick meal during your layover.",

By the time I got my food I had to ask for it to go, which honestly in an airport setting isn't the worst situation but had Ciera ever (I mean ever) checked in with me i would have asked for it to go straight away but i never saw her after she dropped off my water and took my order.

I didn't have long and was recommended the chips and queso over my other choice of a tortilla soup. I enjoyed the chips and salsa but the queso didn't taste much like cheese or anything. Eventually mixed half the salsa into the queso and hot sauce from the counter and it was still a bit weird/bland.  Had a corona and had to ask the bartender to give a glass of water.

I'm generally not one to pass up on Mexican, but I was a bit skeptical about full service Mexican in an airport.   First of all, this place is a lot bigger inside than it looks like on the outside.  There are two points of entry, along with a quick-order counter for some pre-made selections.  The place is colorfully decorated, has several televisions broadcasting sports and local news, and plays music loudly.  VERY loudly.  It took a few minutes, but by the time our server arrived we were ready to order.  My wife got the fish tacos, I ordered the Roasted Pork Shoulder Chimichanga.  Food delivery time was about 15 minutes and the food was delivered accurate and hot.  As in \"don't touch the plate\" hot.  And the chimichanga was OUTSTANDINGLY delicious.  I noticed that the beans had a distinct taste to them that I really liked, but our server said I was the first person to ever say that.  I don't recall our server's name, but she was personable, attentive, helpful and (most importantly) right on time with our drink refills.  For being an airport eatery with a near-constant influx of travelers, I was pleasantly surprised and actually impressed with this visit.  Should we get to the Charlotte airport again this is where we'll be eating.",

    "text": "Big mistake!!  Big, Huge!!   I regret going to Tequileria Pronto :(  On the outside it looks like a good restaurant to dine in and they also offer a quick to go counter.  I usually don't complain about prices while traveling, but I ordered a Barbacoa burrito that cost $19.47 and it tasted horrible!  Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life and I love Barbacoa.    I ordered from the to go counter, which took about 10-15 minutes and I was pressed for time, which I shouldn't have even risked getting some food on my short layover, so kinda my own fault.  The lady working was very nice and gave me a fork with extra napkins.  I was expecting the burrito to come wrapped up in foil, like all the burritos I get in Cali, but nope!  This burrito came cut in half and placed in a square Styrofoam container, which is not travel friendly.  I was going to eat it in the plane later, changed my mind and tried to eat some of it before we boarded.  The beef meat was very dry, the rice was gross, and the flavor was lack less...  there was a little side of salsa with it that I didn't even open.  After a couple bites, I ended up throwing the whole thing in the garbage, yep I threw away $20 that fast!!!  I highly recommend not to go here for the food, maybe just for the margarita's to get drunk.  There are other places in the food atrium that are much better choices for a quick bite to eat.  I saw Chick Fil A, Burger King, Sbarro's, Cinnabon, Bad Daddy's burger bar, Bojangles' Famous chicken n biscuits, and more ...  Never again :(",

Was not expecting a lot since these airport bars tend to charge high prices for very -average- food, but was pleasantly surprised. The Mexican salad with pulled chicken, beans, salsa and chipotle dressing was surprising good! Also ordered a beer and it was under $10 which didn't make me feel totally gouged.  If they had a bit larger of a selection (or if the servers were a bit more friendly) could probably be 5 stars.",

Seriously, the food court here is large but super packed, so having a restaurant with a large private seating area is a blessing.  The service and pricing were not bad for an airport.  My son has milk and egg allergies so we ordered him carnitas tacos (no cheese, or anything, just meat). They came out super fast and my son at 10 months old chowed down on the meat non-stop. They were also pretty large. Obviously, I had one since my son can't finish them all and I was expecting a lot considering the taste of the tasty meat.  The nachos were awesome we ordered, huge, I should have just had that as my meal...  Unfortunately, my wife Enchiladas and my Chimichanga were the definition of super bland... I realize I am in Charlotte, NC..., I realize this is a gringo style latino joint... However, after having such tasty carnitas meat on a taco, I thought it might be legit. Unfortunately, the vanilla taste of our entrees made us sad.  Next time we fly through, we'll stop for tacos and nachos... we'll skip the entrees...",

    "text": "I usually don't review food and drink places at airports because it's common knowledge that airport prices are always jacked up for a mediocre return. However, this is a deserving post.  I walked in and picked a table on my own at 1:30pm on a Monday, and the restaurant was only half-full. It took a few minutes for a waitress to arrive, which is typical for every restaurant I've visited in an airport. I also took a spot in the far back for privacy. This place has a huge section upfront with the bar, but also a quieter section in the back.  This experience was unique from my past travels because my waitress, Cassie, worked hard and fast for me. I wasn't even in a hurry, and she was running around attending to everyone as quickly as possible, but not rushing anyone. You could tell it was her mission to make everyone happy and she kept a friendly smile and attitude the entire time. Usually you have to flag people down at airports, but she stayed on top of things and I never had to wait longer than expected. You can bet she received an extra large tip. She made me feel like she was my personal assistant and said I could stay as long as needed.  I ordered the chips and salsa, which were $4.99, and the salsa was good. My chips came out hot from the oven, which is rare, but awesome! It's annoying to pay for chips and salsa, but I guess they don't want people sitting there eating free chips and salsa and not ordering anything else. Maybe make it free chips and salsa if you order a meal?  I also ordered the chopped taco salad. It was nothing special, I was just craving Mexican food. It didn't taste like a Mexican taco salad, but the chips and salsa healed my craving.   I didn't order alcohol since I was recovering from the weekend visiting friends, but drank 3 glasses of water that never went empty before refilled!  If you are craving Mexican food, give it a try. It's the only sit-down Mexican restaurant I saw between B and C terminals plus it was nice to sit in a comfy booth versus the gate during a layover. I wouldn't visit this place if it was a restaurant outside of the airport, but it's ok for airport food. The other reviews made me laugh because, again, airports always have higher prices on goods which are usually average at best. Set your expectations accordingly. If this restaurant was located outside of the airport, the review would have been totally different. Normal restaurants versus airport restaurants have different expectations, use common sense. :)",

It was a go to place as soon as well landed, however the service was quite slow, and the food was not exactly what I had intended.  Chorizo sausage breakfast 2/5  I was expecting an actual chorizo sausage with my eggs, but rather it was all cut up and mixed with onions, and other spices... hmmm....  My gramps and brother had their typical GRINGO breakfast, bacons, eggs, toast, etc... nothing that WOW'ed me.  Mom had their jalapeno eggs with bacon, again same score 2/5......  will i be back? nope, but if I ever land in the same aiport, ill be sure to try elsewhere.",

Since this place is located at the airport, drinks are, as expected, pricy, so I didn't  order anything alcoholic, , as I might normally do...or stay for another round, as I might normally do. But if you have time to kill, and don't care about the food, it is a nice enough place.",

I said I was not made aware and she smirked. It's that how your staff treats people. Then I can tell you travelling every week, I will tell everyone in my company not to come here. Apparently, she is more worried about cleaning than paying customers, tell me how cleaning pays the bar again??? That's what I thought: nothing.

I was told it usually takes 20 min or so.  Alright then, we waited another 10 min.... I say \"excuse me sir to another bartender\" his response... lifts his pointer finger at me and says \"one second!\" I don't even do that to my 8 year old students!

I pretty much dislike all things Cuervo and, unfortunately, almost the entire tequila menu was varying forms of Cuervo.  I sucked it up and just dealt with it like a good traveling princess should.    The margarita was okay but nothing special.  The lady had a glass of wine and we split chips and salsa.    We waited around for the waiter to take note we'd finished for probably 10 minutes.  Not a huge deal normally, but when your patrons run the risk of missing flights, service should come before joking around with your co-workers.    The total bill was around $30.. ouch!  Yes I know, I know... it's the airport.  It's supposed to be over-priced, but considering the lack of service and poor tequila selection (at a place that has \"tequila\" in the name no less) I was pretty well disappointed.",

Unfortunately, since I was traveling on Army orders to a class, and would have to take a physical fitness test in a few days, I had to hold back from the liquor.    It was crowded in there, but the bartender greeted us immediately and invited us to sit there. Had it not been so close to the walkway/entrance, we might have taken him up on the offer since it was right in front of the TV that was playing the basketball game.  Luckily, we found a table more toward the inside of the restaurant so we could get some personal space.    My buddy and I both ordered the enchiladas.  I was ok with the plastic utensils, but when the food tasted like cafeteria style quality, I felt it was way overpriced, even considering it being in an airport.  The black beans and rice were just ok.  Next time, I'll just come here for the drinks when I want to get smashed for my next flight.",

However, I noticed they had some authentic looking items on the menu, like tamales, carnitas, and enchilada suiza.    I ordered the jicama salad and had shrimp added.  It was quite good, and I've never seen such large chunks of jicama in my dish before!  There were jicama bricks in there!  Still, I managed to slice them and eat them during my long layover, and I was quite pleased.  Other items in the salad were shredded lettuce, tomatoes and large pieces of cucumber and 8 medium sized shrimp.    I would go back now and try something more hearty now that the salad was up to par.",

    "text": "Potentially, Tequileria deserves ZERO stars... Trapped in the airport for 10 hours, my girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. We were able to find a table quickly: Things pretty much went downhill from there...  The waitress asked if we'd like to start with a drink? Hell, why not? \"I'll take a beer and my girlfriend would like a glass of white wine.\" \"Six or nine ounces,\" she asked. \"Nine is fine,\" said my girlfriend. We ordered chicken tacos; three each. Drinks arrived quickly followed in mere moments by the food. Chicken tacos were tasteless, very light on the filling, dressing thin and watery. Any self respecting person of Mexican decent would have left at that point but we decided to eat them as we were hungry and had time to kill. Even cardboard has nutritional value, right? Then came the bill: Taco chicken: Mexican way (NOT!) x 2, 1 x draught Stella, 1 x a bottle of Pino Grigio... Wait a minute, we didn't order a bottle of wine! SIXTY THREE Dollars!!! Turns out that one 9 ounce glass of wine was $22.75. Say what? Sorry, it was $62 for a bottle. And that for a Pino you can pick up at the supermarket for $8.  Now, I have traveled the world extensively, from New York to London, to Tokyo but NEVER, and I mean NEVER, had I paid $23 for a GLASS of wine, anywhere. Until now. I felt like we had been mugged in broad daylight. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Except the tacos because they had none... So in closing, I would suggest you give this place a miss; unless you're desperate for less than mediocre food and extortionate alcohol prices in which case this will be right in your wheelhouse.",

That was not the case - this is a regular Mexican restaurant with slightly extended tequila list, mostly Jose Cuervo ( I ended up drinking Corona).  Food was good - had chicken gumbo soup and chimichurri burger. I would've like more chimichurri sauce on my burger, but that would be the only complaint. Little side of chopped jalapeno/tomato/sweet onion mix was outright delicious (had to ask for a second).  Service was prompt and friendly.  Recommended.",

It was crowded at the front of the restaurant. We were about to jump into some seats at the bar when I noticed an almost empty seating area in the back. It was dark. No atmosphere other than \"rushed\". Nothing interesting other than a large Evian bottle, unopened, on every table. EVERY table. When we asked our waitress why they were there she said, \"they are there for a promotion.\" She told us they often slip off the rounded edge of the table. Later, during our meal, we heard a thud behind us. A man (who looked a little like Putin) was picking his Evian bottle off the floor.  We didn't ask if we could drink it or take it and the waitress never offered it to us. Strange.   Steve and I decided to split the carnitas tacos. We had a choice between having our tacos made \"the Mexican way or the American way\". The American way was made with sour cream and cheese. The Mexican way had pico de gallo , cilantro and onions. We opted for Mexican. Duh.  The tacos were very good. The carnitas was excellent and the toppings were fresh. We were pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this bite to eat before continuing our trip to NOLA.  I also had the mango Margarita. It was okay. Plenty of Jose Cuervo and real mango puree but it was super cold and just okay. I think it was just   sticky sweetness overkill. The glass was meh.   The service was good. Our server, Keisha, was very pleasant and helpful.   I would recommend this place. It was also the only real GF option I had....since I did not want sushi or salad.

    "text": "Airport Mexican  Located right on the main hub of Charlotte-Douglas airport, Tequileria is convenient to all the terminals.  This is a great place to meet other travelers in your party or to kill some time before heading down to your final gate area.  Tequileria is large- there are plenty of seats at the bar and tables available.  I hit the bar area typically as it is just me that normally travels. Bar is nothing special, but they do have hooks mounted underneath so you can hang your backpack or small items down by your knees while eating; nice touch there.  There is a decent beer selection considering it is in an airport - but this is not a microbrew kind of place, so set your expectations accordingly.  Menu is a little convoluted: they serve breakfast and Mexican-ish foods.  There are burritos and tacos and you have a variety of preparation \"ways\" for example: choose your meat type, then the \"finishing\" which consists of a few nationalities such as Mexican which gives you some pico de gallo, or American which slathers on the crema (because, you know, we are all fat bastards in this country), and choice of shells, which is nice on paper.  The 3-taco meal with carnitas (pork) is the way I went with soft corn tortillas.   Took a little time to get it out of the kitchen, so I had high hopes but all that went out the window as soon as it tried to pick up my taco- all the water from the pico de gallo dripped through and turned it into a mushy mess.  Too bad as the pork was pretty good and the taco could have been a win.  Chips and salsa, not complimentary, were at least crunchy but on the greasy side- totally expected.  Guacamole is canned - again, expected.  Bartender was nice enough and she didn't try ramming beers down my throat so a point for that.  All in all a good place to get some drinks, and **very** basic Mexican type foods - I think I would just stick with the greasy chips personally and risk the shits on the plane - you decide.",

It was weak, lacked flavor and character and did not deserve to be called a margarita.   The tacos were a disgrace to mexican food everywhere. I don't even know where to begin. I thought they served me a salad initially. I couldn't see any shell or meat under mountainous servings of cheese and lettuce. I managed to excavate the shell and meat and eat it only to be dissapointed in both the flavor, texture and general composition of these \"tacos\". I paid another 15$ for a bag of cheese and lettuce dumped onto a plate.   The best part of my meal was the lone french fry I encountered while painfully digging through lettuce and cheese. It was pretty good.",

The reviews are fairly valid... but for one, this IS an airport restaurant so you automatically shouldn't expect what you normally would... and secondly, it doesn't really matter does it? When traveling we gotta eat something... so this place will likely be busy no matter what any of us say! lol I ordered the passion fruit Paloma, outside my norm as I'm usually more a beer, wine or vodka soda kind of girl, but I said  to myself \"what the hell! I have a 2 hour layover\" and went for a cocktail even though I knew this was probably not the place to have such an epiphany. Well I should've known despite the refreshing description sounding semi artisanal, that it wasn't going to be fresh squeezed juices or anything, silly me! However, despite the concentrate juices - the drink wasn't overly sweet! Thank goodness, because as the waitress walked away I immediately regretted ordering it fearing it would be sickly sweet - I hate super sweet cocktails!!! So it was a big plus that it was made well... and I could taste the alcohol! So yay! Hey, I actually feel a buzz right now!  Now for the food, I ordered the veggie quesadilla to uphold my flexitarian ways (avoiding meat but will still eat it when I deem the meal worthy of breaking my semi-commitment). The quesadilla was good! Totally something like what you could throw together at home, nothing mind blowing, but totally tasty and did the job. I like the veggie option because it was corn and beans, with just a little finely chopped bell pepper. I would totally get it again if i was at this terminal. So for that, given the setting and expectations, I'd say it's a 4 Star place as far as airport restaurants go!  Oh yes, the server was very friendly too!!! She was busy, but never was gone too long despite that fact, she got me everything I needed in an appropriate amount of time.",

We intended to stop for drinks and chips and salsa, but went with the chips and guacamole, which were fantastic.  The drinks were tasty and decent strength.  The guacamole was so good we moved on to Tacos - and the tacos were tasty.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the whole micro-meal and cocktails.  This was a fantastic way to spend a layover at Charlotte, NC airport.",

This place is usually nice Mexican and fast service (it's sit yourself). I waited 30 minutes before the server came. I asked for a taco salad with a substitute Dressing for ranch. She told me they didn't have any in a very rude manner. The guy at the next table asked for a quesadilla. 10 mins later he gets his. 20 mins later I asked her for my salad (at this point I'm almost 1 hour there). She didn't come to my table just yelled \"it will get here when it gets here\".  I had had enough and asked for my check for the iced tea. To which she replied \"just leave\".  There was an airport service attendant who observed this and was shaking his head.  I then Asked for the manager who confirmed with the aid and told me he would look into it. He Didn't apologize or offer to serve me food.  I've never seen anything like this especially in Charlotte!",

I'm greeted fairly quickly by a gentleman who seemed pretty new to being wait staff. I tell him I'll have a beer and start off, implying I'll continue my order, with a order of chips and queso. About 5-10 minutes later he brings out the couple next to me two margaritas in shaker cups. He begins shaking and on an up swing he cannot keep a grip on it and showers me and everything within a ten foot radius of me with overpriced tequila. He then looks dumbfounded and starts blaming the bartender and apologizing to the couple. They had to bring attention to the fact that I was drenched. He then proceeded to give me a quick \"Sorry man\" before continuing on. No sort of compensation was made, not even so much as an offer for a free beer or anything. ALSO NO EXTRA TOWELS OR NAPKINS. It took another thirty minutes till I finally told him I wanted to place an order of an actual meal. The burrito sucked. Gas station burrito quality. After everything I couldn't bring myself not to tip. I left a ten percent tip and proceeded to report this to the manager on duty who seemed more apathetic than anyone else. If I'm ever unfortunate enough to be stuck in CLT for three hours again I will call an uber to a chipotle outside the airport.   The queso was good though.",

Instead of spicy ground beef in crunchy hot curved tortillas, these are basically dry Carolina barbeque beef in a soft corn tortilla which falls apart after the first bite.  So, then you have salad with no wrapper which you have to eat with a fork.  House margaritas taste like Gatorade and there are no free chips and salsa (which I don't mind paying for; but, when you eat alone a big $5 bowl of chips and salsa makes no sense).  Lesson learned - connect through DFW if you want some real tacos.",

I asked if they had Mojitos, she told me No and never took any alternate drink order (if she'd bothered to come to the table maybe she could have given me other options).  Fish tacos were so-so, I didn't finish them.  Everything seemed to come from a can.  Bland, and mushy.   Service was pretty uninspired and not very quick.  Walk a little further or stop at the burger place in the airport.  Charlotte airport has so many other options.  Our meal was over $50 for 2 fish tacos, a burrito, and a margarita.  Considering the quality, they should be ashamed.",

    "text": "In a word - disgusting. Had to request new silverware because my initial set contained chunks (not bits, chunks) of crusted food. The tapwater had a strange metallic taste that not even fresh lime could mask. Final disappointment: North Carolina's recently updated laws that prohibit restaurants from serving undercooked meat. Had I known this before ordering, I would have ordered something else, but the server neglected to let me know. I was not pleased when the burger I requested \"medium-rare\" came out well-done and flavorless.  The sides are microscopic. For $1.99 you can get 2 tablespoons of \"guacamole\" (it definitely isn't the kind that's made of freshly mashed avocado).  Also, they'd ran out of mango for their margaritas by 12PM on a Sunday. That's unnacceptable, even at a high-traffic location like this.  Should've gone to Uno's.",
