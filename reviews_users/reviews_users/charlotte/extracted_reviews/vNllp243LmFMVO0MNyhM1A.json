About 40% of the place was Steelers fans and another 40% Packers fans, but we were able to get a TV switched to the Washington game (first come, first serve on TVs). I got the Ranch Hand (burger) and it was delicious. A few of the other customers were rude to us about the game. That put a damper on the overall experience, but I know it's not the restaurant's fault.",

Nothing extravagant, but all of them have great flavor, and a good sized portion to them.   The wait staff is hit or miss lately... It's ranged from phenomenal service to very sub-par performance.

I'm also not sure I would call them Mile High Nachos but that could be because we got the chips on the side.  Overall though the food itself was good.  My burger had a ton of flavor.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their tacos, and panini.  Good place to watch a game and get some food or for lunch.  I'd prob go back.",

Apparently after we ordered our food it took longer than normal because she said for some reason the order did no go through the computer and she took our meals off of our ticket without us even asking or complaining.

    "text": "We visited this location with a group early one Saturday night. After reading the more recent reviews we were reluctant to eat here but this is where the group was meeting so we didn't have a choice. Well we should have went with our gut. This was our 2nd visit to this location. The first visit was just for drinks late one Saturday night approx 3 months prior to the last visit. At that time it was very clean, we had good service and more importantly good drinks and food. This time we found this place to be very disorganized, dirty, bad service, bad drinks and just okay food. Walking in there was no one at the hostess station as we waited there for about ten minutes we had to go in and ask for someone. When we were seated we were next to 2 large tables of about 12 people each which were leaving. It took another 10 minutes for a waitress to show up to take our drink order and then another 15 minutes for our iced down drinks that the whole table said that they didn't think there was any alcohol in our drinks. Again this was a Saturday night and it was dead. The 2 tables of 12 people that left were left dirty with dishes and glasses for over 3 hours as we sat there. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. The only reason for 2 stars is the food was the only fair thing about this place even though half the table said their food was delivered cold. Needless to say we will not be back unless we see an \"Under New Management\" sign. A couple words for this location as a previous owner of a small Restaraunt. Clean House! Fire current management! Can someone say it's time for John Taffer before it's too late!!!",

    "text": "I'd say more like 3 1/2 stars would be accurate.  I wanted to watch my NY Football Giants on Monday at a bar, so I convinced my brother-in-law to meet me here as I thought it was 1/2 way between our respective homes.  It was not, 25 min trip for me, 15 for him.  No big deal, my sisters ended up joining us too for a little while, and us girls split 20 wings since they were $.45 each on Monday nights.  You can order them in any denominaton, the server said you could get 2 if you wanted, that's weird I would never order 2 wings.  They were decent, but they were fried and I haven't had wings that were deep fried in a while and I prefer them to be grilled or smoked now.  Our server was pretty good for the majority of the night, but for the end of the 3rd quarter and most of the 4th she was no where to be seen.  And all I wanted as I nervously watched the game start to change, was one more delicious Guiness!!  She finally came around and I got my drink, but still, nobody likes to be kept waiting so long for beer.  A while after my sisters had left and my BIL devoured his own order of wings, we got some more food.  He went with nachos, I went with the Black Forest sandwich, with no bacon or ham.  But I think they left off the cheese too, no big deal.  The pretzel roll was soooo good, it was soft and warm.  I could have ate it on its own, but the turkey, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard were all great on it.  I opted for no side as I wasn't really that hungry, so the sandwich alone hit the spot.  Overall, besides the Cowboys fans that I was ready to jump after the beginning of the game, it was a solid option for a sports bar.  Plenty of TVs, good bar food, reasonable prices and plenty of drink specials daily.  I've been to the University and Uptown locations as well, and they seem to be pretty standard all around.",

That was the only good thing about the visit. The rest of the appetizer was average. I ordered the chicken Capri sandwich and found it very bland (what basil pesto?). In fact, I didn't even eat half of the sandwich. And the cheese on sweet potato fries was just weird. The service was AWFUL. We waited 15 minutes before the waitress took our drink order and that was pretty consistent throughout the meal. Even paying the bill was a hassle...she never asked us how we wanted to do the bill, so she spent 20 minutes fixing it. Then after we paid, she took another 20 minutes to come back with receipts or change. Also, I know it's a sports bar type restaurant, however, you don't need to turn up the volume so incredibly loud that I can't hear the person sitting directly beside me. I would definitely not go back.",

I wonder how other cities would handle this situation... would they allow other games on their huge jumbo tron tv with anything but the home team?!?  There have been about 15 people begging them to change it... they won't. They will not even come out of the office. This is unacceptable and I can't believe they are so stubborn.  Don't come here if you're a panthers fan!!!  They don't care.  I will follow the Seattle group and also move to a different bar!",

The restaurant is usually half empty when we go in which is usually a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Now that is in way a bad thing. We get better service, faster food, and like I said better game day viewing. They also have huge booths which are great for large parties or a typical family with kids.  I have to say I can't review the menu because the only thing I ever get is the Black Forest sandwich and fries. I love, love, love that sandwich. I never get anything else. You just can't go wrong with a pretzel bread sandwich.",

I walked in to a bar the had some of Ballantyne's finest here if you know what I mean.  I sat at the bar and the server took my drink order and asked if I wanted food.  I let him know that I was all set.  A few minutes later he asks me again.  No big deal.  Shortly after that again he ask me. I was like what the F??  I didn't know if he was trying to pad my check.  But I already ordered my second drink so it wasn't like I was just sitting at the bar not ordering anything.  What really upset me was that I went to play Golden Tee(IO had to kill an hour and a half).  I tried to get another drink.  He just walked by me 5 or 6 times and ignored me.  THEN...serves the two people on each side of me and continue to walks by again.  It might have been the rudest person I have ever dealt with at a bar.  On the good side of things.  The bar is a nice set up.  A lot of tv's.  Good set up of table.  They also have pool tables.  But that is it.",

It's located in the strip mall with the Harris Teeter, which offers patrons a bunch of alternatives to wander off too before or after the visit.  They do have some drink specials which are utilized by plenty of folks who work around the location, so there is usually a manageable sized crowd.  The BBQ flat bread pizza I had was tasty, actually, I would order it again.  The atmosphere is okay, pretty generic really.  The problem I have, and the reason for the low rated review, was with the service.  The gal who waited on me was visably sick.  I mean, c'mon management.  If one of your staff, who is GOING TO HANDLE FOOD, is obviously, visably, noticeably sick - SEND THEM HOME.  Long story short, I got sick the next day, same symptoms as the waiter who served us.  Completely unacceptable.    Too bad really, because the food was decent for what it was, but I can't justify the experience now that I have to deal with this illness.",

    "text": "We have been going to this place for years. I was hesitant to continue because the last couple times it smelled like someone mopped with a sour mop. It still stinks. We were hungry so. We stayed. There was one other table occupied besides ours. It was 5:45 and this surprised me because they have $5 Grey goose martinis among other drink specials.  I ordered a dirty martini and water. I was brought a regular Martini. Whatever. Then we ordered. I ordered voodoo chicken with no bun and my husband ordered skirt steak tacos.  No where on the menu did it say the tacos were spicy. He does not eat spicy food, but I do. When our Oder came out, his taco \"skirt steak\" looked like the meat you get in those cheap Mexican dinners and it was so spicy it made MY eyes water (I can handle spicy, but this was ridiculous). The salsa that came with the tacos was really spicy, too. The chips would've been good if they hadn't had the equivalent of a salt lick on them. I started eating my voodoo chicken, but it wasn't chicken. It was a burger.  It had so much crap piled on it I didn't even know it wasn't chicken until I dug it out. I had to trade with my husband because he couldn't even eat his tacos. I think he saved me because he was sick from that night till the next day. They also had the music blaring so loud you couldn't even hear each other.  The ladies behind me asked for it to be turned down, but when the next shift manager came in he cranked it right back up and proceeded to walk around singing. No thanks. They have totally changed and shortened the menu in what I think is an attempt to save the restaurant. No way will it last. If you can't pack the place with the happy hour drink specials they have, your fate is sealed.  Waitress was fine but chatty except for messing up my drink and meal orders.",

The ladies restroom was dirty and there were puddles of water (I hope) on the floor. There was a game on and the bar was busy. The bar had no wine glasses and my wine was served in a dirty water glass. I tried to speak with our server about it but she dropped it and bolted. I was looking forward to my order selection or i would have left. I ordered the dilemma chicken sandwich and i must say - it was good!  The Brussels were a little soggy but still tasty. The fish and chips were sad; they used to be large hand breaded and delish. Now they seem like the Gordon's Fisherman delivered them from the frozen food section of the Harris Teeter. Our server informed us that she was training so she and her trainer would be visiting. Ok - no worries, everyone learns sometime. Yet we didn't see either server for the majority of our meal. She returned once but only because we made eye contact. The chicken sandwich was good, sadly not worth the hassle and gross bathroom.",

I decided not to try again since it wasn't ever going to be corrected. We had some queso which seemed ok but was probably dumped from a jar and dropped into the mini cast iron pan. I ordered a bbq pizza, which was terrible. The chicken was unevenly cooked. The pizza was burnt and SO salty. Seriously, how do you make a pizza so salty???? My friend ordered wings but they came out in the wrong flavor. We had an order of pretzels, which were so so. If we just had beer and pretzels then we would have been fine, overall.

The drinks took forever to serve and when mine didn't come out, (an easy draft to pour), I inquired.  She said the bartender at the bar was busy, but there wasn't many people sitting at the bar and the place wasn't that packed.  (she forgot and didn't want to fess up to it). When I expressed my unsatisfaction,, she just said sorry and didn't even act like I was a big deal.  I advised I didn't want to order food if it was going to take that long to get a drink alone, asked for my check, paid, and left.",

Unfortunately, my wife has a bad back and the bar chairs where built to dangle ones feet.   We asked to wait for a booth in the dinning section and where informed by the hostess reluctantly that \"people are eating and stuff.\" Go figure.  Well, hardly hiding my giggle, we all couldn't get out fast enough. One waiter offered graciously to bring out a handicap bar table, but we just left.  We went to Red Robin and enjoyed wonderful service. Tipped the waitress $20 on a $65 bill. I made sure to tell her she's the best server I have had in months.",

However, the other day, 2 co-workers and I went for lunch and the experience made me wish we had gone to McAlisters or Bad Daddy's instead of F&H.    First off, since the weather was nice, we sat outside. Unfortunately, we could smell the dumpsters from our table, so we asked to move.  After we moved, it took FOREVER for our server to come back to get our drink orders.  Finally she did, and we put in our order for an appetizer and our entrees.  We waited for a ridiculous amount of time before we saw our server again... and the restaurant was not even busy! So, when we finally did our server again, it was for the delivery of our entrees.  (Somebody forgot to put in the order for the appetizer!)  So, I might be willing to overlook the less than desirable service if the food was really good, but when my entree came out, it was meh.    I might come here again for late night drinks after dinner, but I will pass on eating here again.",

The whole place was chanting, cheering and drinking.  Good environment but not family friendly at this time of the night.  They had pretty good drink specials.  Food wise: We ordered the Ultimate Platter to share.  It included drunken chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, pretzel bites, loaded tater tots and boneless wings.  The platter was fried but not greasy, if that makes any sense.  Food came out quickly!   Parking is plentiful, parking lot was well lit  and lots of Ubers were in the area when it was time to go home. We will be back soon!",

Servers are ok, and bartenders are fine, but they still try to charge for pool, but the tables are garbage now and the place was dead on a Friday night.

They also had a couple of dart boards and pool tables if you're so inclined to play.  As far as the food goes, it was nothing spectacular. The place only had a few people when we came on a Saturday afternoon. Service was okay, decent menu with some good choices. The food didn't really stand-out to us, just kind of a typical burger. Again, kind of average.   It's a great place to go and just hang-out with a friend and beer in hand. Not really a restaurant place per se. This is the kind of place you go to for sporting events and nachos.   I would repeat - food was hot and good variety. But I would go to play some pool or watch a game with that in mind first.",

Not sure if people are going at the wrong times or ordering the wrong things??  Here's what you need to know and do to have a good experience...  Any sandwich can be turned into a wrap and vice-versa.  With that being said, I love the taste and composition of the California Chicken Club - cheese, bacon, avocado, how can you go wrong?  I get that Cali Chicken Club as a wrap with regular fries or sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are awesome!! I can't imagine a better lunch! I am also a fan of the wings as well.  Listen, its not 5-star food but it is definitely a step above your average bar food offering in the CLT area.    I've had a a few beers here after work and have never had a bad experience as far as slow service or flat beers as I've seen mentioned in other reviews.  I know this review is a bit of an outlier, but I've always had great experiences at this particular Fox and Hound.  Someone please try that Cali Chicken Club AS A WRAP and tell me how good it is!",

    "text": "We went to Fox & Hound to watch football on Sunday. There are plenty of screens and most games were on. The food was mostly good but the service was awful.  The food: We all agreed The Drunken Chicken Tenders were the best chicken tenders we've had! Great flavor and not greasy. The Black Forest Sandwich and the cheeseburger were good and the fries excellent. My wife ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad. It should've never been served. The chicken portion was skimpy there were only a few crumbs of bacon, The salad was served with NO salsa, NO egg and NO avocado! When we asked the waitress about it, she said 'I'm sorry, I should've mentioned we did not have any avocados.\" They took the salad back and my wife ordered the cheeseburger instead while we started to eat. We ordered sides of brussels sprouts but were bought the appetizer version instead. (We were trying to avoid fried foods). My son's side salad came out warm as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp.  The  Fox & Hound had a nice selection of 18 draft beers. I had a beer flight and appreciated that the different beers were nicely marked on the board. My son ordered a bottle of Chimay Blue Belgian Ale but had to wait over 5 minutes to get a glass. This beer is marked on the bottle that is should be drank from a glass. Our server and/or the bar tender should've known that.  It's the lack of attention to detail that disappoints and says 'we don't care. E.g., the ketchup bottle on our table still had the foil seal on it, the table lacked a salt shaker and one of the rolled napkins did not have a fork.  When our bill was presented to us, it still had my wife's salad on it. When we pointed this to our server she said she'd take care of it. A few minutes later, a new check was laid down on the table  (I was taken by surprise as I was approached from behind). The server said 'here' and just walked away!  We then noticed we were charged for the appetizer brussels. We asked for a manger who came and he was sorry for being out of the foods and corrected the bill (he did remove my wife's salad from the bill). He also said they were completely out of shrimp, eggs and avocado.  However, before we could let him know about the rest of our meal service, he walked away!  At the end, all four of us said this was our first and last time at  Fox & Hound.",

I'm hoping it's just this location because my family frequent this establishment often and we go so often we have a membership card that they no longer use unless you've grandfathered into the club. The customer service was poor from entering the door. First no one to seat us the bar tender acting as if she does not see us standing at the door we had to ask if we could sit anywhere before we got any attention from an employee. Once we get to our table in this empty restaurant a male waiter brought us water but never came back to take our order. However the bartender came over to clear the table next to us and again we had to ask her if we could order after sitting there for over 30 mins watching the male server bring food and getting drinks for the table next to us more than 3 times. Might I say me and my husband are African American and the table that is being served is not! You fill in the blank. I hope this was just a coincidence and not discrimination! However this will be my last time at this location and if I have another experience like this at another one I will put them on blast and leave the whole Fox & Hound chain alone! Beware poor customer service come at this location come at your own risk but I will not spend money to be treated badly and yes I wanted to leave but my husband was set on the burger so we stayed this time!",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night after attending Oktoberfest. We had been to several places for apps and a few beers and had nearly given up on even half decent service or basic steps of service throughout the night. As soon as we walked in we were greeted. We ended up playing darts and having a several rounds of drinks. Our waitress, Callie, was awesome. Super attentive and never hard to find- always doing sidework and checking on ya frequently. All four of us are in the service industry and it was such a relief to have friendly, attentive service. Will be back.",

You would think living chickens were in the kitchen. You don't get what you paid for either.  The cooks must drink too. Horrible customer service. I'll never get there again. Hope it has changes for the better.",

    "text": "Surprised to be seated immediately on a Saturday evening! Our waitress was warm and friendly and very nice to our boys which always means you win with me.  I was torn between a burger and wings and ended up choosing wings. Wonderful choice. I typically like hot and sweet so I went with hot honey and Thai chilli. The Thai chilli was WONDERFUL. Hot honey was also good but next time I will get my whole order of Thai chilli. I did add a side of tater tots that were cooked to perfection.   Hubby ordered a burger. Didn't get to taste it but it did look good and his plate was left empty.  We will definitely be back. And they're having a fundraiser for a worthy charity so we might support that!",

    "text": "I can tell the wigs were not fresh, it had a freezer taste whatever that means. Their fajitas was trash, the rice looked like mash potatoes but it was hard and grainy when you actually tasted it. I swap the rice for fries when that was the only good thing on their menu. I told the bartender I wasn't paying for the fajitas since I was not able to make actual fajitas. I suggested I'll pay for the fries and grill chicken. The bartender told me the rice was a side, so I'll be paying for the entire order because I changed the rice for the fries. Terrible customer service and food. I only ate the fries and grilled chicken. Didn't even get to make fajitas!!",
