    "text": "Several years ago we rented a car in Italy and drove all over the country. Of course, every town has its pizza. This pizza is a True representation of the Italian wood fired pizza we found all over. To be clear, this is not the New York style pizza I grew up with and you really can't compare the two.  The dough is thin and fluffy with less crunch. The sauce is light as is the cheese. It is obvious that the chef cares about his ingredients. San Marzano tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil and fresh herbs. Try the margherita. A simple and beautiful thing. Come with an open mind and an empty stomach. You will not regret it.  One thing I would love to see would be a lunch special with an 8 inch small pie. The portions are large, which is a great thing, but it's hard to stop by from work on your own for a quick bite on a lunch budget.",

I was lucky enough to go to Naples during study abroad, and Inizio tastes just like the pizza I got while I was there. Everyone is really friendly and willing to help out if you have questions. The pizzas are made to order but they cook in about 1 minute so I've never had to wait long. Unfortunately they don't offer lunch specials, but the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients.   As for what to order, I usually get the Margherita, but the Pistachio, Diavola, and Bianca flavors are really good too. They have a decent selection of local craft beers on draft, as well as some wine (half price bottles on Monday and Tuesday!!) and gelato. Be advised that you won't be able to order a slice, but they do have personal sized pizzas and large sized pizzas. While you wait for your meal to cook, they have water and cucumber water in self-serve pitchers, as well as toppings like peppers, cheese, red pepper flakes, garlic, and olive oil. They also give you a cup of marinara to dip your crust in for free with your pizza! I work right across the street so come here often and have yet to be disappointed.",

The tomato sauce that comes with the pizza is divine - so good for dipping crust in and almost drinkable. That being said, you do have to pay a premium price for it. We made the mistake of only ordering one 16\" pizza for 4 people and a salad, thinking it would be enough. But since the crust is so thin, we each could have easily had 3 slices. We debated ordering another one but decided against it in the end, although we did see another family go up and order another pizza after they had finished... What we will do next time is get 2 12\" ones. We tried the Raffaele, which had amazing flavor from the red peppers, sausages, cheese, and sauce all coming together. We also tried one of the salads, which was ok but not amazing/really worth it. I will be back for the pistachio because the pictures look so good.",

So when people bring up cost I think it misses the point. This is a meal - a good meal - a high end meal.  One of the benefits of being in a community where there is some density and wealth is that we get to have nicer things - one of those nicer things is Inizio pizza. It adds to the quality of one's life.   This is quality food. I've eaten at all the pizza places in the area. Many are \"wood fired\". Many are \"gourmet\". This is the only place that is wood fired but not burnt - it is both \"chewy\" and \"charred\" - a hard thing to get right.  I just had lunch there today - enjoyed every bite. I got a small Luigi to go, but I sat down in the restaraunt to have a piece before I got back in the car. I ended up eating the whole pizza in the restaurant. That's not to say the small is too small - it's just that it was that good and I'm a big fat pig.  Lastly, this is one of those places that makes me think of my dollars as votes - where I choose to spend my dollars is an opportunity to vote for what places I want to succeed. I gladly cast my vote for Inizio.",

Know that chain delivery pizza has its place for cheaply feeding the masses but over the same old processed crap? Want something satisfying that doesn't say \"I'm hungover\" like the cheap, giant slices of fabulous cheese & pepperoni at Benny's?   Get to Inizio.   Take some friends. Take a date. Promise to share but wind up negotiating your slice trade deals like it's a hostage situation. Or just order another -- the pies take 90 seconds to cook in the Italian-imported, wood-fired ovens. But don't forget to save room for gelato and cannoli.   You'll spend some extra dollars at Incizio. Those dollars are worth it.   Can't wait for the 2nd location to open in Dilworth this spring.",

    "text": "We have been waiting for this place to open and I am delighted to say it's been worth the wait. We are pizza nuts and when we travel we always look for the best pizza places. So, from the originals in Naples, Italy to Motorino and Roberta's in NYC, to Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, we have tried the greats. While Inizio is not True authentic naples style (which are smaller and uncut) they really hit the mark with ingredients. The crust is tender with a nice chew and great char. The tomato sauce is flavorful without the sweetness. And to find Buffalo milk mozzarella on pizza in Charlotte, NC is a dream come True. Very few places outside of Naples offers this on every pizza.  If you have never had Naples style pizza you will see that it's different than Brooklyn style or any of the other Americanized ones. So don't try to compare it to Brixx or Portofinos. The closest thing in Charlotte is probably True Pizza which is an excellent and always consistent; you just can't get buffalo moz. At Inizo you can really taste the individual, ingredient flavors; they don't just run together. The only thing I'd change is to use a little less of the pecorino cheese as a garnish. We did recently try another new Neopolitian pizza place in Mooresville called Novanta 90. It was pretty good but not great and they don't have buffalo milk cheese even though their menu kind of implies it.  We tried two of the salads the chopped and the arugula. The later was excellent, the chopped was good but nothing special and a little heavy on the dressing for my taste. For desserts, we only tried the gelato; it was good but not excellent like Va De Vie on Park Road. The cheesecake really looked great so will try it next time. The beer and wine selection was perfect for us.  Another thing I should mention is the size of the pizza. A True Neapolitan pizza serves one person and is always over $10 outside of Italy. I'd say Inizio's serves three so it's actually a decent value at $18. I'd also say their salads serve three people. So if you are up to trying a different style of pizza in Charlotte put this one on your list; its excellent pizza.  Now we just need a great pasta place!",

Within 5 mins we were enjoying this wonderful pie. Thin but not too crispy crust, flavorful pistachio pesto that wasn't overpowering, and the best part they put is a cup of their delicious sauce on the side for crust dipping. Interesting atmosphere, large shared picnic style tables, with exposed structures and open storage. I would go back any time. However it does get busy, so get there early.",

Next time I'm in town I will try a few more pizzas, they all look awesome! I would love to see a few wood fired small plates or something, but for a quick Neapolitan pizza fix this fits the bill.",

They don't have your typical American pizza, greasy, loaded with cheese and dripping in oil. Inizio has a simply delicious neapolitan pizza which is hard to recreate. The kicker is, their gelato is amazing and a lovely way to end your meal! Will def be going back with the Fam!!!",

Charlotte and the surrounding burbs have quite a few decent pizza places to choose from, and many are New York 'style' (Mario's, True Crafted, NY Pizza Express, Pie 5, Brixx, etc.), but this one is different and REALLY GOOD. We have been to Italy several times, and this is the closest we have found to True southern Italian pizzas like we have found in Capri, Naples, Sorrento, etc. It was great! They imported the ovens from Italy, and they flash cook the pies with simple fresh ingredients so that the middle is still soft, and the crust puffs up to a chewy texture. They aren't cheap, but you can tell that the ingredients are high quality. One 16 inch thin crust pizza with a drink was about $30, and fed two of us. Anyway - go try it! I predict that this one will be popular. ...oh, and the Sea Salted Caramel gelato was awesome, too. Inizio Pizza is located in a former Wolfman pizza storefront. ...the communal seating is a little weird, but you'll get over it once you taste the pizza.",

To the pizza, ordered the Capricciosa, a large for $22. The crust has potential but it was not cooked evenly. Soggy towards the middle, very little crisp and only on the very outside edge. Artichokes did not taste fresh, very few mushroom slices, the Prosciutto Ham tasted like regular deli ham. The sauce was good and had the San Marzano flavor, although runny in the middle, back to an even bake.  If the goal is excellent Neapolitan Pizza, they have some work to do, and then get to consistency.",

    "text": "I lived in Italy for 4-years and will happily admit that I'm a huge pizza snob. (I'm also a huge wine, pasta and gelato snob for what it's worth.) I went to Inizio with reservations, thinking no way would they live up to True Napoli pizza. I've never been so happy to be so wrong!!   Everything from the family style tables to the goopy pizza is True Naples. We've had the Pistachio, Margherita and Raffaele pizzas. The Pistachio is my favorite, hands down. The margherita is a close second. I want to add pepperoni next time and that might just give it an edge over the pistachio. I love the wood fired crust and the understated smokey flavor the pizzas get from being quick fired in their Italian ovens. I also love the \"wetness\" of the pizzas. True Napoli pizzas are gooey and goopy from all the sauce and cheese and occasionally grease (the from meat toppings, especially). Inizio's pizzas do not disappoint on the goop factor. They are a messy delight, hard to eat without a knife and fork.   I love the water and condiment area, too. I'm a sucker for infused water and they always have a dispenser with lemon/basil H2O or some other refreshing concoction. On the same counter, they also have the most amazing hot oil. Approach this one with caution if you don't like spicy as it has a serious heat. I love dipping my crust into this spicy, peppery oil. It's delish! They also have regular olive oil, fresh minced garlic, red pepper flakes, grated parm... The list goes on and on.   I know it's going to be hard with such beautiful pizzas staring you down, but try to make room for a salad -- the caprese and arugula are both great! If salads aren't your thing, then save room for dessert. The cannoli are out of this world and filled to order with house made cream. I dream about the salted caramel gelato. And, our most recent selection, the amaretto cheesecake, also impressed... thick and creamy, it stuck to the roof of your mouth in the most amazing way.   As if all of that wasn't enough, they also have a good beer and wine selection. I was impressed to see 5 or 6 craft beers on draught, including Peroni if you want to go 100% Italian. I opted to go a little more local and enjoyed a Triple C Hefeweizen on our last visit.   Counting down the days until our next visit!",

When we entered, we were immediately greeted with a smiling staff member welcoming us. We took a bit to review their menu which had several delicious choices. We ordered the Capricciosa - prosciutto ham, mushrooms, sauce and buffalo mozzarella (loving this cheese). Many of the chain pizza places use too much sauce which drowns out the taste of the other ingredients. Well, you will not get that here - just enough sauce and a hearty helping of fresh ingredients.  Watching the staff create our masterpiece was a plus. From tossing the dough to piling on of the toppings to entering their wood fire oven. While waiting, we ordered a couple of beers. They have six brews on tap and also wine available. We were stoked to find out all their pizzas are 16\"! Score on the leftovers!!! We also noticed they have desserts too (gelato, cannolis, and cheesecake), so save some room. From what I heard, their cheesecake is worthy of a cheat day to treat yourself. Also, if you order a salad, be prepared as they serve up healthy portions that can feed at least four.   While enjoying our brews and pizza, we noticed that the staff members appeared to be cross trained as they switched between positions - taking orders, prepping the pizza, cleaning tables, and cooking. They worked and communicated well with each other and one could tell that it was a positive working environment. I loved that every customer who dined in was greeted by a staff member at some point during their stay.   We really enjoyed this place. They have picnic style tables, napkins and silverware provided on each table, and pre-made items to either take for take out orders or season will eating in. They share a parking lot but we had no problem finding parking. This place gets busy around 5:30 pm, so be patient. The staff moves customers along efficiently, clean tables quickly and there is a lot of sitting inside and out.  Bravo!!!!!",

    "text": "It was time to start off our Memorial Day weekend and we decided it was Pizza, not BBQ, that was needed.  So, after a visit to a local brewery we headed east to Inizio just to see what all the hype was about.   Let's just say Inizio isn't just hype.  It's fantastic in every way.  From the minute you walk in the door you are greeted with smiles and exceptionally helpful staff members who offer advice, explain the pies, and even offer samples of ingredients. How cool.  Speaking of ingredients, one that jumped out at me was the Buffalo mozzarella. What what  No, it isn't a wing sauce cheese. It's actually a cheese made from buffalo milk.  We sampled it and it had a nice texture with a slight sweetness. Score.  We ended up ordering the Capricciosa.  It included Artichoke, Prosciutto Ham, Mushroom, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella...Yum. At 16\" it's a nice size for all the toppings you.    They make the pizza the Neapolitan-style.  Lots of fresh ingredients with less sauce and cheese than you find in the U.S. (I lived in Italy and love pizza there).    They use a wood-fired oven which slightly chars the crust. I like that a lot.  I think they could have charred it slightly more, but that was insignificant when you taste it.  Other items they offer include salads that feed four and cheesecake. I so wanted a slice, but held off.   They also have a nice selection of craft beer, including OMB, Birdsong, Triple C, NODA.  They also have Peroni Beer on tap if you want the full Italian experience.    The atmosphere is very inviting.  Every seat in the house is good.  You can watch your pizza being made even from the farthest corners of the restaurant.    I'll say it again, the staff was friendly, fun, and efficient. The pizza was great and gave me and my wife enough leftovers to take home.  Awesome all the way around.",

Waapai! This was some of the most delicious pizza I have ever eaten! Excellent flavor, lightly charred not to much of anything except for great!  I had the Diavolo and added pepperoni. It was the small pizza 18$.",

Authentic Neapolitan style pizza made fresh to order and some great local beers on draught. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.  My friend had the Raffaele (Sweet Pepper, Sausage, Roasted Onion, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella, Garlic, Pecorino) and I had the Cavoletti (Brussels Sprout, Pancetta, Fior De Latte, Pecorino, Buffalo Mozzarella) and both were amazing. I was so impressed with Cavoletti because they managed to put Brussels sprouts on a pizza and it actually worked! Amazing. I will definitely be back!",

Slowly savoring each bite. Carefully dipping my crusty pizza crust sticks in the obviously homemade marinara sauce. (Nice touch)  Aight... I didn't go there, so I can't comment on the service or what the place even looks like. My dude picked up the pie... After complaining for at least 2 minutes on how expensive the pizza would be. I mean I get we're on a budget but every now and then you want something good. And if we're gonna get pizza... Just once I'd like to take a break from papa Johns. I mean they ain't all that. They're just a filler food.   But this! Inizio.... Oooooh you just gained one more fan.   Our pie had sweet peppers that complemented the saltiness of the meat. And the mozzarella (brings fingers to mouth for a kiss) perfection! I'm a cheese connoisseur and they did that!   Yes! 1000 times yes I will be back... Well I didn't go there myself... But yea whether I go or my dude picks up... We in there!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that maybe   I'm just not a fan of Napoletana style pizza. I've never been to Italy to have the real thing but I have travelled the US eating at the top pizza restaurants.  And I used to work for a pizza manufacturer developing products. Overall my experience was good.  I was greeted by a friendly order taker and the rest of the staff was just as friendly.  After ordering a couple of pies,  I sat overlooking the dining room to notice that it is all picnic bench style of seating.   My pies arrived served on a sheet pan, unusual but it works.  Only if they would warm them up to keep the product hotter. I had their mushroom pizza and their meat and picante pepper pies.  The exterior crust was chewy but did not have much of the character I was hoping for from a 900F oven. Not much mallard reaction going on here. Now the reason I'm not a fan; the remainder of the pizza is so thin that it cannot support the topping ingredients. The  mushrooms were  flavorless and the meats glistened with moisture, soaking the crust.  Actually, the dough was not allowed to cook.  The texture was lifeless and the flavor bland.   I did order 12 inch pies and the 16 inch looked a bit better on others tables so I may try this restaurant one more time.",

I was hoping the place wouldn't be packed, because every picture I've seen, the place was crawling with people. Not today. We entered after the lunch rush and not a soul was there. Great in my book.   We ordered the arugula salad and the CAPRICCIOSA Pizza, which comes with Artichoke, Prosciutto Ham, Mushroom, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella. What a freaking home run! The pizza was done in less than 2 minutes and awesome: there's hot oil, olive oil, hot peppers, and pecorino cheese available and believe me it doesn't need it. Great place. Definitely coming back.  ************ Very important side note. My wife is celiac and we came here as an experiment to see if she gets sick off this pizza. She did not. The flour is \"00\" and imported from Italy.",

    "text": "Take out- Disappointed.  We wanted to try this pizza based on several great reviews from neighbors.  I just got home and we tried it.  The pizza smells great, but ours was not fully cooked.  The center of the pizza was floppy and drippy.  The salami was good, but there was too much of it to make the pizza too salty....  $22 pizza in the trash.  Maybe they have some kinks to work out or we were unlucky.  It will be awhile before we try it again.  Since we live less than a mile from them, it's a shame.  UPDATE:  Tonight we went back and dined in.  The seating was ample and it was a friendly environment.  We tried the margherita pizza.  It was ready in a few minutes.  I will just say, it was very good pizza.  While the center was still under cooked, the pizza tasted great.  We had to cut about 3\" off of each slice so the kids could eat it with a fork because it was not firm like the rest of the pie.  This was not an issue for the adults.  It came with just the right amount of basil and cheese.  We really loved this pizza and are glad we gave this place another try.    The key here is that take out just did not seem to work.  Dining in was great...  It also allowed us to try the gelato!",

Exciting that all of the main ingredients are imported from Italy. Been on an Italy kick lately.   The pizzas are pretty large. We ordered two for our family of five including 2 hungry teens. You can order a specialty pie or create your own. If you create your own you can get two toppings max as the crust is thin though the edges are thick and doughy like breadsticks.   We ordered the Margherita and one with spicy salami and sausage. The ingredients were fresh and the service was quick. We also got the Italian chopped salad which was a nice change from your typical salad with olives and ham as well.   Get wines by the glass or bottle and beers too. Certainly looking forward to going back without the kids to try some of the more specialty pies.",

    "text": "So my favorite pizza that is not New York or Chicago is Antico in Atlanta, which could be my only comparison. I was going to eat a slice and write my review but this pizza was SO good I had to eat half my pizza first.   I don't typically compare other types of pizzas but in ATL, Antico wins, in the Bay Area, Zachary's (Chicago style) wins. In Charlotte, Inizio wins.   Ordering a 12\" Raffaele, I took my first bite and immediately was hit with the sweet pepper contrasting to a tomato sauce that had balanced acidity. Next bite had sausage with a hint of spice, enough heat right next to the crunch of the onion. The crust light yet toasted.   Washed down with a crisp Orange Sanpellegrino, and I was a happy camper. Variety of gelato but I went with the Cannoli, stuffed to order. The ricotta, vanilla, nutmeg center is fresh and AMAZING.   Guess I'll have to head home and recaffeinate with some Forte Legato Coffee, as this is an experience that could put you to sleep, warm and content.",

The inside is adorable and has hardwood picnic table style seating, so you might be sitting next to people you don't know. I found the pizza to be super inventive and fun. They use a particular flour called 00 flour and fresh yeast, sea salt, and water to make the crust. They've imported 2 large scale ovens from Italy that bake a pizza in 90 seconds flat at nearly 900 degrees. The crust is by far the best I've had in Charlotte. The pistachio pizza is a customer favorite that has pistachios, a pistachio-pesto sauce, mozzarella, garlic, and ricotta. It was amazing with a memorable nutty-pesto taste that you will not get tired of. We also had a special pizza made with a pumpkin-based sauce and buffalo mozzarella. It had a fun, earthy-fall taste that I made me come back for more. I only wish that I had made room for the gelato, as it looked absolutely wonderful. The service was impeccable and the place was very clean. They have wine and a few beers on draft. You order and pay at the counter and they deliver to your table. I've heard that on the weekends it is extremely busy and filled with children and wine-drinking parents. So, it'll be a weekday spot for me.",

This place is wonderful. I, of course, checked them out on Yelp before going and everyone was saying the Pistachio pizza was what to order. I will admit, I was scared. Order it. It's amazing. The perfect amount of cheese, with great flavor! I'm not sure if this comes with, but we were given some tomato sauce for dipping, which was great to dip our crust ends in. We also got a more basic pizza, which was also fantastic. We ate every, single bite.   I will say, I was a little disappointed in the cannoli. I wouldn't order it again. However, the salted caramel gelato was a prefect end to a wonderful meal.",

    "text": "Before Inzio, Pure Pizza was my favorite shop in town. I hadn't had too many places that could come close.  Both pizzerias excel in an ultra-thin crust with a fast bake and sublime ingredients. It's not NY style, it's thinner than that. Both are a bit expensive all things considered.  This pizza is heavily browned or blackened on the outside crust bubbles, while the middle is just done enough to reduce the chewiness to an acceptable level. The meats and vegetables are absolutely sublime. I'd feel free to experiment with toppings, but their menu offerings are solid.  My only gripe is this ultra-fast bake also produces inordinate moisture. The very center of the pizza falls apart since water doesn't have time to evaporate in the oven unlike more traditional american pizzas. Your pizza will drip water and grease to an extent, but even the water coming off each slice is hugely flavorful.  The gelato is good and I'd get it again, but the pizza is incredible. My barometer for superior pizza is this: If you can't think of anything else but the slices in your fridge, ruminating over them constantly until you give up and eat them just an hour or two after getting home, then the pizza place is doing something right. Inizio does that with flying colors.",

    "text": "Well.. I will first say that pizza is a tough food to rate as people simply like different kinds. We just finished eating here and I will say that the staff is super friendly. Very attentive and nice.  The place itself is not comfortable to sit in. Cramped quarters and table sharing. The high top tables are painful to sit in. Again, some people like them.   The pizza was bland to me - surprisingly so. However, the crust is very good. Now, as I mentioned earlier - pizza is a specialized preference and I know some people fight over pineapple on pizza. For us, pineapple is life. we love versions of Hawaiian pizza. However, no pineapple found here.  We got the margarita pizza and the pistachio pesto.  The pizza to me is rated a 2.. wish we would have gotten one with meat on it. Again, nothing wrong - just didn't fit our taste.  We then got the cannoli and wow, loved it.  The cannoli and the staff made this a 3 star - the pizza can stay.  At least for us.  If we go back, would try one with meat etc. Not sure we will go back. Especially dropping $35 on 2 small pizzas with limited toppings after tax. Also - no refills and no sweet tea. Just bottles.",

I like onion but this was not good.  The tomatoes were small cherry like tomatoes and were the shining star of the whole experience.   My sister compared the pizza crust to naan, which I love but not as a pizza crust.  It was soft and chewy and made for a very floppy experience, a poor base for the toppings.  There were black oven burn marks in places that made me hopeful that the next bite would be firmer but no.  If this is authentic Neapolitan pizza fine but I guess I am not a fan! I am glad I didn't stop and get this to take to my parents', they would have hated it.  They have fresh garlic and tiny peppers in little containers that you can put on your pizza.  The peppers were great but very hot.  I really hated that I had to get a bottled soft drink.  They only offer, besides wine, bottled beverages.  I want ice in my drink.  I'm glad I killed a lemming but I will definitely not be back. 2 stars bc it was clean the people were nice and obviously other people liked it.",

However, this establishment is only 3 weeks old and still ironing out some kinks. The crust, sauce, and cheese are perfect. The crust was a bit soggy by the end of the pie. Also, I'd like double the amount of cheese, but this review is only applicable to the type of pizza I tried (anchovy and olive). The interior is stylish, spotlessly clean, and comfortable. Wait staff are friendly and attentive. This place is using high end ingredients and charging fair prices. I plan to visit them again soon and frequently!!",

My husband and I are new to the area and we're craving some wood fired pizza. We found Inizio on Yelp, saw the fantastic reviews, and had to give it a try!   We had a margarita pizza and a pistachio Pizza and oh boy, it was amazing! The pistachio Pizza sounded like it would be an odd combination, but it turns out it's the best invention ever!   The staff was kind and prompt with service. John came to our table and asked how we were liking the pizza and of course we told him it was amazing and it hit the spot! He thanked us and left after chatting with us a bit. He later came back to the table and welcomed us to the area with two cannolis! One chocolate chip and one pumpkin. Both of which were to die for!  Thank you John and the staff at Inizio! We had a great experience and look forward to returning!",

We ordered pistachio pizza and it was very good. For pistachio lovers like me, I enjoyed it. It was thin and baked perfectly, not too burnt. Other than food, staffs are very nice and attentive. Even though they don't take your order at the table, they check on table to table if everything is okay. They know how to provide good service other than good food. I will definitely go back to try other pizzas.",

My family and I have frequented this place on several occasions ranging from Tuesday to Family lunch outing to teenager birthday luncheon.   The staff are so welcoming and readily available to help you make a choice and to share and discuss the history and the story behind the ovens from Italy that were hand made.   We have enjoyed a number of pizzas from margarita to white sauce to cheese. All were flavorful and brought out piping HOT. The picnic tables ambiance is very relaxing and communal like. We met some nice folks sitting at these long hard wood tables.  I tried my first cannoli here as I never tried one before the cashier spoke so highly of it and shared with me that they make them fresh for you to watch. I was intrigued so I gave it a whirl and not was it good. I had the Pistachio.  Great place tucked in the shopping center.",

My only criticism was that the crust was slightly burnt, but this is minor.  We also had a plain cannoli and a caprese salad (unfortunately was unable to get pictures), which were also good! As far as customer service it was exceptional.  The employees were friendly and the manager would go around to make sure everyone was enjoying their food.  The music and environment was good.

    "text": "We just moved to Charlotte from the West Coast, and I am a huge pizza snob. When I discovered Inzio, I was very excited to try it. My daughter and I went for dinner, ordered a capricciosa and pistachio pizza, anda seasonal cannoli (peppermint mocha).   The food is fantastic. The pizza is well done, cooked in a 900 wood-burning oven. The crust is thin and soft just as an authentic Neapolitan style pizza should be.   My only complaint is that it is extremely loud within the restaurant. I am not an old fuddy-duddy, I used to live in Las Vegas the city of sounds and lights, however I was finding myself at full anxiety level sitting within Inzio's walls.   Here's the problem, the restaurant has community tables. While I am not opposed to the seating arrangement, having found that it worked well at places like the OMB brewery, at this pizza place it simply does not work.   Tables of misbehaving children are screaming, throwing pizza dough, kicking other customers in the back who are seated behind them, in short...it is a nightmare dining experience.  My daughter and I ate half of our pizzas and got the rest to go, feeling that it would be much better for us to take a cold pizza home and eat it there then it would be to indoor any further torture while being seated at this pizzeria.  I'll definitely go back for the food, but will take it to go.",

The Tuesday evening that my family of four was there was jam-packed with diners; in fact, we had to wait 10 minutes for half a community table to open up.  We split a large margarita style pizza for $18 and a Caprese salad $10. The pizza was as delicious as reported  but the salad was just average and pretty small for the money.  Overall experience is pretty chaotic and if you want a more relaxing environment you may want to try it off hours. They did offer some excellent specials including half-off wine bottles on Tuesdays and $3 draft on Wednesdays. They also offer a tasty gelato at a reasonable price and on special for $2 on Thursdays. I would rate this place a Gotta Try but not at dinner time.",

I'm sure in those situations I was happy and full, but still a bit uncomfortable from doing something so 'wrong'. When I got home from having dinner here, I noticed I didn't get that feeling. Possibly because the pizza has a light, yet absolutely delicious taste?   I'm not sure about the hows or the whys, I just know I waited too long to give this place a try. My date and I chose the pizza with the sweet peppers, mozzarella, onions and pecorino cheese. He doesn't eat pork, so we opted for no sausages. We tried to do half with sausage and half without, but that was not allowed strangely. Warning to any meat lovers- only pork selections are available. He was disappointed with that. I was unbothered since the New Yorker in me prefers my pizza cheese only, meat isn't a requirement on pizza. So he rolled with it for the evening. He enjoyed the pizza, despite the occasional grumbles of his 'vegetarian' meal.  It's a casual, yet well designed restaurant, fitting for the area. I've only been to a handle of pizza restaurants around town (shameful) but this one has to be one of the best.",

Atmosphere is light industrial with fun family style tables and benches.  Location is an old Wolfman pizza place in a nondescript strip center but pretty easy to find and no problem with parking.

Toppings are authentic:  buffalo mozzarella, spicy salami, Calabrian peppers. And the sauce is fresh, sweet and bursting with flavor. Best pizza in Charlotte!  Hands down!  Oh and the cannoli is outstanding, too!",

    "text": "This South Charlotte pizza joint serves up authentic Neapolitan pies on a perfectly baked crust, with a wonderful selection of delicious toppings that will satisfy any appetite. Inzio treats pizzamaking like a craft to be savored, not a product to be churned out for the masses. So while you'll pay more for a pie here than at most other local restaurants, you won't regret the modest upcharge. My family shared the 18' Margharita pizza, which was delivered to our table in less than 10 minutes fresh from an oven that looked like it had been delivered straight from Italy. Even my picky six-year-old was devouring the warm, crispy slices, and for once, we didn't need a take-home box for leftovers.  In addition to the pizza, my wife and I also shared a wonderful Caesar salad, and the gelato and cannolis were the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. There's also a great selection of wines by the glass and 4 - 5 craft beers on tap, including some great local brews like Olde Meck Copper and Birdsong's Higher Ground. My only complaint is that the restaurant wasn't yet serving personal pies when we visited, although the owner assured me they were only a couple weeks away from adding them to the menu.   Inzio comes as close as anything to replicating Antico, an Atlanta pizzeria that sets the standard for authentic craft pies in the South. Charlotte is lucky to have it, and my family and I will definitely be back for more of their delicious pizza.",

I wasn't sure if it was just me, but my wife mentioned the same thing prior to me saying anything. The crust, however, is soft.   The gelato is good, but not as good as Alino's up in Mooresville. A few other notes...  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  The lower benches are more comfortable and spacious.  There is flavored water and plain water that you can get yourself from jugs. The bathrooms are small but clean.  As expected due to higher-quality ingredients, prices are on the high side. Pizza is cooked in 90 seconds.",

I got the pizza Bianca and it took my back to my Naples days! I completely recommend the cannoli. It was heavenly, and exactly what I had been craving at 24 weeks pregnant   If you don't know about pizza from this region, it is supposed to have burnt spots. The sauce is thinner and tangy. It's not meant to be heavy like American pizza. The crust is smooth and not crispy. It'll more resemble naan, but better!   My Fiance ordered the Diavola which he enjoyed. He said the peppers were a little salty to him, but likely because they are imported (canned).  My future mother-in-law is vegan, and she was able to simply ask for no cheese and add veggies for her pizza. The staff was very accommodating. I recommend for larger parties. It seems like the seating is perfect for that! The decor is also very pleasant!  My only suggestion would be to get some San Benedetto Peach Tea!",

Good selection of local beers but once again it was a little on the pricey side (~$7 pint). You help yourself to glasses of water, fresh hot olive oil, various condiments for the pizza, etc.   Tables are large community style tables and the decor is very modern but clean and inviting.   You can see them rolling and preparing the pizza dough in a special room that has lots of windows right there front and center.... almost as cool as seeing the big ovens in action as they cook your pizza!",

Excellent pizza with high quality ingredients. I just wish they had a location closer to Uptown.   One suggestion would be to offer a smaller size individual pizza-their offerings are great, but they have to be shared.   Can't wait to go back-definitely worth the trip.",

First off - very pleased to see real plates and cutlery and it shows that they really do listen to customers' suggestions. The Luigi was also much better than the Diavola we had last time. Toppings were spread more evenly this time and the crust area was kept to just over an inch (see pics I posted). I have seen others mention the issue of \"too much crust\" so it looks like they've also addressed this as well.    Very impressed with their efforts to continually improve, and we can't wait to return soon to try the other pizza varieties. Well deserved jump from a 4 to 5 star review.",

Atmosphere is contemporary and clean and they had Dean Martin playing in the background.   Service was very good. The guy behind the counter tonight made great suggestions to me and was helpful with what to substitute a meat topping for on my pizza, as I was looking for only veggies.  The price is high ($18-22) for a pie but they are fairly large. It is still around what I would pay at another pizza place with lower quality ingredients.  I wasn't planning on spending that much but I really enjoyed it.   I also tried a cannoli - whoever makes the filling is a genius. It is so hard to find a good cannoli in Charlotte as most places settle with pre made filling. They fill them and dip them there.  I live somewhat far away and will visit when possible but I wish the business all the best!",

We started our meal with a shared Italian Chopped salad. Quality blend of flavorful greens (no iceberg) including arugula, cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil and a tasty Balsamic Glaze. A great start to any meal or a meal all by itself.  We decided on 2 pies (small) to satisfy our differing tastebuds. My Bride ordered the Margherita DOB. A perfect blend of quality ingredients starting with a San Marzano tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella, basil, garlic and she added pepperoni. All good......all gone!  I ordered the Pizza Raffaele; the same delicious sauce & fresh mozzarella, sweet peppers, sausage and garlic.  An absolute flavor explosion with each bite especially if you dip the crispy crust into the same quality tomato sauce which is also served as a side.  All good...all gone!  Expect a bit of char as the ovens are actual wood burning not the gas variety you can find elsewhere. But quality ingredients and a quality product comes at a price... but it's worth it!  PS: the Team is friendly, helpful and followup on their work by stopping by and asking about your meal....more than once!",

I notice on the menu they don't do any or multiple substitutions so kinda makes it hard, my bf is a plain eater, and I'm not very adventurous myself so we aren't sure which pizza to order..... he loves a regular pepperoni pizza and from looking at the menu, I don't know if I can order that? Or a plain cheese?   I took off 1 Star bc there's no telephone number and you can't call!!  I hate placing orders online especially if you want certain toppings off or on or something light or extra, and you can't call! Or to ask what gelato flavors they have!! Please please make a phone line for people who don't order online to call! Sometimes you need to ask a question and you can't call to do that!  They have great cannolis here and sorbet and gelato!! Lol we always get sorbet or gelato while we wait for our to go order:)  it's very cute inside with the benches. They have a table in the front where they have all the different condiments you need for pizza in lil containers like peppercorn, Parmesan cheese, vinegar, olive oil etc etc  I would like to try this place one night soon and sit outside bc I think they have outside seating and on a cool night that might be verrrrry nice!!!  Plus all the staff that work here are very very nice. Very helpful, they look happy to be there, just can't be any nicer and helpful especially with ordering.  The kitchen is open and you can see the pizzas being made which is pretty cool! The cooks look genuinely into making pizzas and happy to be there. This place is def kid safe, it's real loud inside when it gets busy and it's a nice place to bring a family with little ones:)",

Inconspicuously located in a shopping center, you can miss it if you don't look carefully. It doesn't look like much on the outside. Inside, you will find an expansive pizza haven. I ordered a margherita and it was ready within a few minutes. Neapolitan pizza is baked at a very high temperature for only 90 seconds. I grabbed it in a box and took it to go. It was perfect. The cheese was outstanding, and the pecorino on top was a nice addition and not one that I was used to. It's a great place for a group with the large long tables and the speed with which they whip up your order!",

The main front cashiers were very informative, if this is your first time here and eating Neapolitan pizza.  We got the classic margarita And it  is really really good, I mean this is what real pizza is about! All about simple but fresh ingredients.. the dough or crust is perfectly cooked with their brick oven pizza with a nice chew. The sauce was very light and perfect amount of tart to sweet ratio.  The cheese was very fresh, light, and salty.   Biggest issue: PRICE to portion ratio.   I understand fresh ingredients is not cheap however this is way over priced for the portion. Forget the individual portion you need their biggest size to be remotely full. However when you do one of their most cheapest which is the plain Margarita and just that with tip no drink after taxes are $22... now imagine if you got a drink and also had their pizza with toppings.. $25-28 for pizza....  I suggest they have a certain promotional night for their pizzas during one of their weekdays.  They do have them for like draft beer or $1 off gelato which Who cares about... but something like that with their pizza would be great, cause boy it is exxxxxxpensive for the portions!",

There are no complaints conserving those aspects. However, I was a bit disappointed with the pizza, considering all the hype that surrounds it. I felt that the Margherita pizza was bland in taste and the crust lacked extra flavor. I also had the Raffaele, in which I had the same concerns about the sauce and the crust. The sausage on the pizza also lacked a strong taste, and the texture was too rubbery for my preferences.   Overall, I would not say that the food is terrible. Definitely good food, and the service is phenomenal. But the food didn't blow me away or separate itself from other pizza joints in Charlotte in terms of taste. The search for a perfect pizza in charlotte continues. Or I'll just stick to waiting for pizza whenever I go to New York.",

Just have to wait.   Only complaint I have is the payment tablets and \"shame\" you into picking a tip. This is not unique to this establishment and perhaps just my personal irritation. I am a generous tipper, perhaps even more generous than most. However I convey when it's earned. I don't like it when I feel obligated to tip upfront, especially when I have to stand in line to order and we have to bus our own tables. I wish every establishment would stop that function (because I know for a fact you can bypass or delete that function).   This hasn't stopped us from going. I just hate ordering.",

The staff were really friendly with my niece/nephew giving them bread dough to play with and showed them how to roll/throw a pizza in the air.   The food came out really quickly and they have multiple oils (including a really spicy red sauce) available by the pizza station. The only downside of the restaurant is they don't allow for addition or substitution of pizza toppings. Overall, would highly recommend for a good food/atmosphere pizza place.",

    "text": "Authentic people, serving authentic neapolitan pies, who should be appreciated for their craft.   Anyone who has made pizza dough at home from scratch knows that True neapolitan dough requires care and patience to get right. Inizio's crust is suberb. Wonderful flavors that are coaxed out of a dough made only with flour, yeast, salt and water.  The Italian made wood fired ovens give just the right amount of char.   We had the Capricciosa pie. Good quality toppings. The ham was thicker than store bought prosciutto, which held up well in their 900 degree oven. Great tomato flavor from the sauce. Was a bit runny after the pizza rested and cooled a bit, maybe due to some moisture release from the mushrooms, and the thin crust got a bit soggy. But the simple combination of flavors brought a smile to our faces as we washed everything down with some Copper drafts.  Friday evening at 6pm and there was a line out the door, but it moved quickly thanks to the hard working staff and those quick cooking 900 degree ovens. We really enjoyed the communal tables and chatting with the family next to us.  A little pricey but we weren't expecting mega chain pizza. As a newly opened restaurant there will be some kinks to work out. Good to know that we don't have to travel to CT or NY for authentic neapolitan pizza. We'll be back to try another.",

They don't do orders over the phone.  You have to come in and place the order. It's no big deal though because they have two wood fired ovens (from what I could see) that hit 950 degrees and pop the pies out in just a few minutes.  I ordered 4-pies the other night and they had them done in 10mins!    I will be a regular at this place and would stress any pizza lover to at least give it a chance.",

The crust is more robust and holds the sauce and cheese really well. I had my whole family with us and we ordered a Pistacio Pesto pizza, Pizza Margherita, and a Margherita with pepperoni.  The pesto pizza was delish! It had creamy cheese dolloped on and beautiful toasty pistacios; my family that eats meat LOVED the pepperoni pizza; and we all devoured the gorgeous Pizza margherita. I also ordered the arugula salad....it was alright, but left a lot to be desired for the price. Next time we'll just do pizza.   Lauren, the hostess who took our order was as sweet as can be and even gave us some nice coupons for our next visit!! Thank you Inizio's for existing and making such lovely pizza!",

Double zero flour to achieve the less dense lighter crust, fresh tomato sauce without the overpowering amount of herbs and the best fresh mozzarella. We enjoy the Margherita with mushrooms.  The salads are fresh and enough to share among 3-4 people if you want just enough as a side salad or starter.   Bottle of Pinot Grigio very reasonably priced or, Peroni Italian beer too is great with the meal.  Total tab was very reasonable for quality and unique style product offered.  This has become one of our favorite places to hang out for a nice casual and relaxing meal.  Obviously may not be for everyone based on some reviews. No doubt there are many traditional pizzerias out there which offer a different experience, price and menus. Variety is good! Of course if you just want to fill your gut with \"manufactured\" pizza there's always many choices in the freezer section in supermarkets and the pretend pizza at Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, etc.  Having grown up in NYC and lived in lots of places in the US and overseas, I like that we now have Inzio to choose among our choices.

I wasn't going to buy him his own $18 pizza and end up spending $40 for the 3 of us.  We wound up having to pick stuff off of his slices.  I worked at a pizza place before as a server.  I wasn't being crazy.  Just wanted one of their specialty pies with one half cheese only.  So they refuse to do half and half but apparently you can't even remove a topping from the whole pie either.  Weird rules for apparently no reason.",

    "text": "Ok. Wow. Like wow. A little background. I first tried this style of pizza back in 2010 in Atlanta at the Goliath Antico Pizza. My wife and I loved it and the standard as to judge all other pizza was born. I then found mighty DeSano pizza in Nashviile in 2013 and knew I had found anther love.  Then, the day before my birthday in June, we trekked to Mooresville and found Alino Pizzeria. Hot damn, now I had finally found a real pizza place that could give Antico a run for their money AND they were only an hour away from my south Charlotte abode. Life was good, I was content... Or so I thought. Then, I heard about Inizio. Wait what?  10 minutes from my house and has been open for 5 months?  No, how have I not heard?  So, I texted my friend Will and said  \"Hey, there is a pizza place near your house we just decided we want to try tonight. Any interest in meeting us over there in a little bit?\"   His exact response,  \"What time\" \"Inizo's is the shit\" \"And they have cheap gelato on Thursdays\" Two things then occurred to me: 1. Wow, this place is so good it doesn't even have to be named! and; 2.  Will is such a shit, keeping this great place all to himself and NEVER mentioning it me  That being said, the fam and I packed up the Acadia and headed to meet Will for dinner. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the Pistachio pizza w/ pepperoni. Look at the picture I posted, this stuff is the real deal. Here's what happened when I took my first bite of the pistachio pizza. The whole world slowed down. Honest to God, like stopped. My kids were yapping in slow motion. Antico, DeSano, and Alino all slid down my mind as this new pizza giant  clearly rose to the top. Can pizza really be that amazing? Is this dudes review really on point?  Well put down your iPhone and go find out for yourself. But seriously, the quality of the crust, the perfection of the pistachio pesto base, the sensational blend of quality ingredients, the soft fresh ricotta, the mild yet salty buffalo mozzarella, and the paper thin crispy pepperoni. BOOM. Yea, it's that good. And Will is right, $2 gelato on Thursday. I had the sea salt caramel. Unbelievable. The way the caramel stands out so clearly but in such a clean crisp way on your tongue is True magic. I really can't say anything even remotely negative about this visit. Go there. Get pizza. Get gelato. Enjoy life. It's that simple. Sorry Will, the secrets out....",

    "text": "Finally had an afternoon off with my guy for us to be able to make our way down to try this place out. To say I was impressed wouldn't even do this place justice. This was definitely some of the best if not the best pizza and salad I have had in charlotte in a long time. To be completely honest the star of the show for me anyway was the caprese salad. To die for. I have no idea how they make the lemon vinaigrette that they used but I would do a lot of things to know how to make it. The combination of arugala and fresh basil leaves was genius and left me running to the store to buy these two ingredients to mix in with all my salads that I make at home. The ingredients they use are clearly authentic and amazingly fresh. We ordered the margherita pizza and it was hands down the best version of this pizza in town no questions asked. The buffalo mozzarella that they use is the best Ive ever tasted and the sauce is light and delicate and simply wonderful.  The crust is fresh delicious with the perfect chewy texture that's it meant to have and the fact that they create this pie in 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven is a wonder on its own.  The interior is very nice with wood paneling on the walls that I would love to do to the inside of my home. They have a small self service table with ice water plain and infused I liked the infused. Also with small portions of free add-ons for your pizza like peppers, garlic and other things.  The staff were super attentive and friendly and seemed to enjoy being there. I truly feel that everything was fairly priced especially given the high quality ingredients. I definitely want to say one thing though do not come here thinking you can order a pizza and it be a chain pizza place type experience you cannot come here and order a hamburger topped pizza and split it into 2 halves with different toppings its not that type of place and its even more amazing for this fact. This pizza is True to its style and its to die for.  Also word to the wise its whole pizzas so come with a friend or multiple people or come super hungry and expect to likely still have plenty of leftovers.  Save room for the gelato also its wonderful as well I loved it and I'm not even a sweets person. They also serve beer and wine and if I'm not mistaken they sell by the bottle and the glass both.  This place is how I would eat pizza every single time if I could and even given the drive ill be coming here as much as I can.",

We were shocked at how closely authentic it was including the options, some with red sauce and some without. Not too mention the pistachio one as pistachio is huge in Naples.

To top it all off, we had asked if they had milk for our children, which they said they didn't and we understood completely.

They use buffalos milk mozzarella  and marzano tomatoes which were amazingly good (5/5).  We went with the Raffaele, which has sweet peppers (which have a kick), and roasted onions.  We ordered the large and im kind of embarrassed to say my wife and I finished it all...it was that good (5/5).    Set up inside the restuarant is simple and there us ample bench style seating (5/5).

    "text": "We stopped at Inizio yesterday afternoon with my family. They must have just opened because we were the only people there. The restaurant was clean and has a rustic, industrial feel to it. The girl behind the counter was very helpful and answered all our questions. We chose three pizzas, the pistachio pesto (with no pistachios),pepperoni , and margarita. The pizzas came out within a few minutes and we quickly began stuffing our faces. The pizzas were a hit with both the kids and adults. I love that they have a toppings bar to add to your pizza. The fresh garlic was amazing! It isn't an inexpensive way to feed a family but it is worth the price with taste and quality of ingredients.",

Only three minutes in the oven, one to cool at the table and three minutes into my belly (all while never letting go of the Higher Ground Draught in my left hand)!  Specials rotate - sometimes it's $3.50 craft beers (Weds I think) and Thursdays are $2 small gelatos. The Salted Caramel is \"to die for\" and the Amarena Cherry is crazy good!",

They have lots of unique flavors that I love - try the brussel sprout pizza or the pistachio (kind of like a pesto pizza!).  Haven't had a pizza that I didn't like there.

I get that they are importing ingredients and trying to deliver an \"authentic\" pizza but $50 is steep.   Experience - $50 shouldn't feel like fast food. You place your own order, search for your own place to sit among the communal tables, get your own water, get your own plates, get your own to-go box, get your own utensils out of a bucket on each table. We would have gotten a second beer but would have had to stand in line again. As soon as we stopped chewing someone was there to clear the table, and because people are standing around waiting for a place to sit you feel rushed. Also, insanely loud.   Again, the pizza is really good but at this price point you should enjoy the experience as well.",

    "text": "If you've been to Naples and eaten a traditional margherita pizza - your tastebuds will soar back to a True Italian experience at Inizio. Spectacular ingredients and perfectly charred crust. The san marzano tomato sauce is insanely good. I really appreciated the cup served on the side for dipping my final bites of crust. Also the olive oil on the condiment bar was top notch as well...also nice for crust dipping.  Their margherita carries the DOP Italian authenticity mark of approval! Def start here on the menu as it is exactly how the Italians do pizza! The pecorino cheese sprinkled on top was perfection. In my opinion - no need for any other toppings! At first I thought the price was a bit much ($18) for a traditional margherita - even in the expense capital of America in the middle of Hollywood - they are usually $10-12. THEN I was told that they have 2 sizes. A 16 in pizza is $18 and the smaller traditional size of 12 in is $12...right in line w all my experience! So if you bring a friend- by all means get the larger size - otherwise I would get the 12 in to indulge in on my own.  Lots of other reviews mention the higher price point - but when you recognize the high level of quality ingredients used in each pie - they are right in line. You definitely get what you pay for! You can't compare other pizzas that have low quality ingredients or any other traditional American pizza w this place. Come and taste a True ITALIAN way of cooking and tasting.  Your tastebuds will thank you.",

We had the margarita and the pistachio. The staff is great, they are very proactive about coming to check on you, clearing your table and even asking if you want another beer, which is great considering it is a \"order at the register and take your number\" place.  We will definitely be back! Be careful walking in, the entrance to the restaurant is right by the entrance to the shopping center and people come FLYING in.",

    "text": "I had several problems with the place:  PRICE- 2 pizzas and one 16 oz Coke was $50 and when I paid with credit card, the girl turned the Ipad machine to me and asked if I wanted to add a tip. Unless you are cutting my food and stuffing it in my mouth, I am not going to give you a tip for walking a pizza 10 feet away to me at the table.  MENU: won't do toppings on only half the pizza, two meat topping limit even though they offer 4 kinds of meat toppings.  THE PIZZA: This pizza was a disgrace. The meat pizza was a soggy mess that left an pile of oil and grease on the paper plate (see my uploaded photos). The regular cheese pizza didn't have enough cheese on it. It only covered 15% of the pie, the rest was all sauce showing.   THE STAFF: We were asked on 3 separate occasions if we wanted more sauce to dip our crust in. How about this- why don't you figure out how to put together a pizza that has the correct ratio of dough to sauce to cheese!  Definitely not going back and definitely not recommending.  ADT'L NOTES AFTER JENNIFER OF INIZIO COMMENTED ON MY REVIEW: I appreciate Jennifer of Inizio correcting me on my size of Coke ordered, but that additional 4 ounces of soda still doesn't justify the $50 price tag. There are currently 12,500 Domino's Pizza stores. if no one liked their pizza, there simply wouldn't be that many stores open. I have visited Italy and have eaten pizza in Rome, Venice, Naples, Sorrento, and the Island of Capri and Inizio's pizza didn't taste like anything I ate in Italy. The taste of their pizza was pretty bland and very soggy. I stand by my review and am pretty clear with the issues of this restaurant. I didn't just say. 'this place is crap so don't there'. I took the time to itemize it with 4 problems areas and included photos. Yelp exists to give unbiased and honest reviews by people and I am entitled to my opinion. Jennifer's final sentence of \"You are definitely not the customer we want dining with us\" is definitely a buyer beware to future patrons on how they treat customers.  I have since had Jennifer send me a private message inviting me to Inizio for some free gelato! Last week you don't want me, this week you welcome me with open arms! When I messaged her about it, she replied that she meant to send that message to another Andrea on Yelp. The pizza was bad enough, now I have to deal with this foolishness.....",

Really everything at Inizio is delicious though. Their ingredients taste so fresh, and the crust is a perfect mix of soft/chewy with a little crisp. Also, do yourself a favor and get a cannoli for dessert.

Well, today I finally stopped in to try one of their signature pizzas. I ordered a 16-inch Margherita Pizza, with an additional topping of Pepperoni. As expected, the pizza was really good...perfectly thin, with a great crust, and a generous dose of pepperoni (almost too much?). Although I probably could have eaten all, I stopped myself after 3 slices, and boxed the rest to go.  Then came a happy surprise! One of the guys brought me another 16-inch pie, saying it's on the house...so I gladly took it! OMG...now I have enough pizza to last me for a week.   How can I NOT give 5 stars after all that??",

I wish it had been Wednesday night as their drafts are 3.50 then. Then on to the pizza. I was glad that's what we came for because that's all they offer other than salad. I decided to go with the diavali (sp?). It had a nice spicy flavor but was incredibly salty. I also tried the classic basil and mozzarella offering and was again underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong it was good, just not great. I can't help but compare it to Alino's and it just falls short. Beer section brings it from a 2 to a 3.",

They are now my go-to place for inventive, flavorful Neapolitan pizza. The crust is amazingly fluffy! And the cannoli is nice and light (not super creamy like i usually like mine), but the filling is never too sweet, the shell nice and crispy, the rotating flavors awesome!   They're always doing cool things with their pizza flavors: like pistachio, pumpkin, beet pesto, Limon capra, braised pork with peaches, the list goes on! They also have their classic pizzas that always stay on their menu. You honestly can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here -- they're so different and each pack their own type of flavor.   Service is very quick. They follow a strict guidelines for making their pizza, which includes the use of a wood-fired oven ( which cooks the pizza in 90 seconds), a naturally rising dough made with \"00\" flour, and San Marzano tomatoes and real buffalo milk mozzarella. You can really tell that the authentic ingredients set them apart as soon as you take a bite.",

    "text": "My first time here. I thought that the pizza was good.  I had the Pistachio pizza I enjoyed the nutty flavor of it and how the pistachios added a different texture.   You could tell that the dough was freshly made and it had a nice oven fired char to it. I got a small and it was enough to feed 2 people.   I don't think it is the best pizza I have ever tasted. If I went back I think I would get more of a classic flavor I was missing out on some of the regular flavors I am used to but wanted to try something different.   The customer service was great everyone was nice made eye contact with you, had a smile, and checked up on you from time to time.   I would recommend and definitely will be making my way back.",

    "text": "This review is based on 2 day old leftover margherita pizza, haha. My daughter went to Inizio's and brought home 2 slices Friday night. I heated them in the broiler for a couple minutes for breakfast today (this was 2 days later only because I was doing a 3 day program that didn't include pizza) and wow I can't wait to go there in person and see what the pizza tastes like when it's right out of the oven!! Even with the leftover pizza half heated I could taste the quality of the ingredients. The dough is chewy and slightly (perfectly) salty, sauce is simple and well seasoned, cheese light (no grease dripping off) and really tasty. One slice had a big leaf of basil, yum.   Comparing this pizza to a fast food chain (papa john's, etc) is really like comparing bananas to hot dogs. Similar shape, but that's where the similarities end. I read the reviews and understand people are concerned about the price, but you really do get what you pay for. The high quality non-GMO ingredients in Inizio's pizza are far more nourishing to our bodies than the overly processed (devoid of nutrients) crap the other guys use and it's quite filling. From the pics I saw posted, the pies look huge and I'd imagine 1 would easily feed 4 people, maybe with a little salad to go with.   Folks at Inizio's: Thank you for bringing high quality, superior pizza to our neighborhood! You're in good company with the Whole Foods going up down the road (YAY!!) and I'm sure my fellow Charloteans will be supporting you to great success. I might be seeing you for lunch today, lol.  Update May 2019: sad to report the quality of the food has gone down. Today pizza crust was extra burned. Left black residue all over the fingers and the pizza barely had any sauce.   Sat outside and the tables on the west end of the patio are beat! Wood is splintering and warped. One of the tables had been partially redone but the rest are in need of replacement/refurbishing.   It's obvious you guys are profitable as evidenced by how busy and expensive this place is. Please don't  assume people will continue to frequent your establishment if the quality for the food and the atmosphere are declining.   Desando is doing the same thing, is right up the road and is still brand new. Just sayin. Been coming here since day 1 and tryna support but got a bit turned off today.",

This location at the corner of Providence and Ballantyne Commons is definitely a great staple to have nearby.  The pizzas are always delicious... I usually stick with the staples, but their signature pizzas are good as well.  Staff are super nice... there are long bench tables and a couple high top tables for four in the dinning room.  Due to the location, there are limited patio seats, but at least they have a  few.  The shopping center is anchored by a Harris Teeter and a Lowe's, so the parking lot is definitely a busy one.",

Ordering was quick and easy, the place was crowded but a table opened up right away.  My family selected a pistachio pesto and a Luigi and neither disappointed.  The crust was really amazing and even the marinara sauce used to dip it in was beyond expectations.  The pizza is both soft and has a slight burn on the bottom which makes it crispy and super tasty.    You can tell the folks that work there take pride in their service; we were approached by 4 different employees during our meal who were very pleasant.    When my girlfriend mentioned she had never had a cannoli before (I know, right?  But she's awesome, trust me) a chef named Peter was walking by and just happened to overhear her.  Within a couple minutes he brought her one of the best cannolis I've ever had on the house.   It really made our night.  I know I'm gushing about this place, but I'm not usually excited to go straight back to a new restaurant... Inizio's is the real deal and their pies are pricey but worth every cent!",

Tried to get some food from them tonight and I call them asking to place a to-go order, first thing they say is, based on the inconvenience this places we no longer accept over the phone orders, but you can place it on our website or come in person. I tell the staff that I can understand that but am in their parking lot trying to put my baby to sleep. \"Oh ok, but we still can't accept a to-go order over the phone.\" Their loss, I went across the street to the other pizza place and got our food. What they didn't know is we were wanting to place a larger catering order this coming weekend, well, guess who isn't getting that business... ! If you going to have a pizza place, may want to learn some manners and customer service ;). The world doesn't revolve around your poor ethics and lack of want to accommodate customers.",

Took about 25 mins to get my order (doesn't it take 90 secs to cook these things?), even though it was 6 pm and they had maybe 5 people in the dining room. The pizza was sooo salty, almost unbearable. They will tell you it's from the prosciutto, but as a young man growing up in an Italian household, it's not supposed to be that darn salty. Crust was decent, not enough cheese or sauce. I might come back, but only if we had a coupon. Prices are not justifiable for the quality you receive.",

I ordered the Italian Chopped salad, but due to food sensitivities I asked that several items be left off.  I also asked if I could get prosciutto instead of the salami, since I was unsure what the salami was made with.  I would have paid extra.  The check out girl was very nice and seemed unsure how to ring it up, so she asked a manager for help.  He came over and helped her and very rudely told me that they could do it, but if I came again and they were busy, they wouldn't due any modifications.  Are you kidding me?!  It was a salad, I wasn't asking for an entree to be made a certain way.  I am a huge foodie and dine at a lot of restaurants all over Charlotte and have never been told something like that.  The pizza looked great and would have eaten there again with the family, but unfortunately I will never go back and I will let everyone I know, especially if they have food allergies, to stay away!  Horrible customer service!",

This is not your usual, thick crust pizza that one finds at the local neighborhood pizza place. No, this is an artisan pizza made with special flour, water, tomatoes, cheese, etc. The crust is much thinner and tastier than say Papa John's. Yes, your piece of pizza will sort of flop down.  On a recent visit to Charlotte, my husband and I were lucky enough to stop at Inizio Pizza Napoletan. WOW! What a great pizza. The taste was fresh and succulent. We went back a second time to try another pizza. We loved the Diavola, but be careful, it's hot, hot, hot and so yummy. We also tried the Margherita:  excellent, and the Napoletana. All of these were outstanding. On the first trip, we also shared the Caesar salad, very good, the lemon gelato (If you like lemon, this is the gelato for you), and the Red Velvet cheesecake:  to die for. We rolled out.   On our second trip to Inizio, two days later, in addition to the pizza, we tried the Caprese salad, very good, but the Caesar was our favorite, more gelato and a regular cheesecake. Once again, the food was fantastic, and we rolled on out back to our motel.  If you like good food and aren't afraid to try something new, Inizio Pizza Napoletana is the place to try. If Papa Murphy's is your idea of good pizza, then you probably should stay away.",

Yes, it is pricey, but you cannot experience this in any typical American pizzeria.  In Naples, you can get a similar pizza for 6-8 euros and a 1/2 liter of wine for 7 euros but we are not in Italy.

I tried two pies -- the traditional Margherita as well as the Pistacchio. Both featured crust that was cooked to perfection, with slight crisp to the outside while remaining chewy on the inside. The Margherita featured a delicious tomato sauce while the pesto sauce on the Pistacchio had the added unique crunch of finely chopped pistachio nuts. Both were topped with fresh mozzarella, and I found the balance of sauce to cheese to be just right. Dessert was also wonderful. It was too difficult to choose between the cannoli or gelato, so I tried both and was not disappointed (I particularly recommend the chocolate and hazelnut gelato!).  In addition to serving delicious food, Inizio also provides incredibly efficient and conscientious service. I was asked multiple times by everyone from the servers to the cooks how I was enjoying my meal. The kindness of the Inizio team combined with the excellent meal ensured that I will be a return guest!",

Their Italian sausage was incredible. I did not have room for the gelato but I saw several customers who seemingly were very content with it. My only complaint is the pizzas are massive and there is only one size to buy. Awesome if you have a group that can agree on one or two to share. But it is going to be an undertaking for two people and needs to be some sort of eating competition for one person. But they are served fast thanks to the Naples Italy style of cooking them. Friendly staff too.",

I love that they have like cucumber water and stuff like that, it's perfect! The girl greeted us and explained the menu to us when we first came in.

We tried the pepperoni and the margherita.  They were flavored very well and the red sauce was not too bitter or acidic, which I hate!  It wasn't too greasy, it wasn't too sloppy, it was the perfect crust and great flavoring.  It was fun to watch them literally create the pizza (dough and all) right in front of me.    I love the fact that you can buy a glass or bottle of wine while dining at one of their family-style tables and you can finish your meal with some of their scrumptious gelato.  Great addition to Charlotte.  The location isn't my favorite and wolfman pizza used to be in this exact location so that concerns me as far as their success is concerned.  But, I think they have what it takes to keep people coming back!  I highly recommend!",

    "text": "I'm glad this place is a serious hike from my house, otherwise I'd be tempted to go more often.  The atmosphere is great.  Nice, but super casual so you don't feel bad having kids in there.  There are long communal picnic style tables, so if you have a big party like we did, you'd better go during an off time.  It was crazy busy on a Friday night at 6:30, despite the crazy torrential downpour of rain.    Things to note: Limited menu.  One size of pizza (large).  Prices are a bit on the high end ($22 for my Pistachio Pizza). All bottled drinks (no fountain), and no table service.  Get in line as soon as you walk in the door, order your food and take a number to an open table.  While there's technically no table service, there are a TON of employees walking around cleaning up and asking if you need anything else.    The food was really good.  As mentioned in other reviews, the PISTACHIO PIZZA is their specialty and very tasty.  I'm really particular on pizza.  If I'm wasting calories, I want it to be worth it.  This fell into the category of \"worth it.\"  Instead of red sauce, the base is a pistachio pesto, with mozzarella and ricotta on top.  I needed a ton of salt & pepper, but that's typical for my taste buds.  When I return, I'll order the next one with light cheese, as I find the standard amount of cheese to be too much and too greasy.  And lighter cheese just might make the bottom a little crispier.  It's impossible to get a crisp crust when you have a ton of sauce, cheese or toppings.  The dough was soft and pillowy on the edges while still being thin in the middle and having a touch of crisp.  I liked that the pizza was served with a small container of red sauce for dipping the crust.    My husband ordered the CHOPPED SALAD and found it very filling.  It had plenty of meat (salami? other cold cuts?) and a variety of vegetables.  The house dressing was tasty and overall he was satisfied (not easy when ordering a salad for a meal).    The GELATO was interesting.  I liked the SALTED CARAMEL GELATO best out of the three flavors I tried (chocolate chip - bland; and hazelnut - odd).  My only complaint is that it was too melty even straight out of the freezer.  The CANNOLI was pretty standard. Nothing super special and nothing bad.  I like the cannoli cream to be a touch sweeter, but that's just my personal preference.    Overall, this was a great choice for a family dinner with a bunch of friends and their kids.  We liked the food, the service & the atmosphere, and I will definitely go back.",

Even with a delivery service their pizza are not compromised. They pay attention to details and don't cut corners like some others do. Inizio is the best, authentic pizza I've ever had. FYI-I tested the margherita pizza here and at another place up the road to be fair. Inizio won in my house, hands down!   Looking forward to coming back!",

    "text": "Passable but not better. We tried the \"Margherita\" and the Pistachio - $33 with a bottle of water. The crust was pretty good, and the mozzarella excellent but it ends there.   The so called Margarita tasted OK, but really bland. No fresh tomatoes just a tomato sauce which tasted exactly what it was : canned stewed tomatoes with little if any seasoning other than sugar. Secret ingredients [ rolls eyes ] right!  The only flavoring was a tiny leaf of basil on each slice.  The pistachio one was \"interesting\" but would I order it again: no. I found it more palatable with a heavy sprinkling of black pepper and grated parmesan to counter the oil.   I honestly don't know why so many rave about this place, iMO it's not even close to the hype.",

Pistachio is amazing. Sounds odd, but try it. You really can't go wrong with the choices here.  I tend to go weekdays during the lunch and stuff comes out very quickly. I am thinking 10 minutes for a pizza.  I am disappointed they also shrank their desert offerings. Loved me that cheesecake.",

Not only that, their decor is rustic, hip, and exceptionally photogenic.   Once you walk in, you order and pay at the counter, then take a seat wherever you want. Water, plates, etc is also self-serve at Inizio.   On my first visit, I tried the Pistachio pizza and one of their seasonal cannolis (at that time it was pumpkin). Both was incredibly delicious! Love the crust of the pizza and the cannoli filling was so creamy!   Can't wait to come back and try the gelato and their other pizzas! Also, the prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes. The \"personal\" size pizza was well enough for 2 (or maybe 3 if you guys are small eaters). Also check out their weekly specials for their drink promos are very good.",

I loved the combo of fresh ricotta with the mozzarella. The pesto was garlicky and accented by a lovely crunch from the pistachios. What really makes the pizza is the crust, soft, chewy, fluffy with a floral olive oil flavor and a nicely subtle crunch from the oven. If you don't like eating the crust of your pizza don't go to Inizio because that would be a sad, sad waste of seriously the best part of this pizza. I loved the long wooden tables, abundance of red pepper flakes, the dessert case with cheesecake and cannoli, and watching the pizza making process from the dough room to the 900 degree ovens. I was surprised to note that the location was in a plaza beside a grocery store but stepping inside you wouldn't know it. This is a great spot to go alone, for a date or a night out with friends or family. Great for anyone who likes good pizza!",

    "text": "Good pizza and fabulous customer service.  We had dinner here on a Friday night.  We got there at 5:30 and it was already busy.  That's a good sign but unfortunately since it is so popular we felt like we couldn't leisurely eat our pizza with people standing waiting for a table.    We ordered a margarita pizza with mushrooms, one Pinot Grigio, one beer and one sparkling water.  Total of $48 which included a 20% tip.  Not crazy expensive but also not cheap if that's what you are looking for.  The pizza tasted like everything was super fresh and of really high quality so I think it's definitely worth the price.  Asking for a tip when you wait in line to order and then get your own utensils, plates, etc seems kind of weird to me but since you are prompted I gave them 20% even though I had no idea how the service would be.   Not a big deal, just a little strange.    Right after our pizza came out one of the managers (maybe owner?) came over and asked if we liked cannoli's.  Of course we said yes, who doesn't like cannoli's!?  Anyway, he said he wanted to give us a free cannoli because he saw our pizza come out and it was smaller than he likes them to be.  So needless to say, we were pretty impressed with their customer service.  For what it's worth, it was a bit smaller than the other pizzas that we saw but was still plenty of food for two people.   We wrapped the cannoli and had it later that night.  Holy amazing.   It was exactly how I like my cannoli, not too sweet.   As other reviewers have noted, it's a specific Neopolitan style of pizza and you have to like that style.  Even though it's not my favorite style, it was still pretty delicious and as noted earlier, super fresh with high quality ingredients. It would be hard to get me to stray from my regular favorite pizza place, True Crafted but we will probably be back when we feel like something different.",

Great service, friendly, considerate   HOWEVER...cons,  there was more surrounding crust than actual pizza as a whole, the main pizza crust with all of the neopolitana ingredients on it was sooooooo this ot was slimy and limp.  It leaves you less full than a traditional pizza and I would say because of this the 16 inch is only good for 2 people who like surrounding crust because if you do not eat any of the surrounding crust you will starve!  So in the end, will this be my go to to get filling pizza frequently? NO  BUT it will be my go to when I'm craving the \"TASTE\" of home",

Indoor and outdoor seating is both very inviting. The margherita pizza was a solidly good pie and we ordered a dish of pepperoni on the side, which was delicious! The dressing on the arugula salad was light and crisp and refreshing with just the right amount of tart. Thursday $2.00 small gelato night was an extra bonus. Have been wishing for an authentic pizza place with fresh ingredients and a real deal feel - this fits the bill. In my opinion the pizza was definitely more flavorful than Alino's and not nearly as thin/soggy (even though this pizza is thin, too.) Will DEFINITELY be back to Inizio's!",

Now I am from Chicago so that means I have a different palate than the southerners down here for Pizza....This is Not Chicago Pizza..this is TRUE AUTHENTIC  PIZZA from Italy. The Crust is where we will start..Outstanding. made with a perfect flour .Love the wood fired flavor! The toppings..I think I am sitting in a cafe in the  Mediterranean ordering the toppings I love!  The Pistachio pesto is superb! The Fresh Ricotta - just like Grandma Annuziata's . We sampled three of the Pizzas - we loved them all! The condiment bar is great with Olive Oil --fresh and tasty with hot oil also..some lovely flavored water.  Spicy Hot peppers and  Pecorino Cheese add to the choices! The staff is very accommodating. Anything you need they will get you!  The salads are a meal in themselves with the Arugula being my favorite!  Great selection of Craft Beers and wine. But the outstanding thing is ---when you get to the end there is Gelato...Now it is expensive but in this case you get what you pay for ! It is lovely and flavorful! We had to take it home..we were stuffed from the great pizza and salad..but do not under any circumstance leave without the Gelato...Salted Caramel and Coffee, my favorites! Can't believe I am this lucky to have it right next to my Harry Teeters!! GO...really...Go!",

Arugula salad was so fresh, the parmigiana cut perfect, the cherry tomatoes fantastic. My judge of a pizza place is the margherita, not even a piece of crust left on the tray. My wife favorite pizza in Italy is the capricciosa, she took the last piece from me with a smile saying sorry it's mine.",

The bread had no real crunch and was a bit chewy. Nothing like you will find in any area of Italy I have been. The guys at Portofina from Naples make a better pie. The salad her however was superior.   For the price, a pizza place should have decent pizza.",

The restaurant had a nice ambience, the employees were friendly and most importantly the pizza was quite delicious. It tasted fresh and the crust was perfect, although I bet it could have been cooked even a touch longer to make it crispier. They cooked super fast bc of their Italian ovens (which I asked to see #nerdalert, I know, but they are so cool!) I'm a very picky pizza eater (from NJ, it's part of my makeup) and my only complaint about this restaurant is that it's not closer to my house! I'll definitely be back.",

The pesto and rosemary flavors are spectacular. Only comment would be the crust was a little underdone for my tastes - like it nice and crispy and this still had a little dough-iness to it. But a minor detail. Definitely will return.",

    "text": "We were a little surprised to find out that we couldn't order our pizza over the phone, but quickly understood once we got there that our pizza would've been sitting and getting cold had we done that. They claim to have your pizza ready within a couple minutes of ordering, but it took them a little more than five minutes to get our pizza done the evening we came in. Still had no complaints about that because we much preferred to take home a piping hot, right out of the oven pizza. The margherita pizza was delicious and held up well on the trip home. It reminded us of the pizza we had in Rome years ago -  Nice thin crust that is both soft and crispy. It had a good amount of cheese on it, although I would've preferred a little more cheese but I do love love love cheese!  Where they fell short was with the Caesar salad. It was mostly Romaine lettuce with very little shaved Parmesan cheese and minimal croutons. We could hardly taste any of the Parmesan flavor and it definitely needed more croutons. I would've preferred a Panera Caesar salad over this, even with the Parmesan chips because you got actual Parmesan flavor.  We ordered a plain NY style cheesecake and a red velvet cheesecake, and enjoyed both. I preferred the plain, but my husband ate most of the red velvet. Both were very good! We'll definitely be back and next time we'll eat there. They had ample, open seating with a view into the kitchen. They had a few community tables with benches and some indivisible high tops. We may try one of the beers on tap, a different salad and the pistachio pizza was intriguing. Check it out!",
