Today, my husband and I decided to give it a go for lunch. DELISH! We got a side order of meatballs as an appetizer and I could have literally ate them as a meal. So good. Sauce is to die for. We both got a sub...he got the turkey and I got the veal. They were very filling and both were tasty. I wish they had other side options as our only choice was chips, but other than that we had no complaints. Our server was friendly and happy, our beer was cold and our food was scrumptious! We will def go back.",

I finally decided to give it a try one night when I was looking for a certain type of pizza, totally greasy and bad for you. Well this place hit the spot of exactly what I was looking for.  I went in to place my order since it was the first time I had ordered from them and honestly the inside did not impress me, in fact it made me a little worried even. With that said I don't know that I would take the time to go in and eat but I will probably be ordering to go from here a lot in the future.  I ordered a large pizza with pineapple, half with jalapeno and the other half with black olives and it hit the spot. I think next time I will get light on the sauce as I am not a huge fan of sauce but it was exactly what I was looking for. I also ordered the mozzarella sticks which were just frozen and fried, don't know that I will get those again but the pizza I will for sure!",

    "text": "If you like \"old school\" pizza and sub joints (not decorated by some MBA, pastel vinyl freak), this is your place. It sits on Central Ave, just over the Eastway intersection (heading towards town), on the left. The neighborhood demographic is changing, so it's become a little out of place (yes, that's an OOB Waffle House next door and a Hispanic Western Wear a couple doors down).  I have an indecent love for their cheese steaks and Greek subs. I alternate between the two most of the time. I've had their pasta (great) and their pizza (also great), but the subs are what I keep coming back for.  Being a True \"Child of the South\", I won't try to compare the cheese steaks to anything from where you used to live up North. All I know is I like them as well as any I've found in CLT. Loads of meat (with just the right amount of what I like to pretend is just \"juice\"), onions, and cheese. The meat has a hint of (Greek?) seasoning which I suspect gets put into everything in the place. Served with rippled chips and a pickle spear.  The Greek sub is another thing altogether. Roast beef and other cold-cuts on a hoagie bun, oozing with some mysterious sauce which is apparently the result of an evil lab experiment directed at completely dominating my waistline.  I alternate between the two, and there is always a mental tug of war over the choice.  There have been a lot of cigarettes smoked, beers drank, and pizzas sliced in this place over the years. Decor is pretty much unchanged from when your parents went on dates here. They have a jukebox and daily specials.  In my bachelor days, \"House of Pizza\" was one of my regular haunts. Since getting married and moving to the other side of town, I don't get in there as often as I should.  NOT A CHAIN, LOCALLY OWNED, GOOD FOOD. If you need a more corporate experience, there's an Olive Garden on Independence. Shame on you if you miss this place, though.",

    "text": "GREEK PIZZA. You must try it. I am obsessed with it; I moved to the East side a few months ago and was intrigued by the packed parking lot HOP always seems to have going. Then I tried the Greek Pizza and learned why. The crust was a bit thick but perfectly chewy; the feta cheese, if not house-made, was at least made by someone who knows what they're doing. Creamy, a bit of that rind taste I love, and the fresh onion, fresh green bellpepper toppings were the right note to play off the grilled lamb gyro meat. It's the only pie I've tried so far, because when I walk in the door I can't make my mouth say anything else. I may be able to see other pizzas soon, but right now I am completely infatuated. Oh yeah, old school decor, blah blah blah. GREEK PIZZA.",

They've been here forever, and walking inside feels like time travel (in all the good ways). With specialties in pizza and subs, with Greek influences sprinkled in (like any good restaurant in the QC), you need to get to House of Pizza. Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it.  I've not tried the sandwiches yet (next visit), but the pizza is incredible. The sauce has great flavor but doesn't overpower, and they are generous with the toppings. Now, I'm not a fan of the floppy, ends-up-in-your-lap NY style pizza. House of Pizza has those big slices, but the crusty is substantial to support all the goodies on top. Finally, someone who gets what a crust should be!  The people who work here are absolutely great. The whole place feels like sitting in a relative's kitchen. One of the best pizza places in Charlotte, hands down.",

The service was awesome (despite the two women working being a little overwhelmed by the never ending lunch crowd), the prices were decent, and the decor was bad ass... but the pizza, as advertised for on their huge, often-burnt-out neon piece dangling over Central, was pretty bad. Of course, we were the only people ordering it. Everyone else went with the house meat+cheese+white bread sub, served, interestingly, with BJ's-looking potato chips.  So was our tzatziki. Eh. Interesting execution of this Greek dip/sauce: sour creamish yogurt, shredded cuke, raw garlic. No herbs, pepper, salt. Turned out that this was the best part of the meal, and I enjoyed dipping something as weird as crappy chips into it and actually having them improve the taste.  Pluses include: $8 pasta specials that include garlic toast and salad, with a number of veg-friendly options. I might come back to try one of these lasagnas or raviolis or manicottis. But for pizza, I will head 'round the corner to Portofino's. Definitely.",

You could drive by every day for a year and never notice it.  when you step  inside, though, it is like stepping into a time machine.  The walls are wood paneled, everything looks like it might've been fancy twenty years ago,and the placemats are paper.  I think they forgot to give us our crayons.  I had a witty comment about the wall art, but I forgot what it looked like.  It's that kind of place.  Anyway, on to the positives.  Our waitress was really, really nice.  The prices are nice and low, too. The entrees are in the nine-twelve dollar range (don't quote me), and come with a salad and garlic bread.  I decided I couldn't go wrong with lasagna and was pleasantly surprised.  It was flavorful and did not have a cookie cutter taste.  the portion size was more than ample and there is a wide selection of cheap wine to choose from.  I guess it was kind of like eating at the genesis of Macaroni Grill.  When you take into account quality, price, atmosphere, and quantity The House of Pizza is a  solid value.  I'd go again.... if someone asked me to.  Maybe.",

Apparently our friends who brought us here have never even tried their pizza and they used to frequently order from this place when they lived nearby. i for one was very satisfied with my decision. i ordered the lasagna which comes with a salad and garlic bread. The salad is bare bones with lettuce, peppers, a tomato, onions and dressing. The lasagna was delightful. There was no burnt edges, just perfectly cooked as promised. Rather than just a slice of garlic bread, it is really more like a small loaf of garlic bread. It was perfect for making little lasagna sandwich bites with the garlic bread that i so thoroughly enjoy doing. Why don't Italian places offer a lasagna sandwich? or do they?  As far as draft beer choices: Budweiser....and Budweiser.  That's it. Figured what the hell, haven't done the Bud Heavy in years. For $2.25, it came in an overly frozen/frosted little mug. It worked.",

I admit, it spiked my curiosity enough to try it, even though we've passed by it regularly over the past few years and never had the urge before.  We walked in, super excited to try out this amazing pizza.  The prices seemed a little steep, but for the best pizza, it must be worth it... so we ordered a medium all veggie pizza.    When it came out and we saw the way the cheese looked and smelled, we just looked at each other in doubt, but still had high hopes and took our first bites.  After all, the cheese was soooooo thick it must be good.  After the first bite, Ben immediately exclaimed, \"was that girl HIGH when she ate this pizza?\"  I thought it tasted frozen... like something from a high school cafeteria... and the cheese had no flavor.  The mushrooms were canned and there was hardly any sauce.  I have no idea who would ever think this pizza is the best in the whole wide world... maybe it's all a matter of taste... but we are completely flabbergasted.   After discussing for a while what we were eating, we looked around and realized that no one else in the entire place was eating pizza.  The subs looked super popular and everyone seemed happy.  I don't think we ever even finished our leftovers.  I hate giving a place 1 stars, and recently I read on a friend's facebook update that they had just discovered HOP and couldn't believe that they had gone their whole lives in this neighborhood without having ever tried it.  They also thought it was amazing.  Again, we were completely baffled!  So, apparently it's a taste preference... but be warned.",

The spaghetti is great, the lasagna is delicious, the pizza ironically is so so. ( not bad at all, but not awesome)   Third is that this is a local restaurant, and not a Chain.

Look in the photos and you will see a chicken wing next to a sugar packet. The sugar packet is bigger than the chicken wing. In my entire life I have never seen wings this small. Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!

    "text": "This restaurant as I always saw it was a gem in Charlotte. Not much people know about it, but does it attract people from all around. One time I saw a Huntersville Police come down to this restaurant. I don't blame them taking that trip to taste their delicious subs.  I'm not a big fan of their pizza, but I will eat their subs daily if I could. I always order the Mushroom Steak or their Combination Steak subs which come with a melted cheese sub with mushrooms and steak with peppers (combination steak) and chips. I wish I could substitute the chips with something like a salad or something, but I'm not going to complain. The salad here is the freshest in all the restaurants I have ever eaten at. The house salad is always crisp and just taste wonderful with the  green peppers and baby tomatoes they add.  Every bite of their sub was an experience for me. The service is nice, but when it gets hectic in the restaurant you have to give them a little break. Inside, they have dimmed lights also with a big old style radio player (that plays really old music every 15-30 min). Overall, I love this place. It's not too far from my house and it's absolutely delicious.",

Maybe it's the homey atmosphere, maybe it's the food that's so good you want to hug it, maybe it's the waiters so cute you want to hug them. This is definitely one of Charlotte's hidden gems.  On the surface, it's not much to brag about, but the food more than makes up for it. From pizza and sandwiches, to Greek favorites like gyros and spanikopita, to desserts, you can't go wrong. And it's so low-priced you might as well get one of everything. Definitely a winner in my book!",

Being primarily pizza eaters, we haven't tried all of the menu items, but the famous philly cheese steak sub is awesome. The lasagna is good too.

The help stood around talking until I told the gentleman behind me that the reason I wasn't moving was because of the \"Wait to be seated\" sign. That got the helps attention although the restaurant didn't appear to be busy, maybe 3 tables with people at them. I was seated and placed my order of a Pastrami sub and iced tea. 25 minutes later, (I was on a lunch break from work,) my sub came out with chopped meat..I ordered pastrami so I'll say it was pastrami. . This chopped meat had little to no flavor and no moisture...dry as dust. the only moisture in the entire sub was the mustard and whatever drops of water that were on the lettuce. The waitress was nonexistent and I was out of tea for over 10 minutes. I never saw her again until she brought the food. This place used to be good and maybe I caught them on a bad day but it'll be awhile before I go back, if then.",

It really did remind of pizza places from back when I was a kid. The other thing I really liked about it was that it was very different form a chain pizza place.   We ordered the house special pizza and it was great. The crust is a little on the thick side, but not as thick as a pan pizza. It is nice and crispy and there are very generous portions of toppings and cheese. I thought the pizza was priced very reasonably (~$17 for a large).   My brother in law told me he used to have little league banquets here over 30 years ago. It is great a place can stay in business that long and serve consistently good food.

The waitress was young and hated her job. I ordered eggplant parm. The wife had a small veggie pizza. Both if us got salads. This was quite possibly the most underwhelming meal I have ever had. The price was overwhelming. Over 36.00 is what they wanted for 10.00 worth of food. As George Bush said \"fool me once shame on you, you'll never fool me again.\"",

I have no idea what they put in the crust, but I really liked it. Slightly chewy with sweet and savory notes -- different and it totally works with the pizza.  I ordered the Greek pizza, and it was awesome!! I was craving a gyro and pizza, but couldn't decide between the two... This was the perfect option.  Super cheesy, lots of awsome toppings, and the perfect balance of meat with olives, green peppers, and feta.  The only thing that I can say is that it was definitely more of a \"fork and knife\" kind of pizza -- not a thin foldable slice lol.  In any event, we will definitely be back whenever we crave good old fashioned cheesy down home pizza!",

It doesn't look all that great in all honesty but it tastes pretty darn good. They don't skimp on cheese (though sauce is lacking a bit)..so it works for us. Now this isn't the best pizza in the world but it certainly isn't the worst. A pie will set you back like $11 for cheese so you can't beat the price.",

(Keep in mind they have been packed since reopening and our wait was long).  I give the bacon sub a 5 Star all the way. Bread was good and tasty. Cheese was ample. Bacon was good and done (not limp) but not too crispy. Had good flavor. Loved shredded lettuce on it. All in all a great sub. The lasagna was thick, with lots of noodles, not overly sauced, might could have used a touch more shredded cheese. It had a good flavor - not the beat I have had, but better than many. The pizza - well here ya go. Crust was flavorful, done just right and no grease seepage from the sauce or toppings (I like that). We asked for lite on the sauce and they were spot on. Plenty of cheese. We ordered pepperoni, sausage and black olives. Plenty of black olives. I'm not convinced I care for the sliced sausage. Pepperoni was flavorful and good.  As with all restaurants, there will be good and bad. We enjoyed it enough we will be returning soon.",

    "text": "I ordered a large cheese steak, with mushrooms, onions, and peppers.   House of Pizza's large cheese steak is a LLLLLARGEEEEEE sandwich. The combo comes with ruffled potato chips.  The large cheese steak is almost $10, which is acceptable given the size and quality.  Service is pretty good, but not exceptional. I ordered a Diet Pepsi and my waitress brought me an iced tea. {shrug} I got this corrected without any drama.  They were good about keeping beverages refilled, which is my major pet peeve. They were also good at bussing and cleaning the tables when diner's left.   The kitchen was generous with the steak and the mozzarella cheese atop the sandwich. They were also ample amounts of peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The bread was nice and crusty on the outside and tender in the middle.....really delicious. It was a VERY satisfying sandwich for a cheese steak lover.   They include mayonnaise on their cheese steak, which is definitely not traditional. I didn't have any problem with that.   Advice: - Hot cherry peppers hoagie spread,\" would add flavor and spice to their cheese steaks. It is available in every grocery store. - They need to add a little salt and pepper to the steak as it is being cooked. - I would have appreciated some garlic powder on the tables or sauteed crushed garlic in the cooked meat. It makes the sandwich mo better. ;o)  The men's bathroom? Gross.   There was also no room in the men's restroom for anyone with a wheelchair, which bothers me.   Current sanitation rating as of 4/11/2015 = 94.5%",

We had a fairly new waitress I'm not gonna name her name because she was super sweet and fabulous... She didn't have the rhythm down yet but it's understandable. I had ordered chicken Parmesan with white sauce on the pasta... It didn't come out correctly but I said no worries just bring me out some white sauce and I'll pour it on there and mix it it's fine... Got my white sauce thoroughly enjoyed eating catching up with my sister... I have never gotten my salad so I just asked her to put it in a to go box which she did ...My sisters food was incorrect also...She was new so we did not make a big deal of it. Definitely regret not sending our food back  When it was time to get my check I noticed that they charged me $2.50 for the white sauce that was supposed to be on my pasta. Not a problem I showed her and she said she was going to have It taken off. She never brought back an itemized ticket but she told me she took the offending I am off and that would be the only time they would do that because you cannot substitute sauce... I handed her my card and when she brought back the receipt the bill has gone up rather than down. I asked her for an itemized receipt and they could not produce one. Then they tried to say that they accidentally charged me for my sisters side of sauce... The problem is on my sisters receipt they had charged her for the sides of sauce  I personally think that they did not take the white sauce off and also added the dollar for a side of meat sauce that my sister got...  It was really really disappointing because I had been looking forward to coming to House of Pizza for so long. I hope they get all the stuff worked out because if it happens again I will definitely not continue my patronage. It might not seem like much but three or four dollars for me might be the difference between me having lunch one day or not...I have to juggle money around when I go out and get something to eat.  I sure hope this does not happen again.",

The pie was cheesy and delicious. The wings were crispy, well sauced and tasty. The salad was basic and fresh. It's the house dressing which makes it special.  Next time I will try the Philly Cheese Steak everyone raves about. Several people were eating them and they looked yummy.",

The service was really slow so we were waiting a long time to order even though it wasn't super packed at first  . Our waitress wasn't very attentive. She bought out two regular lasagnas instead of a veggie one that I ordered . The lasagna however was pretty good. I can do away with the garlic bread. I thought the price (11.25) was decent for your entree , a salad and garlic bread  plus a dollar for cheese on my salad. I'll go back, I just don't expect great service .",

First I will say that the facility is definitely improved. More tables and much cleaner! But I guess I am nostalgic for the old place. Ordered Pizza-Pepperoni and half Sausage- tasted very similar as I remember but seemed much greasier than I remember. I thought it was decent but my wife was not a fan at all. Regardless, I have such wonderful memories of the House, that I will always be a fan. Maybe I'll get a Meatball Parm on my next visit.",

The service was horrible. The waitress suggested that we try a new menu items fresh made pita bread and greek dip. We waited 20 minutes and when we asked she said it would be a few minutes. That's not the bad part, she tried to hurry and put the order in. I had to tell her that we would rather not wait.   The pizza was hot and just like I remember from eating here as a child.  So if its good fast service is what you're after you might need to just pick up your order and skip the dine in experience.",

Usually go to portifino's but never ever again(see review to find out why).   Anyway me and my brother decided to try it out. Very packed. Limited parking. Parked on the side of the building. Went around 7pm on a Saturday I believe. Very old looking place. Bathroom was very small. Looks like a locker room bathroom. 2 small stalls barely enough room to wash your hands.   Everywhere looked dingy but not dirty I guess. Sn: Always Wash your hands after ordering. Menus are gross. Table and menu were kind of sticky. Seats weren't that much cleaner. Maybe it was a busy night for them. No paper towels in the bathroom had to use a napkin I had in my bag to open the door after drying my hands with the oldest hand dryer ever. Another side note: never touch public door handles with your bare hands esp in the restroom(e.coli is hella real). Call me weird but I never get sick and I'm a nurse(we are all a little weird I think lol). Anyway...  Salad was horrible. Didn't touch it. See pics. The bottle that the dressing came in...Omg.  Didn't look clean at all. Maybe keeps getting Refilled but not cleaned. Chicken Alfredo was bland and way too much Alfredo sauce for my liking. Garlic bread was ok(I make better way better). My brother ordered a Philly. Both entrees were not so good.   Ordered a large pizza to go for my little cousins. I ate a slice on the way there(Barely ate my food so I was hungry) and Omg it was so delish. I guess we both ordered wrong. The pizza was where it was at! Hence the name. I guess I'll get pizza next time.   Had I known about their pizza I would have stopped going to the other pizzeria down the road a long time ago. The location is very homely and sketchy looking But that's usually where you get the best food. The Pizza was very good! And I really love pizza. Maybe too much.   The server was ok. She checked on us and the food came out quick. Reminds me of Waffle House staff(I love Waffle House but we all know the people there can be pretty interesting). Just random looking people if you know what I mean. From what I can see the front was clean and they have a good score. So I would def go back. But only for the pizza and nothing else.",

Highlights: - we had great service. Everyone was nice and friendly. - prices were very reasonable and you got a ton of food for a low price - the sweet tea was good and they kept it coming - the house vinaigrette was good. Kinda sweet but pretty good.   Lowlights can be summed up in one word - FOOD: - the house salad came with lettuce, onion, green pepper and tomato. I wish there had been croutons or something to mix up the textures.  - the food in general was just not great. I had the chicken parmesan and the marinara sauce didn't have any robust flavors. The chicken didn't taste fresh. There was (and some people may think I'm crazy) way too much cheese on the chicken. I had to scrape most of it off. I literally had three bites of the meal and was done. Even my garlic bread didn't have a strong garlic taste. My fella had the cheesesteak (which the waitress described as \"awesome\") but the bite I had was bland. In my opinion- the philly cheesesteaks at Jersey Mike's on East Blvd are much, much, MUCH better.   I've eaten at worse places. But I've definitely eaten at better. If we ever go here again, I'd opt for the pizza and hope for better flavor.",

I do not like the primitive way they write out tickets you can't read them and it feels like the owner just rings up whatever!!  Not to mention how uncomfortable I was the out dated and sardine can feeling bathrooms!!",

    "text": "There's a part of me that wants to give this restaurant like a 2, and part of me that wants to give it a 5. It's great for what it's great for, but you should be aware when you're going to hit this place that it's a particular type of Italian food that I like to refer to as \"ghetto Italian.\"   It's kind of like the Italian food you'd make at home, but slightly better. I haven't had their pizzas, but I've had their veggie lasagna and a few other pasta dishes. They are always delicious, but not date-night, wearing your stilettos delicious. They are delicious in the, \"Hey, I just was shopping at Wal-Mart and I'd like to pig out on a huge lasagna\" kind of way.  The service is pretty fast, the decor is pretty cheesy, and the food is solid. It's worth investigating...and it's the kind of place I come back to again and again, without really meaning to. It's just there, and the hot ravioli calls to me like a beacon in the night.",

    "text": "House of Pizza is just like your favorite pizza, pasta, and sub joint from childhood, right down to the gaudy, dated decor.  I had not  yet found a really good pizza parlor in Charlotte in four years of living here, but I think I just did yesterday.  I like big portions, extra cheese, and images of the Parthenon and old school Jesus at my pizza parlor, so I'm giving my excursion to H.O.P. 4.5 stars!  The restaurant occupies a weathered building on Central and Eastway-where restaurants can be real hits or real misses.   I was a little worried about the quality when I scoped out the interior.  But I was quickly seated and my order was taken a minute or two later-a house salad with ranch dressing and a personal pan pizza with Italian sausage.  Check 1 for good service.  They didn't skimp on the dressing like more frou frou restaurants and the lettuce was still crisp; check 2. Then they brough out my pan pizza-hot, covered in a quarter inch of gooey mozzarella, homemade sauce, and real Italian sausage (not that freeze dried matter you get at Domino's).  Mamma mia, I'm marrying an Italian girl one day!!!  My waitress made sure my Diet Pepsi was refilled and my food was satisfactory.  My bill came up to $13, so I walked away fat and happy. Check 3, 4, 5, and 6!!!   Based on other Yelpers, the subs are equally good.  I guess I'll be flipping a coin on my next visit.  If you miss the days before pizza became a culinary craft, you'll fall in love with this vintage pizza joint.  I know that its going on my \"circuit\" of comfort food joints.",

    "text": "Pizza is great here, so is the service.  The place is owned by Italian natives who really know how to cook up a pizza pie!  Dan and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was hopping, but we didn't have to wait.  Our server was a young Italian woman who made us feel very at home.  We never had to wait for her to refill our drinks and the pizza was made within ten minutes.  I am a vegetarian and Dan isn't, but there was no problem splitting two toppings on each side with no extra charge.  The cheese was scruptous and fresh, and we didn't leave a slice behind.    Pictures of Italy decked the walls and the waitresses talked amongst one another in a sultry Italian tongue.  It really was an authentic Italian dining experience!",

I live in another state now but when I visit Charlotte this is one of my must stops and I am never ever disappointed! Thank you, House of Pizza for being an amazing constant source of great good and fond memories!",

I also tried the lasagna and thought it was almost as good as mine...almost.  Cheap beers (if you've read my reviews, you know this is VERY important) and super fast and friendly service round this place out.",

It was a HOT July evening in the Queen City and so the wife and I decided to cool off by going to a Greek pizza joint and getting HOT food.  Choo godda poblem widdat??   As others have said, the meatball sub and the steak sub seemed to be the signature items.  Meatball sub was a bit salty and it was overflowing with meat and cheese.  At first all I could see was cheese but then the cheese seemed to vanish in front of me and I actually wanted more cheese (must have been the heat, it was a HOT day).  Went through two soda pops because it's HOT in Charlotte in July. Wife really liked the steak sub.  All in all, it was a satisfying meal.  Good people watching too.  We were in and out in 30 minutes and for under $20.  And when we got outside it was still very HOT.  We really enjoyed the HOT of PIZZA and all the HOT food they serve.  Oh my freakin' lord, it is so very HOT in Charlotte in July.",
