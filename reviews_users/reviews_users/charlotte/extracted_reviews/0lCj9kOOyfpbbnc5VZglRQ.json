I got the zucchini spaghetti eggplant meatballs and they were heaven, they were so good I am returning tomorrow to get it again. Also their beer ginger lemonade was to die for, I would return for simply the drink. The employees were extremely nice and were recommending great meals and had us try the drinks and it was just overall amazing.",

Excellent flavor. Also had eggplant meatballs which sounded risky but they were incredible. You definitely pay a premium here but you're getting a much higher quality meal so it's worth the additional expense.",

There are many healthy yet great tasting choices here and that is very welcoming to me. I must say that the fact that they also have a few (3, I think) wine selections makes it more enticing. I'll be back.",

We were not made to feel bad or uncomfortable about it, the team here is wonderful and accommodating and we really appreciated that.",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to hear that b.good had a Charlotte location since I'm originally from the New England area and always enjoyed eating at b.good because of their farm to table concept when I lived there. Sad to say my experience at the b.good in ballantyne wasn't as good as I hoped and I don't think I'll be returning. First we ordered turkey burgers with fries and a drinks.   Positives....The burgers were good, fries were decent however not as good as I remember them to be and their rosemary lemonade was excellent just as I remember it.   Negatives....They served the burgers before they brought out the fries so we had to wait on the fries and by the time the fries came out the burgers were cold. Also the girl behind the counter who was preparing our food went back and forth from dining room to kitchen several times, was preparing food without any gloves, and to top it off she had a light blue band-aid on one finger of each hand. Having worked in food service in the past I know that anytime you change tasks in the kitchen it is best practice to wash your hands and put on new gloves. I didn't see her do any of the sort. I didn't see a sanitation rating posted but I'm assuming since they've only been open for about a week they haven't had a aviation from the health department yet. Needless to say I was highly disgusted and don't think I will be visiting this b.good location anytime soon.",

The customer service that I received (especially from Sean and Karen F.) was stellar, the presentation of the food was beautiful, and the quality and taste was absolutely excellent. From meticulously caring for specific allergy restrictions to bringing along attractive food labels to describe each dish to guests, they did a great job. Coming from someone who has worked in the food industry and now frequently coordinates the catering for company meals, B.Good is definitely on a higher level of quality than most. I also love that they make good quality, healthy food look and taste so delicious.  We ordered the burger and chicken sliders, which were accompanied with smashed avocado, BBQ sauce, sauteed mushrooms and other typical condiments. The whole wheat buns were fresh, the meat cooked very nicely, and the size quite large for sliders. The kale power salad was also totally delicious. Great job all around! I look forward to dropping by the store for lunch some time soon.",

I ordered the Kale smoothie and specified I can not have pineapple juice what I should have requested was a substitute for the pineapple juice. I also asked for a side of veggies only if the veggies were fresh NOT frozen and I needed to stress I WANTED them RAW! The person behind the registered gave me a side eye yet still politely put in my request. I turned to my son to ask if I had made myself clear as to how I wanted my food cause another side eye was given yet still the young lady maintained herself and kindly asked if I would like anything else. Long story short, my smoothie was about to be made with pineapple juice BUT the manager did NOT hesitate to intercept the order and immediately came to my rescue by offering/suggesting almond milk as a substitute for the pineapple juice. Not only did the manager complete my order but took time to engage in a brief conversation assuring my smoothie was made to my satisfaction. I wish I could recall their names because they went above and beyond not only to show their quality in service but also to help satisfy my hangry. Oh and yes my side of veggies were tasty.",

    "text": "The reason why I gave it 2 stars was due to their customer service and length of time it took to get my food. I ordered a spicy avocado and kale bowl. I sat down and seen multiple people come in after me and get their food which is always frustrating but it happens. At 25 minutes, I approached the counter to ask about my order and this woman told me that it would be out in a minute or two. Fifteen minutes later I approached again and was ready to give it to someone. As I approached they had what ended up being my food sitting at the counter for me to pickup. The woman behind the counter didn't know who's item it was and couldn't call out a number. Mind you, they have a little device that they give you when you order that is supposed to go off/buzz when your order is ready. Well either they didn't press the button to activate mine or it's faulty. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it might be faulty. But after waiting 40 minutes to get my food, which contained no meat(a reason why it shouldn't take as long), I received no apology but what I received was \"you waited 40min for a bowl?!\". This was the same woman that I approached 15 minutes before, she clearly did not remember. I took my bowl and went back to my table with no apology at all. The food was actually good too which is why I gave them the 2 stars. But it just didn't taste as good as it probably was after being so infuriated after that experience.",

My friends are vegan so always looking for places we can eat together. The food was great i loved my salad I wouldn't have  just ordered that normally but ill order it again.

I brought it back to the store and they did not seem to care or even apologize. I felt like I was being a bother to them. This isn't the first time they have messed up. We often order for our group and they constantly mess up our orders.For it being 3pm, they were not busy and had enough employees to clean. Floor was dirty and drink area was even worse. There were no straws, or ketchup or napkins.The employees were too busy joking around and flirting with each other. Oh, and the language they use is not professional at all. Won't be going back and we will not be ordering for our office from there anymore either. This is sad because when they first opened the service was alot better. Plus, we work in the same office building so it was nice to be able to get food quick. Guess we will be ordering more from Moes, Rush and Panera where they have much better service and food!",

Ordered the spicy avocado & lime super grain mix bowl and my fiance ordered the veggie burger \"west style side\" with regular fries and we both got a mix of of the delicious lemonades that they had prepared. The food was absolutely delicious !!!! The cashier was very helpful in describing all of the differences between items on the menu. The restaurant was clean and the same server was cleaning tables so it was maintained. They also sell beer and wine which was a plus. Overall a really great place to have lunch or dinner. ***Update*** The manager Coral and the cashier Maria helped us out  the second time we visited( the next day). We will definitely be visiting again",

The staff was extremely disorganized and were losing orders. I was grossed out to see them just slopping orders together, work area was disgusting as well. I heard several people come up and ask how much longer and had their order made on the spot, I'm assuming it just never got made. I asked about a couple of food ingredients and when the staff asked the manager she simply said, \"I don't know\". The cashier came back and told me they don't know what's in their food because their food doesn't have labels on it. For a place that's all about healthy, farm fresh etc. your staff better be informed on what's in your food. I finally requested a refund and left. Won't be back.",

    "text": "B.Good should be renamed to B.Great or B.Absolutely Fantastic! I stumbled upon this place today by accident and was thrilled to encounter a burger and fries that was made with such high quality ingredients and in such a clean way it literally tasted different. I know that all burgers and fries taste different but B.Good's food tastes unusual and in a fantastic way. The burger and fries did not taste like most restaurant's burgers and fries...you can taste the freshness in B.Good's ingredients. The bread tastes freshly baked, the meat is flavorful and juicy, the vegetables are farm fresh and the fries are flash fried in new oil so the potatoes absorb less grease and have this perfect micro thin fried exterior + soft goodness on the inside. They're dusted with sea salt and honestly this description does not do them justice. They've got unique sources for their ingredients so be sure to try everything. Keep an eye on the details like the taste of their ketchup and the selections at their soda fountain - it's all special, unique, and delicious. And on top of the great taste and high quality ingredients, B.Good is well priced, clean and comfortable inside, and has friendly staff members. The only feedback for improvement that I can offer is that they might look into eco-friendly utensils and cups. They're doing well w/ their to-go trays (recycled heavy duty paper material) but there's still room for improvement (i.e. biodegradable utensils, cups/lids, etc.). Also, set up recycle/compost bins next to the trash (like in Whole Foods)...that would take B.Good's eco-consciousness vibe to the next level and set a good example for the rest of Charlotte.",

    "text": "My boyfriend got the bacon and apple kale salad but it came without the bacon. When we asked the waitress she told us they had run out of bacon but they could grill up some different bacon on the grill. We waited for over 30 min and finished our food but the bacon still hadn't come out, which means they probably forgot about us. We were going to give them another chance and ask the cashier who said she would handle this but there was a line by then and we decided to just count it as a wash and leave.   I'm pretty disappointed it was such a bad experience because I wanted to find a good salad bar and my boyfriend was already skeptical. I don't think I will ever be able to convince him to go to a similar place again.   The salads taste wise were fine, I got their seasonal summer berry salad and was reasonably full even though it was a pretty small serving. I added chicken to mine for an extra few dollars so it came out to be $12. I also got their banana peanut smoothie which was $6! My boyfriend's salad was another $10 so the bill was $30 which is pretty high for two salads and a smoothie, all of which I could make at home for under $15. I get they want fresh, locally sourced ingredients but really?   Parking is free and easy, there is a deck that services the entire shopping plaza.",

I like to call ahead and grab and go. On multiple occasions I have called and no one would answer. Recently I called, a woman took my order, but when I arrived there was no record of it until they played detective and found the worker did not \"send the order back\" to the kitchen.  Then the woman came up to me and said yes she took my order but since she did not see my phone number on her caller ID she didn't bother to send it back to the kitchen staff. She did not apologize.  Her attitude was as if it was my fault. I asked her if she asked me for my phone number and she acknowledged that she had not. I don't think she got my point.   On this same visit while I was waiting in line to \"pick up my food\" (ha ha) saw the shift manager wrestle huge bags of garbage out through the side door. I then watched him go back directly to the kitchen and then ask if he could help me figure out where my food was.  He wanted to make my food while I waited. He was very nice but seemed surprised or a little put off when I suggested he wash his hands first (after handling the garbage). He gave me a look like how dare I be such a pain in his a66.  He then left and quickly came back putting on latex gloves. I decided to just leave. I called back to speak to the owner and 'resentful glove man' decided to lecture me on the difference between owners and managers in a franchise situation. After much convincing he finally agreed to pass my phone number on to a manager. WHEW!!!   I'm SO GLAD I didn't let this guy fix my food and just left.  I have a rule: I never eat food prepared by someone with any amount of resentment for me. Even if it is undeserved. I have seen the You Tube videos of what kitchen staff do to your food when they play God with your health.   What's frustrating is i was going to use the coupons on this visit that one of the MANAGERS had given me as a refund of my money from my purchases during a previous bad experience.   Like I said, I REALLY wanted to like this place. But they are not ready for prime time yet.",

The Mediterranean chicken salad isn't advertised as spicy and it was very spicy. Also the corn was no good and covered in sauce too. However, the service was exceptional! Would try again but ask that they put the sauce on the side so I can add it as I please-I'm personally not a fan of a drowning salad.",

    "text": "I grew up a vegetarian. But not just a vegetarian, almost a raw vegan. My family has always cooked veggies and proteins in such flavorful ways. Because of this, I have acquired a special sense to good healthy food. B.good does NOT have that sense. First of all, when you walk in you are greeted by an excessively large lobby where you have to go pretty close up to see the menu options. It is cold and kind of lonely, but I chalked that up to the fact that it was brand new and hadn't been worn in yet.   Then, once I got to front with my two friends (one of which ordered a turkey burger ahead of me), picked my burger out from the options (mind you, I am starving), I paid $16 dollars for my burger and a small side of fries. Again, I give them the benefit of the doubt because it is a healthy, all natural restaurant and these places tend to be a bit pricey. So finally, we sit down to wait for our food, the restaurant is COMPLETELY EMPTY except for us, and my friend has his turkey burger within minutes. But, my bean burger took a whopping 20 minutes while I watched them laugh it up and talk in the kitchen, NOT MAKING MY FOOD. I finally was so irritated that I went up there and asked about my food. They said \"Oh, we have to make everything fresh so that's why it's taking so long, we'll bring it to you.\"   That was fine, but when I got my food I was so unbelievably UPSET. I paid all of that money for a simple burger and it was soggy, tasteless and the burger didn't even stick together. It fell apart more and more with every bite! And the fries were tasteless too!   Anyone who recommends this place, seriously must not have any taste buds. I will not be going back nor will I be recommending it to anyone in my family most of which are vegetarians. I wouldn't want them to waste their money.",

    "text": "b.good is a refreshing new concept among a continually evolving south Charlotte restaurant scene. It is, in fact, the only farm-to-table offering in the franchise-heavy area in which it resides. I do like this location a bit better than it's sister restaurant in Stonecrest one exit down off 485. The dining area is much brighter and roomier.  I have  gone with the Kale and Grain Bowls on two of my three trips. The power bowl, laden with brussels sprouts and crunchy chickpeas, was tasty and filling. The veggie burger is beautfully presented and  flavorful. Still, though nothing has really blown me away.   Service and was okay and sanitation was barely acceptable at a grade of 93. Unfortunately for them, there are just too many excellent restaurants in the area for just barely acceptable sanitation grades. Hopefully both locations will improve upon that going forward. Otherwise, a GoPlaySave Buy1 Get1 Free coupon will guarantee that I'll at least return for one more visit.",

It's been on my radar for some time now when I noticed how much they push using fresh ingredients and supporting local communities. I am always down for food with a good cause! Some coworkers and i almost landed at rush but i could not pass this place one more time without trying it. I ordered the zucchini spaghetti and falafel meatballs, which was highlyyyy recommended, with the kale crush smoothie. I was not disappointed at all. My first sip of the smoothie I could taste the fresh kale, it was very thick but manageable. The spaghetti was everything I had been craving that day. They are a little up there in price as well but I believe the dollar was worth every bite I took. I finished my food and was ready to go back for seconds as soon as I was finished. I am so happy this place is so close to work and will probably be there everyday moving forward. My goal is to explore this menu to the fullest.",

However, after giving them \"the benefit of doubt\", eating and spending my money in multiple occasions by the 5th time I am giving up. So get ready to read my review:  1. Horrible customer service. 2. Constantly understaffed (no reason their service sucks). 3. Super expensive for the quality and portions. 4. Who serves SOGGIE fries more than 3x in a row? 5. Please do not call an \"eggplant ball salad\" a bowl full of kale, 2cherry tomatoes and 4 mini eggplant balls.I do have to say these eggplant balls are delicious. 6. Please have your personnel know and learn of your products, dishes and menus.  7. Extra toasted buns is very different than burnt buns.  8. Stick to your personnel even if you hire teens and temps, please let customers relate to at least one familiar face.   Have to give credit on the fountain natural drinks that's super!  I still have hopes on management taking some of these constructive feedback for the best turnaround, as the potential for this brand and overall restaurant is over the charts!!!

Veggie burger had bacon on it,bun was rock hard and crumbled to pieces. Veggie burger was inedible. It wasn't even the correct toppings. Sweet potato fries were cold, limp, yet blackened ends. Beef burger was served el gaupo style instead of it being on the veggie burger. The veggie burger came with cabbage and bacon? No cheese. Even if the cashier put in the order wrong, it still didn't even resemble what was on the ticket.   Few people inside and two other people had to have their orders fixed as well.  My friend decided to try the veggie burger as is minus the bacon and they did not finish it.   They refired my beef burger and sweet potatoes fries. His time order was correct, however the burger tasted like lighter fluid and was extremely charred and smothered in almost a half a cup of bbq sauce. For $30 I would have expected more at least in terms of quality. We threw the food out and left.   The other patrons looked just as disappointed as us. The shining light was the ice tea was okay and they had a tasty beet juice lemonade.   Will not return. It should have been a warning this place was completely empty on a Saturday evening when all the surrounding establishments had lines out the door almost.",

The salad selections are terrific and better than at some of the fine dining restaurants.  I had the southwest salad and it was delicious.  The dressing was like a chipotle flavor. It had something crunchy and yummy in the salad.  I have no idea what it was, but it added a lot of fun to my palette!   I only wish the portion size had been a bit more generous.  The salad was served in a big round open bowl and the bowl was not very full.  My mother was with me today and she had a turkey burger and sweet potato fries.  The fries seemed to be finished off in the oven.  They were not greasy.  The place reeks of ORGANIC everything.  Even the beverages are unique and seem on the organic side.  Try the beet ginger drink; it has an amazing flavor.  I love the concept and love the food.  Sometimes It's good to have servers waiting on you and sometimes a pop in place like this, where you order at the counter, is just fine.  Personally, I would rank this food right up there with fancy places that charge twice as much.   I am surprised that I liked it this much.  Two thumbs up and I will return.",

I like a fat-greasy burger with non-organic fries - but - perhaps I should reconsider. This place was great. I was impressed with the sizes of the entrees (you won't leave hungry). It's always scary (for me) to go full on vegetarian when I'm starving, but I took the risk this week when I visited B.Good and whoa nelly, color me impressed. I ordered the zucchini spaghetti with eggplant meatballs and oh-my-yum. I'd definitely order it again. The flavored waters available up front are also pretty tasty. It was ~400 calories for lunch out, I was satisfied and it was quite good. I just wish I could convince my family to join me one day, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. (they prefer grease laden burgers)! Looks like I'll have to settle for work lunches with colleagues and the fact that this place isn't busting at the seams at the lunch hour is actually an added bonus. Better get in there before people catch on... healthy can be cool.",

I had the Spicy Kale Superfood bowl with a green smoothie. It was so Fresh and full of flavor each veggie was crisp. Visit #2 Semi Welcomed, order taken semi prompt, food presented good. I got the same items from visit #1 with some additions for our son and my husband who came for their first visit. The order came out incorrect twice, however they were prompt in correcting the mistakes.  Visit #3 Not welcomed, food took EXTREMELY LONG & when I went to inquire they lost my ticket and had to start my order at that time (20mins after I re approached) Visits 4-6 Ordered to go and got items from visit #1 which was made correct however two of those visits it took extremely long and the place wasn't busy. I really enjoy the two items o frequently order but think I'll give them some time to work out the kinks in their process before frequenting.   Let's not forget that kitchen is open so you can watch your food being prepared and the fresh veggies are displayed in a glass wall on one side of the seating area where you can see all the yummy fresh veggies. They also have ROOTS brand soda on tap which is cool. And a number of fresh lemonades to choose from.",

However, the last few times I've ordered ahead and gotten  the to-go order back to my office, I was given a raw burger, then no chicken on my chicken salad a second time. The service isn't friendly and it takes a long time to get your food if you wait to order once you are there. If you actually look at the calorie counts of the food, it's not that healthy. You are better off at Panera next door. Too bad because the Be Good app is great and the company has always responded to my concerns by offering me free food.",

They get their food from local sources and have options for different diets (vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free). I got the kale, Brussel sprouts, and butternut squash salad with a side of sweet potato fries. The salad itself was a little salty for me. I think it was the sunflower seeds in it, but it was very healthy. The sweet potato fries were a generous serving and I could tell they were made from scratch.  I liked that they had low carb options. I noticed they had eggplant meatballs with zucchini fries. If I had another opportunity, I would try that dish. Another interesting menu item I noticed, were the different burgers they had. If I lived here, I know that I would be a regular at this restaurant! So many options to choose from.",

I'm not a mind reader ...I stated that I need the order 'to go' both individuals acted that they did not want to be there.. when ringing up my order he said to me is this to go, I had just stayed at that before I didn't stutter I'm the only one in the place. I asked him what size was the smoothie available he said we'll make it one size, OK what is it LOL. And when preparing my burger there was nothing that stated that would you like this cooked medium well or well done. The individual making my burger just handed me the burger and fries and I stated to him I need my kale crush oh he said. After taking his time and making it he hands it to me and says bye I just gave him a grin and shook my head that is not customer service I will not be going back to this location for this chain again unacceptable I dropped over $20 just on a very simple meal and his two individuals did not act like they wanted to be there . My sweet potato fries were soggy and flavorless...A white guy in his late 40s and a black guy I'm assuming in his 20s . Not cool. With no customer service that's why you're working at a burger  joint. I hope the management that reads this really coach their people. My family and I will go somewhere else next time avoid please  'been good'",

We viewed the menu and decided with what we wanted. The gentleman came out and took our order. I got the grilled chicken sandwich on wheat and a order of fries. My husband got the Mediterranean bowl. We also got a side of jalapeno sauce to dip with the fries. The sauce was good and spicy. My sandwich was good. Not bland at all and juicy. My husband liked the bowl but wished he tried something else.   Overall, the experience was ok.",

Our smoothies tasted great and were made from real ingredients (not juice)which I appreciated. The fact that they were less than $3.50 a piece was even better.   We were there during a down time (Wednesday around 3pm) so the restaurant was Empty. I noticed it was extremely clean and the staff was friendly.

Good prides itself on serving locally grown and procured fresh, live foods to the delight of its customers.   I partook in their acai berries smoothie, compromised of acai berries, blueberries, pineapple, banana, almond milk, chia, and lemon, which was mouth-wateringly superb. Service was surprisingly quick, even though being in the midst of the busy lunch rush in the ballentine village retail area. The staff was very attentive and provided a free smoothie card for feedback on my visit. A charming, well maintained spot worthy of repeat visits for those seeking the healthy alternatives.",

The food was healthy, delicious and the staff was wonderful -- they seemed really proud to be working there and proud of the food they were serving. And they had a right to be, it was wholesome & delicious, a welcome addition to Ballantyne Village! Sadly, things went downhill fairly quickly. Have to agree with other reviewers -- consistently SOGGY FRIES?? Eggplant meatballs that were delicious at first suddenly tasteless and in our opinions inedible? We'd never \"dine in\" there, it's depressing. Haven't been back for a while and from what I've been hearing and reading I'm surprised they are still in business.",

We had to park in front of mellow mushroom and walk over to b.good (which was fine) but when we got there, the full bag of food didn't have any handles on it and my two drinks didn't come with any sort of drink carrier. I was holding my 1 year old in my arms and my 3 year old was walking beside me, I had limited ability to get these items so after I paid I asked if I could pull up in front of the store (there were no parking spots) and have them run the items out to me. Their response was \"um you can leave your car there and come inside\" so I said \"my kids will be in the car I can't leave them in there\" and the girl shrugged her shoulders. I went and got the car, pulled up, jumped out, ran in, got honked at, jumped back in my car and drove off.   At that point my kids are screaming for food and we have no straws, no napkins, and no cutlery. Ballantyne is full of families and mommies with young kids, and this place is not kid friendly. Let's hope the food works out (when we get home and find silverware, straws, and napkins).",

I had all intentions of ordering the all natural hamburger & fresh cut fries however, one of the employees recommended the eggplant meatballs and I reluctantly ordered them.  They were amazing and now my new favorite.   I also ventured out to try the zucchini spaghetti - I will have to admit that it wasn't bad.  I definitely think the sauce made it taste good - still zucchini.. but very tasty. I particularly like how they get their food from local farms and vendors.  Another pleasant surprise were the drinks offered there such as minty lemonade and another one was made with beet juice (which I loved).   Awesome, friendly service.  They won me over and I am a tough one to eat healthy.",

    "text": "I've now been three times since they opened and I've been sadly disappointment all three times....mostly in the service. I really want to like b.good and I want to be a frequent customer on nights when I'm too tired to cook, but they've got some serious customer service issues that need to be worked out or they'll never survive in this area. My first visit was the best of the three except that they served my sister the worst grilled cheese sandwich, fries and broccoli I've ever seen. I'm actually shocked that they weren't embarrassed to hand her that meal. My Southwestern Chicken Salad was absolutely delicious! When we returned the second time, we were both charged extra for the chicken on the Southwestern CHICKEN Salad despite my long conversation with the cashier when they asked me if I wanted \"chicken\" on my salad??? The staff seems clueless and whoever is responsible for training them is doing a terrible job! I also asked them not to put the fresh tomatoes on my salad but they did anyway. Tonight, I called my order in because I had previously had to wait SO long for my order.  I again asked for no tomatoes. I actually had a pretty lengthy conversation with the gentleman who answered the phone about my order, stressing to please leave of the fresh tomatoes. When I arrived, there was one customer placing an order and no other customer in the restaurant.  I went to the pickup counter and noticed that I had tomatoes on my salad.  I didn't say anything, because I could just pick them off. The salad was also half the size of the one I got the first time. The thing that has pushed me into writing this review is that I stood there for 8-10 minutes waiting to pay for my order and the other 3 employees who were working never even acknowledged that I'd been standing behind this woman forever. I wouldn't have expected that pleasantly CLUELESS young man to stop helping the woman ahead of me, but the fact that they weren't busy, they knew I had a to-go order because they gave it to me, and yet they still let the young man stands there searching for buttons on the screen without offering to help me, or at least acknowledging that I'd been waiting an unreasonably long time.  I'd hoped that they'd have a chance to work out the kinks,  but they seem to be headed in the wrong direction. It will be very hard for me to return, which makes me sad.  I really like the Southwestern Chicken salad....even if they ask me if I want chicken on it!",

I got the spicy avocado and lime bowl my first visit and loved it...I will say, it can get expensive if you add meat/ eggs. The smoothies have unique flavors that I have loved every time! I will definitely be coming back!",
