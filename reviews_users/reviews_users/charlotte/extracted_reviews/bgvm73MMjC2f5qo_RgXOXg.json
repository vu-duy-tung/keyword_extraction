We got the quail, burger, and kimchee fried rice with pig ears.  everything tasted very good, and our server was excellent.  Very knowledgeable and very well spoken.",

The coffee was delicious- any place that offers stevia and natural sugar instead of carcinogenic products is the bomb.   I ordered the Falafel Wrap ($13) without the tzatiki sauce- it was delicious. Not too dry like some other falafel I've had. The pickled peppers tho   Nothing to complain about at all. Definitely check out this place if you're in Charlotte",

    "text": "- Fantastic food! - Horrible service (worst I have ever had) - Ambivalent management and staff  SUMMARY: Lovely restaurant and great food. The service and management show no concern for their customers or their reputation. Ambivalence doesn't begin to describe the lack of customer focus at this very expensive restaurant. This is a warning. Find another nice restaurant choice.  The Setting: 8 adults, 40th birthday celebration, 7:45 PM, Saturday night, reservation. Restaurant was about half full (odd on a Saturday night - may be a sign of decline)  The Food: The plates, from start to finish, were full of flavor, perfectly prepared, and well presented. Not really worth the price as nearby competing restaurants offer better value but definitely a treat. Everyone liked their entrees, especially the one remaining plate of venison (apparently what was available was not worth serving they said. Odd!). Drinks were good and imaginative.  The Service: Colossally incompetent would not sum it up sufficiently. From the start, at the small bar, of which it was just our party, we had to hail the bartender to get service even as we were the only ones standing there. At the table we were greeted relatively promptly and the menu explained. The \"snacks\" would come more or less immediately and would hold us over until appetizers came out. So we ordered two \"snacks\" and one appetizer.  - - - - Twenty-two minutes later, after we had finished a bottle of wine and several water glasses were empty for some time, we got up and found the waiter to ask where they were. He said \"two minutes more\". Eight minutes later (now a full 30 minutes) our immediate \"snacks\" arrived. The appetizer came 5 minutes later (now 35 minutes! - that was the only plate taken from the bill). They were good. Water glasses filled again. NOT A WORD was said in apology or acknowledgement. Now, after nearly 40 minutes, we actually ordered our entrees. WTF!?   We have seen the waiter maybe twice and the manager once as he told us (15 minutes after we ordered) that only one venison plate was worthy of serving. Order something else.  Here we are, seated about about 8pm. At 9:25 the entrees arrived. They were fabulous. One of our party had to get his in a \"to go bag\" as he had not planned on a two hour dinner. None of us had.  End Result: While the manager did bring a plate of lovely truffles for the birthday girl (thank you) not a word, no apology, no mention whatsoever of the tremendously poor service and ridiculously long wait times (and again, the restaurant was full of empty tables). Nothing but the one appetizer was provided in compensation. The manager never even came to apologize and address the concerns that we voiced, relatively politely at first, throughout the \"ordeal\".",

    "text": "Halycyon, Flavors from the Earth! Great Name for a Restaurant that serves incredible small plates. Went to dinner on a Sat before a concert, we had quite a bit of time but did mention to our server that we had to be out by at least 7:30 to make the concert, she was very prompt with all we ordered. We started out with \"SOME PIG\" which is a variation on a Old Fashion with Benton Bacon infused Makers Mark 46. With BACON stir sticks..which made the drink!! We then went on to the Scallops and Pork Belly, which was probably some of the absolute best Pork Belly I have ever had!  A Blue Cheese souffle - melted in your mouth with a veloute sauce and  beech mushrooms ! I could have done shots of the sauce! The Foie Gras was delicous, a very nice portion and cooked perfectly. We then got the Kobe Beef Tartar with Harissa. Now I love Steak Tartar any way but I do think the flavor of the Harissa ( which I also adore) was a tiny bit overwhelming on the beautiful beef. For dessert we ended with a Cheese tray which was outstanding..all the little chutneys and purees were perfect with each different cheese. I will be coming back to this beauty again. Kudos to the Chef for his creative thinking on the small plates. Loved it!!",

It makes sense that you should enjoy graceful New American food after enjoying some modern art, but the place stays open into the night after the museum has closed. This makes for a somewhat odd and isolated atmosphere when you're first entering and leaving the place (there's not much going on on that block besides the museum itself!) but if you're looking for some food and ambience to linger over, its relative isolation is worth overlooking.",

    "text": "Aside from the full name (Halcyon Flavors from the Earth? It sounds like a chapter in \"Lord of the Rings\") this place is a sophisticated and delightful addition to the Charlotte dining scene.  My go-to place in town is Soul Gastrolounge... Halcyon is a step up, in both quality and price point, and a gorgeous space for a date night.   It's in the new Mint Museum (there's parking underground); and it's smaller than you'd expect. A smattering of tables around the room and several bars that overlook the kitchen. Several of the tables are made of big slabs of varnished tree wood... just beautiful.   At dinner we started with 2 cocktails: bourbon with maple syrup and bacon (awesome, though don't forget to stir before you sip); and gin with arugula and black pepper. I'm an arugula freak so this should have been right up my alley - but it needed something sweet or citrusy to balance all that bite. Don't get me wrong, I finished it, but it was what I'd call a \"sipper.\"   Among the appetizers you MUST get the country ham skillet cornbread with blackberry butter. I want this for breakfast every day.   I love to share plates so we started with the cornbread, then shared the \"Snack board\" - boiled peanut hummus, deviled eggs, homemade pickles, pimento cheese with bacon marmalade, and some kind of blackbean spread.  At $17 it's a pricey appetizer but frankly you could JUST have this followed by one entree and leave perfectly sated. All the options were winners except the black beans, which tasted vaguely like Mexican refried beans.  I've had something similar (eerily similar in fact, at Empire State South in Atlanta: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eattalk.net%2F2012%2F08%2Fpostcard-from-atlanta.html%23.UE5TxlSJ9Mo&s=57fe0d80a80af33b70cd419417585a8978064819dbeb9751dd8dfdfdf3e2a557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eattalk.net/2012/08/post...</a>) only Halycon was much more even-handed with the salt, and I appreciated the thin flatbread that came with the dips.  After the snacks, the salad. Given the season I opted for the tomato salad, simply dressed and tossed with herbs and fried bread. Delicious.  They have several interesting entree options but we split the Market hog - whatever cut of pork the chef is in the mood for that night. Ours was a pork chop grilled medium, served with french toast stuffed with peach compote and some kind of cheese (marscapone? ricotta?). I expected something a little more refined... it was literally a serving of stuffed french toast. Huge. Tasty, to be sure, but a ton of food... and the pork chop was the size of my face.   Didn't stop us from ordering dessert, though! a peach-blueberry cobbler that they wanted to serve a la mode with spiced orange ice cream but spiced orange ice cream just seemed WRONG with that kind of cobbler. I opted for whipped cream and a frankly STUNNING cup of coffee.   This place is great. A Must-Do in Charlotte. -erin <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eatTALK.net&s=bd031a9efc4f60424baee2302baf37a0d496900bc6fd1aba8627d4698bde0b50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatTALK.net</a>",

They got the ceviche just right and was a delightful burst of citrus. The blue cheese souffle is a MUST try. Light n subtle. Just melt in your mouth goodness. The bulgur salad was okay but the clams that a colleague ordered looked great. The dark chocolate dessert was the star of the show. I intended a bit but set the whole thing. Oh yea. THAT good.

We ordered takeout, and were quoted 25 minutes. We showed up and ended up waiting another thirty minutes past that point. We requested additional vegetables instead of the desert included in our special, and once we got back realized that not only were there no additional vegetables, but they didn't even give us the rice that comes with it. With the chicken was what we initially thought was honey mustard (?) but turns out it was just gelatinous butter, which in no way went with the dish. Lastly, and most importantly, the chicken was undercooked to the point of making one of us sick later that night, even though we both threw ours out once we noticed how undercooked it was. We reached out to the manager listed on their website with our concerns, and have been ignored. Long story short, poor food, poor preparation, and non-existent customer service at a restaurant that should rank highly in each of those categories.",

    "text": "I came here while on a business trip a few weeks ago. Having never been to Charlotte, one of my coworkers picked it out. I wasn't sure what to think at first because it was located in part of a larger building (I think it was a museum?) That's probably the only gripe I had about this place.   As for the decor, it was somewhat dark, but not dark enough that I couldn't read the menu or see my companions. The furniture was fitting with the rest of the restaurant and included this really cool looking wooden table in the middle that looked like a split log. The music in the background set the mood and wasn't intrusive.  Now for the food. We asked the waiter for suggestions, and ordered all the small plates he suggested. I think he also recommended the stuffed rabbit but all of us didn't feel comfortable eating that, being from the northeast. I don't remember all of them, but there was a delicious sausage plate, seafood/mushroom plate, blue cheese plate, and a great flatbread. Everything looked small at first, but was actually quite filling by the end of the dinner. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and were cooked perfectly.   The service was excellent, with the food coming on a timely manner and the waiters treating us with courtesy.   We each got the \"Some Pig\" cocktail, which was Maker's Mark with a strip of bacon. The bacon didn't really make it taste all that different, but hey, who doesn't like bacon? I would definitely come here again!",

We're organic gardeners and big supporters of our local markets (go Atherton!), so it felt great to think about spending our hard-earned cash on a place that passes it on to our hard-working local farmers. We were *not* disappointed!   Upon making our reservation, I indicated I would appreciate a vegan, gluten-free meal. (This was off-menu, as you might imagine.) I called to make sure the message had gotten to the chef, and when we arrived, our waiter (who was attentive but not overly so) let me know the chef was preparing a celery-root mash base with a kale and overnight-roasted tomato topping, a lovely, light sauce, and day lily tubers (?!). I then requested some additional rice for \"heft,\" which they happily accommodated. I felt very well taken care of! (And, even better, we found out later that one of the line cooks prepared my entree AND is the farmer who grew most of the produce in it!)  We started with wine (for me) and beer (for him), both fabulous, an appetizer of hummus and pickled veggies (for me) and pimento cheese and flatbread (for him), all amazing, and I had a local-greens salad with peanut vinaigrette and caramel popcorn \"croutons.\" The greens turned out to be local kale and baby collards--totally raw--and were totally delicious.  Our entrees were absolutely mouthwatering. Mine was perfect, and my husband took advantage of the evening's Shrimp & Grits special, which was perfect.   Given the high-but-mixed reviews here, we were 100% pleased and will go back again in the hopes that round #2 is as good as round #1!",

Ambiance and presentation are top notch. Decor is very modern and artistic. Service is excellent. The food and wine are great. It is pricey, but I always leave relaxed, extremely satisfied and feel like I have tried something new and delicious. That makes it worth the money.  They have a good wine selection. Entrees - I have had rabbit, venison, and duck. All are uncommon in the Charlotte restaurant scene. All have been prepared extremely well. Vegetables and garnishes are very fresh and presented well. They even make brussel sprouts taste great (which deserves a couple stars just for that - LOL). This is a must try in Chrlotte.",

I really wanted to sit outside on this beautiful evening, but who knew it was going to be a challenge to find such a place. (I guess I had NY/Charleston/Baltimore on my mind). Luckily this place was recommended by a gentleman we met earlier at Bernardin's, and there were plenty of open tables outside on the patio. Lovely place and service, but the food was a bit too \"experimental\" for my taste. I chose a scallop dish, but wow, it was so salty I couldn't eat it. Our waitress was very kind in trying to help, and the manager also came out to talk to us. They offered to make a simple scallop dish, and also recommended a couple of very tasty concoctions. It was good, but I don't think I'll try it again.",

The decor is just beautiful, tables made out of cross-sectioned tree trunks, lights flooding the room from the huge windows. It made a beautiful day even better.   I ordered the kale salad with salmon, it was delicious.  My husband had the shrimp and chickpea salad and he loved it. And our out-of-town friends got the house roasted turkey sandwich which they loved and told the server that they need to call it something else because the menu description doesn't do it justice.  The service was attentive and everyone was friendly.  I don't know if it was an off day but it was a light crowd for the Charlotte brunch set.  All in all, it was great and we will return!",

Service was very nice, no rushing or acting weird because I was taking up a table, he served me a beautiful cup of coffee.  Freshly made, strong, served in a large, simple, ceramic cup.  It was the best cup of coffee I've had in Charlotte in a restaurant setting that didn't specialize in coffee. Shockingly delicious.  Then I wondered how much it was going to be...  two bucks. I can afford that!    My friend arrived we ordered a few items to nosh on, French onion soup and a grilled scallop and brussel sprout dish.  They brought me the wrong item, the server was really nice about, the food runner was prompt in taking care of it and my scallop dish came out really fast.  Handled very professionally.  I cannot wait to go back, the first sign of warmer weather, you can meet me at the Mint!",

    "text": "With a name like Halcyon Flavors from the Earth, I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but color me impressed!  After a tour of the Mint Museum next door, I had worked up an appetite and the desire to sit down and reflect quietly for a bit.  What a beautiful space!  With a large wall painted a Carolina blue with white birds silhouetted, neutral-nature upholstered comfy chairs paired with wooden tables, some of which looked like they were cross-sections of large trees, along with the chandeliers made of soft lighting and branches... wow.  They also had exterior patio seating with beautiful views of uptown Charlotte.  I really was wowed by the space itself and was looking forward to my lunch.   My waiter, I believe he said his name was Noah, was polite and helpful.  I asked him for his suggestions and went with his first suggestion of a Monte Carlo, which was an open-faced sandwich of custard soaked brioche, topped with cheddar cheese, BBQ and cole slaw, and served with house-made fries.  Noah was quickly over-sat with the uptown lunch time crowd and did his best to keep up but I rarely saw him once my order was placed - he seemed to be working twice as many tables (indoor and outdoor) as the other 2 waiters that I saw.  The sandwich was quite good (I have added photos of the sandwich and the fries).  The cole slaw was creamy without being drenched and the BBQ was well flavored.  It was a bit of a mess to eat, so if you are on a date or with your boss, I would pick something a little neater.  The fries were delicious and the house-made ketchup was sweet and subtle, letting the taste of the fries come through.    My total for water and sandwich/fries was just over $14, so by no means a crazy-expensive lunch, and well worth it to enjoy the restaurant itself.  Had it been a slightly cooler day out instead of a late-June mid-80's, the patio seating would be wonderful, though this time of year, the seating along the railing was full sun and I imagine a little warm.  Should I find myself at this end of Charlotte again, I would not hesitate to stop at Halcyon for a meal.",

    "text": "We came here for Sunday brunch at around 2pm. I've been in Charlotte for almost two months now and I've finally come to realize just how quiet the city is on Sundays. There were only five other tables that were occupied, four outside on the patio and one inside. It was warm enough outside to sit on the patio but I had fallen in love with the photos of the indoor decor on Yelp so we chose to eat inside.  We ordered the cheese plate (trio for $16) to share. I ordered the Daily Grind burger ($12) and he ordered the Monte Cristo ($13).   I really liked my burger. The meat was tasty and juicy! I loved the green tomato chow chow and black pepper aioli. It was so good that I didn't care to drown it in ketchup like I normally do with burgers. AND I didn't even need a pickle which is usually a must! I usually take the top bun off as well (to save on carbs lol) but the brioche bun was so buttery good that I had to keep the top on and eat it like a normal human being. lol. The burger came with a side of local greens in buttermilk dressing.  My bf's Monte Cristo was good but not anything spectacular. It just tasted like all the other pulled pork sandwiches that we've had at the BBQ spots in Uptown. The custard-dipped brioche bun was a nice contrast to the pork. It came with a side of house-cut fries. It turned out to be a very heavy meal with the hefty serving of pork and side of fries. He actually wished he had ordered a side salad instead of the fries since he liked the dressing on mine.  Good thing the cheese plate was excellent otherwise I would've felt guilty since his meal choice wasn't as good as mine. I was in love with my burger! He also liked his Tennessee Schmaltz ($13) so I think those two items made up for his entree.   We ended up having the cheese plate come out after our entree since our waiter forgot to put the order in. He apologized for the oversight and when the manager brought it out, she apologized, and told us that the cheese plate was complimentary. Nice save! :)  Too bad the acoustics aren't that great inside due to the high ceilings and all the bare, hard surfaces. I could see how noisy it could get if it was crowded. They were playing beautiful French music while we were there but it sounded like they were playing it at the highest volume on a not-so-great sound system (or maybe it was just the high ceilings) so it didn't sound the best. Good music selection though.   Overall, Halcyon lived up to my expectations. The decor was just as beautiful as in the photos, I loved the farm to table concept, and the food and service was great! I plan on steering the bf back here one last time before we leave ;)",

Whatever, I'm in a rush and it's the only option so I didn't say anything. What I do care about though is paying for ingredients and then not getting them. The website says:  Panko Fried Chicken Sandwich  Tomato. Avocado. Arugula. Chipotle Onions. White Cheddar. Brioche 13  However, the sandwich came with no chipotle onions and no avocado. Was expecting something somewhat spicy but it was super sweet. The brioche was overpowering and I just threw the chicken in the side salad. Really annoyed to pay $15 and not get what was promised.",

Spacious, woodsy seating space with ample room to settle in for a good catch-up with an old friend. The staff seemed new and somewhat overwhelmed with designer foodie terms. Wine list was reasonably priced and had a good representation of regions to accompany local farm to table fare.  We had a few questions as to the local cheeses which turned out to be from elsewhere but our server explained they used local merchants for products not available regionally or seasonally. Shared a trio of cheeses to start and split the short rib with slight side of creamy mashed potatoes and vegetable cubes of what looked like root veggies. The serving of meat was huge for one person so we left perfectly content. Recommended for large and small groups (the largest dining room table being a slice of an ancient tree - beautiful). It had a few kinks to work out in service, chipped plates and wobbly tables but once they get a little more time in food tasting/training and attention to detail, they'll likely be around for a good long while.",

I had the French Onion soup and the broth tasted like it was made from Beef Base paste from a plastic tub.  I had the \"Soup & Salad,\" an affectation of a \"table-side pressed romano tea\" served over a slice of bread, warmed romaine leaves, an unpleasant aioli sauce and a downright fishy tasting \"boquerone.\" I couldn't eat anything else after eating the anchovy--it tasted pretty long in the tooth. The \"tea\" was unremarkable, and again, the broth tasted like something out of a can.  One of my friends ordered the vegetarian plate: nothing brilliant there. Collards were the main feature. My other friend ordered the \"Winter Salad\" which featured \"bruleed beet carpaccio.\" Basically steamed beet slices with crunchy sugar on them. And not in a good way.  The waiter, although she was very helpful and pleasant, kept gushing about \"Chef tries this\" and \"Chef believes that\" and \"Chef always does this other thing.\" If the food had been excellent, all this Chef genuflection would have been deserved. However, I had the feeling of a completely commercialized effort to exploit the concept of farm-to-table philosophy without the cooking skills to support it. There was no finesse in the food preparation (except in the presentation--the food looked pretty on the plates), or integrity in the ingredients themselves, at least in terms of flavor.  The space is beautiful, a very chic, well-concieved \"forest\" theme with metal nest chandeliers, fiddlehead fern flatware, river-polished stones for salt-and-pepper shakes, and a gorgeous slab of tree for a table. The chairs were generously wide and comfortable.  IMVHO, this kind of restaurant gives the farm-to-table movement a bad name: all pretense and showmanship with no integrity of serious cooking to back up the concept.",

    "text": "Had lunch at Halycyon in December, 2010 and enjoyed the soup & salad appetizer, which should really be renamed shrimp salad -- it's a beautiful presentation with head-on shrimp over greens and dressed at the table. For my main, I had the scallops, which were perfectly prepared with a bacon sauce. The portions are not large here, so I had room for dessert. What the waiter described as beignets were really donut holes -- so at first I was a bit disappointed, but the raspberry spread and chocolate mocha mousse made perfect dipping sauces and overall this is a 5 star restaurant. Can't wait to go back and try some other menu items.",

The meal was amazing, from the mint infused unsweet iced tea, to the seared scallops with brussel sprout petals(yes i said petals) and the 3 little pigs entree, my bestie and i split the 2 entrees. I highly recommend this place.  Holla!",

Parking and getting to it is a breeze which is really nice considering its location could have proved to be tricky. The atmosphere is amazing! The decor is earthy yet minimal and modern letting the view take the lead.  There is a water feature in the middle of the restaurant and soft music playing to set the mood. Our server started off really strong but got overwhelmed as it got busier and he couldn't handle it.  He was knowledgable about the menu even going so far as to tell us the honey drizzle on the blue cheese was from the bees atop the Ritz Carlton! Nice touch! We started off with the trio of cheeses served with fresh fruit, different jams and the aforementioned honey, shared the Farmers salad ( strawberries and toasted biscuit with a white chocolate vinaigrette!) and then I ordered the banana pecan French toast and my partner ordered the Shepherds Benedict.  Portions are large and hearty, most people could probably share one entree but it was nice to have a fine dining experience with oversized portions.  We were starving! The flavors and execution are beyond reproach and this will be our nice brunch spot from here on out. Truly a lovely and relaxing way to start our day in the amazing Queen City and a fantastic start to my birthday!",

The presentation of the food is lovely; however, the flavors are too subtle.  You take a bite and wait for the burst, but alas, it stays tightly bundled up and never delivers.  I've found this to be the case with many dishes.  With that being said, it is obviously a very thoughtful menu.  Perhaps the food caters to a more delicate palette.  Unless I was going to the museum, and with the price point, I'd rather not be bothered with driving into town, paying to park and be set up for disappointment again.",

    "text": "Saturday night, we make an early res before a show, and we take our time at Halcyon. We order a few courses, some starter plates and a big entree, and we sip our drinks and enjoy the laid-back ambiance. And then I casually glance at my watch and almost have a stroke. Our entree is not even out of the kitchen and we realize we have drastically miss-planned, and our relaxed evening turns into a late-running nightmare; we don't have time for the entree! After a moment of real panic, we decide to ask our server if there's any possibility we can, um, not have the entree. Not his fault at all, service was excellent and attentive, we just ordered too many little courses and didn't realize we'd spent so much time jibber-jabbering and eating and enjoying ourselves and the food and now we don't have time for the entree! (We were mortified!) No problem, Chris thought fast and smartly rerouted our freshly cooked entree to a nearby table who had ordered the same thing, and we were out of there on time and made it to the show. Amazing service, on top of excellent food (fantastic cheese plate, superior scallops with pork belly, phenomenal spicy chocolate creme brule dessert), and no way we could tip Chris enough for the great move he made in response to our poor planning. Halcyon has been one of our favorite places in the city, and we plan to go much more often in the coming new year. Thanks, Chris!",

The food has been excellent most of the time and if it hasn't than its okay because the restaurant is seasonal and you always look forward to a new menu with new ideas when the weather changes. Maggie Rupert is always coming up with new fresh cocktail recipes that blow most, if not all, charlotte \"cocktail bars\" out of the water. And even though she is pretty much running the entire restaurant every time I visit, she still takes time to say hello and sometimes make me a new cocktail that she is working on. First and foremost your cocktails must be thoughtfully constructed and balanced but second, and sometimes more important, your interaction as a bartender with your customer must be sincere and polite. This place has it all! Oh yeah, its in the entrance of the Mint Museum and the decor is almost as good as the exhibits in the museum!",

When we arrived, we were asked to wait at the bar, even though half of the room had open tables. Thankfully, we didn't wait more than 10 minutes. The server was friendly and went over the specials immediately. We ordered appetizers - cheese plate, french onion soup and a quail appetizer - all were very good. Our main courses were equally delicious - had the lamb special and the chicken dish. No complaints at all. The desert menu is limited, in my opinion but we ended up going with the creme brulee and it was amazing. Towards the end of my meal, the waitress absentmindedly poured water in my wine glass. That surprised me as I felt she was on top of it all night. Other than that, the service was good. The atmosphere is very nice and romantic. Enjoyed it and would go back. There was outdoor seating which I think will be great once the weather allows.",

Everything I had was great. I started with a gin drink called the seer. Light refreshing and a good kick. Then I got the squash blossoms as an app. Light almost a tempura style batter stuffed with cheese and seved on a nice tomato chutney or salsa. The waiter asked to take my plate but I shut him down. I used the home made bread to sop up all the flavors from the bottom of the bowl. Next I ordered a nice clean but not too fruity hefeweisen from Vancouver bc. I love wheat beer and this is right up there with the best. For my first course I ordered the lyonnaise salad. This was a bit unsuspected in that I didn't read the menu all the way through. I expected some form of lettuce. But once I took a bite of the light vinaigrette frisee with the egg and chunk of bacon it was the perfect bite. Lastly for my entree I ordered the lamb three ways. The chop was amazing, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I actually asked for salt but did not need it;-) now the star of the show was this perfectly cooked and seasoned sausage. Juicy and oozing with flavor. When my wife saw my face while taking my first bite she asked me if I was having an orgasm... I did. I keep thinking about how amazing this was I am going to make sausage this week just to see if I can get close to what I had. The only disappointment was the lamb belly. Had amazing flavor but it just does not melt in your mouth like pork belly. Parts of it I had to spit out. Not because it tasted bad but because it was just not breaking down in my mouth. If it was lamb 2 ways it would have been flawless! I am looking forward to going back to try the rabbit the chef said it was his best seller unfortunately I was too chicken to order it. But after this meal I am sure it will be amazing. Thanks chef soft bringing this to Charlotte.",

The restaurant was not very busy on this Friday night, and our waiter knew the menu very well.  What was disappointing was our waiter's reaction to the fact that we all did not want a four-course meal.  When a few of us split a variety of small plates, his reaction was blatant disappointment and almost utter-shock.  It was very obnoxious.  Every single person at the table ordered at least two appetizers to split or an entree, as well as cocktails.  After ordering, we did not see our waiter for a while. Moreover, every single person I was with works for a large corporation based in the city.  Most of us get to select or suggest restaurants for work dinners.  Needless to say, Halcyon did not make it to the top of our list.  Treating a patron as if they are not ordering enough or their lack of spending is a disappointment keeps them from returning regardless of how good the food is.",

    "text": "Let me start by appology. On my mobile writing this review. I am not a foodie, or destination diner. I have been a chef for 30 years. When I do dine out of course expectations are high. This was for my wife birthday. We have been married for 32 years (yeah as long as I've been cooking). I will bypass the service, waiter was just sub par. Not bad but not great. On to the food. Menu is small plate driven which is what I wanted for us. Order a few and then some. Well, our waiter brought the first 2 courses on 2 boards. We were in no hurry, so why bring them at the same time? Then not even half way through the next one came. I asked waiter to take it back until we were done with first 2. My wife could see the kitchen and that were off set (they don't want it?).  Anyway, we enjoyed what we had. Baba gnouch and ceviche. both outstanding. Then the braised bison with a bunch of goodies and purees.(phenomenal). Does it get better? Next was the Kobe beef tartar with a perfectly cooked soft egg on top with croutons. ( chef note. Good but needed more mustard and capers, perhaps brandy). Then we asked for the menu to order one entree. My wife asked the waiter what he suggested. Bacon wrapped waaaabbbbbitttttt. She said sold. After first plates coming out toooooo fast. The waaabbbbiiiitttyyy took a long time. But it was totally worth the wait. (Again phenomenal). OK,now one bad for our waiter. We listen to another waiter totally blow his table away with dinner descriptions! Always us! Figures! Out waiter didn't even pour our wine during our stay. Really? Wtf. At 55 bucks at least make us feel welcomed. Then we had desert. Pineapple upside down cake with house made ice cream. (Both of us in bliss and I don't eat desserts at all). So you say does this review make merrit? I am a professor teaching culinary arts to the up and coming folks. My final tally, get me an awesome waiter, cause chefs food was too die for! P.s. hope someone shares this with the chef and his staff. Coudos brother!",

    "text": "Halcyon is one of those places you go when the boss is paying. So on such an occasion we decided to do just that.  I am not such an adventurous eater so I stuck to the basics. I ate the cheese burger and fries and it was delicious! The burger was so tender it fell apart, so I ended up eating it with a fork. The fries were delicious. Regular mixed with sweet potato and seasoned with rosemary!  For dessert I had the 'coffee and donuts'. The little donut holes were pretty good but the \"coffee\" was amazing. It was more like a chocolate mousse! Wonderful meal.  I will ask to go back on my next company paid lunch.   Forgot to mention, our waiter was wonderful!",

    "text": "Since I'm not from Charlotte and had only been once before, it took me and my date about 20 minutes to even find the restaurant. However, once we were directed in the right direction, we entered Halcyon just before our 9:30 reservation - it was NYE by the way. We were greeted by a most attractive hostess and were seated at the bar to wait a few minutes until the table prep was complete. Once we were seated, a very kind, funny & witty waiter took our drink orders and made us feel very welcomed, offering any help with the menu and NYE specials.   For the appetizer, we ordered two things - the charred peppers and a lobster cake that sat atop squid ink noodles. Fabulous. I loved the sweetness of the lobster's sauce and the savory ink noodles. The charred peppers were not very spicy and had a nice flavor. For our meal, my friend ordered the grouper that was a special that night, and I ordered the seared duck that is a menu regular. Both were absolutely amazing, and my date even said that it was definitely one of the best meals he has eaten at a restaurant. My duck was cooked perfectly, served with a side of creamed turnips...very interesting and delicious. For dessert we ordered the blackberry ice cream and it was also very good. ( I actually wanted more ;] )  Since we're not 21 yet, we didn't get the privilege of tasting the bar manager's drink specials for the night, but the group at the table next to us was talking about how good they were.  I am almost certain that nothing you order here will be bad. Definitely something to check out if you want delicious, unique food made entirely with local ingredients. I will absolutely be back.",

Approximately 85% of what you see on the menu is local and seasonal, making each dish fresh and unique. The menu is simple, and it changes daily to accommodate what's at the market.   I went for restaurant week with a group of friends. We were seated immediately and received very good service throughout the night. From the restaurant week menu, I ordered: the cheese plate with truffled-honey, the vegetable lasagne and the bread pudding for dessert. All three dishes were great. The decoration is truly beautiful, both ethereal and earthy. I felt like a wood-elf.",

Nature-inspired decor, soaring ceilings, and a great view of St. Peter's church give this restaurant an uncommon feeling.  Second, the service was terrific!  You sort expect a new restaurant to have to work out the kinks...not so at Halcyon.  Our waiter practically sang the menu and the wine selection to our table.  He was so knowledgeable about the food and wine pairings that making our selection was effortless.  Last but definitely not least, the food was fantastic.  Our table was comprised of 4 foodie friends so \"Chinese\" rules were in play...we sampled each other's appetizers, entrees, and desserts.  A lot of thought has gone into their menu and it shows.  We will return to see what Chef Marc is doing next.  Enjoy Halcyon!",

Great location, beautiful space, and a really comfortable and unpretentious atmosphere (unlike some museum restaurants).  This is a place that takes food seriously, both in the selection of their suppliers, the quality of the food they purchase, the way it is prepared, and even how it is presented and served.  Sitting at the bar, watching the open kitchen, was like watching a symphony orchestra perform.  All of the parts coming together with tremendous harmony and beauty.    The staff is incredibly friendly (even for Charlotte, where everyone is friendly to begin with).  They are also incredibly knowledgeable about every item on the menu, and every ingredient.  Not a single recommendation was bad.  The food was magnificent.  The artisan cheese tray, meat ball sampler, and special marrow appetizers were fantastic.  The bread was hot, fresh and tasty, as were the spreads.  The wedge salad is like no other, and the stone soup was an explosion of flavor.  The dinner (I had the duck, others had the burger and short ribs) was beautifully presented and endless in flavor.  And nicely proportioned.  Dessert also was great.  We had the brown betty and beignets.    Add in the short, but well rounded beer and wine list, and waitstaff that knew the list too, and you end up with what is, and should be, the best new restaurant in Charlotte, and perhaps just the best restaurant in Charlotte period.  I'm happy that I work nearby, and will be visiting often.",

What if Ronald McDonald had used this philosophy. I doubt they would have succeeded. Keep in mind it was 1pm. The selection was very very limited especially since they were out of most of the desirable items. That said I would be tempted to give it another chance. The tea was good and the food was fair. One more chance and that would be it for me. Z",

The atmosphere is great.  It has that green clean healthy wholesome earthy sanitary feel.  I love the big wooden chandeliers and the wooden table tops.  Everything was lovely and the big windows with a view of the city made it even better.  The service was ok.  It wasn't very busy but our server just didn't seem to have the best approach or ability to \"read\" his customers.  He didn't have good timing if I can put it that way.    We didn't receive any of this famous truffle popcorn I have been hearing about for months on end.  I guess because it was brunch we got the shaft, which sucks!  The food came out and everything was good but the portions were not even appetizer worthy.  I know with \"nicer\" restaurants you don't always get the biggest portions but I really don't think it is okay to pay twice as much for a couple bites.  I ordered the asparagus and lentil salad.  It had some feta and lemon vinaigrette and it was delicious!  But it was literally 5 bites.  No exaggeration.   Dad got the kale and sweet potato salad with salmon.  Again, there were 6 pieces of kale.  We counted.  It was tasty but it wasn't satisfying at all.  Mom got the grits with pork belly.  The pork belly seemed abnormally \"fatty\" if that is even possible but again...it was a toddler sized portion.    Husband won the prize for ordering the best option where he wasn't left with the need to go eat again after leaving.  He ordered some type of sandwich that would normally come with fries but he ordered fruit instead.  It was a turkey sandwich with really fresh bread...it was warm but not pressed down like a Panini...it was crunchy but yet soft.  It was very good!  Per my mom's request, we ordered the sorbet dessert thing.  It was blackberry with rum raisins.  It was also bland as hell.  Probably the worst dessert I have ever eaten in my dessert loving life.  Seriously!  Oh and there were no rum raisins.  We asked the server, he went back and found out that it was a mistake on the menu and they don't serve rum raisins with that dessert any longer.  He brought us out some rum raisins in a little cup so we could have them.  Nice gesture.  Unfortunately, the rum raisins were the primary reason we ordered the dessert so it was gross enough and then they took the best part out?  Hmmm...not wise.  Plus we had a piece of hair at the bottom of the dessert bowl which was nice and nasty.  Maybe we ordered wrong....maybe because it was their brunch portions, maybe this or maybe that...all I know is that I won't come back from brunch.  Not for that price and not for those portions.  I do want to try dinner but I am a little gun-shy at this point.",

The building is cool, there's a large staircase that leads up to the restaurant (could use better signage). The inside is clean, beautiful open view of downtown and partial skyline.   We walked in and it wasn't that busy, we were asked if we had a reservation, we did not, didn't realize we needed it. They seemed a little miffed but sat us about 5min later. We were both craving some serious vegetables after crazy traveling and wanted to up our vitamin levels. Ordered the ceviche but they ended up being out so we ordered a salad each. The menu makes the salads sound pretty grand but when the food came on giant plates there honestly wasn't much there...especially for the price. We were still kind of hungry so we ordered 1 more salad to split, the root veggie salad was pretty good but swimming in some kind of mayonnaise/yogurt sauce.   The service was OK and that's about it. It seemed like they've been directed to make this crazy presentation, and they can really drag it out over 1 page menu. They were polite but it was very stiff and awkward to listen to them speak. And again, for what you actually get food-wise it's overpriced. Everyone should get a 2nd chance but I do think I'll wait a while before I go back. There's plenty of other places to see first, in my opinion.",

Food was great and the presentation was wonderful.  Menu rotates so they don't always have the same food available but the flavors and even presentation was noteworthy.  As for drinks, wine selection was good and had some interesting drinks, one that included a piece of bacon!  Tasted a few drinks and they were okay but not worth the price tag.  Overall, recommended place but perhaps not as a frequent customer.  Pricing was way too high for what you get so for two people, 2 drinks each, almost $200.",

    "text": "Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 4.25 Stars  Yet another excellent lunch at Halcyon. This time with a group of young Engineers who haven't been here before. Although former Chef Marc Jacksina has left, the quality hasn't diminished, which is very good indeed! Their menu has seemed to expand somewhat as there are more and varied options, at least for lunch. Haven't been back for dinner in a while so that's on my \"to do\" list.  After mulling over the options (I LOVE their ground in-house burgers), I decided to get something different. I opted for their \"French Omelet\" as it was filled with fresh spinach, carmelized onions, garlic and chevre. That's it. Pretty basic. Having recently been trained on the PROPER way to make an omelet, I was curious to see how a professional chef pulled it off....especially at a restaruant as good as Halcyon.  Well, they pulled it off! A virtually perfect Omelet! After a light dusting of pepper and salt, the flavors were fresh and vibrant, and everything that is yummy about an omelet - light yet filled with the wonders of chevre and veggies! It went down very easily....  It was accompanied with mixed greens, which while fresh, were meh.   But I still taste that delicious omelet a couple hours after lunch. Now I can't wait to try and replicate this at home....we'll see how successful I am afterwards. LOL.",

It never got too loud or felt claustrophobic thanks to its wide open floor plan.   Service overall was good, albeit a little slow. The restaurant wasn't even full, yet my group and I felt like the length between ordering and each course was a tad long... we ended up devouring the food once it arrived (which speaks to the strength of the menu!).   I loved the seasonal menu and the way that it is structured - smaller appetizers and plates towards the top of the menu, with the larger entree-sized items towards the bottom/on the back. I went with a group from work and we each picked an appetizer + entree and shared at the table. It worked out perfectly that there were no duplicate orders and we got to try so many different things! Among my favorites - the ceviche, scallops and pork belly, and game sausage.   While it is on the pricey side, Halcyon is perfect for a work outing or special occasion. I hope to dine in again soon, especially once they introduce their spring/summer menu!",

The heirloom tomato salad was the star of the evening. Very fresh tomatoes, a bit of cream, pine nuts, and... bacon. That part surprised me and was OK, but I could have had 3 of these salads for my dinner.  Then on to the rabbit saddle. Not gamey, cooked perfectly, as were the carrots. Everything was plated beautifully.  One point off for the price ($75 for my salad, main, and a beer after tax/tip!). You can find this quality elsewhere for a bit less.",

    "text": "Wow, my experience at Halcyon really exceeded my expectations! After a visit to the Bechtler Museum on Friday, we decided to pop in to enjoy a late lunch.  The decor is awesome - earthy but upscale and the atmosphere is nice, but not overly stuffy or pretentious.    Our server started us out with water and a flavored popcorn that was savory and oddly addictive. I don't remember what the spices were, but the flavor reminded me of some sort of curry.  Yum.   I ordered the Poultry Junction Chicken (roasted chicken that was served on grit rice risotto w/ seasonal succotash & malabar spinach - $14) and my dining companion ordered the Duck Confit (on focaccia w/ cranberry marmalade, pomegranate, greens and sweet potato crisps - $14).  Both dishes were beautiful and absolutely delightful!   After our entrees, we decided we needed a little pick-me-up, so we both ordered cappuccinos (I think these were around $6).  They were served in enormous cups and were delightful.  Then, we splurged and ordered a hazelnut yule log dessert with a cherry root beer sorbet to share (around $8)... it was delish!   The food was great, the service was great, and you can't beat the beautiful view. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I hate giving restaurants bad reviews based on one experience, but on the particular day i went Halcyon earned a rating of \"I've experienced better.\"  The restaurant is located in the Mint Museum Uptown building, and the interior is beautiful. Ridiculously high ceiling, beautiful chairs and tables, huge windows. The prices on the interesting menu reflect all of this. Unfortunately the quality of the food itself did not justify the price.  I decided to order a cocktail and had to ask my waiter what happened to it when our food came before it. My friend had the trout salad, which we both thought needed something acidic to brighten it up. I had the elevated BLT: pork belly, lettuce, and fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese on a thick slice of brioche. I was surprised when it came out that it was served open faced rather than as a sandwich and this made it difficult to eat because it was hard to get all of the components together on a single fork. The brioche itself was cut so thick that I would have trouble fitting that alone in my mouth. But that was the least of my problems. One of the three pieces of pork was dramatically overcooked. Clearly and obviously so. I was shocked that the chef would let it out of the kitchen on an open faced sandwich where it was just staring at me. I asked the waiter to get a replacement and he said he would gladly take care of it. As I was waiting, I found a hair in my cheese. No big deal for me actually, but on top of everything else it just continued the downward spiral. To their credit, a replacement was brought out with what had to be the biggest piece of pork belly in the restaurant on it. And the manager brought the dish out and assured me that the dish would be comped. Kudos for that, but the whole dish was ill-conceived and poorly executed.  Sadly, my noontime cocktail was the highlight of my meal at Halcyon. \"Some Pig\" = Benton's Bacon Fat-Washed Maker's 46. Orange Bitters. Maple Syrup. Kosher Salt. For $13 it had better be good, and it was.  A final note: despite the beautiful setting, the toilet in the bathroom was disgusting. Since I at before noon on Saturday, it had clearly not been cleaned from the night before, though someone had obviously replenished the paper towels in there.",

    "text": "Another Charlotte Restaurant Week experience!  Again, it is my personal belief a participating restaurant should put their best foot (or dishes, for that matter) forward during restaurant week. It's two weeks out of the year, folks. Do it up and do it right.  That being said, I was absolutely jacked to try The Mint Museum's newest addition - Halcyon! Their fresh (no freezer on site) farm to table concept is just as lovely as their decor. Gorgeous twig chandeliers, lots of deep, rich browns, ocean blue wall, interesting silverware and more. Plus, that patio is going to be stunning during the warmer months. Service was friendly and efficient and we were in and out within an hour. I can, however, imagine staying a while once CRW is over.   The food, however, is where Halcyon fell a bit short of wondrous, both in flavor and in portion sizes. I see on their Yelp biz categories they listed small plates and new American, perhaps I should have paid more attention to the small plate mention.   Listen, I don't expect grandiose portions, but I left Halcyon hungry. That's sayin' a lot. Here's what I had:  Amuse Bouche - Hummus w/pita points: 3/5: This was actually a generous helping of hummus, especially for an amuse bouche. Our server brought us extra pita points because the heaping pile of hummus only came with three. Ha. I love carbs, I'd like some extra pita. I just wasn't wowed by the flavor of the hummus,  Farm Salad: 4/5: Local butter lettuce with a few sunflower seeds, tasty tomatoes and a delicious mustard vinaigrette. Great texture and full of color. I really, really enjoyed the dressing.   Short Rib: 3.5/5: Let me put this out there right away - I love the flavors on the plate. Loved the tender short rib, the tasty glaze, the potato puree and the root veggies. My problem with this dish? There wasn't much of it. At all. Three very small slices of short rib, two bites of potato and the equivalent of two baby carrots diced. Normally I offer hubs a few bites of my dish, but I didn't have any to share. Color me disappointed, but they said this was supposed to be a main course*? Maybe I got the runt of the short rib  - it was very short.   *In the same vein, hubs ordered the chicken and I chuckled when they set it down. The chicken was the size of a kiwi with a protruding bone.   Creme Brulee: 2/5: Very cold inside and the texture was pretty off. Not smooth, creamy and delicious as I had hoped. Plus, the flavor was lacking.   So, maybe I should have paid more attention to the small plate classification? I'll take a bit of the blame, but that could have been advertised a bit better on their CRW menu and website, for that matter. I know I'll come back to Halcyon as I really adore the concept, but I'll be sure to have a snack before I arrive.",

    "text": "Delicious \"Cold\" Duck & Creme Brulee!  I came here for work and a local recommended this place to me.  I was getting tired of eating pulled pork and fried chicken so I wanted to try something fresh.    The location of this place was kinda confusing because it has two street address, but in reality it should be one since it's basically inside the Levin Art Center.  We got lost a bit walking to this place because our navigation system couldn't distinguish where exactly it was.  Just remember you gotta go up the stairs of the Levin Art Center to get into the restaurant.    The place is fairly small, but modern.  The ambiance was definitely there since it was so dark my camera required a flash.   We started off w/a few appetizers.  I wanted to try the pate plate, but they ran out so I had the crepe & my coworker had the cheese plate.  Both were just okay, nothing spectacular, but the presentation was beautiful, just like the place.    Now the main entree was the highlight of the meal.  We both had the \"cold\" duck & it was spectacular!  We ordered the duck both medium rare & it came out tasting very flavorful & tender, the butternut squash & brussel sprouts really complimented the dish.  I fell in love w/it & couldn't stop raving about how great the dish was.  We ended the meal with their vanilla creme brulee & it was soOOo creamy & smooth.  It was THE best way to end the meal.   If I ever get a chance to come back to NC I'll definitely back here for their duck!  You gotta try it!",

I was never asked if I wanted to have something to eat, the place was not full there were only 4 busy tables including mine : 2 people in 2 of them and a lady on the other table.  2 waiters busy cleaning up tables, and a not very friendly hostess. I was starting to feel bad about being ignored until the person sitting at the table behind me stood up and screamed \"the service in this place is horrible\" and walked away. I finished my coffee, paid for it and left HUNGRY!  The place is beautiful, the location great, very nice views of the city and a spacious terrace but service is bad and unfortunately I cannot comment on the food because I did not have a chance to try it.

    "text": "This place is gorgeous.  Big windows, clean lines and rustic polished wood tables and wooden serving plates and bowls. Love farm-to-table.  Even the flatware is rustic, very \"from the Earth\".  The reason for the 3 stars versus 4 or 5 is the spotty service and food.   Depending on who is at the host/hostess stand, the welcome will range from indifferent to lukewarm.  I get this vibe from most of the servers too.  Minus points.   The food itself ranges from yum to unmemorable, and it too varies in consistency.  Shrimp and grits, a nice contemporary adaptation with spring vegetables and broth, but it was so salty, I couldn't finish.  Then, the basic salad of cucumbers and beets and buttermilk vinaigrette was so under seasoned, I wished for a salt shaker.    I've had the burger twice, and again, depending on who is on the line, a medium burger can sometimes come out pink in the center, while today, it came our well-done.  Their interpretation of the eggs benedict sounds so appetizing!  Lamb sausage, overnight tomato!  Goat cheese!  Duck fat hash!  But sadly enough, the lamb was tough.  The chevre spread so thin, it couldn't be tasted.  The hash was almost translucent, with no browning or seasoning.    The housemade ketchup though really is stellar. I'm told the freshness and honey are what make it stand out from Heinz.   The servers really run the gamut.  From today's server who forgot our iced teas and also forgot to put in our dessert order to such an attentive server we never went a minute without our teas being 3/4ths full.   I'd love to see Halcyon succeed, and perhaps it's beautiful location overlooking S. Tryon, and it's business clientele is enough.  But in order to really stand out as a go-to restaurant guests will want to frequent time and time again...more of an effort in service and tweaking details of the food itself need to happen.",

    "text": "This local farm to table concept by the folks at Something Classic, located at the front of the new uptown Mint Museum, is a new gem in the Queen City's crown.  Flavorful and well-prepared local ingredients shine throughout the menu.  Let me begin with the decor.  You know the new Mint is very modern, and this carries thru to Halcyon's dining room.  There are muted natural colors accented by an earth-toned blue that pops up in many unexpected places.  The idea of dining in nature is enhanced further by the naturally shaped dark wood tables and the \"twig\" chandeliers.  Indoor and outdoor seating, with a great view of Tryon St. and the new cultural campus, are abundant.  Ceilings are tall and the whole place has an airy openness to it.  I could come here and just sit to enjoy the room- luckily the food was just as good.  The wife and I dropped in for a bite on Saturday around noon.  To our surprise, they we rolling out a brand new brunch menu.  Plenty to choose from- soups, salads, omelets, and a handful of features.  Emphasis is placed on locally-sourced ingredients.  While we looked over the menu, our server brought by a few slices house-made baguette with a selection of homemade butters- pumpkin, cranberry, and red wine.  Interesting, but since the bread was already drizzled with olive oil we mostly skipped on the butters.  The wife went for the french onion soup and, while we have had many versions elsewhere in town, this was by far the most flavorful.  Carmelized onions and gruyere cheese in a rich beef broth further flavored with port.  Not too salty, not sweet, just filling and packed with flavor that shone thru every spoonful.  Served in a perfectly portion little coquette dish that came out piping hot.  Perfect for cold weather days.  I had a more traditional egg and toast breakfast- only the toast was more slices of the baguette and the meat was a house-made lamb sausage.  Totally could have eaten that sausage all day long- juicy and fresh tasting, with the flavor of lamb and spices mixing crazy good.  But the piece de resistance, not to be missed, is the duck confit hash.  Even our server noted it was a star on the menu.  The tiniest little cubes of potato, bell pepper and onion are cooked golden brown with a bit of duck fat.  Unusual and interesting, and oh so tasty.  Decadent for sure, but what a way to mark your ground on an otherwise crowded brunch scene.  We will be back to try more- sadly there was no room left to try the french toast, but our server mentioned it was made with their homemade pumpkin bread.  Sounds yum-o to me.    I did note they serve a number of beers and wines, both by bottle and by the glass.  I also inquired about their cheese plate- currently comprised of 3 choices- you can have 1 or all 3.  Though was passed on this trip, I do want to try the Carolina Blue- topped with truffled clover honey.  Sounds good enough to make a meal out of alone!  Overall, I have nothing but high expectations for Halcyon- everything about it ought to appeal to the modern Charlotte diner.  Well-thought out food locally-sourced and expertly prepared in a dining environment that is a treat in itself.    Hopefully the location is not a killer- but it ought to do a great weekday lunch business.  If you are in or around uptown, make this a must on your list.  I'm smitten for sure.",

    "text": "So beautiful! So amazing! New and creative menu items that scream farm-fresh and delicious and live up to their descriptions.  Their wine list is exceptional and their cocktails were tasty! (Although, I didn't care for the squid ink, but the server didn't bat an eye and whisked away, bringing me something new on the house!)  Although I've heard that service is sub-par, our server was amazing. Food came out with beautiful presentation and glasses were never empty. And we never once felt like sub-standard human beings that some pricey places can portray.  And did I mention it's BEAUTIFUL!? It's located in the museum which is a perfect fit for it. Tables and chairs and lamps that all had to have been made for that restaurant. Exquisite design. Even the lighting level was perfect.  This restaurant is definitely a treat, so we can't wait to save up and head back again.",

    "text": "The downpour did not stop us from heading downtown and finding a farm to table restaurant for my friend coming from Raleigh.  Tricia wanted a vegetarian option so she found Halcyon on the website.  Unfortunately when we arrived they had changed their menu (which is great based on what is available and seasonal, but it did not coincide with their website menu.   That being said the service and the wine was spectacular.  The server knew his wine and presentation was perfect.    The decor has always been intriguing to me whenever I have passed by to experience the Mint Museum.  What we found out last night is that the owner made the tables from fallen oak trees that came down in the yard.  They are gorgeous and make the experience great!",

Inside the place is beautiful with a rustic feel. Great place for pictures before or after your meal.   Servers were very polite and knowledgeable about the menu. I loved that everything on the menu is made or grown locally.   Our dinner was great!  If you like hot, I recommend the pepper appetizer.",

They had Gazpacho so I passed on the Stone Soup which changes almost every day as it would.    Last night my plan was to walk from the Mint Museum all the way down to Harvest Moon then come back to tour the Mint.  Then I remember Tonya P. (P for PopRock Photography aka POPROCK LOVE) told me that the Restaurant in the Mint was good and I should check it out... Being 90 + degrees outside and not really wanting to walk I looked at the menu posted outside.  As I was reading the menu a guy from inside came out to bring me in!  Boldness is to be rewarded!!!  As my server (who did an excellent job) was explaining the menu and I was crossing off (in my mind) almost all of it, then what I wanted I saw.... Gazpacho I knew I was staying!!!  Tomatoes and Watermelon Excellent!    Next Bread and Butter, both very good the Butter was a small slab of two butters, one half was Honey Dijon and the other half was lemon.  Burger was Filet Mignon and Short Ribs ground in house so I ordered it Medium RARE!!!  That's right!!!  Plenty of photo's though no bloody ones tonight!  This burger had some chow chow with it and was supposed to have Aioli (I hate Mayo) and some Cheddar (skip the Cheese) So they added Red Onion!!!  The fries were three different Potatoes one was sweet all were Very Good!  No tomato jam???  They need to make their own Tomato Jam!!!  Or a Moroccan Spice Sauce!  I did not eat the the Burger Bun in case I wanted to order multiple desserts and my waiter did not want to tell me about dessert til he thought  I was ready (I was ready at Lunch time [this is Dinner Time Now]).  Disappointingly they only had one that sounded good, sounded good after I made ten changes and requested (see my photos and you'll see their talent)!  Beignets (they called them Doughnuts) and something like Espresso Pudding ( they called Coffe and spelled Coffe on my bill).    Everything was very Good and if this were not a five yelp star experience it was close enough for me!  I'll be back I have to taste that Stone Soup and the Onion Soup looked very good too!",

I'd say our brunch was on the pricier side but not outrageous- especially if you're looking for something nicer.  The portions were much larger than I expected.  I got the Pork Belly BLT (and added a fried egg) it was outstanding!  I couldn't even finish it- my husband did though!  Of the 3 orders, this was definitely the largest.   The decor is beautiful- a perfect cross between rustic and modern.  Definitely a great restaurant for a special occasion!  We will definitely not hesitate to go back.",

Christina offered great suggestions, including the pork belly, the egg plant humus and deviled eggs (are you kidding me!) and the great wine list. Russian River wines never disappoint.  Every dish seemed to have great contrast: whether it was sweet and vinegary, crispy and rich, or savory and tart.  Attention to detail elevated this restaurant. It deserves to be in the Mint museum of art. Northerners and Foodies take notice.",

It is a different menu featuring locally-sourced ingredients, it is a restaurant you Evolve into once you can appreciate good, clean food...while I feel like a dork for that comment...if you can appreciate the difference of getting bar food and going to a dining experience...you will know what I mean...   In a city that is really starting to be recognized for it's culinary chefs and accolades...this place has all the cool, sexy and ambiance a girl could want, hello...and it is in a Museum...so gentleman...there is your hint...wanna impress a gal?

We started with the scallop & belly, sausge with beans / bacon and the greens in phyllo.  The scallops were cooked perfectly with a nice sear on either side.  The belly was a large portion for an app and was very delicious. The greens in phyllo was also very flaky and flavorful. The sausage dish was like a great comfort dish, very warm and filling.  For dinner, we split the NC flounder which was flaky, flavorful and a lighter way to finish off this meal.  No room for dessert, although some of the choices looked amazing. Will be going back during another visit to Charlotte.",

    "text": "Everyone has mentioned the great decor and cool wood tables, so I won't gush about the lovely ambiance and great views.  Onto the food! The first time I went here I went with a client and wasn't hungry so I just had the side salad that was A-MA-ZING! The dressing and inventive topping is always interesting. Whether its almond brittle or kettle corn, it's delicious and somehow works.  The greens are satisfying and just all around a great salad. Yes, I'm talking about a side salad. I also had the french onion soup (seasonal) which was fantastic.  Another time we went for brunch/lunch while museum hopping and had an awesome sweet potato waffle and the burger. Personally, I seriously think it's the best burger in town. Juicy, perfectly pink, flavorful. It had fried green tomato, jalapeno cheddar and a chow relish that didn't sound good from the menu but my husband ordered it and it worked perfectly. YUM!  They also have a lot of locally grown stuff on the menu.   Another time I brought my mother from the wine country here and even she was impressed.  I would definitely recommend this place, especially for out of towners. Well-executed southern gourmet and the best burger for lunch in town. (only comment is the dinner burger seemed expensive and had extra stuff I wouldn't want) Another nice surprise from the Something Classic folks. It's shocking that the people who brought the best vegetarian restaurant in town also has the best cow burger.",

Chicken pastille was flaky but the \"mole\" sauce was anything but mole. It was very cinnamon flavored. Not tasty or spicy. Traditional mole is complex with chili  and bitter chocolate    Lamb chops were delicious with wheat berries.   Veggie wrap and Fries  were awesome.   Overall, I Wouldn't visit again.

    "text": "Halcyon - where to start? First I must admit my expectations were high to begin with...  When you first climb the grand stone stairs and see their outdoor space, you think, this is going to be good! The view is stellar, partial skyline, a beautiful church, museum architecture and the sculpture I call \"silver parrot man\".  The main dining room is crisp, shiny and beautiful. The floor to ceiling windows are pretty much amazing. The open kitchen is neat and tidy with line chefs prepping food; I bet working here full time with that view makes you feel good.  Lyonnaise Salad: Poached egg on Frisee with Benton's bacon. I did not realize until later that the mustard vinaigrette was missing. So, runny yolk on undressed lettuce. The pieces of bacon were quite fatty, chewy and had a way too potent smokiness for my tastes. Would the vinaigrette have made things better? Maybe, maybe not.  A little acidity might have blended and pulled the components together a little better. I did not enjoy this dish.  Vegetable Phyllo: Sundried tomato, feta and walnuts wrapped in a phyllo. It was still warm and well-seasoned. Much better!  Ceviche: This was an excellent dish. The flavors were spot on. Scallops, yellowtail and shrimp with the perfect amount of citrus. The rice/shallot crackers were a nice complement to the dish.  The good: Everything looked pretty and was nicely plated.  The meh: The portions were small. I'm all for serving food on cutting boards, but they're starting to look a little too \"well-travelled\" - too many marks distract you and pull your focus from the actual food. The dressing was missing - \"rookie mistake\".",

    "text": "\"Some cultures are defined by their relationship to cheese.\" -- Benny & Joon (1993)  Wow this place is gorgeous. I mean, it seems a shame to actually eat in this place. I feel like I should be dressed up and drinking champagne and looking at the decor. But truly, it isn't like that at all - talk about first impressions being off.  Another business trip dinner and this place was highly touted on Yelp (thanks, guys!). So my co-workers and I made our way over after making a reservation. Uptown was not close to where we were working, so we made a later reservation. Luckily, they took us early.   We ordered cocktails immediately and started sipping and deciding on the menu. I got the Sow Not - a rye cocktail that was not at all sweet - yay! We did our usual ordering of the cheese board - 3 cheeses, one was local. The server rattled them off so quickly that I have no idea what they were. One was a blue goat - I was not a fan at all. I think that was left on the board as my friend Mike hated it too. The others were devoured.  As for dinner - here is what we ordered: Bleu cheese souffle - Mushroom Veloute. Roasted Shallot. Cognac Duck breast - Foie Gras Boudin Blanc. Sweet Potato. Spiced Turnips. Brussels Piedmontese Ribeye - Spring Onion. Garlic Scapes. French Horn Mushrooms Swordfish - Shrimp. Razor Clams. White Mirepoix. Potato Saffron Rouille. Persillade  Charlie ordered the souffle as he was not having any of the cheese plate - he was a big fan. I had a taste and enjoyed it immensely.  The veloute was rich and creamy without being too heavy while the souffle was the right hint of cheese without being over powering.    Our entrees were both hit and miss. The duck duo was Charlie's - he loved the breast, but the boudin - which was like a sausage - had an odd texture and he really disliked it. The rest of the plate was good for him, but he could not get past the foie at all. So over all it was 2.5 stars. The Swordfish was Mike's - he enjoyed it but it was heavier than he was expecting. He rated his higher than Charlie did his. The razor clam was a hit, as was the swordfish. The sides were just okay. 3.5 stars.  As for the ribeye - they did a song and dance about this beef and honestly, it tasted like every other cut of beef I have had. Nothing special - not greass-fed or anything. Seriously, the server did go on about it being local and special. I could not tell. It was delicious, and cooked properly. I enjoyed the scapes and mushrooms - but it was not worth the upcharge for fancy beef. 3.5 stars.  Since we were all disappointed in our entrees - we ordered desserts: Brown butter cake with roasted pineapple Layered chocolate cake with hazelnuts French toast & gelato  Obviously I could not taste the chocolate cake, but both the brown butter cake and french toast were good - again, nothing to write home about. I would have liked the cake to be more moist. Mike loved his chocolate cake.  Overall service was good, at times a little slow, but not too annoyingly so. We were in no hurry. Oddly, a table came in not once, but twice, sat and looked over the menu and then left. This is a place where posting the menu outside the front door might help. It is odd to be a patron and watch that happen a couple of times. Trust me - this menu is not for everyone.",

We were seated and given a menu of \"small plates\" and \"the stuff that's bad for you (desserts)\". We ordered the Espresso Cake and the Strawberry Cake and shared them.  THE STRAWBERRY CAKE. This is not your average cake. The soft cake is pink with an amazing vanilla cream center with pieces of strawberries mixed in. This is the best cake I've ever had in my life.  The Espresso Cake is also amazing. Genoise sponge with espresso cream and chocolate? Wha's better than that. It also comes with a semifreddo that tastes just a frozen mouse. It's served on top of a crumble that reminded me of some of America's favorite candy bars. The pastry chef is extremely talented and is creating works of art that belong on the inside of the museum.  The only con is that our waiter joked about how the pastry chef only makes \"healthy\" things, hinting that dessert is \"bad\" for you, etc. If only he knew I came to celebrate my 21st birthday with a piece of cake after battling a 4 year eating disorder...",

Not necessarily head over heels soulmate kind of in love, but they possess a certain addicting charm and alluring personality that draws you in, and keeps you wanting to know more. There's something, or possibly everything, about Halcyon that gave me that instant, gratifying attraction.   The place is small and quaint, but everything in between borderline perfection. The staff is friendly and inviting while the decor warm and classy.  The lights dimmed as the earthly theme is braced with wooden carved tables, a stone fountain and strategically placed branches as decor. The patio seating provides a certain romantic je ne sais quoi with the beautiful view and lit candles lingering on the tables. The plates resemble turquoise earth stones while the drinks original and seasonal. The menu is innovative, creative and most importantly, passionate. The passion is what keeps me addicted, yearning to know more. Even at a quick glance you could instantly see the passion that was put into developing Halcyon, as every single detail was unique, exquisite and dare I say.. perfect. I left with a new found lover, who is fittingly my 100th milestone review.   Recommendations: 1. ANY of the mixed drinks, but loved Spicy Peach Toddy and Queen to Bee. 2. Hamachi 3. Scallops with Pork Belly",

To the right of the tzatziki sauce is citrus cured salmon which was in all honesty the freshest salmon that has reached my mouth! The next picture was my main course which was an amazing brussel sprout salad drizzled in a sweet and flavorful glaze!

This is the perfect place to take out-of-town guests. It's right on the edge of Uptown Charlotte, connected to the Mint Museum. The space itself is beautiful. The large windows bathe the restaurant in light, and the decor is curated just as well as the adjacent art museum.   If you don't have a reservation -- even for lunch -- expect the host to do that thing where you grit your teeth and inhale sharply. They always make it seem as though you may be out of luck, but in all my visits I've never had to wait to be seated. Clearly, though, they would prefer you call ahead.  The food is wonderful. It's not so upscale as to be intimidating or inaccessible, but everything is presented delightfully and cooked to perfection. My favorite lunch is the Seafood Bouillon. It's got a little bit of everything, and it's light enough that it feels appropriate even in warm weather. I've also had the Braised Bison, which is exceptional, and the Spicy Consomme with Pork Belly and a Poached Egg.   When I've inquired about dining gluten free, I have always had a helpful and knowledgable tour through the menu. I've never felt on edge about maintaining my GF diet here.   The only thing I don't love about Halcyon is the napkins. They're a crepey, metallic fabric that slides off your lap and isn't the slightest bit absorbent. They don't compliment the decor very well. I thought for sure after my first visit in Halcyon's early days that the napkins would be replaced with something more traditional, but they've held on. But, really, this is the worst thing I can say about this restaurant. Make the trip, and you won't be disappointed.",

We started out with a meat and cheese board. We got such a range of meats and cheeses and it was all fresh and delicious! Exquisite with style. The restaurant was beautiful as well, with wooden tables and a beautiful view of uptown.  I ordered the Spanish Turbot and it was cooked to perfection. The gnocchi accompanying it was delectable, and filled with flavor (even though it was made from pastry dough rather than potato!). It was accompanied with asparagus and that was bursting with flavor. For dessert I ordered the Mint Museum Financier with a scoop of chocolate icecream. Just, wow. Rich and delectable. Every bite was perfectly executed with flavor, especially the presentation. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a five star meal. A+",

Food was well cooked and fresh tasting but perhaps under seasoned. I also had their fresh squeezed orange juice (which was fantastic). I was one of only 2-3 other tables and the service and attention was appreciated. I would come here again but not power walk or run here as I'm really not sure what I crave there or would order (although it would definitely not be the same as my first meal).

    "text": "I was in Uptown Charlotte for a few days with work and found this place on yelp. After scanning the reviews and the menu, I decided to give it a try.   The location is convenient and I was able to park on the street out front for free. The restaurant is located just inside a museum and this is pretty neat. Inside, the decor and ambiance is really warm and welcoming.   I was a little under the weather, so no drinks for me, but the cocktails list did have a few options that sounded intriguing (bacon infused bourbon).   For food, I toyed with getting the burger, but ultimately settled on the soup of the day and the restaurants take on shrimp and grits.   The soup was a duck confit minestrone which sounded delicious. The soup arrived in what amounted to a small sized tea cup. I'd estimate most people could down this portion in 4-5 gulps. The soup itself was very flavorful and satisfying. No complaints there. For the price, I guess that's ok, but to me the portion was about half of what it could be. Soup ingredients are not that pricey after all.   For my \"main\" course, I decided against a larger entree and ordered the shrimp and grits off the small plate section. The grits were billed as kimchee fried rice grits with seasonal vegetables and a fried egg, which sounded awesome. The plate arrived, and I was surprised to see a much larger portion than I expected based on the prior soup offering. The plate included 3 good sized shrimp and the vegetables included mushrooms, Brussels sprout leaves, green beans, black eyed peas, and some other stuff. All of the ingredients looked beautiful and fresh. For some reason, this dish fell flat for me. Some of the individual items had great flavor (shrimp were excellent), but the composed dish just seemed off to my pallet (and I love kim chee). I wouldn't say it was bad, just not what I was expecting it to taste like based on the description. The waitress said it was one of their more popular items, so take my opinion fwiw.   Overall, I was glad I stopped in but I was not blown away. Service was quick and attentive. The prices are typical for a high end restaurant and many of the other menu items sounded really tasty. Maybe I'll give some other items a try the next time I'm in the area.",

    "text": "Dinner there this past weekend. Ive waited three days to write a review to allow some distance from the evening and see if I feel better about it. I don't.  Our reservation for four were for 7:pm. We arrived promptly and were all very excited, we had been planning this dinner for a while. We requested a table on the porch and were seated and addressed by the waiter quickly. The table ordered a full bodied bottle of Pinot Noir wine on the recommendation of the waiter, when it arrived it was the label he recommended but (even by his own admission) the wine didn't have a taste profile that met the expectation he set. It was good but a thin light Pinot with little body and not what we anticipated. We kept the bottle to be cordial and it was enjoyed in spite of the mistake. Not a big deal...  We ordered our appetizers at about 7:30. We received them at about 8:20 (they had one large table but were not full by any means) this could have been forgivable had the appetizers not arrived staggered leaving two plates undelivered and two sitting on the table. When they all finally arrived the food was great.  While waiting for the main course I went to the restroom. The mens room was filthy. The back of the toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days. Ive seen dive bars with cleaner facilities. The wall has black scuff marks obviously from people using a foot to flush the toilet. The tiny trash can was overflowing and the floor had water (I hope) all over it. I couldn't believe it possible for a restaurant of this caliber to allow their facilities to be so poorly kept. I returned to the table and we began the wait for our dinners. They arrived another 45 minutes after the appetizers (it was past 9pm). Our Dinner portions were meager and all of the entrees lacked vegetables or greenery of any kind. It was clear the focus was on form over food. The plating was beautiful but the meal itself was so so.  By the time we finished eating and were ordering dessert it was almost 10pm. We were given an apology by the waiter (who aside from the wine mistake, was fantastic). The manager also stopped by for a moment to apologize however the four chocolate truffles he sent to the table as an apology for dinner turning into a three + hour event were hardly a compensation for the wait, the wine issue, the mediocre dinner, or the condition of the facilities. For the price we paid (in time as well as money) the value simply isnt there in my opinion. Perhaps they just had an off night... I know we certainly wont take the risk again to find out, there are too many great places to eat in downtown.",

While it didn't really look like a souffle (it looked more like a cheese, mushroom and onion pudding with a popover in it), the taste was absolutely delicious.  I like that they have small plates (mine was only about $10).  My sister ordered the vegetable phyllo.  I was glad to have just a taste, because I didn't like it as well as the blue cheese souffle.",

Our water glasses got low and were occasionally refilled.  We received our food, from who I think is supposed to be our waitress (not sure since we never see her again).  The bill was delivered by what my fellow diner thought was supposed to be our waiter.  We waited some more to have our check taken.  I was late to my 2pm meeting.  Not sure why the slow service.  The were not terribly busy.  We were one of 5 tables filled.  The food was delicious.  I had the burger and my fellow diner had the Bahn Mi.  We thoroughly enjoyed both.

With that done, the three of us enjoyed the ham hock and sweet onion soup.  A light smokiness from the hocks complimented the sweetness of the onions. My oyster po'boy had perfectly fried oysters and plenty of them.  A bit too much bread for a po'boy but we are in the mid-Atlantic.  My co-diners had a burger and the Monte Cristo; thoroughly enjoyed.  All of us commented on how well the fresh French fries were seasoned. Following, we loved the pots du creme that came with the coffee and donuts in fresh raspberry puree and the chocolate espresso torte.  A bit disappointed with the pear upside down cake that was more of a upside down muffin topped with pear compote. The waitstaff was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and jovial.  We will continue to love this place!",

The ceviche has a bland marinade which overwhelmed the fish, but at the same time did not provide any unique or exciting sensations for the taste buds. The fish was fresh and in no way would you say it was bad, but it was not worth ordering again. The tartar was pretty much the same as the ceviche. It was there, it was not bad, but it failed to excite. For the entree we had the rabbit, as recommended by the waiter and the boar bolognese. These were a step up from the appetizers, but again failed to create the \"I can't wait to go back\" experience I was hoping for.  All the ingredients were there, but it was not assembled in such a way as to make a great experience. I am not a True foodie, in that I do not know how to tell them what they need to do different.  I am fortunate enough to experience many great culinary opportunities, but this was not one.",

    "text": "Love the concept, but the implementation still needs more work. My man made dinner resevations for my birthday here, attempting to combine my love of farm-to-table restaurants and the Charlotte museum distract. STRIKE 1 - When asked, the hostess refused to surprise me with a birthday dessert claiming that it was against restaurant policy. He didn't want any singing, clapping or any obvious display, just a dessert with maybe a candle. She didn't even offer an alternative solution. Anyways, when we arrived (looking smashing by the way), the hostess sat us behind a huge center piece island of a thing which blocked the view of the city. There were plenty of empty tables by the window but instead she sat us at a cramped 2 seater behind this huge thing. That was STRIKE 2. The food was ok. I had the gnocci's and scallops and he had the pork chops. The gnoccis lacked flavor I thought and the pork chops, rather tough. What we will both remeber is the pork belly tapas -- it was a small portion, but excellent.   Now for STRIKE 3. For drinks I ordered the Cool Chihouly which is described as a \"Strong coffee. Cruzan coconut rum. Godiva white chocolate liquer. Dash of house chocaolate ganache.\" I tasted no coffee, no rum, no Godiva liquer . . . just tasted the dash of chocolate and ice. No problem I thought. I'll simply tell the server I did not care for it and will ask for something else. It's my birthday afterall and I would like a drink. I order the Night at the Museum gin and tonic, but to my surprise, the server hands the drink to my boyfriend and says, \"Well maybe he will like it and finish it for you,\" and then leaves. Weird. Ok, my man is not one to pass on a speciality drink so he takes a sip and doesn't like it for the same reason I don't. When the server returns, he makes it clear he doesn't want it and asks instead for a Jack and Coke.",

I ordered a 40 dollar steak and crab entree that was fatty and had no flavor. Two others in my group ordered grouper fish that they thought was lousy. The last two ordered a vegetable plate that one said was terrible and one said was good. The appetizers of oysters and flatbread were excellent and the service was good. To give the place credit they did give us a big discount when we told them we thought the food was lousy. So they avoid one star because they do good business. However it is a higher end place and for the price Halycon does not deliver on quality. The food is disappointing and it was honestly maybe the worst steak Ive ever eaten. They even try to gourmet up the bread with this gross butter contraption that stinks. Overall Halycon tries to be elegant but there food is lousy and Id rather eat somewhere with better food.  They do have a unique menu but I think its overly unique to the point that its ridiculous especially when the food doesnt deliver. I wont be going back if Im in Charlotte again and if you want a good meal Id look elsewhere. Good service and they do good business so have to give them credit there but it just cant make up for how lousy the food tastes.",

Most the ingredients they use are local and are made on the premises.  Their home made butter was amazing, especially the one infused with sweet potato!    As far as the entrees, the portions definitely won't overwhelm you.  Their lunch menu was one of the most creative ones I had ever seen!  Salad with bacon, mustard caviar, with a side of blue cheese ice cream?  Crepes stuffed with mushroom and goat cheese?  Super inventive and delicious, and I wish I could have tried each entree.    It simply was not an option to leave without getting dessert, so we decided on the \"coffee and doughnuts\" which were tiny beignets in raspberry sauce with a side of a thick, dense custard creme with espresso, orange, and chocolate flavors.  I liked the creme more than I did the tiny beignets, although I wish they would have put more than 3 of those little doughnuts, as  the portions are definitely discouraged sharing (Get Yo Own Beignets!)    To top off the elegant fare, the lunch prices are reasonable for what you get (about $11 on average per entree) and the service was great.  Our waitress did not hesitate to make recommendations and ask us for feedback since they are still a new restaurant.  The decor on the inside paired excellently with their earthy theme as well, and the view from the patio had a nice view of Uptown Charlotte.  If you are going to the mint or are looking for a dining experience I would definitely recommend a visit to Halcyon!",

For those of you flinching away from the screen at that, I mean that in the best way possible. Halycon has the look of an upscale, trendy restaurant but what they actually bring to your table is amazing quality food prepared with love. Wonderful bread to start with and delicious \"mixologist crafted\" cocktails to wash it down. All of us ordered some variety of fish with heirloom tomato salads and they were fantastic. Great deserts too, I really enjoyed the creme brulee but my friend's house made sorbet was incredibly tasty too. The service at Halcyon is impeccable too. I ordered a ginger/honey cocktail that I hated and the waiter, noticing my grimace, brought me a new, fresh drink (one of the same that a friend was having) free of charge. Great views, service, and drinks make Halycon a must visit in Charlotte (and don't forget to stop in to take in the sites of The Mint while you're there).",

All of my companions had great selections. The house salad was large and fresh , the quiche interesting, and the trout BLT interesting but not what I would have expected.   Halcyon prides itself on its locavore status and it shows. I don't understand the complaints about price.

    "text": "Went to Halcyon on a Friday evening.  The space is spectacular.  It is very comfortable, and the view is great.  The chairs are cushiony and comfy, but they're just a little too short for the tables.  I saw many elbows up in the air while people tried to cut they're meat entrees.  There is an outdoor seating area that will be excellent for summer meals.  It provides wonderful views of the new museums, cultural center, performance center, and the Green.    The staff at Halcyon are excellent.  Our server was very happy to be working, and he just loved food.  He took that love and put it all toward his interactions with us and other guests.  DH and I each ordered a glass of wine.  I had a glass of Malbec, which was quite good.  The restaurant serves small pieces of toast and compound butters at the beginning.  The toast was super dry and a little too toasty.  Not much flavor.  The butters were fine, but the bread distracted from the flavor infused into the butter.  Not worth taking up space in one's stomach on this free bread.  They should really get rid of it, because I was too full to order dessert in the end.   Anyway, I tried the gazpacho, the soup of the day.  It was extremely fresh, very tasty.  It didn't go well with what I had chosen for my dinner, but I couldn't resist ordering it.  My entree was the duck.  The squash and other winter vegetables were a nice complement to the well-cooked, medium-rare duck.  The portion size was appropriate.  The duck, itself, didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was still good.  As of April 15, Halcyon is still on its winter menu.  Our server said they'd be changing over to spring soon.",

They change their menu all the time so I had the  Charred Octopus(I said surprise me with the appy I was surprised and it was awesome )  and pastrami rubbed short ribs.  Everything was awesome.  If I am ever back I will visit again.  Funny I could not find the place since there is no sign outside and its on the second floor.  I was looking around and saw someone in Cook Whites with the word Halcyon so I asked the beautifully sleeved man where the place was.  He told me (found out that it was Mark)  Nice eye candy to boot.   Eat here,  NYC taste and quality in NC.  My server Andrew was also awesome  Superb wine list",

We started off with the cheese plate for 2 which was the most perfect start to our delicious dinner and the Alore Amore cocktail.  The drinks on the Libations menu are outstanding and very interesting - I wanted to try them all but that would not have been a good idea!  For dinner I had the fresh grouper served with black risotto, grilled bok choy and pearl onions and my husband had the 10 oz bone-in pork chop serves with brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes.  We didn't have time for dessert as we had plans to see the Nutcracker but we cannot wait to go back and try out their desserts.  We were thoroughly impressed by the food and service and we look forward to going back and would highly recommend this as a great place to have a pleasant dinner!!",

I highly recommend going with a group of close friends (as I did) and have each person order a different cocktail on the menu so that you can all taste a little of each.  Out group came close, save one or two, and each cocktail was deliciously different from the next.  We stuck with the smaller plates and appetizers and all were delicious compliments to our drinks.  Such a beautiful setting... be sure to call ahead and reserve a \"tree trunk\" table - literally a cross section of a tree that makes a beautiful backdrop to delicious food and drink.

We were seated immediately and they brought us some small biscuits to eat as we decided what to order.  I ordered the banana pecan French toast and my husband got the shrimp and rice grits.  We shared both dishes half and half.  The food came out pretty quickly and both dishes were terrific.  If I had to choose a winner, I would pick the banana pecan french toast.  It was simply divine.  The prices are a little on the high side, but you have to remember that this restaurant uses farm fresh and local/some organic ingredients  so you get what you pay for - and the service is terrific.  5 stars.",

We decided to have 3 courses each. For appetizer she had the seasonal ceviche and I the lyonnaise salad. The ceviche was super fresh and well executed and served with wonderful, thick-cut homemade tortilla chips and a smear of fresh avocado. The lyonnaise salad was made in the classic style but also well executed.   For entrees I had the braised short rib and she had the pork belly. Again both very well done and not easy things to do perfectly. The pork belly way beautifully crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The short rib was perfectly seasoned and so buttery tender that we used a fork.   For dessert she opted for their homemade ice cream (gingerbread) in a homemade cookie shell and I the lemon berry panna cotta. Both were perfectly creamy and the flavors were spot on but I must say the panna cotta was amazing! Thankfully my mom enjoyed The gingerbread ice cream so much that I got to hog the panna cotta for myself.   Between the food and the excellent and attentive service this place is definitely five stars. It is a great place for special occasions or just a night out with friends.",

Very nice glassed in restaurant that offers unusual items, arty presentations (no surprise for an art museum) and comfortable seating that looks out and down on Tryon Street.  Just come in the museum front entrance by the gift shop and take the escalator upstairs to this loft-perched cafe/restaurant.  There were three of us catching up on a long-time-no-see chance to get together.  It was lunch.  Coffee is very rich and strong so eating something, like the Trio Snack is great.  We had the snack along with an olive bowl and eggplant baba.  Nice munchies allowing conversation to flow without being gross with an open mouth.  The lunch plates were a farmer lunch, trout salad and grouper salad.  Those salads were the meat with salads, not all one pile of food in a bowl.  The meals have a gourmet touch to them.  They are and certainly appear to be prepared by a professional kitchen.  This ain't no fast food joint by any means.  A little pricey, but well worth it in quality, presentation and ambiance.  A very nice place for a romantic rendezvous?  Yep.  Only problem is that if you are sneaking around keep in mind that you are sitting in a cage of glass open to anyone walking by.  Great place to go if you are uptown or, especially if you are visiting either of the two museums that are side-by-side.  Parking is in a city lot directly across the street.  Very convenient.",

There is a side entrance you use. The decor is very nice and the chairs were very comfortable haha.   We got the smoked duck and shared a plate of eggs benedict. We also got a scoop of their ice cream, peach buttercream, two handrolled truffles, and the peach cobbler. Yes, we got a lot of dessert.   The smoke duck was pretty good, still had duck flavor, tender. Came with a very hard biscuit pita type bread and mustard seed spread on the side. It all combined to be very tasty. The eggs benedict were great! Eggs were perfectly cooked and spilled all over the rest of the stack once pierced and everything combined perfectly. The ham used was maybe a tad salty but the spinach balanced that out.   The peach buttercream was very good, had a more icy texture but was still smooth so maybe that's what they were going for? Handrolled truffles were amazing, the outside powder was bitter chocolate powder and combined perfectly with the sweet dark chocolate truffle inside. The truffle was extremely smooth and was quite big haha. The peach cobbler was a deconstructed one with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, peaches in a sauce, and then cobbler on the bottom. It was actually one of the best peach cobblers/pies I've ever had because the crust/bottom was so good. It was like the outside part of the crust but all over. You definitely need the ice cream to bring the full flavor out. We ended up putting the rest of our peach buttercream scoop in there with the cobbler.   Prices are a little steep so be prepared for that. Not sure how much the duck was, under $10 i think, eggs benedict were about $16, 1 scoop of ice cream was $3, truffles were $3 each i think, cobbler was around $10. Total bill including tip came out around $50, so not too bad, but not definitely not cheap so don't think you'll be going to the usual museum cafe.",

Traveling on business, I end up having dinner alone periodically, so I love restaurants with comfortable bar seating and a high quality menu. This place is both beautiful and ambient. The the service was on point but the real star here are the magic elves in the kitchen. The food was absolutely amazing. I ate everything! I started with the bacon bourbon drink which was good but a little sweeter than anticipated. Next i ordered 2 small plates as my appetizers. The shrimp and octopus salad with the citrus saffron vinegrette (delish) and the scallop and pork belly ( this dish was unbelievably good, up there on my list of best things I ever ate and that means a lot as I travel quite a bit across the country and have had my fair share of good food.) I really could've been done after those two plates as the portions were a little larger than the small plate restaurants I'm used to. But nonetheless my entree came because i ordered all 3 at once. I went with the Duck breast with roasted cauliflower, grilled peaches, and goat cheese. Again show stopper of a meal.  I couldn't put my fork down! So glad the bartender at the restaurant reccomended it as his favorite entree. I am here until Saturday and if it wouldnt be so embarrassing I would literally go there again tomorrow for dinner :)",

Add great food and delicious wine, you have a little sanctuary here.   The service was on point; friendly, efficient, prompt and accommodating...all things that make me happy. Halcyon sits atop the extraordinary Mint Museum offering a beautiful view of the downtown Charlotte area and just a few steps away from some of the city's most amazing art forms.   I wanted to keep it light so I opted for the Spinach Salad which included goat cheese, hard boiled egg, sunflower seeds, roasted mushrooms and succulent scallops paired with Chateaumar, a French red wine silky and divine! I am highly addicted to dark chocolate and absolutely love truffles so dessert was a no brainer....an adorable truffle board garnished with fresh berries and powered sugar, also perfectly paired with a glass of Chateaumar.  Needless to say I did not want to leave Halcyon. EVER. I will be on the lookout for locations in other cities. If you are on a budget bypass Halcyon, my lunch alone was $50 before gratuity.   ~Christy",

Dined here on a Tuesday night with reservations at 6:15 pm....the place quickly filled up! The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress, Maria B. was absolutely wonderful.  She provided detailed answers to our extensive list of menu-related questions and checked in the perfect amount of times.  I started off with the chai hot toddy (light on the star anise) ($14)...it was good, but not great. I think I was expecting a stronger flavor and it could have been a bit warmer.  My entree made up for whatever this libation was lacking!  I went with the Rabbit Rabbit ($34), which consisted of bacon wrapped saddle (very tender and flavorful), rabbit leg confit, hominy (similar texture to potatoes- made from whole corn kernels) in addition to butternut squash and turnips. The pairing of the ingredients allowed the flavors of the meat to shine through.  The portion was quite large (definitely have leftovers) and had a beautiful presentation. For dessert, I chose the citrus panna cotta, as the chocolate mousse was not available.  This smooth and creamy dessert was topped with lemon curd and finished with thin wisps of lemon rind.  Halcyon is on the pricier side, but it's worth the splurge!",

    "text": "Excellent, excellent meal this evening on my first day back in Charlotte since 6 years ago!  After reading the rave reviews and seeing the most amazing spread of appetizers and entrees on the dinner menu, I gathered a couple of my colleagues and went down the street.  I would make a reservation, as this place can get packed even on the weekdays.  If there is a wait, you can wait by the bar that has ample space.  This is a nice place to take a date, but is well-suited for group dinners as well.  The atmosphere is comfortable and kind of has a woodsy feeling.  The lighting is perfect - not too bright and not too dim.  Note that their online menu may not reflect the menu they have for the week, which changes.  Also, they may run out of dishes as the night goes on, i.e, shrimp and octopus.  To start, we got the ceviche, which was perfectly marinated in a tangy lime sauce.  The scallops and yellowtail they used was fresh.  I don't recall seeing any shrimp in it, though.  Comes with a delicate shallot cracker.  For my entree, I ordered the rabbit.  The rabbit was some of the best I've had.  Tasted like it was slightly smoked.  It was well seasoned and soft and cooked to the right temperature.  I've never had rabbit so substantial before - it was so much meat!  Dessert was a highlight.  They were out of the pecan pie and the caramel tart, but to our surprise, their other desserts were just as amazing.  The homemade cinnamon honey ice cream was absolutely delicious.  It wasn't too much cinnamon and tasted a bit like horchata - SO GOOD.  The panna cotta was some of the best I've ever had - not too heavy at all and melts in your mouth. Since they ran out of so many things, they doubled up the chocolate duo dessert for us.  The multi-layered espresso cake reminded me a bit of tiramisu and had a wonderful chocolate ganache on top.  The chocolate semifreddo had a delicious crust and the semifreddo itself melted in your mouth.  I will absolutely return to Halcyon to try the stuff that we weren't able to try this evening.  Also, excellent, friendly service.",

The interior is tastefully decorated with live edge thick wooden tables and a visible kitchen. Halycon uses a farm to table approach resulting in ingredients which are fresh and flavorful. Sauces are excellent, meats cooked to perfection, and a very interesting cocktail and appetizer menu (unique!). Halcyon is a bit on the pricey side and service is slow with an abundance of youthful apparently inexperienced waitstaff. But, the chefs are hitting the mark and the location and accompanying views cannot be beat if you're enjoying a day at Mint Uptown, Gantt Center, or Bechler. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're visiting Charlotte. Try the pork belly sandwich complete with fried green tomato and pimento cheese - so, so good!",

Don't ask why we tried it; it reminded me of when you tried to make chocolate milk as a kid and all of the powder floated to the top in bubbles. Gross!). The Figgadboudit, Rose Thyme and Don't go Bacon My Heart were great drinks but I make dinners better at home. Servers were great and service was wonderful!",

    "text": "Ahh lunch at Halcyon. What a great way to spend your afternoon, uhh, lunch hour (or 2). If it had never ended, I'd be OK with that.   The atmosphere is beautiful. It's like Heidi meets West Elm. Let me work on that visual for you. Farmhouse chic balanced with modern undertones. Lovely.   We began with the Nested Wedge. A roasted wedge of romaine lettuce, gorgonzola fondue, polenta croutons, and thin crispy \"bacon chip.\" I am on a grilled salad kick right now, and this was great. The polenta croutons are melt in your mouth good. A large portion, easily shared.   The duck confit crepe was my entree (naturally). Initially I was served the wrong crepe (which I have to say I was a little sad to send back-it was that good), but I made the correct choice. Nice crispy warm crepe filled with duck confit (of a pork bbq consistency) drizzled with a sweet, honey-like sauce, not at all overpowering. Duck confit crepe. Get it.   I sampled the pate plate. I am slowly being converted into a fan of this \"ultimate culinary delight\". Wow is all I can say.   I also tasted the Trout BLT. It was the only dish to slightly miss the mark. It needed salt, amongst other things.   To make sure we wouldn't starve to death, we finished off our meal with the donut sampler with a chocolate pot de creme. I can't remember the exact name of this dessert. The pot de creme was one of, if not THE best pot de creme I have eaten. MILK chocolate is my favorite. The donuts I could have lived without. They were more like churros, but cold, and cut into 1/8ths.   Halcyon-I will return to you. Preferably when I have nothing to answer to afterwards but a nap.   Wonderful!",

The gnocchi wasn't a potato base & was supposed to be \"lighter\"; the flavor wasn't unpleasant but in your mouth it felt like paste spreading on your tongue - again, I'm not usually a texture person - but it was weird.  Also if it's not gnocchi - don't call it that.  The scallops on top of it were divine but there were only two.  The chicken and the dumplings were ok but the dumplings were the tiniest I've ever seen.  The bread pudding tasted fine, but was dry especially into the center which it's usually the opposite.  $125 for an ok meal means we won't be back for dinner, but we tried it.",

The answer was, \"No, we'll find somewhere for you.\" Since I could only imagine that this meant standing in a corner, I declined.  After hearing wonderful things from others, I attempted a second time, and sucessfully made reservations.  They called the day of our reservations to confirm, and then cautioned me to be mindful of the time, because I would only have an hour and a half.  At this point, I should have known better, cancelled the dinner, and gone elsewhere...but, I didn't...I know, clearly my fault!  The restaurant is beautiful, the view is nice, decorations very homey and sophsicated at the same time.  We ordered the stuffed quail and pate for appetizers.   The stuffed quail was wonderful, one of the best things I've eaten anywhere...and is the primary reason for 2 stars!  The pate baffled me...why serve 3 icecream scoop sized lumps of pate with three tiny toast points is just beyond me. A plate really should make sense...and asking for extra is unnecessary.   For entrees we had the cold pressed duck and the lamb chops.  The duck was nicely medium rare, but I usually enjoy a crispy duck skin and this was soggy and bland.  The lamb was barely edible. The chef recommends medium rare, so this is how I ordered it. It came more than well done. When asked, I did show the waiter (and later the manager) the meat, they saw it was obviously over done. Of course they apologized and offered to re-fire...it was then that I told them of our 1 1/2 hour time limit, and I didn't want to get kicked off of the table!!!   More apologies, they were very sorry...the manager said she had no idea how the time limit thing happened...but would definitely address the situation.  Dessert was ordered, coffee and donuts. This was a little cup of coffee pudding and 3 beignets...Again, I'm puzzled why a dessert ordered for 2 people had 3 beignets, instead of 2, or 4, which would have made much more sense. But, they were delicious.  The price was above average for Charlotte, and most meals and restaurants in this price range do a much better job.  Overall, the quail was spectacular, other things mediocre, and the lamb just awful. We will probably not visit Halcyon again.",

Well-designed, minimal but not too minimal, comfortable space. Educated, trained and relaxed staff. Excellent menu with locally sourced ingredients.  Last time I stopped by was mid-afternoon after I gave a tour at the adjacent Mint Museum.   Had some time to kill and thought, mmmmm, what a nice afternoon to sit on the patio and slurp on some lovely Rose and nosh on some cheese.  The best thing about that afternoon drop in was the server completely 'read' me correctly.  Provided great service, answered in detail my questions about the cheese offerings, ( Ummm, I'm REALLY into cheese),  and then let me sit and soak in some rays while enjoying myself.

Located on the second floor of the new Mint Museum, the place has a nice two-story ambiance with large chandeliers and unique tables and place settings.  The menu options, though minimal, looked tasty. I started out with the pate, which came with 2 small toasted rounds. Good flavor, but wanted more. For my main I went with the roasted chicken which came with spaghetti squash. The flavors were good, but the portion, again, was small. For dessert I tried both the creme brulee and the bread pudding...both, eh.  All in all, not bad, but I left wanting more and hungry. The restaurant week portions seemed smaller than the normal portions as I had food envy with other dishes being passed around. I get that they're small plates, just expected more.",

I started my meal with a Carolina Caipiroska, which was a combination of muddled fresh berries. sugar, lemon juice and Absolut Citron. It was flavorful and perfect for enjoying on the patio! Next we got the cheese plate, which was quite tasty and featured a nice variety of cheeses.   We got a bottle of Hollywood & Vine Cab to go with our meal, which was great. I definitely found a new favorite in this wine. The bf got the filet mignon, which was good, but at 40+ dollars it was extremely overcooked and, he felt, a bit small. My duck and the accompanying fois gras pierogi was also overcooked, and just okay. The flavors combined nicely but I didn't love the dish. In all, the meal was good, but not great.   I'd go again, though, perhaps just for drinks, appetizers & dessert. Yay tokaji aszu on the dessert wine menu!",

The decor is so modern with a rustic feel.  The large table near the bar is absolutely stunning.  I took a group of about 30 people to Halcyon for lunch and could not have been more pleased. The service was impeccable and the food came out hot and very quickly.  The wait staff was so personable and professional.  It was the perfect way to begin our afternoon at the Mint Uptown.   Everyone in my group was more than pleased with their Halcyon experience.",

I enjoy the food, atmosphere and service on each visit.  The most recent trip featured some shared plates - zucchini pancakes with Tatziki sauce and meat and cheese boards.  Delish!  I chose a soup and a couple small plates as my entree.  The soup was a chilled tomato version with basil and olive oil and the small plates were shrimp toast and fried chicken liver lettuce wraps.  In terms of the shrimp toast, don't think Chinese take out version which is a guilty pleasure for me.  These were more like crostini with good shrimp salad on top.  These were good but the chicken livers were outstanding.  Think perfect mix of salt, fat, acid, heat (hmmmm... I've heard that somewhere before} and textures.  Service at Halcyon has always been on point and this trip was no different.  Thanks for an always good experience Halcyon team!",

This is a farm to table concept, from the menus to the tables. No seriously, the centerpiece of the dining room was once a downed tree from the area. The menus can change weekly.  We ventured here for Charlotte Restaurant Week. As an added bonus, Halcyon did 20% off all wine bottles during CRW. Nice touch. For my meal, I went with the Beef Tartare, Crispy NC Catfish, and Chocolate Hazelnut Pie. All were delicious. A friend got the shrimp and sausage stew which I thought was also great. I really want to come back here to try their burger, I am always seeing people raving about it in reviews.  Check them out for brunch, lunch, or dinner. Note: they are closed on Mondays.",

The service was also amazing.   My rating of 3/5 is purely based on the food in relation to the pricing. I had high expectations for the food because lunch prices range from $15-20 per entree, with the exception of the salads which are about $25 if you include a protein.   There were 10 of us in total, and we all walked away with an \"OK\" feeling about our food. The medium rare burger had no pink/was a tad dry, chicken tartine was flavorful, but would have preferred it not be served open face, and the seafood bouillon was not very robust in flavor and did not have enough actual seafood in it. I would recommend the blackened shrimp wrap, as those who ordered really enjoyed it.   Overall, I'm not sure I would be back solely due to not having an overwhelming sense of food satisfaction.",

The restaurant itself has a nice big city ambiance with high ceilings and an open kitchen - akin to something in a business area of NYC or Philadelphia. The restaurant is connected to the lobby of the Mint Museum, which makes this a great dinner option on a Wednesday night when the museum is free for visitors!  Their concept seems to be blending earthy flavors and less common meats together for more unique flavors and dishes. We started with the octopus and bison plates and both were delicious and perfect uses of two meats that are harder to come by in Charlotte. We shared a number of plates for main courses, including lamb and duck.   The service was great and the warm bread had us filling up on multiple rounds because of how good it was! The patio overlooking the street would make for a great people-watching spot in the spring or fall.",

It has beautiful decor with floor to ceiling windows that create such a crips, natural environment. The staff is very friendly and the food just tastes absolutely fresh and healthy -- they also have some great flavors in their dishes!  Their menu covers a lot of bases to satisfy different moods -- a great amount of small plates and salads to choose from, and then entrees have a few different meat options (beef, rabbit, even duck), a handful of fish, etc. You can come here for brunch, lunch, and dinner. They use seasonal ingredients in their dishes. If you go to their website, you can actually view and learn about the local farmers and artist and they source their ingredients for their local dishes from.  Their bread is awesome -- fluffy but a nice soft crunch on the outside. The small plates are a great way to order a few different things. I've loved their charcuterie boards to start and a seasonal small plate of Scallops & Pork Belly is at the top of my favorite dishes here.  The seasonal salads and burgers here are really great for lunch. My favorite item on the lunch menu: their fries. They're oh so crispy and finger licking good with their special seasoning! I promise you will not be disappointed!  Entrees also change with the season but I love what they do with their duck entrees. And if you're sharing, they'll split the dish amongst two plates with no additional charge.  You can't skip dessert, of course. They make a killer goat cheese cheesecake that is super creamy but very light!",

Situated at the top of the stairs to the Mint Museum, this modern restaurant has great views and a nice patio for outdoor seating when the weather is appropriate.  I was quickly greeted and ushered to a table. The service throughout the entire experience was  quick, friendly, and my server was very knowledgable of the menu and easily able to give specific recommendations.   The restaurant itself was clean, modern in design, and had a bathroom that was in good shape. The kitchen area is semi open which adds a nice touch/experience.   The food itself is excellent and fresh. I had a veggie wrap (which was surprisingly flavorful) and fries. I think the best part about the entire thing is that the entire menu was VERY reasonably priced. Usually you hear \"farm to table\" and expect high prices, but my entire lunch was very affordable.   All in all, I highly recommend this place, and if I lived in Charlotte, I'd definitely be a regular!",

We ordered the smoked salmon spread as a starter which I surprisingly enjoyed. I don't typically eat smoked salmon, but this had the texture of a tuna salad and the salmon wasn't overpowering.   For mains we had a variety of salads, a roasted trout and two roasted kale & farro (one with scallops and one with salmon). The salmon was a sizable portion and the scallops were a larger variety (such a buttery texture).   While the prices are a wee bit high, the plates had a lovely presentation and service was kind and prompt. I'll be coming back for more upscale client lunches or special occasions.",

The servers seemed to have knowledge of the items on the menu and were also professional. However, I am disappointed with the management; the wait staff were understaffed which made it tough for the employees to perform at peek efficiency. Overall my experience was excellent and I would definitely recommend this place but, the management of the restaurant needs to schedule their staff more appropriately so it does not reflect badly on their staff.",

When you walk into Halcyon, my first impression was sophisticated elegance, but not in a stuffy, formal kind of way.  The food was A+ all the way - the crispy pig ears, the pork belly app, the pork tenderloin entree, the desserts... everything was delicious.  I could tell the quality of the ingredients was top notch and the preparation was excellent.  The wine list was very thoughtful - one of the few restaurants that seemed to get the connection between wine and food, that if a good dish is paired well, it becomes great.   When I rate restaurants, I look for \"harmony\" which I define as the combination of food, wine, service and atmosphere... for a restaurant to have it, everything needs to come together, whether it is a hole in the wall or fine dining, and nothing is out of synch.  Halcyon has harmony.",

We sat on the outside patio which was very nice great view of city but the table behind us was a little too close because the couple was talking very loudly we heard every word of their conversation clear. We ordered the mushroom tart, Tuscan and kale farro salad, the kona dish and for drinks the unknown IPA and mash-up. The food was excellent but the drinks were terrible had to send the first drink back which was the it's just peachy. They all were watered down and not worth the expensive price. You're going to spend at least $100 plus here for 2 or more ppl. Ambiance was perfect inside for a romantic date night celebrating a birthday. We should have sat inside too avoid the loud couple. They brought dessert out with a candle. We got the mint museum and the chocolate duo both were amazing not too sweet very flavorful. The server was extremely nice, knowledgeable about the entire menu and very helpful. I would definitely good back to eat but will absolutely not order drinks. Would recommend this place. Park in the duke energy garage if you go after 6pm and you'll thank me later. Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",

When my fried quail arrived it was barely warm and not crunchy.  I guess it sat a bit, as the other dishes were being prepared.    I also tried the Tennessee Rib Eye..it was ordered medium rare, but came medium..and it needed more salt.   People that ordered the pork and chicken were licking the bones!  So, I guess it depends on what you order.",

This place has been on my radar for a couple of years as a place I wanted to try but we just finally got around to it. We went with another couple and all 4 of us were equally impressed. How have we not dined here sooner! The space is beautifully modern, yet rustic and inviting, with a great city view out of the huge wall of windows. Every dish was honestly cooked and seasoned to perfection and the desserts prepared in house by their French pastry chef are all exquisite. If you are looking for nice dinner out in the city and enjoy thoughtfully prepared food with attention to detail then you must eat here!!",

A refined urban atmosphere, offering farm-to-table creations that will surprise and delight.  We enjoyed the \"Country Calamari,\" crispy fried pigs ears with a slightly sweet and pleasantly sticky KY bourbon glaze over well-seasoned Kimchi fried rice. The Shishito peppers were nicely flash fried and salted (could have been just  tad crunchier), and the cornbread, served in a little cast iron skillet, was moist, sweet, and just a touch spicy with its Tobasco sorghum glaze. All three appetizers were shared among the four of us, and all were delightful.  The bronzed scallop with crispy kale was perfectly prepared. The Pork 'n greens -- pork belly with brussels sprout petals, bacon and hazelnut-maple mustard -- was perfectly crispy and rich.   Service was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable. All in all, an outstanding evening in the Queen City!",

I got the fresh mozzarella cheese plate as an appetizer which was phenomenal. It really is an \"experience\". Such unique combinations of food that you won't find anywhere else.

It was during the winter restaurant week so maybe that was why I was impressed with the extra effort in the food and the spot on service.  My visit back to Halcyon recently, though, was less pleasant (and still equally expensive). I asked for the chef to whip up something vegan (as they have said in the past they're happy to do); it wasn't impressive: stewed tomatoes, a bland mixed bean  side and some roasted potatoes. The cool part, they were all from a local farm. The not cool part, that simple, small assortment of average cooked vegetables cost me $18.  On top of mediocre super overpriced food, our server was not particularly attentive. It was a slow night but still somehow I ended up rarely getting water refills.  I adore the atmosphere of Halcyon- and how conveniently located it is (I go to The Mint relatively often). I love their wine selection and their intent to try and incorporate local meat/dairy/produce. I just wish the food held up to the standard they claim to have.",

    "text": "Was meeting my aunt for my early birthday lunch (woohoo!). I got a bit turned around because I had no idea it was Pride day, or weekend. So I called the restaurant and asked them for directions. Whomever picked up the phone was very helpful and got me to the location quickly.   We arrived an hour after opening and with the festival going on it was empty. By empty I mean we were the only people in the restaurant, which I think is awesome. What was not so awesome was how the stage was right by the restaurant so I could barely hear God awful pop music throughout our meal. Like everyone else has said, its a beautiful restaurant. The wood tables are stunning, the chandeliers are really neat. It has a very tranquil feeling.   We ordered the snack board and it came out promptly. The black bean hummus was better than I expected, very smooth. The pimento cheese was very flavorful with a bit of spice on the back end but was a bit dry. The dryness was only annoying because it was crumbly and kept rolling off my pita.  Deviled eggs were good, a bit standard but the yolk was creamy and the mustard caviar was a nice touch.   My entree consisted of two South Carolina buckwheat Johnnycakes with a peach bourbon syrup, paired with livermush and a side order of grits. Growing up in the south I know all about livermush but had never consumed it. So I wanted to be proper south. The Johnnycakes were huge and a bit burnt, which I loved. I loved that they did not drown them in the peach bourbon syrup, even though the syrup was great I hate soggy food. I took a stab at the livermush and I did not enjoy it. It was just to weird for me, my aunt said I would either love or hate it. Our waiter was quick to get me some bacon which he coined \"Old reliable\". It was cut thick with a nice smokey flavor. I do have to say the grits were my favorite part of my meal. For me, grits usually suck. They are either to watery or to dry, or taste like Quaker oats instant. These were creamy, rice and had a nice thick texture. I destroyed them.   I left extremely full and on the way out the door my aunt asks \"So when are we coming back?\". I guess you could say we are fans.",

When we arrived we were welcomed by the friendly hosts and seated immediately at a very comfortable table. And gosh, the ambiance of this place!  So many lovely details - the cutlery, the huge windows and all the light they let in, the nest chandeliers, etc etc.  Our server, Kyle, was excellent - so friendly, gracious, and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients.   I had shrimp in dashi broth with kimchi rice grits - butterbeans, brussels sprouts... with dashi and kimchi?!  Ridiculous!  But soooo good!  The wife had eggs benedict with lamb sausage.  We also indulged in tea cakes and a cheese plate, both spectacular.  The makers cocktail with bacon also blew our minds.  Finally, we had the chocolate spongecake with raspberry and chocolate ganache to share - sounds ordinary but it was out of this world!  I am dying to go back to try the grits bowl and the beet and goat cheesecake!    Can't wait to return to this gem.",

The restaurant is right at the entrance to the Mint Museum. It's pretty, upscale, and the waitstaff is capable and professional. But when you serve me food that is burned, not much else will make any difference in my dining experience.  However, I do want to mention that, much to their credit, the worst part of the burned food was hidden from view when the food was plated. The really badly charred parts of the Glazed Heritage Pork Belly and the House-Smoked Pork Meatball were touching the plate ... so hey, out of sight out of mind.  If you're looking for creative cuisine that is burned but served up anyway, look no further. Halcyon will burn your lunch for you.",

    "text": "I was on my way to Good Food at Montford when I got mugged at gunpoint in the parking garage of my hotel. That night, I ate a sad (albeit comped) meal of overcooked steak Diane and chugged several glasses of Sutter Home in my hotel room.  The next night, I was determined to take back my life -- starting with my taste buds. I dined on the earlier side, hoping to avoid crowds and grab a seat without a reservation. Not only did I get a seat, but I was able to saddle up at the chef's bar where I could watch Executive Chef Marc Jacksina prepare my dishes (amazing that in NC, executive chefs are actually working the night chef, touching and cooking food). Given that small dining room, decked out in wood-carved everything from tables and chairs to chandeliers -- I believed that I had taken one of the better seats in the house.   My server was a little frazzled -- perhaps, a little clueless -- as he had a difficult time answering simple questions about several menu and wine items, but he was polite about everything and I wasn't about to pick a fight. I was there to be gastronomically cleansed.   I ordered a California syrah thinking that I'd order myself some pork-liciousness. But I changed course as I watched Chef Marc work. Knowing the pride Halcyon took in sourcing fresh ingredients locally, I decided that I would focus solely on vegetarian dishes -- a huge departure from my largely carnivorous diet. And I didn't want to do the typical -- no wedge salad or cheese plate. I remember a retired Marine who came into my wine store after serving his last tour of duty and upon my asking what he was looking for, replied, \"something memorable.\" In no way do I wish to compare my trials and tribulations with those of our armed service men and women, but I was looking for something akin to the bottle of Les Forts de Latour that I sent him home with.  I opted for a \"beet carpaccio\" and a ricotta gnudi over spaghetti sqaush.  The thinly-sliced beets were sprinkled with sugar and torched -- just enough so the top crusted over like a creme brulee. This was accompanied by a caponota of pureed turnip, shaved apples, carrot puree and spots of aged balsamic. Absolutely delicious -- an epiphany, really -- each ingredient sold itself individually, but blended together harmoniously -- a celebration of seasonal flavors, textures, colors and temperatures.   Then came the warm bowl that contained my gnudi and squash - like a delicate eggs nestled in a fragile bird's nest. With just the right amount of brown, sage butter and dash of nutmeg, this dish put me over the edge. The squash was just right - not a yellow, tasteless mush -- but with just a slight bite the way one would prefer their pasta al dente. The gnudi was fluffy, not heavy -- seared just right so it wasn't greasy, showcasing the skill of a strong kitchen staff.   This meal was incredibly meaningful, coming on the heels of such a terrible experience. I was incredibly appreciative that it didn't disappoint. In fact, it was inspiring to watch Chef Marc and company coax such complexity from simplicity. Quite a triumphant return for my traumatized palate.",

There are walls of windows looking out over uptown Charlotte.  The dining room is small and open.  It's nice, but very casual and earthy.  I love the tables, they are made of what looks like huge thinly cut tree stumps.  That is probably giving you a very weird visual, but it'll make sense once you see them.  You also have the Mint Museum right there and you don't even have to walk outside to go to it.  The cocktail menu is the most unique list you will find anywhere.  You'll see all kinds of original concoctions that are created by the on-staff mixologist who is basically a genius.  For food, there are lots of offerings that you won't find at many restaurants (rabbit sausage anyone?) as well as some Southern classics like shrimp and grits.  The most recent dish I had there was the duck confit.  It was truly outstanding.  Fresh ingredients, tender meat, and loaded with flavor.

    "text": "Food: 5 Ambiance: 5 Food/Price: 5 (brunch and lunch hour) 3 (Dinner)  Pros:  Fresh Ingredients, Expert Execution, Serene Unique Ambiance Cons: Dinner Prices  Halcyon is a restaurant that can do no wrong. A sleek modern terrace abutting the Mint Museum in downtown Charlotte, it seems that nothing on Halcyon's menu is anything less than excellent.   I recently went with a group of nine people during their brunch hour and was able to try a wide variety of what they offer.  Highlights  Pork Belly BLT: An open faced pork belly sandwich topped with crispy bacon, avocado slices, and herb aioli. The pork belly was rich and velvety, the bacon cooked to crunchy perfection, and the marriage of avocado and aioli added a slightly tangy/buttery character to expertly balance out the meat.  Cinnamon Apple French Toast: French toast on steroids...No joke this toast is comically large and fluffy. Our waiter told me it was once normal bread that got angry after being zapped with the gamma radiation machine Halcyon keeps in the back. But this plates transcendence is not solely in the heft and consistency of the bready goodness. The cinnamon and apple blended seamlessly with the butter and syrup to make what I can un-ironically (but totally pretentiously) describe as the platonic ideal of French toast.  Every French toast I've ever had has wished it was this French Toast. If you like shitty music this is the Beyonce of French Toast. If you like shitty TV shows this is the How I Met Your Mother of French Toast. And if you like shitty restaurants this is the Olive Garden of French Toast. If you ever get to Halcyon, do the responsible thing and order the French Toast. I've only eaten three things that I consider to be bucket list meals: Ron's Biscuits and Gravy at Nosh in Durham, The Brisket at Franklin's in Austin, and now the French Toast at Halcyon.  Though I didn't order any for myself I was able to try most of the table's cocktails and can say they were consonant with the quality seen in the dishes, though perhaps even more unique.  And all this without a mention of cool, modern, \"organicy\" feeling decor that somehow makes you feel both avant-garde and cozily local.   The only downside is that once the dinner hour strikes Halcyon's prices jump precipitously, but if you can get there in the morning/afternoon your money will be very well spent.",

Just say you don't know rather than give me a lazy answer.   Venue- Been here more than a few times, great decor and nice outdoor area as well.   Food- The freshly baked bread is a great touch on their cheese plate and other sandwich type of dishes. The croissants were also delicious to start the meal. French toast was really nicely done and served with a berry syrup. Chicken sandwich was just ok, kinda bland.   Drinks- Mimosa and wife's craft cocktail were also solid A-.   So Halcyon,you have a great location, great local ingredients.. Now just learn to enchant your patrons. It is not the same feeling as Kindred, Barrington's, Rooster's, or Gallery where you leave feeling like the whole dinner service flowed seamlessly and that they want you back there again.

Presented three different ways, I was expecting an awesome experience. However, the dish felt a little short of what I was looking for.  The chop was cooked perfectly, medium rare, bu it needed a pinch more of salt, the merguez was good, a little too small, but nicely done and well seasoned, the belly wasn't good, some mire seasoning, a little more charred... Something was missing!  It bring the dish way down.  I would have, probably, done better with my other options.  However, a lit of the of the other guests seemed to really enjoy the roasted scallops!

As is our style, we ordered lots of appetizers/small plates to get a complete feel for the restaurant and what they were doing.  The items involving seafood were the best for me; there was an oyster with a deep sea taste, the scallops were outstanding and the ceviche was nice if not a bit overpriced.  The meat dishes were very uneven, with a braised beef dish being the best because of a wonderful rich sauce but anything with pork belly being uneven at best and the meat board being skimpy, with the piles of mustard being larger than the offered cured meats and sausage.  Two things struck me as either ill-conceived or not acceptable.  There was very little vegetable accompaniment to our dishes and we ordered eight, I believe.  A small leafy salad on one, a couple of mushrooms on another.  Yes, they were appetizers/small plates we ordered but I scanned other tables for entrees and they seemed to be the same.  I would think a \"farm to table\" type restaurant would be brimming with vegetables.  Yes, we didn't order that \"festival\" plate that was all vegetables, but....  The other was, at 8-10 pm on a Friday night, our waitress was clearly intoxicated and it affected her quality of service.  In fact, she seemed to relish taking our drink orders more than our food orders.",

The restaurant environment and decor were pleasing and all of the staff were professional and friendly with excellent service. I was a little surprised to find the kitchen bar empty given such seating is preferred and must be reserved at many restaurants.  The kitchen has interesting and inefficient flow since it was obviously designed to feature a pizza bar with the area since converted to salad and pastry stations. It was nice to observe the pastry station since they are often hidden (I search for kitchen seating while on business travel).   The food was the least impressive part of the evening. My lentil soup was very good but the duck was just average and lacked flavor. I'm not sure if it was the meat quality or lack of a complimentary sauce.  I did not finish the duck but the other plate components were good.   The highlight of the meal was actually the cappuccino and scoop of ice cream. The bartender makes an impressive cappuccino.",

The wine menu is rather extensive but I personally think that the beer seclection is excellent.  Tons of local crafts and all of the other usual domestics and imports.  Can't go wrong.  The atmosphere is what I dig most.  The outdoor patio/balcony seating is the prime spot. Beautiful views of the park and mint museum... Perfect for catching a breeze and people watching!  Best time for arriving.. Right after work because lunch can get a little busy.  But, it's perfect for an after work drink or two or five.  Give it a shot.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

    "text": "What a wonderful restaurant! This is a hidden treasure in uptown Charlotte.   Wonderful atmosphere with incredible food. The staff has always been just wonderful, especially Adam with his sharp wit and spot on conversation.   The pork-based fare is definitely recommended as is the cheese platter.  Don't pass up the Bloody Mary's if you're inclined to alcoholic beverages.  I love the open feeling of the windows and uptown at my fingertips.  The local fare idea is very attractive and the staff uses this to their perfect advantage. Not too over trendy. Just good food, good mood, good location.",

    "text": "Halcyon... when it opened, it quickly became a favorite destination of mine uptown. Lunch or Dinner, the food was always prepared well. Would have easily given 5 stars for food and service.  So what lost the star? The restaurant was priced well for quantity of food when it opened. You came away feeling satisfied paying for a fair portion size. Around mid 2013, the menu has not changed drastically, but the portion sizes are just about halved. I'll elaborate below:  At lunch, getting the salmon used to mean what you would normally think of in terms of a filet. It would be served over potatoes or a puree. With the new menu, you get half a filet, served over carbs, and now you get a romaine heart. Where's the other half of the filet, how did it turn to lettuce?  At dinner, the dessert had a chocolate mousse torte on a hazelnut shell, about 6 inches in diameter. Now it is served in a small 6 oz glass cut with about 5 crushed hazelnuts on the bottom, for the same price.  The Monte Carlo sandwich used to be served with a healthy portion of pulled pork, now there's about two-thirds of the original amount.  The chicken salad sandwich barely has any chicken salad.  Halcyon is still worth going to, just nowhere as frequently.",

Large windows with a beautiful view of the city.  A fountain in the middle of the room.  A long shellacked wood table outfitted with beautiful dishes and silverware.  And twig chandeliers up high. I ordered the baba ganoush.  It was ok, but the real star was the hard cracker type bread served with it.  Was that lavosh?  Before hand, we were brought bread with creamy lemon tinted butter sprinkled with a paprika H.   I also ordered Harvest, an entree featuring root vegetables with a tomato confit.  Perfectly seasoned and displayed in a rectangular plate. Some of our party ordered desserts.  There was an apple dish, creme brulee, and a goat cheesecake, which was the most delicious one. Our server was helpful and personable.  Just part of the wonderful package of great food and a beautiful environment. I told my husband who was not with me that night that he can surprise me anytime for any special occasion by taking me to Halcyon.  Like when I find a dollar in my coat pocket or I slide through ten consecutive green lights. You know, the important things that make life grand.",

I'm not going to lie, that was one of the reasons I joined Mint Museum.   The atmosphere is simply great. It is quaint yet open. The high ceiling and giant glass windows have alot to do with it. It's rustic and romantic, yet modern and simple. You can't beat the surrounding of this restaurant.  I tend to come here for brunch on weekends. For one, it's way easier on the wallet. And I often stop in afterward to the museum and walk around. They are one of the first \"farm to table\" restaurants in town - food is always fresh and well executed, though some dishes are definitely much better than others..   Recent brunch I had a the Chicken Confit with roasted broccoli and polenta. It was more bland, in fact one of the less impressive dishes I ever had here. My friend's braised bison with wild mushrooms were excellent. The single cheese plate came with the tastiest honey. And my friends order the Nutty Cossack cocktail - very yummy if you like coffee, will wake you up quicker than a shot of expresso!  Overall this has to be one of my favorite spots in town - and without any specific reaons besides it makes me happy just by sitting in their dining room.",

Bartender was super friendly and very enthusiastic about his craft which is always a treat.  Thank you, Johnny! I had the French Toast with bananas, walnuts and rum syrup. Oh my friggin god.  Seriously could only eat half because it was so rich, thankfully BF polished it off for me. He had the chicken and biscuits, not my favorite and came out room temperature.  Great decor and really interesting to be able to watch the kitchen work.  48 bucks for 2 drinks and brunch, not horrible since it's uptown and in the museum. We'll be back for sure.",

Inside was like being in some crazy woodland adventure with snow white while on crack.  Outside was more subdued and got great views.  At 3pm they told us the menu was limited and we can only get like 6 things.  My friend got the pork belly and I got the oxtail.  Let's just say, both dishes blew my fucking mind.  ESPECIALLY the pork belly.  Every bite, with the sauce, was phenomenal.  And the dishes aren't large so I was suspicious that we'd still be hungry but we were surprisingly full.  Maybe humans aren't meant to eat full Cheesecake Factory portions after all.",

    "text": "Let me begin by admitting that I got to choose the restaurant, but neglected to do much research to learn that the menu at Halcyon is very bacon - centric. I am one of the 3 people on earth that does not like bacon. My scoring does not reflect any bacon-bias. We walked here from the Blumenthal, but I did see there was parking in a deck pretty close to the restaurant.  The room was beautiful. I sat facing the window and the light of the setting sun on the church across the street was a nice view.  Our server was very personable and committed to the restaurant. That is, he came across as a believer.  Although most of the dishes have heavy influence of pork, there were several that did not and I had a very difficult time choosing.  My friend had the Rockfish entree, and I settled on the beet salad and lentil soup.  The lentil soup was a miss on my part to order. There was nothing wrong with it, but even after I added the spiced yogurt that I did not initially see hiding under the broad brim of the bowl, there was just nothing unique or wow about it. Of course it may intentionally be the one and only thing on the menu to offer \"that person\" in your crowd who is scared to eat anything new.  My beet salad though, would change anyone's mind who thinks all beet salads are the same. First, the presentation is visually stunning (I rarely take pics of my food, had I had my phone though, I would have).  Cubed tender but firm red beet layered between pureed root veggie with orange essence. It also had charred Kale. The crispy kale (tasted like some coarse salt had been lightly applied) created a creamy, crunchy, salt, sweet that was so perfectly complex - I held it in my mouth for an extra second just to pick up everything that was going on there. The portion size was generous (as was the giant bowl of soup).  The Rockfish entree was great, too. Although my friend portioned out a bite for me that did not include bacon, there were still other great flavors going on. I could see how my perception of it needing \"one more thing\" is exactly what the bacon would provide. My friend enjoyed it, albeit I don't know that the portion would have been satisfying to an eater who preferred more. If you're one of those folks who isn't happy unless you feel like a tick after dinner, you should have a first course also.  The wines by the glass are rather pricey and there are very few choices. I had the Zin, and it was more sweet than my preference. The craft cocktails looked intriguing and yes, there is a bacon fat infused Makers Mark drink at the top of the menu.  Considering we each had 1 glass of wine, and ordered 1 salad, 1 soup and 1 entree between us, some might consider this place costly. Considering the quality of the food, the service, and the ambience of the room, I consider it a good value.",

    "text": "We were grateful Halycon was not participating in Restaurant Week and decided to make our second visit.  As others have stated, the decor is very cool with chandeliers made of branches and tables that look like elegant tree trunks.  You can't beat the view of the city at night, and I'm sure the outdoor dining would be great in good weather.  We decided on a pork belly and Brussels sprouts appetizer.  At $10, it was a steal considering the size and flavor.  You can never go wrong with pork belly, and the sprouts were a tangy, vinegary surprise.  Even though we were trying not to get full before dinner, we ate the whole thing.    Since you can also never have too much pork belly, my fella got the burger for dinner.  We thought there was no way the burger could live up to the hype... but we were so glad to be wrong!  The bun was sweet - almost donut-esque - and the pork belly/beef were just the right balance of salt.  The bacon marmalade was smoky and creamy, and the cheese made the entire dish.  It almost doesn't seem right to call this just a burger, so I'm gonna call it a work of culinary art.    I got the fire-roasted chicken, which was fall off the bone tender, and the greens, sweet potatoes and farro balanced it out nicely.  I ate all of it plus a bite of the burger.  Oh, and some of the fries with homemade (cinnamon-y?) sweet ketchup.  Nom nom nom.  Needless to say, we were too full for dessert!  I should note that our server was very fun and personable.  He made a couple of mistakes (forgot a beer we ordered, messed up the check), but he was so apologetic and nice that it was easily overlooked.  I can't recommend Halycon enough!",

As a vegetarian, it was such a delight to have options on the menu other than salad. I got the harvest which is a grilled vegetable dish with a wide variety of vegetables. It was great!! My boyfriend got the rabbit saddle, which he also said was good.  I have to give Halcyon a lot of credit. I arrived in a bad mood because we are new to Charlotte and couldn't find the entrance to the restaurant. We took some wrong elevators and terrible directions from a clerk at the bottom floor. We arrived almost half an hour after our scheduled reservation and were soaked, but they didn't bat an eye and checked our coats. Our service was prompt and they turned my mood around quickly.  The best was the cheese board. The portions of cheese were perfect and they didn't give you too much bread with the cheese. The bread was enough to spread a hearty amount of cheese and also the pairings were delightful. It was hands down my favorite part of the meal.   With a bottle of organic white wine, an appetizer, two entrees and two desserts, we were expecting the bill to be a lot higher. We will definitely be back :)",

Once we walked in, we realized that it was a small but fabulous place for drinks or meals.  The decor was quite relaxing and calm yet not gloomy. That's not easy to pull off. But then again, it's in a building with a museum so they must have some artistic taste, right? For some reason the interior resembled an ancient building in a forest but still looked modern. Of course, I must mention the glass walls. We were sat right by the glass near the center so the view of the city was fantastic. St. Peters church being right in front made it even better.  The champagne and the drinks along with some side were all good. I think I ordered a beer but I don't remember what. I do remember that the lady who waited on us was so friendly and took her time to introduce several other restaurants that we might enjoy. She even talked about her entourage and friends who work at the other restaurants. I think we enjoyed this place better than the actual museum to be honest. In any case, I definitely recommend it.",

There's a patio out front with large tables so you won't feel crammed.  The view from the window is a great one of South Tryon Street.    I was greeted immediately and seated at the window.  My server was there almost immediately and started me out with an unsweetened iced tea with mint.  She also explained the menu to me a bit and explained today's soup a watermelon and 3 other ingredient gazpacho.  On a hot day, a cold soup would be quite refreshing so I ordered that and the Monte Carlo sandwich with dressed greens.  The gazpacho was amazing with a bit of spice to it.  It was so refreshing that I could have jumped in if the bowl were larger.    The Monte Carlo was an interesting and very flavorful open-faced sandwich - BBq pork with cheese and a slaw on top.    Service was outstanding and I definitely thought I needed to schedule my dinner group here.",

Beautiful, with amazing carved tables, great bar and an open feel that is very inviting. After being seated on the patio, we were greeted with water as we previewed the wine list, which is very extensive and offers a wide variety at all different price points. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay and started with the hamachi appetizer. The hibachi is thinly sliced, with a hit of sea salt, and served with grapefruit and multiple smears, a wasabi one that was best! In addition to the hamachi, we received complimentary bread with a rosemary butter, yum! For entrees we chose the scallops and roasted chicken. The scallops were served with crab ravioli and a vegetable medley. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the ravioli truly allowed the crab to be enjoyed. The roasted chicken was too die for, one of the best pieces of chicken I have had ever. It was also served with vegetables and some potatoes.  The food was amazing and was service truly did not disappoint. I truly van no wait until my next visit, maybe this weekend :-)!",

    "text": "Something is definitely wrong at Halcyon...It has been getting weaker each consecutive visit. Saturday night might be our last. The place was just plain tired. The vibe was actually depressing, from the music selections to the staff's general malaise. However...the food was the biggest disappointment...We have enjoyed Halcyon many times in the past but tonight the only redeeming dish was the Beet Gnocchi. Pepper app was a complete waste of time and money. Wife had the chicken, which actually had a very rare section inside (made me a bit squeamish after seeing it on her plate) and the $22 burger is just simply a joke! I got suckered on that one as the description  seemed promising. I actually said to my wife \" this better be the best freakin' burger ever for $22 bucks!\" Well I' lost out on that one...Dry, Dry Dry! no seasoning that I could see or taste and the bun was just blah. They need to got take a lesson from The Liberty on how to make a burger! Fries were nothing special, Go to Good Food on Montford for incredible fries! I hope they can fix things..definitely not an inspiring evening.",
