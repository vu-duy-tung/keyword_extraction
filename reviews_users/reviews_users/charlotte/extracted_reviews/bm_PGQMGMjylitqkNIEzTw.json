It was just ok; there were at least six mussels that weren't opened and we didn't chance eating them.   My risotto was so overcooked ... Duck, order medium, served very rare.  Wife's pan roasted grouper had so much olive oil you couldn't taste anything else.    For desert we ordered the Espresso Cheesecake with Hazelnuts and they forgot to put the hazelnuts on (and the small cupcake sized cheesecake served on huge plate was a joke).  I would not return or recomend Vivace.",

Like the interior overall, good space, table and atmosphere options.  We sat upstairs and it was nice, downstairs had some nice large table options too.  Only ambiance flaw is that it is so close to a major road which isn't very nice to look out on during an otherwise good dinner.",

Being a native New Yorker I have set the bar high for Italian food and I have to say this delivered!   I started off with amazing bread and a delicious Cabernet - next I moved on to one of THE BEST Caesar salads Ive ever had (fresh cheese, delicious croutons, creamy homemade dressing) ...next I had my entree where I enjoyed the homemade pasta (it was a smoked chicken and spinach stuffed agnolotti  = fabulous!!!!) ...then we split a few desserts - while not as memorable great none-the-less.  I will definitely go back- give it a shot if you are sick of the same 3 Italian restaurants in Charlotte !",

I frequent Vivace in Raleigh quite often, love the sangria, love the atmosphere, and figured it would be worth it to give the Charlotte restaurant a try. The food was delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful, if not as intimate as Raleigh's.   The service on the other hand? Horrendous. Our waitress barely stopped by throughout the meal, didn't seem to care if we were interested in another round of drinks, and had an attitude that was horrific. I asked to substitute chicken for the scallops in the risotto, as I am not a fan of seafood at all, and was actually told by her that I was \"ruining the dish:\" Vivace is no five star restaurant in Manhattan, and even if it was, I would not expect such a rude comment to ever be made to a patron. Having been a server myself, I was floored she would even make that comment out loud.   The chicken, by the way, was absolutely delicious and the dish was too. Will not be going back though. I can spend my money somewhere else where I won't get abrasive input.",

    "text": "We had the pleasure this week of visiting Vivace during Restaurant Week.  Restaurant Week dining can be hit or miss in some places, as the huge volume of business can show the cracks in one's service planning, but the staff at Vivace are on the ball!  3 courses for $30?  They up the ante to 4 courses--5 if you count the amuse bouche.  Before we even ordered, we were brought little plates of corvina ceviche, which were fresh and bright.  We were seated in the upper dining area near the bar, which is a little less formal than the main floor, and affords a very nice view of Uptown.  I think this place could be a little loud, but being up there helped immensely with making conversation without shouting possible.   Our waitress happily explained the items on the menu we weren't able to translate ourselves (I know now ceci means chickpea in Italian!) and then we were off to the races.  My husband had the watermelon and balsamic appetizer, the flavors of which he said were \"unexpected\" but very good in combination.  I snacked on the aforementioned fried chickpeas which had a very nice spice on them--maybe harissa?  Something Mediterranean, but not your traditional Italian garlic and basil.  Spicy and flavorful, and fun as finger food!  Then came the first course, which at our table meant bruschetta with fresh peaches and basil (mmmmm, toasty!), and sweet corn agnolotti.  Oh, the agnolotti!  Little pillows of thin pasta bursting with a filling of creamy mascarpone and darkly sweet carmelized onions, coated in a sauce of fresh sweet corn and butter.  I will now forever dream of these when I think of good pasta.  They might make it onto my Death Row Meal list.  Outstanding!    Next up, entrees.  I had the fish, a corvina in aqua pazza with fresh tomatoes and cucumbers.  This is a very meaty fish, and the fresh veggies made for a light and satisfying meal.  However, I cast several longing glances at my husband's hanger steak and potato croquette.  Okay, I admit it, I am a bite-stealer.  Protect your food!  That potato thingy was amazing!  Crispy and crunchy on the outside, meltingly fluffy potato mash on the inside.  This kitchen staff knows what it is doing with a steak, too!    Lastly dessert.  Ah, dessert.  For me, tiramisu, for Mr. L, the lemon panna cotta.  Both very satisfying, both creamy, but light years apart in their vision of dessert.  The tiramisu was sweet, creamy and rich, the panna cotta was thick and light, with a little astringency from the blueberries.  In all, a perfect ending that suited both our dessert palates.    Will we go back during a normal dining week?  Oh yes!  There is a charcuterie plate we saw go by that I must try, and I am sure their grilled pizzas are a wonder of bread and cheese engineering, and, well, everything on their menu looks like it is well thought out and carefully constructed.  What a pleasure!",

My Government job has held staff quarterly meetings here based off of my great experiences as well at Vivace's and needless to say that will cease as of today.   I took a friend here and attempted to order a Panini I have eaten several times at this restaurant.  The waitress nastily informed me they do not carry a Panini of this sort.  I remained calm and professional and described the Panini to a T....b/c I know for a fact that I didn't make this up in my dreams.  The waitress therefore explains a Panini on the menu that is similar to what I am describing and ensures that is what i must be referring to it.  Silly me.....I order her suggestion knowing full well that is not what I have eaten several times at this place.    I am also a little disturbed that this waitress is basically calling me a liar regarding the meal i formerly ate vs checking with a manager.     Low and behold a sandwich of disaster is placed on table and once again I question waitress on  this sandwich.      Lol as waitress rudely semi slammed menu on table and gritted through teeth \"MISS WE DO NOT SELL FRIED CHICKEN IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT\". lol lol lol once I informed her panini was like a breaded/fried chicken parm sandwhich.  Did i ask for a pot of chitlins, pig feet  and collard greens???  Well  thankfully I requested a manager who stated that item was no longer on the Menu and apologized for the waitresses behavior.    Needless to say this will be the last time I visit this establishment and next time train your staff to check with upper management before getting nasty and rude with CUSTOMER'S and acting as if they rather be scooping dog poop than taking your order!!!      And sadly the lady manager acted as if she rather just replace my order than taking the time out to hear the nasty/rude treatment my friend and I were receiving since being served by this new waitress.    Learn your companies menu ( or former menu) before getting ready to stand your grand and argue a customer down  . Restaurant 101.....................SMH",

Then we ordered appitizers, which were pricey and good, but not great.  (The mussels were really good though!)    Overall, it could be a great place and I would be willing to try it for dinner, but I was not overly impressed by my \"night at the bar\"...or the really big check we got!

    "text": "We just went to vivace for the first time. Although we were not blown away, we were ultimately satisfied with our meals. The location itself is very easy to get to with plenty of parking and  free valet. The decor is very nice. The dining room is open with a trendy atmosphere. They definitely spent some money with the decor between the lighting, the grand staircase and the wine vault.   One thing we enjoyed was they substitute butter or olive oil with a house made bean spread with their bread. We thought it was a great change. We started with the gnocchi with spinach and pancetta appetizer. I have to say it was a True appetizer because it made us look forward to our meal. It tasted fresh and had great flavor. The only downfall is it blew away both of our entrees. I had the veal saltimbocca with cheese ravioli. The veal was nicely cooked but the sauce lacked any flavor other than mushrooms. The ravioli was house made and was perfectly cooked. However with the somewhat bland sauce and only being cheese filled it did not really add to the flavor of the dish. My wife got the pappardelle bolognese. The pappardelle was house made however it was very overcooked and a bit mooshy. The appetizer would definitely get five stars and the two meals between two and three stars. Eventually I would like to go back and try a few other dishes. I give big points though to the fresh and homemade ingredients though.  We are looking forward to going back soon. Look for a second review!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Vivace, which probably set me up for the large disappointment it turned out to be.  This is my second visit to Vivace; I don't remember much about the first visit, but I didn't think it was bad, so I decided to come here for a graduation celebration this past weekend. Boy, was that a mistake! The service was appalling and the food was lackluster.  I had a reservation for 9:30p on a Saturday. Two members from my party of seven arrived on time, and the rest arrived about 5-10 minutes later. After about ten minutes, our waiter, Jeffrey, came over to fill (and refill) our glasses and take our orders. Now, I realize Vivace isn't like other restaurants, but it would have been nice if they would have laid out some bread or something while we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive. That's right. Forty-five. Minutes. What the deuce. We even contemplated leaving and just going to Wendy's down the road. I understand it was a Saturday night and we had a party of 7, but by golly it was not that crowded in there! And to add insult to hunger, our (not so) lovely waiter Jeffrey (and one other person) stopped by two, maybe three times the whooole night to refill our water glasses. Once we got our food, Jeffrey didn't even stop by again to ask how it was or see if we needed anything. So since Jeffrey failed to perform his due diligence, I'll tell him through Yelp...  The food was average at best. I ordered two appetizers for my meal (again, took 45 minutes to arrive), calamari and mussels. They were alright. Nothing remarkable about them.  My parents ordered the Grilled Salmon ($21). When it arrived at our table, the first question every one asked was, \"Where's the rest of it?\" Those little itty bitty pieces of salmon were at most 3oz! A little piece of salmon rested on a just-as-small bed of undercooked beans. My mom was pretty irate about it, so I told her to ask for something else, but I'm sure you all know about the possible tale of angry cooks/waiters. And on top of that, it probably would have taken another 30 minutes to arrive... My dad noted that that was one of the few times he arrived at a restaurant hungry and left just as hungry.  The veal was \"okay.\"  Only one member of our group of seven was satisfied with their meal. One. He ordered the lamb, if you're curious.  Throughout the night, I noticed a couple that sat at the table next to us. They arrived after us and received their cocktails and meals before we did. I believe Jeffrey was also their waiter since he was at their table more than he was at ours.  After we were done eating, it took another 20-25 minutes for Jeffrey to stop by our table again, and I had to hail Jeffrey over after he hastily handed out the dessert menus so that I could ask for our check.  All together, we spent almost $200 for that miserable dinner, which we waited an unreasonable amount of time for. It was a waste of money! There was a mandatory 20% gratuity on our bill because we had over five individuals at our table (even though we were on two separate bills). 20% is ridiculous for terrible service.  I felt terrible that I brought my family, who came here from out of state and curious about Charlotte, to Vivace only to be disappointed with their overpriced, average, and untimely meal.  On a positive note, the restaurant has great interior design. But on another negative, it is sooo loud in there. Yeesh.  Vivace, you do not have to worry about me returning here again. I would not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Brand new to CLT and became acquainted with Vivace at the CLT Bloody Mary Festival.  The only restaurant to talk to us about their restaurant and invite us to come and check it out was Vivace.... Blythe and Trip!  Blythe is perfect person to have as an ambassadors for the brand!  We ended up going to the restaurant only because of them....how surprised were we when we showed up and Blythe was there! She personally came out and welcomed us (again) and told us about the menu selections, weekend brunch and introduced us to Chello.... WOW! The ambience of the restaurant is like stepping back in time with big band elegance and decor and personal attentive service unlike what you see today.  A hidden gem..... staff that is genuine and only wants you to have an exceptional culinary experience. Can't wait to go back and try the weekend brunch!  Huge shoutouts to our beautiful Romania server Dana and bartender Alex (also new to CLT)- we'll see you soon!   Thank you Vivace for the warm welcome - we look forward to making CLT home and becoming regulars! Cheers!",

We were visiting with another couple and hadn't looked at the menu at all so Caleb, being such a gentleman and patient waiter that he is, said he would again give us more time and never rushed us. Finally we just gave up and asked Caleb to pick an appetizer for us. He described several and brought us a mushroom flatbread which was delicious. We also had bread and lobster bisque and a chicken dish with rosemary potatoes. All were delicious as were the drinks. Caleb was a perfect gentleman, a perfect waiter and very handsome too!!",

When I go to a restaurant, I am there for the experience. The experience was not less than perfect, it was mediocre. As long as Vivace strives for mediocrity, then it has no problem. But something tells me that the owner aims for more than that. As parents of a small child, my wife and I only have an opportunity to go out on weekends. We were really looking forward to visiting this place. Unfortunately, all it takes is a crappy waiter named Everett to spoil the experience.  My advice: Have staff read Setting the Table by Danny Meyer. If they don't get it, let them go pursue careers in a field that appreciates sardonic huffing and puffing.  I wish I could write two bad reviews for this place but unfortunately I cannot do so. But, I will make sure to recommend this place to people that I really do not like. Save your money and go to Little Spoon just 5 minutes away. Their food is absolutely awesome and the service is so stellar it should be used as a benchmark for other restaurants in the area.",

Very nicely decorated and loved the open kitchen along with the light fixtures. We both didn't think the bread served was the best, as it was seasoned and served cold. However the rest of the meal was top notch.  Hubby went with the creamy tomato with goat cheese. It was excellent and natural flavor with a snippet of goat cheese that went perfectly together. We chose vivace meatball appetizer and the sauce was perfect. For an entree hubby went with scallop risotto that had a perfect sear and prosciutto that was flavorful and well balanced with snap peas.  As I dove with delight into the special - duck lasagna bolognese with house made cheese and layered veggies- it was without a doubt the best lasagne I have had in my life.  The best part is it will be added to the regular menu! Both of us too full for dessert- we left well fed and happy and the prices weren't out of line either. Having a nice deal to use helped - but without that I still think the meal was top notch, excellent service and reasonable for a High end Dining experience. Nice valet parking as well. Worth the visit!",

I had received two mimosas within our entire time being there. By the end I was seriously just looking for my server to close out. Not worth paying the extra price for unlimited if your drink sits empty for half an hour. I get being busy but to be blatantly ignored was not ok.

    "text": "I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.  BUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!  We arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen.   The chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite.   After looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.  For my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)  At this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time.   You're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.  Needless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back.",

Normally I like my Italian food in the hole-in-the-wall place with the red and white checkered table covering and the home-cooked style that tastes like Grandma is cooking in the back.  So when I think about fine dining, my mind normally doesn't go to Italian (unless I'm in NYC), but Vivace does a great job.  Only reason I dinged them a star is that the Raleigh location seems to have better quality food... not sure if its a talent or food supply issue, but I think consistency is important for a 5-star and CLT has a bit of catch-up to do with Raleigh.  On a final note, it is refreshing to see an Italian restaurant stick with an all-Italian wine list!  There's a reason why Italian cuisine goes so well with Italian food - it is not a coincidence.  So to not see the \"Harris Teeter\" collection of wines here was great and the bottle selections are awesome... coming from a guy who is obsessed with Italian wines.",

Go here and you will be treated the way I wish EVERY restaurant in the world treated their customers-friendly and respectful staff, no snobbery either.   2. The food. Here are just a few of my favorites:   Mussels: If you are a mussel fan, get these. A large portion of mussels (none of this 10 dinky mussels in a dinky cereal bowl type of thing). The broth is excellent. Want extra bread for dipping (recommended)...no problem!   Cured Meat and Cheese board: You can select a variety of cheeses and meats for a yummy appetizer. The staff has never steered me wrong when asking for a recommendation.   Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Cake: I have come to Vivace solely for this dessert (after eating dinner elsewhere!). Be difficult like me, and ask for plain vanilla gelato, if they have it, in purist fashion.   I have tried a variety of their entrees, the salmon and duck particularly stand out. Oh- and their brunch options are delish, and will cure even the sickliest of hangovers, with class of course. Portions are very nicely sized. The atmosphere is lively, modern, but still relaxed and un-stuffy. Please go to Vivace, it will not be your last visit.",

Pair it with a glass of \"Gertrude\" red blend (Cab, Merlot, Sangiovese) 3. The Hanger Steak with the braised short rib and Yukon potatoes is awesome so order that. 4.  The Pasta's are made in-house and you can taste the difference, have someone else order a pasta dish and steal a bite.",

If you have a gluten alergy, here is a place that caters just to that and meatless options, an entire menu, how considerate! The service is always on point and they have the food to back it up.",

We were seated on the second level which was nice but seemed a bit less cozy than the first level with a view of the bar and a tv playing college basketball. We started with a bottle of Chardonnay and then both ordered from the restaurant week menu. I'll first say that the service was excellent, our waiter Sam was attentive even when he had a large party seated in the section, and answered all our questions while providing helpful recommendations. I started with the octopus, which was tender and perfectly cooked, served over fingerling potatoes with two sauces. This was a hearty and large appetizer. The pumpkin gnocchi for my entree was delicious, really complex flavors and lots of texture to complete pillowy gnocchi. The tiramisu was good but nothing unique. My fiance had the caprese salad and veal saltambuca, he wasn't a huge fan of either but good tomatoes can't be expected in January. The veal and sauce was one note with a mostly salty flavor, the ravioli accompanying the dish were a bit thin and lacking in filling. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Maybe I just ordered better but we are curious to come back and try brunch and the bar bites menu. This is a lovely place for a date night or Special event.",

You'll find a great atmosphere and delicious menu. Perfect for a date night, group dinner, or drinks and appetizers at the upstairs bar after work overlooking the Charlotte skyline.  For dinner I enjoyed the scallop risotto--amazing!  And my friend was generous enough to let me taste the mussels--also incredible!  Trust me that you will clean your plate, but don't deny yourself dessert.  They are amazing!  We ordered several desserts for the table to get a taste of each and in my opinion the best were the gelatos.  They change their flavors but we had cinnamon, mint chocolate chip and nutella--so good!  I'd say Vivace is the best Italian in Charlotte.",

The decor is modern and crisp and the staff greet you right away - a mere hint to the type of food experience that awaits.   Unlike everywhere else I have have had Italian food in Charlotte, you can order even the heaviest of items from the menu and you will find that they have somehow been transformed into lighter crisper/fresher dishes. The flavors may become more delicate and modern as a result of Vivace' take on Italian cuisine but you should know that nothing is lost in translation.   I have been to Vivace multiple times and I have always had a great experience all around. The service is snappy and the food is good.",

The pizza is a little bit more affordable and would be great enjoyed in their outdoor spaces on a nice afternoon.    The space is my favorite part.  Lots of nice things to look at - modern wood paneling, big orange chandeliers, high ceilings and more.  The outdoor spaces are pretty lux and streamlined as well.  The food was good.  I got a chance to try the calamari, which was served in a large portion with sauteed red pepper slices and the gnocchi with shrimp (rich and delicious!).  The melon and prosciutto salad was excellent.  For entree I got the chili capellini and lump crab.  It was a little spicy and was good, but I wasn't amazed and thought it was outshined by the gnocchi I started with.  I preferred my friend's sweet corn and potato agnolotti with smoked chicken.  I thought it was interesting that they stuffed the pasta with the sweet corn.  Service was pretty good.  Our waitress was helpful and friendly and great at keeping our drinks refilled.  The entrees took a while to come out, which was strange since the place wasn't that crowded.",

My friend and I ate on the patio downstairs which overlooks the walking path, so perfect for a lazy Sunday experience.   Two tiny bads upfront: the Sangria; they only have red and it was pretty watered-down boring with only bar fruit. Weird. We switched to the house Merlot shortly thereafter which was fine. The service was sloooowwww which was odd since it was not very crowded. Tolerable, but slow.   The entrees, fantastic. They are about $23-$24 a piece. I had the duck, medium. It was unreal!!!! Delicious sauce and fantastic presentation. (Yes you must laugh with your date at this point recalling Christmas Story and no the duck does not come out with its head still on!!) :-D It was tender and sweet....perfection and well worth the wait. The risotto accompaniment was salty and not overdone - LOVED it!!   My friend got the crab-stuffed trout which he devoured. He totally got the Clean Plate Award and wouldn't let me try any of it! A sign that he was in love also (at least with the trout lol).   They will let you make reservations here for the patio if you have something coming up and want to be sure to be seated outside. A lot of restaurants won't guarantee patio, they will do a 'first come first served' basis for patio seating - blah..I don't like that (ahem Bricktops!!!) And when you make reservations you will get in their system...where they also log any allergies or special requests with your information - very nice!!! Love you Vivace!!! Cant wait to be back! :-D",

    "text": "Singlehandedly the worst dining experience ever. We were quoted a 30 minute wait for a party of 6, by a manager. We saw some people come in after us and got sat faster, even another party of 6. About 45 minutes into the wait I approached the host stand and asked much longer it was going to be. The hostess told us we had only been waiting for 15 minutes and then said she couldn't tell us how much longer, I asked to speak with someone who could tell us. The same manager who quoted us 30 minutes apologized and told is we would get some appetizers and drinks for free. At this point, we understood mistakes happen. We were sat, and didn't get greeted for about 10 minutes by our server Josh. I asked Josh if he could find out about their vegan options. He told me a chef or manager will come over to go over what I could eat. We were almost finished with the appetizers and still no manager or chef. Josh was very apologetic and told me I could pretty much get a few sides or a salad. We ordered our food and about 30 minutes into us waiting, a manager alerted me what I ordered wasn't vegan. At this point I was so over it I just told her whatever they could throw on a plate that was vegan was acceptable. We were told it was taking so long because they had a few private events that were in front of us. 45 minutes later we finally got our food, at least 15 minutes after Vivace closed. The management team just seemed concerned that we left, they offered us discounts, which we accepted, but wouldn't even stick around to litsen to what we had to say. The only reason that I am even giving this 2 stars is because Josh really did what he could for us to have a good night. This was a huge disappointment, and I would never come back.",

Make reservations if you can. Arrive on the earlier side of brunch to get a table outside and to avoid the inevitable lines and waits (worth every second though).   If you're looking for traditional eggs and potatoes, this isn't for you. Their menu (is fantastic) is Italian so the dishes are heavier and hearty. I always get the brussel sprouts and potatoes for my antipasta (mmmm) and the shrimp and grits for my entree. Both are so good and I always leave with a to go box.

He kept track every time my mind changed (often) and made sure that every detail was not missed. He was super communicative / got back to me right away with any and every question. His team that night made every single moment perfect from set up to breaking everything down and every little detail in between. The food--oh the food-- I have had emails from over 50 people already who won't stop raving about how this was the \"best food they've ever had at a wedding.\" Food was the #1 thing for my husband and I and they surpassed all expectations. Hot, on time, incredible. Cocktails and the bartenders were the BEST ever as well. All of the wait staff were friendly, super helpful to me (making me a plate to be sure I ate... taking our photos when my photographer didn't show...) truly made the night perfect.

When you first arrived they have free valet parking which is always nice (especially in the heat of the summer). When you walk into the restaurant it has a large floor plan with two different levels and two different outside patios. We were seated upstairs which was a nice smaller area with its own private bar.  Overall I was very impressed with the layout in the design of the restaurant.   The food, all the food that I happen to order was pretty good overall. I wasn't blown away by anything though. I'm not going to hold that against the restaurant because all the other people I was with thoroughly enjoyed their meal. And it may have just been my failure to order what my taste buds were craving.  The waitstaff was very organized and professional, when there was an issue they took care of it right away and apologized.   In the end, my overall experience at the restaurant is worthy of five stars. they did a great job and the food was very good I would recommend it and return.",

TABLE We were first seated at the booth that is right in front of the kitchen diagonally from the hallway to the bathrooms. The minute we sat in the booth it had that super strong disgusting smell. She thought it smelled like vomit. So we moved tables to the long banquette. I am 5 foot 8 and the table came up to my chest so I felt like a midget sitting at this table. I don't know if the bench seating lost its spring or what. We told the server that we moved because it smelled bad at the other table. The server said that customers often throw up from the bottomless mimosas at brunch. Great. Not.   FOOD I got the calamari appetizer and it was 90% tentacles and 10% rings. The red sauce it came with was gross- there is no other word for it. I left the majority of the appetizer on the plate. I got the beef tenderloin for the entree. The beef was good and quality was good, but it was a small portion. The giant bed of risotto it sat on was gross- no other word for it. Just a terrible taste. It came with carrots for the vegetable. I didn't touch them. Again, I left everything but the beef on my plate. Now for dessert; this is where it gets interesting. I got the ice cream; I think it was some kind of mint flavor. When it came, it was melted on the sides and there was a blown out candle stuck it. We didn't tell the server that we celebrating a birthday so I have no idea why it came to me this way. MAYBE VIVACE CAN EXPLAIN THAT ONE beause I have no effing clue why I would be served someone else's dessert. Then the server was hung up at another table and we had to ask another server for our bill.    I left with the feeling that this is a place that serves food for money. How are they allowed to do this? Will not be going back. EVER.",

    "text": "I dined at vivace two days ago. I had a large party of 14 for a surprise birthday brunch for my boyfriend. One of my guests reviewed the restaurant on Facebook and described a mishap they had with seating before we arrived. I have included vivace's response to his review as well as my own person experience....    (unbelievable at how the restaurant responded to a poor review. Is this the owner's Facebook? Is this the manager's Facebook?)   \"I was the one that made the reservation with vivace. I was told on the phone that unless this was a surprise celebration the entire party must be present to be seated. I gave my credit card info because I was told that for every guest that didn't show up, I would be charged $10. Okay fine. I wanted to come there. The day before the brunch I contacted vivace to update my head count and changed it to a higher amount. I reiterated on the phone that this was indeed a surprise brunch. I told the hostess my guests would be arriving around 2 and I would be arriving with the birthday boy around 2:20. She said that was fine and we would be accommodated. I did not realize the trouble that my guests went through trying to be seated until after I had arrived. This is quite embarrassing for me since I was the one inviting the guests. Our waitress Heather was so nice and very apologetic for the mishap. She gave us great service and was well compensated. All of the attending guests plus ourselves are in the service industry. As my guests left one by one, four of us remained. The endless mimosas and bloody Mary's ended at 3:45 and by this time it was 4:00. I asked my waitress if we could move to the bar downstairs so she could finish cleaning and end her shift... The manager wearing the football jersey cut her off and rudely input that they were closed and we would have to leave. The waitress apologized for his grouchiness after he walked off. I brushed it off, after all no one died. As we went downstairs and said our goodbyes near the elevators. The bartenders and managers could be seen rolling their eyes at the remaining 5 guests seated in the bar area. Wow. How obvious. Disappointed at the response on my guest's review. How embarrassing. Guess they are doing so good they can afford to lose 14 customers. \"",

The Pinot Grigio wine was fantastic!   I used the complimentary valet so parking was easy. The waiters were awesome! We sat inside but the patio looked great!",

The people honestly felt like they either were lost in space or just flat out didn't like their job.   I didn't even want to get food because I knew it was going to take over an hour. I order a drink and they told they didn't have it and I was just like you should know what you carry and don't carry anymore or update your menus.   Granted that's not as big of a deal as the fact of the TERRIBLE customer service here! Maybe dinner is better but forget about their brunch and go somewhere else like Dandelion as they have the BEST GRITS. Will not be rushing to brunch or a dinner at Vivace any time soon if I'm going to be treated as a second class citizen.",

There was hardly anyone on the main level of the restaurant customers, staff or otherwise.  One gentleman greeted us and asked if we were taken care of and our friends mentioned that another man had acknowledged their arrival and then gone upstairs.  There was music playing on the main floor but then also really loud music of a different type coming from upstairs which was really distracting.  There were only two other tables in the main dining room with guests but several tables were empty with dirty dishes that hadn't been cleared.  About 10 minutes after we arrived we were seated and our waitress seemed less than thrilled about helping us.  I asked her if there were any specials and she gave me a weird look and said, \"everything is special\".  My husband also called her ma'am and she snippily replied that she was no ma'am.  He apologized and called her miss instead.  He was just trying to be polite. She was not attentive, she did not ask how we wanted the bill split, she did not keep us in refills, she was slow with requests.  It was just a very poor experience.  We will probably never go there again.",

At the price of $30, get your endless mimosas or Bloody Mary's, an appetizer and an entree. Yes, alladat! If not getting the package the mimosas are still $4 for a double which is still a great price. Although the brunch menu has changed a bit from my last visit (where is the French toast?!) it is still filled with a mix of Italian and American favorites. While eating their for New Year's Eve, i ordered the short rib over potatoes with poached eggs. It was hearty, filled with succulent short rib in a nice sauce and the eggs were perfectly poached. Although in my opinion the short rib needed a bit more salt and pepper, leaving it as it was is perfect for the many tastebuds that travel through. Overall, this is a great brunch spot for food and drinks with great friends or strangers because the people of Charlotte are always nice and welcoming! Also Alex the waiter upstairs is amazing and so very thorough!",

I got the short rib hash... literally the best has I have ever had! The meat was so tender. Highly suggest getting it (can be included in the $30 deal).

I made the reservation over a week out and first off was told that if my number was off by 3 to 4 people they would charge me $150. This is absurd when I am trying to bring them business. Once we all arrived we were sat at 12:15 we had two servers (which you would think could handle 15) our drinks took about 20 minutes to come out then we sat for another 30 before they asked if we would like to order. We then waited 45 minutes for appetizers to come out and then an additional 45 minutes for our food to come out which they got one persons order wrong and the drinks were not refilled. Not only did one person speak to the manager but two and he just continued to avoid our table. They also normally do something for birthdays and did nothing for mine. At the end it took 20 minutes for checks to come out. Brunch at 12 lasted till almost 3 and there was no discount or compensation. It also ended with the female server telling me sorry I know it was your birthday, but sometimes things don't always happen they way we want them to on our birthday. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of care and service since I thought (past tense) so highly of this place and to be honest am embarrassed I invited guests to join me for a birthday here. Not only did you lose one customer but you lost an additional 15 of all the people that attended. Don't waste your time coming here",

The mahi, tomatoes and potatoes were fine but not spectacular. The brussels sprouts were clumsy, under-seasoned and a bit burnt.  Desert: Hazelnut panna cotta. The panna cotta was light and very enjoyable the hazelnut was imperceptible.   I would go to Fiamma or Moffett's new place Stagioni  instead, given the choice.",

In fact our food came before we got our drinks. I got the frittata and it was more of a block of cheese looking egg jello that was not ok (see pic). The waitress acted like she didn't care and said oh yea...we changed it. Thanks would have been helpful to know the frittata was no longer a frittata. We also ordered the thyme ricotta squash bruschetta and instead received plain toast with olive oil and tomatoes. Confused I asked the server if I could see the menu.  Did I order the wrong thing? I was told that they also changed it last minute and probably should have told me. I am not picky so while I was annoyed I ate it and moved on. Buuuttt then our server was gone.  25min went by and I never saw her. I asked another server if I could get a drink refill and was told I had to ask my server. Needless to say I got it another 10min later with my check.",

Thin slice bread. I've been to Italy many times and never ate bread like this. They put it through a slicing machine, best I can tell.  Pasta course - eh also. Came to the table absolutely cold. Pasta was al dente though.  Main course - right on the money. Very good. Portion size is good and cooked as desired.  Wine and desert and coffee - very good also. Sizable wine selection of Italian wines. Impressive. Espresso served hot and with proper utensil (demitasse spoon).  Service - ok but a bit unprofessional. I like a little more formal approach and a knowledgeable wait staff. But ok. For all that wine, the place should have a wine steward on staff. How else would they be able to recommend all those $200 and up wines correctly? Our waitress was clueless when it came to wine.  3 1/2 stars. Best I can do.",

My meal was not very flavorful and I was unhappy with it. They forgot to bring out my dessert, even after they severed the 3 others at my table. We were not given any silverware and it took at least twenty minutes for the wine we ordered to be brought to our table.

    "text": "Friday night (7/22/2016) was my 3rd time to Vivace. My 1st 2 experiences were great with no complaints, however, this time extremely disappointed me. I want to write off the sub-par food to it being Restaurant Week and it being busy because of the event. I took my husband there because I raved about the food at brunch, and it seems like everything crumbled for him. Our appetizers were delicious (I had the caprese salad and he had the cheese tray). However, our main entrees left a lot to be desired. I had the lobster ravioli which came out barely on the verge of warm, and the raviolis were hard around the edges. My husband ordered the steak with potatoes medium-rare, and it came out to the table cold to the touch, and RED rare. The dish also came with a huge roasted bone for the marrow, which looked like a nasty chewed up dog bone (so un-appetizing). When my husband sent the steak back to be cooked closer to medium-rare, our waitress dropped the bone on the floor, which splattered everywhere, and no-one came to clean it up the entire rest of our visit (other guests and servers were walking through it). When the dish came back, the steak was barely warm and still red. At this point, I had finished my dish, and my husband decided to eat some of his. After a few bites, it just wasn't appetizing to him, and the consistency of the meat was almost like pot roast. Thankfully, our desserts were much better (he had the black and white tiramisu and I had the watermelon sorbet). Overall, the best part of the night was the view we had from upstairs. Brunch is highly recommended from here, but this time around, I wouldn't recommend this place for Restaurant Week dinner.",

We had a lovely table on the 2nd floor looking out over the Charlotte Skyline.  My date had the tomato bisque for a first course and it was like velvet.  I had the Caprese Salad and just.. mmmmm!!!  For our entrees we decided to order two different half orders of the pasta dishes.  (Yeah, they do \"half orders\", can you believe it!?\"  We ordered the special which was braised beef with melted cherry tomatoes, and also the Crab pasta dish (see menu online) which came with pasta made with tomato sauce IN the pasta and a little red chille pepper... a white wine sauce, cherry tomatoes and arugula.  OMG... SO SO good!!!  Both dishes were perfect.  They also serve this super yummy \"white bean spread\" with their bread.  It is such a lovely alternative to butter or oil!  Very unique.    I agree with Chris M., nothing here is heavy at all.  The atmosphere is very trendy yet relaxed and in no way \"pretentious\".  Our waiter was very nice and well-versed with the menu to assist us in making our selections.  This was the first of what I hope will be many, many more visits to this fine establishment!",

They have a wonderful patio with city views that sits right along the Little Sugar Creek Greenway. For these reasons, it's a lovely place to bring out of town family and friends. Brunch is decent but remember you can't get a drink until noon (they open at 11.) Favorite meals are the Tuscan Kale Salad with Salmon, Fried Oysters, Pappardelle and Ribeye. Love their wine list- try the Talamonti red, white or rose by the glass ($8-$9.) When the valet isn't available (usually weekdays) parking can be a pain. Will continue to dine at Vivace as their food is always delicious.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Vivace on a Friday night with two friends to celebrate recent events and we were really looking forward to a lovely evening together. This was our first time to Vivace, but we had heard great things and we were excited that the weather was perfect to sit outside on the patio! It wasn't too busy for a Friday night, though every restaurant around them seemed packed.  Unfortunately, our experience at Vivace was disappointing to say the least. Terrible and slow service were the main issues. We arrived first and sat at the bar to wait for our friends - we were there ~5-7min without being approached or even greeted by one of the two bartenders who seemed flustered. Our friends arrived and we decided to head straight to our table - which was dirty and needed to be cleaned. Our server came by and greeted us to say he'd be back in a minute... Service Disappointments:  1) Drinks - once at the table, we waited over 15min to get our first drink order 2) Appetizers - took ~20min for Calamari, Brussel Sprouts, and Bruschetta 3) Table Prep - when apps arrived, we had no plates or silverware for an additional 5ish min 4) Drinks Round 2 - second round of drinks also took ~15+min for 4 glasses of wine 5) Entrees - when dinner Finally arrived, (we'd already been there for 1:30) the server accidentally spilled our friends dinner all over her lap and shoes, then took ~5min to get her some soda and towels to clean herself up. They offered her dessert for the inconvenience.  6) Food Quality - After ALL that, the food was mediocre at best. Fig pizza was prob the best thing we got all night - and the cheapest.   While we all had a great time catching up, we didn't expect our time at Vivace to span almost three hours for dinner. Our experience was terrible - we will not be back.",

We instantly fell on love with Ashley, our server. She was educated on the features ( I devoured a scrumptious soft shell crab ) Ashley made us fall in love with Vivace. Both she and Hillary gave us superior service beyond compare and also raved about their management and owners. This spoke volumes to both me and my date; as business owners ourselves. We will absolutely return. Tried the Duck Gnocchi.....best in town! We are hooked. If you get an opportunity, see Hillary for unrivalled Italian wines and absolutely see Ashley for royal service!

    "text": "The hubs and I ate at Vivace last night for dinner. Kitchen renovations are ongoing so we continue to cut a swath through the culinary scene of CLT. I had completely forgotten that I had a gift card for this place and it had been quite some time since I'd been there. I do always love the patio, though, and given that this was the first super gorgeous spring day that we've had, it was a no-brainer that we needed to make this happen. Stat.   I made a reservation for 5:30 since we both work uptown and it's easy to get to Vivace from work. I also wanted to make sure to reserve a patio table in case the entire city decided to converge on this beautiful patio just like I planned to. In my experience, this town loves nothing quite so much as a warm, sunny day and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat on a patio on those days. Apparently my patio-day ideas aren't actually that unique.   I arrived before the hubs and sat enjoying the combination of a cool glass of wine, the warm sunshine and the striking view of Charlotte's skyline. I was a little Zen-ed out by the time he showed up, I'm not going to lie. After much deliberation over the menu (more than one or two things sounded good), I ordered a caesar salad and the four cheese ravioli. Hubs ordered the caesar salad and the corzetti with wild boar. I had almost ordered this myself as I'd never heard of corzetti before. I checked the menu earlier in the day and googled it. (I like to be prepared!) It's a flat round pasta shaped like a large coin.  The salads came out and were okay. They were very lightly dressed so many of the pieces of romaine just tasted like bare romaine. Is it uncouth to wish for more dressing on one's caesar? I'm not talking a metric ton of it, but just enough that it doesn't seem like I'm just eating plain lettuce. However, the lettuce was crisp and the flavor was good. It was definitely edible and not something I was upset enough about to send it back. Also I was really hungry.  The entrees came and were both quite pleasing to look at. My ravioli had a light tomato sauce that was complementary instead of overpowering. The garlic crema was delicious. The pasta was topped with wilted spinach, which I don't normally eat, but I included in my bites so I could say I have a vegetable with dinner. It was good with the pasta. Hubs really liked his pasta and he doesn't ever like restaurant pasta. I had to talk him into the dish so I was relieved that he enjoyed it. The wild boar ragout was the perfect complement to the corzetti and the cheese.   Both pastas were the epitome of what I look for in restaurant pasta - unique in some way, fresh and certainly nowhere near just a mess of soggy noodles drowned in a tasteless red sauce. I feel like so many places still serve pasta that way and both hubs and I always steer clear. This was different and delicious.   The service was good, but got a little harried toward the end. I got a fresh glass of wine, which I had almost finished by the time the waiter came back to see what drink hubs wanted next. But looking around, it seemed like he was covering all the patio tables and it was pretty full by this time. I think he should've had some help as he looked like he was spread pretty thin so I'm not blaming him for the snafu. He was very friendly, though, and knowledgable about the food.   In all it was a very positive experience. I got to sit in the sunshine and enjoy some good food and good wine. And I'll almost definitely be back, probably to try the brunch I keep hearing so much about. Bottomless mimosas? I'm in!",

    "text": "I recently attended an event in their private upstairs dining space. This space is FANTASTIC for private events, small receptions, or even (hint, hint), holiday functions! It has a private and fully-stocked bar, a large space that can be appointed to seat a fair number of guests (or, set up for over 100 if you do hors d'oeuvres (lighter food far, antipasto, appetizers...). Additionally, there is a beautiful (really nice!) private terrace/balcony up there. I was able to meet the event manager David, and he was delightful. I'll try to remember to upload a picture of his card. He was very bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed, and super friendly.   The way they do events is quite simple, and reasonable... you don't have to pay a deposit, instead, you simply sign a contract committing to rent the space, and have a minimum to spend on food/bev. So if you want to have a sit down dinner with x guests, he'll just work with you and say we just need you to spend at least $x on food and beverage. I'll add, this is exactly how we've done it at Ruth's Chris and other CLT establishments for my holiday parties. You also have the option of setting a specific menu, going a la cart, or, picking what apps/etc you want set out or passed. They'll work with you.   Also, they have complimentary valet (don't forget to tip!). This is a MUST for any restaurant in Charlotte. While there is a free and close parking deck, I prefer the convenience of pulling up and letting someone else worry about finding a spot. :) Plus, (random factoid), they're next to Trader Joes - so you can stock up on that oh-so-delicious Cookie Butter. Dang it, now I want Cookie Butter. I digress...  The particular event I went to only had hors d'oeuvres, which simply means I didn't get a chance to try their entrees or pastas (which I would have liked to try). Oh well, it gives me a goal next time I'm there. So what did I try? I first had what the waiter said was blue cheese stuffed fig. Errr... I like fig, and I love blue (or any kind of funky-) cheese, but I was not a fan of this. But, don't let that discourage you because many of my fellow guests did seem to enjoy it. For me, the ratio of bold cheese (really bold!) to fig was off. Dare I say, too much cheese? GASP! I said it... oh well. (Though, really, you can't ever have too much cheese... or bacon.) Darn, I'm off track again.   Ok... where was I? Oh yes, hors d'oeuvres. They had oodles of olives (that's fun to say... try saying it 10 times fast!). The olives were fresh, flavorful and diverse. Yum! They also had blue cheese stuffed olives, which I enjoyed! Of course, you have to appreciate both olives and blue cheese - if you do, this would be a treat. We had a huge antipasto platter to pull from. It had an olive spread (almost like a tapenade meets hummus), which was good on their pita-breads. They had an assortment of quality meats (spicy and yummy salami and pepperoni), and even better quality cheeses on the platter. Now, the show stopper for the night was the cheesy fried risotto balls. Let me be clear, if you dine here (event of not), you MUST ORDER THESE! Delicious and perfectly balanced. They went very quickly, and despite the lovely staff hustling to refill them, they would run out many times before the platter made it to the table. That good!  Lastly, I cannot forget to comment on the drinks. They had VERY STIFF drinks (read: strong). This I actually think is an upsell... I had trouble drinking my mixed drink, but generally, when I pay the market rate for a mixed drink, I want value in the booze-to-mix ratio. This place has it down! Of course, they have a great assortment of wine and beer as well.  So, while I can't comment on the traditional dining service, or the heavier entrees, I do recommend Vivace based on my experiences here. Great location, easy to get to, valet parking, and quality ingredients in a modern-but-sleek restaurant.",

While Vivino has ambience and might be a great place for a work dinner, the food was utterly bland. I am not a salt fiend - in fact my husband is on a salt-conscious diet, but both the Tuscan  bean dip amuse bouche and the artichoke ricotta pizza were virtually devoid of salt. The bread was unexceptional - they could have bought it locally for all the character it had.  While the crust of my pizza was crispy and the hint of lemon worked with the arugula and artichokes, I feel like I would have had better value ordering a delivery pizza.

Delicious calamari (huge portion, enough to take home) and a good caprese salad. We both had pasta for our mains that were also good.  Overall the atmosphere was more remarkable than the meal, but we will go again for sure.",

This place has the more upscale Italian fare with plenty of entrees that I can't even pronounce! :D  I initially ate here over a year ago & had a nice shrimp pasta dish, that they don't even carry on the menu anymore. I remembered liking it because it was a simple dish with a light sauce that wasn't the typical marinara type sauce.  Since that outing, I've been here a couple more times in the bar area. The drinks are delicious & refreshing & they have an extensive wine list.  The bartenders are always nice & are quick to give you recommendations.  I love the interior of the restaurant...fresh, modern, & upscale. Their patio seating is nice, as well.   Other notes: pricey!  They offer banquet menus, the restaurant is great for groups, they have a meatless options menu, valet parking, & lunch & brunch.",

I've finished meals off with the carefully measured portion of limoncello and watched fresh basil bake into the home-made mozzarella of a crisp wood-fired pizza as the pomodoro sizzles gently underneath.   I find myself back in Rome when I visit Vivace; a masterpiece of fine dining and a treasure found in the heart of Charlotte. Wonderfully contemporary, yet traditional at heart, this restaurant evokes everything one would expect from a top-tier Italian restaurant.   We began the meal with the Gnocchi alla Romana with spicy sauteed shrimp, white wine and herb crema. Each flavor danced in my mouth after every bite, distinguishing itself through the freshness of ingredients and mastery of cooking technique. The primi was followed by a Chicken Cappelini (housemade pasta) tossed in a sun-dried tomato cream sauce, crispy pancetta, and topped with arugula. The richness of this dish was not overpowering and the saltiness of the pork rounded the dish off well, thereby achieving perfect balance in taste. I then finished with an enormous portion of Italian gelato and of course, an arancello (a sweet concentrated shot of sweet orange liquor 40% av.) to take me to the next level :)  Our server was prompt, kind, and knowledgeable. He had wonderful recommendations and even replaced a melting gelato of his own volition because he had thought it was overly melted.   It's restaurants like these that deserve recognition and acclaim in the wider gastronomic community. I commend the staff here and will be back again soon.  5/5",

We arrived right at 12 and realized we should have made a reservation. Fortunately, they were able to squeeze us in at a spot upstairs (excellent city views). For $25 you get bottomless mimosas and bloody marys and then an appetizer and a main.   Throughout the whole meal, the drinks were flowing. I opted for mimosas and my husband the bloody. They just had pitchers and would keep refilling!  For appetizer, I got the baked oysters and my husband got the meatballs. The oysters were absolutely fantastic. Baked with cheese and some small lobster bites. The meatballs were equally as tasty and the sauce was perfect. For mains, I got the shrimp and grits and my husband got the fried chicken and gravy sandwich. The shrimp and grits were very good....large shrimp! However, we both decided that the chicken and gravy sandwich was the winner. Excellent combination of flavors!   So excited that we discovered this brunch as it will definitely be a regular spot!",

The tricky part for me was that this was my first week on weight watchers and didn't want to use all of my points on lunch. Lucky this delicious arugula salad with grilled shrimp and scallops didn't rack up many points at all and offered some delicious flavors, didn't use much of the lemon vinaigrette as it was mostly oil.

    "text": "Was at Vivace about a year ago, and was such a wonderful experience - I gave it five stars.  Been a while, and celebrating a birthday, we decided to go to Vivace for brunch.  We called to make a reservation, and indicated we would like to sit outside -- this seems to cause a lot of confusion.  We were told they don't reserve the tables outside -  we indicate we are on our way, and should be there in about fifteen minutes.  I've said it before, the Host/Hostess is the first impression for any restaurant.  The host we had today, should not be in that role.  We arrive and ask for a table for two, and would like to be outside.  They ask if we have a reservation, and I go to explain we called and were told they don't reserve the outside tables.  I was now under the impression they don't have any tables as the host stated we could sit at the couch area with coffee tables.  I state we'd just rather wait for a table-now there seems to be a table and immediately seats us.  The host sits us by the door, and I hate sitting by the door, and asked if we could sit at a different table, as there were plenty open tables.  He responds, NO, those tables are reserved, and had a smirk!  This made my blood boil. I just wanted to leave, but I go to ask for a manager.  After going in to ask for a manager others at the restaurant intercept and correct the table situation  -- now it's no problem to sit at another table?  This pretty much set the pace and mood for the rest of the brunch.  It was embarrassing, and my brunch was not as enjoyable as it could have been, I was actually a wreck - we were really looking forward to a repeat of the first visit.  Today, I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, and they were very good - the dish wasn't very hot, but warm - the flavors were good.  My companion had the Eggs Benedict, and her food wasn't hot, even warm to say the least.  At this point, I asked not say anything more, as I've already made enough fuss over the table. Others at the restaurant apologized for our experience and stated the host was new.  He shouldn't be a host without proper training - dealing with the customer, again first impression.  This could have been handled so much better.  I was very adamant I didn't want him taking care of our table, and guess who brings our food out.    Quite honestly, not sure if I want to go back - certainly not for brunch, as we have many other places that we enjoy - better overall experience.  Even more disappointing, is no one from the restaurant ever reached out to discuss--they must not care",

Hubby had the Bolonese and I had Saltimbocca. He enjoyed the pasta and had lobster added which was excellent. While I really enjoyed the veal - serving size was such it could be enjoyed without taking home half.   The cheesecake dessert was remarkably light and a great topper. We will definitely visit again.",

Nothing was bad by any means, but nothing particularly stood out to me or blew me away like other spots I visited while touring Charlotte. However, while i didn't necessarily think any of their food was particularly special, they have a fun bottomless brunch idea where you can interchange between mimosas and bloody Marys, have an appetizer and an entree all for 30$, which makes you feel as if you're truly getting your bang for your buck.",

    "text": "I choose this place for a birthday brunch because of the bottomless mimosa's.. My crowd is large and rowdy so I asked for a private room- they graciously accommodated. Once everyone arrived, we were seated with one server handling a table of 14.  It was partly our fault because the room is designed for 12 and they squeezed in two more for us. Being a peak time for the restaurant, we sat for almost 40 minutes with no drinks.  Since we came for the bottomless mimosa's- that wasn't working for us. The manager stepped in and quickly made the situation better, and proceeded to probably overserve us!! We were so pleased that we progressed to the bar and then the lovely patio for the rest of the afternoon. I think this restaurant needs kuddos for exceptional service!! Everyone in the service industry gets backed up at one time or another - it's how you handle it that is the mark of excellence.  Vivace - you won us over, we will be back!!",

    "text": "Well, I must admit, I didn't get overwhelmingly impressed by Vivace.  The location and atmosphere is very good and a great meet up spot.  The interior is a modern mix of some great elements though the overall scheme is a bit confusing.  That being said, the food was okay...nothing spectactular and I could attribute it to our menu choices, but I'm not sure I will.  A fellow yelper and I chose two different pizzas and they were both good, though nothing only available at Vivace.  He ordered the chilled tomato and cucumber soup and it was pretty good and his favorite selection of this visit.  For dessert we sampled the Expresso Cheesecake which could have used some depth either with more flavor or the addition of a complement to the expresso ...either way it was lacking in full flavor.  We also had several flavors of gelato...cherry vanilla, mint chocolate chip and sweet corn...they were all okay - the mint was by far my favorite.  Our service was great!  She was attentive, offered suggestions, answered our questions and never let our glasses get empty...I almost gave a 4th star for that, but decided against it because the overall experience was just nothing super special.  If invited to return I would go and try something else, but I doubt I would seek out another meal here on my own.  Points for a cool place to meet up in a neat spot with friends or for a date - but an A-OK for my experience with the meal.",

    "text": "I heard fantastic things about Vivace Charlotte and was excited to try to new brunch menu. 2 friends and I made a reservation, (it was CIAA weekend and we thought it would be very busy so we planned ahead.)  Once seated, it took a few min for someone to great us, which is pretty normal considering the amount of people that were arriving for brunch. Finally our server came over, introduced the menu and introduced the new $25.00 brunch menu. She advised that the bottomless drinks are ONLY available if we take the 25.00 option and if not we would pay full price for each drink. None of us were that hungry to have 2 full dishes but thought, \"hey we can enjoy 25.00 worth of mimosa's\"   I ordered a mimosa with grapefruit and was told it was an up-charge for each one to add grapefruit. I advised that I medically can't have OJ and asked that they simply replace it, and was told no. I asked for just champagne and was told, \"No, everything is pre-made\" So I opted for the bloody mary bar, which I enjoyed very much!!  It was a good choice.   For more on the drinks, not sure if it was because the volume of people or a restaurant rule, but we waited about 15-20 min to order a second drink, we even had to ask a different server since ours seemed to be to concerned with her 2 tables of 6+ people. Even after ordering we had to wait another 10 min to get the drink so we ate our food - (which was average) without beverages (including water). After another 20 min we tried to order a third drink, and were ignored. Finally our waitress came over and we asked for the third drink, she apologized and said it was on the way, 10 min later still no drinks. We finally flagged her down, asked about the drinks and she looked confused and said, \"no-one brought them?\"  At that point (1 hour 30min into brunch) we just asked for the checks. Needless to say we were bummed that we didn't get the enjoy the\"bottomless\" alcohol as advertised. (not that we drink that much but it was a bit upsetting)  Once the bill came, we started to pay and my friend pointed out that the brunch was not $25.00 as stated on the menu and by our server, it was actually 27.52 plus tax, which made the bill $29.79. At that point, my table of friends became very annoyed. We paid our bills and waited to speak with the manager on duty about the $2.52 difference in the check. Granted, it's only $2.52 but if everyone in the restaurant that day had the $25.00 advertised brunch but were really charged, $27.52 that s HUGE increase towards profit. We spoke to the manager about the price difference and he said he was sorry that this was a new process and the computer systems were not updated yet, they have been only doing this for 2 weeks, so basically overcharging customers for 2 weeks. Again $2.52 isn't a huge deal for 1 person but say you have 400 patrons over 2 weeks at $2.52 that's $1008.00 extra in overcharges. The manager again apologized and offered to credit us the $2.52. We were already out the door and said never mind, but we just wanted to bring it to his attention. Other people may not be as nice about it.  The owner Kevin Jennings emailed me about participating in a program with Vivace and asked me for my candid feedback. To which I sent the above in a email and I never heard back from him or anyone in their corporate office.",

The brunch menu looks really good and it was gorgeous weather out so we were able to sit outside.    The meal started off well - we got the Bruschetta app.  It was so different, but good different.  It had cauliflower on it and it just tasted good.  I ordered the open face panino for my entree.  It was sooo rich and heavy.  The cheese sauce was so overpowering and salty and my food was drenched in it, so it wasn't the best... Two people we went with ordered the grilled hanger steak entree.  Both steaks had significant amounts of char/burnt edges on it.  No one was overly impressed.  Also, just as a side note, we all forgot that you can't order alcohol before 12 on Sundays and we overheard a lot of other tables trying to order mimosas and stuff as well.  I was kind of disappointed to have brunch without a mimosa, but not their fault that's the law.  I wish we went at 12 instead of 11 though.",

I think they do a good job with their pastas etc. On my last visit (June 2015) there I ordered the ribeye (medium rare) and it looked beautiful, perfectly glazed, and flash broiled at the very end for the sear. Unfortunately, I could barely cut the steak and once I was able cut a piece, the next challenge was chewing it. My client looked at me like I was trying to chew an entire pack of Starburst at once. I chewed through several pieces and threw in the towel. I will give them another chance, but will likely order something else.",

As expected with an Italian restaurant, the wine selection is very nice.

On this particular occasion I tried a few of their brick oven pizzas (I would highly recommend the Amor di Carne), and for dessert... OH MY GOSH are they generous with their gelato!

I'm definitely not a fan of hip, trendy places with no substance so I was wary, but the food and service delivered 100 percent.  The gnocchi appetizer was delicious.   The caesar salad was a bit cheese-heavy but still good.   I was feeling adventurous so I tried the Scallop Risotto with beets and spinach.  Amazing!   My boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatballs and though the pasta seemed a bit thick to be a spaghetti, it was all really good.     If you still have room, get some dessert.   They make their own liquors there - I tried the orangecello to go with the chocolate molten cake, but they also have lime, lemon and seasonal strawberry.   Strong but good.    The cake was everything I wanted it to be.   Yum!  As for our service, we sat upstairs and were not wanting for more water, drinks, food, etc.   He was really on top of his game and made the experience that much better.",

    "text": "I have always been a fan of Vivace, but this new spring menu is blowing my mind-- definitely worth going in to check out. A few of my favorite highlights?  -Cheese plate offerings- Crucolo Trentino? Where else can you find that outside of Alto Adige? FINALLY a chef that isn't just dialing in his cheese selection (no more Maytag blue, pleeease.)  -LOVE the chilled hazelnut soup with muscadine granita-- what a cool (get it ha) and delicious way to incorporate something SO quintessential North Carolina with Italian ingredients -- local meets tradition!  -One app is simply house churned butters and homemade bread -- need I say more?  All the pasta dishes are lovely - mostly due to the fact that they are cooked and seasoned properly, and not overly intricate- LOVE that they come in two sizes too so that you can share....or not..  I usually just share a bunch of the small plates with friends (who doesn't love to eat like that?) but if I do get a main entree it would have to be the NC Triggerfish. The sweet corn and nutty farro ragout that the fish rests upon could be a meal in itself - especially with the grilled oyster mushrooms that also accompany the dish. Add that fresh, sweet, mild fish atop and you're in for a memorable dinner.   Usually you don't get lucky and get great food AND a good wine list -- which is why Vivace got the 5th star for me. All Italian, a lot of small family owned producers, unusual grapes you don't typically see (think Cococciola from Abruzzo--a yummy crisp white) and most importantly -- NOT at every other restaurant in Charlotte.  Not to mention with the design of the restaurant you can't help but feel sexy while sipping whatever little libation you choose...  Looking forward to my next visit!!!",

The new menu provided the best meal my wife and I have had at this restaurant.  Really happy for them.  I'm super critical and not easily please but they hit it out of the park.  My wife loved her salmon and my swordfish was on the more savory side just to my liking.  This has been the best italian meal i've had in Charlotte for 9 years.  Great Job.",

I hogged most of the tray and only let a few pieces of the meats and cheeses go because I'm a nice person. ;)  The veal was good, but not particularly memorable.  The interior of the restaurant is great, with cool lighting, two floors, and a bar area that is marked off by a partial wall.  Until I find another decent cheese plate in this city, Vivace is going to be my go-to for this Italian staple.",

It's pretty good, but not good enough that I would come back. That being said, this may have been partially due to the fact that we came during Queen's Feast, so the kitchen may have been overwhelmed. I'd come back and give them a second chance next time I'm in the area, because their menu was inventive and decor was excellent. I also thought, considering the crowd, our server was extremely effective.",

I thought for restaurant week they might be a little smaller..nope not here! I got the little neck clams to start. The clams were so flavorful! Such unique flavors, uh I loved them. Next was the prosciutto-wrapped pork tenderloin with sage gnocchi, roasted garlic crema, tomato polenta. Ahhh, so delicious! Great presentation.  And lastly, the black and white tiramisu. It was perfect!  I can't wait to come back! I am looking forward to sitting outside and enjoying their patio this summer!",

Vivace - whether you pronounce it vi-va-chi or vi-va-che - has your favorite Sunday brunch until 3pm. That's pretty cool. Especially because I went there around 2pm feeling a ton like having toast and eggs.  We didn't exactly get off on the right foot. They made me and my wife wait for somewhere around 15 minutes. It was 2pm on a Sunday afternoon, and you could see that it's not jam packed in there - or outside. But I did see that they were working on it so I didn't say anything (although my voice became a bit of a megaphone towards the end when I said, \"are you guys ready?!\").  In any case, I had the Benedicto Vivace. On point. Right on, guys! Great job with the fries and the eggs! Really, I didn't expect it to be sooo good but it was. The egg was just right with perfect color and texture. The fries were not greasy or burned but had the right degree of crispness (?). Oh, and the lemonade that I ordered to go with it killed it. Man, did I enjoy my third meal of that day. (Yes, I had breakfast and lunch before that. But...)  So there you go. And tonight, fellow Yelpers and I shall check out how it's like there at night! So stay tuned!",

Was excited to sit down and enjoy a full on meal after seeing the ambiance and decor of the inside of the place. I'll be honest, the parking situation at the Metropolitan had kept me away for so long. However, they have valet so can't even look at that as a negative.   Decor, food taste and selection as well as service for the price point. This was truly a 5-star brunch!  We arrived a few minutes early and took a seat near the spacious bar. Were promptly seated once the others arrived. Our waiter briefly explained the brunch options and got us started on drinks. Honestly he was one of the best servers I've had recently and I wish I had gotten his name to pass along the praise.   The food selection for brunch was one of the largest and most interesting I've seen anywhere in Charlotte. I had the polenta for a starter (pictured) and eggs Benedict for my main. All delicious. I'll mention the Benedict comes on thick bread which I expected to be difficult to cut - no way, it was soft and easy to eat!  Did they think of everything??   Two thumbs up and five star for sure. I'll be back!",

I don't know where they hire the people that work there, but I am so over how we are treated everytime we walk in the door.    As residents of the Metropolitan, you would think they would at least remember that we lived upstairs, but after a year and a half, nothing.  They are rude, unprofessional, and completely unaware.    We have tried to give them several chances and tonight was our last.  We called in to order food for \"pick up\" and they told us it would take 40 min before our food would be ready.  We waited upstairs, in our home, for 40 min, walked downstairs to grab our food, and the bartender says, \"wow, I thought I would be getting a free dinner tonight because I didn't think you guys were coming!\".  I then told him, we were told to come in 40 min, and he backtracked by saying, \"oh yea, it has been really busy tonight, it probably did take about 40 min\".  No it didn't because our food was cold and had clearly been sitting there for a while.   Then he tells us, if he were us, he would have came a bit earlier to grab drinks while we waited for our food.  If we wanted to do that, we would have.  We just wanted to order a quick meal to take back up to our place...we definitely did not need him to tell us, \"what we should have done\".   Almost all of the residents feel the same about Vivace, so I doubt any of their business comes from us, which reflects poor management.    I don't even have the time to get into everything else they have done to piss us off in the past year.  My $$ and business will continue to go to Dressler's and Pisces where they treat the locals like family.  Take a hint Vivace.",

The best meal that stands out in my mind is the  fig and prosciutto pizza. We loved it so much each time that we ordered two. The mussels are also delicious. The ambiance inside and outside are nice.

    "text": "Well I know a lot of people have been saying ooh I wonder if Vivace is still as good now that the head chef has left to make his own artisanal cheeses?  Answer, YES! For me, in some ways it is even better because it still holds True to the bold use of the real flavors of Italy, maintaining a focus on fresh local ingredients. You will never fin anything from a can here and you will find flavors from the north as well as the coast. True Italian specialties like gelato, pignolia tarts, dark cherry, black ink pasta, and now a beautiful salmon chop. That's a nice addition and for someone like me watching their cholesterol it was so nice to see a simple  capelinni with heirloom tomatoes and beautiful basil, with just a hint of chili. Thank you new head chef. Everything was always meet and cheese centric and I always felt weird asking for a vegan option and explaining about my health issues. I always loved the restaurant and now I can come more often.",

The endless wall of wine is also adds to the \"wow factor.\"  Whether you are seated upstairs or down, you are bound to have good service and great food.  I've had something as simple as a pizza (which was delicious) to a few of their more expensive seafood dishes.  I've never been disappointed.    Parking can be very tight so I would recommend taking advantage of the complimentary valet service.  I would also recommend making a reservation if you are looking to get dinner on a Friday or Saturday evening.    If you are looking to grab some drinks on some comfy outdoor couches, head upstairs toward the bar and you can catch a great view!",

It's visually stunning with a warm feel but with a contemporary style which can sometimes be hard to pull off.  They do it perfectly!   Ok, so service was a little slow in the beginning during the drink order but became increasingly better.  In terms of drinks from the bar, the Sangria was lacking in my opinion.  A bit on the sour side to me.  I paired my meal with the house Merlot and it was just fine, perfect temp, etc.  The meal I ate was the crab stuffed trout on a bed of asparagus.  It was fantastic! Apparently I won the Clean Plate Award ;).  The crab stuffing was delicious and the presentation was spot on as well.  The best part about this place to me was the patio atmosphere upstairs.  They have a large moveable glass partition that opens up the second floor loft out into a patio area (w/heaters!) and the furniture is ultra comfortable.  A great spot to have a final glass of Merlot and wind down after the meal.  The only thing bringing this rating down to a 4 was the slow start and the Sangria....otherwise, total 5 star place.",

I liked that the restaurant offered small portions as it allowed me room for dessert. Of course I had to try the tiramisu which was delicious.

Gorgeous for night and day.  Amazing service, Emmanuel helped us out and was incredibly attentive and thoughtful.   Awesome design, decor and music. This place is sleek but comfortable and completely relaxing.  Great food at reasonable prices- a good place to get Italian deli meats and thin crust pizza. Really enjoyable and delicious.  We just stopped in this place as we were traveling through town, thanks fellow yelpers, and it really made our day. Do the same, you won't regret it :)    - - - -  On the downside, their homemade ricotta is pretty off. It shouldn't be soup. Also the pizza dough is really close but not quite right -  It shouldn't be chip-like at the crust and should have that nice powder on it. Meats need to be cut better, and I think they have a loose understanding of what speck is. Their pecorino was pretty good though.   I have no doubt that these guys will get it right , and very soon. They seem to be working hard to perfect their dishes.",

    "text": "Sadly I have to give a poor rating to this restaurant which was in my top 5 for charlotte. This past experience has permanently removed it from the list of places I will spend my money. I am very tolerant of set backs and mistakes but when it happens not by chance it warrants this type of review. My reservation was for 12 people to welcome a friend back to charlotte for an outside cabana this past weekend. On arrival we were told all we have left is this one table, without an umbrella, that seats 5. Promptly we asked to speak  with the manager on this Sunday who unapologetically explained that they changed their policy regarding reserving cabanas. We never received a call explaining this prior to our arrival but were left with option of a table inside or outside which would only accommodate 5. We sat waiting for the rest of the party before making other arrangements despite the fact as we went outside there were not one but 2 tables with reserved signs on them. The rest of the meal went as badly as it started. The waitress I can forgive as she was new and obviously overwhelmed. But it must be noted that food and drink was slow even for a busy Sunday. By time our appetizers arrived, over an hour later, the sun was to high for us to remain outside at the only table without an umbrella, so we made our way inside. Out entrees arrived after being read off and placed in front of what we assumed was the correct person. My eggs were well done but cold. Two others they mistakenly gave the wrong dishes too. This normally wouldn't be a big except the waiter specifically asked who has frittata with shrimp and gave it to the wrong person. After taking a bite and eating shrimp (which upset me as a nurse because that individual could have been highly allergic) we then found out it was another persons meal. Followed by another taking a bite of there food to end up with a bug on her lip! That sealed the deal on this lack luster experience. We promptly asked our waitress who was apologetic to speak to the manager. Unsure whether or not we can use names on this site, lets just say the manager on Sunday is in need of further training on how to provide good customer service. From the moment we explained our \"current\" issues he immediately started providing excuses. Never once was he apologetic. After the bug dealer breaker which we informed him ended our meal and uneaten food he informs us he will take care of our bill. With that we made our way out to find a restaurant where we could eat.  Half way down the block the same manager ran after us stating \"I took care of the food but you still have a drink bill\". We informed him we thought he meant out bill in its entirety was taken care of and proceed back towards the restaurant to pay for our drinks. Another member of the party let the manager dispute the poor service what made the experience intolerable was his attitude towards us. He immediately again went on the defensive, provided excuses and concluded with his attitude was a reaction to  being cornered by one of the gentlemen in our party regarding the seating issue when we first arrived. Prior to this moment I would have called this a one off or vivace. After hearing this we realized our poor service and meals were most likely on purpose due to the bias of the manager of the day.  He felt \"cornered\" .....in the lobby entrance of the restaurant ....as manager who is suppose to field issues and problems??? I hate saying this as I feel very disheartened witnessing this type of behavior but the only reason I can conclude for him feeling this way was because we were minorities. I can pretty much safely make this conclusion based on the passive aggressive nature of this rest of our meal.  As well as recalling an incident that occurred on my birthday dinner a year prior that involved wrong seating as well. That night resulted in a round of prosecco for the table. Same incident two different reactions. One difference....the ethnicity of the patrons. I'm sad to see vivace off of my list of places to visit  and recommend but the unrecognized/unchecked bias by management was too insulting to ignore. Embarrassed by what I presumed to be an upscale establishment to have such low standards for its treatment of its patrons I will not make the mistake of recommending it to any of my friends or colleagues.",

I'm not a big fan of The Metropolitan and it's \"big box\" tenants, but Vivace has created a great space both indoors and outside. As stylish as any major city restaurant. I have had a great meal every time I've visited for lunch or dinner. I especially like eating in the bar/lounge area. I sat upstairs once and it was incredibly noisy, but it was a packed Saturday night.  The only reason I'm not giving it \"5 stars\" is because of the rancid mussel in my bowl at lunch one day. They offered to replace the dish which seemed unappetizing at the time. If I owned the place, I would have offered another appetizer selection on the house, but they just took it off the bill and said no more. I have ordered the mussels since on another visit and they were exceptional. Although, if you're on a low sodium diet, find another selection. The broth is divine, but major salty.  Vivace is a good choice for any occasion...",

Our server Ariel was excited to show off the new menu and was very proud that all sauces, pasta, and doughs were made in house with all ingredients sourced local. Having been several times, I can't even say now why Vivace was never really memorable - I knew it was very good but for some reason it just wasn't on my absolute top lists for Italian I'm Charlotte. I don't immediately recall the executive chef's name, just that Ariel mentioned he was relatively newer to that post and that he really poured his heart and vision into every dish. DAMN, was she right. Our party enjoyed Caesar salad, burrata, field green salad, the Alaskan halibut (which was always our favorite special and excited to see on the full menu, Bolognese pasta, roasted salmon, and the fusilli vodka. Gluten free options were plenty and all but ONE of the above dishes mentioned were completely cleaned plates. I would bathe in the vodka sauce it was that good. We also enjoyed the gelato (chocolate, espresso, and wickedly but awesomely salted caramel), tiramisu (which is now the best I've ever enjoyed), and the orange cheesecake that was basically a high class orange creamsicle. We also enjoyed classics like Old Fashioned and Dirty Martini while I loved the Uber refreshing lemon Italian Mojito (enjoying a few of those on their awesome patio overlooking the greenway and cityscape is definitely in my future), and a wine that Ariel perfectly paired to my dad's pasta dish. Overall, just a beyond exceeding expectations dinner with fabulous, down to earth service and food too good to put into words. Vivace was always underrated, but they have outdone themselves with the new menu and new chef. KUDOS and welcome to one of my top restaurant experiences in Charlotte list.",

They also have a really nice outdoor seating area, which I would highly recommend requesting.   I always get the \"The Vivace Way\". This is ALL YOU CAN DRINK mimosas or bloody mary's. And when I say all you can drink, I mean all you can drink. (Side note: they make their own bloody mary mix which in my opinion is sub-par. Every time I come back here I hope that it has magically changed, but unfortunately it isn't worth it. However, you can mix and match your drinks which is nice). This also includes an appetizer and an entree for ONLY 30 DOLLARS.   I would recommend trying the calamari or the mussels, both are incredible. The quiche is great, the eggs benedict are also great. The pappardelle is also great. I did get the chicken sandwich and it wasn't bad on any means, but I think there are better options on the menu.   If you are looking for a FANTASTIC deal and great food/brunch spot in Charlotte, YOU NEED TO GO HERE! NOW! GO GO GO!",

That's just common curtesy in my book. Walking in I asked the hostess to direct me to the bar, she seemed annoyed by that, sorry my bad!  I grabbed a seat at the bar and was greeted by the bartender. After beginning to look at the menu for a few moments he realized he had given me the wrong one, whoops. I inquired about w gluten free menu which their website says they have. It's also written on the bottom of their regular menu that a gluten free menu is a available. However I was told by the bartender that there wasn't one and that they could just modify most thing. This was slightly confusing. I had also reviewed the menu online and had an idea what I wanted prior to arriving but once I got there the menu was completely different than the one online, that was disappointing.   I ended up ordering a pasta dishes called Bugatini with gluten free noodles, basically it was just a spicy red sauce. It was fine but certainly nothing special and not worth $18. Overall, it was just okay, nothing worthy of a second visit.",

    "text": "Vivace is conveniently located off the greenway, within walking distance from Carolina Medical Center. My brother and I walked here to celebrate my birthday after visiting my mom in the ICU last month. There's lots of seating both indoor and outdoor and would be a nice place to eat outside and people watch when it's warm outside like nowadays.  It's wasn't a busy Wednesday night. Our server was good, giving us enough time to review the menu. We split the Brussel Sprouts Antipasti. The portions are generous even for the appetizers. I loved the mix of sweet and savory with the apples, pecans, and smoked pancetta. Maybe a little over dressed with the butter but otherwise my favorite dish of the night. I had the Pappardelle as my entree and it was good, standard fare. Pasta could be a bit more al dente. Again, good portion size so I had enough to take home for a second meal. Overall it was an a-okay meal with a nice and quiet ambiance.",

    "text": "$30 bottom-less mimosa/bloody Mary brunch - enough said!  $30 brunch (we went on Saturday) gets you unlimited mimosas and/or bloody Marys (you can switch back and forth between them as often as you'd like).  You also get two courses (one each from the left and ride sides of the menu).  I got the mussels (weird for brunch, but I love mussels) and the chicken biscuit (similar to a biscuit and gravy with fried chicken on top).    The mussels were fine - but I've had much better.  The chicken biscuit was on point.  You will get a lot of food.  Our table of four shared a bunch of our items and we couldn't finish out plates.  Now, the 3854 mimosas maybe filled us up, but the food was still all pretty good.  Now, the mimosas.  Let's just say, we uber'ed there and back - and I'm very happy that we did.  Our boozy brunch turned into a 4pm bedtime - and a pretty nice headache.  We will definitely check it out again - likely for brunch.  I'll just pace my mimosas better next time.",

I was here this past weekend twice because it was so good to me. They have a good deal that includes endless mimosa or bloody Mary's, an appetizer, and entree for $30. I feel like you can't beat it. I ordered the mussels for my app and mushroom frittata( similar to an omelette). I feel like it was very fulfilling and they did a good job on keeping the mimosas flowing.

We arrived around 9:15 and weren't concerned about the time because they close at 11pm.  However, when we were finally seated and about to order we found out they were out of most of the appetizers listed on the menu.  We decide on a meal and ordered, only to find out they were also out of the entree my wife ordered.  She was obviously bothered but we decided to stick it out.  My wife ordered the Lobster Bisque as an appetizer, but it came out ice cold.  She sent it back and they remade it, it was great other then the additional 5 Mins we had to sit for a spoon.    We were offered bread, but had to remind the server 3 times to bring it.  It was all pretty bad until the entrees came.  The salmon and the beef tenderloin were delicious.  I guess this was the saving grace for our review.  Our rating is a 2.5.... Not sure if we'd come again.",

    "text": "I'm really torn on how to write this review.....   I was so excited to find a place that has bottomless drinks and takes reservations.    We had a party of five and got there at 11:45 on Sunday.  We waited forever for our order to be taken.  Three of us got the vivace way and the other two just ordered drinks and food.  The drinks were slowly brought out, but my first course was brought out quickly.  It was a salad that was actually really good.    We all waited a really long time for drink refills, which was disappointing.  For the main course three of us ordered salmon.  One of them was cooked perfect and the other two were really burnt.  We had to send them back.  As a side note I haven't had to send food back at a restaurant in forever.    When they were brought back out one was under cooked and one had hair on it.  We kept the under cooked one and sent the one back with the hair in it.   We then ordered a dessert to share.  The dessert was really good, but when the waitress brought it out she winked at us and said it was for a birthday.   We asked for our checks multiple times with one more drink refill.  The poor waitress tried to get the manager and told us she wasn't sure what was going on with the kitchen and why we were having to wait so long.  The manager finally came over and told us he was taking care of the check.  The waitress then brought us our checks and we were all charged for our drinks and for the dessert.  It was very strange.  We all just paid the bill and left.    I don't think it was the waitress' fault for any of it, just seems like the kitchen can't handle the bottomless drinks with a full restaurant.     The environment is really nice and the views of the city are amazing.  I agree with the other Yelp reviews about the slow service.",

Now having been twice (once in substitute of a traditional Easter dinner), we can say that we are hooked.   Again, keep in mind we have only done brunch here. That being said, make a reservation and get here early as reservations and food go quickly! I would recommend going all in and paying the $25 to get the brunch special which includes (2) choices from (2) different food categories, some kind of sweet cranberry bread, and bottomless mimosas or bloody marys. In a way it reminds me of the brunch Heist used to have back when they first opened. As for food suggestions, I don't think you can really go wrong. Both my wife and I tried several different dishes over our visits and enjoyed everything. I will say get the quiche if they still have it. This behemoth sits almost a foot off your plate and was an amazing blend of cheesy, crunchy, and rich. Highly recommend. Also the bottomless drinks don't hurt.",

A small group of us went for brunch yesterday. $25 gets you an appetizer, main course and either bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Marys.   The Bloody Mary mix here has a bite - lots of pepper and horseradish - a nice dense, delicious, refreshing house blend.  I enjoyed the PEI Mussels to start, again some heat, reminiscent of GB's Fiery Mussels but I do have to say the Brussel Sprouts with bacon and potatoes (as much as we've all seen Brussel Sprouts this past year) were simply awesome.  The main course was a tough choice - plenty of great sounding choices to pick from. I opted for Eggs in Purgatory. Whoa momma! Great stuff! A chunky bed of spicy red sauce with Guanciale (cured pork jowl - tastes kind of like a cross between salami and pancetta) and Calabrian Peppers. Add two pieces of smoky grilled bread with perfectly poached eggs on top. I did not regret my choice, at all, but I did get to sample the Short Rib Hash and Quiche Fiorentino (a slab of a portion), both of which I wouldn't hesitate to order next time.  Brunch was indeed impressive. I really enjoyed sitting upstairs as well = much better views of outside and the downstairs dining room. Great service, great price. Very busy on Sundays so make a reservation!!!",

Service was awful, their attempt at a save fell flat, and the much-anticipated seven-course seasonal menu was plain and unimaginative. Initial server spilled water on his first, rambling visit, and never came back to clean it up...we eventually did ourselves, but no one noticed or cared. A simple wine order took 30+ minutes (no exaggeration) to fill, and then came out...wrong. 10 more minutes for them to find the right bottle. Second course arrived while we were still eating the first.  If the food quality of the $55 \"Feast of 7 Fishes\" had been anything close to previous years' visits, it would have helped cover for the bad service. But it was all quite forgettable, including a monkfish \"fritter\" that resembled a cold hushpuppy, and two fish filets that were dry, dull and devoid of any real flavor.",

Why the place was so dead, I haven't a clue because service was spot on, and all dishes were very tasty. I have told others about our experience and I'm hoping this review ushers more consumers in because it's hard to find a restaurant that can prepare a good risotto.",

We opted to seat indoors, since it was humid outside. They took some time to take our order, but were patient enough to answer our queries about vegetarian options.  What we had: Bruschetta - Average Four cheese ravioli - Good Fried Gnocchi on side - Above average Wine - Don't remember the name, but they have quite a lot nice collection here  Overall it was a nice experience and would visit again...",

    "text": "Oh, Vivace. I had long wondered why I was never a huge fan of Italian cuisine. Too many experiences of overly-filled plates of pasta with heavy, sweet sauce I suppose. My negative streak was meant to be broken here! Vivace has tuned my palate to the finer side of Italian eating. These guys have a killer location in Metro and their space is coveted by many. Juxtaposition alone lands them a whopping high-five. Hello, greenway and view of Uptown. Little did I know before my visit.   We stumbled in on a lazy afternoon for a 3:30pm lunch. Perfect timing for a quiet meal on the patio. We had one of their over-sized umbrellas all to our selves with a glorious Uptown backdrop. We weren't even aiming for romantic but it comes standard on the patio. Huge fan.  Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. Took into account the weather (rather hot) and recommended some refreshing appetizers and drinks. Greatly appreciated his recommendations.   I ordered a Limon Cello. Fresh lime juice, triple sec and soda water. Here's the breakdown on the \"Cellos.\" Not an instrument. Nay. In fact, there are several choices and all made from fresh fruits and juices in house. Quite impressive and the freshness doesn't lie.   Apps: Bruschetta. Holy wow. This is the best bruschetta I've had in the Queen City to date. Perfectly balanced with fresh bread, sweetness and fresh basil. The tomatoes are smoked in house. Yes, I said smoked. The flavor is incredible. Comes with six 1-2 bite pieces. Each should be savored and perhaps taken from your fellow diners if they aren't paying attention. I was tempted to lick the plate. Incredible flavors swirling on each crostini of joy.   Cheese Plate. Man. What a treasure trove. We chose all 6 cheeses to try. Served on a woodblock with bread, honey, an apricot marmalade and a cranberry chutney-ish jam. Each cheese had it's own interesting note. Spicy, sweet, fermented, strong, mild and so on. No combination was incorrect with the jams and honey. I'd get this again in a heartbeat.   Entree-ish: Prosciutto di Parma pizza. The dough was thin, chewy and served as a perfect catalyst for the rest of the flavors. Fig spread, Gorgonzola and arugula danced very lightly on my palate and complimented one another nicely. This pizza was great. The proscuitto was only on half since my wife is a vegetarian but it was great. Mild and salty like it should be.   Dessert: Pistachio gelato. Creamy and choc a boc filled with pistachio pieces. Served with a biscotti. I only wish there had been a few more pieces of biscotti since it worked so well with the gelato.   So glad to have tried Vivace finally. Looking forward to heading back in the near future for a further look into their pizzas and greater entree selection. Cheers! (or, Ciao!)",

I didn't really prefer sitting in the bar area because it was a lot of noise and foot traffic. When my friend and I first got there and the waiter was nice, however I could tell that the staff was overwhelmed by the crowd and it took a bit to get out order and drinks however the manager came by and the service got better. If you were thinking about visiting this place for brunch I would highly recommend you come around 11 or wait till around one or 130 after the rush. I have been here for dinner and the food is very good as well as the service.   There is free valet and the parking is free as well in the garage however it is not that great to maneuver around sense it gets quite busy with all of the other retail shops. One thing I can say that stands out about this restaurant is the view of the city as well as the Greenway. It really showcases the city's beauty.  Oh and one more thing, the price is relatively good for brunch you can have bottomless mimosas and two menu items one including an appetizer and main dish for 25 bucks. For dessert it is an extra five dollars. Not too bad when comparing the other restaurants that provide brunch w/no bottomless mimosas.",

Haven't seen this mentioned much, but the menu does offer both vegetarian and gluten free options. Can't vouch for any of them as I like dead animals.  Skipped the Salmon and Tuna, as those are not Italian pesce. Purist in somethings. Went with the Pork Due. Asked for it blushing pink inside and they nailed it. Flavorful, moist and well, yummy.   Negative: wine list offerings seem to be put together by the distributor (not unusual). They need to be paired better with the menu offerings. Beers as well.",

    "text": "This cavernous restaurant just outside of downtown Charlotte is a pleasant and good place to have a meal with those whom you enjoy spending time.  Arrival:  I'm not sure if they still have valet parking, but it seemed like they didn't really need to have it - or have the guys parking the cars in white jackets (this place just isn't that elegant or regal).  Host staff was friendly and had our reservation information detailed accurately.  Plus.    Service:  Mixed.  I suppose this is the south and everyone is pleasant, but they do win points for being kind.  However, our server had limited wine knowledge and really couldn't offer suggestions or insight to those of us who were dining.  Food:  Good!  Not great, but solidly good.  The calamari fritti was a hit, and the caprese salad was acceptable.  The brick oven chicken was a big hit with our table, too, and the ribeye got a nod of approval.  Departure:  On a not-very-busy night during the week, it took a long time for the valet to retrieve our car (or they were short-staffed?).  Minor (and not really the restaurant's fault, technically), but worth noting.",

    "text": "I gave Vivace another shot this past weekend and I am glad I did....  I'm glad I came with a group this time because I was able to sample quite a few different items and we started with a couple of their appetizers which were very good.  We tried the bruchetta, grilled artichoke and the calamari....the bruchetta won the competition and may even be one of the best I've had in town.  The grilled artichoke was a little dry and flavorless but the calamari was on point.  Between the 8 of us we tried quite a few pasta dishes from the very basic spaghetti and meatballs to the homemade cavatelli in a sweet potato cream sauce to their Bolognese that had a goat cheese cream sauce...everything was wonderful!!  I like that they offer full or half portions because the pasta was definitely heavy so the smaller portion was just enough!!  The service was good for the most part...the hostess crew seemed a little dazed and confused but unfortunately that isn't totally abnormal.  They called to confirm my reservation and I told them it went from 10 guests to 8, when I arrived they had me down for a party of 10 and the table was set for 10, yet when other members of the party started to show up they were told there is no party listed under my name...whatever!!  The waitress was lovely and the service the rest of the night was great so that's all that matters.  The food is not what I would classify as Italian...I would say it is Italian-fusion but there is not much about this restaurant that is traditional...I think grandma and grandpa macaluso would be insulted that we call this Italian!  However, they do serve pasta and fish so that has to count for something!    The wine list is pretty diverse and affordable and the menu has something for everyone so that is a huge plus as well.  As so many have mentioned, the atmosphere is beautiful, sleek, trendy and modern.  The view of the city from the balcony is lovely...overall a great experience.",

We started with the steamed pei mussels appetizer, which was delicious. As some others have noted, you'll want to sop up the sauce with bread. My wife also tried two of their specialty drinks, which I can't recall, but were both good. Next we ordered a pappardelle with bolognese to split, and our server brought it on split plates. Also amazing. Finally, my wife and I both ordered the lamb shank over a saffron risotto. Cooked perfectly, and the risotto may have been my favorite part of the meal. I'm a lamb freak/snob - so this was impressive. Apart from the food, our service was outstanding - Meagen was our server.   This was a really great experience that I'd highly recommend to anyone. Easily the best Italian restaurant that I have been to in Charlotte.",

Half way thru my meal I noticed a piece of metal in my food, luckily I did not eat this but it made me loose my appetite immediately. The server was great and promptly brought over the manager, who was very apologetic. It turned out that the metal was part of the steel wool that they used to clean the pans. They offered to take the food portion off my bill and it was greatly appreciated. They asked me if I would like another dish to take home (as I'd lost my appetite for the evening after almost eating metal) which was a nice gesture and I said yes please, if you'd like me to come back. I left that evening with my next day's lunch in my hands and an overall good opinion of Vivace. I had restaurant experience and am well aware of how these things can happen so didn't hold much against them regarding the unfortunate mishap.   The next day I warmed up half of my take out and half way thru eating ended up with another foreign object in my mouth! This time it turned out to be a flimsy piece of plastic the size of a toothpick! I know that these things happen BUT twice in basically one meal is unacceptable and makes me wonder how many other times something like this has happened here and hasn't been reported.   It's unfortunate that this happened because I really did like Vivace's food, atmosphere and service but I can't eat food from a place that has a hazard of choking on metal and plastic.",

So to sum it up, if you aren't picky...give this place a try.  Definitely get the gnocchi appetizer and bypass the hostess at the front door.  Upstairs setting is beautiful and hopefully you will luck up and the get male waiter who is very friendly and very attentive!",

First time i went this place was packed on a Wednesday night! The decor is very nice and so vibrant! The chairs are super comfy which is a plus! Service was good.  First trip had the Proscuitto with figs and bleu cheese...good not spectacular. Then had the Taglitelle Pasta it was good I love cauliflower only wished there was more of that in it but it was good.   Second trip had the Sweet Potato gnocchi with pork belly and cipolini onions.....SO DRY!! Hated every bite of it not even a hint of sweet potato!! I also ordered the Beef Carpaccio I really wish I had taken a picture of this dish because unless you were my sister or my boyfriend sitting at the table with me when this was put down would you even begin to understand how horrendous and Unappetizing this dish looked and tasted! It had what was suppose to be Grilled Radicchio completely covering the whole dish mounded on top of my poor Beef!! It was flavorless NOT grilled and just wrong! OK then we each ordered a pizza I had the salty egg it was good the tomato sauce on it was good! My sister had the Four cheese but only wished she had some tomato sauce on it. Then my boyfriend had the chicken an artichoke pizza and he really liked it...until he bit into his second piece and bit down onto a chicken bone/cartilage...Needless to say he didnt finish it and we sent it back.   The server was apologetic and asked if she could get him anything else, he had lost his appetite though. Then the most awkward manager Ever approaches our table and just stands there for a few seconds and then says \"How about that pizza, Sorry\"  then walks away!! We just looked at one another and laughed!! Where did they find him cause that was the worst customer service EVER!!!   Vivace just needs to do some training starting with their Management (obviously) and then in the kitchen. The things we experienced in our dining experience could have all been prevented if they only took the time to care more about the quality of food that they are putting out!! Sorry!",

We were seated outside and the view was wonderful....the pleasant surprise was just how good the food was....Everything tasted great and presented well....my only regret was not ordering the meat and cheese platter that looked spectacular and tasted just as good (according to the diners at the table next to us).  Vivace features Great view and great food in a lively atmosphere.",

    "text": "Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome, so my returning to Vivace after more than one failed meal is on me.  As I mentioned in my previous review, Vivace is a running joke amongst my friends and me, as we all agree the food is awful, but the location is convienent, their outdoor patio very inviting, and we like the bottomless mimosas on Sunday afternoons.  When I wrote my last review, I did note that their head chef, who was absent last summer, had returned to the kitchen, so when my friend suggested our brunch group give Vivace another go today, I was game.  It was a beautiful day to sit outside on Vivace's beautiful patio overlooking the downtown greenway-great for people watching.  The menu was exactly the same as last year-even if their food was good- it is not a very inviting or cohesive selection.   I had a pannini with tomato, fresh mozzerilla, and basil pesto, and for my side, the house salad.  The salad was fine- hard to mess up.  The \"paninni\" was not a paninni-the tomato, mozzerilla and pesto was served on a chabatti roll, and the sandwich was not grilled- which is what a paninni is- a grilled sandwich.  The cheese was semi-melted, so I guess some attempt at heating it was made, but when it arrived at the table it was cold-fail.  I ate part of half, and the side salad- what a waste of money.  And- they have discontinued the bottomless mimosas- so no need to return.  Too bad- such a great space in a great location- I wish someone who knew good food would intervene and make a go of this place",

    "text": "As others have mentioned -- this is the best new place in Charlotte.  It's also not your standard run of the mill Italian restaurant as mentioned -- this is much better.  Everything hand made in house -- they age their meats and cheese, make their pasta, etc.  The interior design is fantastic, unlike anything in Charlotte.  The view from the second floor is great -- do yourself a favor and head to the 2nd floor for a look or glass of wine outside with a beautiful view of downtown.  The outdoor seating will be awesome during the right time of the year--Charlotte needs something like this.  The food is fantastic, but the service is what sets this place apart -- very knowledgeable staff and very attentive without being overbearing.  Great selection of wines and handcrafted Italian beers -- try some of them.  I've been there 4 times since they opened -- live close by.  The 4-cheese ravioli is amazing, the pizzas--for $10-- are a steal; as mentioned by another -- the mussels are great.  Try the sweet potato gnocchi -- unbelievable, melt in your mouth and for $7 with a big bowl full--a great deal.  Also, tried the housemade ricotta & lemon marmelatta -- wouldn't be my first choice but went with server's suggestion -- it was amazing -- so flavorful, give it a try.  Had the housemade gelatos, which were fantastic and again, a great value.  Overall, you need to go here and treat yourself -- you won't be disappointed -- great atmosphere and style and very good value.  Would give it 6 stars if available.",

I would rather have seen the same attention to detail in the food and the service, but that's just me.   I sat in the downstairs bar and found the waitress to be scarce when my glass was empty and stopping by a couple of times just after she brought the drink, I will say that she seemed new and a little nervous so maybe it's not the norm.   As for the food, I found the carpaccio with the red cabbage to be unique but disappointing. The calamari itself was nothing special although the sauce it was served with was interesting (in a good way).   I am assuming based on the decor this place will have a decent crowd so if I find myself back there I will sit AT the bar and grab a bite elsewhere.",

    "text": "A Vivace Tale... A long, long time ago... there was a date night.... And it went a lil like this...  Well, wasn't the best experience for a restaurant, but the positives...  The waiter was very attentive.  I think I drank about a gallon of water before we got our appetizer, which was the eggplant dip (Perfect)   He also offered a GREAT wine which complimented the meal very well!  I try for a vegan diet, which can be hard if you don't call ahead, so the options here are extremely limited, I got a cheese-less pizza ( a fail-safe at any Italian establishment) and it was more of a tasteless one.  But the company was good :)  If you make a reservation, ask for a table that's separate from the wall or not along the windows.  Awkward Turtle moment when you have to move someones purse to get to your seat on the bench as they managed to cram an extra table in.  If you get stuck at one of those tables, be prepared to have little privacy and be involved in a myriad of conversations that are going on around you.  THEY GET A 4!  So, this is an update to an earlier review, I was contacted by a few of the customer service reps and they insisted we try it again!  So, they get a star for wanting to impress us!  I'm in!  LOL, so I will definitely update this soon!  Vivace is trying for a FIVE star, and I'm looking forward to it!  Once upon a giftcard...  So, thanks to an attentive management staff, we tried Vivace again... SCORE!  It was amazing!  We took the suggestion of wine and was without a doubt, right on point!   The chef prepared a 3 course vegan meal and it was A-Maze-Ing, I got lost in the flavors!  YUM!  The appetizer was a variation of Bruscetta that was made very decadently with butternut squash and flavored with vinaigrette.  Mouth waterin' good! :)  On to the main course, was a great hodge podge of arugula, shrooms, squash, broccoli and many more that I can't remember... Let's just say I got my servings in that day!  The flavor was awesome.  dessert was really done very well as well, with apples and cinnamon in a flaky pizza dough wrap topped with raspberry syrup and powdered sugar!  Welll, hheeelllooooo there!!!  Great job Vivace, we shall return,   And they lived happily ever after!  :-P",

It took our server a while to finally take our drink order and even longer to take our food order. By the time she arrived to take our food order, I politely informed her that I was a vegetarian and to omit any meat from my dishes. I proceeded to order the mushroom/kale omelet and Brussels sprouts. An hour goes by and we still had not rec'd our food. At that point we were starved and asked for some bread.   An hour and a half later, our food arrived however 2 of our guests had left already as they had places to be and did not have time to wait for their food.  As I cut open the kale covered omelet, I did not notice many mushrooms but did notice an odd consistency with the texture. A few bites later, it dawned on me that the 'mushrooms' were in fact pieces of sausage. The omelet was sent back and it was removed off my bill. What's even more upsetting is that the manager could not come to our table to apologize. I can honestly say that this past Sundays poor dining experience will prevent me from dining at Vivace ever again!",

They rotate their risotto seasonally (they do it right) the salmon is always a safe bet.  The short ribs fall off the bone.  The pasta (house made) Bolognese with goat cheese cream is rich and great every time. Love that they offer half portions of pasta as a starter for dinner or as a light bite.",

Nice outdoor seating great for a Sunday morning, but word to the wise, you can't take advantage of their mimosa or Bloody Mary bar until noon.

I would not recommend the American breakfast--sub-par bacon and eggs, though I did enjoy the parmesan polenta.",

We were referred here for dinner but ended up coming for brunch because I had to try the carbonara that was only on the brunch menu (I love pasta!). I initially ordered a Bloody Mary but was hesitant it may be too spicy (which it was for me) but the waiter quickly offered to switch my drink to a mimosa free of charge. The pasta for breakfast was delicious with the poached egg on top -- I even took my leftovers when we were leaving for the airport because I just couldn't let it go to waste. My husband had the strawberry parfait which he really enjoyed and the biscuit and gravy which he also really liked. Overall, cool vibe (we loved the wood panel decor), great service and great food.",

They bring out some bread after you're seated, but I've had better at Macaroni Grill and Maggiano's (at least their breads aren't cold). I ordered a glass of chardonnay and a half a plate of their black linguini, and I will say the sauce was AMAZING. Wish I had some bread leftover to soak it all up! I just wish the portion size was a tad bit bigger, especially at $12.  Ambience-wise, very chic, modern and romantic! Recommend this place for a nice candle-lit dinner. They have a porch with comfortable couches on the second floor with an amazing view of the Charlotte skyline! This place made me wish I had a significant other just so I could get the full experience! haha",

    "text": "We celebrated our first year anniversary of marriage at Vivace, and while the experience was intimate and upscale, the food was just average (albeit creative) and the service wasn't quite where it needed to be for the vibe and presentation. It wasn't necessarily a let down, but we didn't leave blown away.  In terms of ambience and style, I loved what Vivace offers. The restaurant isn't exactly Uptown but the view, particularly from the balcony, is stellar and peaceful. The inside is very modern and a bit romantic. We were given a very sexy corner in the loft upstairs that I adored.  Our waiter was decent. He knew the menu well and had great suggestions, but he was very relaxed and kind of slow. He seemed full of personality but lacked the polish that I like to see on a nice evening out.  The nitty gritty is the food, which counts the most. The chef sent us complimentary seared scallops with a compote of mixed unknown vegetation which was a very nice way to start our meal. Neither of us like scallops anywhere but felt compelled to eat them due to the gesture. For the first time ever, we both enjoyed the scallops. They had an awesome texture and weren't salty/fishy at all.   For the main course, I knew exactly what I wanted. The cider braised pork shank with cherries, cabbage, and some kind of mustard dumpling (but not a dumpling... Like small crispier bread bits). The pork was delicious, though a better shank comes to mind. I was disappointed in both cabbage (thick and red) and the dumpling things (soggy, rather flavorless) and had plenty of room after for dessert which never happens. Hubs ordered spaghetti and meatballs (way to step out of the box!) that he thought tasted like every other spaghetti and meatballs. He thought changing the meat mixture would enhance the dish greatly. I took a bit of the noodles and sauce only and thought it was really good and flavorful!   For dessert we both shared two unbelievably gargantuan scoops of gelato - one being a vanilla with chocolate swirls and the other a seasonal pumpkin. The vanilla/chocolate gelato was milky and unremarkable, the pumpkin was extraordinary and the best part of our entire meal. The latter is possibly the best gelato I've ever had.  Being an Italian restaurant, we were also pleased with the wine menu and enjoyed a recommendation that was special yet didn't go over our budget. This is a nice spot if you're looking for a romantic evening out but are trying to avoid a $50 per head cost.",

The service was exceptional - shout out to our server, Lauren, who took great care of us. She recommended an awesome bottle of prosecco and kept our glasses full the whole night. She was personable and the minute we told her we were celebrating an anniversary, she went out of her way to make sure we had a memorable evening. The food was just as good. We started with the charcuterie and cheese board (we particularly liked the Romano), and Caesar salads with a perfect amount of dressing. For the main course, my husband had the spaghetti and I ordered the parpardelle. Both dishes were fantastic, with clearly freshly-made pasta cooked al dente. I would definitely recommend their marinara sauce, which had just the right amounts of sweetness and spiciness. My husband even raved about the sauce, and he is a stickler about red sauces. At the end of the meal, Lauren offered us complimentary gelato in honor of our anniversary; we chose the Nutella flavor, and it was also spectacular. All in all, a great evening. So glad we took a chance on Vivace!",

    "text": "We finally visited Vivace for the first time this past Saturday night.  As expected, it was beautiful inside the restaurant.  As unexpected, while it isn't supercasual, it's not superdressy or stuffy either.  It was \"just right.\"  Classy, but casual.  We were seated in a corner booth/table.  The lighting/atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant, and the decor is very modern.  To start, we ordered a couple of random Italian wines neither of us had heard of before.  And, yes, I probably pronounced it wrong.  To start, we ordered the calamari fritti and bruschetta with goat cheese, tomato, and broccoli rabe.  The portion of the calamari was very generous.  And while spicy tomato aioli dipping sauce and grilled peppers sprinkled in between the calamari pieces gave the dish a great flavor, the calamari itself didn't have much flavor.  I think the coating needed some spices/flavoring added to it to really perk it up.  The three pieces of bruschetta were delicious, but I didn't taste much of the goat cheese.  I think it could have used more, especially for the price.    Because the portion was so big and we had other food still on its way, we only finished about 2/3 of the calamari.  Our server came by to take it away and we were surprised that he didn't offer to box it up for us, so I spoke up and asked for a to-go box for it.  BTW, we never did see the rest of the calamari again.  Whomp whomp.  I guess it was just as well.  Calamari doesn't necessary reheat very well.  It just seemed odd that our server would just take it away, though, and not ask if we'd like the rest of it wrapped up.  We did pay for it after all.  And the table next to us had two big bags of leftover food that they were taking home.   Next came soup and salad.  My partner ordered their soup of the day, which was a black eyed pea soup, and I ordered the caprese salad.  I'm not a big fan of black eyed peas, but the creamy soup had a good flavor to it.  My salad was fantastic, though.  Different than normal caprese salads consisting of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, and balsamic vinegar, this one had roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, pesto, and balsamic vinegar.  The roasting of the tomatoes (that were served cold) really made a huge difference and gave the dish extra flavor.      We ordered so many pre-meal dishes because we noticed that Vivace offers smaller portions of some of their entree dishes.  That's great for diners who would like to sample a variety of their items, like we did.  So for our mini entrees, my partner tried the Butternut Squash Tortellini and I tried the Scallop Risotto.  The risotto was actually a pumpkin risotto with two good-sized grilled scallops on top.  Both had a delicious flavor to them.  Again, it was \"just enough\" because we had already had several appetizers/tapas.  This was like just one more.    I'd like to come back during the warmer months and try their fabulous patio seating, but I'll make sure not to order too much food that I can't take to-go.",

    "text": "This is my third time and I've yet to be blown away. I'm a vegetarian, and there aren't a ton of options, so maybe the limited menu is my problem.   The cheese plate is nice, with 4 varieties I've never tried before, and all were delicious. The soft creamy cheese and the orange blue cheese were my favorites. Sorry, forgot the names.   The bruschetta is interesting, but not typical at all. The bread is good, and it's layered with honey, apple slices and arugula. It all worked, just wasn't what I was expecting.   From then on, the meal devolved a bit. Two in our party had the scallops, which they thought were good but overpriced for the portion ($28 for 3 scallops). The sauce under the scallops is delicious, maybe some sort of lemon butter. Also the brussels sprouts served with the scallops made me rethink my aversion to them.   There are only 2 vegetarian entrees:  mushroom risotto and pizza. Since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, I've gotten the pizza each time I've been here. I don't ever remember it being as bad as this time though. It's supposed to be thin and crispy. Mine was soggy. Too much cheese (4x too much) and not enough bake time created a soggy mess.  I knew right away it couldn't be great due to the insane amount of cheese piled on, but I asked for it to go back in the oven to try to get the crust a little more done. It came back out looking the same as it did before, although this time it was slightly warmed up. On the plus side, it was removed from my bill without me saying anything, which showed good attention and service.   Desserts: I should've taken the waiter's advice. I waivered between the peach cheesecake and the chocolate pastry but ended up getting both. He warned me that the cheesecake wasn't that great and he was right. I couldn't take more than one bite. It was grainy, not sweet, mushy and flavorless.   The chocolate pastry, however, was nice. Thick crunchy pastry double wrapped around a small amount of dark chocolate filling, topped with peanut butter gelato. Too much for one person, this dessert is perfect for sharing. All 5 of us had 2 or 3 bites each, which was a perfect ending to the meal.",

I was so excited, and had planned a dinner with my friends months ago. Sadly, it was a terrible experience, and I will never go back.   The food was HORRENDOUS. I was SO disappointed by the choices. I had my eyes set on veal with ravioli, only to be told by the waiter that it had prosciutto (ham) in it, and I'm not allowed any pork. I also couldn't have it made without any. Seriously???   I decided to just order ravioli and calamari (I love calamari!). Well, the calamari was tiny, cold, and very peppery. It took about 45-50 mins for the food the be brought out, which would have been okay, had the wait been worth it. The ravioli tasted, I kid you not, just like the frozen stuff I get at the grocery store. It was smothered in thick lumps of mozzarella cheese that got stuck in my throat.    By this point I was just so upset, because I was really looking forward to indulge on my birthday. The waiter told me she would bring some pasta instead. It took another thirty minutes for the pasta to come, and in the mean time my friends had already finished their meals. By this point I had no desire to eat my dinner while my party was finished with theirs and ready to leave.   My appetite was gone, and I just wanted to leave. My birthday dinner, which I thought would be so special, was ruined. Just a little bit of effort on Vivace's part would have made the world of difference.   The menu was scarce, and the only two options are either something with pork, or completely vegetarian. I was very disappointed, and my birthday dinner was ruined.   I will NEVER go back to this place. I'd much rather go somewhere where they put a little more love and care into what they serve to their customers.",

Our food wasn't the greatest. Their bread smelled like it was smoked on the grill and our salad had dirt all over it and it seemed like it wasn't washed. We call the manager and he took the salad away. I hope they can fix their issues and keep their customers happy.",

It's something about Italian food that makes me weak....I just love it.....but this place is just on another level.  Everything is fresh and homemade pasta.......homemade pasta?  Who does that?  Certainly none of the Italian spots I've been to.  All I can say is I hope this place is around for a very long time because I am in food love!  I'll get to the food in a sec, but I was digging the plush dining upstairs and the incredible view of the qc.  They have tables and sofa's outside on both levels so I imagine it gets very lively in the summer.  They start you off with bread and a bean spread that my 4 year old loved(I swear the kid will eat anything:-) The brushetta had a shrimp salad topping instead of the normal tomato mix, and it had a bit of a pepper kick to it, but it was good.  The bolognese and the smoked chicken and spinach agnolotti was some of the best Italian food I ever eaten.....ever!  I mean change your facial expression with every bite good!  Let's keep this place in business......for my own selfish reasons:-)",

Had an early lunch reservation and no one was there at when I arrived- so if you're looking for a quiet business lunch spot this would be a perfect place.

We were told after ordering drinks that we would need to quickly order food in the next 15 minutes as the kitchen was closing. Why allow someone to book a party of that size only to rush them through the dining experience? And why not let them know this when booking? Some people in the party were arriving later and we asked if the time could be extended. We were given until 3:15. The people arrived and tried to order at 3:10 but were made to think that it was such an issue that some guests did not order food. The server was nice enough but this whole experience left a lot to be desired. Plates weren't cleared when the food was finished, a few people were served cold food that was supposed to be hot. Also when we asked for plates towards the end for the cutting of the cake, it took 15 minutes to get any plates or forks. I ended up asking at least 3 different servers. This place has really taken a turn down hill. This was NOT the kind of service I was expecting. I am a little embarrassed that I suggested coming here for the baby sprinkle. My previous experiences here in the years prior were much better but this place has really fallen off.",

I guess brunch was a hit. We took a seat in the bar area and I noticed how beat up the place seemed. The floors looked like they've taken a beating. Scuffed beyond belief and they really looked dirty to me.  We ordered a couple of drinks and my wife noticed the glasses looked off. Like they were dirty or full of soap scum. Yet we powered through. They were ok drinks, not worth what we were charged. As we sat and took in the environment, the speakers in the ceiling had dust hanging from them and overall, things just looked like they needed to be wiped down.  Now for the food...  I started with the meatballs which were tasty and came with a ton of shaved cheese on them. Not bad. My wife had the calamari, and she enjoyed it.   For the entree, I had the veal and I was not taken by the dish. It was fine. My wife had a seafood pasta dish and she said it was light on the seafood and the pasta was over cooked.   Dessert was a huge disappointment. My cheesecake was almost warm, and seemed more like a cheese pudding. Not sure if that's what they were going for.  I don't think we will be back, if you couldn't tell.",

There is a free parking lot that is shared for people and they have free valet. Despite it being a holiday it wasn't busy. Had a reservation,  but still waited 30 minutes to be seated. I mentioned in my online reservation I wanted to sit outside. Well they missed that and acted like it was a big deal to set up When only one party was outside at the time of our arrival. Waitress didn't go over menu or specials she missed brining our water to someone at our table and we had to ask 5 times to get it. It was warm outside and they served water with no ice. The food looks better then it tastes. It's very electric modern style of food. I will likely not return and overall don't recommend. My father and brother in law didn't enjoy the brunch and it was there day. The price we paid was decent. The service was lacking. There are so many great sports in Charlotte try something that will guarantee a great experience. Choose wisely.",

    "text": "Vivace is the first place I've found in Charlotte with a truly \"All you can drink\" bottomless brunch. Coming from DC where that's pretty much every brunch, that's been sorely missed in my life.  Enter Vivace. This place does the bottomless right. I think the deal they have is an individual appetizer, entree, and bottomless mimosas or bloody's for like 30 or $35. Super good deal - especially if you're there to drink.  Vivace looks like a super fancy place when you walk in - and it may very well be - but we were not looking to get too fancy when we went, just to enjoy a nice birthday brunch with some friends.   The menu items on the bottomless deal had a good variety, and after trying a little bit of everyone's I can say there doesn't seem to be a bad bite on the brunch menu. I had the calamari with dipping sauce to start and then the carbonara pasta.  The calamari was served hot and crunchy so that was delicious. The carbonara was solid and what you would expect from an Italian restaurant. I did have to stop drinking my mimosa for a few minutes to fully enjoy my carbonara because of the conflicting tastes, but thats probably on me for ordering a pasta dish and drinking OJ! The fact that they mimosa pours were HUGE allowed me to not get that far behind the group.  If you're looking to feel a little fancy but still get a good bit of booze'ing done with your friends, Vivace could be a really nice option for you. I'll definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "We really wanted to like this place. Sadly, no...  We came during Restaurant Week. Maybe that was the mistake we made, because it quickly became apparent that the restaurant cannot handle a crowd, nor handle being busy.  When we arrived, we were the first to be there when they opened for dinner (5:30pm on a Saturday night). We were seated upstairs, which we thought was nice, and we had our choice of where to sit. Service started off good, but everything quickly went downhill.  Where do I begin ... Firstly, our appetizer was wrong. Let me remind you, they had just opened up, maybe one other table has guests. The waiter says something about how he keyed it in wrong because it is so close to another appetizer. So we waited for the new appetizer to come. Meanwhile, we ate the other appetizer we had ordered. We had wanted to have two to try at the same time, not one after the other (defeats the purpose of \"sampling\").  Okay, so we ordered our main course and eventually it comes. Meanwhile, the restaurant is getting fuller, and the upstairs area is about 2/3 capacity at its peak. While we are waiting for our dishes to get cleared from our table (which took us to nearly pushing them off the edge of the table so the staff would take notice), we see *several* tables having dishes they ordered returned to the kitchen -- either wrong order or not prepared correctly. I have never seen so many full dishes LEAVING the dining area!  Finally, our waiter makes a visit. I don't know, maybe we forgot to turn off our invisible cloaking device. So, we tell him we would like dessert and coffee. He tells us he will make a new pot of coffee. We wait, and wait, and wait. Finally, he appears with coffee and a carafe of coffee to refill ourselves (really?). Both the cup he poured for us, and the carafe of coffee are COLD. Still, he gives us large TABLESPOONS to stir our coffee - not even teaspoons! During the long absences of our MIA waiter (\"missing\"), we see a table next to us having a bill issue. The manager is talking with them and assures them that the restaurant will take care of everything and dinner is \"on the house\".  We FINALLY get our bill. Before the waiter abruptly leaves, I hand him the credit card to pay the bill (who knows when/if I will ever see him again?).  Two-and-a-half hours since our EARLY arrival, we are leaving the restaurant. What a HORRIBLE experience. And Restaurant Week? What a joke. They do not even deserve such an honor for others \"to try\" them. SAVE YOUR MONEY. They cannot handle more than a few tables at a time without screwing up orders. Will definitely not return. Huge disappointment.",

We went for brunch on a Sunday. The woman told us there was only seating outside, even though there was only one table being used inside. Their brunch deal is great! All you can drink mimosas or bloody Mary's with an app and an entree for $30. The coffee was horrible! It tasted like water. I sent it back and she didn't charge me, which was nice. The menu isn't large, but has enough options. Our food was really good. I might try it again. I've heard great things, so I'm wondering if we went on an off day.",

    "text": "Vivace has now surpassed Lumiere as our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  We recently visited them twice for New Year's Eve and January's Restaurant Week, having not been here in almost a year.  I'm not sure why we waited so long to return, but we definitely won't wait that long to return.    Everything was on point.  The New Year's menu was delicious, but I'll focus on Restaurant Week, as we could choose anything on the menu.  We started with the carne and formaggio tray and smoked trout burrata.  My husband really loved his meat and cheese tray, including the pickled veggies.  My burrata was fresh, and the trout was delicious.  The portions were perfect.  For our entrees, my husband had the Zuppa de Pesce, and I had the scallops.  The Zuppa had a rich broth, and was full of seafood.  My scallops were the best preparation of scallops I've EVER had.  They were served with kale and a celery root/truffle puree that was divine.  I'm salivating just thinking of that puree.  There was enough to have some with every scallop bite, and it really added to the flavor of this dish.    For our desserts, my husband had their gelato, and I had the mint chocolate tiramisu.  The gelato was thicker and richer than I've had before, and really good.  We took my tiramisu home, and enjoyed it over the next couple of days.    Service at Vivace is nothing less than stellar.  And we prefer sitting upstairs, where the seating is more intimate, and the views are spectacular.    All in all, you can't go wrong with Vivace!",

I spoke to a hostess THREE TIMES prior to the day of the brunch and even the day of to ensure everything was set to go. No one ever mentioned their \"policy\" of not seating people until all of the party was there.   When I arrived there were 4 of us and we were told we couldn't be seated until \"all or the majority of the party was there\". We said ok and waited for more of my party to get there.   After 6 of us were there I asked if we could be go ahead and be seated. They said no, they could sit us at a 6 top table if we wanted to be seated now, but they would only seat us at a 10 top (the number for the reservation) if all 10 of us were there.   My friend asked why they wouldn't have a table for 10 ready since we made a reservation and the manager let us know their policy. My friend said ok that doesn't make sense but it's your policy. The manager said loudly as she walked away \"I'm sorry you feel that way!\"  At this point 8 people in my party had arrived. The manager went upstairs to get the table ready and when he came back down to get us, my 9th person had arrived. I let him know and he rolled his eyes, sighed and said \"now I have to see if I can get a table for 9 together\". I let him know I didn't understand why this seemed to be a hassle for him since I had a RESERVATION so they should have already had a table RESERVED for 10. He explained that they were running a business and he was trying to accommodate me when in reality he \"could just cancel my reservation\" since we were late. He then began to lecture me about how if I showed up to a doctor appt late I would have my appt cancelled. At that point my friends and I decided to leave and take our business elsewhere.   Also interesting was how another party of white females was allowed to go upstairs to their table and sit down to \"set up\" even though their entire party had not arrived. The manager NEVER apologized to me after having 2 convos with me, yet apologized to my white friend who walked in last and never talked to him. Hmm....",

Maybe I'm dining out and getting lucky with some spots, or maybe I'm just in a general jovial mood.  Whatever it may be, let the good times roll.  First of all, the place has a modern feel, but still very classy.  It's a good balance of a nice solid sit-down first-date restaurant (maybe?) but also a great place to hang out in the bar and patio.    So given all the upside of the patio and bar (and probably the good-looking people that would frequent such a spot)... I came here for Saturday lunch when there wasn't any diners.  What?  I came after a round of golf, in full golf garb, to get a solid meal in--I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the spaghetti.  Simple and classic to really gauge the cooking...if I wasn't completely blasted already for a round of golfing + day-drinking.  It hit the spot and I appreciated the portion size.  It wasn't too much where there's lots of leftover, but at the same time, it wasn't too little that left me wanting more.  Props to portion control.  Service complemented the food well.  One dude in our group doesn't eat meat, and ordered the sea scallops with risotto.  It came with prosciutto and the staff took it back promptly without a tinge of unhappiness.  It's a classy thing to do and was surprised at how well it was handled.  They don't get five stars for this, it's a reason that they have five stars--if that makes sense at all.  I'll gladly be a patron of this restaurant, and hopefully I can make it out here on one of the more popping nights... looks like a good scene...  dmo out.",

Two people in our party ordered the same dish and looked completely different. One with hardly any sauce and quickly throw together.  Steak was over cooked.  Waitstaff- they can only place 8 orders at once and we had 16 people. The food arrived for half our party and we were informed that the other 8 did not get entered and the kitchen had to scramble to get the others out 20 mins later. The manager came to the table to apologize, but only spoke to one person at the end of the table, with a party of 16 you would expect more.",

We got to our table and the server wasn't very interested in us, didn't even mention his name. Service overall was very slow on his part, refilling glasses of water, clearing glasses and dishes from the table etc. I may be a little more harsh because of working in the industry in the past but it's the truth and in a nicer restaurant like us I had expected more. When our food came they placed it in front of us and zipped off. The next time he came back to check on us my meal was finished and it was mediocre. I ordered monkfish with the risotto and another friend at the table ordered the same dish. The presentation was very much half done and my dish was a lot more watery looking then her's. The taste was a 3 out of 5 of the risotto and the fish. The vegetable on top was undercooked and too hard to cut. No manager come by at all during the meal to check on the group. The company I kept was great, the interior of the restaurant is still beautiful but I think overall the caliber of this restaurant has gone down tremendously from when they first opened roughly 6-7 years ago, the first time I was visited. With all the other choices out there these days, I don't believe I will be returning anytime soon.",

Arrived and the restaurant offers complimentary parking, which parking in any city can be a headache and mood killer. Then the host promptly directed me and my girlfriend to a very cozy booth. The decor is so inviting and modern, truly beautiful. Our server, which I sadly forgot her name,  was over the top, she could tell it was our first time dining in this location so she explained the menu and answered all our questions.  The food was simply so good I was speechless:  biscuits and gravy, parmesan toscan potatoes and pappardelle I believe it was called. Mouth still waters as I think about it Definitely would recommend making it a sure stop at Charlotte, I know it will be mine.",

However, they had a lot of pasta.. and dishes like brussel sprouts on the menu for brunch, so if you're looking for pancakes and eggs, this place is NOT the place for you! The $2 mimosas were a steal though.   I ordered the french toast and it was way too sweet for me, it did come with bacon though which balanced it out. The brussel sprouts and potatoes were another great starter, it is big, so if you're sharing w/ a group, this is ideal.",

The area is so nice and easy to find. I will give it 4 stars just because the cost of the drinks. If we were paying a premium price I would definitely be giving 3 stars.   Plusses: Good food (not great), cheap drinks ($2 mimosas and bloody mary's) and a very nice ambience.  Minusses: Very slow service. We had a reservation for 1:00PM and got there at least 5-10 minutes early. We were not seated til about 1:20-1:25. We were told about 5 times that they were just bussing and cleaning the table getting ready to seat us. Unless the people in front of us were the messiest of all times, it definitely should not have taken this long.   Overall: I would definitely come back because of the drinks and some of the food. Service was slow and could definitely be better. Overall it was a good experience that I would recommend for brunch.",

It's a really nice atmosphere & I'm sure the beautiful weather outside made it better.   The place was clean and not annoyingly noisy considering the amount of people that were there. There's an outside area too in case you want to enjoy your meal outdoors.   I ordered calamari as an appetizer & the pane perdu as my main dish. I wanted potatoes as well. They aren't available as a \"side\", so I just ordered the family sized portion of Tuscan potatoes instead. I also ordered a piece of grilled salmon, as well as the $2 mimosas.  The calamari and pane perdu were great. The grilled salmon was perfect. It's pretty difficult to do salmon that isn't \"dry\", but this did not disappoint. The mimosas are worth it; strong and not watered down as you would imagine.   I would say the Tuscan potatoes, to me, weren't family sized. They seemed to be a regular portion to me.",

Vivace has been on the radar for a long time and now was the perfect time to try it.    We had a reservation for 5:15 pm and it's been a moderate but very wet day today in the Carolina's. Not exactly a pleasant drive down from Cornelius with all the construction on I-77, lane shifts and very poorly marked lanes.  We arrived at about 5:05 and left the car with the valet and walked in. Unfortunately for her, they only had one young lady at the hostess station who was checking people in and escorting them to their tables, many of which were upstairs.  I felt bad for her because of the workout she was getting.  We were seated close to our appointed time.  Restaurant is very modern in decor with good use of dark wood high ceiling and interesting accents and lighting.  I believe our server was named Nina and she was excellent.  We started with Sparkling Water which was very good with just the right amount of carbonation and mineral content.  In addition, my wife opted for a French Martini and I went with unsweeten iced tea with a twist of lime.  Both very good.  Being a three course Prix Fixe dinner, the first course was the Primi or Appetizer.  My wife opted for the Meatballs while I went with the Smoked Duck Bruschetta which was needless to say, smoked duck, arugula, tomato, apricot and goat cheese on herbed crostini. That came with a $2 upcharge for the duck.  Second Course or Secondi was a bit more of a challenge because of so many choices.  My wife went with the Veal Saltimbocca which was prosciutto, sage and fontina stuffed veal, ricotta ravioli, crimini mushrooms in a Marsala butter sauce.  Excellent and she ate every bite.  I had the Grilled Lamb Chop medium rare with farro, parsnip puree, broccolini, and an orange fig agrodolce.  Exceptionally well prepared with great  presentation. Very good  For Desert or Dolce, we both went for the Passionfruit Cheesecake with Berry Compote.  All in all a very good dinner and a great place to relax and enjoy.  While the original prix fixe pricing, you are somewhat limited but with the upgrade available, you have a lot more options if you chose to pay a little more and remember, spirits are always extra even with a Prix Fixe Dinner.  Great place for dinner and we ill be back.",

We had a party of 6 and was told that the indoor wait would be an hour. We accepted the option of sitting outside thinking that we would be at least under a covered umbrella to block out the scorching sun. That didn't work out, as we were seated directly under the sun.  Due to the lack of attendance by our server, thankfully the Sun melted our ice to refill our drinks. We ordered mimosas as we enjoy their Sunday mimosa special. The drinks came out in plastic cups....wow.   Everyone around us was drinking out of flutes and wine goblets, but we had a PLASTIC cups.   We were under the assumption that our refills would come back in the flutes at a later time. That never happened! We basically had to beg the waitress to attend to us and refill our drinks and food.   We waited over an hour for our food to come. By the time most of it came it was either incorrect or missing.   The above \"salad\" you see took over an hour to get.   It was a terrible experience and we love this place. I think we will be taking a break from them for a while.",

Which was completely understandable knowing how gorgeous it was outside! We didn't want to wait though, so we sat ourselves in the bar area.  For $30 per person, you get never-ending mimosas (OJ only) and/or bloody marys, 1 Appetizer, and 1 Entree. For our appetizer, we ordered Crispy Brussel Sprouts (without bacon) and Mixed greens salad (without pistachios - I'm allergic). And for my entree, I ordered Penne Vodka (without shrimp - I'm vegetarian). The Brussel Sprouts and Penne Vodka were DELICIOUS. And the fact that they kept our mimosas flowing was the absolute best. Also, their hot sauce collection and spices selection was so large! The hot sauce I chose was 'Blistering Butthole' (LOL). It was really good.  4 stars for not enough veggie options, but I would go to this brunch again in a heartbeat. 100% recommend!",

Be prepared for street parking because the location is on the end of a plaza off of Metropolitan Ave. They have $2 mimosas and bloody Mary's....and that is amazing. I ordered the calamari and shrimp and grits. The calamari was delicious and the spicy tomato relish is amazing. Tip: crush the flash fried basil in the relish for a burst of freshness. The shrimp and grits were delicious..the grits were cooked amazing and the shrimp are large. The waitress was awesome and accommodating. The establishment is really cute and has a lot of outdoor seating. Definitely worth a visit! Even if just for the cheap mimosas/Bloody Marys",

We were there for a party of about 15 for a friends birthday.   I ordered a latte, and the American frittata which came with a side of potatoes. The frittata was good - not out of this world good. The potatoes lacked flavor. When I ordered the latte I originally asked for almond milk (they don't have it) then I asked for skin milk (they don't have it) so I relented and ordered with full fat milk. With peoples food sensitivities these days I was kind of surprised they didn't have a dairy free option.   The menu is a little strange too for brunch. There's a mix of Italian classics like pasta and then there's French toast.   I'm not saying I wouldn't return ... just not dying to go again.",

Joseph was fantastic and completely made our experience.  He knew it was graduation day and went out of his way to note that.   The food was wonderful as well.  The lunch menu is rather limited, but better to have a limited menu and tasteful dishes than a large menu that's just so-so.   The brussel sprouts appetizer with the lemon crema was wonderful.  My mouth is watering just thinking of them.  Calamari was a huge portion and flavorful as well. Entrees and pizzas were enjoyed by all.  Fusilli alla vodka and four cheese ravioli were the favorites, although the four cheese ravioli could have used a little more spinach.  Definitely will return.  Would love to be able to sit outside watching the sunset.",

Today was our final attempt, because the food is pretty good.... however, the service is so unbelievably horrible. Each time, we've waited AT LEAST 20 minutes before a waiter even approaches our table. The only visible efficiency is displayed in how quickly customers are over served and left stumbling out of the bar. This restaurant is slow, loud, unapologetic, and undesirable for anyone who expects to arrive, eat, pay, and leave in less than two hours. Our waitress was hanging all over her assumed boyfriend and never attended to us, so we left. Also, to top it off, as we left, an employee walked in with their DOG and sat it on the counter. I don't know who runs this establishment, but it is time to get your employees in line with basic protocols before you're shut down by the health department.",

Although I've been here for dinner several times in the past, never for brunch...and was happily surprised to find that they offer 2-dollar Mimosas and Bloody Marys on Sundays (up until 2 or 3 pm?)!! I split an order for Calamari, which turned out to be perfectly crispy...and even perfectly spicy! Honestly, it was a struggle not to eat the whole plate of this appetizer by myself. Then their Pappardelle was soooo good, I tried my best not to drink it down...but think I failed. I was even surprised to find that their service was reasonably quick and accommodating, especially for a big group as ours. BTW, I've always loved their modern, city-chic decor (even their funky orange ceiling lights!)...and their wide-open ambiance. Yes, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone...especially so for brunch!",

We sat in the upstairs which was so cozy and romantic. The candlelit tables added a special touch. Our server was prompt and attentive. He also helped us decipher the menu which was in all Italian. We had no idea what most of the words meant but he walked us through it. We ordered a bunch of drinks, two different appetizers, two different entrees, and two desserts. LOL We wanted to splurge for our anniversary, and we did just that. It was worth every single penny we spent. It was so delicious and plenty to eat. Needless to say, we were stuffed when we left. I would definitely recommend to anyone to go here, especially for a date. We will certainly being going back here sometime soon, probably for my birthday!",

They changed up the gnocchi appetizer (the primary reason I go). It's no longer the creamy, zaftig sauce with layers of flavor. I received a bowl of below average gnocchi with a thin, watery, broth that was overwhelmed with the taste of charred asparagus. I got the grilled shrimp and lobster ravioli. Same problem. Thin and tasteless broth with no substance of flavor or texture. The veggies on top seemed boiled and did not complement the dish and felt like an afterthought. My friends got the pork and another had the pan seared grouper. They had the same problem. Just kept describing theirs as \"flat\". The food was really disappointing since I go expecting to get something a little special for my money. I understand it's a seasonal menu and lighter in general, but that doesn't mean leaving out taste! Our sever bent over backwards to help us and she could not have been more accommodating. We asked about our items we ordered and she said they were \"keeping the menu fresh\". Ok, that's cool. But keep food up to the same standard as everything else.",

The scallops were burned & the butternut squash risotto was the equivalent of rice that had been boiled way too long in too much water.  We were with a large party.  The place was completely dead with the exception of our party.  The wait staff was very attentive.  As noted, the waiter kept us laughing which was a welcome distraction from the food.  One of my colleagues had the 4 cheese ravioli.  Her comment was that we could have run to Trader Joe's across the street & gotten better.  Another colleague had the smoked chicken & spinach angiolitti which is supposedly a best seller.  This did not even hit the spot.  The veggie lasagna wasn't anything special.  With the exception of the waiter & the overall ambience, the most important part the food left us with dreams of Trader Joe's having an Italian station.",

The interior was absolutely stunning with large beautiful lighting fixtures in the downstairs dining room and grand wood walls that our server indicated were made from reclaimed wood with different finishes/textures; beautiful! The service rivaled that of any restaurant I've been to in Charlotte.  Our waitress was eager to help, very warm, not overbearing and surprisingly knowledgeable about the wines and menu for their short time being open.  Our group started with the home made ricotta cheese with a lemon marmalade and grilled ciabatta bread which was a hit with everyone.  We also tried the white wine mussels which were served with roasted tomatoes and garlic.  I love mussels and these were prepared perfectly.  We also split a gorgonzola pizza topped with figs and proscuitto which was thin and delicious.  We decided to try pastas for our entrees since they are all made in house.  I had the agnolotti stuffed with chicken in a roasted garlic cream sauce with sundried tomatoes - I have never had a pasta that was so flavorful.  I could tell all the ingredients were fresh in all of our dishes.  One of our group tried the bolognese with goat cheese crema (sp?) that was divine; it took some coercing to get a bite from her!  We let our server choose wine pairings from their wine by the glass menu which is all Italian.  I tried several new wines including an amazing prosecco and a grape called nero d'avala (sp?).  She did a great job of explaining them to me and even brought a taste to make certain I would enjoy it.  We were stuffed so only one friend got dessert, a pumpkin gelato with pie crust sprinkles that was the best gelato I've ever had.  This isn't your typical American-Italian restaurant so go somewhere else if that is what you are looking for.  We will be back many times since we live in Dilworth and Vivace is right down the road.

Our server was Madeline and she did an excellent job explaining the changes to the menu. I ordered a ADD ON portion of scallops. They were $10 and they brought me two scallops. Kinda pricey for 2 scallops. It took 40 minutes to get a cappuccino at the end of our meal. Madeline was great and deducted it. Why punish the server when her restaurant failed her.  I came home and started thinking about those two expensive scallops and decided to call the manager. I phoned the restaurant and ask for manager. The host put me on hold and never returned. So at the 10 minutes of holding Mark - I hung up and phoned back. I ask for the manager again. This time I spoke with a female manager named Wyath. I'm sure I haven't spelled her name correctly. She listened to my concerns. She told me the scallops ADD ON was $6.00 for 2 scallops. I told her I was charged $9 and the menu Says they charge $10. Anyway....a mess.  So ask for specifics because even the manager doesn't know her menu. All in all.........poor response to a customer and loads of excuses.  Next-----------",

His tone was nicer toward white clients whereas the majority of the people in our party were people of color. This is a racist establishment. Please notice the trend amongst the Yelpers.

Our server was very welcoming, chatty and friendly. She answered a few questions, jotted down our picks and not long after we had some stale bread and their white bean spread. It was underwhelming but something to nosh on as we were ready for our apps. I went with their calamari which I felt I got the bottom of the bag. It was more like popcorn calamari. See pic. My husband ordered the Roasted Beet salad which I wish I had gone that route. His had that perfect earthy, zing combination. For our entrees with both went with the Roasted Salmon Filet. We were either starving or it was everything our tastebuds were dying for at that moment. All the flavors were harmonizing together. Not too salty. The portions were just right as well. For dessert, I went with the tiramisu. It was rich and had just the right amount of powerful espresso punch.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Vivace with the dinner group and had a wonderful experience.  First off, I love the atmosphere. The decor features huge orange-ish chandeliers, wooden panels on the wall above the kitchen, wine cabinets on the opposite wall from the front windows and comfortable seating.  They have a nice patio overlooking the Little Sugar Creek Greenway for when it gets warmer and a seating area for just enjoying a glass of wine and conversation.  Instead of having a large menu, Vivace's features a few selections that they do very well.  Our table started out with the meat and cheese plate for an appetizer which I have to say my favorite was the hot sopressata and the gorgonzola.   I also had the Lentil Zuppa which was a savory brothy soup which is a nice change from cream based soups found everywhere else.  The homemade sausage in the soup had a wonderful flavor and texture.  For my main course. I had the Smoked Chicken & Spinach Agnolotti which has some incredible flavors in a very flavorful cream sauce.  My tastebuds were going nuts with this that one of my table mates said I was purring.  This is definitely one of the best entrees I have had in ages.  The dessert menu looked great but I just didn't have the room.  Service from our server, Caroline, was exceptional.   Even though there's a bottle of water left on the table, she was constantly refilling your glasses, clearing off the table, refilling wine and beer glasses.    And they play great music here.  We heard a lot of Thievery Corporation during our meal.",

Some of my favorites are now gone. And specials last night??? We were told there were no specials last night. I think that says it all......There is NOTHING SPECIAL about Vivace anymore. Very Sad!",

    "text": "My wife and I held a small, casual 3 hour wedding reception for 40 guests. The venue itself is a hidden gem; we reserved the private upstairs bar/dining area, which includes a full bar, TV's, bathrooms, a covered patio with walls that also open up into the bar/dining area if weather permits, and patio heaters if needed! The patio and upstairs bar gives you a clear view of the Charlotte skyline; this makes for a great photo background and our guests from out of town loved it. You cannot beat the location, it was then a 5 minute uber to the bars uptown afterwards.  We reserved the upstairs area at beginning of the year and the management made sure the planning was seamless. Over the course of 8 months until the date, we swapped some emails, completed the meal selections (plenty of options and they were flexible) and at the last minute requested they provide the tablecloths and decorations. It was too easy and truly a stress-free process; we arrived that evening 5-10 minutes late but everything was good to go and the drinks were already pouring! The layout and decorations were perfect, we had the ball game on TV, and an incredibly well stocked bar that would please any beer, liquor or wine snob!  Not only was the food, drink and venue amazing, but the staff working also ensured the evening went smoothly - the first hour consisted of cocktails, seating everyone when it was time to serve dinner and anticipating the needs of all 40 guests. The food was incredible, they offer a 4 course meal if you've got the appetite, and it was impressive how they served a group of 40 served all at the same time with such consistency - kudos to the chef and staff! I'll note that we had guests with allergies or vegetarian requests, all of which they accommodated.  The minimum spend for this venue is incredibly competitive, especially when you consider it is a private dining area with it's own bar, bathrooms, patio with a view of the skyline, and amazing food. We had 4 sets of families, including grandparents at the reception and all were impressed with the facility, food and service.   We're really appreciative of staff that worked and made this all possible; to name a few: our servers/bartenders Dana, Madeline and Tripp; and the management who helped us plan the evening: Scott Giegler, Blythe Baird and Joshua Grogan. And the CHEF John Caputo along with his entire team!  When we find another excuse to throw a party we'll definitely be back!",

I had the mussels - YUM and the charcuterie and cheese plate with way too many meats - but it was delish!    If you are avoiding carbs, like me - this is the perfect meal to have at an italian place - just don't use the bread provided with either item and you are good. No pasta, no flatbread, no problem. :)  The salads looked good as did the flatbread though - if you are into that. :)  Take a walk on the greenway, then stop in here for a bite. It is casual enough to feel comfortable in street clothes and later at night, you could be more dressy here.",

    "text": "I used to love this restaurant and was excited to reserve a table for New Year's eve. We ordered sparkling water, as suggested by the server but she returned shortly to tell us that they ran out of the sparkling water. The restaurant planned a special menu for the celebration for $65pp, but the server informed us right away that they ran out of fish. My boyfriend wanted to have fish but we said ok, let's do lamb. The server takes the order and then returns to us and tells us that they ran out of lamb as well.... We were not going to let that spoil our celebration so we ordered whatever was available and waited for the countdown... When I mentioned the countdown to our server, she smirked at us and said \"there is no countdown and the restaurant is closing.\" They closed the restaurant closed at 11:50 pm - 10 minutes before New Year's - turned on all lights, turned off music, started sweeping floors. A couple sitting next to us was also not happy about how the restaurant spoiled the celebration and they turned on music on their phone and we all continued meeting the New Year's and making the best out of the situation. They also told me that they came to this restaurant every year for New Year's celebration and it was never like this, there was always a countdown, music, champagne.... Not sure what happened to the management but this time is was obviously not executed very well. If f this was any night of the year, I would not be so upset but this was our first New Year's together and there will never be another chance to have a first New Year's ever again.",

    "text": "Mama mia! Modern italian in Charlotte has never looked so good and been so easy on the budget.  In the marquee corner of the Metropolitan, this 2 story restaurant/bar has some excellent views of the uptown skyline and a sleek interior that oozes style and modern class.  Luckily,they've got a menu that is equally impressive for just about any palette.  The lower level consists of a large bar area and a medium-sized dining room with a large and impressive glass wine room smack dab in the center of the action.  A large wooden spiral staircase leads up to the second floor, where you'll find another (smaller) bar and more dining space.  In the warmer months, the large glass panes looking out towards the skyline can be opened and pushed back to lead to more lounge-type space for those just in for drinks or looking for a little al fresco dining.  Nice beer selection and an even better Italian wine selection from the bar.  There are also a full list of cocktails available.  I'm not a big fan of the $10 drink, but you can't escape that here.  Beers are about $4-5 and the wines cross just about all budget spectrums.  But all that aside, the food is the real star here.  Nice appetizer selection here that includes a big selection of cheese and charcuterie, which I am a sucker for.  I can't say enough how great it is to be able to pick amongst the different offerings to find a mix that works for you- want all cheese?  Get it.  Want double prosciutto?  Fine.  All come with an amazing chestnut honey and a couple of preserves.  Other apps include flatbreads and calamari but there is a lot more to choose from here.  Fresh warm bread comes on the side along with a white bean dip that could be an appetizer in itself.  For hard-core veggies, the caprese is also a fine selection.  From there, you can move onto a a selection of house-made pasta dishes or main plate features.  There's hanger steak and a number of fish offerings that are worthy of a go.  Everything I have had here is solid good. Whether it was a pasta dish or  For bonus points, I especially appreciate the kitchen turning a shared entree into 2 separate plates.  The wife and I routinely share 1 entree due to portion size bloat.   Each time we have done this at Vivace they have always brought us two plates, with the portions equally divided.  Nice!  We've also tried dessert here and I have found the offerings to all be good, but slight in terms of offerings.  Usually 4 or so choices.  The chocolate cake is smallish in size with a miniature scoop of ice cream.  I'd just go for dessert elsewhere, if needed that badly.  So lots of young and beautiful people frequent the downstairs bar.  It's definitely a see and be seen kinda scene.  Not the kind of place you want to go slum it for the night.  Wear your good stuff and get ready for some really well executed food.  Viva Vivace!",

The bread was enjoyable and the prices were very reasonable. 5/5  The restaurant is bright, airy and modern. I loved the wood paneling and giant oversized orange glass lighting. I really appreciate the beautiful upfit and the bar area overlooking the skyline. The only thing I'd add is tall ceilings often makes the place feel really impersonal.  The highlight of our dining experience was 1) our server who was like an actor in one of Shakespeare's dramas and was so enthusiastic about the food, he upsold us on the dessert. Well thank goodness- the tiramisu saved the whole meal. It had the distinct taste of orange, which I loved. It was light and lovely. (5/5) He also recommended an Italian wine DH loved.  My husband enjoyed the veal with mozzarella ravioli (a lot more than I did) 4/5. The salmon over cauliflower puree left a lot to be desired (2/5). The salmon was fine. It was cooked to the correct temperature. The puree was way more creamy than cauliflowery and I got the sense it was not a healthy alternative to potatoes. It was so creamy it lacked substance which left it flat and me still hungry. Brussel sprouts were below average.  Bottom line: Great spot for lunch or happy hour drinks. I can't wait for the weather to improve to enjoy drinks and tiramisu on the patio!",

I called in for a reservation and after having a lot of trouble at other places they gladly took mine. Not only that but I went in early to drop of a birthday cake and they took care of it, and brought it out at just the right time for us! They made it a good night!  The atmosphere is good too. It's a chic/urban place to have a large (or small) gathering. Very festive looking with the giant orange light fixtures, a large glass case of wine across an entire wall, and a staircase through the center.   The food is also fairly good. I had the Orecciette and I would recommend it to anyone. My friend also got one of their pizzas and that seemed pretty good too.   The only reason I do not give it a full 5 stars is: I didn't like the kitchen being viewable. Just a personal aesthetic choice. Another reason is that my boyfriend thought his dish was okay. Nothing to rave about. And the last reason is one of our waiters (we had two) was a grumpy-gus. While our other waiter was friendly, this one was slightly intimidating. I was reluctant to ask him for anything because he would give me a grumble and stalk away when I asked. He seemed really unhappy to be there.   Overall though. A good place to go. I definitely say try it!!",

If you're seeking a private party space you must check out that second floor.   Service is spot on and are happy to not only describe the dishes, but they go above and beyond detailing the wines on special, where they come from, what the grapes are like, etc. The menu changes up on occasion and I had the pleasure of trying their new-ish chili capellini with crab. While it sounds like an odd combo, it was tasty and light filled with a sizeable portion of pasta, fresh crab, tomatoes, spinach and a dose of fresh crab meat. And it was spicy! It a good way, of course.   For dessert a few girlfriends and I sampled the warm chocolate cake with nutella gelato (WINNER), the apple crostada (with cinammon gelato - delightful) and the mint chocolate chip gelato. Vivace is still one of my faves in the QC. Grazie!",

I really just liked the orange lamps.    I was not a big fan of the menu.  I really did not know what I was ordering.    I just did not get much details from the menu.  I did enjoy my  chili-capellini & lump crab though.  I thought it was delicious with  a little kick of spice.",

    "text": "Here's to my very first Yelp review!  Here goes nothing!  So, I've been in Charlotte for a little over a year now, and with the exception of Villa Antonio, I have yet to find a decent Italian restaurant.  Wanting to celebrate my girlfriends B-Day in style, I made a reservation for two at Vivace / uptown Charlotte.  Not wanting to dine in a 'dead restaurant' I had specifically asked them how busy they tend to be on a weeknight.  The hostess was nice enough to check their reservations and let me know that they had a few large parties and the place turned out to be pleasantly busy for a Wednesday.  The atmosphere was very cool, with music, two bars (one upstairs and one downstairs), and no shortage of lounge seating to enjoy a drink with friends.  One area on the upper deck had VERY nice views of the Charlotte skyline.  I didn't see their drink menu so I can't comment on price, but, it seems a cool place to go even if you aren't necessarily hungry.  But, hungry we were!    As soon as we sat down our waiter dropped a nice bread basket.  Made in-house.  We ordered two appetizers;  Calamari with Spicy tomato aioli and Gnocchi with shrimp, pancetta, corn crema & arugula.  The gnocchi was OUT.OF.CONTROL!  On the other hand, the calamari was perfectly run of the mill, but, at only $10 bucks, it's not going to offend anyone.  If I have to say one thing about the calamari; there's a LOT of it!   My main course was the pan seared pork chop which comes over grilled sausage, ciambotta, parmesan polenta, and fried capers.  This pork chop was a game changer!  Order it how you like, but, medium-rare was how I ordered it.  At first I didn't think I'd be able to finish it, but, I persevered.  My girlfriend needed help finishing her Seared Scallop Risotto with spinach, spicy capicola, & cherry pepper crema.  Me being the gentleman that I am, helped her polish it off.  I'll vouch for the both of us that it was NO JOKE!  The portions were very generous and the presentation was great!    When making my reservation, I just mentioned that it was my girlfriends birthday and without bringing it up again, they brought out a mint chocolate ice cream, on the house.  It was great!  When we were done, we asked our waiter if he could take our picture on their 2nd floor terrace overlooking the city.  He obliged.  All-in-all, GREAT night out!",

The bar is a nice happy hour spot for young professionals. Great patio overlooking the city (and unfortunately a couple of Charlotte's ugliest hotels).",

    "text": "Let me start by expressing the build-up that was my expectation for this restaurant. I have been wanting to try Vivace since it opened its doors to the Charlotte public.   I heard great review after great review so the bar had been set pretty high. I elected to go during restaurant week so I can dip my toes into a few different dishes and not feel like my wallet was getting ambushed.   Overall thoughts? Awesomeness and I will absolutely be back. I had the risotto balls to start and they were heaven in my mouth. Perfectly cooked with a sauce to die for. Loved. I would have had them as my main meal as well if I could.   Then I opted for the steak. Eh. Just alright but definitely not bad. The sauce that came with the dish was finger-licking good but the steak was just a little under-cooked for my liking. My friend got the chicken capellini pasta and I thank my lucky stars she let me try some because holy goodness it was awesome. Unreal actually.  Dessert was perhaps my biggest area for concern because I went for tiramisu. My most favorite dessert of all time and I will judge a restaurant on its food quality based on the tiramisu that they serve. Vivace did not disappoint and actually got an extra star for serving it with a caramel sauce and Espresso gelato. Absolute deliciousness.   My overall thoughts? Get yourself to Vivace. STAT.",

The decor is lush and isn't all glamor and glitz. They have amazing service and also great food to back up that pretty little face.   Braised short rib, fried calamari, shrimp capellini - all fabulous. If you want a little more adventurous, eye opening dining experience ask for a seat in the Chef's corner. Not only will you get to see the masters at work, they might even be as generous as to give you free sampling of some tasty treats.   Now that the secrets been out, make sure you make a reservation! This place gets packed and I can assure you, it isn't all hype!",

    "text": "When you want great Italian in the Uptown area, Vivace is the place to be! Located in Midtown in the new, chic Metropolitan area, Vivace has never disappointed. From the good looking people, to the professional & knowledgeable staff, you will feel the energetic vibe upon entering Vivace no matter what day of the week, but especially on Friday & Saturday.   My favorite meal is the veal saltimbocca with mussels as a starter. Not your traditional saltimbocca as it's more of a Marsala sauce base, but the key ingredients of saltibmocca are there. I always consider and get most of the time the cheese & meat tray. Decide or don't decide for yourself; the staff will surprise you with some great choices that meld well together with some great jams.   Great bar area to mingle with friends or coworkers in the downstairs, and try to take advantage of the patio area that sits along the green-way. My ideal evening is one where I take advantage of the great upstairs area of the restaurant. Sit at the bar upstairs and have some drinks/wine and their famous flatbread (pizza), and finish the night off in the lounge area, sitting outside, enjoying one of the best views in all of Uptown Charlotte.   This is definitely a once/month visit for me. You've gotta check it out!",

For the last round, we had actually forgotten we ordered it! By the time it came we had just been waiting for the waiter to show up so we could get the check and leave. We all happened to order pizzas ($16 each and the cheapest item on the menu) and they were all bad. Under cooked and cold, soggy crust, etc. Didn't have the heart to mention two members of our party were there for their birthdays because we didn't want to continue to wait for something else. Two hours for pizza and beer was simply just too much. Won't be back.",

Although the two times I've been to the bar, it's been a horrible experience. I went one evening for drinks. When I got there, the two bartenders were fighting, and I kept having to wave one of them down to order a drink (I was one of three guests at the bar). The second time I dined at the bar, it was for brunch, because there was a wait for the dining room. My friends and I grabbed a table by the bar, and it was a good 10-15 minutes before anyone greeted us. Again, the bar wasn't full by any means. We kept having to go to the physical bar to reorder drinks because no one was stopping by the table. On one occasion, the bartender told us to order from our server (who was m.i.a.), and when we said our server hadn't been around for a while, he rolled his eyes at us. The worst part was it took 2 hours for two courses to come out. No apologies, no managers. But two hours! By the time the second course came out, I had to box it and leave because I had somewhere else to be. The worst dining experience I've ever had. The dining area seems great, but avoid the bar at all costs.",

Veal was ok and smothered as if to cover up the taste of veal which was accomplished.  After finishing entrees waiter gone for 15 minutes and then brings check without even offering dessert.

Baked more like a thin cake dough. I was okay with that but not impressed that our server did not pick up on the fact, even though I ate everything but the crust.

She also is very understanding with my many needs. The mussels are really awesome and the garlic bread that came along with it was well prep. I enjoyed the mojito drink which was I requested to be more sugary. Their cheese cake is great too. I will definitely come often when I need a good place to relax.

We had an early dinner @ 6:15 so that we could attend the Kirk Whalum concert (nice).  The only drawback was that we were seated near the register used by the wait staff so they tended to congregate in that area.  Check out my photos.",

On the upside, the kitchen really puts out first rate preparations, but not sure about the balance on all dishes.  Lobster Arancini appetizer was woefully weak on lobster.  The Arancini were beautifully prepared, but would have preferred and the sauce was perfectly balanced, but the tiny crumb of lobster was too small to share across two halves of the Arancini when cut in half to eat.    Scallops had good carmelization on one side and the root veggies were perfectly cooked, however the guanciale was neither observed or tasted.  The Salmon was well prepared and a doneness was offered and executed per request.  Unfortunately, the creamed ?cauliflower? under the salmon was literally cold.  Service was ok.  Downside is that we were at a table that backed up to the entrance and we received a fairly cold draft every time the door opened.  A very simple modification to the front entry would eliminate this discomfort; about 3 tables are directly effected.",

    "text": "So hubby and I went to Vivace for date night a couple weeks ago. I've driven by the place several times but this was our first visit. We started with some sangria and calamari. Both were delicious! He had the lamb shank and I had the oysters, both with risotto. Both entrees were very well made and quite juicy but I think we both preferred the lam over the scallops. The only downside was our waiter, who we found to be kind of awkward in his interactions with us. It is also kind of loud because of all the groups and we practically had to shout for the waiter to hear us. Overall, a good dining experience. We will likely return.",

From the start our waiter was extremely rude and checked out.  The tuna crudo with melon was tough and tasteless. The veal was also tough, over seasoned, and basically inedible.  The grouper was swimming in burnt brown butter and the fried gnocchi resembled fried pasta paste and tasted flavorless. This was time ever that we asked for the bill and left the restaurant during the entree course! It was that bad! Vivace is hyped as a trendy, hip Italian but is truly lacking in everything including style.",

The rooftop seating facing uptown Charlotte along with our wonderful waitress made everything awesome. They put a lot of emphasis on the birthday girl which was very much appreciated. We ordered many different items with the group and it all tasted delicious. The Cheese platter- Assortment of cheeses, jams and cured meats everything tasted fresh and was the perfect amount Caprese Salad- Delicious!  Smoked chicken ravioli - a little too smoked for my liking but all in all it was pretty decent Spaghetti - Just had spaghetti and not the meatbals but they cooked it in with red chili flakes to give it a kick and was a huge hit with everyone that tried it",

    "text": "The first time I reviewed was 3/2010...the first time we came and  we Were instant fans. ..great food and service...we've come many times since and have celebrated many occasions here...unfortunately our superb experiences have come to an abrupt halt tonight and the chance of us and bringing friends back is a big fat zero.  First off, before being seated, I went to use the ladies room and slipped on the greasy floor, tweaking my knee.  I then remembered the same thing happened the last time I was there. Why haven't they figured out why the floor is greasy? Yes, I did bring it to their attention.  Our waiter, Stephan, was good..attentive and answered questions. I should have taken heed when he said, the wild boar pasta dish is out of the box and tastes different-  was that code for having no taste? You would think that a pasta dish that had wild boar ragu would taste out of the box and out of this world (which from past experiences is what I expected)...however,  it didn't have much of any flavor. At least some herbs that would bring out an explosion of flavor, but there were none.   The big bomb came with the husband's veal saltimboco. The veal came out and there were two at the table who ordered. Within a few tries at cutting the veal, hubby and guest said this is wrong and way too tough. (now I see this was mentioned in another review) Stephan came over and got the manager, Jason. Hubby said do you know what the cut of veal is in here? No, I don't.  (Wrong answer..remember Hubby grew up in the meat department and knows his cuts of meat) Jason said he would check with the chef. So, they asked what other meal would you like,  which is always a problem  when everyone else has their meal already. The replacement meals were ordered and eventually delivered, after everyone else at the table was done and their plates cleared. Jason,the manager, never came back.  In,the meantime, another manager came to ask how the meal was and we explained that the meals had been sent back. he said he was,sorry and then left. None of the managers ever came back to say what the veal cut was or to follow up and see how the rest of the meal was. As we were leaving, hubby, who was very disappointed,spoke to Jason and inquired why didn't he follow up and why he didn't offer any compensation for the extended wait. Jason's reply was that management says we don't do that, we just replace the meal (and let everyone watch each other eat their meals). Obviously, the managers have no authority to make a decision and who knows where management is.Totally unresponsive and uncaring..not good customer service. There are way too many choices in Charlotte to act as if you are the only game in town.  I've put a lot of thought in to this review. .it's my birthday night and it was my choice to go to Vivace and now I've spent an hour writing this review when I should be enjoying my night,but I just don't want anyone else to be disappointed. I should say the replacement pork chop was very good, but the lack of attention by management was the reason for the 1 star.",

Sides were Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes,  collard greens, green beans and carrot, and stuffing. The collard greens and Brussels sprouts were delicious. Had a few servings of them both. The desserts were pumpkin cheesecake, lemon cake, caramel chocolate cake, apple pie, and fruit. All of that for $35 pre person was a good deal for us since we were visiting. Would visit again to try their regular menu.",

I had company in town the other weekend and decided to give Vivace a try. I am glad we did.   They have a lovely patio with a view of the city, which is perfect for brunch. We made reservations, so we were seated right away.   I loved that they had the Vivace Way- an appetizer, entree, and unlimited mimosas or bloody marys for $25! It is a great deal, and they allow you to switch back and forth between the bloody mary and the mimosa. I figured they would be small portions due to the price, but we all left stuffed! We all shared a little bit of everything, and we were all impressed with our dishes.   Highlights for me were the meatballs, the pork belly hash, and the quiche. Everything was yummy though and I felt as though I got my money's worth.   I will say this seems to be a trend for Vivace reviews, but I would've given this place 5 stars if we had had better service. I hope they start to take the reviews seriously and improve upon this. Our service was mediocre, and if it was better this would've enhanced the experience.",

    "text": "I want to start by saying that we had a great experience and enjoyed the food tremendously. Our server was a bartender named Heather who took good care of us.  I do Uber part time and I'd heard about this place by picking people up from here frequently. I heard great things so I had finally decided to give it a try. Went with my wife for a late lunch. We got there too late for the brunch menu but were still able to try the great mimosas!  The place was packed, so service was a little slow to start. It was almost 15 minutes before we could order. The bartender also offered us bread to start us off, but it never arrived. I don't blame her since I'm sure this is not the fault of service. Not a huge deal.  My wife tries to keep gluten-free so we were thrilled to see they had gluten-free pasta options. I had the pumpkin tortelloni, she had the four-cheese ravioli. We also split the saffron risotto (excellent) and the rosemary potatoes (some of the best I've ever had - treat yourself and get a plate of these for the table).  We enjoyed our drinks and cleaned our plates in a nice, elegant environment. We also enjoyed that it is a fairly quick walk from the streetcar station, giving us a chance to browse around the city before and after our date.  I would absolutely recommend this place to someone looking for a casual atmosphere for a date night or for a business dinner. They had an extensive wine list and the dining room looked very comfortable. Additionally, when it's warmer out, I bet it would be a great place to sit outside as they have a great view of the Charlotte skyline.  Great job, Vivace - would easily go to five stars with a couple of tweaks.",

Everyone at my table ordered the quiche with side salads, so it really doesn't make any sense for it to take so long to cut a slice of egg pie and put greens on a plate.

    "text": "We hadn't visited Vivace in 4 years so we made a reservation during Restaurant week.  When it opened Vivace was a unique offering in Charlotte - delicately assembled pasta dishes, using local ingredients and artisanal practices (like hand rolled pasta). In a sense Vivace was a reaction to the Red Sauce Italian restaurant invasion that occurred about 10 years ago in CLT. I was most interested in finding how Vivace had evolved given the restaurant scene has certainly changed since it opened.  The short answer is it really hasn't, which isn't bad per se. The offerings continue to be very good, well made, and reasonable in size.   We started with a round of cocktails, all excellent - in particular their variation on a Moscow Mule with jalapenos. All the starters looked great, with the Brussel sprouts a standout. I had mussels, which were fresh, spicy and generous in size.  For our mains, the swordfish got rave reviews while my Veal Chop was good, but needed a bit more seasoning to draw the flavors out.   Finally, we had the ricotta cheesecake, which was tremendous.  In summary Vivace has aged well and is now a reliable New Italian option. There are others in Charlotte that are pushing the culinary envelope in more interesting ways, but if you want a consistent experience you could do a lot worse than Vivace.",

Interior decor was beautiful, loved the chandeliers.   My manfriend and I both opted to do brunch \"The Vivace way\" -- $25 for an appetizer, entree and unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. A really good deal if you are going to have at least one drink. I was disappointed that they didn't have the bloody mary/mimosa bar out for Saturday brunch, but will have to come back on a Sunday to try.   Everyone was happy with their meal. I ordered the calamari for an appetizer and thought it was a little bland. My Benedict was good, but they overdid it on the hollandaise a little. The bread and ham they used were so delicious I would have liked to be able to taste them more! Rosemary potatoes were awesome. The shrimp and grits were really good as well. We also enjoyed the drinks. Bloody Marys simple yet delicious and I liked that they had pineapple juice for mimosas.

But that was it and it seemed like I had to haggle with the manager just to get that.( the manager on duty couldn't even make that decision he had to call the GM and ask what to do) While I was talking to the manager he proceeed to tell me he has seen them too. Why would Tell a customer that there a more critters than what they saw? I have worked  in the restaurant industry in the past for 7 years and I have NEVER seen a roach in a restaurant or seen a staff handle the situation that way. I only stayed for the bottomless mimosas Bc I was celebrating my birthday. The dessert was nasty. The server was nice",

    "text": "Bugs  Last night 3 business associates and I dined here. food and service was fine but we had constant visits from unwelcome guests.....spiders to be exact.   One in the bread basket. We brought it to the attention of our server who told the manager. He came over to assure us he checked through the basket saw nothing. We assured him we did. He assured us he did not.  Later, my associate was swatting around his face like he was trying to swat a fly or bee. He said he could've sworn it was part of a spider web that fell into his face.  And later- after discussing the fact that we all were not crazy- we all looked up and there were multiple spiders inside the hanging light fixture. Clearly there was a nest up there. We called over the server who saw it immediately and called for the manager who looked and again claimed he saw nothing. We all were pointing. I shined my iPhone light on the spiders. He said he saw nothing! It was only after I started to get LOUD he- miraculously- saw the spiders.  His comment?: \"Well, that's nature\". Yes, that certainly is nature but I doubt people eating here want bugs falling from the light fixtures into their food. That, I can get on picnic.  Additional compensation? Free Meal? Anything offered by the Manager? No. Nothing. Nada.   So, eat here if you like bugs and a detached involvement from the management. I'm out and won't be back.",

    "text": "Okay so this place was great. Our waitress wasn't from America and I couldn't hear her at all but that's honestly okay because she was so on top of our bottomless mimosas that before my eyes I had a fresh glass in front of me. But as I was writing this review she spilled a mimosa all over our friend Kevin Olsen but it's fine he deserved it don't worry about it. And unfortunately our table neighbors didn't appreciate it when we cheered that \"Olsen got wet\". They clearly don't appreciate anything they won't stop staring at us...but then again I guess they know how to appreciate a good looking group.The food was okay I got fat potatoes on the side of my sandwhich and I wanted fries I mean I think those are the same things so whatever but it was a little disappointing. My friends were jerking off over the short rib hash it was only just fine tho they are dramatic. Overall 8/10 it's a good establishment, mimosas had pulp.....but we've dealt with worse. Had a good time here   So get this- we're back. And they gave us mimosas BEFORE we even SAT.DOWN, ON THEM. We searched for the bottom of the glass the entire time....never found it. I don't understand how some mutants actually like Bloody Mary's but apparently my \"friends\" do. Unfortunately, we made a huge scene. Every time someone raised a glass, we cheered, every time someone sang a song, we banged on the tables, every time someone made a joke, we screamed. It was dramatic. My one friend went to bathroom mid meal and puked bc \"sometimes you need to have a touch of bulimia,\" and my other friend ate protein for the very first time. And as I was writing this my friend put a napkin.....over his face...... and my friend billy poured an entire glass of water on him purposely. I know you may think we're from the south because my friends name is billy, but luckily, we're just tourists. And they just sang happy birthday to my friend who's wearing sunglasses indoors AND his bday is in January :(  Quotes from my friends - \"Should we play flip cup right now?\" .. \"What about musical chairs ?\" .. \"Palmer fuck me up\" .. \"Someone pour one for Jon Benet\"...\" I have a fear of holes\" .. \"here's to Goose, if you can't come in them, come on them, and if you can't come on them, COME OVA\"  Remember, we're in a fine dining restaurant. My chair has a cushion. But, overall, the balls were good, the gahlamad was soft(eh), and the Brussel sprouts had bacon....excellent choice. The meals I think overall went over well. My penne vodka w shrimp was 15 dollars. what.a.fuckin.steal. Also had a lot of Parmesan, another steal. My friend Horacio got a grilled chicken Parm and they fucked it up twice but he said it was delectable when they got it right. We had about 25 bottles of champagne no exaggeration. 26 if you count the one that was poured over my friend Olsen by our waitress last year.  Whateva, cheers mother fuckers",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for the longest but our experience was pretty disappointing. A group of friends and I came for my birthday and some of our party was late to arrive. Our server had an attitude and was snappy because they were closing in hour and he claimed the kitchen was \"on his back about our order because they needed to break the kitchen down.\" If the restaurant closes at 10 why are you breaking down at 9? It was a Tuesday night and only one other party was there besides a few people at the bar. This was upsetting because everyone in our party has worked in the service industry before so we understand the inconvenience of a late party but that doesn't mean poor service. I tried to rectify our lateness by sending the two others the menu so we could give them their order before they arrived. We heard smart remarks from our server and the kitchen. Guest satisfaction should be priority in any restaurant and our experience felt unwelcoming and rushed. Towards the end, Joseph's attitude improved..I'm guessing because we ate quick and asked for our checks which was done to make things easier for him but first impression is everything. And I was quite disappointed. However, the green tea mule, lobster ravioli & calamari were really good! The food and drinks are the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. If this was based on service alone I would give a 2.",

My cusines.. Alfredo sauce with the paperdelle pasta. - Incredible!!   Alfredo sauce mixed with the vodka sauce is also great!  Salad with Romaine, buffalo mozzarella, beets The salads are always crisp and big enough to ask to split with someone.  The Tomato soup is incredible!! I'd skip the cheese blob they put on the top.  Mashed potatoes - delectable! Mmm, Good!!  My friend's cusines.. Halibut with carrots, spinach and risotto - My friend's ultimate favorite. She loved it!! Sword fish- it's my friends new favorite dish!! Salmon with mashed potatoes and cauliflower - Incredible!! So yummy!! My friend loved it! Scallops - only ok, used to be better - too many peppers and risotto.  Yay, back to three scallops. Linguini with clams- my friend wouldn't order it again. She liked the baby clams, but that was it.  Kiana is the best server I've had here. She's really sweet and very good at what she does!! The manager is always great and personable! Always great service and food, worth going back time and time again.",

    "text": "Well...this place was pretty good...not great I'm afraid. Vivace has held a solid spot for awhile at the Metropolitan  My only encounter with the place was at a nicely executed cocktail party years ago, so I decided to take visiting family there.  Service was delayed due to poor timing of seating us to quickly after a giant table. We waited nearly 10 minutes for our server while another woman who brought us water (and claimed that was her only function on the staff that night) chatted to us kindly and politely answered our menu questions before tearing herself away to serve more water (I guess). I kind of think that any place that staffs people just to fill water glasses should be able to better handle taking care of relatively easy tables.  Although most of the food was good, I really wasn't wowed by anything. We had mussels followed by a mixture of specials and menu entrees. The mussels were strong flavored (livery) and briny. I was okay with the intense flavor, but the rest of the table didn't care for them. My wine glass appeared 10 minutes before the wine, served from a small carafe (always thought this was weird- either bring the glass of wine and repeat what I ordered, or serve it right from the bottle!). There were 4 of us, and we got exactly 4 pieces of bread-don't go overboard, guys!  Entrees, all seafood, were very good. Side items and salad were great. The kitchen did well On ambience- Several other large parties were seated and we soon found that the dining room can get so loud you can't hear your fellow diners. (Indoor voices, geez people...) so, another note would be that it's pretty loud on weekend nights. Had service been a little better, the entire experience would have been better. Since the food was good, I will probably give it another try at a later date.",

Two just seems too low, as there was nothing wrong here. I give the service a 10/10 and the food a 6/10. I had my niece, who is 18 months, with me and they went above and beyond to accommodate everything that I asked for. Kudos to the valet and staff.  My waitress said that the scallops with risotto would come with 4 scallops. There were three, which actually would have influenced what I ordered had she been accurate. Additionally, I thought that the dish was a little bitter and lacking in texture and character. Scallops have to be surrounded by something with pizzazz and the risotto simply missed the mark. One of my friends had a pork chop with salad on top. I'm sure that the name is far more fancy and Italian, but that's what it was. It was huge and she enjoyed it, but again said it was nothing to write home about. I'll give this place another try. I've heard the happy hour menu is tasty.",

Now for the reasoning behind 2 stars. The main courses were slightly dreadful. I tasted 4 main courses and 4 apps. 3 out of 8 dishes I enjoyed. Not a single member of our party of 9 finished any dish, except for me and my parfait.  Good ideas on the menu, but they turned out to be bland and slightly odd.

Our event was scheduled to be from 4-6, but the organizer didn't know that the dining room did not open until 5. Nonetheless, we arrived and deposited ourselves at the bar. I do not know the typical traffic at the Vivace bar from 4-5, but to say the service was poor would be an understatement. When I arrived (the second of three people), I was given a menu and nothing else. No greeting, no specials, no initial offer of a drink order opportunity. Eventually the bar tender came back around, took my order and served quickly, but the story was the same for the third of our party upon arriving.  Once our spontaneous cocktail hour was over we were seated in the main dining room. Our waitress came over quickly, explained that they had a new menu, and covered all of our questions. We started off with some delicious Brick Oven Oysters. A sparse portion for sure, but the orange mixed nicely with the lobster and spinach.  All three of us went with the New York Strip (medium rare) for our entrees. Absolutely perfect. The strip was actually pre-cut into about inch slices which saves you half the cutting time. Awesome flavor. The potatoes and broccolini were also amazing compliments to the steak.   The atmosphere was relaxed, although we were obviously there earlier than the typical crowd ( we were out before 7pm). After my first experience, I definitely would like to return and try the Roasted Salmon Filet at some point.",

In the heat of the summer, the cool, modern interior beckons you to enjoy a light meal and a few drinks, while the patio's spectacular Uptown views invite you outside in cooler weather.   I've paid a few visits to Vivace after a long day at the office, and absolutely love their Pappardelle entree, as well as delicious Gnocchi and Lobster Ravioli. For an appetizer, you can't beat either their Calamari or Bruschetta. There's a full bar and some wonderful local craft beers, although none of them are served on tap.   So swing up to Midtown one evening for an outstanding Italian meal in a great setting -- Vivace won't disappoint.",

Our server Everette had a party of six next to our table that he obviously was very concerned about the drunken party than us!  It took forever for our food to come out. The manager came over to ask how was our food and I said I didn't know yet as it took a long time for it to come out. He said it shouldn't have taken that long and he would check back. He never came back!  The worse hour and a half of my life that I will never get back! The best part was the valet parking!  I am a fan of non chain restaurants but I was very disappointed and would not recommend. The service at Maggianos and even Olive Garden is better than Vivace and even the food is better there!!!",

My favorite part your brunch price includes endless....let me say it twice because it sounds so nice...endless mimosas. And they are delicious!   For brunch you chose an appetizer and entree from a pretty large selection.  For my meal I ordered the calamari and the chicken panini. Both dishes were very tasty! Even better both came out from the kitchen hot. I'd absolutely order them again.   Oh and the portions here are pretty large so expect to leave stuffed and have a to-go box! If the brunch is this good...I'm looking forward to trying their dinner menu next time!",

Now, don't get me wrong, they also were completely booked for Valentine's Day evening, however I was told the bar area that had high tops was a first-come-first-serve basis, so my mom, my boyfriend, and I decided to give it a shot.   When we arrived, we were seated immediately in the bar area at a nice and cozy high top. Our server came over and got our drink order, as well as explained their special 4-course Valentine's Day menu for the night. My boyfriend and I decided to go with the special menu, since we agreed to pick different items so we could try multiple dishes.   Course 1: Lamb Chops & Scallops Course 2: Beet Ravioli & Lobster Bisque Course 3: Roasted Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Pesto Sauce                 Grilled Salmon with Risotto and Pomegranate  Course 4: Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse & Tiramisu  I was extremely happy, as was my tummy after this delicious meal! The food just exploded with flavor, and each bite was a party in your mouth. So glad I found Vivace and was able to experience such an amazing Valentine's Day dinner on such short notice.",

For appetizers we had calamari (which was a nice generous portion size) and bruschetta.  I didn't care for the bruschetta.  It was a little different than what I'm used to.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  Just ....different.  :) Def give it a go...you might like it!  We absolutely loved the atmosphere,  and the decor of the place.  We even took pictures of the walls and decor to use as inspiration for our own house!  Loved it!  I would defiantly say this is a place we would return too again.  Great for a mid size group or a romantic evening with your main squeeze.  :-)",

    "text": "As a fan of brunch, I'm always looking for a good solution for my raging Sunday hunger pangs. After church, we decided to swing by Vivace.   On the positive side, they had $2.50 mimosas. Also noteworthy is the bruschetta appetizer. With a chunky pesto, warmed tomatoes and cheese on super crusty bread, it's probably the most well-executed menu item we tried.  There were some down sides, too. The mimosas were constructed en masse in carafes, and weren't cold enough. The Mr ordered a lemoncello that was far too subtle for our taste. It lacked any zing and felt far too heavy for the generous serving size. That was disappointing.   I ordered the Caprese Panino, imagining a crispy edged panini dripping with gooey mozzarella. My stupid American expectations were dashed by a very forgettable sandwich on ciabatta. Cold, sliced mozz. Pesto. Smoked Tomatoes. It was filling but none too impressive. The bread was the biggest component of the sandwich, and I don't think it should have been.  On the side, I made the mistake of ordering the Tuscan Potatoes. The only thing going for these tubers was the flavor. They were HUGE, over-fried and dry. The Mr eventually had to ask for some ketchup to moisten them enough to choke them down. I would have preferred that they were smaller, at the very least.  Service was fine, bathrooms clean, live music on the patio, and apparently the Mr enjoyed his steak and eggs.  Overall, I'd go back, but not for brunch.",

    "text": "After seeing all the rave reviews for Vivace on here I was stoked to check it out, even though I feel like I'm the last person to try it.   The night: A rainy evening that was perfect for warm, filling Italian food. Being a weeknight, the bar was more crowded than the dining room and throughout my time there, only saw three or four other tables.   The drinks:The wine list is sick!! If you can't find vino you like, you are smoking the good stuff since they offer just about everything under the sun. I opted for the red sangria and it was absolute perfection. It wasn't entirely sweet but more tart and in my world, that's perfection. Next time I will be back to try one of their Italian Mojitos (they offer different flavors such as Blackberry, Pineapple, Lime and more)   The food: They first brought us out bread to nibble on while we were waiting for our food. Instead of olive oil or butter, they brought out a cannellini bean dip that reminded me of a lighter, thinner hummus. The menu has a decent sized selection where you can scan then have one thing catch your eye but then you keep looking (so you won't have order remorse) and find another scrumptious sounding dish. I absolutely love that they offer smaller portions on their pasta dishes (pasta is made in house) since there is no such thing as portion control in many restaurants these days. I ordered the small portion of Short Braised Ribs with fettuccine, apples, swiss chard and a few other goodies that I can't remember. When they brought it out, I kinda pointed out they brought me out the wrong dish and our server told me that was the dish I ordered (I blame it on the sangria). The apples resembled mini scallops at first and there wasn't much braised rib to be seen. I was a bit bummed about that but it ended up being a delicious entree with a light, brown sauce.   The service: From working in the restaurant industry and visiting many dining establishments, this is probably in my top 10% tier of best service I've ever had.   The verdict: I liked it alot. I can't say it's my favorite Italian place in Charlotte yet. They offer a more modern spin on Italian cuisine and I guess I'm a more traditional girl (who knew??) but am definitely happy Vivace is here to offer a different take on Italian. I will definitely come back to Vivace though!",

    "text": "It is a good thing I was hungry!!!  First we had Bread and a White Bean Spread (\"complementary\" and needed to be)...  So What if free bread is below average - I never factor bread into my review rating unless I'm having a Sandwich (or Wrap), or I'm at a Bakery buying bread or if the bread is really good!  Though I expected better at Vivace I wasn't real surprised!    Next we had two Pizzas:  Basil and Tomato and a Chicken, Pepper and cured Pork and they brought us extra Basil when we asked!  These Pizzas cooked almost to perfection (close enough) and were very lite (super thin crust, almost perfect texture, little chewy and a little crunchy, a small yet perfectly proportioned amount of cheese and Not a blend or if it was it was very well executed (I hate most blended cheeses) No Sauce which is fine with me I like Pizza \"both\" ways).  Sounds good right???  How about the Taste?  These Pizzas were good, NOT very good, only a little better than average and since Vivace did almost everything right, I would not get them again!  Not because they were bad, only because I can not say they were any better than good, though better than many - Three yelp Stars.  That would make an easy review...Then I ordered \"Soup\"!  If this had been a Spanish Restaurant they would call this Tomato, Cucumber, Olive Oil, Garlic, Chilled \"Soup\" GAZPACHO!!!  It did have an Italian flare to it, beyond being topped with Marscopone Cheese (I do not like Marscapone and I LOVED this Soup).  If I would have dined here and only had this Soup - I would be giving this review 5 yelp stars!  Fantastic for Soup of any kind!!!   The service gets 5 yelp stars easily!!!!!!  From the Hostess finding us the last table (no reservations) Wednesday 7:15 it was packed!  Our server was fantastic and the service team was perfect!  Everyone did a great job!  Then as the \"Soup\" raised the \"stars\" the desserts SANK the ship!!! Doesn't Espresso Cheese Cake sound great?  It was as plain as mud ( no offense to mud ) easily the least tasteful Cheese Cake I've ever had!  Next we had Three \"Gelatos\" more like poor ice cream.  The flavors were:  Sweet corn, Cherry Vanilla and Mint Chocolate Chip, All below average and little flavor - not bad flavor just too little flavor.  While still at our table, we looked on line for another Restaurant to get Dessert after leaving here, I was so disappointed!   The Decor has Potential!  That is my way of saying they made some great decisions (Modern Clean (not Gaudy though I'm fine with Gaud...and the Wine chiller wall,cool) and uuuhhh well I'm not a Designer, though I guess I've been around some...  The Space has a great layout, yet it is not a Museum so unless it is Beautiful or Extremely Unique it does not add much to my dinning experience!  I love eating in a beautiful setting, though I would rather have great food in a \"hole in the wall\"  than have average food in a place that looks good, that still does not \"wow\" me.  The look of an eating establishment has little baring on my rating unless it is really Incredible or real dirty!    Always I want to give the highest yelp star(s) rating possible and say everything good about an experience, so I may return and get what I know is Great (which would only be Soup, so probably NOT) and the Service was Top Notch!!!",

The chocolate flourless cake was ok, way to crumbly.   Not sure if I will return.",

    "text": "I made a reservation for brunch yesterday (Sunday) since my friend from Ireland was in town. It was her birthday and she mentioned that she wanted to sit outside on the patio to celebrate. I notated this when I made the reservation and the hostess said they could accommodate. When we arrived at our scheduled time, they told us that we couldn't sit outside and that they take outside requests but not reservations. This is something completely different than what I was told on the phone. So, we agreed to take a table inside. The host did not seat us until 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation. Our time at the restaurant was a little over 2 hours and all we got were entrees, a few coffees and two mimosas. Never saw a Manager or anyone apologizing for the delays. I get that Sunday brunch is always busy, but when you try and make time for your friends birthday, who's visiting out of town and the experience is this bad, it makes me not want to come back. Normally, I go to Vivace at least once a month because the food is always good. But this time really made me rethink my love for this place.",

    "text": "Vivace was a very stylish place to grab dinner. The service was wonderful, our waiter was sweet and helpful. We told him our budget for wine and he had very helpful suggestions and even served us a bottle typically sold by the glass, not bottle, to satisfy our wants! He gave great suggestions throughout the night and even took our valet ticket down for us so that our car was waiting when we left the restaurant.   We, two girls out for a birthday, started with the cheese and meat plate where you can choose from a list of well-appointed selections. We then had a pizza and two small plates - scallop risotto and pasta bolognese - to share. The pizza's crust was perfect and the toppings were of great quality. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto was creamy. The amount of food was perfect for us to get full and also to sample multiple things.   Only downfall was the noise in the upstairs area. We were seated at a very nice table by the window, but unfortunately, in the center of the room was a ten-person group that were so loud. Like Real Housewives of Charlotte loud. They basically made it impossible to hear anything besides their conversation. Once their food came out, they quieted down. Other than the noise, the place was great!",

The pastas come in small and large portions that are priced fairly - the small is enough for one, the large will fill you up too much so take some home! I've tried many of the pizzas (love them all), the squid ink pasta (absolutely incredible and unique), and the veal (solid). The salads are tasty, as well. The wine and beer lists are varied enough to provide something for various palettes (which is VERY important since every Italian meal should be accompanied by a glass of something boozie)! Bonus points for complimentary valet parking at the worst parking place in all of Charlotte.   See you soon, Vivace!",

I went by at 11am to pick out a table, drop the rose and give instructions for how I would like the table prepared.     EPIC FAIL!    We were sat at the wrong table, the rose was on a table I did not pick, the candle was not lit.   and we were sat against the windows where the sun was in our eyes so then we had to switch seats and place our backs to the windows.   Now a good start but lets move on..     Food was spectacular,   I highly recommend the truffle ravioli. (I almost licked the plate)   The server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable on the food.  I hate that I cant remember his name to give him credit.   ( upstairs july 27th shaved head )  Overall excellent experience except for the fact that I took the effort to come in and pick out a table away from the windows so the sunlight would not be in our eyes and that I gave fairly specific instructions as to how I wanted the rose on the table and candle lit as we sat.      Next time I will have the host repeat the instructions.   --side note-- it was restaurant week, and there were only 4 tables for me to choose from when I showed up at 11am,  I chose the best out of the 4 and a five pm seating time so we could make it to the theater at 730pm.   There were only 6 tables sat by the time we left at 645 700.    My point,  we should have had our pick of the litter for tables.",

It's got 2 floors and an open layout near the heart of Uptown Charlotte. My friend and I shared two dishes: Corzetti and Pappardelle. Both were very delicious, but not worth the price had we not had a coupon. I also ordered a glass of sangria which, unfortunately, has been the most disappointing kind I've had in my life (albeit, I've been to Spain a couple times). I won't be coming back for the sangria, but I will for the food!",

( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FApeSmith.com&s=9f3d6d9f149ac3b56cb4a1754dac18d44bebdc65cb81f3c3b406e799b71a1b2c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ApeSmith.com</a> ) I went with a good friend and we stayed for a couple hours at least. I will give full disclosure and say that I knew our server, Jeff beforehand, but did not know that he would be waiting on us so that was a nice surprise!  We started out with wine, which was suggested by Jeff off of a nice, simple wine menu and then moved on to cheese and charcuterie offered from the appetizer menu. I chose 3 of each for my friend and I and these servings were HUGE! We couldn't finish all of the meats/cheese and were almost full before the entrees were even ordered. Bonus: the appetizer was only $12 which was a steal! Jeff was nice enough to help us choose which ones we would like best too. Thanks Jeff!  We ordered traditional pastas for dinner and barely put a dent in them because we were so full. The pastas were decent but nothing extraordinary. We obviously did not get to the dessert but stayed for a little while longer to chat and finish our wine.  I would say that the best part of this place is being able to sit on the patio when the weather is nice and enjoy the sunset and a spectacular view of the Charlotte skyline. It makes for a very romantic evening. The atmosphere inside is upscale, yet hip and modern. The staff is professional and friendly and it seems to be a place to go after work for drinks or a great date spot. If you sit inside the restaurant, afterwards have a glass of wine upstairs on the patio to take advantage of the view as well as the loungey couches.   I would go again very soon to try some more Italian yum yums!",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Vivace after being in Charlotte for almost three years.  We were a little underwhelmed.  First off the prices and menu are slightly different then the one online.  I'm Italian and cook spaghetti for Sunday dinner every week so I know the cost of homemade spaghetti.  Online the price was $12 dollars which is a healthy price.  At the restaurant it was $17 dollars which I find a bit high when it was about $2 dollars worth of noodles.  There was also lot of pumpkin on the menu, which I find to be more of a fall ingredient then spring.  We did LOVE the white bean spread for the bread.  We had a vegetarian dining with us who ordered the Pumpkin Gnocchi but was given the regular meat version of it and our server never apologized just said she would fix it.  Luckily a manager came over and apologized and brought her another very quickly. We also had reservations but showed up only to wait close to 30 minutes for our table.  The had a big party of younger people who they sat in the direct center of the place creating a very loud, almost yelling atmosphere.  The food quality was really good, just other things overshadowed the actual food.  Not sure we'll be back with other great Italian options here in Charlotte.",

The candle on our table had no wax only a wick and was dirty inside.  Who puts this on a table? Even the aprons worn by the servers looked like they have not been cleaned.  The floor was sticky and looks like it is in need of a refinishing.  OK. That aside.  They were out of the scallops and oysters.  It was only 5:30 so what's the excuse??  Our server looked like she was about to fall asleep.  The pizza was just OK and the beet salad had very few actual beets and was drenched in dressing.  The guy who delivered the appetizers, the bruschetta I have to say was good, just put them on the table and didn't say a word. With all these great restaurants in Charlotte, especially right in that area, go elsewhere, save your money.",

    "text": "I hate to do this but after my experience Sunday, Vivace has definitely dropped from 4 to 2 stars. I came with 2 friend for an early dinner Sunday and I had a Living Social voucher for $40 so figured why not.   Our server was really bad. Not sure if she was just painfully shy or just socially awkward, but either way she just wasn't good. The starters were pretty good, mussels and cheese plate. The accompaniments on the cheese plate though are not good. There was some fruit chutney or something that one of my friends likened to being already chewed and previously digested for us!! Then there was a honey which was okay and I can't recall the 3rd, though I tried a little and instantly regretted it.   For the entree I ordered the fish special, wild striped bass with shrimp, artichokes and mushrooms. There was no starch with the dish so I asked if it was possible to do a side of plain risotto, same as they serve with other dishes, and obviously I'd pay the up-charge. The server tried to offer me the appetizer portion of seafood risotto for $11. Uh no, I just want a small side, plus I already have seafood in my entree. Friends got salmon and osso bucco. Basically only the guy who got the salmon was happy. Me and my friend with the osso bucco were disappointed.   My fish was way too fishy and the osso bucco bite I tried tasted soapy!! I did end up with my plain risotto side and it was fine. I was left wanting more so I decided to try the salted caramel gelato. Meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.   It makes me sad because I have really always been a fan of Vivace. I love the ambiance, the outdoor space is fantastic and more often then not the food is great. So I will not give up hope but I will prob wait a while before stopping back in.",

As the evening wore on, the number of diners decreased and the number of lounge drinkers upstairs increased. The upstairs area (which has a full bar) would be a fantastic space to reserve for a rehearsal dinner or other special event. There is an open patio that has a fantastic view of downtown Charlotte.  The food was pretty good - nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. The service was spectacular - we had a very nice waitress who helped us pick out things to eat and drink. The atmosphere is on the trendy/hip side, but nothing too obnoxious. Lots of seating available for both couples and larger groups.  Overall, I probably wouldn't return here when I visit, but if I lived in town, I might hit it up again with a group of friends. I'd definitely go for a drink on that upstairs patio with the view.",

Be sure to make reservations and then arrive a bit early and have a drink at the upstairs bar. There are doors that open up to a view of Uptown Charlotte when the weather permits, and it's just a gorgeous place to catch up with some friends over great drinks and appetizers. Speaking of food, here are a few of my favorites:  Appetizers: the calamari with spicy tomato aioli is very good, as is the meat & cheese plate. They also bring bread and white bean spread to the table as a starter, which is very good and can be quite filling.  Salad: the seasonal salad is always great as it has homemade dressing, and the caprese salad is a solid choice as the balsamic is very good.  Dinner: the margherita flatbread, smoked chicken and spinach stuffed agnolotti, and the chili-capellini and lump crab are all great choices. The agnolotti is my favorite go-to dish at this restaurant.  Desserts: honestly, the desserts are a bit small and not for sharing (think tea cake size), but are very delicious. You should definitely try the gelato if you have any room left after dinner.  There is valet parking if you can't find a spot in the deck, and a very large patio on the ground floor for sitting outside if you so choose. If you haven't yet, you should try out Vivace; you won't be disappointed!",

We started off with the mussels appetizer and we couldn't get enough. So many mussels!! And the sauce is the kind that you need to soak up every last drop with the bread. Which we did! For my entree, I order the Smoked Chicken and Spinach Stuffed Angolini.. MMMMMmmmmmmmmm (see picture).. It was superb. My wife ordered some shrimp and pasta dish that I didn't try because my face was glued to my plate (See 2nd pic). I wish I went a little slower and enjoyed it more, but that is what the second trip is for. Right? I obviously recommend this restaurant and suggest you put it high on your list of places to try in the area.  Helpful Facts:  * Free valet parking * Great bar are if you have to wait * Huge wine selection if you don't want to byob/byow * Excellent service and knowledgeable staff  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

    "text": "I had a great time here last year and coming back had high expectations. Maybe that's dangerous.  They weren't ready for our 7:45 reservation. I remember this being an issue last year as well. I don't mind having a drink at the bar but I was already pretty hungry. Around 8 the hostess says she has a table for us, but it turns out she was bluffing. Another 5-10 minutes passed before they found us one for real.  I had never seen their upstairs seating before. The view has potential, but that is where the good news ends. The noise was overwhelming. We couldn't hear the waitress, she couldn't hear us, and conversation was impossible. It was dark too, but at least the darkness wasn't painful. I'd like to evaluate the service and the food, but our poor waitress was handicapped by the noise and the lights were so dim that I never really saw my food. I expect both would have been fine under better circumstances.",

They only really had spaghetti and meatballs,  bolognese and ravioli. So if your looking for lasagna, forget it they don't even make it.  Nice atmosphere, beautiful decor, great waiter",

    "text": "The good:  - Gnocchi appetizer, ridiculously tasty  - Meatballs, second only to Bistro La Bon  - Fennel Sausage Carbonara, beautifully balanced dish  - Braised Lamb Shank, best in town.  - Atmosphere, rarely you see this commitment to aesthetics in Charlotte. Big budget finish out translates to stately or big city feel. You're someplace special   The Bad:  - Service was a little indifferent. Felt like I may be wasting his time at first, but got better mid meal.  - Too many banquettes for a large restaurant. Wanted more space to dine in this environment.  - Were rushed at the end of our meal. Didn't let me set the pace at the end, pet peeve of mine.   Highly recommend.  Request a booth. Plan to overeat.",

    "text": "Below is my first rating for Vivace, which  was (if you read it) a not so great one.  After posting that review on Yelp, I was contacted by their GM and they said they were very appreciative of my suggestions, got rid of some of the awkward seating that I mentioned, and wanted suggestions as to some Vegan options that could be added to the menu and asked if my friend BJ S (a fellow yelper) and I would give it a second try.    Last night we went back and the chef prepared some incredible dishes for my Vegan friend - a caramelized butternut squash appetizer followed by an amazingly presented (and apparently very tasty - see BJ S's review) main course for him.  I had a chicken/pasta dish, that same appetizer, some wine, and a vegan friendly apple/dough/raspberry drizzle dessert.    The seats that we mentioned in our first review were removed and the food was really incredible.  It really means a lot to me that a restaurant cares so much about it's service/food/seating that they read the yelp reviews and really take the suggestions by us very seriously.  Kudos and now 5 stars to them!  Definitely check it out if you are nearby!  Previous review:  Barely a 2.5 star rating for me.  The seating was terrible - there were two of us, with a reservation, and when we were seated, we were at a very tiny table, in between two other tables, with the back side of all 3 tables sharing one bench.  It wasn't private in the least!! The woman at the neighboring table had her purse next to me the entire night, it was so close to me people probably thought it was my purse!  Our eggplant appetizer was quite good, but my main meal was just ok - not a whole lot of food for the price either.  My friend ordered a pizza and it was really bland (I had a piece of it, since I was still hungry after my meal).  Our waiter was friendly and quite attentive with the drink and bread refills, so that was about one of the only pluses of the evening.  I don't think I'll be back anytime soon!",
