It seems like things come and go throughout the Ayrsley area so I am have been very happy that this one has stuck around for a few years.  I hope it stays around for a very long time!  My favorite thing happens to be on their lunch menu, which I hate because I never seem to make it there during lunch, but their dinner menu is just as great. If you ever get a chance to try the portabella sandwich it is amazing.   They also have a great selection of local and craft beer.    And the customer service has always been amazing!

A pretty fair selection of micro brews and local brewery offerings and many other libations but I'm a beer guy. Dessert was chocolate peanut butter cake and it was fantastic. Staff was excellent. Nice mature crowd. Great atmosphere, not quiet but not terribly loud either. I watched food go by as I always do, and the scallops looked and smelled fantastic, and the steaks look EPIC. Next time I think a steak is in order.  Edited, Updated: I went back and had the Duck Wings for an app. Fantastic. It comes with choice of sauce but the wings are so delicious They stand on their own. The Jicama slaw that comes with duck wings was very good, it has apple in it as well. One of the best creative slaws I've had. For my entree I had the Surf and Turf.  Pretty good crab cake and a really great tasting steak.   Went back a third time, this time for lunch. Chicken salad sandwich was pretty good. The tomato soup was the BEST I've ever had, by far!!!",

Is it a restaurant with fine wines, brie and mango chutney appetizers and $27 surf and turf, or is it a bar with $5 Whiskey Wednesdays and \"pre-made\" flatbreads?  Unfortunately, it's both, and the two don't gel.  The fella made a wiser decision than me and got the meatloaf, which had an almost smoky, barbecue flavor to it.  The side of Brussels sprouts were solid - a little garlic and lemon provided a nice flavor - but they're generally pretty hard to mess up.  I got the chicken flatbread and asked the waiter to leave off the tomatoes.  He very nicely said he'd see if they could do that since the flatbreads are pre-made.  Um, 'scuse me?  He checked with the kitchen and said they could do it.  Unfortunately, it tasted like it was straight out of a Stouffer's box; the crust was way too thick and doughy, and the toppings were bland.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, Harry's, shame on me.",

Pretty much like all of the restaurants here in Ayrsley. It's rather pricey for what it is and the quality isn't great. The chicken sandwich isn't too bad and normally I would say the sweet potato fries are the best thing about this place, but last week I got  a to go order and brought it back to work. My fries were burnt. I'm not sure what cook looked at that and thought yep that looks tasty.   I have quite a few co-workers who have had issues there as well. At one point I guess it was the assistant manager came up to our office searching for someone who had left there unhappy. He was pushy and annoying and pushed his way into the office. I went into our secure area to find the person asked him to wait and he pushed himself in accosting her. It was very disconcerting and highly unprofessional and really just made me never want to eat there again. However again it's convenient so I ordered from there again. The burnt fries however was kind of the breaking point. They just have no care about their lunch patrons or their lunch quality.   I assume dinner is better or if you are there for \"Sunday Funday\" and drinking. However if you're there for lunch and not drinking well you aren't going to fare well. I'll stick with Portofino's or risk losing my parking space to go elsewhere!!",

The place still looks the same, sort of a classic bar and medium sized bistro style dining area.  My wife has a grilled chicken sandwich while I had the crab cake sandwich. Overall the food was good. My crab cake was served on a brioche bun, topped with an apple cole slaw. The slaw was tangy and added a good bit of zest to the sandwich. The actual crab cake fell a little flat, it has a decent amount of crab but was dense and overworked. The sweet potato fries that came with it were pretty addictive, they had a sort of honey cinnamon crust on each fry.  It was a nice lunch, I plan to go back before a movie and check out the dinner menu.",

Which was weird, i didn't ask for a manager or a comp. Just let him know what i thought which is why i gave them 2 stars. Always address a concern no matter how big or small. I also noticed the gentleman next to me consumed less than half of his large plate and declined to take a bag with him but didn't voice any concern so i did when i thought it was questionable.

    "text": "I decided to try something new for lunch.  I had heard good things about Harry's and decided to give it a try.  I always found the Ayrsley development to be poorly planned for retail space.  Parking is a bear here but at least there is a parking deck within a short walk of Harry's.    I parked myself at the bar which was a bit awkward for seating.  My knees hit the intricate work on the front of the bar so it was a bit uncomfortable.  Also the chair to bar height ratio was a little off.  The lunch menu wasn't large but it had a good selection of small plates, sandwiches and salads.   I was also looking at the beer selection and it looks like they have all craft beers on tap with many of them local.    For lunch, I ordered the fish tacos.  There were 3 of them which were quite messy.  They were decent but the fish was a little tough.  Service was ok.  It wasn't busy and there were 2 people somewhat working the bar.  But yet they only refilled my tea glass when i was ready to leave.  Still this place intrigues me as I looked over their dinner menu, I find myself wanting to return and give them another chance to impress me.",

    "text": "My normal lunch routine has consisted of cheap, fast food contraptions and bowls of Progresso soup. So, a change in food was very much needed. My co-workers mentioned this restaurant a while ago. Today, I decided to feed my culinary curiosity and order lunch for my co-worker (aka my lunch homie) and I. Harry's Grill and Tavern, here we come! Here are some of the items that we ordered :  Mapleleaf Farms Duck Wings w/Bourbon BBQ sauce and Jicama Slaw  1) Initially, the chicken looked a little parched. Last night's chicken? Ummm, I hope not. However, the taste was decent. Portion size was good.   2) The Jicama slaw was an excellent take on slaw. Traditional slaw (cabbage) can sometimes become very boring. However, the Jicama put a nice spin on it. The lunch homie, though, with her traditionalist, non-risk taking tongue, let the slaw fall gently from her mouth. You can't please every palate.    Small Mixed Green Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette and Mac - N - Cheese - Lunch Combo  1) Harry's Mac - N - Cheese was the greatest joy that I experienced during this meal! The consistency and texture was great...not too dry and not loose...just creamy goodness in my belly! The levels of cheesiness was outstanding. And the light sprinkling of panko crumbs provided that last bit of contrast and crunch. The Comfort Food gods have bestowed their blessings on this particular dish.  2) Bought the Small Mixed Green salad to eat for dinner. The portion size definitely small, but it's packed with some good stuff. Can't wait to get my greedy hands on it later this evening!   Harry Old Fashioned Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Fries  1) My lunch homie ordered a Harry's Old Fashion Burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. I snagged a few and they were good. I've ordered sweet potato fries at other establishments and I've always needed additional condiments (i.e. Honey Mustard sauce)  to add some taste. However, we both agreed that these fries were great by themselves. The slight sweetness of vanilla gave the side item a little more depth, while the salt reminds you that it's still a fry.  She was less enthusiastic about her burger, though. I believed she said that she had better times with a BK Whopper. Hey, I'm not a burger connoisseur,  so who am I to judge? The presentation of the burger was well put together. Wasn't sloppy or unappealing. Just your typical pub burger waiting to be consumed.  All items were moderately priced. My tab totaled to 31.12. Our lunch take out order was timely ( ready in 15 minutes) and accurate. Great location and if you're a non-parallel parker such as myself, they have easy access to the restaurant from the parking garage.  I will definitely return to see what Harry's has to offer for dinner and brunch. I must try the Lobster Mac - N - Cheese!!!",

The dinner was really good. Fairly priced and our server was excellent.",

After trudging thru the rail to get to the place we entered and met a hostess and what appeared to be the manager. Asked for a table for 4 and the reaction was we are totally booked. head down back to facebook or whatever they do when not wanting to make eye contact.  Gee I wonder if \"Oh sorry we are all booked up because our food is so good\" Or maybe \"sorry we can seat you in an hour\" nope, nada, nothing.  Maybe they didn't want the walker in the lobby. Who knows enjoyed a great dinner at Portofino right next door.  A successful restaurant is so much more than great food. The food might have garnered more stars but as for the experience not so much!",

I had a large party of 7; 5 adults and 2 kids.  4 out of 5 adults ordered hamburgers. I myself actually ordered the NY strip, it was cooked to order (med rare)..but  it just wasn't very flavorful at all. One of the kids (my son) ordered the alfredo but it was so dry, not creamy at all. It lacked any flavor, so much so that it just tasted like plain noodles. My son and his friend both shared the pizza the other child ordered. I think a little more TLC needs to be put into these dishes to bring them to life. It would be nice if the menu was revamped to add more variety, I just felt like something was missing. My dining experience was nothing to write home about, and I don't think I would return.",

I had the chicken risotto which was delicious (or perhaps I was starving). It had a very homey taste to it and was certainly plentiful.   Staff was cool although my waitress was a tad annoying with the frequency of her checking up on me. Surprisingly despite it being a Saturday evening, the place remained somewhat bare. Perhaps too much to do in Charlotte ;-) The menu is moderate and they offer a variety of wines.  I would certainly visit again and recommend trying this place.  There was parking available on the street, but there is also a structure and a lot behind the restaurant as well.",

The salmon was cooked as ordered and the Brussels sprouts were caramelized and a bit crispy.  My favorite way to prepare them!! YUM!!!

Tempted by the lobster mac and cheese but not enough room since we had some hh appetizer's at Mac's first.   The pimento cheese and the soup are made in house and both really good.    So we decided to repeat this place breaking our own rules of no repeats in Charlotte while there for 2 weeks on business.  Round 2- Fried brie-with apple compote , mango chuntey and balsamic reduction.   This was a 3 for me.  After having an exceptional blacked brie a few days earlier this seemed more like a dessert to me and less impressive.   For our entrees we both got the same meal.  Harry's surf and turf.  can't beat it for 24.00!  And with 2 sides.   Us both being the carb addicts we are we opted for the roast garlic whipped potatoes and spinach polenta cake.   Both get 5s.    I should know by now i can't get a good crab crab in Charlotte except at Del Friscos but it was worth a shot.   it gets a 3.  The steak had a nice flavor and was cooked correctly-rare.  A little tough but for the price i was okay with it.  No dessert.   I just really like the atmosphere in here.",

The eggs was over Cooked with no yolk running. The hash browns is salty. The \"ambiance\" was dead- literally was separated from bar and dinner lounge with about 4 other people in there when we arrived.  We arrived around 230.. Anyways, my mimosa was good at first (bottomless mimosa) after literally two glasses our waitress comes by with a pitcher full of orange juice and filled my cup. I knew for a fact that it was orange juice and not champagne due to the other two patrons in the restaurant that had to send back there glasses. When I called the waitress over to tell her I prefer a mimosa n not orange juice, her face was blushed and said it was mimosa\" she refilled my mimosa and I got my check. Please.. Don't come here for Sunday funday! The place is awkward. No music. the watered down the bottomless mimosas was a joke.",

There was 8 of us and we all squeezed into the one booth provided so we didn't have to split up. Most of us had not seen each other in months, and the guest of honor came from California and we wanted to show her a good time. He came up to us and told us he would prefer if we split up for dinner as all the food would not fit on the table. We told him we did not want to do this and we would play it by ear. He blamed us that our reservation was last minute and that it was hard to accommodate us. Once the food came, sure enough we were able to fit all our food comfortably on the one table in the booth. As we are all managers and work in the customer service field we were appalled at how he treated us. The food was good but he service was not. Will not be back.",

I got the special beef hamburger with bacon (can't get menu to come up online atm so I don't have the exact name), but it was amazing.  You could tell the quality of the meat, and they are more than generous with nice crispy bacon (I hate it when it's soggy!)  The fries are amazing (some you try, and some you try to finish...these definitely fell into want to eat them all category!).  Everything we ordered was good and satisfied 2 kids and 2 adults.  Great bar spot for adults, and separate dining area friendly to kids.  Definitely recommend.",

They have a great selection of beer on tap and were knowledgeable about each one. My wife had the same experience when choosing a wine. They are also very quick to offer a taste of one of the beers or wine to see what you like. On to the food, wow. I did not have very high expectations and the knocked it out of the park. Caprese salad was delicious. Hummus was great though they should either have super fresh pita or warm it up. Crab cakes in the top 5 that I have ever had, my wife says maybe the best she has ever had. Salmon salad came with a big piece of nicely cooked salmon. Trio of sliders was very good. I also had the 5 spice pork with mango salsa, nicely cooked but I did not love the flavor, something tasted off. Great atmosphere and the staff makes up for any deficiency there was in the food.",

Amazing-delicious.  Both husband and daughter had the fillet mignon salad -- melt in your mouth fillet  The prices were really, really reasonable -- fillet salad was $13.  Unfortunately missed most of a slider trio they'd already devoured.  I got a bit of an andouille slider but didn't care for it -- but I'm not a huge fan of andoullie  But then my daughter gave me half her fillet slider, which was too  rare for her.  Score!.  When the crab cake arrived it was so freaking good -- filled with lump crab, topped with some kind of maybe asian slaw, on a -- for lack of a better word -- \"smear\" of wasabi dressing.  I'm picky about my crab cakes -- this probably was the best I've had.  If not, it's one of my top two.  (Other is at The Pharmacy in Southport NC)  If you are in the Charlotte area, run, don't  walk.  It's actually in a new, very large town center kind of condo-retail-entertainment development called Ayrsley, which, at this writing, was mostly vacant, giving it the feel of a studio lot... or a town where something's gone very, very wrong...",

    "text": "Fat G. coming from Ayrsley. Having got off the plane in Charlotte and looking for a place to eat in town, we came across a place that looked nice and different and was actually open Sunday night.  Harry's is a combination bar/restaurant in the town of Ayrsley. Surrounding the area are trees, small office buildings and the highway, along with some local businesses and such. When you go in, there is someone to greet you. Directly in front of you is the bar along with some small seating on the left. On the right are some booths and tables for larger parties.  They have a small menu for food, but a larger menu for drinks and cocktails. I ended up ordering their burger of the day, which came with fries and one other side that I can't remember right now. The burger was big and satisfying and so were the fries, albeit a bit salty.  What surprised me was the cleanliness and the amount of service they gave us. The server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but in light of this review, I would consider it a positive aspect to mention.  I wish I were able to review other food spots in the area, but even considering this was our only place that we went to eat out, it was a good choice. The place is good for watching the game, or hanging out with people.",

I am talking about choices from fried brie with mango chutney & vanilla apples to spinach & goat cheese puff pastries with balsamic & basil tomato for apps to pistachio crusted rack of lamb and two petite filets (blackened & rosemary crusted) for entrees to assorted chocolate truffles and warm caramel & cinnamon apple slices with angel food cake & french vanilla whipped cream for desserts . Mouth watering yet?!  I have to say this was a welcomed change and we loved every bite! Keep a watch out for another and take advantage as its definitely worth it.  Love that you have choices up to four for the entrees alone, which includes a fish dish, of course.   And can I say anymore about the staff - Tiffany,  Drew, Brian, Amanda, and Jessica will totally take care of you.",

You can get it with dipping sauce but it's good on its own. If you do get a sauce I'd recommend thr sweet habenero one. The flatbread was ok. The pita, hummus and dip was ok also. But thr duck... I'd highly recommend it  they also have a wide drink selection. The cocktails were pretty good. Nice and strong, they don't skimp.  The service was quick. It's a nice restaurant slightly on the pricey side but not terribly so.",

I had the scallops and steak entree while my companions ordered steaks. I loved the side dishes- I had risotto (phenomenal!) with asparagus with I believe a bearnaise sauce while the others had Brussel sprouts and fries.  The asparagus and Brussels were delicious.  The scallops were tender, sweet and had a nice sear. My steak was medium rare and I thought a little tough but I'm not complaining. All in all, I appreciated the quiet atmosphere, the waiter was top notch and the food quality was very good. I will come back if I get the chance again.",

So I will keep this review to the \"Tavern\" part of Harry's Grille & Tavern.  We went last Saturday night to take advantage of their $4 craft beer special. The band that was playing was totally on point (I didn't catch the name but they play the first Saturday of every month). They played a lot of covers of mellow 90s songs. They were laughing and joking around with the bartender. The whole set up created a really great vibe.  Our bartender, Nikki, was friendly and made sure to check on us throughout the night. We tried some of their infusions and enjoyed the peach whiskey but not so much the rum infusion. A nearby patron ordered wine and seeing the generous pour I did the same.   Overall it was a fun and laid back bar environment with a local bar ambiance. The prices were great for the craft beers and for the generosity of the wine pour. We don't go out in Ayrsley as often since it is no longer within walking distance but we will return to Harry's next time we are out that way.",

I ordered their Black Label burger. I went back and forth on getting the Mac and cheese as a side, but I decided I'd just focus on the burger this trip.   From the first bite, I knew I would be back. Very tasty, and cooked medium well as I requested. The pretzel bun was a great choice. I did not get to try dessert because I was completely full from the great burger. Maybe next time I'll have the space. Definitely going to return.",

I had the bison meatloaf in which Bison is one of the healthiest and leanest meats to eat especially since it's grassfed. I had it along with the Brussel sprouts and sweet potato fries. The meatloaf was definitely up there with the best meatloafs I have ever eaten. The meat was succulent, very tender and just melts in you mouth and with the infused cheddar cheese and chipotle aioli just has you saying wow. The Brussel sprouts definitely flavorful and the sweet potato fries to die for. Simply an amazing dish and highly recommend it to everyone.",

Overall, it was good but not memorable.   The meatloaf was a bit dry and the burgers were missing the snap of flavor we were expecting from menu description. Made with three kinds of beef, top led with bacon and cheese, we were hoping it would explode with flavor. It did not. The pretzel role was a trendy twist. It was dense but again not very flavorful.   We shared two appetizers, a crab dip which was really average tasting and a rib roast flat bread which was the best thing served that night.   Great local beer selection and terrific service.",

The manager came out in a few minutes later with a complimentary bottle of champaign. We were shocked, but they made a great impression.  We have been back many times since then.

The menu has a variety of items, including crab cakes, steak, pasta, flatbreads and of course, tons of specialty burgers. You can't go wrong with what you pick. There's usually a drink special going on that accompanies the burger of the day.   We enjoy ordering the small plates occasionally, especially the fried brie and pimento cheese! While Harry's looks like your run of the mill bar/tavern from the outside, it will surprise you once you go inside. Recommend sitting in the bar area over the dining area. The staff is friendly and usually very fast with service.",

Even the scrambled eggs that I added as a side were severely cooked and lacked any moisture and thus accounted for a lack of flavor. I also had the Andoullie Sausage and the slicing and grilling of the sausage in pieces further detracted from the dish. The shrimp and grits had flavor but the consistency was too \"loose\". I think more thought and execution needs to be put into both dishes.",

We were greeted by Melody who was laid back and friendly.  She allowed us to take our time to peruse the menu and offered some fantastic suggestions.    They have plenty of interesting beer on tap and she recommended the \"Baby Maker\" IPA.  She then said to follow it up with \"The Problem Solver\" IPA which we both thought was humorous .    We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese which was very rich, cheesy and delicious.  You could taste the different cheese in the pasta.  We also enjoyed the Brussel sprouts which were a little too oily for my liking and then the crab cake which was good.    The ambiance here is nice, dark and relaxing.  The service was excellent.  Definitely would recommend this place if you are in the area.",

The bartenders were nice and very accommodating of what we needed. We just got a hummus dip which came with three dips and that was pretty much all we got as we had dinner just an hour before. This was our last meal of 2017 and it was then filled with just drinking for the rest of the night.  They have a spacious bar and nice facilities. I wish I had more of an appetite as I would have more of their food, as I believe this place was on my list for a long while. Their service and company were great so I will definitely revisit this place and try out the food whenever I'm in the area again.",

Ben said he had met Jason B here at least a dozen times for lunch over the recent year or two as they wrapped their Realtor biz.  I have to admit I was  bit surprised at the style and vibe of the place. It has the feel of a swanky steak or chop house as you enter.   We arrived just a shade after 11am for lunch and the place was near empty. We got a large table in the back to make room for the youngsters.  Kyle was on the ready with menus and water and we had the hummus appetizers with the pita points, wow what a great idea for several people to stare and a great healthy option.  I had the grilled salmon tacos which came with flour tortillas. What  a great meal it was, the salmon has pan seared and blackened and 3 tacos is more than enough for a meal.  James had the crab cakes, Ben had the Tavern Dip & Dora had the Club. Each entree came with a side and the sweet potato fries were very tasty.  We all liked our food and the service was great. By the time we left about an hour later the place was packed.  The do have an outside patio but there is no wait service there, you can take your beverage outside but no food.",

We dropped in on a Saturday while exploring the area, and were seated immediately. It was around 3pm but we were presented with a brunch menu, which was nice. Their brunch runs until 4pm on Sat and Sun. I had to go with the shrimp and grits and it was very good. All of the flavors meshed well and it had a great balance. The amount of food provided was great. The next day, I went back for brunch again and this time ordered the blueberry french toast. This was some of the best french toast I've ever had. The blueberry mixture on top was so great, I really didn't even need syrup. I definitely have to go back and try some of the dinner menu items when I'm in Charlotte again.",

They always recommend great apps to start and they always have daily drink specials!   This is actually a bit more upscale than you think. I would put this more on the higher end of the double dollar sign. $$. I think it's worth it if you are craving a good steak.   I haven't been able to pull away from any other appetizer other than the hummus & pimento cheese dip dip. The hummus is really good!  Another great go-to if you are here to drink and munch are the flatbreads. They are actually more like little pizzas, not flat at all and very good! Very filling because they are doughy. Finally, when I am craving a great burger, this is my go-to. Trust me on this one.",

It was a cross between box powdered *yuck* and seemed cornmealy... not sure if it's a southern style mashed tater but neither me or my bf could eat more than one bite.... the sweet potato fries, Brussels sprouts and lobster macs were amazing though!! Will definitely come back, but will never order mashed potatoes here.  UPDATE: order today was okay, was disappointed with the very tiny portion of asparagus for 4 bucks in comparison to the portions of all other sides ordered. But what I am most upset about were the salads... had two Cobb salads both had nasty lettuce throughout, and even an entire \"butt\" of the romaine stall which took up significant room where there could've been more actual lettuce. Out of both salads only half was edible due to the disgusting lettuce they threw in it. Attaching a picture. Also there was avocado skin in my salad..... it's frustrating getting something that is supposed to be fresh but then having to compost half due to its condition :(",

I am a big fan of risotto especially now that Hell's Kitchen is back on tv.  Overall, our meal was very good taste and presentation.  The decor of Harry's was also good.

The sweet potato fries have a sweeter baked flavor to them, not greasy.

The food is not consistent either. I have gotten soup a few times and one day it's runny the next day it's thick. We have gotten take out a few times as well and just overall the food is average. Nothing special especially due to the price. The only thing I can say I enjoy each time is the pimento cheese plate. Unfortunately is not a go to place for us.",

I've had waits of up to 30-45 mins because they were short-staffed...and then there would be open tables as the line grew behind me, which is frustrating when you are on a limited time frame and starving.   Not sure if they are having trouble hiring reliable servers/kitchen staff, but they've lost my lunch business multiple times to other restaurants in Arysley because I'm not waiting a half hour to eat on my lunch hour.  More than once, I've had very slow service there. Hopefully they are improving front and back of house management to turn this around, because its a great spot.",

Several varieties of burgers are available including a burger of the day.  I have tried several of them and have been blown away each time.  There are a number of local craft beers on draft as well which I really appreciate as a fan of the local beer scene.  This place is truly a great addition to the neighborhood and is highly recommended for anyone who likes high quality food in a comfortable and trendy environment.",

Nice, dark wood and a welcoming interior. It has a little couch/lounge area down the steps away from the bar (but it is still inside). They may get more people there if they had a larger outside patio. The beer and full bar have good selection. Our server made us a Hurricane and she did not use a mix, which I really like. I dont like the fake syrup stuff. It was just rums and juices. Good stuff! I ordered the lobster roll, which had great flavor and a Nova's bakery roll, but too much mayo. Nice place to grab a drink and catch up with friends.",

The piece they served was really small and the crab and spinach it was supposed to be stuffed with were barely noticeable. to make matters worse the fish was not seasoned. My bill for the small portioned trout \"special\" was $33... Shame on me for not asking the price, but really $33 - that is way too much to charge at this restaurant/grille and for a cheap fish such as trout...The waiter was great and deserves to work at someplace better than this.

Then the broad I was with has the chicken salad sangwhich with tasted good as I stole a bite.  Sandwiches are rather big, I had the slightly blackened salmon tacos which were cooked perfectly to my liking.   The sweet potato fries had a hint of vanilla and were delectable.   We also had hicama  slaw for the first time and enjoyed that as well.  The service was great, greeted as soon as we entered the joint and the waitress was great.  We saw a lot of nice dishes coming from the kitchen that looked incredible,  especially the lobster macaroni and cheese, I will be trying it next time.  They give you large portions of food for lunch, good thing I'm retired because there is no way I would be going back to work after a meal line that, nap time.  It looks like it would be a great place to go for a cocktail at night, nice long L - shaped bar.",

The soup was excellent, served very hot and it was a little spicy. The Hamburger was absolutely fantastic, it was served on a buttered pretzel bun. It would be hard to go wrong with this tasty burger so do not hesitate to order it. The fries were crispy and just right. My dinner side kick ordered a salad and crab cake.

Moving on to the important stuff... service was great, the team was attentive and informative. I ordered the blueberry French toast with bacon. When I read croissants for the bread I couldn't pass it up. The others had tomato soup and the grilled cheese, blue labeled burger, steak sandwich and shrimp and grits. Out of the bunch, I was the only one disappointed but I just prefer my French toast crispy and this had a cream cheese spread that I think made the bread a little soggy. But I would order again and just ask for extra crispy bread and the spread on the side. Otherwise, everything else was really good (I sampled lol). And my Harry Belafonte drink went perfectly with my meal. I will be back on those weekends, when making a brunch ending at 2pm is NOT happening!",

    "text": "I've been to Harry's dozens of times for beverages and always enjoy the friendly bartenders, well-mixed drinks, and decent rotating taps. The cheeseboard is also a favorite appetizer that doesn't disappoint. For atmosphere the dark woods and brass, well-dressed staff, and general fit-and-finish of the place contributes to a certain sophisticated appeal. On these items alone Harry's is easily 4-5 stars. However, I have found myself disappointed by the entrees on numerous occasions (and is the reason it has been over a year since I had eaten there). On my return visit last week, I ordered the Filet Au Poivre with an expectation of a peppery, flavorful meal. The steak was a bit rarer than medium as ordered, which is forgivable given the thick cut. But the mushroom sauce atop it was notably lacking in flavor and had none of the expected peppercorn-infused goodness Au Poivre should have, and several mushrooms were leathery. The mashed potatoes were serviceable, but blander than expected. And the orange green beans were simply awful: tough with an unappealing taste. If I had not been there as part of a work meal I would've sent it back for something else. A co-worker ordered the ahi tuna and did not enjoy it either. I'm hoping they can fix whatever is going wrong in the kitchen; it's a great option in the area and I'd like them to succeed.",

The waiting staff aren't dressed uniformly and look unprofessional. Very dimmed lights. The point of the booth was for a 90 year old comfort level. Had the duck which was very chewy and tough and had the worst sauce gave it a terrible taste. The whipped potatoes were very salt. Very plain salmon and the Brussel sprouts were hard and dry. My grandma had the vegetable which wasn't a good pairing with chicken Florentine they were actually greens and and bean with hammocks. A chain restaurant like mariggianos would have been a better choice and I don't like chains. I like supporting individually own restaurants but the menu items are not very unique or tasty. A $180 for a bad Friday experiment.",

Not the usual four cornered stack, instead served on a short sub roll but still with the usual cheese and ham and turkey plus lettuce and tomato and mayo. Quite good and improved with the sweet potato fries.  Service was excellent and the food was very good. It's still a challenge to find but they're in Ayrsley just past the YMCA.

I ordered mine medium, which helped with the soft interior. I wouldn't say the pieces fell apart or melted in my mouth but very solid salmon! The glaze had almost a balsamic taste to me.  The brussel sprouts had a great taste! They were a bit soft and I think that was due to the amount of oil used, there was definitely excess oil. The sweet potato fries were incredible! Cooked perfectly, and the perfect balance of sweet and salty!",

Truly this is a hidden gem you have to try.  The service is well above par. The bartenders, the wait staff, all the way to the hostesses were fantastic at their jobs, excelled at customer service, and truly made you feel like they wanted to share in your wonderful dining experience.

The brioche was super-soft and the apple or pear (can't recall) slaw was a perfect addition to the sandwich.   Priced at $13, it was at the top range for a sandwich or buger- most were $8-12 so pretty standard.  I have heard from other co-workers that it can get slow- so arrive early if you're eating lunch during the work week.",

Sweet potatoes are already sweet, why on earth would you add vanilla?  It was very disconcerting. I'd give this place 4.5 stars at this point.

They have a creative menu with delicious and fun items -- think lobster mac,crab cakes, bison meatloaf, andouille sausage sliders, tapas, lots of salads, steaks and a lot more. Everything I've had is prepared with quality and finesse that is a big step above your typical bar food.  VERY friendly and helpful staff and a comfortable bar atmosphere.   Just a block away from The Hilton Garden Inn makes this place perfect for a business traveler like me.",

Their Black Label Burger(blend of porterhouse, brisket, and short rib, topped with Pravin smoked bacon, sharp cheddar, and served on a toasted bun) is the best hamburger I have ever eaten and I will continue to get this menu item almost every time I eat there.  Great beer selection.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The place is probably one of the cleanest I have seen.  Dining area, bar, and restrooms are always spotless.",

This place is a hidden winner (I'm not big on giving out 5 stars) and here's why:  1st the food is amazing - I haven't eaten anything here I regretted ordering. I always leave full and happy. I struggle to decide what to have because the menu items are all so good.  2nd The wine list is solid.  3rd they have great local beers on tap - and it's a pretty big selection.  4th The price is reasonable - standard bar pricing for above standard everything.  5th The service - by the 2nd or 3rd visit the bartenders know you. They are friendly and attentive. It feels like you just belong here.  I read here that the table service isn't as good - I can't speak for that. I'd recommend the bar/lounge area but thats just me.  Thats it go try it.... if you see me, say hello.",

We never had pimento cheese, and expected it to be warm.  It was chilled, but good.  They must  not stock a lot of Moscato because apparently I drank all they had.  We returned for another round a few nights later craving the fried brie.  We had just had the most amazing blackened brie at BlackFinn and thought this would be the same.  It was more like fried cheese donuts, good, but not amazing. They were still out of moscato, so that was disappointing.  We ordered a meal this time, surf and turf.  The steak was cooked perfectly rare, the crab cake was ok but had a lot of filler.  The steak did not melt in our mouth like Def Frisco's but for $24 it was still good.  We had a lot of fun at Harry's and would definitely go back on our next trip.",

Went here on a Tuesday night for an early dinner (6pm) and found the staff very friendly and attentive.  I actually sat at the bar but did order any drinks, just dinner.  I did however look at the wine list and found around 15 bottles each of whites and reds, primarily California, 3x pricing with most expensive bottle around $45-$50.  Dinner: I tried their Chilled Sesame Noodles small plate, then I had the Seared Salmon encrusted with Panko and Dijon large plate.  The small plate was pretty good.  It came with julienne carrots and zucchini.  The Salmon was good but by the end was too rich as I could also taste plenty of butter.  Honestly, what I liked most were the spinach polenta cakes which came with the Salmon.  Harry, the owner (very friendly guy) came by a few times to check on me and asked me is I was enjoying the meal.  I commented on the how good the polenta cakes were and he told me they made the polenta in-house and fresh daily so it explained why it was so tasty - but this too was a little rich.  I almost dropped the rating down to 3 stars due to how rich the large plate meal was, especially since normally Salmon is typically a healthy meal, bur since the polenta was so darn good and the Salmon overall was also good I just can't penalize them to 3 stars for such a good meal.",

I was kind of surprised they didn't organize the tables in one or two long lines but was broken out in smaller tables. Wasn't too fond of the set up as this caused a segregated feeling.   They had a Preset menu for us. Typical salad choices as the appetizer (choice of mixed greens, Caesar, or soup), followed by the entrees (choice of chicken, salmon, or pork), then desserts (parfait, chocolate chip cheesecake, or brownie and ice cream)  Food was super slow. Non attentive service. It's super hard to flag down a waiter for anything.   Comments from my team- -The Pork chops was over cooked. -Why did they put chocolate chip in the cheese cake? I wanted original.  -chocolate chip cheesecake was disappointing. The Costco cheesecake was better.  -the brownies were delicious. Soft in the middle yet crispy at the top and sides. -the salmon wasn't spicy it all. Was there even any wasabi in that? (A few didn't choose this option for fear it may be too spicy)",

First up, truffle fries...I repeat t r u f f l e  f r i e s! My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Next, was a Caesar salad to split. Then, I enjoyed the tavern sliders as my meal which had a great flavor and set on a pretzel bun. Who doesn't love a pretzel bun!? My friend enjoyed the meatloaf with a side of Brussels sprouts and asparagus. Luckily, since it was my birthday, she was willing to share a piece of the meatloaf with me which, after trying it, I was honored she even let me have a bite-it's THAT good. Even if you're not a meatloaf fan, it's a must have! We ended the night with a delightful brownie sundae (easily my favorite dessert choice) and Harry's hit the home run! So lucky to have a place like this nearby! Great job to the staff and keep up the great work chef! I definitely recommend this place and will be back!",

Kind of an elegant style Tavern with a great selection of food at reasonable prices. My favorites are the fish tacos and the crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries! The fish tacos are made with deliciously pan seared salmon always cooked to perfection and the jicama slaw on the crab cake is a tasty touch on a crab cake that's 80% crab meat and a hint of wasabi for immaculate flavor. I've been 3 times and the staff are always very nice! They also have a great selection of beers and wines! I also heard they have brunch on the weekends even though I haven't been yet. Go try them out next time you're nearby!",

I originally gave Harry's 3 stars but after my recent experience I'm averaging it out and going with a 2.   The first time I ordered the Duck Wings and the Brussel Sprouts. I was pretty unimpressed by the Duck Wings, they were lacking in flavor and I wasn't impressed by any of the dipping sauces. The Brussel Sprouts were amazing, super crispy and you got a large portion. I thought prices were reasonable as well.   The second time was for a Networking Event. I'm hoping it was a fluke, but the food was absolutely awful. The spread consisted of chicken meatballs, mini spring rolls, crab cakes, and plain shrimp. The chicken meatballs were smothered in sauce and had absolutely no taste. The crab cakes were so dry and absolutely flavorless. Seriously, I eat almost anything and I couldn't finish my plate it was so bad.   Service was very friendly both times and they have a great selection of beers and cocktails. But, the food is pretty off-putting. I'd stick to another Ayrsley restaurant if you're in the area.",

We've been to Harry's a couple of times in the last month and have tried a handful of things on the menu, so far nothing has disappointed. Our typical strategy has been order 3-4 small plates and 1 main dish to share.   Some of our favorites are the duck wings, lobster mac and cheese,  the scallops, and the black label burger!!!   It's always nice to see the selection of local beers on the rotating tap also! Sometimes the food can take a while to get to the table, but other than that this place is a solid option for dinner.",

He can also rap, so ask him about his mixtape.    was excited to try the bacon wrapped Ribeye(cooked medium). Ordered a side of Brussels, whipped potatoes (waiter said it was creamy), and asparagus. Along with the  salad with Raspberry vine & Tavern Dip Sliders.    For dessert: The seasonal which was a strawberry  shortcake layered over a  strawberry cheesecake.   The verdict:  Ribeye was a bit dry. Torturous to finish it. Couldn't really taste the bacon wrap.   Brussels WERE ON POINT! I could recommend these for all my friends and their mommas. I'll get them every time for every side. The perfect  balance of crunch and a surprise smack in the taste buds of flavordom. Mashed potatoes were not creamy but great presentation. The asparagus are very skinny, but hey  they are asparagus and tasted fine.   The sliders were AMAZING, I double dipped the au jus. Ahhh maaa zzinnnggg. Wish I got a second order instead of the steak.   The dessert, looked great, but I was disappointed. The top half was an okay shortcake (airy, thick mousse ) but the cheesecake was sad. It didn't have much flavor, but the aftertaste was cheesecake. I didn't taste the cheesecake unless you chew it for a while. Never had cake like that before.  Note to self: order tavern Sliders, Brussels, Brussels, and try the tuxedo cake next time.",

I needed a hot burger, a cold beer and a side of sweet potato fries STAT!  WOW!!!! My blue cheese hamburger and sweet potato fries were spectacular!! I enjoyed a Triple C smoked amber served in a frosty glass while the NE game played on EVERY television. I had asked our server to please switch it to the game.  Go Big Red!  The servers were friendly and attentive. The restaurant was clean, cool and empty!!! The televisions were clear and plentiful.  They had a variety of ales and lagers with some unique brews. They even had OMB on tap! The prices were fair and the food was excellent!!  So where was (is) everybody??  This place should have a line out the door!! I have been back three times since our first visit and have experienced the same level of service. The food continues to be amazing! The place is clean and cool with a cozy ambiance.   My daughter had a big, delicious oriental salad with lots of goodies on it. My husband (the picky eater) had the pesto burger (special) and raved about it for days.  The fries are thick and crispy. The tomatoes slices were huge. Even the pickles were fantastic. Everything just tastes fresh and good. I eat out OFTEN and am hard pressed to give a Yelp review unless a place knocks my socks off!!!  I give Harry's 5 stars because after 4 visits this place has yet to disappoint!!   PS. I was fortunate to experience the Double Decker Pumpkin desert last Saturday. This is Harry's pumpkin cheesecake with (made from scratch) pumpkin cake and cinnamon Mascarpone mousse, then topped with a caramel glaze. This sensational seasonal desert is reason enough to stop by Harry's!!",

    "text": "Harry's continues to impress with friendly service and great food.  It's a little pricey, but worth it.  I feel welcome here.  On my most recent visit it was freezing outside.  What a welcome sight to see Brian's smiling face at the bar, suggesting the perfect wine.  I'm a little old fashioned and also think the bartender's uniforms with dress shirts and suit vests are very classy.  I met a couple of friends at the bar for drinks, then we moved to the dining room for a dinner of small plates.  When we requested a warm table away from the door, the host accommodated immediately with a smile.  We experienced great service throughout the meal, with visits from the server at appropriate times and team service to deliver the food so that we all got our dinners in unison.  Ahhhh....how nice.   The crab cake is solid.  I'm super-fussy about sub-standard cutting-corners fishy crabmeat in the expensive cakes that many restaurants serve, but Harry's has nailed it with a great recipe - with plenty of lump crab!  I had the small plate with Asian pear slaw, which was a nice accompaniment.  A few of us had salads, and the ingredients (including produce in the middle of winter) are high-quality here.  They don't serve their dressing on the side of salads in a flimsy plastic containers with lids, a terrible practice beginning to settle in at even nicer establishments.  One person at our table ordered the lobster mac and cheese, which looked delicious and decadent, and two others enjoyed the night's small plate special, three lamb \"lollipops\" served with brussels sprouts.  What an excellent selection, and impressive gamble on brussels sprouts (which were excellent!).  I certainly hope Harry's keeps it fresh and stays in Ayrsley for a long long time.",

I ate the sirloin flatbread with goat cheese and balsamic reduction and it was amazing! The flavor combo was so unique. The sweet potato French fries were also the best I've ever had. My spinach salad was also good. My drink Carolina on the Beach was excellent. Our boys split a kids pizza and my fries and had plenty to eat.",

There is a traditional dining area, tavern seating with bar height tables, a lounge area with couches and an outdoor patio. They serve up classed up bar favorites. They always have a special of some sort worth trying. I've enjoyed everything that I've tried. For those didn't know, I'm somewhat of a sweet potato fry connoisseur. Harry's serves some killer sweet potato fries. Up there with my faves in Charlotte. Vanilla battered, thin cut and served perfectly crunchy. I'll ask them to go easy on the salt next time, though. Otherwise, I'll be leaving with hypertension!  Their bar serves up some great drinks and the service has always been friendly. They have a brunch menu (served Sat & Sun 11-4)  I'm interested in checking out. Did someone say $10 bottomless mimosas?! Maybe they'll make me a beer-mosa!  Housekeeping notes... Plenty of parking. I've never seen it get that busy, but I'm usually there at off times. A great place to grab a drink before/after a movie!",

    "text": "Very poor quality of cuisine here. We ordered from sunday brunch menu, my husband had the eggs florentine and I had the omelet with creamy grits. Everything was made with very little vision or culinary talent. When they said creamy grits, instead of getting very nice fluffy grits perfectly balance with butter, milk, I got a bowl of soupy grits made with cream. The omelet was extremely greasy and over cooked- to the point it was browned ans crispy. The potato rounds were greasy. My husbands florentine said it sat on a bed of creamed spinach- what came was 3 poached eggs on top of spinach soup with lots of cream. The way they delivered their menu is very different from what Ive experienced elsewhere when it says \"bed of creamed spinach\". The waiter was very lackluster, we arrived when it was totally empty so he should not have been rushed or inattentive, but he was. He never smiled, didn't ask us anything but what we wanted, never offered any insight into the menu. I asked if my order came with a bread, he said no, so I asked what they had for bread and he said only thing they had was english muffin. However, we saw a breakfast sandwich on their menu with croissant, so we knew that was an option which he failed to offer. We asked about it and he said he could offer that as well.  I wont return here mainly for the food- its very amateur. Anyone can make creamy grits if they cook it in the same amount cream to the point its swimming in it. Sad the steele creek area has little brunch options - but I would opt for waffle house over this.",

I have a gluten allergy and ordered the broiled salmon with lemon & thyme, caramelized Brussels sprouts, and parmesan risotto, with a small mixed greens salad. It was excellent!   I was very pleased that the manager took the time to talk to me about how the restaurant prepares 99% of everything in-house and that they are very cautious with food allergies. I learned that some items, although not listed as gluten free on the menu, can be modified to make them safe.   We would have returned to Harry's for the food & atmosphere, even before meeting the manager, but now it feels like a neighborhood place.   I would have given 5 stars if someone had told me prior to ordering that I wasn't limited to the 3 entrees on the menu that were marked as Gluten Free. It would have given me more options.  We look forward to our next dinner @ Harry's!",

Luckily they still use legal US tender down there, so we weren't too far out of our element.  The atmosphere of the place is pretty nice, and it comes across as a 'classy' bar, but the temperature was probably hovering in the range of 40-45 degrees...depending on the wind chill.  We fired some drinks right away and got the Harry Houdini and the Dirty Harry.  Both drinks were tasty, but seemed to be missing a key ingredient....alcohol.  The Dirty Harry was a quality mix of olive juice and olives, but a few sips in I could have really gone for some vodka.  For dinner, we ordered the pimento cheese, which was great.  The pita bread was warm and the jalapeno bacon jam was a nice complement.  We also ordered the Southern Sliders, which provides a decent sampling of 3 different burgers.  All were pretty good.  The beer cheese soup, on the other hand, was pretty tasteless and disappointing.  If I lived around there, I would probably head back to Harry's and grab some beer and maybe a burger, but it's not a place that was memorable or very impressive.  If you want to head there for a drink, make sure to bring a flask or order beer.",

    "text": "Food was delicious. However, a double call gin & soda was $24. I'm not sure where they get off charging $24 for 2oz of Hendricks gin when a bottle is 35-40 dollars. I spoke with a manager and he claimed that there were 6oz of gin in the drink. I can say with absolute certainty that there was not. First off, I would've felt that one drink in the same way I would've felt after 6 shots of 88 proof liquor taken in the course of an hour, which I didn't - not even close. Second, ice takes up about 7-8 ounces of a 16 ounce glass. Meaning, there would've only been room for 2-3 ounces of mixer and the drink would've tasted like almost straight booze, which it did not. Then there's the straight price of it. Even if it was a well (bottom shelf) liquor (and Hendricks most certainly is not) a shot would likely go for around $5. It's not likely they would take a $6 loss per double they poured. That would be an incredible hit to the restaurant's gross profit of an item which normally displaces the lower GP generated from the kitchen. Not wise to lie to a businessperson.   On a positive note, the scallops were cooked perfectly and the brussels sprouts were flavored to a point that allowed the veg to still be tasted, yet complimented well by the simple flavoring of red onion and olive oil. Also, the server was kind, attentive and thoroughly apologetic about the absurd and possibly abusively high price of my one drink, which was 1.5 times the cost of my food. He still earned the just-shy-of-25% tip I left.   Needless to say, I will not likely return to Harry's, unless they rethink their drink price arrogance and figure out why a manager feels it's okay to blatantly lie to customers. Maybe he thought I was stupid or maybe it's because he can tell I'm from the Northeast by my accent.",

The only downside is that the bartender weren't really attentive, which was kind of odd since we were sitting at the bar and I didn't think it seemed all that busy. Regardless though, I'd come back for sure.",

    "text": "Wow. Highly impressed with Harry's. The boy and myself stopped in for dinner this past Sunday night. Started with the cheese plate which is four cheeses selected by the chef for the day, meaning the plate could always change offering something new. The app came with sliced apples, bread, pear jam, grapes and walnuts to pair your cheeses with. All quite tasty! I ordered the steak flatbread which was actually sirloin cooked mid rare (upon my request) and topped with blue cheese crumbles and a vinegarette reduction. The flavors mixed absolutely perfectly and the flatbread was topped with plenty of steak, no skimping here. The boy ordered a burger, noted to be a blend of porterhouse and brisket - also a winner! Tasted amazing and we were both highly pleased.   We topped off our night with two flights of beer - for $5 you pick 4 - 4 ounce samples. Works for me! The atmosphere was also highly noted! They have several lounge areas where red couches could fit in 6 to 9 people and have TVs around it, perfect for a girls' night out and a chill evening with friends. Harry's has one area more secluded - best for a date night or a dinner with family. And they also have an area separated by a half wall, closer to the bar, if you are looking for more of a lively, bar type night.   Loved the set up, the ambiance and especially the food - hate that it took me this long to discover Harry's over in Ayrsley. Already have my eye on the pulled pork bourbon tacos and a cup of the beer cheese soup so we will be returning soon!",

    "text": "Went here last week with some friends/coworkers for dinner out. Their food is really good and hearty. Creamy tomato soup is homemade and delicious, OMG! I had crabcakes and green beans. Unlike many places, you will not be disappointed with the size of your two cakes. Their cakes are more hamburger sized, seasoned well and consist of pure lump crab meat. My coworker had the best hamburger ever, it had three types of meat including bison. I am a bacon burger fan and I must say, it was one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. I would come back just to have that burger. The fried duck wings were also good, almost like small chicken legs. Our server was very attentive.  Only drawback: If you are not familiar with the area, you have to look for the restaurant because it is kind of lost in a strip of businesses and residential buildings. Street parking is available if you can get it. I parked across the street at the movie theater. Interior is not also that large. Good as the food is, I can see the place filling up quickly with a long wait, but I could be wrong.",

I had the spinach salad with grilled salmon. The salad was fresh, the salmon was grilled perfectly with a nice crispy exterior, but moist on the inside and the wine vinegarette was delicious. My friend had the Grown up Grilled Cheese, which she said was really good. The fries had a good crisp on them that didn't whimp out under the ketchup. Other friend also had the Spinach Salad, which she said was fresh and crisp. Waiter service was attentive and good, he answered all of our questions and kept our glasses filled. I don't remember the waiter's name though. I would definitely eat here again when I am in the area.",

    "text": "I'm very underwhelmed by this restaurant. Harry's seemed like it had promise but it just wasnt to my liking.  Price: the food was really overpriced, everything was about 5$ too expensive. The menu: The menu has a very small selection and not much variance. It seemed like they had a few things on the menu that stuck out. The ambiance: Seems really \"date-nightish\". Dim warm yellow pendant lantern lights and candle light. The booths where long and spacious, so you have lots of room, but also high, so you feel like your in your own little spot, not being crowded. The taste: The all important taste test. I am a burger guy for sure, so I ordered the Black Label Burger. The composition was ok... They put the vegetables on the side, so the cheddar cheese sticks to the bun which makes it hard to pull apart. I think the burger may have under-seasoned because it had little flavor other than the bacon and unseasoned beef. They also don't pat the bacon dry before putting it in the burger, and the burger was really juicy, which is a good thing, but it ended up being very greasy and soggy by the end. Nothing was unappetizing or gross, but I think all in all, it may be best to look for something somewhere else.",

It had pesto sauce drizzled in an \"H\" and I thought that was not only a nice touch but also a nice added taste to the soup. What I did not like about the soup was that I found a piece of chicken marrow in the soup. My friend ordered the lobster mac and cheese and unfortunately she found a piece of lobster shell in her food. I had the southern sliders and they all needed some salt and friend had crab dip which also needed some salt due to its blandness. We had a great waiter named Brookes and I enjoyed talking to him and he provided great customer service. I did not have any drinks but there were some interesting concoctions on the menu I wouldn't have minded trying if I hadn't already had a few that night.

Besides that, they do have space for sit down dining as well as a surprisingly adequate bar. It wasn't packed and I don't think it usually is due to its Ayrsley location (not much foot traffic and not easily seen from the main road).  I had the ~$16 burger which pales in comparison to the much pricier options of steak, etc. But for an 'expensive' burger it was well worth the ambience, service, portion size and taste. It is ground with various beef cuts and topped with bacon. Also comes with your choice of side. The veggie risotto was fine, nothing spectacular, but I wouldn't recommend the fried polenta, just bland.  Next time I'll have to try their main staples and adjust the review accordingly.",

Now...the service.  Amy was terrible. She did barely did the minimum of anything that resembled good customer service. She sat down our drinks without a word. I asked her to  change our TV channel from soccer to baseball and she couldn't be bothered. I asked Amy about a drink I had there before but didn't see on the menu. She answered but condescendingly. She was completely disengaged and should work stocking in the back -- something that doesn't involve people contact.    Andrew was great however! Asking how we were doing, how our food was, if we needed anything....which is the minimum for any  server! Compared to Amy he was exemplary and I told him we didn't want Amy anymore, just him.    And to make sure Amy didn't get any share of the 20% tip!  Management should do some training with Amy or just give her a job away from customers.",

The food was scrumptious too! A bit above casual - nice & classy.  Best tip about this place: the parking can be a little tricky, don't worry you're not lost!",

I got a Farmhouse burger and it was very sizable as well as affordable! The fries are delicious as well! If you ever find yourself in the small town of Ayrsley, I would definitely recommend this spot!",

The atmosphere is nice and quiet so you can really talk to your company and enjoy your meal. What a wonderful night!",
