    "text": "We have frequented village tavern in their Greensboro location for years. When we moved to Charlotte we were excited to try their Charlotte location. We took my mother and a father in law to eat on a Friday night while they were in town visiting, along with our two children. It was a short wait to be seated, however, once we were seated it took forever to receive our drinks and even to place our drink order. Once we were able to place our drink orders and received them they were awful, both of our kids drinks tasted like watered down juice. Our bar drinks were horrible and had to be sent back to the bar. Once we then placed our food order it took over an hour to receive our food. We watched as other tables that were sat after us received their food ahead of us. Long story short, our experience was very sub par as was our service. The waitress was over worked and the bar and restaurant were understaffed. When we spoke with the manager she only offered us an excuse of it being a busy night (as if Friday's aren't always busy) and then she offered us a free dessert. No thanks! After such a long wait for food our kids were tired and we were ready to leave. Again, not what we would have expected from Village Tavern.",

    "text": "It's been a long time since I came here for lunch (now that I don't work in SouthPark). It's less packed than I remember, which is good, because parking is always a nightmare here. My friend and I sat outside on the patio, which was nice and quiet (only 1 or 2 other tables out there). Waitress did well in general, given the fact that we're her only table outside.   We were able to get in and out in an hour, more or less, which is a key for any lunch spots on a work day. My half and half (half chicken club and soup) was solid for $8.95. My friend's roast beef rueben (whole sandwich with a side of fries) was pretty big portion for $11.95 (and a big sloppy mess to eat). The fried calamari $9.95 was good, but not sure if it's worth the price.  Crazy thing is I really wanted the trout, that was my favorite lunch dish there for the longest time, but I just cannot see myself spending $18.95 for lunch! The salmon entree was cheaper.    Village Tavern has always been a solid spot in South Park. They still have happy hours specials (4-6). And it's one of the nicest patio space to enjoy a nice day out.",

    "text": "A long time ago I vowed never to come here again after a terrible experience when I first moved here.  For years you heard this advertised on a popular radio show so you assume if so and so promote it all the time it has to be good.  Well my first experience was horrible but again that was over 15 years ago.  So tonight I was in the southpark area and decided to give VT another shot.  After all, everyone deserves a second chance, even if it is 15 years later.  Apparently this was group night as I was seated next to one large group and there was another one at the the other end of the dining room.  The place was loud!! -- a little louder than I'd consider comfortable.  I mean I couldn't even hear my waiter tell me the dinner specials.  Service-wise it was average.  It took a while to take my drink order only to be told that their beer menu changed and what I wanted was no longer available.  Then it took a while for the drink to come out.  The menu was too broad.  There was a little bit of everything and not one real specialty which made it difficult to decide and not one thing really stood out to me so I went with Chicken Colorado which I've had before at various places under various names...Chicken breast with bacon topped with cheese, barbecue sauce, scallions and tomatoes.  It really didn't differ from anyone else's interpretation of it.   The food was decent but again it didn't really stand out.  Service was slightly better than the food but still not worthy of more than a 20% tip.  All an all, this is average.  The place reminded me of an upscale Applebee's and both points are not enough for me to make a 3rd trip.",

    "text": "Went for Mother's Day brunch. Four in our party, cousins came from out of town. Was excited because of the reviews. Ordered Spinach dip, spring rolls and crab cake for starters. Spinach dip was tasteless with hard stale tasting chips. Sent back and got another spring roll which took too long but we enjoyed. Our food was served to three of us as we were informed as the food was arriving that they were out of waffle/French toast batter.  Completely unacceptable.  We should have been notified before the meals were served. It was Mother's Day Sunday Brunch and it was not busy. Not sure how they ran out of such an important ingredient. The person's food that was left out had a four hour drive back to Atlanta following brunch so her meal was ruined because her reorder did not come until we were just about ready to go. The others meals were less than desirable as well. My daughters crab benedict came with well done boiled eggs on top, my cousins blacked chicken alfredo  was bland with runny alfredo sauce, and my nuevos rancharos was just blah with canned black beans. The manager was very kind and understood our frustration and took care of the bill. He sent us their famous butter cake which was fine; however it did not make up for a ruined Mother's Day dining experience.  I felt doubly bad since I suggested the Village Tavern and it was terrible.",

I ordered an omelet, which I couldn't wait to try.  Well, let me rephrase that...I could, and I did wait.  It took around 35-40 minutes to get the food for our table.  Most disappointing was the fact that we never even got an apology for the food taking so long.    With that being said, once we got the food it was actually pretty good.  Although I was so hungry that it didn't have to be that great to scarf it down.  Another positive was that the prices were very reasonable.  I will probably try it again and hope to have a better experience, but it will have to be on a day that I can eat a snack before I go...",

The service here has always been hit or miss... sometimes it's been really good and at other times it's been pretty dreadfful.  Over the years, I have had some really good meals here and other times, not so memorable.   However, I do find the Tavern to be a nice option when you have a group of people because generally everyone can find something on the menu...everything from salads, burgers, pasta, pizza, fish entrees, meat, etc.  They do have one of the best patios in town for when the weather is nice.  From time to time, they will have a band out on the patio which is cool.   As for appetizers, some of my favs here are the house-made fries, crab dip and Ahi Tuna Sashimi.",

The restaurant has not changed much (it still offers outdoor seating which is stellar in warmer months, or under the tent with heaters in cold months).    To be honest, VT is the type of restaurant I want to give three stars tops, but I just can't.  I am a big ambiance person, and it is just very chainy looking on the inside.  All that aside, the food, in my opinion, has gotten better over the last couple of years.  I have found myself requesting to go here over some of the newer trendier restaurants.  The new bacon wrapped scallop appetizer was outstanding, as well as the crab dip (hard to mess up in my book).  I have to agree with Giannabrie, the zucchini squash with marinara dish is freaking fantastic. So much flavor. You don't miss the noodles at all. It's a full feeling that you can feel good about!  VT also always has good drink specials.  I am a fan of the half-priced wines by the glass on Wednesdays.    The food is consistent, good prices, and nice portions for your money.",

It came topped with a very tasty grave with bacon and mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious and was a nice portion size.   My husband had the grilled meatloaf which was an unusual choice for him eating meatloaf at a restaurant. It turned out to be very good! He also had the spinach as the side it was yummy with a hit a salt for flavor very good. It to was a nice size portion.  We will definitely be going back.

I expected it to be on par with say Applebees but it's more on par with Firebirds.    The macaroni and cheese is to die for... although the past two times we've gone it's been really overly greasy. The mashed potatoes and green beans are probably my favorite sides as I think they are very well done. The prime rib I had was delicious and I've had a regular steak there too that was awesome.  My friend really likes the Cowboy chicken!!    So basically I've never eaten anything bad here. The ambiance is kind of like a chain trying to be classier which is perfectly okay. The booths are comfortable and the lighting is fairly dark but not so dark you can't see anything (because they have windows for natural light). Their outside patio is great on summer nights as well. All in all I give it 3.5 stars but I'll give them the bump up as I know I'll be back again :-)",

It's so festive, plenty of room for seating and mingling.  We had an option to have a set menu or order from the menu.  We had close to 60 people so we were informed it may take a little longer to get our food if we didn't do the set menu since everything is done from scratch.  Well that didn't happen, we took our chances and ordered from the menu!  The wait staff - Melissa, Brittany, Kevin and another gentleman that I'm sorry I didn't get his name were excellent!!  We needed for nothing!  We all ordered from the menu and it took no time for us to get our food and everything was hot and absolutely delicious!  I heard not one bad comment about anything.  Jenn stayed in constant contact with me about our reservation because the numbers kept going up on attendance.  I had the pleasure of meeting her when I first got there.  James Ragin/General Manager came out and introduced himself as well.  Everyone was constantly checking on us to make sure everything was up to our standards - the space, room temperature, food, beverage.  You couldn't ask for a more professional staff.  Everything was EXCELLENT!!  I highly recommend Village Tavern either for a small lunch or dinner and a large group like we had.  We'll be back next year for sure! GREAT job Village Tavern!  Thank you for everything, including your staff for taking such good care of us.  You made us feel so special!!",

We had a large party with one waiter and he handled the group well. So the service is good. The menu is pretty big with many selections at different price ranges. I wouldn't say the menu had anything particular that stood out. I ordered the blackened salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries. I liked how they gave you an option of what side you wanted and the sweet potato fries were not extra. The sweet potato fries were very good actually and seasoned with cinnamon sugar. I also ordered an appetizer salad and it was a general salad. The salmon was decent and fresh. In addition to dinner I got the organic Malbec wine and it was very smooth and a good price. I thought this was different because usually restaurants have more than one Malbec but this one had several to choose from so I appreciated that. This isn't a place I would go out of my way to go to but it is a good option if you are hungry and in the area.",

    "text": "Went for the first time on a business lunch around 12 and was very impressed.  It was already packed so we had to drive around for a parking space but luckily it didn't take long.    Dining: Seating was full at the regular tables with a 30 minute wait so we decided to sit at the family style high top tables, which was pretty neat! Since it was first come first serve seating and there was only 2 of us, we found a spot quickly.   Service: Awesome! I hate I forgot our waitresses name because she was the best. I tend to yelp everything when trying new places so I already had an idea of what I wanted from the lunch menu. I happened to mention to my lunch partner that I read how good the cajun seafood pasta was but it is only served at dinner so I would have to come back...he asked the waitress if it was possible to get it for lunch, she was so sweet and went to ask if it could be made...I was so excited when she said the chef would make it for me!   Food: Order the hot crab dip and thank me later.  Delish! My seafood pasta was so good and full of shrimp and scallops (I asked for no sausage). It has a spicy kick just like I wanted.  I was too stuffed to try dessert but will definitely be back to taste the warm butter cake I read about!",

When I nearly hit my head on the plastic take out box left on the banquette behind me, I should have known. When I heard the waitress, who had just pitched the \"5$ Friday night margaritas, mojitos and Moscow mules\", explain that \"mojitos are the ones with mint\", I should have known. When they filled a to go box at another table, at the table, I should have known...But, I stayed anyway, and ate a mediocre, Chili's would have been better and less expensive, dinner. Shame on me.",

It was served with lots of chicken and seasoned perfectly.   We also had the drink specials. My margarita was great and not watered down at all.  This place is beautiful inside and our service was great.   We will visit again soon.",

These we not old fashions, they were bad bourbon with water, no bitters, orange slice maraschino cherries stirred together. This is one of the only drinks I have ever returned. I ordered the clam chowder and received a 3/4 full cup of descent soup with no crackers or bread even offered. My wife had a Cesar salad that was a large portion that was just okay. I ordered shrimp and grits, they were again he just okay. I was not happy with the large pools or red oil or grease that was on top of the grits. This was the first time I've ever had S and G so I was a bit disappointed. My wife got the blackened tilapia with crab cream sauce. It was pretty tasty, but the sides looked and tasted uninspired, average rice pilaf and some soggy yet well buttered green beans. The 3.50 craft beers were a nice treat. Our service was rather poor, the server was new and not in tune with the customers needs. I was chuckling because the table had a now hiring ad in the specials placard. I also laughed when I looked around to see random bread baskets placed about the restaurant. I guess it's my fault for not asking. We were told all the food was scratch made, but I'm a bite skeptical myself. Not my favorite place while in Charlotte, but seeing how busy they were many must like it.",

I'm a creature of habit and always get the flat breads, but the salmon and trout are always good. Finally, I think this place has the BEST desserts in town...the double decker cheesecake is TDF, butter cake w vanilla ice cream and key lime pie are my other favorites. Oh and don't forget the chocolate torte. Never had the carrot cake or apple dessert. Go and enjoy the patio when it's cool out. You won't be disappointed here.",

Surprisingly for the quality, great food, higher end service and decor this place is very well priced. As a vegan/vegetarian and sometimes even pescatarian (I always choose balance over perfeccion), they are friendly, helpful and always accommodate to all my dietary restrictions and choices (which of course if you follow my reviews aside from great food you'll notice, flexibility and service are rank within highest in my ratings). In addition, they are family friendly, their bar gets super busy for those looking for conversation, and a good time. I highly recommend making reservations ahead of time as it kind get busy. You must order the grits and shrimp or scallops dish (it can be very greasy but they will accommodate to no bacon which makes it super greasy). Their Moscow mules drink is amazing I think because of the ginger beer they may use. If you live in Charlotte or you're just passing by, this is a stop you must plan to make. Enjoy!",

I used to go in Winston-Salem all the time as an undergrad at Wake so every time I go here, it's nostalgic.   Parking was \"extra special\" today for some reason and it took some time to find one. We ended up walking quite a bit. Parking has been an issue every time I have gone to this location in Charlotte. But, it was worth the hassle.  Despite the lunchtime rush, we were warmly greeted and seated quickly. Our server was gracious and honored my tight time commitment; I had a waxing appointment to get to!  We decided to do quick appetizers and wine. Our glasses were brought to us immediately. Never make me wait for wine! And appetizers followed shortly after.  We split hot crab dip (what I always got while at Wake) and ahi tuna. Both were delicious!  I had to rush out early but enjoyed the brief visit to an old-time favorite.",

Ok, back to the review...this place was packed for a Tuesday at 11:45am. That's always a good sign. I ordered the blackened chicken alfredo and it was on point. The price wasn't bad either, $12.95.

He swore it was worth giving it another try. So, I took him up on grabbing some dinner and have since been back several times.    The interior of the restaurant has been updated, more open and modern and not so dark as it was years ago.  The menu has kept some great staples, added some new additions, and I heard there is a new chef, which may explain the happiness we have had in the food. I have been for brunch and dinner and enjoyed a variety of items, but the crab cake dinner/sandwich and fries stands out. The fries are cooked just the way I like them. A little thicker and with the perfect amount of salt. And, one funny note. I don't typically mention a house salad, but they could have served one of the freshest house salads I have ever had, and it was huge. Served with lettuce, cucumbers, tomato, croutons and egg, it was great. And, try the Village Vinegerette, loved it!  I will forever thank Paul for making me give Village Tavern another try and think of him everytime I am there. Check it out.. Oh, and don't forget to try and enjoy the patio on a nice night.",

We are here because when j came I had a four month old and eating outside where I can fit a stroller is preferable in case he loses his mind. Village Tavern has a really nice (large) patio where were all comfortable bringing a baby (bonus..the baby did not freak!). Now to the food- I ordered the pimento BLT and the kitchen had a mix up so I did not get my food until way after every one else was done eating.. which is strange because a BLT is not very involved. Anyway, it was extremely bland. I honestly would never have known that there was pimento cheese on it if I couldn't see it with my own eyes. The bacon tasted like nothing. It was very strange. What a waste. The dip duo appetizer was good with guacamole, but the pimento cheese still wasn't great. My mom had a large salad she said was good. All the food being brought out LOOKED great. Wonderful presentation. I'll have to go back because maybe my sandwich was a fluke. I can imagine having a good brunch on the patio and downing mimosas one day!",

The tortilla chips tasted as if it was cooked in old oil so we ordered a new batch.  The dip was not work almost $14. We all ordered steaks (i ordered the ribeye). The steak was good - nothing amazing. I will say that the sweet potato fries were phenomenal. Service was good as well. Still recommend this place.",

Cocktails weren't great. My chicken salad sandwich was unimpressive. I mean, it's just chicken salad, but I could taste the mediocrity.  Our server had all of the social charm of an ex-con. He was brusque and inattentive. Never refilled our waters, so we were pretty thirsty from the humidity.   I mean, it's going to taste better than fast food, but I'm not clamoring to return.

The services was extremely slow - there should have been two waitresses for a party of that size. The food when delivered was delivered to the incorrect folks so that person kept saying \"sorry all of our table numbers are messed up.\"  Additional sides were never delivered - and again we are a party of 14. We ordered several drinks that we had to constantly ask about. After dinner we ordered several desserts - no water at the table. We asked. Then I went to the bar to get water. The warm butter cake was awesome but you really needed water. It's heavy.  I'd only come here again with a very small party. They just couldn't handle it.",

The 1st time was great so we decided to eat there again the following evening. Both nights we experienced great food and service. Our server Melissa the 1st time was great and we also met J. P. Swanson, the GM. He came over and introduced himself and also just really talked to us. Since we were into for a few days we decided to go back the 2nd evening and had Alex as our server. Again great food and great service. And again, J.P. stopped by and asked about our new grandson. J.P. also told us about the Village Tavern down here in So. Fla.  If you want great food and service check this place out! John A.",

Sit at the bar or try to get anyone that has hair or has an American accent to count on your service being great or better than great.  I Love their food and their management staff when something goes wrong, they go out of their way to fix it.  Use caution they have so much on their menu all the ingredients are not listed on all items at this time, so if you  order something like a contract make sure you read the fine print that not everything is listed.  Please check it out and keep your expectations reasonable and I do not think you will be disappointed in the food.",

I didn't care for the \"hash browns\" that it was served with. They definitely weren't hash browns, they were more like dinner potatoes. The side of Applewood Smoked Bacon was pretty good. My hubby had Southern Shrimp and Grits, which were good but very buttery. He devoured it.   We enjoyed our mimosas on the patio under the bright yellow umbrellas on a Sunday afternoon. I deducted a star because of our server. We had to constantly call for her attention since she never checked on our table and she was short when talking to us.  Overall nice atmosphere and good food.",

That had to be the best starter salad I've ever had. The veggies were fresh and the bacon was crispy like I like it. The seafood in the pasta was fresh and plentiful and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice.   I can not wait to go back and try some of the other menu options!",

After looking at reviews for places within walking distance of my hotel, I decide on Village Tavern (figuring the food looks good and I should be able to get a seat at the bar because according to reviews, this is off the beaten path).  Not only was the place packed - but there was no room at the bar.  After looking around (discouraged) I went outside to head to my backup choice.  It was then that, I assume, the manager comes out asking if I'm looking for seating for one and would I like to come back in he has a table for me in the back.  My server, Amanda, was friendly and wonderful.  New Yorkers can be plenty nice but we hate the phrase \"the big apple\".  Not sure how folks from Charlotte feel about \"southern hospitality\" but this was True southern hospitality.    Ordered a cab to drink and the ahi tuna entree salad - both delicious.  Then splurged and ordered sweet potato fries - which are as great as other Yelpers say.  Thanks, Village Tavern, for making this New Yorker right at home in Charlotte!",

I asked for it charred on the outside and mooing on the inside and that is exactly how it was delivered.  Marvelously flavored and exceptionally tender.

I ordered a sangria, she brought a glass with some liquid in the bottom of the glass and some fruit, I thought to myself what a small glass of sangria. She then proceeded to pour a small bottle of prosecco into the glass.  It was a very tasty glass of sangria, very different.

    "text": "You know what, I like this place.  It is easy to forget about good ol' Village Tav!   They are tucked away and removed from the mainstream \"southpark area\" so it is easy to forget they are there!  But, I am glad that we stopped in this past weekend.  It was a good reminder that this staple, south Charlotte location has every right to still be alive and well.  I ordered their spaghetti zucchini/squash dish.  It was incredible.  It had fresh broccoli and cauliflower mixed in with the garlic/olive oil and tomato sauce.  It had great texture and flavor and was just the right portion!  I left feeling healthy and satisfied!    Hubs ordered a \"gourmet burger\" but the only red flag is that he was not asked how he would like it cooked.  That can sometimes mean frozen patty or that it isn't made to order in some way.  It ended up being decent but not amazing.    They have so many  great options on the menu to choose from, such as pizza, fish, sandwiches, their homemade potato chips, dips, nachos, pastas, etc.  There is certainly something for everyone.  I had their crabcake meal a few months back and I have to say it was the best crabcake I have had in Charlotte.....hands down.  It had huge pieces of crab that were juicy and very fresh pouring out of the patty.  It was not stuffed with breadcrumbs or some other filler...it was really 95% crab.  It was a while ago that I had it so I need to get an update on the crab situation soon .    The atmosphere appears to be a bit pretentious when you first walk in.  It is lined with dark wood, a pretty vibrant bar scene, candles and dim lighting.  The outdoor patio is huge and they have a ton of specials going on throughout the week, including live music.  The prices and the menu itself let's you know that they are down to earth and you are welcomed even if you didn't just wrap up your 18th hole.   Are you going to see some loafers and khaki's?  Sure.  But were we perfectly comfortable in our jeans, beaters and t-shirts?  Sure were.    Overall it is a diversified spot that has many benefits and is worth keeping on your radar for a decent night out.",

    "text": "When I first started in the construction industry 15 years ago, before SouthPark was packed with every kind of restaurant imaginable, the place to see and be seen after work for my crowd was the Village Tavern patio.  Good times!  Flash forward to 2014...  I have been maybe 3 or 4 times in the past 10 years.  With my visit in June 2014, I noticed that they have remodeled extensively (my waiter said Labor Day 2013).  Gone is the heavy wood paneled wall that separated the bar and the dining area, the area is now very open and quite lovely.  As another review stated, the parking lot was deficient to begin with and now that construction barriers are blocking off one street, it is even worse.  Luckily,  I was early, so I was able to find a spot.  Had I needed to search for a spot, I would have crossed the street to SouthPark.  My waiter was pleasant enough, I recognized him from a previous visit, so it would seem he has been there for quite a while.  My drink was kept filled, food was brought promptly and smoking hot.  The food: Spinach Dip ($8.75) - Just as I remembered it - this is not your typical spinach dip.  While creamy and loaded with spinach, there are chunks of tomatoes and a definite jalapeno *zing* under the melted cheese topping.  I would like the tomatoes to be a little smaller, but that is a personal preference.  Served bubbling hot with tri-colored tortilla chips, this made a decent starter.  3.5/5 Gastropub Burger ($11) - Well, I didn't love it.  The caramelized onions were kind of tasteless.  The flavors didn't do it for me, it just tasted rather mushy and off.  With that said though, the burger itself was very juicy, cooked to medium perfection, though maybe someone was a little heavy handed with a peppery seasoning.  The bun also held up pretty well to the messy toppings and juicy beef. The potato salad that I got as a side (they also have fries or sweet potato fries), tasted exactly like the red skinned potato salad that Harris Teeter has, but it was sprinkled with bacon - it was good, and not overly mayo'ed.  2/5 (I would not order this burger again, but I would try another of their burgers, those coming out of the kitchen looked quite good).  Overall it was a nice visit.  With all of the food choices in the area, I don't know that I would rush to return, but it was a nice enough meal with good service.",

The restaurant is very nice although, we opted to sit outside. It was the best choice. They have such a pleasant outdoor seating area. The staff was very quick to help with getting our table set up. There was a light breeze that evening, music was playing and they have strung lights that come on. I enjoyed seeing the green grass and the trees swaying in the wind. We ordered the crab cake dip and we were worried it wouldn't come with enough bread. We asked for the bread basket but it turned out that the bread that comes with the dish was more than enough. I ordered coffee and it was perfect. The crab cake dip was so good. I ordered the crab cakes and they were very meaty and accompanied by the tarter sauce, they are the best crab cakes I've ever had. The drinks, the food, the service and atmosphere are perfect.",

The few times I could have visited, I didn't feel dressed enough to have a sit down. There were patrons dressed casually, but mostly everyone was a dressy casual.  I planned to have some calamari as an appetizer since I didn't try it last time, but my date chose the hot crab dip, and it sounded great to me. It tasted even better. I think he was saying it wasn't lump crab, but I couldn't hear much over my internal humming- the dish was great anyway. We even split the last chip! LOL   While I waited for my Cajun pasta, he had a salad and soup, both to his liking. He also chose the special Chilean Sea Bass with asparagus. We were taken aback by the small portion. At first, I thought it was a side, but that was his meal. Thankfully he ate those other dishes before. He said it was splendid, but felt that for the price a bigger piece would have been the right thing to do. I on the other hand, had more pasta than I could handle. The scallops were big and juicy! Perfect bites.  I still haven't made it out onto the huge patio yet, maybe next time.",

Today, I met my friend, John L, for a long overdue catch up session/lunch.  Could not find a salad that I wanted, mainly due to bacon bacon and more bacon, as well as other items that are not my favorites.  So, I got the grilled salmon with green beans and sweet potato fries.  They nailed it.  The salmon was cooked exactly as I requested.  The beans were delicious and the fries tasted like they were coated with cinnamon sugar.  What gets better than that?  The fries were served with a honey mustard sauce for dipping.  Yum yum yum!    This restaurant has a certain classy style.  It is not stuffy, but not too casual.  Service was efficient, however the server could have been a bit more engaging.  While I wish there were some different salad options, there are many other good dishes on the menu.  Plus, I realize that most people are huge bacon fans.  The bar area is elegant and I think it would be fun to just go sit there sometime.  I need to return here more often.",

There's many different options to choose from, they all sound amazing.  Here's the three items I've tried...   -Hot crab dip is an awesome appetizer option, pita bread comes served warm and soft. -Chicken Club is one of the better \"clubs\" I've had in recent memory.  Its pretty much a chicken sandwich served with plenty of chicken, ham and bacon served on warm, toasted bread (see pics). -Chicken Colorado was awesome!  All of the different foods - the chicken, black beans, rice, cheese, tomatoes worked perfectly together.  I am not sure if it was worth $18.50, but then again maybe it was.  I can't say one bad thing about the food here at Village tavern.    Service - Sat at the bar.  The lady bartender/server was awesome.  No complaints at all.   Ambiance - As others have stated, Village Tavern has a very unassuming quality to it.  It's kind of hidden in the back of some office/retail park.  The only way to identify Village Tavern is by the janky, blue awning that marks the entrance.  But once you're inside, its quite a different feel.  Elegant, open, classy, quaint, are all adjectives that come to mind.    The only thing I regret is that I am just recently discovering this hidden jewel in the heart of South Park.  There's about 20 other items on the menu I want to try. The service and ambiance are above and beyond my wildest expectations. No doubt I'll dine at Village Tavern again and hopefully soon!",

I also ordered the Cajun Seafood Fettuccine for 23.95 and my noodles weren't fettuccine in fact my plate came out with angel hair pasta. My mother ordered the same thing and she had fettuccine and it tasted completely different from mine. Turns out they'd ran out of fettuccine but they didn't make me aware of this until I complained about the food. For this to be such a high end restaurant I am very disappointed. But my waiter Stefan was very apologetic and understanding on the restaurants behalf.",

One of my favorite things about frequenting this establishment, a sandwich they make but is no longer on the menu, the prime rib sandwich. They will still make it for you if you ask and they will even prepare it for dinner if they are not to busy. Hands down the best for the money. The same sandwich at 131 Main is DOUBLE and for some reason not as good. I have not ordered one bad thing from there and i have been going for over 10 years. I even frequent the one in Atlanta when i'm down there for work. Don't let a little bad press ruin your opinion or detour you from eating here. It will be a mistake. I will definitely be heading back in the next couple of weeks for another bourbon and a definite prime rib sandwich.",

It kinda has a weird location--you can't really walk to it from anywhere or anything, but it has a huge parking lot so it's easy to get to via car.   And get there you should. There's a great bar there if you're up for a drink and a huge outdoor area if the weather's nice; you can have drinks back there as well food. One time we were this summer a guy was performing while we dined, which was nice.   The menu is pretty extensive and American-y, as you'd expect at a big ol' tavern that pumps the food out, but it's surprisingly good (though not the healthiest place now that I think about it) and high-quality.   I love their salads--all of them (and they have a lot). Try the Greek with the grilled salmon if you want a proven (and healthier) option. Pair with some wine, and you're all set for a great meal. And that's worth mentioning: tons of wine options, all very good.",

If the beat up wooden tables and furniture aren't enough, then treck down the long hallway to the mens or ladies room to get a sense of life in the 90s.

I ordered the margherita pizza and it was absolutely terrible!  The crust was so hard I couldn't even cut it with my serrated knife.  There was a ton of oil/grease on the pizza and the taste was bland at best.  Definitely the worst margherita pizza I've ever had.  How do you mess up pizza?!  If I didn't have a client with me, I would have complained and ordered something else.  My colleague's food was cold and our client said her lunch was \"so-so\".  Maybe the kitchen was having an \"off day\"?  With all the other choices in the SouthPark area, I don't see me going back any time soon.",

I know that sounds odd but it's True.  5 of us dined here on a Saturday for dinner, drinks and food was ordered.  15 minutes pass by and still no food while an adjacent table is seeing proper timing on food and drink delivery.  Our food finally comes a along with one salad instead of three.  A little off putting so far.  Our waiter apologizes and we are all offered free dessert from the manager.  Dinner continues and drinks are frequently low with little sight of  our server.  The manager is roaming however and like clockwork 60-90 seconds after she walks by, BAM, table service.  Anyway, dessert time, two of us pass and the rest order 2 double decker cheesecakes and a chocolate torte.  Upon presentation we recieve 2 key like pies and 1 torte.  Poor server must be having a nightmare of a day with his manager right now.  So at this point we all five now have dessert and are laughing hysterically at how many times one guy keeps messing up.  Conclusion here was that he must be new so we let all this slide and just enjoy a good laugh at his expense.  I give this a 4 because I couldn't give it a 5 after all the debacles but all 5 entrees were amazing and the dessert was fantastic.",

For the prices, $100 to feed my family (2 adult meals, 1 app, 4 kids meals and 6 soft drinks, no alcohol, no dessert), the food should have been much, much better. Every thing taste pre-made, like out of a can or jar, not pre-made at the restaurant. It wasn't bad food, just way over priced for low end average. I could have gone to Chili's and had better food for less than half the price. Or I could have gone right around the corner to Rooster's or Bricktops and for the same amount of cash, had excellent food.

They have daily specials and to my benefit, I happened to be there on $3 off classic cocktails. I ordered a old fashion spirited which was my first time having this beverage BUT my taste buds were immediately flattered. I proceeded to the table where he majority of his guest were already seated waiting for the arrival of the birthday boy. One thing I did dislike which explains the loss of stars is how no one approached the table to initiate appetizer orders, drink orders or anything until much, much later. I'm not sure of their policy but it just amazed me bc there were several hungry people there as well as thirsty. It didn't dawn on me until I had to get up again to order my second old fashion and I think by this time our server got the hint and finally approached the table. I ordered the calamari and oysters which were a little over cooked and tasted entirely too much like fried flour. All in all, I enjoy a nice drinking spot and maybe that's what this establishment is best for.",

Came to celebrate my boyfriends 30th (which I called 2 weeks ahead of time for a party of 10) Waitress, Claire or something like that barely checked on us at all and showed obvious irritation at us. What irritated me the most was that at the end of dinner, when she brought the desert for his birthday she just said \"here\" and left. Literally have no idea why we received such horrible service from the start. Food was ok, but for the amount I paid for apps, drinks and entrees I will NEVER come here again for anything. though after the hepatitis breakout they would have valued second chances.",

When I first looked up Village Tavern on the map, I thought \"Ok, that's interesting...it looks like it's in an office building.  I'm not sure how fun this place is going to be.\"  It took about five minutes of being there to fall in love.  The food was great (except they left a label on the lettuce, which was weird, but I pushed it off to the side).  I had a salad, although I really wanted to order a burger.  Ranch dressing was really good and I would come back just to find more things to dip in the ranch!  Wine selection was pretty strong.  Great bottle and by-the-glass selection.  I opted for a glass on the Slingshot...you definitely can't go wrong!  It's a delicious red.  Village Tavern has some great weekly specials, too.  Overall, a great place to come on a date or to meet a group.  The bar area is pretty big and they have several communal tables.  When it gets warmer, I definitely want to check out the patio!",

The restaurant is a mix of booths, tables and high-tops. There is a large bar with maybe 20 seats and two TVs. They have a full bar and have a good selection of both beer and wines by the glass. Prices are fair.  The menu is extensive and the style is American-fare. They have super sandwiches and tasty burgers. The beet salad is excellent if you want something lighter. There is also a good number of small plates that are perfect for sharing.   Village Tavern has probably one of the best patios in Charlotte. Perfect for a pre Pops-in-the-Park drink and snack in June or a lazy lunch anytime.  Enjoy!",

Food arrived and I was given the wrong salad that had chicken added to it (which I did not ask for).

I have to say the best omelette still goes to pancake house on cherry street!   I tried the crab cakes and they were lightly seasoned and delicious with a light brown flaky crust.   This place can be difficult to find because of construction but more difficult because you don't think a restaurant belongs here. Be sure to google or yahoo map it here as parking is in the front.   Nevertheless, I think terrace cafe is better and Nolen's on Sewlyn , but I would say this place is better than about 80% of brunch paces out there and worth the try!",

We sat down and it was over 20 mins before I got fed up and had to flag down a server for drinks. Another 20 minutes went by before the server came back to take a food order, god knows what was taking so long, it wasn't busy and I'm pretty sure we were her only table. The servers were all aware it's a birthday brunch yet made little or no effort to accommodate this. We had to wait over 20 minutes again for our food to start trickling in. 3 people got their food - 5 minutes went past, another two, another 5 minutes and 2 plates Came out. By his time some food had been sat there 10 minutes going cold and some hadn't even been served including the birthday girl! One order came out wrong so had to be sent back, finally the remaking food came out so we could eat. Mine was now cold as were others but we ate as were hungry. Once we had all finished the remaining plate came out to eat when everyone was finished.  There was no apology. No explanation as to what happens and why it all took so Long. The food was ok - slightly over priced for what it was but ok. If I had the option, I wouldn't choose to go here again and I feel sorry for the birthday girl here as no one really had a good time.  Of you go, make sure you have nothing to do for the rest of the day and take an iPad of book to keep you entertained",

On a cold day, it was nice to retreat into the woody warmth of Village Tavern, and although it was pleasantly bustling with the business lunch crowd, we still scored a nice table.  I really do like the atmosphere, and in nice weather, the patio is where it's at.  They have a number of vegetarian dishes, all of which are helpfully marked.  I had the house-made veggie burger, which wasn't memorable but was certainly better than a frozen patty from a box.  In my view, they tried to make it a little too much like a burger burger and forgot that veggie burgers should be developed and enjoyed on their own merits.  Next time, I'll order sans lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Still, it was a nice place for a work lunch, and since they have several veg. options, I imagine I'll be back for lunch in the future.",

Appetizer, salad and entree choices are varied and quality is consistent.  Service usually strikes good balance between attentiveness and letting you relax with your drink or meal.  It's a popular place and the surface parking lot frankly inadequate.  One local access road is currently closed due to a massive construction project nearby.  Certainly not the cheapest but with the maddening similarity between far too many restaurants in the area it's a relief to find a place where the food doesn't taste like another rush job from a microwave, fryer or bain marie.  One might not expect a posh restaurant to draw families with kids but VT's proximity to the mall and residential areas means that the little darlings visit in their droves. The waiting area occasionally resembles a McDonald's PlayPlace with outside voices freely exercised.  For a bit of peace be clever about your time of visit, early or late, and/or sit at the expansive bar.",

    "text": "I was so inspired by my latest visit to VIllage Taven that  I am writing my first Yelp review!  I have been going to VIllage Tavern for years.  My family has always used it for a special place for graduation, birthday, etc dinners.  We went when my sister graduated from law school in August. We made a reservation since we were a large party, and since the table was not ready, we had to sit in the hallway and wait, as many of the older people in our party were uncomfortable sitting at the bar.  Then, they were out of most things on the menu, and the food that we did get was only average.  Not what I had come to expect.  Fast foward to this past Friday night.  We went again to celebrate a friend's graduation from law school.  His family had come from PA, so we wanted to take them somewhere we knew was nice.  We again made a reservation since we were a party of 16.  We got there, the table was not ready, and after some back and forth with the hostess, they wanted us to sit outside in a tent (maybe nice in the summer, but not in December), with plastic chairs and at seperate tables, where there was a loud party going on in the tent already.  We told them we wanted to sit inside and together, so they shuffled us back inside, where we continued to wait on a table.  We were repeatedly told that they were sorry, the party that came before us didn't want to get up, but never once did we see a manager.  The poor hostess was trying her best to accomodate, but we really should have spoken to the manager at this point.  We were finally sat inside (around 10pm, an hour after our reservation) and we were 4 seats short at the table.  They told us that we would have to wait until the table next to us got up, which seemed to be no time in the near future.  So, at this point, most of us are sat, some are standing, and we have been there an hour.    I have to admit, we were given four free appetizers (for the party of 16), and that just didn't make up for the experience.  I think after years of coming to Village Tavern, these two experiences have been my last.",

I mean literally I can't remember what I ordered but the memory of the chips remain!  Oh that's right it was the scallops over fresh succatash which were  really good although not too filling.

It's pretty amazing to me that they've been around as long as they have, and that they are not resting on there reputation (ie: getting lazy).  I've seen numerous restaurants that just get lazy after 8 years or so.  Keep up the great work.",

    "text": "Such a shame that I came here during an awful heatwave, their outdoor patio looked spacious and nice. The place looks pretty nice inside with dark wood, warm colors, and dim lighting all around.  I went for the restaurant week menu while my date just wanted something light and ordered off the menu. Starting off with the crab cake app. it was flavorful and the crab tasted fresh and slightly sweet. My only complaint would be that it is freaking tiny! I ate it in 2 bites, and I take tiny bites so I hope this is not representative of their regular size crab cake app. If it is I recommend ordering the crab cake sandwich as an app which was more sizable for only $2 more. Next came the salad which I really liked, not too much dressing and a nice flavor combination. I wanted their maple cured pork chop initially as an entree but they had run out of it by 6:30 apparently. So I settled for the server's recommendation of bayou shrimp. The sauce on the shrimp was a bit too salty, the rice it was served on helped a little bit with that though, and the seasoned green beans served alongside it were probably the most awful I've ever had. There were stems and very tough fibers on them that were extremely hard to overlook. This was quite a shame since they were seasoned nicely and I liked the flavors but they were quite inedible. Dessert however was just awesome, I opted for some warm apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce drizzled everywhere. Delicious!  Service was surprisingly attentive even though we visited during crw. The food was overall enjoyable even if I feel like portions here are a bit on the small side.",

I enjoyed the appetizers, the meals, sides and craft drinks.  The service was always good and sometimes exceptional.  They were and are a busy spot, but you can go and enjoy a comfortable meal and get a seat by the fireplace which I love since it was cold out a lot.  I would give different cuts of meat a try and most of the time the meat was cooked to my liking and if it was not it was taken care of.  I always love a restaurant that brings you hot bread and softened butter and they sure do that.  Desserts were good and a great ending to your meal.  Things to try:  bacon wrapped scallops, spinach tortilla dip, pimiento deviled eggs, pizzas, french onion soup, steak au poivre, flies and the list goes on.  There are many a locations to choose from so if you are moving through town you should hit at least one of them.  ToGo orders are well done and worked out well for me.  This is a solid restaurant and a good choice.  In fact, just writing this makes me hungry and want to order from there now!",

We were able to bring in an outside birthday cake with candles and the staff stored in kitchen until the end of our dinner. We really appreciated that; she was so surprised. The food was good ranging from burgers, grilled meatloaf, pasta, crab cake sandwich, teriyaki chicken. The spring rolls were very good and filling. Saturday is $3 off martinis; so definitely recommend the three berry cosmos. I ordered crab cake sandwich it was more of a crab cake salad- I wouldn't recommend. It was very busy so it took our waitress a bit longer to take our drink order and food orders but she had a few tables. Otherwise the experience was great and my grandma fully enjoyed her dinner.",

Went on a Saturday early evening, there was no wait to sit outside and so we sat out. The service was slow even though we didn't order a ton of items. Constantly had to remind our server to bring items. The drinks were good, I liked the Tiki drink I had and my friend liked her margarita. we enjoyed the free bread but didn't quite like the food we paid for haha. The thai chicken nachos were just okay, could have had more chicken and better sauce and the spring rolls too lacked taste. We didn't entree here and decide to leave after sub par service experience and not so amazing food. Ambience is cute for a date night. PS: you can park free in the underground garage.",

Other than being in an odd location, we found the experience to be enjoyable and the food was fantastic.  I had their asian fish special and I can say that it will bring me back again as it was savory, fresh and filling.  I also had a few drinks and they were all delicious.  We finished off the meal with their butter cake and let me tell you, that is pure delight!  Wow...its cake with melted butter and that is really all it needs...but then they do better and add ice cream!  Wow.  Don't let the reviews scare you away.  We had a good experience, including good service.  You should definitely give it a try!",

    "text": "Yelp removed my last review of Village Tavern because someone at Yelp incorrectly decided that my review was motivated by the recent media coverage related to Hepatitis concerns at Village Tavern, rather than actual experiences there. For sake of clarity, you should know that I work around the corner and have eaten at Village Tavern over 30 times, including (unfortunately) relatively recently, and the following is based on those experiences. I used to love it. That is not currently the case.  This restaurant started out great years ago, and was more or less an institution. Then it was remodeled, and it was even better. And it was great until about a year or two ago, and then it declined precipitously.   Why that happened, I do not know. But I know this: within a short period of time, the glasses and utensils became consistently dirty (similar to the SouthPark P.F. Changs, also quite nasty in this respect); many of the waiters became slow, discourteous and curt; the cocktails seemed week; reservations no longer seemed to matter (i.e., I would reserve on OpenTable and still be asked to wait 15 minutes); and everything that had been good about this restaurant disappeared. And you can read the recent coverage in the Charlotte Observer for confirmation of some of my concerns about cleanliness here.   The last time I ate here, which was over the summer, my waiter, a guy with an English accent, greeted me with a \"What do you want.\" Other than bringing the drinks, food, and the check (all of which were thrown down on our table with a grunt) he never returned again. He never checked on the quality of the meal, never refreshed our sodas, never asked if we needed anything else. The entire ordeal must have been a huge inconvenience for him. That kind of service at Village Tavern is not at all unusual these days.  As for the food, there is a school of thought that says if a restaurant serves everything, nothing is likely to be exceptional. That is definitely True here. At Village Tavern, if you dare to go now, you can get everything from nachos to a steak, or from pizzas to a reuben. Fish, hamburgers, you name it. At one point this summer they had pasta-less spaghetti. Probably still do. It is all terribly plain. Except the pasta-less spaghetti, which is actively bad. A watery, gross mess.   I would never recommend that anyone eat here. Period.",

There is a huge outdoor patio that is excellent on moderate days which receives the same service and services that takes place in doors.  Very much a business lunch spot sprinkled with ladies taking a break from nearby mall shopping.  And children have space to play outside, but need to be supervised.  Menu is excellent.  Many choices, so just about anyone will find something that they like.  Prices are reasonable and the wait staff are professionally on point.  Parking can be an issue as they just have a long strip outside the entrance.  Tight to turn around and if it is very full you need to park in adjacent parking areas.  We have eaten here for lunches and dinners, many times bringing neighbors and friends.  We are somewhat regulars.  You can easily converse at your tables without shouting or waiting for a noise pause.  The atmosphere hums, making for a pleasant meal or just drinks and snack.",

He made great drink and food recommendations.  The atmosphere is classy, but not stuffy.  Had the brussel sprouts (outstanding), Baja salmon taco (also outstanding-probably the best fish taco I've had), and the sweet potato fries (good, but would have preferred salt on them instead of sugar).  The bartender and hostesses were all friendly and welcoming. Can't wait to go back to sit on the patio when it's not so hot. Highly recommend the restaurant...this is now at the top of my favs list.",

Crab dip was great (LOTS of crab meat), bruschetta was a-ok (bread could've been more flavorful), home made potato chips probably tasted better when they first came out, and calamari was a tad too crispy. Flowing drinks, fantastic patio, Sinatra impersonator = pretty cool place to chill after work.   Although, note that if you don't meet the visual requirements of the hostesses, they'll give you the up and down (and not in a good way).",

We sat outside on the patio which is nice. The service was not good though. The wait stuff was rude and acted like we were such a burden. At the end, they overcharged each of my friends by $30. That was the icing on the cake.

After 25 mins, an empty sparkling water bottle and my husbands empty beer - the server brings me a side salad and my husbands sandwich.   I was like hmmm this is tiny and there's no chicken. I'm pregnant and starving (hence the long wait) so I was like leave me the side salad.   He said it doesn't come with chicken but I can get you some - gee thanks!  So kindly, he brings me a plain chicken breast after I've finished my tiny salad. The server is totally oblivious, I'm finished and all of our drinks are still empty due to the ridiculous wait. The person at the table behind us ordered the same salad I ordered, (I had entree envy) so clearly I'm not imagining the salad I've had in the past. So the additional chicken was added to the bill and we paid more than the actual salad I ordered. We would have ordered more beer and pellegrino but that was too much effort to deal with this server any more who is not mindful of the situation. Terrible service.",

It's across the street from my office, so we're in here often.  Don't miss their own made chips with ranch dressing. Excellent on the side with one of their burgers instead of fries, they are just as good as a shared appetizer if you're just having drinks.  Speaking of burgers, don't miss 'em. Good quality meat with the right toppings, or get one of their pizzas. I like the margretira which has sliced tomatoes and fresh basil.  I've been here a bunch of times and I'll be back again a bunch more!",

Food was ready, and hostess and bartender taking my order were very nice. Ambiance of the place looks very nice and quiet, so I'd like to return for a sit down dinner one evening. Got my food home and was pretty good. Rib was cooked just the way I like it, medium. You could cut it with a fork! The mac and cheese was good, and the sauteed spinach was good, but a little salty for my taste. Bottom line-you get a good meal for a decent price so I'll go back.",

Now that the menu and decorations have been updated, this place is great! I had 2 items from the appetizers- the calamari and the scallops. She had the veggie burger. We split the apple crumble with ice cream dessert. ALL WERE EXCELLENT! The scallops had a teriyaki sauce and there were 3 large scallops on the plate. The calamari came with some kind of sauce but I changed it to a marinara which was good. The dessert was huge, fresh, and the ratio of ice cream to cake was perfect. DEFINITELY COMING BACK!!",

I ordered the Cobb salad and it was probably the worst example of this typical entree salad I've ever had. It was literally soaked in average blue cheese dressing - think slop. Everything was chopped up and mixed together soaked in dressing.  Then I decided to order the \"spring rolls\" hoping it would be better and giving them a chance to redeem themselves in my opinion - oh well that didn't happen! Think American style egg rolls with 3 different incredibly average dipping sauces.  So lesson learned - pleasant walk to the restaurant but the food is badly executed. The service at the bar though was fine no complaints - friendly and complete. The kitchen and the implementing of dishes is where the failures lie.",

With the tree tops in full bloom, it almost felt like we were in another country. Really great location.  The staff was really great and friendly and did a good job checking on us.  The only real reason I am giving this a three star is because for the price, I was not really impressed with the food. And above all else that matters. Please don't misread me. The food was not bad at all. There was nothing wrong with it. I just think for what it was, it could have been much less in cost. That is just my personal opinion and I'm sure that is not True for everyone or perhaps even across their menu board.",

I would have assumed a Thursday evening would have had a great environment but we were a group of 6 and there couldn't have been more than 20 others.  Bar menu was good, appetizers we only okay.  We specifically asked if the turkey burgers were fresh ground and fresh patties or frozen.  We were assured they were great fresh burgers but it came out in a flat circle, not a juicy fresh patty.  I ordered a 'very rare' 16oz Prime Rib and it came out most certainly medium well, very grey and no juices.  Quite a disappointment from what I had seen photographed.  It was an hour from closing so I didn't send it back.  To have purchased the Prime Rib, and app for the table, a bottle of wine, and a Turkey Burger, the total with 20% was $130.  I could certainly find better places in SouthPark and the Midtown for that price.",

Was greeted by hostess and GM or assistant GM was nearby and walked me over to the party locale which was set up in a nice area outside the actual restaurant, but well-heated.  Service at the holiday party was great.  Cleared plates for us, took drink orders, and had the right attitude.  Dunno the chick's name, but she did a good job.  Even when I was leaving, the hostess dude caught up to me and asked how I liked the event and bid farewell.  It seems minor, but the restaurant service was hospitable.  FOOD:  Pretty average.  I'm not sure if its our fault (do we select entrees?) or theirs, but the spread was eclectic.  Chicken skewers, boneless chicken wings, egg rolls, veggie mix, meat balls, some broccoli-cheese casserole-looking thing, and flat soda.  Please check your soda before serving it - probably left over from the previous holiday party or something.  Egg rolls were soggy upon service and meatballs were cold.  It was a hellishly random collection of dishes that didn't really go well together.  If it's the holiday planning party committee's fault, then sorry Village Tavern!  I'm not particularly interested in trying the restaurant itself based on the food.    dmo out.",

    "text": "Stopped after work Friday evening to meet a buddy of mine.  He is from Greensboro, but had a business meeting in South Park. So I suggested we meet at Village Tavern...a staple in my mind for the great food, drinks and atmosphere.  I moved from South Park in 2012 and was really looking forward to hitting Village Tavern again. Yikes! What a disappointment :(  At 5:30 the patio was practically empty.  But actually, that was great for us to sit down, have a drink and chat.  We chose a table with the umbrella closed on purpose...the weather that evening was awesome.  Unfortunately, no less than three employees, one of which appeared to be a supervisor/manager, came to our table, reached over us WITHOUT ASKING, and opened the umbrella. When we made it clear we did not want it opened, one employee even said something like, \"All of the umbrellas will be opened\".  Basically meaning, \"Regardless that you are a patron who out of all the establishments in South Park, chose Village Tavern after work as your place to unwind, we are going to decide for you whether the umbrella on your table is opened.\"  The last employee who tried this left our table with an attitude...all because we did not want our umbrella opened...really?  It's not as if the patio was clamoring with patrons...there was literally just four other tables with customers when we arrived at 5:30.  We left at 7:00 and still the patio was half empty. Wonder why...this place used to be slammed during happy hour.  I left feeling embarrassed that I chose Village Tavern to \"showcase\" the South Park area.  Thank god for our sever, Laura, who really saved the day with her energetic smile and willingness to please.  She smoothed over the ridiculous actions of her fellow staff members with ease.  A True gem :)  Go Laura!",

From the description we think it's a casual restaurant. My boyfriend and his friend are wearing nice t-shirts, should have worn at least a polo.. From the start of the dinner our waitress Katie treated us like we A. Shouldn't be there and B. Like we couldn't afford to be there. It was actually quite insulting.   We started with drinks, some Moscow mules, they were pretty good but did taste like they were made with ginger ale instead of ginger beer. Our waitress said she would bring us water, but didn't until we asked her again.   She did not come back for at least 15 minutes and when she did she skipped asking us about appetizers and asked if we were ready to order dinner. Which we weren't, but did order the hot crab dip. It was delicious.   After another 10 - 15 minutes she came back to take our order. We asked her what she suggested and she offered several of her favorites from the menu.   I had read that the Mac and cheese was really good so I just had to order that, and the Pimento Bacon Cheeseburger. I was actually disgusted by how much grease was on both the burger and in the mac and cheese. The bottom bun of the burger was soaked in grease, I did not eat it.   My boyfriend ordered the firecracker shrimp tacos and absolutely loved them! Our friend had the shrimp and grits and said they were good, but very greasy also. The three of us are currently suffering from some stomach issues.. If you know what I mean.   Overall I felt like this restaurant was overrated and the service was personally insulting because of what the guys were wearing. Or maybe I'm thinking too much into it and the server just didn't care about making our experience great.",

Waiter let me sub the awesome blue & blackberries instead of the potatoes (thank you!) 4. the Muffin  Also loved the decor inside.

Our waitress (I think her name is Melissa) was very helpful with descriptions of items on the menu and recommendations. My husband ordered a local craft beer (25oz/great value) and we got a bottle of wine for the table. The wine was a great Malbec (Argentinian I believe). We both ordered the steak au poivre. IT WAS DIVINE!!!!!!  The sauteed spinach was the best we have ever had. For dessert we ordered the carrot cake. It was super moist with delicious cream cheese icing. Fabulous dinner!!!  We absolutely recommend Village Tavern, and we will certainly be going back soon!!!!",

Both burgers were very juicy and cooked to perfection. You know it's good when the juice is all over your face and fingers. The bread had the perfect soft toast texture to add to the deliciousness.  The ambiance was light and friendly. There were people dressed up and people with t shirts Nd shorts. Everyone who worked there from the hostess to the bar tender were friendly and appeared happy to seems. The secret sauce on the tavern burger is quite spicy but the heat goes away quickly. The onions on the pimento cheese burger make it sweet I would definitely order food from there again.",

    "text": "I would describe my girlfriend and my visit to Village Tavern as the quintessential 4 star experience in my opinion - everything was good, but nothing really blew us away.  I ordered the pimento bacon cheeseburger and she got the crispy chicken tacos. Her crispy chicken tacos were probably the best part of both meals; the crispy, spicy chicken went perfectly with the sweetness of the slaw. The sides of rice and black beans were just average, however. My pimento bacon cheeseburger was good, but the bacon was overwhelming. It had 4 huge strips of bacon, which normally I wouldn't mind but the bacon was simply too sweet. I know that sounds odd, but it was almost candied bacon with strong maple/sugar taste. My comment after my first bite was \"wow that was really... sweet\", which is almost never something you say eating a burger. I took 2 of the 4 strips off and finished the burger, and it was better. The burger was cooked medium as I asked, but it lacked a great char or any meaty flavor that you look for. The caramelized onions were excellent but the pimento cheese was average. It was a decent burger overall, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries on the side too.  Our server was pretty friendly but somehow just seemed a bit odd in his actions. Also I got mayo on my burger after asking for them to leave it off, but that was no big deal to me since it took 5 seconds to scrape most of it off. We were also pretty set on trying the brownie dessert after an initial glance at the menu, but he actually talked us out of it when he described all the desserts and said the brownie and another choice weren't very good. The food was solid, but nothing really wowed us and made us strongly want to come back. I'd say Village Tavern is a good, safe option for quality food but nothing that you must try.",

We had 3 orders of crispy chicken tacos and the chicken was so burned that we couldn't even cut into it.  My chicken Colorado was burned to a brick. Awful. The waiter never came back to check on the food after the food runner dropped it off. All of the orders were burned and cold. It took an hour to be served after placing our order. After dinner we moved to the bar to have a drink and the bartender was HORRIBLY rude.  Awful.  Dear owners....Please just give up and close.  They obviously don't care.  Do not waste money here.

I think that maybe he was annoyed by my cousin's vegan questions which honestly I would've been annoyed also but he did a good job at helping her out with it. He recommended some drinks for us and then ended up buying mine since it was my birthday which I thought was sweet. Hope to come here again with my boyfriend some time.  Appetizer: Flash fried calamari - loved it entree: chicken colorado - pretty good drink: (forgot what it was called but it had the word 'cuban' in it) - pretty good, i also tried the painkiller which i thought was good also",

    "text": "Went back to VT last night to meet a friend, and the food, service and atmosphere was just as good if not better than my first trip here!   First important tip: Wednesday is HALF OFF WINE night! Ya HOO! There are some exceptions on their \"higher end\" stash, but I can live with the other choices. So I ordered a Meomi Pinot Noir, and for half off, the bottle only came to like $20 or so! GREAT Deal since that's about what it is in the stores (yes I know, but I've come to grips with the dreaded price doubling of wine in restaurants).   So to start, my friend recommended the freshly made chips with ranch sauce. Perfectly crispy, a little salt, and yummy ranch dressing. Spot on. Personally I would have liked a TAD more salt on them, but no major complaints.  So I've seen their steak menu and after a LONG, HARD workout, I convinced my body that I need PROTEIN to feed those muscles of mine.......my brain fought back but the muscles won! So I ordered the 10oz Filet, cooked medium rare (of course - I'm not a fan of shoe leather), and opted for their cognac cream sauce. I make a killer Au Poivre with Congna Cream sauce at home, so I admit to being a little snobby when it comes to this sauce. Quite frankly mine IS better, but this one was pretty good. I'd recommend the Bernaise Butter over the Filet though.....that will be my next choice.   For my side I chose the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and the Spinach. Both were excellent! The Mac & Cheese was very good as the outside was crispy (i.e., slightly burned) and I LOVE THAT! My only addition would be to add a dash of Truffle Oil. But that's just me......I'm a Truffle Oil fool. The spinach was cooked perfectly as it was sauteed in olive oil and garlic, with the requisite amount of wilting yet maintained a good firm texture.   OK so I've talked about the sauce, but have been remiss to describe the FILET! One word: PERFECTION! The quality of the beef was excellent (Prime???) but it's the way it was prepared that was awesome. The outside was crispy due to the apparent high heat oven yet the inside was literally MELT IN YOUR MOUTH tender! And as you can see in the photos, it WAS cooked perfectly to Medium Rare. All this really needed was a little butter on top (again recommend the Bernaise Butter) and it was truly superb! Coming from a Beef town like Chicago, I am singing this restaurants high and well-deserved praise!  All in all this was a GREAT meal! Very reasonably priced for the quality of food served, and the service is always very, very good.   Kudos to the Management Team at VT! Don't know if that's recently changed or what given some of the pooer reviews from the past. But this is my thrid time here and all three times, each has been FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE!  Bravo!",

    "text": "VT has several locations, I used to frequent one in Winston-Salem, NC. They have a good menu but the Charlotte restaurant is poorly designed making seating problematic. They have booths on the perimeter of the space along the windows, and a sizable bar area on the other side of the restaurant. In the middle section there are about six four tops tables situated very close to one another and very close to the bar. The bar has long high top tables and IMHO is too large. They could remove some of the bar space since they aren't really a sports bar and extend the regular dining area.  I will also point out that the restaurant is located in area with hotels and office buildings and has a small parking lot. There is no street parking. You sometimes have to wait for a diner to exit the lot to get a spot.  The first time we went to this location, we were seated at one of the four tops and we were right on top of a group for whom they have moved tables together. We were able to move to an available booth. The last time we were seated in the same are and a group with several kids were seated a  long high top table very close to us. As is often the case, the parents were not attending them and the kids were running everywhere- as a side note this is NOT a  good restaurant for small children; they do not appear to have areas to accommodate families. We asked to be moved to a booth or another four top away from the kids and were told those were reserved for reservations who had not shown up yet. The fact that we also had a reservation didn't seem to matter. After our server spoke to the manager, the best he could do was put at a high top in what looked like a hallway off from the bar which would have been like not being in the restaurant at all. We decided to leave and went to another restaurant.   We will not return. It's too much hassle to dine here and there are numerous other restaurants in Charlotte that have  comparable menus and offer a better dining experience.",
