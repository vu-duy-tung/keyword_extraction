The staff and place are ok for an airport but the food wasn't good - I ordered the Roll and it came with waffle fries that tasted like oil and they were cold. The roll came with this tiny pieces of lobster and it didn't even taste good. I'll probably avoid next time and will pick one of the other several places in the airport.",

Yes, there's nothing worse when you know someone is only nice to you so they can get your money. So when you order at the bar \"to-go\" and they completely ignore you and won't even get you the glass of water they offered you while waiting, it just confirms what I said before.   You can totally tell their fake customer service and their fake chit-chat small talk is a poor attempt to solicit tips.  I had the crab cakes & egg breakfast combo. It smelled weird and turned me of but for the price I forced myself to eat it on the plane, and the food itself, is okay....",

Did not need to adjust any seasonings with the salt, pepper, or seafood spice. Being in an airport setting, it was a busy time at linh, but our waitress did a great job circling to all tables and checking in with our needs. Great experience and would go back again!",

Seemed like most choices were either fried or deep fried.   The one in Baltimore has the world's best pan seared lump crab cake in the world.    Airport not so much.    Ordered that crab cake sauteed  and only choice was fried.   Turned out to be deep fried in not great oil.    Really a shame.   Phillips in MD set the standard for a 5 star crab cake.   Their satellite locations did not learn well from home office........      Staff was very pleasant and attentive.  No issues with service - just not the Inner Harbor MD Philips that I was use to.     3 stars based on great service - but they could use a schooling from Home base in Baltimore.",

And the food was definitely better than any of the \"fast food\" options you are bound to be tempted to try at the airport.  I ordered the crabcake and had it tossed into a toasted bun.  The crake cake was cooked on the grill (not deepfried) which was definitely a plus.  The crab was light and flavorful and was definity worthy of ordering again.  Overall, not a bad spot to come grab a beer and a bite if you are between flights in Charlotte and have a hankering for some crab.",

I was interested in something other than the typical airport wrap, taco or burger. I had the Ahi Tuna as recommended by the server. The tuna was a bit on the chewy side.  The vegetable medley and Cole slaw were tasty. Phillips won't be in the running for Charlotte's best seafood anytime in the near future. But, the Server was prompt, courteous and efficient. Given prompt service and a nice spacious window seat for people watching, I can forgive a lot of things.  Next time, I'll try the crab cakes.  They looked very good!",

The Crab Cake was the best part of my meal, a lot of crab, but the cole slaw was drab and the withered lemon wedge and wilted lettuce told me this place doesn't have top-notch preparation.  Waffle fries were good.  Lipitor chaser optional. BThe crab soup was watery, not creamy, and the beer forgettable.  The lighting was harsh, too, but for $40 plus tip, I got a sembling passage of North Carolina cuisine, and great service.

It's not bad for airport food. If you think of it with any other mentality, it'll be like average diner food. I ordered the miniature crabcakes since crabcakes seem to be a signature dish. They were a bit dry, and crumbled apart too easily. It was flavorful though and definitely didn't need the tartar sauce. The seafood bisque hit the spot. It tasted like good comfort homemade soup that was made with hours of care over a stove. The hint of Phillips seafood rub in it added a slight kick.",

Had I known it would cost more than a BOTTLE of wine ($19.50), I wouldn't have bothered. So, thanks, Phillips, for letting me experience the most expensive glass of just ok house wine in my life.   I ordered a Caesar salad and crab cake bites. The Caesar was the worst I have ever had. Basically romaine lettuce, croutons and some shredded parm with.. Wait for it... Italian dressing! I kid you not. I had to ask if they gave me the wrong dressing because it was definitely Italian and not Caesar and sure enough, it was awfully correct. This salad was $9. The crab cake bites were good, but 5 super tiny bites for what they charged was nuts.   I'm still in shock. My bill came to $49 including tip. The biggest rip off I've experienced in a long time.   Tip: go elsewhere. I should have sensed trouble when I walked in at peak lunch time to discover a wide open bar.",

    "text": "This is a difficult review to write. Initially, I had my mind set on 2 stars. I had high expectations for the advertised lobster roll (Maine lobster, shaved lettuce, brown butter aioli, grilled roll). Well, when the dish arrived it looked kind of messy, as if they just threw the 2 rolls and fries on the plate in a hurry. The was obviously no QC on this dish as it exited the kitchen. It was not bad, it was just Ok and the pickle was missing  from the plate. However, the waffle seasoned fries were really good. And the thing that made me give this place 3 stars was my server. He was prompt and attentive and to make it even more difficult he offered and prepared to-go drinks to his customers so we did not have to spend a fortune at airport prices while we waited for our connection.",

I even buy it in Harris Teeter in the frozen section from time to time. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. For half an arm, you get the smallest, thinnest crab cake, 5 fries & fruit. While the crab cake was very good, not a lot of filler. I doubt i'd pay for it, or anything in this restaurant, without the backing of a company reimbursement again.",

I should have known from the sign that said Pasterized Crab Meat. I'm a crab lover and being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I always have access to fresh crab. This was not the case.   With a limited menu, I ordered the Cream of Crab Soup and an Ice Tea. It came up fast and service was friendly, but the soup was wayyyy over seasoned and the crab tasted dehydrated. Biting into crab chunks that seemed to break apart like powder chunks. I stopped trying to eat it after about 5 spoonfuls.   I drank about 2 large ice teas and 2 large waters to get the overpowering salty seasoning taste from my mouth. The unsweetened ice tea is good, yet not worth stopping in when there is a lot offered in this airport.   The worse part is the aftermath of a stomachache and sick feeling that lasted for the next 10-12 hours. If I wasn't already feeling tired and hungry, add sick to that and it wasn't worth it at all.    Even if you like canned crab, I wouldn't recommend Phillips for anyone.",

I did have the crab cake before at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson after another homesick tour, but it wasn't like being in Charm City, so opted for the special of the day, the Lobster Roll.  Baltimore is not exactly known for lobster, and an airport may not be the most authentic place, but the split top roll was decent, and while the lobster meat wasn't exactly fresh cracked from a Maine tail, more like it was frozen \"langostino \"(galatheid crab) from Chile, but there was plenty of it with some shredded romaine and a fairly zippy lemon and spiced mayo.  The bar service was attentive and as always at an airport there's plenty of bar company to be had for the lone traveler.  This restaurant seems to close earlier than most in the concourse and they were eagerly awaiting the remaining customers to get the hell out before 10pm.  They were pretty familiar with each other, maybe it might be a good idea to keep the conversations related to getting the customers out to themselves, you know we can hear you :)  The food was pretty good as was the service, very serviceable for an airport restaurant, does the hometown proud.",

The discshaped fried potatoes were edible. If you ask, you'll find out that draft beer is $8 and up. Wish I had read the other reviews before being fooled into thinking that real crabs were somewhere in the recent history of the kitchen.

All of a sudden a male waiter with short looking twists in his head starts laughing with another waitress and then they say \"yeah we're on the same page\" she yells out \"the last call for alcohol\" she looks at me and just laughs and walks by. I get up and walk over to her to see if they're closing soon and she says yes. I told her that it was very rude for the staff to just let me sit there and never tell me that they're about to close but just laugh because they're ready to get off and don't want to be in there working after 10 pm.

The soup: delicious. The salad: weird.  I think the salad had way too much going on and was unappetizing. I loved all components separately but together they do not work well.  My main issue is the price. While I can get past a bad salad, I can't get past a salad that was almost $20. Ridiculous. It was a huge portion, but a huge portion of nasty.",

The omelet was basically a severely overlooked hard egg pancake folded over unmelted Swiss cheese and some  sprinkles of what I'm guessing is their crab cake mixture.  The fruit was decaying and inedible. I told the waitress about the fruit just so she would know as those kind of things should be brought to the kitchen's attention and probably noticed by her before being served.  She was really nice and apologetic and offered to replace it with something else. I didn't want anything so no big deal. Then some guy comes over and asked what was wrong with the fruit. I asked don't you see?  He said no I don't see anything wrong.  Smh. At that point why waste my breath?  I simply replied we must have different standards, don't worry about it.  Scary that someone who may be a manager doesn't recognize decaying fruit.  Dude, strawberries aren't supposed to have black fur over gray spots. And blueberries aren't supposed to resemble wet raisins with open sores.   Another example of low Charlotte standards.",

    "text": "Stopped in at Phillips Seafood at CLT for breakfast while I was waiting for my flight back to ATL. This is a chain that I have seen in various airports but was never able to try. Well, I am glad that I had the chance today. The restaurant was right next to my gate so that was super convenient.  The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly, welcoming me as I entered. My server, Alison, was friendly and efficient. In a word, great! I ordered hot water with lemon to drink and I was pleased when I received substantial sized lemon slices. I hate receiving super thin lemon slices that you can barely get any juice from. For my meal, I ordered the crab meat omelet which came with potatoes, and wheat toast (Texas toast is also an option). Yum!!! The potatoes were crispy and flavorful, simply amazing. The omelet comes with what they call crabby sauce which I requested to have on the side since honestly the name didn't quite sit well with me. However, the sauce was actually pretty tasty and I ended up pouring over the omelet which was stuffed with backfin crab and Swiss cheese. Delish!  Food is is hot and flavorful. Prices are reasonable (my omelet was less than $11). If you are traveling through Charlotte or any other location that has a Phillips Seafood, I recommend you drop in for breakfast.",

OK it had some slightly limp Romaine as well as boxed croutons and some shreds of Parm but, the dressing...  First, since when does Caesar dressing come on the side?  Second, since when does it look and taste like bottled Kraft Italian!?!?  I also ordered a side of 4 fried shrimp. The menu described them as lightly hand dusted, etc but, these looked and tasted suspiciously like something the Gorton's fisherman hauled in and sold to Sea Pak.   Service was fast, friendly and efficient and also helps keep an A-OK rating intact. Overall, much too pricey for what you get quality-wise.",

Thank goodness I wasn't in a huge hurry to catch a flight. Service seemed lackadaisical at best. Sandwich was served hot and tasted good, but the \"side of fries\" only included about 5 waffle fries.

A queue was waiting at the hostess stand, but there were seats open at the bar, so I headed there. Same food, same drinks. Why not?  I just had a soda water (which he apologized after accidentally refilling with plain water) and a bowl of their excellent she crap soup. The soup was great and for airport food, reasonable at $9. A soda water (basically, Coke without the syrup), a bit expensive at $2.50.  Seafood tends to be expensive no matter where you are, and Phillips at CLT is no exception. But the service was good and it was nice to be in a proper sit down restaurant at an airport.",

I ordered a Cobb Salad with no bacon. 25 minutes later, the salad came with two sad looking pieces of bacon. It was taken away and 35 minutes later, the saddest looking salad reappeared. I tasted mostly minced eggs. I barely touched it. I read the reviews for the crab cakes so ordered an app. It was grease balls, not at all resembling a crab cake. 40.00 with tip and a soda water.",

This time through I started with a warming bowl of their Maryland crab soup which was creamy and smooth, but I wished it had more chunks of crab meat.  I always go for their crab cake dinner (I usually plump for the 2-cake option, but I'm trying to lose some of my own personal plump these days) and it was very good as usual.  Big pieces of lump meat, not much breading, the way a crab cake should be.  The accompanying cole slaw was mild and unassuming; and the waffle-cut fries were nice and crispy, flavored with Phillips Seafood seasoning.  A decent stop-off for lunch or dinner if you have enough time between connections.",

    "text": "My first experience with Phillips was in Washington, DC on the waterfront, well over five years ago. I then dined in, again, at the Baltimore location in the BWI airport. My most Yelp-able experience has been in the airport in Charlotte, thus far. I know, it's for an airport restaurant; but, my stomach is most vulnerable when traveling.   Layover - schmayover!!! That's how I felt one day last year when trying to head to Atlanta to visit one of my best friends. I was indeed hungry, and all of the coffee chains and grease-boxes that did not appeal to my palate got to hear the echo of my luggage wheels, as I rolled right past them. It's mid-morning - do I really want a cheese-steak sub or pizza? Methinksnot.... so, I head over to Phillips and do a \"what the hay\" kind of shrug, while surveying all of the empty tables sprawled across the floor.   I was greeted with southern pleasantries, that immediately reminded me of my future destination - as a warm smile spread across my face. I ordered the crab-cake w/ scrambled eggs, fruit and a biscuit! Yum.... I was satisfied with something so simple, yet superb. I could now care less if I had to wait in that airport for the next three hours. The staff was ultra-friendly, and the food was fresh (not unusual for this chain), so I give it four stars. If I'm ever in town again, meaning in the airport, I know where to eat.",

Unfortunately, I got the more aggressive one (the one who had no qualms about starting the argument right in front of the customer in the first place), who was quite pushy about trying to get me to order the most expensive items on the menu, appetizers, desserts, etc. (I was by myself at lunchtime) but took 15 minutes to bring me my drink order.

When I tried to take the plate and tell him to forget about exchanging it for the correct order he barked at me again! He then proceeded to yell at me from across the restaurant. He then told the cooks that it was his fault that he \"misunderstood\" my order and asked to correct it. I was so embarrassed and upset that I was crying at my table. He had the waitress bring me over my plate and said he was \"done\" to another waiter. I was so hurt! I couldn't believe I was being treated so badly!

Instead of an enjoyable experience, I was humiliated by this waiter in front of a busy restaurant. I wasn't even there for 20 minutes. I asked the waitress for a box. I paid for my food and left in tears. I left a message to the corporate office because I feel that as a customer I should not have been demeaned and ridiculed for your employee's mistake.

Delicious lumps of crab meat in a cream based soup with just a touch of Phillip's Seafood Seasoning to awaken my taste buds! I was only halfway done with the soup and I already wanted seconds --- it was THAT good. Must try the crab cakes on my next visit!!!

I've actually been to Phillips Seafood in the DC/Maryland area, so it was with great pleasure that I got to dine on their delicious crab cakes and crab soup while at the airport.  Of course, being in an airport, there's not much to say about ambiance.  It is loud and crowded, but that is to be expected.  Servers are consistently quick and pleasant.  The food is always great.  It is a bit on the high priced side, but you (or in my case, my company) are paying for quality seafood.  Can't wait for my next trip back to Charlotte.",

I asked for my tuna to be cooked medium, explicitly said slightly pink inside, it came well done and I chose not to wait for a redo. Quality of tuna re: taste was a 2/5. I was hungry, ate it anyway. Veggies on plate boring but Colleen did offer some lemon. Environment loud with music, can't hear TVs. I wouldn't rush back here, just average, at best.",

Instead, I got weakness, though I will give points for a good crab soup (though I didn't eat too much, it was a little much). I was a little bummed to not be getting to take advantage of the brunch dishes, they had crab omelettes on the menu and I have had some good ones in the past that I would have loved to see if they measured up (doubt they woulda though)",

I ordered the cinnamon French toast with bacon. The bacon was not fresh. I felt as if they cooked all the bacon hours before and then kept it under a heater and just served it when someone ordered it. Definitely not made to order.   The French toast was a big disappointment because I never knew anyone could mess up french toast this bad. Actually I think they just gave us cinnamon flavored bread and called French toast with fruit on top and sugar powder.   As for the veggie omelette that I added bacon to it. That was the only decent item I consumed despite the hard bacon. The worst part is, it came with wheat toast and they only give you one piece of toast cut in half. When did restaurants start giving one piece of toast? On top of that the toast was stale. The home fries were cold and tasteless and I wouldn't even recommend hot tea. Just get a simple orange juice and save your troubles.",

The menu wasn't extensive and it was pretty pricey.  Options included a handful of appetizers, salads, sandwiches/burger, and entrees.  I ordered the angus burger and the seafood sampler appetizer.  The burger was really greasy, but delicious.  The  bread got really soggy from all of the grease that was on the plate.  It came with a tiny handful of waffle fries and a sliced pickle.  The seafood sampler was my favorite.  Sampler came with 3 little crab balls, 5 fried shrimp, and 5oz of calamari.  Everything was fried perfectly and well seasoned. The crab weren't dry at all and was delicious.  There were also 3 dipping sauces that were provided: tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, and sweet thai chili sauce.   Service was great.  i guess I came at the right time as I read how slow it can get.  The waitress was kind and attentive and my food arrived about 10 mins after I ordered.  Tables had ketchup, salt/pepper/ and old bay seasoning just incase you wanted more.",

    "text": "Phillips Seafood is just one of a few handfuls of regional restaurants located in Charlotte airport that make this airport such a pleasure to fly through, as the food options here are such a welcome departure from the standard McDonalds and Sbarro (indeed, with the varied food options, free wifi, restroom attendants, live piano music and comfy rocking chairs, CLT is the only airport to which I've given a solid 5 stars).  I stopped at this restaurant to grab a quick bite during a 1 1/2 hour layover.  I had a seat at the bar and was quickly attended to by Angela. She asked what I wanted, I requested a menu and she grabbed one from the next customer over and handed it to me. Lol.  I ordered a 9 oz pour of Chardonnay and an order of miniature crab cakes with chipotle ranch dressing.  She sat out a wine glass and proceeded to dump (I mean that literally) a full and generous 9 ounce pour into it. She was awesome all night and I loved her personality!    Chardonnay was $12/ glass and the crab cakes were $10.99 which was fair, especially for airport fare which can be pricey in some cities due to the ol' \"supply and demand\" rule.   The crab cakes were tasty, but the ranch was a bit overpowering and the bed of lettuce the crab cakes were served on was a little brown and wilted.  It should be noted that, while they had ceramic plates, patrons are given black plastic forks and knives to dine with.  This Phillips Seafood location has 1 TV on each end of the bar and a few hanging in other areas of the restaurant, but on this night they had the same programming on all of them and the channel selection wasn't the best.",

Get me lit up first, then I can enjoy the unenjoyable. Beer goggles for food is what you need. But that would never work for the likes of Burger King - it does work for Phillips.   So I had some kind of fish sandwich with a decent mayo/tarter sauce and slaw. A sit down meal. But I would have liked an oyster poboy. Put it on the menu, dudes. And keep that A/C on.",

For the same price I would have paid for a sandwich elsewhere, I got one of the best omelettes I've ever had in my life! It was very big, and filled with delicious crab meat and cheese; it was amazing. It also came with a generous side of potatoes and toast. Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of time, so I had to ask the server/bartender to move everything from the plate to a to-go box, so there was no time to take a pic...but I will seek it out any time I am in the Charlotte airport again! I am surprised at all the negative reviews because the service I received was exceptional, and everyone else there seemed to be enjoying it, too. I highly recommend breakfast at Phillip's Seafood!",

I stopped into this Phillips since I've had decent experiences in other airports, and they are very accommodating of my substitution requests (no potatoes, bread, thank you very much).  The food was good, the coffee was black and always kept warm.  Here's the outstanding part:  I tried paying, and i had some issue with my card. It would absolutely not go through, and there was nothing I could do. I didn't have cash or another credit card. Yikes!!!!  The manager came over and just very kindly told me that he would take care of it.  And that I didn't need to pay.  WHAT??!! Amazing!  I got their address so I can send not only the tab, but I will be sending some flowers or gifts, and especially tip my waitress since I jipped her with my not-paying-ness.

    "text": "Airport food with less than great service.   I wasn't expecting much from this place but the really slow, inconsistent service was extremely frustrating. Our waitress never came by to check in or move us along, it took multiple waves at any body who would make eye contact with us to get our drinks, orders, and check. And then reminders when these requests took too long.   The food on the menu is almost all fried and greasy. I was optimistic about the fish and chips but the fried fish was not crisp or savory, but old and (again) overly greasy. The crab cakes on the appetizer was reasonably good but super small on my friend's entree. Sticking point for me is the high price point for mediocre food. Even at an airport you can find a better choice for your pre-flight meal.",

The service was good, the server was kind and attentive, I ordered a beer and crab cake sandwich which comes with waffle fries and pickles.   It was  disappointing to say the least. The fries were extra oily to the point where oil was squeezing out from the fries at each bite.  The crab cake itself was okay , but the bread was really plain. Overall a sub par meal..   Also it is extremely expensive. Like 10 dollars for one beer expensive, I guess that is the standard inside airports but I can't help but be outraged",

Have you ever gotten your heat broken eating at an airport restaurant that wasn't as good as it's outside counterpart and costed twice as much? Yeah....me too.   Kinda long winded on this one. Have no idea whether or not this place has one on the outside but I'm sure they do. I'm not going to complain too much about the pricing. All airport restaurant prices are high because they know they have you held hostage and most likely, you'll be willing to pay anything.  Man.....what a lot of rambling. Ok, to the point. To the chain, my two star may be a little unfair. New England style seafood and southern calabash style are way different so I may be a little biased because of that. We stopped in here because I didn't know which style this place is but, when we got a table that wasn't too crowded, we decided to stay.   The crab cake was good but as I said, really expensive. Usually, when I pay $20 for a crab cake, I have waiter standing by to brush the crumbs off the table cloth. For the main meal, I got the fish and chips. Not bad, not great, but served it's purpose.   Anyway, that's about it. Most yankees would probably like this place. Most southerners would probably prefer a different one. Whatever, it's an airport restaurant. Deal with it.",

I get it men like to stare at woman but when a bunch of cooks come out to look at you and all huddle around, it gets a bit annoying. My food (fish and chips) took about 2 minutes to come. It looked disgusting and was cold and soggy. I did not want to eat it immediately when the server dropped it off. Then this is where it gets good! Colleen the so called manager of the place comes over and asks me why I don't like it so I told her. She replies well we make these constantly so the cooks just keep making them and this one must of sat to long. DISGUSTING! Don't ever tell that to a guest in a restaurant! Also I informed her that her cooks were hovering near me and staring at me, Colleen replies \"Well maybe it's because your so pretty\" my mouth dropped and I left immediately.

But the food... let's be real: you're in an airport. You can jack the prices as much as you want, but all that fish and shrimp is being flown in frozen boxes from China, let's not kid ourselves, kids... It's totally \"meh.\" But go get a beer at the bar, it's lively, and you will get entertaining stories from the staff if you're just NICE... and please - just be fucking NICE, ok?! Why would you ever be a dick to someone who's bringing you alcohol? I really don't get our species... sigh.",

    "text": "My friend and I swung by Phillip's for a quick bite while our plane made a stop in Charlotte (our gate was right next to the restaurant). It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.  You're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high. I'd probably stop by if I wanted something other than standard fast food in the airport, but there's not much any other reason to come by here.",

    "text": "They say you can truly judge a city by its airport and in that case Charlotte is truly the Quern City! I had a ton of airline miles burning a hole in my Expedia account and vicious thirst for out of town tang I read about in dirtyR4R so I scrappled some funds from the pile I've been saving to record my next EP \"eyes without a phase\" (it's a fully formed concept album inspired by moon and it's many shapes and how they correlate to the shapes of the heart and moods. It's really deep and will be up on cdbaby once I get back to singing weight.) anyway I used some money to pay the 9/11 fees (proud to) and taxes (middle finger emoji) and Charlotte was the cheapeast destination so I doubled down on it.  I don't know crap about the south other than the fact it's cool to make dogs fight each other to the death here and they say Hardee's instead of whataburger. I also knew from reading dirtyR4R that girls in the south like to go \"jowling\" and I liked the idea of that because I assume it involves a pigs mouth.  So I got here and I was blown way by how futuristc the airport was: one side of as all planes with propellers and you can walk on the concrete to them and there's just a little paper sign with your airport code on it so you can literally jump on any place you feel like if you like going to places like mobile or destin; the other side about a half a mile away is full of starbuckses and bojangles and Wolfgang puck salad carts that you ride a moving sidewalk to. People are just lounging around in rocking chairs all over the place grooving to the sweet Carolina sounds of fat and old people not paying attention to one another while handling rolling luggage.  After my twenty minute journey inside I'd worked up a hunger and found this place.  I went straight to the D.  chickenDinner.  Which is what you want to order to truly appreciate a place with the word \"Crab\" in its name. I ordered a batch of Rosemary chicken tenders and said \"take your time honeypies, I'm a man who writes reviews on the Internet for free so a website can exploit that for brand presence and monetary gain.\" Away they went charging me a totally acceptable $11 for three pieces of chicken. In roughly 8 minutes I'd received my meal.  Lightning fast. In fact, I think it's the quickest I've ever received a meal at a fancy sitdown place. Romano's you're on notice.  It was boxed up to go even though I hadn't requested it that way and they started closing door around me so I sat on the floor outside, a man of the people, ready to take in my feast.  I opened the container to reveal my fried tenders. They were shiny and covered in shavings of some sort of cheese that either couldn't, didn't, or had lost the will to melt. BONUS.  I tore one scalding hot tender open to reveal the white meaty flesh and dipped it into the ranch cup... Bliss.  It was like eating a spoonful of old olive oil that had grown a texture. It smelled like old olive oil that was left in a pan and used by your roommate Quinez to reheat eggs. The oils soaked deep into the styrofoam and began to pool on the carpet that I was also using as a napkin. Fearful I may lose the True TASTE OF THE CAROLINAS I hoovered those strips, enjoying each bite. People forget that the most important thing about fried chicken is getting that oil taste to totally cover the boring flavors of chicken, batter, seasonings, and even the dipper sauce.  When I awoke it was Sunday the 7th. I had been asleep in front of the crab sign for four and a half days. My shoes were missing but there was $18 in the top half of my styrofoam container and a bowl of ants and millipedes where my chicken platter once girthed.  I scooped out the money for fees on my return Expedia flight to the city. I was sad I didn't get any while in Charlotte but I don't think the ladies here would appreciate a delicate sensitive lover like myself who's hands and tongue are still just a little bit slicker than the average joe with shoes on.",

We figured that a place clearly proclaiming both seafood and salads might serve something besides deep fried garbage. Sure enough, they had the odd salad and grilled fish on the menu.  Perhaps some person at the restaurant picked up that two ravenous travelers leaving behind half eaten plates means the food is barely edible. But based on how the hostess seemed clueless to the massive bags in the aisles (hey, it is in an airport) as she led weary passengers zig-zagging through an airport version of American Ninja, I'm guessing paying attention isn't something they do well here.  By the way, making food also isn't something they do well here. My grilled fish, really a simple enough dish, was rank with fishiness probably from sitting out for too long or just not being very fresh. The salad had limp lettuce turning brown at the edges, probably from one of those bags of pre-cut greens being opened a while ago. The veggies were die-cut thawed frozen veggies with a pat of butter thrown on them.  Really gross.",

I asked the 3rd server if they saw any dressing. They said they would give me some more. More implies there was some to begin with. They arrived with a plastic ramekin and slid it on the table. At that point decided I wasn't going to pay $16 for it. I eat out several times a week and have never sent food back. They said \"no problem \" and printed a bill for my wine. Never was I asked if I wanted something else. No manager came by to make it right. Actually the place had the appearance of no one in charge.

I'd recommend that soup even if it is pricey, but hey it's an airport.   Lobster roll was awful. Fortunately waitress took it off my bill -- and offered a cup of water to go(!). Unfortunately I didn't get to eat more than two bites. I lived in Maine and this is not a Maine lobster roll. It is ground up seafood saturated in fat on a proper toasted hot dog bun. It tastes horrid.  Next time I plan to high tail it over to Bojangles in concourse B.",

My shrimp salad with pecans, Gorgonzola and dried cranberries came with 11 pieces of deep dried shrimp coated in a sweet and spicy glaze (kind of Thai), not bad but too sweet for me.  To his credit the waiter made sure I liked spicy food when I ordered and it did have a kick.  It came on a bed of lettuce but nothing else--no pecans, Gorgonzola or dried cranberries.  I realized this after I ate half the salad and had to remind the waiter to go get some.  It left me wondering if he also left the soup on the counter and let it get cold before delivering to my table.   Unremarkable food and unremarkable service.

Decorated with tin, you get the feeling you are on the banks of the Atlantic Ocean at a fisherman's wharf.  Phillips' specialty is the Lobster roll. The lobster roll is chunks of lobster served on a toasted bun with a light butter sauce. It comes with waffle fries in a tall plastic cup.  You need a little salt and pepper on your lobster roll and then you are ready to get down!  I would also like to add that my waitress was super awesome and got me in and out of there in 15 minutes today!  It took about 10 minutes to make my lunch and 5 for me to wolf it down.   Thank you super awesome waitress!    This decadent lunch is sinful, but well worth the guilt of paying $20 for lunch only to pack on the kind of calories one should eat at dinner.",

I went back a couple of weeks ago and they were light on the lobster and fries this time, my waitress offered to take it back, but I didn't have time so I just ate what I got. Today I had 6 fries and 3 small pieces of lobster on both rolls, when I ask the bartender if she thought that was worth $20 she snatched it up and said order something else then.

    "text": "First off I respect this place for serving Bloody Marys' and mimosas so early in the morning everyday. I think they have an understanding that brunch isn't only reserved for Sundays.   They serve breakfast here until 10 am. So don't be fooled by the exterior signage. I had to actually glance at someone plate as I walked by and noticed eggs! I was delighted to see that they had breakfast!!  For my fellow vegetarians: there is a veggie omelet option comes with broccoli, peppers and I believe cheese.   If you order coffee... You can get refills! You know you need it if you got up at 4:30 a.m. To get in a flight at 5:45 a.m. Get your caffeine up ladies and gents!   The service here is friendly and the pricing is decent and by that I mean it's about $10 a plate.",

    "text": "I'm a real foodie but have never had a lobster roll. While on a layover in Charlotte, I was excited to see this on the menu board outside of Phillips, so we dropped in for a few drinks and dinner. The service was friendly, but a little slow (overwhelmed I think). The lobster roll was okay, but the fries were better. They just needed a little more seasoning, which is available right there on the table, so no biggie. My only real complaint was the drink prices. Holy moly! Don't say yes to \" Wanna make that a double?\" They're only referring to the price, not the amount of alcohol in the drink.",

Dried out and not sure it was lobster. I should have gone to Burger King like i originally thought. Maybe their other menu items are better? Service was prompt. DONT get the I think it was LOBSTER ROLL!",

They were right next to where i had to wait for my next flight, so it was a no brainer and a nice treat. Some people took their food to go. Lots of angry faces when they took out their food.  Lol !",
