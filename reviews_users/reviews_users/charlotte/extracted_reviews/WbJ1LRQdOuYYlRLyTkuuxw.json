We sat near an open kitchen(some would find this to be a negative but not us) that allowed us to see many of the fabulous options before we made our decisions. Chef Justin F. (friendly and engaging) was more than happy to answer all of our questions about the various plates being delivered to other tables. I decided on the Shrimp and grits......it was amazing!!! Truly a slice of heaven in a bowl!! I can't wait until next week so I can try something else! Great staff, great food! This is our new sunday ritual!!!",

THC has got a nice/hipster/upscale country-diner feel to it. There are a lot of free-range and organic and gluten-free options on the menu (see hipster feel above)(they even carry Omission beer, for (1) those w gluten allergies and (2) those who don't understand gluten but avoid it anyway). But the food really is good. The blueberry jam (w biscuits), the fried shrimp (w basil and spicy aioli), and  the FRIED OKRA were my favorites. Part of the price is the organic, free-range, hormone-free thing, another part is the location. Portion size does help in this department though, you will have lunch for the next day. Also, I noticed they have $2 pints on Mondays, which is a decent deal for CLT.",

They also give you complimentary biscuits with their honey and homemade blueberry jam.. Ah-mazing. Not only was the food good but the hospitality there was nothing I have ever experienced. Our waiter, Jonathan was so personable and so nice. He gave us suggestions on the menu and when we told him we were new to Charlotte, he gave us so many suggestions on the best places to go in town.

Cons- the specialty drinks are tiny and very pricey (but tasted ok), the black bean burger did not have much flavor, had to request the biscuits before our meal and the service was very slow.

Biscuits brought to the table like breadsticks or chips made our party of four oh so happy before digging into our filling meals. I am glad I ordered the flounder, but the fried chicken will most certainly be ordered on a return visit. Hushpuppies are an obvious choice for a side and while the mac n cheese wasn't anything extraordinary, it did hit the spot. Options for my vegetarian friend and the salad options were serious, although probably not that healthy. I liked the decorations and well-appointed bathroom. The service was great and parking easy, although we were there on the earlier side of the dinner rush at 6:15pm.  I would like to go back to try their $6 Monday special on Shoo Mercy Burgers or $3 Taco Tuesdays and some may like the $10 bottomless mac-n-cheese on Wednesdays, but I believe they have already changed their menu, so keep an eye on their evolution. Haberdish over in NoDa is all the rage right now, but if you want a similar southern food staple experience, go enjoy the winning formula at Tupelo Honey Cafe.",

The salad that on of our colleagues for was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all. the steak was extremely dry. I got the grits and scallops and that was okay.

    "text": "I wish zero stars was an option. I called Tupelo Honey to see if they did bottomless mimosas, the hostess on the phone assured me they did, and continued to confirm my 21st birthday reservation. I was very excited to be a guest, as I have always drove past Tupelo Honey & heard many good things about it. I arrived, and told my server, Matt, that I was starving. He quickly suggested we get the crispy brussels sprouts because they come out quickly. We agreed, and Matt left and returned with the brussels maybe less than a minute later. The brussels were overcooked, unseasoned and cold. How can something be overcooked AND cold? Theres no way they were made to order. My server brought me old, cold Brussels. And for a place describing itself as \"new southern flavors\", the cold ranch dressing that came with them on the side was metiocre at best. I was famished so I ate them anyway.  It was a rocky start to say the least. Matt soon after brought us a bowl of biscuits with jam on the side, told me he didn't want me to starve. I love when my servers take the initiative like that, totally made up for the so-so brussels.   Later, we ordered our entrees. My friend ordered a chicken Cobb salad, and I let Matt order for me. I always do that when I go to new restaurants-it allows me to see what real flavors/originality the kitchen is capable of, as well as allows me to have a culinary connection with my server. It also gives my server the opportunity to make my bill higher. Matt told us that the new menu was a week old, so I was excited to try something new! He asked me if there were any dietary restrictions he should be aware of, and I told him I don't eat pork-so no bacon or ham. He did not write our order down.  Food comes out, my friend's salad was like 80% lettuce. Very little toppings. Matt tells me that he ordered me a \"Biscuits. Gravy. Chicken.\" ....So, he brought me a bowl that consisted of the biscuits that I had just finished eating, and was garnished with bacon bits. After I specifically told him I don't eat pork. And to top it all off, it was freezing cold.  It was my 21st birthday for crying out loud.   I told Matt about it, sent it back, and asked for a menu. \"I'll just order for myself\", I said. Matt came back and said he can remake the bowl. No Matt. I don't want a remake of the cold bowl with biscuits I had just eaten. I'll pass. So I started looking over the menu and Matt came back and said \"Avocado toast might be good.\"  What poor salesmanship. I don't want something \"that might be good.\" But I was tired of looking over the menu, so I agreed to his suggestion.  Matt never, NEVER, apologized for giving me a pork covered bowl to begin with.  My friend's chicken on her Cobb salad got cold while we were waiting for my remake to come out. Never did he offer to replace her food. My plate finally comes out, my eggs were cooked to perfection, an awesome medium cooked egg. The avocado toast was just that-some bread with avocado on top. No originality, no twist on southern flavors. Bland. In the middle was an undressed salad with ONE carrot slice and two watermelon radish slices on top. All I could think was what a pathetic attempt this was at a breakfast plate. So not worth it-I could make that at home.   I was no longer interested in communicating my dissatisfaction with Matt. He didn't care, clearly. I was waiting for a manager to perform a table touch at my table, which never happened. I thought it was standard for a manager to come by when food gets sent back...but not at Tupelo Honey, apparently. My friend and I looked around and understood why this experience was happening. There were servers not wearing non slip shoes, a server walking around (indoors) with a pair of yellow sunglasses, servers with their hair down, fooling around, playing, etc...It was in such disarray. Such disorganization. There is clearly noone setting the example at Tupelo, no real leader in charge. It's a dumping ground where half-ass employees come and put in minimal effort.  I never told Matt what our reason was for visiting, I assumed the hostess would've communicated that to him, and that a birthday cake or something would come out at the end of my meal. It should be a huge priority for hostesses too communicate special occassions to servers. But alas, no cake. No well wishes. Not even an inquiry of why we were visiting. Every department in Tupelo failed me.  I will forever be ashamed that I wasted some of my 21st birthDAY at a place as pathetic as Tupelo Honey. The hostesses didn't communicate our occasion. The server didn't write our order down, thus brought incorrect food. Did not apologize. Was not personable. Kitchen served me cold, bland food. Twice. Never did we see a manager on the floor.  0/10, will forever advise people to go somewhere OTHER than Tupelo Honey.",

We ordered 2 Tito's Bloody Marys...they were pretty good but they should be for being over $26 bucks. Sort of crazy lol. $9 for the Tito's which is fine but then another $3.25 for the Bloody Mary. Way over the top in my opinion. Anyway to sum it up 3stars 4stars for food 2stars for service and Who knows for the Bloody Mary's lol FYI have your drinks at home before you get there",

Everyone made us feel very welcomed and had such great hospitality. We had fried green tomatoes, which were delicious, and our main dish was the Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes which was to die for.

Friends' feedback:The macaroni was not as good as people describe it;shrimp and grits were good but they have had better;trout met expectations   Overall,I will visit the Tupelo Honey Cafe again and try the brunch next time.",

While we were looking at the menu she asked if we had questions - and she was able to answer them all and seemed honest about her responses. It was happy hour, so I ended up getting a martini to drink. For my entree I ordered the iron steak with brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes as the sides.  The biscuits are my favorite part of the meal! They are homemade and still warm when served. They come with a side of homemade blackberry jam and honey. THEY ARE AMAZING! If they had all you can eat biscuits, I would be there in a heartbeat!  For the entree, it was delicious as well! The steak had a pepper sauce on it - although it was not really saucey, but it was still pretty good. Had a little heat to it, but they did a light 'sauce' so it was perfect! The steak was cooked absolutely perfect - medium, of course. I am not a huge fan of brussels, but they were actually good! Plus they mixed the fingerling potatoes with the brussels. The potatoes was cooked perfectly, and seasoned to perfection!  I was beyond full after eating the large portion they consider dinner, and did not get a dessert.  I am excited to keep coming back here!",

    "text": "Came here for brunch on a Saturday at 1130. Had made a reservation, the hostess said they were running behind so we stepped into the bar. Bar service was terrible, they did not look our way the entire 10 minutes we stood there. There was a pair of girls hovering as well and they did not get served either. This is disappointing because to me it is a key tenet of a boozy brunch spot as it is easy to go elsewhere especially in brewery happy south end Charlotte. Thankfully we were sat shortly after, and service was great (aside for the 10 minute wait for drinks to return- really my only negative).   Ordered the violet beauregard champagne cocktail; was a great first drink, sweet, but also the right amount of boozy. The rest of the table had Megamosas and Bloody Mary's, everyone was content.   Was very excited to hear house-made biscuits were coming out, they were very salty which was strange. But slathered in jam and honey they were delicious. Not sure if the salt got tipped in extra or if that is the norm but I was confused.  I got the Eggs Betty. I'm a sucker for eggs Benedict and they did not disappoint. However, I've definitely had better and would go for a more traditional \"southern\" breakfast if I were to return. The potato cracklins were great, and would make sure to at least get a side of these if they were not part of my meal. A highlight was the blackberry jalapeno pulled pork burger- would recommend.   All in all it's a great spot with a big patio as well- we came on a dreary day or would definitely be a great place to be on a nice day. Just hope they hire more bartenders to keep the crowd happy!",

They close at 10pm on Saturday nights which is a bit early and they locked the door at 9:58pm when I was there when I tried to go to the ladies room before leaving. 300 East Restaurant is around the corner and is a comparable restaurant for less money.   PROS: Good food quality, nice outside deck, convenient location and parking CONS: Price and early closing time",

The fried green tomatoes tasted like a warmed tomato wrapped in breading instead of a fried tomato. This was literally the first time I've ever not finished FGTs from any restaurant. My wife's fried chicken was moist but the pimento cheese over powered the dish in a bad way. I had the shrimp and grits (same dish I got in Greenville) but they were not good. Also the first time I haven't finished a serving of shrimp and grits from any restaurant. We won't be back.",

I am very happy that we did because our server, Calvin, was fantastic. He was very attentive and had really great menu suggestions. My two friends and I were having a really hard time deciding on what to get so we decided to split three items. We split the Blueberry Pain Perdu, Famous Sweet Potato Pancake, and the Genuine Country Breakfast with over-easy eggs sausage, and potato cracklins.   The Blueberry Pain is sweet. I definitely could not have eaten a full plate of them, but as a portion of my breakfast it was perfect. The Sweet Potato pancake was also delicious. It actually inspired me to look up sweet potato pancake recipes when i got home. Basically i want to have this for breakfast every day. It was fantastic but again super sweet so consider splitting this with someone. For the genuine country breakfast please see my review above. It is a classic for a reason.",

Their brunch is excellent, but it does get busy so expect a wait.  I went this past week for dinner and had such a great experience. William (our waiter) was attentive and did a fantastic job. The restaurant was very slow for dinner time, but the dinner menu is different than their brunch menu so it was nice to see the different options available. I got the Pear Salad which was so fresh and an interesting combination of flavors.   Tupelo is a stable, if you're passing through Charlotte, you should stop in. If you live in Charlotte and haven't been yet, you're making a mistake.",

Every meal is kicked off with fresh outta the oven biscuits served with fresh blueberry preserves and Tupelo honey (this is mostly the reason by I insist on coming here!) They kick my grandma's biscuit's outta the water (sorry, Grandma, but you need to step your game up!)  Top picks: If you have never tried chicken & pancakes, or if you love it: their's are top notch. If you are really up for a challenge, try eating the entire meal... I don't think it can be done. The Shoo Mercy Pancake consists of 2 heaping flapjacks topped with  buttermilk fried chicken, maple-peppered bacon and 100% maple syrup.   I also am a big fan of the Tupelo Farm Fresh Cheeseburger consisting of pasture-raised Black Angus beef served with aged Wisconsin cheddar, lettuce, onions, house-made pickles and Chef Brian's special sauce. I like to accompany my burger with shaved brussels sprouts salad with honey vinaigrette and baked mac 'n cheese.   Also, be sure to sign up for their email club and get a Tupelo Honey pint glass!",

He was attentive on a morning where we had to wait an hour and just completely made our experience. He is the reason people should be servers and any place would be lucky to have him.

I have never been a fan of chicken with breakfast foods but this experience has completely changed my mind. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It also seemed to have a slight honey taste which was the perfect accompaniment and made this chicken absolutely heavenly. My boyfriend got the omelet and the waiter was not joking when he said this would be plenty to eat without needing a side! It was HUGE!! We both were pleasantly stuffed when we finished eating.  The drinks were also quite tasty! The giant mimosa was plenty to drink and not too strong. Exactly what I was hoping for on a Saturday morning. My boyfriend got their special huge bloody mary that was made with yellow tomatoes. Now I am not usually a fan of bloody marys but this was actually really good! It had a different taste than a traditional bloody mary which I liked and he said it was the best bloody mary he has ever tasted, and he is a regular fan. He did say he wasn't sure it was quite worth the $15 but it was his birthday so it was a nice treat.  As much as I have raved about the food, I also can't say enough good things about the overall environment and wait staff. Our waiter made us feel extremely comfortable and really went over the menu since it was our first time. He made us feel special with the biscuits and provided recommendations on menu items. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be really happy and enjoying their experience as well.  This has officially become our most favorite brunch spot!",

Second round of Madame Beauregarde - Blueberry-Basil Martini had no garnishes was the color was downright scary - a pepto pink. The first Mojito Du Jour was delicious and refreshing but the second one was served in a much smaller glass and had the same tinge of pepto pink as the second Madame Beauregarde. The food was ok. The fried green tomatoes were obviously out of season but grits were divine. The portion of the Pimento Cheese Nachos was just enough to make you hangry. The biscuits were fantastic and the blueberry compote so amazing my BIL bought a jar. My salad was good, hard to mess up a bowl of lettuce. The fried chicken on top was tasty. Biggest complaint however was lack of clean up after appetizers and two rounds of beverages. Of all the restaurants in Charlotte it will be awhile before I will head here again - hopefully things will improve.",

The blue berry preserves were by far the highlight of the meal. My husband even put it on his omelet. The dining area was fairly loud, and a little difficult to hear even the people at your table. The waiting area was outside and shady, which was a plus as they were packed for Saturday afternoon brunch. Overall we enjoyed our experience and would go back if we are ever back in Charlotte.",

We had and INCREDIBLE server, Jonathan, who made us feel right at home. He was so friendly and went above and beyond to make our experience wonderful (my mother has an allergy to certain things and right away he knew exactly what was okay for her and what wasn't.)  Having 2 young children and an allergy at a table, you'd think we would be a burden, but Jonathan was so friendly and fun. We really enjoyed the service.  So let's talk food... everything was incredible. We had the goat cheese and the okra for an appetizer (and of course their biscuits are life), ALL amazing! Our kids enjoyed the macaroni and cheese, potatoes, and the corn souffle(outstanding) I had the super breakfast bowl (perfect), my husband had the wicked chicken sandwich and my mother had the scarlet beet salad. Everything again, was just outstanding and we can't wait to come back. Oh yea! The cocktails we insanely delicious as well. 2 thumbs up we will be back! Thanks again Jonathan!!!",

Then we shared some crispy Brussels and fried picked- which were perfect I must admit. The biscuits they supplied where hot and fresh- the blueberry jam and honey toppings were refreshing. I grabbed their lunch deal for $13 which include half a sandwich, salad, and soup/fry option. I would definitely go back and would recommend.",

The brick building was a for sure sign of a rustic and traditional style experience, waiting to show me what Charlotte has to offer on a plate.  The staff was hospitable and friendly (I'm noticing this is definitely a Chatlotte staple) and seating was fast. Surprisingly, every seat was the best seat because there was so much to notice about the atmosphere. Plenty of old charm decorations to captivate the eye and each probably carried a story of it's own. I wonder what those windows and doors hanging on the wall have seen. Maybe this is a restaurant inside an art museum? Either way, I knew I wouldn't be dissapointed with all the reviews on the food, I previously read about. Sometimes, you get to a place and you just know, ya know?  We decided to order Fried Green Tomatoes on grits with goat cheese, Crispy Brussell sprouts with lemon, blackened catfish, fried chicken with mashed potatoes, southern omelet with chorizo and sweet potato pancakes. Can't forget the complimentary biscuits with blueberry jam and honey. Dang, I'm hungry all over again.  Completely satisfied with this and I wouldn't call it brunch, it was an experience.",

I really wanted some fried chicken but they only breast and that just doesn't work.  The double IPA \"Babymaker\" was nice n sweet like an Imperial should be.  I usually drink the traditional IPA, but some wack job brainiac decided to start criticizing the IPAs and that aggression will not stand.  So instead of risking unsatisfaction, I thought that was a safe choice. Overall, a solid place and I feel obligated as a result, to rank it a 4; but I honestly didn't feel it was much more than a high 3.  I know this will sound like a despicable hipster thing, but It just didn't have something . . . maybe that was due to my disappointment in not offering proper (yeah I'm a snob) fried chicken.

If you do want to try an app I suggest the *fried green tomatoes*, served on goat cheese grits. I know Grits don't sound good but trust me these are.   They have daily drink specials and appetizer specials every day for their \"happy hour\" 4-6. Apps served like $4.50 each or so, basically just have the size of the normal app.   Yummy breakfast & dinner.",

The chicken was very crispy and tender. The shrimp was savory.  If you check in on Yelp, you get a 10% discount!

    "text": "There is a Tupelo Honey restaurant in Knoxville, TN that is one of my favorites. This Charlotte one just fell short of my expectations. We went on Friday night around 6:30-7:00pm, and the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. That was our first clue.  The food we ordered was just okay. The brussel sprouts and hominy was ruined by the overpowering horseradish taste, the macaroni and cheese was very dry, and the biscuits weren't warm. The trout and blackened catfish we ordered were good, but the best item was the fried green tomatoes appetizer. We ordered water and the bill was over $70 with tip for 2 people. I don't think we'll be back to this location.",

I ordered two entrees because I felt the pecan pie French toast wasn't going to be enough by itself. It. Was. SO. GOOD! I would totally order it again. The mountain harvest bowl is great for those that are health conscious. It has a very unique taste. The negatives would be that I dislike that items aren't \"meals\" & you have to order al la Carte or an additional entree to get enough food. It just felt weird to order French toast but itself & that's it. My other negative was having to wait so long to get additional mimosas. I felt I could have gotten my money's worth & ordered more.",

There was about a 45 min wait due to the brunch rush so my boyfriend & I ordered mimosas while we waited, which were great. The outdoor seating area is super comfortable so the wait didn't feel long. We got outdoor seating which was really nice. I ordered the pecan pie french toast with one scrambled egg which was amazing! I love that it had plenty of flavor but was not too sweet. My boyfriend ordered the chicken & biscuits which was also very good. He had a passion fruit cocktail which I would definitely recommend! Overall, we had a great brunch.",

The cocktails were very good and the food was also delicious. I think the food was specific to the event, but they had chorizo and pimento cheese nachos, bbq pulled pork biscuits, and mini pecan pie cups. For some reason they thought it was a good idea to serve a hot drink in a copper Moscow mule cup (which conducts heat), so you burned yourself if you touched the cup and the drink never cooled down to be able to take more than a sip. Overall, it was a great event and I'll be coming back to check out their dinner menu!",

I ordered sweet potato pancakes & I loved those (which came with bacon, fried chicken breast, and eggs & this was \"ehh okay\") but I think it was worth about $15 opposed to the $21 it cost.

However, I think my time eating here for brunch is over, considering the food has gotten worse with each visit.  My favorite item has always been the sweet potato pancakes they used to be the size of a plate with butter and candied pecans on top you would never need syrup... not the case any more I got the short stack and bacon and it came with two four inch pancakes with no butter and were probably some of the worst pancakes I've had.  My boyfriend got the fried chicken BLT with a side of chili. The chili was enough for three bites and the chicken sandwich was dry and was missing the tomato.  I would not waste your time waiting on a table at this place, what used to be a great southern experience is now just an overpriced diner. There are a lot better options in Charlotte for brunch.",

We didn't get our food until I went up to the hostess and asked about it and this was after waiting 45 mins. When the food came, it was not hot and not even lukewarm. 2 of us ordered the fried chicken with the 'bee dust' and it was very dry. 1 of the people in our group ordered the roast chicken and it was also dry. None of the food on our table was hot when it came out. Our server only came and checked on us once while we were waiting for our food (1 more time to deliver a plate of appetizer for someone in our group). The restaurant was not even busy on this Monday night! What horrible service and food! Would not recommend anyone coming here.",

We live in TX. But we just searched yelp and found another review an decided to try it out. We were so pleased with our dinner. We had the fried green tomatoes, and the sweet potato pancakes with the Tupelo honey beer. Also we sat on the patio. It was a great way to celebrate. I have been thinking about those tomatoes most days since. I really wanted to try the beet salad too but I was just too full. Super yummy. Get the banana pudding for dessert. Oh also! Our server Destiny was clearly not only serving our table, but our service was perfect and personal. She didn't miss a beat and we felt spoiled by her attentiveness.",

We love the outdoor area which faces flowering crepe myrtles and is the perfect setting to enjoy a complimentary biscuit with blueberry preserves. Our server was William who was fun and attentive. Definitely one of our favorite spots in Charlotte- check it out if you haven't been!",

First and foremost, as far as the service goes.. 5+ stars! From the second we walked in to when we picked up our car with the valet, service was 100% on point. Our waitress Ali was exceptional!! Based on that alone I would come back.   The food was also very good. A few better than others, but overall a nice job. The biscuits with honey and jam are awesome!! The Mai Tai was also great! Together we tried the Tomato soup and Tacos to start. They unfortunately did not have anymore of the eggrolls I had heard a lot about... but the Tacos were great! Tomato soup wasn't what I expected, and wasn't the biggest fan of. For dinner we had Shoo Me grits and Chicken BLT w/ mac & cheese. Shrimp were nice and big and plentiful! The portion was really big, might go with the standard size next time. Chicken BLT was a solid choice!   I definitely want to return and try brunch!",

We got there at 5 pm on a Friday because my sister has a young child and they tend to eat on the earlier side and because we needed to be out of there relatively quickly. Although the restaurant was almost completely empty, we had to wait almost 15 minutes to get a table (and that was after we finally asked if we could be seated soon because we had to be somewhere).  Lots of credit to our server who was great with my 2 year old nephew and brought his food out ASAP.  To be honest, my nephew's sweet potato pancake that I stole a bite of was probably the best out of everything we ordered. Unfortunately, the vegetarian options for the adults were just weak (I think they just rolled out a new menu?) and we basically had to order a bunch of sides. Not impressed.  There wasn't even a veggie sandwich option.  Mac and cheese came out cold so we had to send it back. The edamame was a bit soggy and just didn't taste that fresh. We ordered the pimiento cheese appetizer but it didn't come out until after we got the main course (it was clear they forgot about it).   I hear they are opening up a branch in Arlington, Virginia soon, so hopefully that branch will get its act together (and actually have some good vegetarian options too).",

We made reservations and since I came to catch up with a friend, we obviously started chatting. Our waiter asked us if we wanted any alcoholic drinks, we declined and his demeanor got odd.   Our waiter was obviously in a hurry to get us in and out as he stopped by our table three times before we even had a chance to look at a menu.   We had just sat down and already had the feeling like we needed to leave. Nobody spends $14 on avocado toast to shove it down their throats and leave.   We also heard about these famous biscuits and jam and we didn't receive any, so of course that was disappointing as well.   As we were eating and catching up, multiple times our waiter would jump from behind us and say \"HOWS IT GOING!\" like he was trying to be funny and scare us. It was bizarre behavior, happened multiple times, and made me extremely uncomfortable.   What really takes the cake, though, is at the end he told us to give him a five star review on Yelp so he could win a free meal. I think it's pretty ironic that he ruined our brunch and had the nerve to ask for a five star review. Travesty.",

    "text": "I couldn't find a good vegetarian and gluten free friendly place in Charlotte until a friend mentioned yelp and I found the Tupelo Honey Cafe. I ordered the shrimp and grits made with goats milk and the goats milk was kinda sour. It had red peppers on it and I think it over powered the beauty of the grits. I recommend the fried chicken and biscuits, there amazing. It has an egg on top and gravy. It was well seasoned and flavorful. I also recommend the grilled cheese it has homemade tomato sauce. They make there own line of honeys, sauces, and jellies. They are also homemade and delicious! They gave us some biscuits on the house to eat while we wait and they were very salty on their own but with the sweet blueberry jelly it's a perfect biscuit.",

    "text": "Went here for brunch the other weekend. I had the Lavender Honey Flip and Bloody Mary for drinks. The Lavender Honey Flip is refreshing and not sweet at all. The Bloody Mary is on point and has just the right amount of spice. I ordered the fried chicken meal for my entree and got the shaved brussel sprout salad as my side. Can I just say the biscuits are AMAZING with the blueberry jam that they served?! The fried chicken was great, a good ratio between breading and chicken. The kale and carrot side (that comes standard with entrees) and the brussel sprout side were both refreshing and tasty. One of my friends ordered the hash browns which came out a little too salty. Our server was kind enough to take it off the menu. Great atmosphere and love the food and staff!",

And WOW were they fulfilled! Above and beyond. Some of the staff is still new (they have experienced training staff on board for their opening weeks to smoothen the transition), but what a couple of them may lack in savvy waiter quickness and intuition, they make up for it with passion for the food and a genuine eagerness to please their customers. Truly a great experience every time I go - THC opened in early December and I've been 4 times!",

    "text": "We have finally found a honey of a restaurant in the Tupelo Honey Cafe on South Boulevard in Charlotte. You couldn't find a better general manager in Cedric Castro if you searched for years. He attends to every detail. And the highlight of our evening is when we request, no matter how long we have to wait, Iris our server. She is the epitome of professionalism, personality, and care. You have to love her. Once you meet her you'll see. And oh the menu... to die for. I had the buttermilk fried chicken with white gravy, moist and tender, and the smashed cauliflower. The homemade biscuits, jam and Tupelo Honey - it melts in your mouth. My son had the delicious hamburger, mac and cheese and fried okra. We also had the lamb meatballs with the special sauce as our appetizer and for dessert homemade banana pudding. Not just vanilla wafers stuck into instant pudding but the real bona fide thing. We have also met Cedric's assistant Mike, Chef Jason and his team of Turk, James, Kenny and the many more we will continue to meet as we are now happy regulars. Of course there's beer, wine and liquor and the restaurant's architecture is simply beautiful. John Schoeni and John Jr.",

First of all it is really cute inside, I definitely felt like the decor went along with the Southern style they were going for. Our server was incredible.  He walked us through all of the different options we had and gave us great suggestions.  He actually ordered my friend's entire meal! I had the Shoo Cheese grilled cheese sandwich and the flavor was wonderful but I wouldn't have really been able to eat it because the bread was super toasted and hard, but dipping it in my soup, the way I eat it anyway, made it much better,  My friend got the black bean burger and it was AWESOME!!  She also got the creamy onion soup with croutons, which are made from the AMAZING biscuits, and that was delicious too,  'We had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!",

    "text": "I'm always searching for new breakfast spots on the weekend, and went there per a friend's suggestion.  When arriving, I was excited to see complimentary valet - but upon pulling up to the station, the attendant just stared at us.  Didn't move.  After enduring a strange staring contest, and no service, we proceeded to park ourselves.    Upon walking in, I knew immediately this was a 5-star place.  The interior was awesome and I love the little bee paintings and artwork.  We were seated pretty straightaway, and that's when my mental star-rating went down.    - They don't have espresso; it's my belief that if you're going to be a breakfast spot, you should have this all-important a.m. beverage. - We told the server that one of us had an egg allergy.  He takes our order, puts it in, and as the order is being delivered informed us that it had eggs.  Uhm... shouldn't you have told us that when we ordered?  He takes the plate back to the kitchen, then brings it back saying that it didn't have eggs.  Seriously?!  Get it together.   - The wait time for the food was ridiculous.  The place was only half filled, and we had a screaming toddler.  The appetizer biscuits didn't come to our table for 40 minutes, and the actual food (only two plates) arrived in 85 minutes. - The menu options are nice, but really limited.  If you do have an egg allergy, there are no real alternatives.  And if you're not into omelets, fried chicken or shrimp and grits, there are no other viable options - so if you're plain like me, you're SOL.  I left leaving a bit disappointed because I arrived so excited and full of hope.  From the lazy valet, the incompetent server, the long food waiting period, and lack of menu options, I'm sad to say that we will not be returning.",

We searched on google for a good place to get brunch on a Saturday and Tupelo had the best reviews. We stayed at the Westin, it was about a 10 minutes Uber drive. Since it was around 1 pm on a Saturday it was packed. We had to wait about 40 minutes to get a seat, so we took a walk around the block since it was a beautiful day. We finally were seated the tables was a little small, but we're from Pittsburgh and have a breakfast spot here Pamela's with the same setup, so it was okay for us. We took a look at the menu and my fiance and I both decided to order the sweet potatoes pancakes with a fried chicken breast, apple cider vinegar bacon, walnuts, butter, syrup and powder sugar on top. The waiter came out with two biscuits with some jam, the best biscuits I ever had, very moist and buttery. He came out with our plates.  I was in love from the first bite. The sweet potatoes pancake was very sweet and moist, the chicken was fried to perfection, and the bacon was very crispy, it all came together well. We left with a smile on our face, we walked back to the hotel we talked about our meal all the way there. The next time I'm in Charlotte we will make a return.",

    "text": "So disappointed in our last visit here. My BF and I arrived and were seated at a great table this past Sunday morning about 9:00 am. He ordered the Mexican type omelet with chorizo and I ordered my standard sweet potato pancake with fried chicken. We were not impressed with the new menu at all, as an aside. When our food came out, my BF's omelet was barely warm on the outside and the inside was chilled salsa and chorizo. He told our server who took it away. They were going to just serve him another but we decided to split my entree instead. The petite blonde manager came over and apologized and we got lots of apologies but I was surprised and disappointed that the bill wasn't entirely comped due to a very poor and ruined dining experience. This is probably our 8th time dining here and we had a birthday celebration of 6 guests once. We will not return. The service is spotty, the food is inconsistent and management seems unconcerned with serious lapses without any effort to turn a bad experience into a positive one.  Mistakes and errors happen EVERYWHERE...these are OPPORTUNITIES to turn something bad into a positive experience. Tupelo Honey really needs some more training of managers on how to do this. When customers don't return and tell others of bad experiences, it is not a good thing for a business.",

My wife observed that the one in Asheville gave each table a basket of their biscuits, but this one gave each of us one measly biscuit and didn't offered us more. That was kind of disappointing. My wife also indicated that the one in Asheville served the food with a signature flower, but none was offered at this location. The food was very good all in all. But, the coffee was absolutely horrible! When I told the waitress that it was incredibly strong (I mean unbelievably so!) and bitter, she explained that it was a Peruvian blend and even she, who liked strong coffee, couldn't handle what they served. This is ridiculous. This restaurant needs to offer a more subtle blend. I doubt most people would like their coffee. Bottom line is that we'll be back there for breakfast, but TH's CLT does have some shortcomings.",

The goat cheese grits were missing the tangy bite I pictured when I saw goat cheese. Besides that, the grits weren't thick and creamy enough for me.  We shared the crispy grit cakes which had a fantastic texture and was very tasty without being overly greasy. The salsa on the side was a week thought out accompaniment.  My coffee was very good, with a lower acidity than most places (so you don't get that nasty after taste).  While I'm used to waiting long lines for brunch, this place was really pretty packed to the gills. However, service was lovely ask around.",

The bar is seat yourself and we were able to grab a table there while waiting.  Our server greeted us letting us know she wanted to go home. All through our meal she wasn't tentative to little things like drinks -our coffee wasn't hot.  The food was amazing, although it wasn't hot-hot when it was served. The parings of ingredients are great no matter what items you order. There are great spin off southern dishes that everyone should try.  Over all the food will bring us back.",

We had a large party but we had a reservation so there was no wait for us. We were seated immediately. Our waitress was Kayla. She was excellent. She was knowledgeable about the menu and when we asked she gave recommendations. The complimentary biscuits and homemade sauce were delicious. I ordered the fried okra, the shrimp and grits and a mega mimosa. The shrimp and grits were so full of flavor that no additional salt, pepper or butter was needed. The fried okra was seasoned very well.  The mimosa could have used a little more orange juice to sweeten it but it was enjoyable. The manager came out and greeted us because we were celebrating 2 friends and she was very friendly with a bubbly welcoming personality. Without us even asking the checks were separated and we cashed out quick and easy. I even bought some honey to take home. I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Well I finally made it to Tupelo Honey Cafe today.....and it was a great experience! Our server....Jonathan....was so awesome that I told him I was gonna kiss him in the mouth and that he was my new BFF! Obviously I did NOT kiss him but I thoroughly enjoyed the level of customer service. He was knowledgable about all the food which was helpful to first timers like my friend and I. He answered all questions with a smile and even laughed when I said I was going to kiss him. He made it an enjoyable experience.   Now. To the food. We started with the biscuit and their blueberry jam. It was delicious. It was just the right amount of tart and the scratch made biscuit was heavenly. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with BLT and I added avocado. They offered djionnaise but I'm not a fan of Dijon so I went with straight mayo. I wanted the fries but they're seasoned, which I dislike, so I ordered the Mac n cheese on the side. I thought it was good but I wasn't blown away by it. With all the layers of flavor that it supposedly had,  the jalapeno was the most pronounced. The chicken was crispy and the avocado added just the right amount of fat. The tomato added some nice freshness and the bacon added a bit of hickory taste. My friend ordered the sweet potato pancake with the fried chicken and said she enjoyed it but that the sweet potato flavor became real strong after awhile.    Overall a wonderful experience and we will be back soon.",

There is a bar if that's your thing. Lastly, the wait staff is great. We have been to TH several times, but most recently, our waiter was Jonathan. It was particularly busy this day, but Jonathan didn't rush to get our orders as quickly as possible. He actually went out of his way to offer recommendations to those of us who were undecided on what to order. The recommendations were excellent, by the way. Overall, Tupelo Honey is great!

I believe it was around 26 dollars for just that plate but it makes sense why it's expensive since they use shrimps the size of baseballs!!! (Exaggeration but they're jumbo shrimps) lol. I haven't been here for dinner but brunch here is pretty good. But they recently change the way they make their biscuits and I'm not a fan. Bring back the old biscuit recipe!! !",

    "text": "Disappointing given the hype and 30 minute wait at 10am.  Free biscuits and jam - 4/5. The highlight of the meal. Biscuits have fluf, rich complex flavor. Totally interesting enough to eat on their own. Jam is solid and changes the flavor profile.   Fried green tomatoes - 3/5. Goat cheese grits and Roasted red pepper coulis are quite good as a combo. The tomatoes themselves have a pickled flavor but otherwise not much. I normally love fried green tomatoes so was sad to not finish my portion.  Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes - 3/5. A lot of great things that don't really work as well together. The chicken has incredibly crispy bites but otherwise can get boring. Pancakes with maple syrup, butter and pecans are solid but unremarkable. Grilled apple with pickled Blueberries is a fun twist but both were more subtle than I'd like. The eggs are just there with salt and don't really make sense, maybe if there was something on top of the eggs like a sauce? Bacon was not crispy. On the whole, left much or the chicken and pancakes behind.",

We got there early, so we had a small wait, but it wasn't over 20 minutes. Once seated, we started with some mimosas and also put in apps for the fried green tomatoes and avocado toast. For my entree, I ordered (I forget what it's called so I will describe it lol)- but it was steak, egg whites, mixed greens, and their crispy potatoes all drizzled with their honey hot sauce. It honestly was perfection. All entrees come with a side of biscuits- their speciality I'm guessing- and they were amazing!! The biscuits were warm and flaky and doughy! They came with honey and berry preserves, which were amazing!! Honestly, everything at Tupelo Honey is so good and I am still dreaming about those biscuits. I will definitely be back there the next time I'm in Charlotte! I would also like to note that the overall atmosphere of this place is so cute! It's very quaint and homey.",

    "text": "This was our 2nd visit to Tupelo and I was for the most part pleased again but the hubs not so much.    We made reservations online and was seated right away once we arrived on the outside porch.  And while I know the restaurant has no control over this the party behind us had a unsavory fondness for every cuss word and (some I didn't even know) in the world.  It made us weary.  Why cuss why?  Use your words people.   Back to my review - we started with the fried green tomatoes and enjoyed them thoroughly.  The hubster had an IPA (not sure which) and I had a OK pour -I've had more generous pours elsewhere - of a great red blend called Federalist.    Hubster ordered the Sweet Tea Roasted Chicken and found it tooooooo sweet and the brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes for his sides.   The potatoes were silky and flavorful - the brussel sprouts void of any flavor and mushy!  :(  I ordered the Shoo Mercy Pancakes with all sorts of accessories LOL - pancakes were fluffy sort of dense but good; my over medium eggs were cooked perfectly; the fried chicken breast was moist and well seasoned but the bacon was in bits and pieces and cooked so hard I could barely chew it.  I had a grilled pear with pickled blueberries (not sure about that since they tasted just like a regular blueberry) but still good.    Our waiter was a little spread thin it seemed and went missing often throughout the evening.  :(   When our appetizer was delivered the waitress (not our waiter) said we are out of knives they are in the dishwasher.  OK - we get our food a while later and ask for knives and explained what the waitress said about them and our waiter says \"HUH, Really that seems like a big Lie but oh well - I'll get you some!\"  Restaurant owners listen up - IT IS NOT GOOD TO WITNESS YOUR STAFF TALKING NEGATIVELY ABOUT THE OTHER!  Overall the jury is still out for Tupelo - I like it but not at the same time.  It's ok to have trendy farm to table themes and whatnot but at the end of the day the food should be good period for everybody!",

Our appetizer was the macaroni and cheese bites with gravy, creole style.  When the server set the app in front of us we were underwhelmed. Three small fried macaroni balls with a small side of gravy. I was excited for a spicy explosion in my mouth thinking, quality not quantity. Nothing. Each Mac ball = $3. I could have cooked up a Kraft box of Mac and cheese and fried them into three balls for 1/8 the price and sprinkled some spice on them. Our entrees came out next. My husband's looked so so. My dish included an overwhelming amount of BURNED brussel sprouts and the house made black bean burger. I ate a couple of bites of the brussel sprouts but couldn't  stomach any more because they were so burned. And it was difficult to find any black beans in my house made black bean burger. It was sub par for the price. We each had two alcoholic beverages: a wheat beer, rose drink, mimosa, and white wine. All were ok, but overpriced. We won't be back. Such high hopes after reading through the menu before we visited. Maybe it was just an off day in the kitchen. On the plus side, service at the bar was great.",

    "text": "I was at Tupelo Honey this past weekend for a (large) surprise birthday party. It's not the ideal setting for a party, as the tables are fairly close together. It made mingling mildly difficult. The atmosphere is beautiful though, and the service staff was exceptional.  The food definitely left a bit to be desired. The fact that my boyfriend ordered fish & chips (for $19, mind you) and received what looked like a kid's order of chicken fingers. It was a pathetically small pile of average-looking fries and a few TINY strips of fried fish. I almost laughed when it was brought to the table. For a restaurant that prides itself on presentation, the fish & chips are a complete joke.   I had better luck with the sweet tea brined chicken meal. The chicken was far from being the best I'd ever had - it was pretty dry, but the sweet tea flavor definitely came through and it was very tasty overall. The star of the meal was the brussel sprouts - absolutely incredible. They were charred and crispy and perfectly seasoned, and our whole table was eyeing them on my plate. I also had the mashed potatoes, which were good but nothing special.  A few of our party's guests got the shrimp and grits and said that it was excellent. Their beer and wine selection, as well as their cocktails, all received rave reviews.   I still want to visit Tupelo for brunch, but I won't return for dinner. Drinks and side dishes are the stars here. 5 stars for the excellent service - the staff were friendly, patient, and even provided us an extra table for the birthday boy's gifts. As with all large groups, there were a few members of our party that were difficult, and the staff handled it very gracefully.",

Even though we came on a Monday Brunch/Lunch, we made a reservation for 12:15 pm for the outside patio and THANK GOD we did, because there were so many people here at that time. Whether corporate lunches or personal, there were just so many people that wanted to sit outside.  We ordered with our stomachs and not our eyes and realized we were so so stuffed by the end of our appetizers. For appetizers: we ordered Crispy Brussels (without Bacon) and Fried Okra. Both were mouthwatering delicious. I also ordered a Rosemary Peach Lemonade which was tasty! 100% recommend!  For our entree, I did the Lunch Combo - 1/2 spicy avocado & egg sandwich, 1/2 mixed greens salad, and french fries. The spicy avocado & egg sandwich comes with a organic nut bread, but I'm allergic so I requested a different bread. They ran out of sourdough so I opted for Pumpernickel. Everything was super delicious, but I was so full from apps I ate everything inside my sandwich and left the bread. I couldn't even finish my fries (!!!).   All in all, a beautiful & delicious lunch spot!",

Good shade though from the sun on their deck.   Our server came over pretty quickly. I can't remember her name, but she was super friendly and funny. We ordered a bunch of small bites, fried green tomatoes, cauliflower bites, fried okra, Brussel sprouts, avocado toast and Mac and cheese. Our server brought us our jam and biscuits. Their blueberry jam is delicious. Everything came out pretty fast and everything was delicious. My favorite was the avocado toast & fried okra.   My coworker bought a jar of the blueberry jam, and the server gave me a jar of honey for free. Overall, service and food was good. Definitely a good lunch spot!",

When you think of Southern hospitality, your mind should go straight to Tupelo Honey.  When you think of the 'ol fashioned term \"The Hostess with the Mostest,\" my mind went straight to my TH visit. Upon arriving, I was graced with the presence of the glowing hostess, Sydina. Ahh, there's that name. Sydina, yes, Sydina. Such an unforgettable name on such an unforgettable visit. Handling her duties with such poise and such grace throughout all the noise she constantly looked me in the face. Sydina should be recognized for her pure podium professionalism.  Another great thing about TH, besides Sydina, is that the company responsibly sources their food from exceptional farmers. It's almost like they infuse Southern spirit into every bite. Nothing says gracious and delicious Southern food like Tupelo Honey, honey. Bless y'alls heart.",

A year ago the heat wasn't working and everyone was walking around in winter clothing. But the amazing shakshuka and goat cheese grits lured us back.  This time the ticketing system was down, kitchen orders were crazy backed up, orders came out in unusual patterns (one person got their breakfast 15 minutes before everyone else) and one breakfast was cold to the touch (and not made to order).  We didn't ask for a manager, but the server said they would bring a manager over anyway, likely just to smooth things over.  But a manager never came.  4 of the 5 breakfasts were delicious.  They also didn't charge us for our drinks and single cold breakfast, which was kind. But it's just not a consistent experience here.",

It was like bagged super market greens with one slice of watermelon radish. And the only dressing that comes with it was bad. I asked the waitress if the fish and chips were any good. She lied to me because they were pretty bad. (Side note, the fish and chips at Red Robin is pretty good.) The manager seemed put off and showed little to no concern about our complaints. But did not charge us for two of the four entrees. Very big of him.",

We looked up Tupelo Honey before we left and decided we'd try dinner there. Heads up! Make a reservation. We made a reservation ahead of time using OpenTable and there was only a 5-6 minute wait versus a couple who walked in after and was told 40-45 minutes. Now that that's out of the way, get started. They start you off with housemade biscuits accompanied by honey and blueberry jam. They were really good. Crunchy tops but the inside was soft and fluffy. For an appetizer we got the crispy brussel sprouts. Very delicious and seasoned well. Lived up to the name, crispy. Definitely crisp, not burnt. We were going to try their dip with the collard greens but the manager informed us that the entire batch of it was ruined and there was none available for the day. Smh  The egg rolls were good but normally if the filling is savory, I prefer a sweet sauce. There's was a mustardy looking Sauce but wasn't sweet. Dipped it in honey instead, way better!  I ordered the fried chicken with two sides. It was cool. Smaller cuts of chicken but seasoned well. The Mac and cheese was pretty decent and the collards could use some more salt. Other than that this place is very lively and the atmosphere is great. Had the rosemary peach lemonade. You can definitely taste the rosemary and combined with the peach was a very different but tasty flavor combination. Will definitely be back next time we're in town.",

Our hostess seats us in a quaint corner and we wait, and wait, and wait.  While watching other tables get served before us, odd but True.  I go back to the hostess and inform that we are still waiting for our server, but other people sat after us were being served.   She was shocked. Truth is, by the time she came to our table we were packing up to leave.  Then she says, I've ordered your table an appetizer, I am so sorry, your server will be here soon.  Ok, it's like 9 pm and we would have to go somewhere else so we stayed.  Then, one of the managers come over with like 4 appetizers, water, apologies, and our server shows up, apologized.  We get it, it's late and he's overwhelmed with tables.    We order, he brings our biscuits; which by the way is the reason I came because the blueberry compote and honey is AMAZING!!  The other manager comes over, apologizes and wants to make sure we are ok.  More importantly, our dinner date has made a turn and we are now enjoying ourselves and not having to drag our 4 year old somewhere else to eat.    Honestly, when the food came we couldn't even eat it because we were stuffed on ALL the appetizers they brought to us.  So, most of our food we took home!! Anyway, we had a better time than what I thought because we were headed out the door.   Ok, to boot, I took my last biscuit and wanted the compote, but I left it on the table.  As we were leaving out our hostess comes through the door and stopped us to give us a jar of compote!!! In my head I'm like YES!  Won't he do it!!! Listen, my 4 stars are for the wait, but they made it up to us with the end result of our service. I can tell they pride hem selves on customer service.  Love that!",

We all ordered drinks to start. Honeysuckle lavender flip, pretty drink with a cute name that basically tasted like vodka lemonade. Not a bad thing just nothing special. Sangria was tasty but had so much pulp and fruit pieces, it was too much. Margarita, I wouldn't suggest.  As for food, we started with the fried green tomatoes. This is not my favorite appetizer regardless of the restaurant but, TH does them pretty well. Thick tomato slices with a good crunch served with grits. For entrees we had shrimp and grits, fried chicken, sweet potato pancakes, salmon, and sides of mac n cheese and Brussels. Everything came with very large portions and everything was good but nothing was great. Out of all the dishes I think the shrimp and grits had the best flavors going. We also ordered the s'mores cake for dessert. Don't bother, dessert was a let down.   Service was very friendly all around but also very slow. I'd go back, just wouldn't be my first choice.",

    "text": "One of the best southern comfort food restaurant I've been to!  First time in Charlotte and my friend recommends this place after hearing great reviews, so we decide to give it a try.  To start off, they give you some free biscuits to munch on.  (Tip: ask for honey to dip it in, it will change your experience eating them!).  We got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (Tip: get a side of the crispy Brussels sprouts and dip it with their homemade ranch dressing--it's amazing), Shrimp and Grits and the baked Mac n Cheese.  Everything was delicious!  Service was good--came here during lunch on a Friday, it wasn't too packed so we got a table right away.  (There is a small patio for tables outside for those who like outdoor seating.)  Not sure when I'll have a chance to come back and visit Charlotte, but I would definitely come back here for their food!",

    "text": "Saturday morning brunch in Charlotte. This place is a nice southern style farm to table type restaurant. Their brunch reminds me of this place called noble crust in St. Petersburg, FL.   We were seated immediately. It is spacious with an open kitchen , so you can see the food cooking. I got the pre fix menu and they offered two choices between appetizers and an entree. I went with the pear salad and the crab Benedict with bottomless coffee.  They started us out with biscuits with homemade blueberry jam. The jam looked extremely fresh with the berries still intact. The pear salad was pretty but kind of hard to eat with the big Bibb lettuce. It was a nice light start to get some good greens in. If your trying to keep a more trim meal I would go with this vs the avocado toast.   The crab Benedict was ok. The best part was the biscuit but it was kind of lukewarm. It wasn't something that I would rave about. I swapped out the potato cracklin with the Brussel Sprouts. I loved those. Very crispy and flavorful. It was only an extra dollar to do so. The other items on the menu looked amazing and it was kind of hard to pick what I wanted. This is somewhere I would definitely come back to when I am in Charlotte again.",

Unfortunately I was very underwhelmed from the service to the food in general. The flatbread sandwich I ordered was so greasy it was hard to stomach. The collard greens, which are a staple in the south, were nothing more than bitter boiled greens with no flavor. The best thing about this place were the complimentary biscuits. The service was incredibly slow, in fact we almost missed our flight because of it. This is not a place I will return to. Maybe it was a bad day for service or I ordered the wrong items but the rest of my party stated their food was very lackluster as well.",

What made me give the restaurant a 3 is because their recipes have to be followed verbatim and they don't do a lot of substituting or change to how you want something cooked.  One of the people I was with ordered from the small plate wanting the little breakfast sandwich but had sunny side eggs and wanted it cooked well done, but was told that could not happened.  I ordered the steak and eggs which was delish and the other person ordered the sweet potato pancakes. The food for breakfast was kind of pricey. If your gonna pay the amount I think things should be made how u want them.",

The better half's buttermilk fried chicken meal was warm enough. Her sides were barely warm.   Just poor kitchen management.   This might explain the mixed reviews.   Easy enough to fix. Most places have mastered the concept, I'm sure the owners can find someone to get the place back on a consistent track.",

I ended up going with the $23 prixe fixe brunch menu which you get your choice of unlimited coffee or tea, small plate, and a larger plate. I ended up going for the fried green tomatoes and the Sockeye Salmon. I hastily made my decision because I didn't want to be THAT person the server waits on. I looked back at the menu and looked at what I had ordered and both plates had goat cheese incorporated into the grits. EW I hate goat cheese. Oh when I received my plates I took a bite of the grits and oh wow I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.   Also everyone needs to get over the menu change.

The atmosphere is trendy, yet family-friendly, and the drink menu and beer selection as good as you'll find anywhere.  Oh, and the BISCUITS! Simply unbelievable.

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the South End neighborhood of Charlotte to Tupelo Honey Cafe which is located on the second floor in a renovated historic building near Charlotte's light rail. The interior is a mix of industrial and rustic with lots of wood, exposed brick walls, and high ceilings.  Dora here. Don't you just love the interior? This is my kinda place. Parking around noon on Saturday was non-existent in the lot behind the restaurant, but no worries. There's free on-street parking on the other side of the light rail. Also, the 35-minute wait only ended up being 15 minutes. Another score!  Rather than table bread, Tupelo serves scratch-made biscuits with blueberry jam. These biscuits were great, crispy and buttery and warm, and the blueberry jam was the perfect pairing. We would have preferred to eat ours prior to the meal, but with a packed dining room, they came out with our meal. Dora here. I don't care what time they got to the table. I could've stuffed myself with these biscuits! The food did seem to take awhile, but service was very attentive and gracious.  I chose the Tupelo Farm Fresh Burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, house-made pickles and a secret sauce along with fried okra and tomatoes. The burger was outstanding, grilled perfectly, tasty, and the secret sauce brought it all together. The okra and tomatoes were fresh, lightly battered with just the right amount of crunch.   Dora here. So many choices! But I finally decided on the Charleston Chicken Sandwich, a marinated grilled chicken breast with lettuce, Havarti cheese on sourdough wheat bread with a side of mac-n-cheese. Doesn't that sound great? The chicken was oh-so-tender and juicy, and I really liked the cranberry flavored mayo. First time eating sourdough wheat bread, and I liked it. The mac-n-cheese was creamy with just the right amount of firmness and kick.   I would rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. Definitely worth a return visit! Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

We were so in love with the menu choices, the background music and the no-wait time that we couldn't decide on what to eat. Our waitress gave great selections. We ended up starting with the \"Avocado Crostini\". The bread wasn't the best, the red chili infused honey on top was the real winner of the small plate.   For my actual meal I had the Southern Fried Chicken BLT. It comes with a fried chicken breast (mine ended up being shaped like a heart and I'm still not over how precious it was), a slice of tomato, a lettuce leaf and a dijonnaise sauce. Needless to say it was perfect in every single way possible. As my side I chose the MAC AND CHEESE AND THIS IS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.   Service can move a little slow, and you should remember that you cannot order an alcoholic beverage until noon, but as soon as someone starts ringing a bell yelling about Bloody Marys, order a round of Cast Iron Mac&Cheese and grab some brunch-time dranks. It'll be the best.",

Our server Kevin was lovely and explained every question we had. The carolina dip was really yummy! Wish we would have known that you get biscuits while you wait because we ended up not being able to finish the main course. The only bad thing was that they were out of pretty much every pork product there.

    "text": "I was recently in Charlotte for the CIAA weekend, and on Sunday before my flight back to DC, we were searching for a yummy brunch spot to top off the trip. We stumbled upon Tupelo, and despite being told that there was about a 45 minute wait, the kind hostess suggested that we try to find a place in the bar area, which was first come, first served. Thanks to her, we ordered a mimosa (super good and strong) from the bar and hovered around searching for the tell-tale signs of a group getting up.  We spotted a table becoming empty and we bum-rushed it, and a friendly server Cesar came and got our table clean right away. He was SO friendly, personable, and knowledgeable about the menu. My friend was vegan, so he also made great suggestions for that as well. Our mimosas were SOO good that we had to get another, and I ordered the Macaroni & Cheese with the Cajun Blackened Shrimp. I felt so greedy gobbling it down but it was so stinkin' good! Cesar checked on us frequently despite having a plethora of tables and other customers to attend to.  The prices are very reasonable, and again, the mimosas were so good! We even stopped by the hostess stand afterwards to speak to the manager, who was also super warm and friendly. I found out that they are opening more locations in the US, so I now have a favorite spot to go to when I come back to Charlotte! Definitely a place where I would return, please keep up the good work.",

Been here several times after my initial review and the food wasn't as good and the service was absolutely awful.  The wait for the food was at least an hour and our server would disappear constantly.  When we finally got our food, the food was cold and was either overlooked or undercooked.  It was a mess.  It's a terrible experience if it's busy.  Decent experience after the lunch rush or the brunch rush.  I would not recommend going on the weekend unless you go early.  On the upside, the manager discounted our bill since we had such bad service and our food was cold.  She really tried to make things right, but it was too late.  We were hungry and ate the food cold.",

They had a 35 minute wait so a reservation would have been a good idea, but then we got lucky and got a table in the bar area which is apparently first come, first served. The menu is huge and overwhelming. I wanted to try the Queen Mary which is a Bloody Mary with a LOT of things in it, but according to state law, you can't drink alcohol before noon on Sundays and I didn't want to wait.  I ordered the shoo mercy omelet, my husband ordered the Tupelo Farm Fresh burger, and our friends ordered the shoo mercy cheesy grill sandwich and the sweet potato pancakes. I'll make this easy -- everything was amazingly delicious! (Yes I tried everyone's food) Basically anything shoo mercy is delicious. It's all the same stuff in different forms: sandwich, omelet, shrimp n' grits etc. Also, serving sizes are huge so come with an appetite. I couldn't finish more than a quarter of my omelet so needless to say, I had it for another meal.",

    "text": "How the mighty have fallen! (Ok, the \"mighty\" part may be a slight exaggeration)  My friend and I were looking for a brunch spot that is semi-causal this recent Sunday. We arrived after 1pm, and were faced with a big crowd of people on the balcony already in wait for tables. We were told the wait for a 2-top would be 35 minutes but that all the spaces in the bar area were up for grab. Bar area it was.  There were lots of empty spots at the bar - all with dirty dishes & glasses piled up in front of. Be warned: \"pre-bus\" is not a practice or a concept here. We sat at one of the long tables (communal style), and no one greeted us with anything. I ended up getting our own menus, and my friend ended up cleaning up the rest of the table himself (Side note: you would think if a patron ask for a towel to wipe up a dirty table, that someone would come and do it - nope, they just handed him a towel).   It took forever for drinks to arrive - the bloody mary ($8 for a very small glass) was bloody watery by the time it got to our table. Good thing it was not for me. We enjoyed the biscuits alot, because we were starving at this point. I ordered the Fried Egg BLT ($9) and opt for a cup of soup ($1 add on). My friend ordered a burger. My dish arrived as a Fried CHICKEN BLT - so I had to wait again for my food. My friend's 2nd bloody mary never made it to the table. At the end the food was OK but I was too busy being baffled by the chaotic/slow/bad service to enjoy much of it.  In short - it was a nightmare of an experience in terms of service. The food was ok, but not enough for anyone to put up with that amount of incompetence. A word of advice to Management: Do something or you are not going to have much repeat business. One can only ride on the name and notoriety for so long.",

I am and was duly impressed beyond anything about this place.  I even found out that it is a chain!  Oh my word.  I couldn't believe it when my sister told me.  My husband and I raved and raved about this place to them and they'd already been to one in upstate North Carolina.  The walk up was gorgeous.  They are on the second floor of an old industrial building in a trendy neighborhood that is up and coming.  We took the elevator up because my ankle was still healing y'all.  And what an opening!  The awning was awesome and the outdoor area was filled with awesome decor.  The tables were real wood and the cushions in the chairs were soft.  The colors were springtime and I wanted to sit outside but flies in the South are major.  The hostess greeted us warmly and I had to tell her about the place.  I was impressed.  She told me they were coming to California as well.  So we sat and had t he prettiest waitress.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu and told me her fave drink.  Score!  Drinks with breakfast is a prerequesite and I was a taker.  I had the Hurricane and the spouse had the other fruity drink.  Both were amazingly good.  Spouse said his was too sweet so I downed that one too.  He did order another drink and was good with that one.  Now the food.  I had the shrimp and grits.  Now I am not one to order this meal from any menu.  As y'all know, I am from New Orleans and a food tasting snob.  Shrimp and grits are not right if not from the Bayou!  But I stand to be corrected.  The meal included andouille and the gravy was savory.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and they were colossal!  So yummy, yummy in my tummy.  The coffee that the served with the food was awesome as well.  The portion size was Souther huge, of course.  I could not eat it all.  The spouse had the eggs and bacon and sausage.  He loved it.  His home fries were also good as well.  The biscuits looked great too.  Breakfast is wonderful at Tupelo Honey and worth the money!  Go get yours honey!",

My mom, sister, and I decided to give this location a try for lunch, and it was a let down. We walked up the steep steps to slowly and leisurely be greeted by the hostess. We were seated in a nice booth, and the ambiance of the cafe is really nice. Cool designs, light fixtures, and just a really creative, unique layout. That was the best part of our experience here..ha. Our waitress brought us our menus and then pretty much forgot about us for 15 minutes. Once we finally ordered we waiting another 25-30 minutes to get our food. YIKES. It was weird, I actually laughed when I saw our food coming. One of the chefs (I'm guessing) brought our food out and my salad was pressed up against his shirt while he was struggling to carry the other two plates. As for the food...ehh. My personal opinion is that their beautifully put together menu is much better than the actual execution. I got the signature salad, it was okay, it had ALOT of dressing. My mom got the county fried avacado, the breading was very overpowering. We also got a side of baked mac and cheese which tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave from last night then sat out for a couple minutes. My sister got the southern belle grilled cheese and boy was that weird looking. The bread was a bit soggy and the cheese wasn't really melted, but the flavor was there. Overall our server was terrible and the food was pretty mediocre..I did enjoy my water though!",

But hey it was Labor Day and yes the food is good so I didn't mind. The good thing was they said 45-1 hr but it was only about 30. I love the fried green tomatoes and grits so that was my starter and it never disappoints. For my meal, I had the smoked jalapeno fried egg BLT. I opted for the jalapeno aioli on the side because I don't like things spicy. It was good and not too much kick. The sandwich was good and the potatoes on the side were seasoned great. My only complaint was my bread was too greasy. Not greasy enough that I wouldn't make another visit. I'd definitely give them another try. Next time, I'd see if it's consistently greasy or just request it without the buttered bread. Awesome place!!!  P.S. The $3 mimosas were great too!!!",

I couldn't tell if she was angry or just socially awkward. I ordered the biscuit with fried chicken and egg... She told me it was really spicy and suggested the cheese grits to help mellow it out to which I agreed. The biscuits are the best thing here. The fried chicken was soggy and dry and hardly spicy. And the grits are goat cheese which almost made me gag since it was unexpected. I paid $17 for a breakfast I ate half of as I was ogled. I don't get the hype.",

    "text": "I recently went to the Tupelo location in Charlotte. After visiting the one in Raleigh I thought it was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday. The majority of my experience was wonderful the food was great. My main issue came with the service. My best friend arrived before me and asked \"what do yall do for birthdays?\" and she got the response that they sing happy birthday and the typical restaurant thing. My reservation stated that it was my birthday and also my friends had a balloon at the table that says \"happy birthday\" on it. So towards the end of the service we realized another table was also celebrating a birthday and we watched as everyone sang happy birthday and ice cream was brought out with a candle in it. It was extremely awkward waiting for my turn which never came. When my best friend ask the server why I didn't receive one she said in a rude tone \"well maybe they paid for it?\" When I've always know it to be customary. I was extremely embarrassed. I hate to blame everything on race but its so heart breaking watching a table full of white people being recognized for a birthday and it seeming as though me being a person of color my birthday was irrelevant. I came to celebrate another year of my life and i left with my heart in my stomach basically. When i left carrying a \"happy birthday\" balloon and random people were telling me happy birthday but i was just made to feel like it did not even matter. When i tell you I absolutely love this restaurant and to have been treated like this on my birthday it was extremely hurtful, embarrassing, and I feel as though i'm not even welcomed there. I filed a complaint after the evening just did not sit right with me. The response that I received from the general manager David Gordon was \" We do not sing, have never sung here and we do not have candles.  Not sure where this women ate???\" After which I replied I felt further disrespected. The final email I received stated that \"  I did not realize you were linked into our messages.\"  Never again will I spend my money at an establishment such as this that does not respect me as a person.",

The wait staff was fantastic. They had a nice beer selection. And the food was DELICIOUS! The biscuits they brought to the table were exactly what I needed. And the veggie burger was my favorite style of veggie burger patty, thick, firm enough to stay together but not tough.  We'd gone here because my wife HAD TO HAVE some fried okra. And she got it! She loved it, it came out piping hot and the dipping sauce was exactly what she was looking for.  And the price was very reasonable considering the high-quality menu and the well-cared for building.   I highly recommend this place!",

We had the rosemary peach lemonade - I couldn't have enough of that - had a couple glasses - I need that recipe! Overall very pleasant experience.

    "text": "I've been dying to try this place so I stopped in. The menu is plentiful with appetizers, small plates, and of course full meals. There's something for everyone. We sat near the kitchen and dang near everything that was set on that counter looked delicious.   But let's talk service first. Our server's name was Brittany and she was amazing! She greeted us shortly after we sat down, our drinks were never empty and she came back several times to make sure everything was ok. I'd like to add that she did all this and provided excellent service on a packed Saturday night while people were on town for Pride. I say that because sometimes in places service tends to suffer when servers are overwhelmed with tables and all. Brittany handled it like a champ and never dropped the ball or let us see her sweat lol. Of course her most difficult task was asking if we wanted dessert even bough I'm sure my tummy looked like it was ready to explode lol. I was tempted. It next time I will for sure try something because I saw a few leave the kitchen and they looked divine. Anyways I'd certainly go back and ask for Brittany. She takes care of the customers.  They give you a biscuit before your meal with a side of some blueberry jam. The biscuit is really soft, warm and flaky. I don't even like biscuits but I would go and order just those if I could. I ordered the Salted Roasted Beets w/ Pecan crusted goat cheese. It was good but for $9 I expected a few more beets on the plate. For my main meal, I ordered the Wampus Cat Ribs w/ Apple Cider Greens & Baked Mac and sampled some of the meatloaf off my sweety's plate. The meatloaf was okay. Not really my style with the tomato salsa on top (I prefer a gravy or glaze) but it wasn't bad. My ribs though... were DELICIOUS! They had a kick of spiciness to them, very meaty and tender the way a rib should be. The greens were good and there was a good serving on the plate. My mac & cheese was also really good. Probably one of the few restaurants I've been to in the Carolinas that makes a proper mac and actually BAKES it, not that stovetop crap. Normally I don't like the bread crumbs on top but this was really good and cheesy and so I didn't mind so much.   Overall, I would definitely go back to sample some more of their goodies (porkchops, scallops, peach ribs, pulled pork) and more sides too (they need a veggie plate lol). Food: A.   Service: A+",

When we first walked in, we were greeted with smiles. The first time, we came on a Thursday night. Second time, on a Friday night. Both times a little after 6pm and we were seated right away. We had the same waiter both times (unfortunately I forgot his name..) He was fantastic. He patiently answered our questions regarding the drinks and food and throughout the night, he checked on us frequently to make sure everything was going okay.   FOOD: 5 stars. So far we've had the Sassafras Porterhouse Porkchop, Fried Chicken, Shrimp and Grits, and Wicked Chicken Sandwich (listed in the order of our favorites). The dishes are generous portions (I was struggling to finish my plate). The only thing I would change is to get the gravy on the side when ordering Fried Chicken, or ask for extra gravy on the chicken. I ended up not having enough gravy on my Fried Chicken. But it was still very delicious! Seasoned and fried perfectly.   Biscuits came out warm and fresh. And the jam was delicious. Yum! But don't eat too much in order to save room for the meal!  Also I usually don't like banana pudding, but the waiter surprised us with banana pudding on the house (after hearing it was my birthday) and I loved it!! Totally ate all of it.",

Two was all I needed. The Bar Tenders were fast, friendly and offered a strong pour.  The food was tapas style. My favorites were:  * Bacon Biscuit Slider with Orange Jalapeno Marmalade and Cream Cheese Boom!  * Chorizo, Egg and Pimento Cheese Taco  * Pain Perdu with Blueberry Compote  I added the 'Boom!' up there for effect. Their spicy tacos hit the spot too. Chef was very active, out on the floor. He made a couple of dishes off the menu which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.   Did I mention the people? Lots of fun people there hanging out. We piled in a long tall table in the middle of the room and sat on bar stools. I stood half the time too.  The Moonrise Brunch has three critical elements that make for a great night: tasty food with variety, strong drinks with lightning fast service and a great group of people that want to hang out and have fun!   Highly recommended!",

I am giving a bonus star because they are accommodating towards folks with Celiac Disease and have a good range of gluten-free options for my friends. I've eaten at Tupelo twice for dinner; once in the Knoxville location and once in Charlotte. My meals were unremarkable at both locations.   I've tried the shrimp and grits as well as the buttermilk fried chicken. Both were just okay, and truthfully not worth writing about. I personally found the freebie biscuit to be overly salty and reminiscent of the biscuits served at Red Lobster. I haven't tried any of the cocktails, but with restaurants situated in locations with great beer culture, I would expect for more draft options. The food quality definitely speaks to that of a chain restaurant, which it is.",

I recommend them over everything else on that menu, and I haven't even tried anything else, except the macaroni n cheese, (which was good) and hush puppies (also good; they have a hint of lemon in them). What this is, is sweet potato pancakes, with slices of bacon, a piece of crispy fried chicken, candied pecans, and a pat of butter, all on top. (A cup of syrup comes on the plate too) On the side it comes with eggs cooked your way, & some kind of baked apple. I ordered scrambled eggs with havarti cheese. It was great! As for my drink I ordered rosemary peach lemonade. Try it if you can.  All of their food is sourced locally as possible, so the menu is subject to change as our waiter said.",

Love his passion and knowledge about the menu and the restaurant- he even gave us some suggestion on what to do in Charlotte while visiting. Omelettes should come with home fries or something else other than bread. The portions need to be bigger - come on! It is southern good for God sake !",

The sweet figs with savory goat cheese was fabulous, just the right amount of salty and sweet. Then we tried the crab cake app which was a homemade one in that it had the lump crab bits and a subtle seasoning everyone liked. This was my first time here and the biscuits lived up to the descriptions I've heard. Fluffy and sweet with intoxicating buttery flavors I was so happy to eat there. Dinner entree was the pan fried trout and I liked the simple seasoning and delicate flaky texture of the dish.  The beers we had were liked by all also. My party agreed we would return to TH again. We were a full and happy crew!",

The cauliflower and carrots with butter milk drizzle is awesome! I could've eaten a large bowl and called it dinner. I followed that with a flat iron steak/honey Brussels sprouts and hominy/fingerling potatoes. The horseradish is a VERY prominent flavor in this dish, maybe a little more than I wanted or needed. But everyone has a different palate. I look forward to trying something else next month. I am never disappointed at Tupelo Honey.",

Our waiter was very friendly and the biscuits to start with were delicious.  I wasn't really sure what I wanted for dinner and nothing really jumped out at me at first glance. They have a burger on the menu that had toppings (pork confit, cheese sauce) that just didn't appeal to me so I asked if I could order a regular burger without all of that. I was told that wasn't possible. I understand that chefs want their food eaten a certain way but it was just a little bit odd to me.   I ended up ordering the short rib, which came with roasted carrots, potatoes, and a spring pea cream. It was really delicious. The short rib was good but the veggies were honestly the best part of the meal. Overall it was a fun place to visit but from what I understand it may be a better choice for brunch than dinner.",

This is a life changer, especially with Charlotte passing the new brunch bill serving drannnnksss at 10!  I made a reservation for 11:30 on Sunday.  We were seated at 11:45, which was amazing because there was an hour and a half wait!  There were people everywhere.  Once we were seated everything moved quickly.  Our server came over promptly and took our drink orders.  I went with the mega mimosa, with just a splash of OJ.   Drinks came out quickly and I was surprised at how generous my mimosa pour was.  The server also brought out some of those delicious biscuits with jelly and honey.  These are amazing.    For the order my husband and I split the sho mercy pancake meal.  The portion was huge and was plenty for us to split, so don't let the price tag fool you.   There were four pancakes, fruit, two eggs? Two pieces of bacon, and some amazing butter and syrup. (See my picture). All of the flavors went together perfectly and it was really good!!!! I try to eat healthy most of the time but I didn't mind splurging for this.  To top it off Tupelo had sent me a coupon to sample their mason jar desserts.  O.M.G. These were sooooooo good! My favorite was the peanut butter one with pretzels and chocolate.  We left stuffed and happy.",

The owners did a good job though of making the outdoor seating feel like you were on a balcony in Charleston or even New Orleans. You can either take the stairs to the restaurant or use the generously sized elevator.  Service was fine. I was greeted in a timely manner and given water in the average time. The kitchen though took forever on getting my food out. It took over 40 mins to get my order at which point I had to take my food to go. I ordered the catfish with sides of Brussel sprouts and collard greens. Both of my sides were not to my liking, the collard greens were supposed to have pork but I couldn't taste any and instead the greens were just bitter. The Brussel sprouts were better but I've certainly had better. Come to think of it, the ones I've roasted are even better... The catfish looked like there would be lots of flavor to it but it ended up falling flat in taste. I could see myself going back to try something different in hopes I find something I like. I'd give them the chance because despite the long wait on my food the place had a good vibe and the service was pleasant.",

    "text": "We ended up here mainly because Leroy Fox South End SUCKS!! So we came across Tupelo on Yelp and since it was close by we decided to give a try. We were craving some southern comfort food so it seemed like the right choice. It was interesting seeing Angie Harmon (Law & Order)  at the bar, but on to the review.    We were greeted immediately and seated promptly. Maria our server was excellent. The sweet tea was delicious, the complimentary biscuits were meh! Their menu is very limited and to my surprise they DO NOT serve any mashed potatoes! Unreal, a southern restaurant that doesn't serve mash is blasphemy.    From their limited menu I picked the Blackened Catfish which was very fishy accompanied with baked Mac & Cheese and French fries. The sides were actually pretty good. We also ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and that was very good!   Their portions are fair, but their prices are steep. The sweet tea is delicious and as usual it's free refills.   The main reason for the 2 star review is due to the limited menu with no mashed potato on it, and the absurdly small portion of banana pudding which they charge $6.50 for! The container is so tiny and to make matters worse, they don't even fill the container! GREEDY!!!   It's definitely not an authentic Southern Restaurant and more of a tourist trap. I wouldn't recommend it.",

I was wise enough to make reservations and we had little to no wait time as there were plenty of patrons waiting to get seated.  I started out with a Megamosa (large mimosa) and they brought biscuits, fresh blueberry jam, and honey to the table. I couldn't help but to indulge while my hubby continuously battled back and forth over his brunch selections.  The jam was delicious as well as the honey atop of the biscuit. We both ordered the Shoo-Mercy Sweet Potato and I must say, it was one of THE best breakfast entrees we've had in quite awhile from any restaurant.  The sweet potato pancakes along with the fried chicken breast were soooo delish!!! It was a perfect combination. The baked apple as well as the eggs were nice accompaniments. It comes with bacon as well, but I had mine without the bacon.  I did kinda regret eating that biscuit as the Shoo-Mercy won the battle. My hubby ended up devouring his while I struggled to finish. I ended up boxing the rest to-go and it tasted the same when I ate it later that day. The service and quality of food were great and we'll definitely be back!",

I got their sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken on top- this is a dish for two people! I ate all the chicken and the baked apple was good with the bacon, but I could only eat one of the pancakes. Everything was good, the chicken was juicy and crispy, and the bacon was not too greasy. The baked apple added a nice tartness and lightness to the whole dish. One thing I appreciated- they actually made my eggs over medium!!! This is a rarity and I commend the chef for making my eggs a perfect medium, thank you!!!",

We saw others waiting for a good while and I overheard the hostess tell someone the wait was over an hour.  We ordered a couple of drinks and food for the kids quickly. When the waitress returned we placed the adult order. Oddly, all of the food came out at the same time (after a decent wait). Not the best when feeding young kids.  Overall happy with our experience, will give it another shot when we're nearby.",

Parking and traffic were a bit tricky but we were able to find a spot.  There was no real wait for a 12:00 lunch.  Service was friendly, helpful, and prompt.  Oh my, the biscuits and jam to start off were amazing.  If they kept bringing them I would not have needed lunch!  There were so many great options on the menu it was tough to decide.  My wife opted for the grilled chicken sandwich and I had the wicked chicken sandwich.  It was a lot of food.  The fries were perfect with a great crisp.  The sandwiches were better than average but not as great as we expected.  The grilled chicken sandwich needed a little more flavor.  My wicked chicken was more messy than I prefer with the juice soaking through the bottom bun before it made it to the table.  The chicken was good though the slaw was lost in the sandwich.    Perfect score for the atmosphere, location, and every nonfood related item.  The biscuits alone are worth a trip.  The sandwiches could have been better but they gave a reason to plan a return trip.  We will be back to try some of the other tasty options.",

Asked for a couple of tap beers, to find out there was no tap. Ordered food and waited a whole lot more. Finally the food came and the chicken was a dry heaping mess. Place was pretty empty so they couldn't blame it on overcrowding. The rest of the families food was very average and a bit pricey for service and quality. Was looking forward to finally getting to this place, and was severely let down. I felt like we got there at closing and got the leftover scraps of the day, the only exception was instead of being rushed out, we had to wait a long time to get pretty marginal food",

Three other people I was with got this dish it came highly recommended.I really like the decor to be in a southern restaurant where the fans were old school. They can hire more people. In addition if you order a salad expect iceberg Lettuce (fake and man made lettuce). I wouldn't expect that from a restaurant that wants to embrace made from scratch, fresh, and original.",

    "text": "While visiting Charlotte, I was drawn to Tupelo Honey based on local reviews. We arrived near noon on a Sunday and were informed that it would be about a 45 min wait. Completely understandable for the time and day. Fortunately we were welcomed to hang out by the bar and grab drinks while we waited.  At about the 45 minute mark, we were alerted and seated. The waitress was in training and very welcoming! We placed our orders and about 10 minutes later, our drinks and biscuits arrived.   The biscuits were fantastic! We enjoyed ours smothered with honey and topped with the provided jam. Really got our tastebuds excited for the meal.  The food took about 40 minutes to arrive despite the ebbing brunch crowd. Made me wish we got an extra platter of biscuits or such to better manage the wait. When the food arrived, I was excited beyond belief. I had ordered the fried chicken with goat cheese grits. A dish that was acclaimed in various reviews I encountered. I first went for the leg and wing. They weren't bad! Nice and crispy though the seasoning seemed almost ghostly. Then it was time for the white meat.   My first bite nearly choked me with the dryness of the meat. It made the metaphor of something tasting like sawdust, very True. It was super disappointing. Fortunately the grits were delicious and the homemade pickles were fresh tasting.  Honestly this review would have been three stars due to the long wait for food and the inedible nature of the famous fried chicken. That being said, the wait staff was super courteous and comped me for the chicken when I brought it to their attention. Definitely a nice gesture.  Hopefully it was just an off day because I loved the aesthetic of the restaurant. The wait for food would also have been bearable if the resulting meal blew me away.   Maybe next time I'm in Charlotte, I'll give them another try.",

Try guessing the secret ingredient, it will blow your mind when you find out!",

    "text": "Wow. So disappointed in Tupelo Honey.  Our party of four went for brunch on Memorial Day. We made a reservation for 11:30 and after a short wait, we were seated. On our way past the host stand we overheard a group being told they could expect to wait an hour for a table.   We ordered drinks -- four waters, two coffees, and three mimosas. Water and coffee came out within a few minutes, but the mimosas dragged behind. We ordered deviled eggs to start, and a plate of biscuits and jam followed. We sat at an empty table for half an hour before our entrees were delivered -- over an hour after we were seated. My breakfast sandwich arrived with about half of the ingredients listed on the menu, with cold, unmelted cheese, and with soggy bread. My fries were pale and cold. At this point, we were so behind schedule that it hardly seemed worth getting my entree corrected -- and at what cost? Another 40 minute wait?  Our server stopped by halfway through our entrees and asked if we'd like another round of mimosas. They weren't delivered until after the check came, twenty minutes later. All told, our brunch stretched on for over two hours and I left hungry.  After past pleasant visits here, I wanted to believe that it was just a rough service, but after reading several recent Yelp reviews, it appears that our experience falls in line with a recent trend. Tupelo Honey isn't a new restaurant -- what's up with the pacing? No wonder people have to wait for a table if it takes over an hour to get eggs on the plate.  It was unpleasant enough, but it became embarrassing, as we were hosting friends from out of town, trying to let Charlotte show off as a fantastic city, and this was their last meal before hitting the road. I can't imagine we'll be back.",

Our server Kelsey was amazing, so nice and pleasant. We ordered the rosemary lemonades and they were so delicious! I had to try the fried green tomato appetizer. It was a perfectly crispy and the GRITS were so good! I also got the shoo mercy omelet and it was PERFECT. My friend ordered the spicy cauliflower and I was amazed.

My friend and I went to have dinner here last week and were seated by the hostess and chatted for a bit. 20 minutes went by and we were wondering where our waiter was so we went and got the hostess to ask. Finally a gentlemen came to take our drink order and gave us the biscuits. My biscuit was very hard so I asked for another one. (Received the biscuit with the check after we ate) We ordered our food and were asking about the menu items and the waiter had no knowledge of the menu. We went to order a side with our sandwich and he said that they did not come with a side, when on the menu it states that all sandwiches come with a side... Anyways. We got our food and it was very good. But the waiter never was to be seen again until the check and did not refill our drinks the entire meal. Food was good but service was really bad.",

    "text": "These people are thieves...  My family and I went to this restaurant last week for dinner while visiting friends in Charlotte. We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Prior to going, my sister called ahead for seating and they said they could not accommodate our party of 5. We were surprised by this but decided to try to go to the restaurant anyway because it did not sound busy. We were correct and when we arrived, there were not more than five tables sat. An employee greeted us and walked us to a table immediately. We had dinner and the food was fine. It was not the best meal I had in Charlotte but it was enjoyable.   I got home and realized I had left my designer sunglasses at the restaurant. I had to wait until the next morning to call because the restaurant had already closed. I was off to a flight back home the next morning so I called the restaurant from the airport so that my friend who lives in Charlotte could pick up the glasses. Luckily, the man who answered the phone told me they had my sunglasses. I was so relieved as these glasses were expensive!  My friend told me she would not be able to make it until the following day because she was celebrating the Memorial Day Holiday. I called the restaurant to let them know when my friend would be arriving, as well as her name. The employee who answered the phone stated that they would put a note on the sunglasses and put them in the manager's office. I was so happy and appreciative that the staff had my sunglasses.  Sadly, when my friend went to pick up the sunglasses, they said that they did not have them. I called and told the staff that I was confused that they initially told me they had my glasses and now they don't. I was connected with the manager who was not helpful. She told me that she had not been working the past few days. When asked if she could reach out to the manager on duty at that time, she told me he resigned yesterday. The conversation ended with the manager telling me she would check with the employees who were working that night.   Surprise, surprise, it has been days and I still have not heard anything. One of the employees at this restaurant clearly stole my sunglasses. it is such a disgrace that they had my sunglasses and then they just disappeared. I wish I could do more to recover my glasses but since I live in New Jersey, I have been at the mercy of phone calls and emails. So much for southern hospitality!",

The server had no problem processing all the credit cards and getting every card back to its right owner. It  was nothing short of amazing.  And she got our food out quickly.  I ordered the honey glazed chicken, the Brussel sprouts and the Mac and cheese.  All very delicious and so much food that I had to box half of it up to bring home.  They are known for their hefty biscuits and outstanding jam.  It was impossible to refuse one of those.  They are a bit heavy for me and not quite as good as some other biscuits that I've had, but they are still decadent.  Fun atmosphere, outstanding food, and terrific service.  Two thumbs up and then some!",

They are served with an amazing blueberry compote that is an amazing bonus. Sweet and gooey even with real blueberries inside. The biscuits also come with honey. Then for appetizer we had the mason jars with black eyed pea hummus, bacon blue cheese and pimiento cheese. The hummus is my favorite so imagine hummus plus ground black eyed peas. I know it sounds weird but it works. The pimiento cheese was a close second and was very creamy and good.  For the grand finale I ordered the salmon with carrots and roasted cauliflower. The salon was crispy on the outside and flaky and definitely not over cooked which is easy to do. The carrots were multicolored, roasted and tender. The cauliflower was outstanding and I'm a chorizo tasting oil. Five star meal and the other five guests that sat with me were pleased as well and that's hard to do.",

    "text": "We started with the rosemary peach lemonade. It's tart and delicious and I definitely recommend it.  We had the onion bisque.  It was cream based, pretty tasty but needed extra salt.  If you go to Tupelo Honey, you've got to try the southern fried chicken BLT.  It's perhaps the best chicken sandwich I have ever had.  WOW WOW WOW.  It's delicious and HUGE.  The scald on the chicken is perfect for this sandwich.  The chicken is really juicy and delicious, and the rest of the sandwich went very well.  I've been to THC numerous times and this is the best thing I've ever had here.  Fried okra on the side was only ok, could be dressed up a bit.  I usually get the eggs Betty on a biscuit (HOLY MOTHER this is a delicious breakfast, and with two biscuits total, you are happy to carry your food baby home afterwards).  We got the veggie melt too. Just ok because there was way too much white sauce, and it just seemed uninspired next to the chicken masterpiece.  I've had this one at THC, I have recommended it to vegetarians and heard very positive reviews, and I've enjoyed the veggie melt myself, but much better at the downtown asheville location.  Overall though everything was delicious.  The biscuit they bring you is great, with the honey and jam.  We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I need something, anything, to get rid of the lingering taste of disappointment. Half of a pack of Altoids didn't do the trick.  The worst of it is HOW MUCH I was looking forward to finally getting to eat here... We sat down (the two of us) and were looking over the drink menu when we were approached by our server, who was pleasant enough.  We hadn't made up our mind yet, so water was offered and graciously accepted. The beer menu was decent enough, so we both decided on a beer.  Ten to fifteen minutes later, our two beers arrive and they were quickly followed by a biscuit and blueberries. The biscuit was good, albeit room temperature.  We elected the chicken wings to start- they were quite good, both in size and flavor. I was even more excited for my meal!   I ordered the buttermilk fried shrimp, the french green beans in brown butter with basil and the parmesan shoestring fries with BBQ seasoning.  My boyfriend opted for the meat loaf with benne asparagus and mac-n-cheese.  My first bite was a crispy shoestring fry...... Not one shaving of parm on the pile of slivered potatoes. Not a lick of BBQ season on a single fry on the plate.  Not even a grain of salt! My brown butter green beans with basil had no basil, no salt, no brown butter, and no flavor.  They tasted like canola oil and the green beans you steam in the bag.  The jumbo buttermilk fried shrimp had the ability to be quite tasty. Unfortunately they decided to squirt lemon mayo all over the five shellfish I received. Aioli it was not.  They could have at least used Dukes.  The mac-n-cheese tasted like boiled pasta.  Unsalted boiled pasta, the same consistency of Stouffers but less flavor. The asparagus was to be \"benne asparagus.\" We found and counted ONE single sesame seed on his plate.  The meatloaf was as cold as the seedless asparagus.  I like beer. Especially when I go out.  I can run up a bar tab.  Not an issue here. My beer glass sat empty as did my water, and not once was I offered more of either beverage.   I will not be returning.  Next time I want southern flavor and don't feel like cooking it myself, I'll go back to the Cajun Yard Dog. Those folks know how to do it right, and they are deliciously consistent.",

The average price for a brunch entree was around $17 which is crazy for a casual restaurant with fairly small portions.   $55 before tip for 2 drinks and 2 entrees is excessive, especially considering we had to eat in the bar area at one of those uncomfortable high bar tables.  The new chef thinks very highly of himself, clearly. The \"potato cracklings\" listed on the menu are just home fries.   Very disappointed, to say the least.",

    "text": "I have been putting off reviewing Tupelo for a while now because I have very mixed feelings towards it. My first experience here was awesome! I got the breakfast bowl I think it's called and it was delicious! It had so many different flavor a that blended so well together! I couldn't wait to go back and I did a few weeks later for brunch again and got the same thing! Again delicious.   A few months later I moved closer to Tupelo and I was so excited! I went back a few more times and again, everything was delicious. The service was great and everyone was always nice. I decided that I liked the food and atmosphere so much that I was going to apply for a job, if only I knew what a headache this would be.   I applied and got hired on the spot. I was told ode hear from the manager about orientation by a certain date, didn't hear so I had to call. So I showed up for orientation, it was typical what I expected. Then I had my first training shift all set up. I showed up and the restaurant was closed? I almost turned around and left until I saw someone I knew from orientation. She informed me that they closed to retrain everyone....okay. So I went up expecting to be on the floor training and what I got instead was a 5 hour orientation. Had I known about this, maybe I wouldn't have been so annoyed. No email, no phone call, nothing. The response when I asked- oh I thought you got an email. So I let it go, went through the 5 hour orientation that was paid-plus. Then again had to sign up for my first training on the floor. Apparently they had no openings? Which I don't get, I've worked in the restaurant business for a long time and usually you just match a trainee up with someone working. So again I was told they would contact me, I double checked they had my contact information, they did....but again I was not contacted. So at this point I went through 2 orientations and not being contacted 3 times after being hired. I didn't even bother at this point, I found another job that cared about its new employee it hired.  With all that said, my view of Tupelo has changed. I was less than pleased. It was so unorganized and unprofessional of a business and I could not believe it! Not to mention I did not get paid for my time that I gave up to be at orientation. I've been back once because my friend begged to go there but otherwise I will not be returning. I tasted a lot of the food during orientation and the several times I've been there and it's not that great, a lot is pretty typical and not very \"farm to table\" like it's said to be. And the last time I was there, the servers were all over the place and having private conversations right in front of our table, again unprofessional.   Usually I hate giving bad reviews but I felt it necessary for what I experienced here.",

They have a great mix of both sweet and savory options - I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes app and really just about anything for an entree (especially if it has the wicked chicken on it). You'll get complimentary biscuits with (I think) blueberry jam - THEY ARE SO DELICIOUS. It can get a little pricey depending on what you order, but it's totally worth it in my opinion.   I also really like the atmosphere, it's big and has a open vault ceiling so you get lots of light inside. During peak hours it can get a little noisy, but it doesn't bother me so much here.   A word from the wise: if you plan on doing a weekend brunch here, get there early because by 11am you will likely have a bit of a wait. It's in a fun area though so get your noshing in early and then explore!",

We started with a jumbo crab cake over jalapeno aioli greens and baby tomatoes. The meal also came with a homemade buttermilk biscuit which was out of this world. It was buttery, flakey, and gradually melted in your mouth.  I ordered the tomato cider glazed atlantic salmon with a side of sweet potato fries and a salad.

I ordered the Texas toast grilled cheese, Havarti and Pimento cheese, with a bowl of tomato soup. For some reason this dish was screaming at me. I am really not that much of a fan of the tomato soup thing, but it goes with grilled cheese so well.    G ordered the hamburger (well done) with the side of mac n cheese.   While we were waiting for our order, they brought out what could have been the star of the show. The amazing drop biscuit. This is not your cookie cutter biscuit. Its buttery, cheesy, a little salty, with just a hint of rosemary. Oh I want to jump in a tub of these delicious bundles of heavenliness.  They also bring you the honey and that jam, damn the jam....why are you so good. You just know they have some grandma's in the back making this jam. It taste just like homemade jam. Did I mention the jam???    Ok, now back to the food.  It did seem that the food did take a bit longer than what I would have expected to arrive. The restaurant was not extremely busy, so it seemed odd. We were in no rush, except for the food, and since we have no issues with conversation it was all good. While waiting I ordered the blueberry punch. It was so refreshing and tasted like it could have been an beverage that would have been a great mix of flavors to go with vodka. I'm so old that I remember when vodka did not come in flavors. It was just vodka. You had to flavor it yourself.   The meal came and the presentation was really nice.  G bit into his hamburger immediately and said it was great. I did try a bite and I agreed, even though it was well done, they somehow were able to keep it juicy. He also had the side of Mac n Cheese and this is where momma's Mac n Cheese goes rogue. This side had some kick. It was pumped up with peppery goodness. The only thing this side was missing was the crusty cheesy top that you usually get when you order Mac n Cheese. This side was definitely a new twist on an old favorite. There was also a side salad which was very fresh and colorful. It was topped with sunflower seeds and two of their dressing to try. Next was to dig into my amped up grilled cheese sandwich. The bread was hot and toasty and buttery. The hot inside Havarti and Pimento Cheese was oozing out, a cheesy perfection of a sandwich. I was trying to figure out how to duplicate this at home. Now the tomato soup. It was creamy, but not your typical Campbells retro creamy stuff. This soup had little bits and pieces of tomato in the soup. The soup was hot and amazing and wait, I don't even like tomato soup but this was so good. They give you such a large bowl there is no finishing the soup unless your just ravenous. I did find room for all of the sandwich. Not a crumb left on the plate.  I would be giving this visit 5 stars, but the wait time for the food was a bit on the lengthy side. Did I mention the biscuit and jam? Just go for drinks and biscuits and life will be perfect, or at least seem that way.",

    "text": "Tupelo is a long time favorite. When I learned it was moving to Charlotte I was stoked! Though it has been no replacement for the real deal in Asheville, it's been pleasant to have Tupelo here.   Yesterday for Mother's Day our family went for lunch as we did last year. They did a great job with the reservation and the people we're pleasant but that's about the end of it.  We were very disappointed in every other aspect of our long journey. I first noticed the menu was not what I was accustomed to, seemed more limited and less of the southern \"Tupelo\" vibe we love.(When did Guacamole Toast become a Southern Food and Carolina Mountains tradition?) While we were seated on time, once we ordered our meal it took over an hour to actually get the food. I understand being busy but an hour for our order is ridiculous. Meanwhile the AC was freezing us out, but we had plenty of time to go outside and thaw, despite our several requests to turn the AC back. Once the food did arrive there were a several misses from what was ordered but after waiting an hour we ate what we could and got out if there. What we did eat was not great and a couple of us had digestive \"challenges\" that evening. I've never said that about Tupelo.  Afterwards we saw the sign outside about a new chef. Not sure if that's the reason for the not so Southern menu changes and poor execution but something is definitely off.   I really want Tupelo to do well but it seems things are going downhill after comparing our experience with some of the recent reviews. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. PLEASE BRING BACK THE TUPELO WE LOVED.",

    "text": "I just don't get the hype or the long brunch wait time.  Why is everybody clamoring to eat here?  I have a lifelong love affair with brunch and to top it with outdoor patio dining is dropping a cherry on my brunch sundae.  But both times that I've been to Tupelo have left me wishing that I had that egg McMuffin, breakfast burrito and Krispy Kreme glazed donut (my on the fly, tried-and-True backup weekend sweet and savory breakfast) instead.  Tupelo gets 2.5 stars but I'm rounding down because I'm literally stunned by the 4-star rating for: (1) fabulous ambience (4.5 stars); (2) long wait time (2 stars); (3) better than average service (3.5 stars); and (4) REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food (2 stars).  _____Fabulous ambience.  Tupelo feels like how I would imagine it would be to visit a Southern aunt or grandmother who baked pies, fried everything that you could imagine, and when she wasn't baking, she was making quilts; it's rustic and meant to feel welcoming and cozy.  The patio is enclosed and tucked away behind some mature trees to facilitate your immersion into its Southern charm.    _____Dreadful wait time.  You can't book a reservation on Open Table until 12:30 and let's be honest, by then that's not brunch, that's just plain old lunch.  It is noteworthy to mention that they can't serve alcohol until noon, on the dot.  To their credit, the wait does move along pretty quickly and they overestimate the wait time so that you're pleasantly surprised when your name gets called ahead of schedule.  _____Better than average service.  Our server was upbeat, super friendly and attentive.  However, his recommendations weren't very good (see below); when we asked for extra mustard (our chicken BLT was very bland), it didn't come until AFTER our meal was almost over; and when we told him that the best thing we had on the menu was our pineapple tiki drink, as he cleared away our nearly full plates after we declined to go boxes, he didn't give the 5-star Yelp spiel that we overheard him giving to all the other patrons (in fact, he didn't mention Yelp at all) and didn't really do anything or offer any conciliatory gesture or at least communicate our discontent to a manager.  ______REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food.  Tupelo is southern cooking with an unexpected twist but its delivery leaves you wanting more flavor, less charring.  I've been twice and both times I was wishing I had that egg McMuffin or Krispy Kreme donut instead.  I've had:  GOOD: ++++++pineapple tiki drink: It's $23 and meant for 2 and pretty heavy on the alcohol.  It's delicious and refreshing but wish they would have given me the pineapple that was cored out to enjoy. ++++++Bloody Mary: the vodka pour is pretty heavy handed; this is a hearty drink and very flavorful. ++++++complimentary biscuits:  the biscuits are served warm with raspberry jam and honey.  They're sweet and fluffy, especially with the jam and honey but I wouldn't say they are better than Red Lobster's biscuits. MEH: --------fried chicken BLT.  The chicken was dry yet greasy and bland but overall, the dish was edible. --------beet salad.  The sweet, tangy dressing, cheese and candied nuts are a nice touch to the salad. --------signature salad.  Wish there were more apples because the greens are a little bitter; the sweet vinaigrette goes nicely with the tartness of the apples.  The croutons are made of corn bread so they're a little sweet.  --------Eggs Betty.  The hollandaise sauce was pretty bland but is better after salt is added. --------shrimp and grits. Tried this because it's a signature southern dish but it was underwhelming and bland.  The shrimp was chewy and rubbery; the sauce was spicy but otherwise not very flavorful. AVOID: --------Appalachian shrimp: the shrimps are supposed to be infused in sweet, semi spicy chili sauce dressed on corn souffle.  Everything tasted charred and the corn souffle was just soggy corn bread. --------okra.  The okra was charred and very greasy.  The buttermilk dipping sauce isn't as salty and flavorful as Ranch dressing, which would have tasted better. --------Brussel sprouts.  Charred, super dry, bland and very greasy. --------mac and cheese.  Dry and not cheesy at all.    Overall, every time I have been here, I am remorseful for the money I spend eating here (which is usually around $65 for 2 people, before 20% gratuity) because I could have my egg McMuffin and Krispy Kreme for less than $10.  I don't mind shelling out that amount if the experience is better than McDonald's and Krispy Kreme, but sadly, it is not.",

    "text": "Wow!!!  I visited this place today with my new colleague.  I was so impressed with the service (William-Waiter Extraordinaire) & the General Manager (David-True Culinary Wizard).  It was very balmy out, so we decided to sit in side.  There was a buzz in the air!  We were greeted by a very nice hostess who sat us promptly.  Our Waiter-William has such engaging personality.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu.  What was so important to me was that he listened so attentively to my dietary needs (Gluten and Dairy Allergies). I ordered the Salmon(Grilled) was served with carrot and kale slaw with avocado lime vinaigrette.  I also ordered the Appalachian Corn Souffle.  William came back to our table with David and they shared with me that the Souffle was not dairy free. I was so impressed by the professionalism and detail to my dietary need.  David said he would make me String Beans with Garlic.  This most definitely should be on the menu! The string beans were flavorsome.  It was an explosion in my mouth.  First, you have the crispiness of the beans, next the fresh basil ribbon, the sweetness of the garlic, and the garlic oil left us talking about throughout the meal.  I shared with my new colleague.  The Salmon was so very fresh, very light, grilled to perfection.  This is the best meal I have had in Charlotte.  William, our waiter was so very accommodating, amazing service, and a pleasure to speak with. My colleague had Fried Chicken Salad.  He said it was delicious.  After our meal, I visited with David and shared with him this was by far \"The Best Honey Tupelo's\".  He visited our table one more time and I asked what was the secret to the string beans.  He said with smile, it was a secret.  We thanked him and William brought our check.  We left with a big smile!  We were walking to our car and we see David runs to us.  He caught up to us in the parking lot and presented me with this beautiful cookbook based on the recipes and secrets of Honey Tupelo.  I was really taken back.  All I can say is make this priority and visit them both.  I would definitely ask for William the server.  Say hello to David, he definitely made my day!  This truly is the \"VERY BEST HOSPITALITY\"!!!",

The food was nothing above average, and not what I expected for the price. We did not complain about the wait, however the manager came over and removed the meals from our bill.

So we sent back some of it (our kids were starving so they are it anyway) and ours never came back.  26 minutes later and our grilled cheese still didn't arrive.  No one seemed to be caring.  The waitress said it was the kitchen.  There were at least three 'manager-ish' guys around but they seemed much more concerned with getting more people seated than getting the food right.  Not ONE of them noticed that no food was getting out.  Then I got the bill and they took 40% off but still charged me for the food I didn't even get.  One manager was the guy who said 'I'll have your food remade' but never bothered to make sure we actually received it.  He also said 'I can give a discount or take off the food, but not both.'   This was pretty disappointing.  I think I'd be less annoyed if anyone gave a hoot after it was screwed up and made sure it was fixed.  But they didn't.  No one took ownership, not once, and -- new restaurant or not -- someone needs to be paying attention.",

When they were reading to start seating there was a large crowd and no list.. it was a 'who was here before who' to get sat. Not a good start, however everything after that was amazing. Our server was extremely nice and came over very quickly to get drinks/take orders. We both othered the same breakfast.. scrambled eggs, he got grits/sausage I had bacon/potatoes. The goat cheese grits were amazing, the sausage was the best I have ever had, bacon was peppered and good pieces.. potatoes a little greasy but good, the eggs were overcooked for both our liking... the portions were HUGE.. 3 pieces of bacon... the sausage patty was big... we also ordered a side of biscuit/gravy.. we added some of the sausage to it and that really put it over the top. For the portion size the prices are very reasonable.. the set up of the resturant is bright and warm.. good family spot.. would love to go back for lunch/dinner and check out the rest of the menu.",

We were seated immediately and as far as service is concerned, we had no problems. The food was another story. My husband and I decided to go with the Easter dinner menu (three courses, $25 per person). Our appetizers arrived with our food. Disappointing, but we didn't make a big deal aside from mentioning it to our server (her response was, \"I don't know what the kitchen was doing.\") Unfortunately, I think our apps were the best part of the meal (goat cheese medallion and fit to be tied pickled & fried). I had the southern steak frites...completely flavorless and also cold. The potato cracklins were the star of the dish which is sad. My husband had the porterhouse pork chop, which he said was \"just ok.\" Dessert was also just ok. I left feeling like I should have gone to Cracker Barrel where I could've had mediocre food and biscuits for half the price (no offense to CB). There are so many great restaurants in Charlotte, I doubt we will be back to waste our time and money here.",

    "text": "I've been to a lot of brunch spots in Charlotte and wanted to try Tupelo Honey based off the reviews. My first experience was not good, food and service was less than subpar based on the prices. I got the avocado toast and eggs which was literally a thick slice of cold bread and cold avocado spread, some useless greens and eggs (scrambled, which were good). Had reservations at 11:15am sat at 11:20am, food came at 12:14pm. We had to summon our waitress after no one came to take drink orders after almost 10 minutes. Ordered the mimosas which took 20 minutes to get. This place is over priced and the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is the manager did apologize for the service and provided a comp meal for my breakfast since I didn't eat it. Oh the blueberry champagne pancakes were super good and saved me from walking out hungry. Sign up for the email list and they are free.",

Oh and don't forget to overdose on their sweet tea before, during and after your belly busting meal :)",

    "text": "IN SUMMARY: EXCELLENT BRUNCH - MAKE RESERVATIONS IF YOU CAN!   I had never been to Tupelo Honey Cafe before, and didn't realize it was a sister location to at least one other in Asheville, NC. I've always heard great things, but never had an excuse to venture out until recently. I went on a Sunday morning to meet two of my friends for brunch. We had an 11AM reservation, and when we first arrived, there were a few parties waiting to be seated, but we were quickly given a table. I will say, as we left, it was PACKED and there were many parties waiting for a table. So if you can, make a reservation.  Breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal - period. I love anything breakfast, but when I go to brunch I usually get the 'everything' meal (eggs, bacon, pankcakes, etc...). If I don't do that, I will get the eggs benedict. I decided to go outside the box and ordered their breakfast bowl. YUM! I would never have ordered this because it's not my kind of dish, but I'd seen a photo online and it looked so tasty. Plus, being a southern fresh food kind of place, I decided to give it a try. I am SO glad I did. It was more than enough food, but it was so good I ate it all up!   My friends both got the BLT sandwich, which they seemed to like, but both complained it was greasy and they needed to wash their hands before leaving. We all ordered coffee - it was good coffee. The goat cheese grits were so tasty. I love goat cheese, but even if you don't like goat cheese, don't let that scare you away. It wasn't strong, it was just savory, creamy & cheesy. No extra salt or pepper needed. While we waited for our food, our waiter brought perfectly cooked homemade biscuits and homemade blueberry jam/jelly. The jam/preserves (whatever it's called) was really good. I'd buy it to take home. I had a few pieces of blueberry in it, but they weren't tough or dry or unwelcomed at all. I liked the pieces. Our waiter was fantastic as well. He was patient when we needed more time and helpful when needed. He was also very attentive and kept our drinks full.  Let me know if this review helped you or if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can.  It was very good - so give it a try!",

There was some mix ups with the food in our party but he took care of everything plus some. From the wings, to the shrimp, to the greens, fish, mac n cheese, and the biscuits man oh man it was really good.   Now as I talk about this next dish I might cry; now I never ever eat Banana Pudding but we had a choice between that and pecan pie as our free desert curiosity of Mr. Castro. At first I ordered the Pecan Pie because like I said I do not eat Banana Pudding but as the desert came out and my sister got Banana Pudding I decided to taste hers. OMG IT WAS SO DEVINE THAT I ASKED TO SWITCH OUT MY DESERT. Omg this is by far THEE BEST BANANA PUDDING EVERRRRR. It was cold and everything had a little bit of everything in ever layer. I want more NOW......... Please do not leave this place without trying the BANANA PUDDING. I will be back very very soon....",

There are so many menu items I can, and do, enjoy!  The food is delicious, fresh, has pure ingredients, and just the right amount of southern authenticity without being all deep fried.  I can have a variety of foods (fish, burgers with gluten free bread, grits, salads, sides) and I have loved each item every time.  They have a good drink menu and specials throughout the week.   I have brought family, friends and grandparents here.  The atmosphere is great and the outdoor balcony is my favorite.  There are occasionally long waits but I find it worth it to go at semi off times and have not had to wait doing that (e.g. Dinner at six instead of 7).",

Upon walking in she was sitting at the bar eating and i presumed she was a customer. I then saw her go behind the bar. Just an FYI patrons don't  want to see their bartenders, servers, etc eat. It's just not attractive and we always wonder if you washed your hands. We continued to get our food which was DELICIOUS, especially the Brussel sprouts. The bartender with the red hair then continued to check on us, but not with the same friendly energy as other guests, and very snotty and used language like \"what, huh\" in an i uninviting tone. She also kept putting her hands to her nose ...which was gross. I just didn't feel the same warm energy that's normally at the bar. Other than that everything was awesome. Sorry for the one star but i spend a lot of money here and love good service and energy, and don't like to watch other people receive it and not myself.",

Day 2 of vaca we came here for lunch. 30 min wait Friday at noon is good sign, however it only took 10 maybe 15 minutes to get a table!  Everything here is locally sourced when possible, even the togo-boxes were cage free!  Coffee was incredible and got better with each sip. The blackened blistered okra was a great rendition of such a simple veg and the portion was HUGE.   We shared the shrimp and grits as another app because we are sickos. I don't know how you feel about grits but this beautiful symphony of corn, butter, prawns, roasted peppers, creole spice, basil and goat cheese will have you ready to slap your gramma and say \"\"Shoot y'all I'm movin to Charlotte!\"   We had no choice but to get the pancake & fried chicken combo. Sounds simple, right? WRONG! I need to meet the madman (or woman) who came up with this creation! Toasted pecans, whipped peach butter and bacon topped this masterpiece of the biggest fluffiest pancake this side of the Mississippi and some of the best boneless fried chicken you can find north of Virginia. Everything was cooked skillfully and the pancake was not shy on the nutmeg.   All-in-all this was an amazing brunch and the food was only outdone by the service.  Jonathan's passion was something restaurants can't buy or force into their employees. As a man who has spent over 15 years in the industry, I can tell you he was genuinely happy here and believed in this establishment. This speaks volumes about Tupelo and I feel good supporting such a place.  You can bet if I come back to Charlotte my first stop will be Tupelo for those grits and the warm embrace of Jonathan's Southern hospitality.",

This place was CRAZY busy, but somehow, you couldn't tell the way the staff here carried themselves and treated us. I highly recommend making a reservation and arriving hungry.   The food was amazing and you can't go wrong with any of the crowd favorites mentioned in 99% of these reviews. I love open kitchens (those always make me feel better) and the music was indie coffehouse chill which I love for a nice meal. My friend and I could speak without yelling at each other and there were large groups all over the place that seemed to have an easy time speaking as well.   I think I got a chance to speak with an owner or manager to help me with my check-in. She was super nice but our waitress stole the show. She was so nice, so patient and I could always see her checking on us and her other tickets constantly to make sure we were OK despite an insanely busy room. If anyone from management sees this, please feel free to message me so we can figure out her name and make sure she wins your employee competition. She deserves it!",

    "text": "My coworker and I decided to go to Tupelo Honey for lunch to grab a quick bite to eat. In the past we've been here before and had a pretty good experience. However, after our experience today we will not be dining Tupelo Honey again.   First, we had issues with both of our orders. My coworker asked for the Mountain Harvest Bowl that has grilled chicken on the salad. The grilled chicken was extremely pink and undercooked so she asked politely for the chicken to be placed back on the grill to be cooked more. After 1 MINUTE a disgruntled server came back out saying this should be cooked to your liking (please note: the chicken is still VERY pink). My food in particular came out wrong as I had asked for gravy on the side of my buttermilk chicken breast. My meal was smothered in gravy and I asked politely for them to take the gravy off only to be met with the same attitude as my coworker received. (Typically I am not one who sends food back but the gravy took up the whole meal.)   When we received the checks my coworkers meal was free (which was great of Tupelo to acknowledge). My meal however was $15.27 and I placed a $20 bill within the bill fold. The server came back moments later asking if I wanted change with an attitude. As a previous server myself this is not something you should ask a customer if they do not say \"keep the change\". I responded that I would like change. I was met with a smirking server coming back to the table looking me dead in the eyes and handing me a $5 bill. This was very uncomfortable for my coworker and me knowing that this was out of spite since I asked for change.   Although all of this transpired I still left him the $5 tip plus my coworker giving him a $3 tip as well. We are overall very disappointed in the quality of the food, but more so the disrespectful server. WILL NOT BE COMING BACK.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with an out-of-town guest. All I can say about the experience is \"meh\"   The restaurant is adorable, their outdoor seating area is wonderful on a nice day. It is a super cute place.   The service is so-so. Sorta slow, we had 2 napkins on our table and it was like pulling teeth to get more brought to us. Our drinks came out 20 minutes after our appetizers. I always find it sort of strange when restaurants do this, I like my drinks first, I ordered them first after all. I understand the bartender may be a bit backed up. But that sorta sounds like an issue with staffing..   Now to the food! Absolutely disappointing. I'm starting to think this place really excels in brunch food, because the lunch food was just unimpressive, bland, and poorly executed.   We tried the fried green tomatoes, we figured it would be fun to try some southern food. Wow were they bland! They sounded so good on the menu with the goat cheese. My god, throw a bit of garlic and some herbs in your breading. They were so absolutely bland, what a missed opportunity. How do you mess up tomatoes?!  The egg salad and avocado sandwich was much the same. It was avocado spread with a sliced hard boiled egg. Everything was slippery so it just slid out of the bread. And again, more blandness. I'm not sure if it's a southern thing but I like for my food to have a bit of flavor to it!   Don't really understand the biscuit with jam for lunch, but the biscuits were truly delicious and flaky.   But I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch. Was not impressed with the food at all.",

Even when I asked for hot syrup it didn't even make my food warm. My bacon wasn't even strips. It was literally pieces and it was burnt! The potatoes were so cold I didn't even try them. My pancakes were also cold. The waiter could see on our faces that we were not satisfied at all. But you could tell she didn't wanna deal with it. I will never go back to the Charlotte location. From the customer service of the hostess that were rude when we came in since we made the reservation at the wrong location to use asking how much longer we had. They just seemed clueless. A few other guest also made the reservation to sit outside and they told them they weren't allowing outside seating and they had to go on the waiting list for 40 mins. Just HORRIBLE. Ordered hot tea and the water was lukewarm... my mom def has more patience than me bc I wanted to go off immediately. Worst brunch experience I've ever ever had.",

Goat cheese grits always hits the spot. Wished it had a bit less pinto beans a bit more of the cucumber salsa. We both had a bit of pinto beans left over in the bowl at the end. Other friend had one of the bloody Marys that came with a whole strip of bacon and chicken and biscuit. I didn't try any but empty cup and plate at end of the meal could only mean satisfaction.

No buttery flavor or flakiness just boring dough. The blueberry jam was ok. Hubby ordered the Shoo Mercy omelette. A put together mess... Fried green tomatoes, pickled jalapeno, ham, bacon, pimiento cheese. Yeah not so great, the collabo does not come together well at all but it looked pretty. I had the Shoo Mercy Pancake. You know I should have had a clue when I tried the dough biscuit! Huge portion and I think that was the problem along with the not so good batter used. Huge cake not cooked long enough, had heavy (not fluffy again) consistency, and then a slight gingerbread/spice flavor not at all like the sweet potato description. Doing too much! FLUFFY Buttermilk pancake topped with the apple cider bacon, fried buttermilk chicken could have been darn near perfect but the moment was ruined with too much going on spice wise. The fried green tomatoes appetizer was ok. Tomatoes had good crust coating but the goat cheese grits, blah. The tang was definitely there but more flavor is needed. Sad to say it's a thumbs down for me",

This one--it leaves a bit to be desired.  They can't really seem to get timing right on when to bring the biscuits which they are known for and the food is either way too greasy or extremely bland. I haven't yet found a happy medium, and I've given it a few chances.  Each time I've gotten coffee which is good but the mugs are so large that it makes it impossible to drink it before it goes cold unless you drink really fast.  I often find myself skipping the coffee there and going to DD across the street after the meal.  I'm not convinced reputation this place has in other spots has made it to the Charlotte location yet.",

The biscuits were nice and fluffy but OH MY GOODNESS why is their other food so terrible? Not only is it poorly made and prepared but it took us an hour to get our food! This wasn't even during their busy hours. Severely disappointed in the food though and will not be coming back a second time.   It seems like there's a lot of hype surrounding this place and maybe because it's a cool casual ambiance on top of a building, but I say don't bother.

Awesome doesn't begin to describe our waiter, Jonathan Hafer. I think \"Excellence\" would be most appropriate, as that is exactly how he served us...with excellence! Jonathan was very knowledgeable and able to guide us through our food choices. We wetent \"waiting\" to see him or have our drinks refilled...he was always there. He didn't miss a beat!  Chef Dave and his team executed with perfection! Our food was cooked to perfection arriving to the table piping hot! I had chicken and sweet potato pancakes...can you say O.M.G! The pancake has real smashed sweet potatoes in the batter!! It was so large that I couldn't eat it all. My son ate the rest of it the next day he said (with his eyes bulging) \"Ma! Where did you get this pancake\"? The others had the meatloaf, curry fried chicken, broiled trout and fried shrimp. Everyone left pleased! Oh don't let me forget...wait for it......the fried green tomatoes....wait for it some more....the fried avocado! Yes, I said fried avocado!

It became pretty clear why people are so obsessed with this place- the food was delicious and the staff was super helpful and friendly. They have a decent number of options for GF and a separate prep area as well.  Highly recommend making a reservation- even for brunch. They book up fast!",

    "text": "Got there on time for our reservation and couldn't be seated due to the long line at brunch Sunday.  Finally got a table and it was sticking out in the aisle. So their staff would walk by and kick the chair or bump into you. Very friendly staff so I will give them 2 stars for that.      They were apologetic for the 1 hour wait for food. So we didn't get our food until almost 1pm after having a 11:45am reservation.  When we did get our food-it was 2 tiny pancakes for the kids menu, and then the sandwich on healthy nut bread was slathered in butter and grilled. No indication of that on the menu. Been sick the rest of the day from the awful heavy taste. So instead of tasting avocado and eggs I could only taste that heavy grilled cheese-that which you'd get at a lower end restaurant. My husband's meal wasn't great either. Maybe the worst meal we've had in months. No comp or free biscuits for the 1hr 15 min wait. I ended all of this by a trip to the ladies restroom. My husband said the men's bathroom was clean but the ladies' room was THE most disgusting bathroom I have ever been to. I mean no toilet paper, no paper towels, 2 stalls for 300 people in the restaurant. So just filthy. Covered in mud and hair on counters. Overall one of the worst experiences I've had between the food, wait, and restroom in Charlotte. They will lose business.  Update: while I appreciate the managing team wanting to speak to me directly, the proper thing to do would be to actually address the issues I stated above internally as it's criticism that should not come as a surprise given the wait time, food taste and cleanliness of the restroom etc.",

Definitely make reservations on Open Table, particularly for brunch. Overall this place lives up to the hype, but I docked a star because the service was a bit slow and drink prices a bit high for what you get. But that comes with the territory for a chain like this. I still highly recommend Tupelo Honey!",

The biscuits - we got them fresh out of the oven and OMG so good. They came with a blueberry sauce and honey. Both were delicious - my husband my have actually licked the bowl the blueberry sauce came in.  Pimento nachos (happy hour size) - so delicious. One of the best things I've put in my mouth in weeks. 10/10 would eat again  Tacos (happy hour - 1 chicken and 1 pork) - the pork was great, Asian inspired. The chicken was good but a little dry. It came with a mustard sauce on the side that the hubs enjoyed (but I don't eat mustard so can't personally comment on the sauce).  Blue cheese and bacon sauce - the chips this came with were great. The sauce itself was a little thin. Prob the only dish we wouldn't re-order if we returned here.  Fried Mac and cheese balls (happy hour size) - delicious. Do yourself a favor. Order these.  Tomato soup - so good! A great spice and heat!  Heirloom tomatoes and burrata - loved this! This came near the end when we were slowing down and were unable to finish but damn.  Fried okra - so good, maybe could use a little more crispiness. This also came near the end and were so full we couldn't finish. RIP.  Request a seat in Bethany's section if you can! She was great. Attentive without being obtrusive and she really knew her stuff.  Solid 4.5 star experience!",

However, I came for an event after work and had the opportunity to try some more goodies.   We started with apps and I tried the tried mason jar dips, okra and honey chipotle wings.  Meh. They were fine, nothing really exciting.   However, I fell in love with the crispy brussels appetizer. The combination of lemon, garlic and bacon and herbs. Then add the side of ranch. Yummy. I could have eaten those all night long.   For my meal I ordered the Shoo Mercy sweet potato pancakes. It was a lot of food! Three pancakes, bacon, eggs, fried chicken and grilled fruit. The pancakes were just okay. The chicken was pretty typical and the eggs and bacon were both standard.   I don't see myself suggesting this place as somewhere I have to visit again. But I'm glad that I did come back and try some additional options on the menu.",

My family came in from out of town. And I was embarrassed that I brought them for an extra basic meal.  The food was cooked in too much butter or oil. The grits were undercooked. My wings started off pretty tasty but some of them were a little pink, and I was disappointed.  I had a cocktail which was pretty tasty.  I might come back for cocktails but definitely not food.  The ambience was nice also. Parking was ridiculous but understandable due to the crowds from multiple establishments sharing parking.   Also, when I made my reservations, they were going so quickly. I tried to call to make modifications but it seemed as though they were too busy to accommodate. Eventually, one of the staff was able to modify my reservation to accommodate two extra guests. Yet when we got there, there were a lot of empty tables and people were not hanging around for a while which you would expect at a popular brunch establishment. Perhaps that is a sign.",

Our date was extremely rushed and made us not enjoy our time there.  I asked if there were drink specials and the waiter said \"no not really everything is just normal\" I ordered a cocktail and was rushed to order house wine (on a Wednesday). I received my bill and my cocktail was half off only $5 and a glass of HOUSE wine on a Wednesday was $9. I would've happily ordered another cocktail if this was waiter would have done his job.  I was uninformed of any nightly specials. What upsets me the most is that I had a reservation and my phone number. why couldn't management call me to let me know? I would've changed our date night.",

However it was the food that truly stole the show.   Each table is presented with homemade biscuits with honey and jam. Perhaps I'm biased since I'm not from the South but these biscuits were worth writing home about! I have never had a starter that was delicious enough to be the main course. My friend and I split the Shoo Mercy Omelet (friend green tomato, smoked ham, bacon, pickled jalapenos and pimento cheese), and the Southern Shakshuka (two baked eggs over goat cheese grits with avocado in a creole sauce). Despite how full I was from the biscuits this food was so insanely delicious that we had to lick the plates clean. I'm a self-proclaimed omelette connoisseur and the Shoo Mercy takes the cake for best omelette I have ever had, and the Shakshuka made me fall in love with grits. I would highly recommend either dish to anyone for brunch.",

We had the following: -Biscuits & jam (this was complimentary and was so good - those biscuits were so fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth good!) -Pulled Pork Sandwich -Mac n Cheese (side) -Southern Fried chicken (with gravy)  -Hush Puppies (with a dipping sauce) -Fried green tomatoes  Everything was absolutely delicious!

The red flannel hash consisted of beets, potatoes, pickled onions, two fried eggs on top, horseradish, and some herbs. I was so full after the biscuits and omelet, I did not get to try the red flannel hash. My SO really enjoyed it, though. He also did not finish it and took it to go.   The restaurant is located on the second floor of a shopping strip. It's cute, casual, and has an open layout. There is an elevator to the left if you don't want to/can't take the stairs.

They come with ranch but are honestly good by themselves.  Soooo crispy and delicious!! And you can't go wrong with their biscuits and jam.  Order the queen Bloody Mary again because that never disappoints! You get to snack on the topping while you wait for your food.

I think a menu redesign would complete the cool package. I've been there a lot just because it's close to work but I always struggle what to order. For the brunch I'll give 5 star but other than that it's 3 star to me.",

I wanted to leave but my relatives did not want to change restaurants.  Second thing that occurred, Holli, seemed to be very aggravated and agitated. She was super slow.  The restaurant was 1/3 full and it took forever.  The restaurant floors were so greasy, an accident waiting to happen. Third, the collards were not seasoned enough and contained no bacon, the biscuits were plain,  Honey dusted chicken lacked honey. We asked for one receipt she brought three receipts. Holli provided the worst service. The restaurant rates a 2 for the food and this lack luster employee behavior.  Needless to say my relatives were not impressed with Tupelo and vowed never to return.",

So after a beer at the second anniversary of our favorite place Pop the Top. (They need a food truck outside) we ventured over to Tupelo Honey. First no one that worked there smiled. No one was glad to see you. Were they prompt yes. Was the service bad, not a bit. However everyone seemed to be just going through the motions. Food, the same, was it bad, not one bit but it wasn't great. It was adequate, like dorm food. Chicken was dry. And the menu was , well boring. Would I go back, well if someone absolutely insisted, but with all the places within walking distance of this place I would suggest we try something more inspiring or at least where they are happy you're there.",

I moved to Charlotte this week and woke up excited for my first weekend brunch #basic. I had been to Tupelo honey in Asheville a few years ago and remembered LOVING it. Sadly, this experience left me disappointed and I will definitely not go back. We got there at 9am and we were sat next to the kitchen/servers station. While I understand you have to make the most of your space, this was literally the worst seat in the house and no reason to seat us there with a third of the seats being empty. Moving onto the food....the javos rancheros was cold and unappetizing. The whole restaurant had a sterile and corporate feel. Nothing like what I experienced in Asheville. To put the final nail in the coffin, the server dropped the check off MINUTES after we received our food with plates and drinks barely touched. Poor form. With all the great food options in this city I will not be returning and I can't figure out why it has such great reviews.",

We've been on a culinary tour of the city & I was stoked to try this place.   We hopped in line & the guy ahead of us was told there was a 20 minute wait. When we stepped up next, I was told \"1 hour 20 minutes.\" Now, coming in there were 2 set & ready tables, and 1 that was waiting to be bussed. I declined the wait list and walked out confused.   The waiter outside asked as we passed his empty tables \"leaving so soon\" and we asked him were his tables reserved. He said they're first come basis, self seating outside and told us to tell the hostess to seat us outside since he's \"wide open.\" I walked back in and reiterated this to the hostess who replied \"I'm only one person\" then asked if I wanted to get on the \"1 hour\" waiting list.   1 how did we get to 1 hour in under 2 minutes? 2 how did we get an hour longer wait than the guy ahead of us? 3 why wasn't she seating the waiter who was available and happy to serve during peak hours?? Because they offer a vegetarian option in addition to all the meat for brunch, I could see this having been a possible favorite for us, but the first experience here was far too poor to ignore. I will not be returning.",

Our server comes over to take our drink/appetizer order. She didn't seem warm at all, and didn't really know which drinks were being served from the menu. Also, when the waitress came back by to take our food order, after a few minutes she came back to say that what my wife ordered was not on the menu that night.. kind of disappointed. Towards the end of our meal I mentioned the email that we received for the free beer glass with the purchase of a signature drink and she said that they were low on glasses but would go check. She then brought back our check but did not tell us if there were any other glasses available. The reason why I am giving this a four star review is because of the hostess at the front and the manager that when asked about the glass gave us a business card to pick it up on another night. Our food was incredible, but the waitress that we had on Saturday wasn't that suggestive or happy.",

    "text": "Okay listen,... this brunch was the bomb!! I was a bit underwhelmed in general by the food scene in Charlotte, but this was my first stop after hitting the city and I'm glad I stayed.  Food: I had the Shoo Mercy Pancake and I was so happy with it. That sweet potato pancake was perfectly sweet and a little bit savory. The fried chicken on top and peppered bacon simply took the dish over the top. I ate just about ALL of it. It was delicious, The only thing that I did not care for were the pecans sprinkled on top of the dish, as I am not too fond of nuts on top of or baked into my food. Luckily, they were whole nuts so I was easily able to chuck them off of the plate and dive in. I also ordered the mega-mosa mimosa, it was nice and strong. They have two mimosa options, a regular sized one in a wine glass for $8, and the mega one in a regular draft glass for like $9..do yourself a favor and get the mega size. It is virtually ALL sparkling wine! Yessss! As if I wasnt stuffed enough from the pancake I could not leave this place without also trying on the complimentary hot biscuits w/blueberry jam. Great biscuit!..Not too doughy, & with just enough crunch on the outside.   Service: Not too shabby. I went alone on a busy Saturday morning and was finally able to weasel my self onto a bar stool to sit after about 20 mins of waiting on the porch outside. I put my name down for a table initially, but was told by the hostess that the bar area seating is first come, first serve, so if I found a seat there before my table was ready, by all means take it. That's exactly what I did. The bartenders were quick and attentive given the volume of orders they had coming in. I was pleased. My food took only 10 mins to arrive after ordering it. That was impressive given the amount of people in the place.  Atmosphere: Nice decor, but honestly I was just there for the FOOD! :)  Brunch is BUSY here and parking is a bit of a nightmare. There is a lot that the restaursnt shares with the other businesses and it fills quickly. I had to stalk someone for my spot! That is probably the only thing that would deter me from returning frequently. Yet and still, I will certainly be back.",

It took a long time to get our drinks and when we finally did, some were missing. To get this corrected took an extra 10-15 minutes. 2 of 7 food orders came out incorrect, and no one in my party was overly pleased with their meal, especially for the price.. Lastly, the bathrooms were disgusting. There was trash all over the floor of the womens room, and there was no toilet paper or paper towels available. They appeared to not have been cleaned in days. It seems that this restaurant is severely understaffed and the quality of service does not align with the prices you are paying for food. Parking is a nightmare as well. I will not rush back to eat here again and I think the 6 other women I went with would say the same.  Oh, and.. the hostesses were less than pleasant. There were a large number of customers waiting for a table with not much room to stand and wait. When trying to get past us we were given a rude \"excuse me\" in a snarky tone of voice - almost yelling, 3 different times in 5 minutes. I understand you are busy and perhaps we are in your way, but I don't think that is an appropriate way to address a customer who made a reservation days in advance and still had to wait 15 minutes for the table.",

I had to go to the hostess after we were sat because we sat at our table for 15 minutes without knowing who our server was. Our waitress disappeared after she took our drink order. She comes back 20 mins later to take our food order. We waited another 45 minutes with empty glasses and no food on the table. I approached the hostess again to speak to the manager. They comped our entire meal. The comp wasn't what we were seeking, but it was appreciated that they did all they could do at that point to make us happy. However, we will never return due to that experience alone. The food was decent, but not enough to outweigh the poor service.",

The place was empty and our food took a painful amount of time to arrive, and I see similar stories on yelp and I've heard similar around town. The QC is finally upping its brunch game and Tupelo needs to catch up.   That being said, there is amazing food on the menu. Sweet potato pancakes or the Mac and cheese might change your life. I love getting a bunch of appetizers to try and drinks in the evening.",

Had the charcuterie, not only was she not able to explain what was what, but said she'd find out what was what, and.... nothing! Once we left our plates on the dirty, empty table next to us, she never brought my gf a new knife. We were never given excess napkins. So we had NONE. And at the price point I was set back when we asked for the remainder of our food to go, and she handed us boxes.   I mean we ordered a solid first round and I got the short rib for dinner, ( the most expensive dish on the menu) and I'm wrapping my own food.  I guess, for fast casual it's pretty ok but, won't be heading back any time soon.  Oh and I think that they should get rid of Rachel!  She SUCKED!!!",

    "text": "Tupelo Honey Cafe lives up to its hype.  My girl friend and I arrived on a weekday early evening and had no problems getting a seat.  Apparently this place is hot as a brunch spot.  Plenty of space inside, though outside was packed since it was nice out.  This place serves up some serious Southern fare.  Service was very nice and we were attended to most of the evening.  Don't come here if you're looking for anything close to healthy, by the way.  Fried Green Tomatoes - deliciously crispy on the outside and slightly tangy (as it should be) on the inside.  Served over their signature goat cheese grits.  Delicious - a must get!  Crispy lemon brussel sprouts - if anything, I would pass on these.  Very fried and not enough lemon flavor, or any flavor at all, really.  Not good if you hate brussel sprouts.  Baked mac and cheese - legit mac and cheese.  What more can I say?  Good ratio of cheese to macaroni.  Tupelo shrimp and grips (added chorizo) - y'all.  The chorizo does it here.  Absolutely worth the extra $3 as it gives the whole thing even more flavor and kick.  The grits, which are the same as in the fried green tomatoes.  The shrimp are large, juicy, plump, well-seasoned, and oh-so-delicious.  This was our favorite dish of the evening, hands down.  But - you have to add the chorizo!  Shoo mercy pancake - basically fried chicken (breast) and sweet potato pancake.  This thing was massive.  The sweet potato pancake was awesome and went very well with the peach butter and of course, maple syrup.  I don't care for thick cut special bacon... just prefer the normal boring Oscar Mayer stuff, so if this is your jam, you'd love the copious amounts of bacon on here.  The fried chicken breast was juicy and crispy and goes well with hot sauce and honey (trust me). This comes pretty close to the shrimp and grits.  Biscuits with homemade jam and tupelo honey - for some reason they never brought these out til halfway through our meal.  YAAAAAAAAS these are amazing, especially with the tupelo honey (the best!) and homemade berry jam.  Pecan pie - skip.  I've had better elsewhere.  Or maybe we were just too full.  Solid place for good service, great Southern food, and groups (on weekday evenings).",

I know some may not consider North Carolina part of the south, (not south enough to be southern but not north enough to be part of the northeast), but I have found that they do southern cuisine well enough to be considered an honorary member!   At Tupelo, I came for the biscuits. Considered by other yelpers as the best in the state, with good reason. It's everything a biscuit should be: layered with buttery goodness. The poppy seeds (pretty sure that's what it was) and blueberry jam just take it to another level. Should have asked for seconds (you know, just to be sure it was safe for the other diners)  The Mac and cheese, simply Wow. These are baked rather than stove top and topped with breadcrumbs.   Also had the tacos. Fried chicken(the greatest food ever) in a taco (perhaps the greatest food vehicle ever lol), with homemade slaw. What is there not to love? Word to the wise: the jalepeno's pack a serious punch.   Tupelo, I shall return",

Nevertheless, once we got our table our waiter (William) acknowledged us and told us he will be with us in a moment being the fact he was waiting on another table. Once he got to us which was no time at all. He offered his suggestions to us and I went with once of his suggestions which was the pancakes with the chicken and my guy ordered an omelet. While we waited he talked us into getting a drink which I got a margarita which was so good and my guy order the 9 oz mimosa and was able to substitute the orange juice for the pineapple juice which I thought was very helpful. With all that being said, the food and the drinks were so good!!! Everything was A1 from the customer service to the food. It was well worth the wait and we will return again!!",

I called 10 minutes later, and they had my purse and even though they were closed, they waited for me to come back to get it.  When I offered them some money, they refused, and this sweet woman said she is just so glad they were able to return it to me and no harm be done.",

I was very impressed and loved it! All i can say is that our server Jonathan made our experience the best! I am a bartender / waitress myself, so i set higher standards for those serving me, and he went above and beyond. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and even let us northerner's taste grits for the first time! We got a Debutante omlet, Eggs Betty, and the Southern Poutine Scramble and plenty of mega mimosas which were delicious! I loved the environment inside, and it seemed like everyone was having a great time. I will definitely be returning and spreading the word!!",

I love the goat cheese notes with the red peppers and shrimp.  It was perfect and I wish I had something left to take home.  I have to find out how to get more restaurants in LA to serve grits and polenta. IJS.   The biscuits and warm honey was a great start. Fried green tomatoes come on a bed of grits.  They were a tad salty for my taste but I am wondering if I am really a fan of the appetizer since I haven't found the FGT of my dreams or if I am holding on to my fondness of the movie (Towanda!).  I am a fan of both the pickled and fried okra. Again, may be looking in LA for a jar of pickled okra sometime soon.  Smh.   The service was great and the ambiance was very upbeat and friendly. Matthew was kind, knowledgeable, patient and attentive.",

The black bean burger is a good option, but needed a little hot sauce to please my taste buds. The Tupelo tofu wings are almost vegan, i believe just depending on your honey stance and are a favorite for the wife.   Their craft beer list is respectable. A few from Asheville (Greenman, Highland), couple from Charlotte, with a few other nice national options. The bar area looked nice, separated from the main dining area. Overall, they seem to be a really good fit for SouthEnd.",

We had poor service, bad food, and the staff was unfriendly. Our coffee tasted old and had grounds floating all in our cups, and the coffee was barely Luke-warm. The waitress never refilled our drinks or coffee (it wasn't good coffee anyway) and only came back to our table 1 time.  My poached eggs were the size of a quarter and tasted like vinegar- yuck, turned my stomach how gross they were! My toast was cold and bendable, very unappetizing! My husband had eggs Benedict and said the eggs were small, overlooked and very lackluster and boring! We ate at Tupelo Honey in Asheville and that place was awesome! Way cooler atmosphere and perfect service, food and service- not in Charlotte- that place sucked! Go to Toast if you want a great breakfast...I would even say Cracker Barrel or Bob Evans is wayyyy better as well!  Don't eat here! Yuck!  Oh, the steps to get up and down into the restaurant are steep and small, a total lawsuit waiting to happen! Don't take any old people there...they have an elevator but it is so slow and not worth the wait!  Like I said, don't waste your money here! 2 thumbs down!",

First, I will say that the food was on-point, the atmosphere was exceptional, and the fact that we didn't have to wait for a table was awesome. But the server we had (and I hope this is not reflective of the entire serve staff) made me not want to go back. Our six water glasses remained empty for the majority of the evening (only being refilled once, when we put all six empty water glasses on the edge of the table), it took 25 minutes for her to return with our second round of beers (after we had to remind her, for which she did not apologize), she took our appetizers away before we were finished with them (and we couldn't ask for them back because she smashed one of the plates on top of the unfinished plate), and she made no apology or excuse for her behavior.   The worst part was when we had gone out of our way to order a surprise piece of pie to be the birthday dessert of a member of our group -- we were there for a birthday dinner -- she said she would try to find a candle, and not only did she not find a candle (which is fine), but when she brought the pie over, she didn't give us a chance to sing or do anything because she just plopped it down in front of the birthday girl and walked away.",

    "text": "Hah!  Like Giannabrie, I too kinda drink the THC Kool Aid and have been salivating for the restaurant to open since the Charlotte location annoucement was made a few months ago.  Let's just say if you're a fan of the Asheville location, this location IS different, but won't disappoint.    The food is very similar, and I believe consistent to what you find at the original.  (Pillowy biscuits and blueberry jam packed with whole fruit...those famous sweet potato pancakes the size of your head with crunchy pecans...oh yeah!)   What won me over were the servers and bar staff who knew exactly what each menu item included and weren't afraid to make recommendations. The staff is very friendly and even with a packed house on two occasions, we still felt attended to, and our needs met.  (Once, I was on a time crunch of an hour, and despite a completely full bar area, our server made sure our food came out quickly, and our bill taken care off within that 60 minute window.)   Note:  No reservations taken under I believe it is 6 or 8 people.  Their first week they also didn't accept phone carry-out orders...you had to go in and order in person, and wait at the restaurant.  That was a bit irritating.  Note 2: Parking can be tricky during peak hours, (Liberty is in the same plaza, along with other businesses) so plan accordingly.   Bottom Line:  If you're a fan of the other locations...and enjoy their style of Southern cuisine, put this on your list.  It's a great go-to for Breakfast, lunch or dinner. I also think it's a good place to take out-of-town guests for a real taste of the Carolinas.",

I could tell you what all is good with detail, but honestly everything I have ever had here is flippin' fantastic. I'm talking waddling out the door with a food baby good. I've taken a couple groups of folks here and they have all thoroughly enjoyed it as well. This could be a great place to introduce out-of-towners to southern cuisine being that it has some classics along with some modern interpretations. Tupelo is a local spot and honors seasonal foods which means the menu is always changing and the food is always fresh.  In Essence: + Amazing food! (local, fresh, seasonal) + Fun cozy atmosphere + Friendly Staff + Great pricing + Group friendly/Good for visitors -Parking challenges at times, but at least it's free.",

We also got the Ham Wonton which reminded us of summer.... My husband tried the Shoo Mercy shrimp and grits with chrizo sausage.  Creamy and savory with a bit of spice! I enjoyed the Sweet potato pecan pancake with chicken. It was sweet and light. The chicken was cooked to perfection!  During our entire meal Sam offered suggestions of meals, was attentive and courteous. This is a man who truly enjoys his job. He was knowledgeable about food and cocktails. This is an employee whom I would hire to work for me.  He was by far one of the best people I have ever had the pleasure to wait on me in any business transaction.

My boyfriend had the fried green tomato BLT - also delicious.   Love the decor and all of servers and hostesses were courteous and attentive. I would definitely recommend Tupelo Honey for a yummy weekend brunch but get there early or else you'll most like face a wait.",

The service was extremely slow to begin with. After taking 30 minutes to get waters and our drinks ordered I found the manager to let her know. She either didn't do anything or didn't have the resources to do so. From then on the experience got worse. Many of the items people ordered weren't available, particularly the vegetables which makes vegetarian dining difficult. The service continued to be slow and felt inhospitable. We made this reservation well in advance. Your team should have been proactive about staffing for a large group and making sure we were well taken care of. In reality you let one server struggle to take care of our table while also tending the bar and serving other tables. We noticed a number of tables that were dirty when we arrived and dirty when we left. For a place that is charging $20+ a dish it felt like we were eating in a school cafeteria.",

Yes, we made reservations and it didn't take long for us to be seated. The food was great and my Southern roots were well satisfied. If there's anyone looking for Southern food with a twist this is the place to go. Upon reading the cookbook about the chef, I was happy to know about how much our childhood had in common. I cook often at home and would not eat Southern food outside of my home, but this has changed. I will pay top dollar to eat here again. I had the fried green tomatoes sandwich but I sampled my families FRIED CHICKEN, and CATFISH. It was delicious. You must try the MACARONI AND CHESSE!!!!!! It will make your grandma cry!

Some of my favorite items are the grilled okra with ranch, fried green tomatoes, open faced honey fried chicken sandwich, anything fried chicken related, their gravy, and their Rosemary peach iced tea!  Still plenty more to try at the restaurant. I've had the steak and eggs, but found the steak to be too seasoned/marinated for my taste. (I liked a simply seasoned steak) But it was good and my boyfriend loves it.   Definitely one of our go to restaurants with great service. It's loud inside and coooold. But we love sitting in their outside area and listening to the rain.",

If you've ever visited the (What I believe to be) original location in Asheville, you know why this place deserved the hype and long lines when first adding a location in the QC.  A new restaurant with a big following/fan-base, is bound to have issues with service, wait times, and some food items not coming out right.  However this place has had years to fix their issues and they just seem complacent in providing 2 star service and 3 star food at 5 star prices.  I live to eat, not eat to live, so I'm cool with dropping a pretty-penny on brunch, lunch, pretty much any unch.  But none of our most recent trips here have been enjoyable/worth the spend.  I hope they fix their issues with service and food being delivered in a timely fashion whilst accurately portraying what was depicted in the menu.  I'd like this place to survive but service is king, especially in the queen city - there are better places to leave my 30%.",

I started off with the Moonswine Mary, a 16 oz. jalapeno-infused moonshine Bloody Mary with bacon garnish. Just the right amount of spice from the pepper, and you can never go wrong with bacon.   For eats, I decided on the Super Southern Breakfast Bowl. Layered black-eyed peas, grits, eggs, bacon, cheese, and salsa. I'm not a big fan of peas (it's a texture thing) but everything was delicious. The grits were just thick enough, the eggs were great, and the two thick slices of bacon was a perfect addition.   My fiance got the fried chicken with a side of fried okra, which both were out of this world. The okra was fried just enough to still retain it's crispy crunch and the chicken breast melted in your mouth the the creamy milk gravy.   My brother got the Southern Fried Chicken BLT, which was HUGE! Mostly had to deconstruct and reconstruct it to be able to eat, but he had no complaints. He also opted for the fried okra side.  Sister-in-law got the Shoo Mercy Pancake. It came with candied pecans on top, which were not listed on the menu, so she removed those, but everything else was great with hers.   Would definitely recommend, and will definitely be back for more at some point. Only reason it is not five stars is it took a while for our food to come out and to get our checks. We were seated right beside the waiters' computer, so it's not like we were tucked away in a corner, so that was somewhat frustrating, but I'm sure not a common thing for this restaurant.",

When I finally did get my food, 54 minutes later, it was barely luke warm and my \"grilled cheese\" had ONE piece of cheese and overly dry/toasted bread. I came in with only one other person and so excited for a good lunch and break from work and left with an empty stomach and bad taste of dry bread.

Service was simply meh and unresponsive (slower than it should be and not organized).  Onto the food.  I had the carnivore breakfast pie with a side of breakfast potatoes, that was so bad I couldn't eat it.   The meat appeared to be one slice of thin low grade ham lunch meet diced up and spread through a scrambled egg baked in a pie crust.  The eggs were over cooked to a rubber texture, and the pie crust was too thick and dry to be served in a 4\" tart shape.  I tried adding ketchup, then mayonnaise, then syrup.  Nothing seemed to work, so I only ate the potatoes, which were simply ok.   The only reason I give them 2 stars, is because the biscuits they bring to the table may be in the top 5 in the city.  However, if you are going for breakfast, just get the sweet potato pancake as it was the only good thing served at our table.",

I was there with a party of 6, and everyone felt the same about their meals -- even my very picky son who devoured the grilled cheese.... Crust and all!   The service was fantastic. We had a reservation, and it was ready for us when we arrived, despite how busy they were. And our meals came out very quickly also.  It felt like almost no waiting... But maybe that was the sample plate of pancakes they brought to the table, or the fried green tomatoes appetizer.  When we were leaving, we saw some gift items we wanted, and the staff was incredibly helpful and nice. They even showed us how to sign up for the mailing list to get a free item.  Definitely worth going, and going again!",

Overall, I thought this restaurant was great!!!  We were a party of 6 on a Saturday night, and although it was crowded, we were seated within 20 minutes. All of our drinks were great; we had wine, margaritas and other mixed drinks. The drinks were strong enough for the price and well sized.  Everything you read about the biscuits is True: they are AMAZING. Best biscuit I've had in a long time; possibly in forever :)  For entrees we tried the Chicken Piccata w/shrimp, Shrimp and Grits, Grilled Cheese and soup, the Veggie Bowl and the Veggie platter. Portion sizes were great and the food was excellent!! We laughed because there was literally not a single crumb left on any of the six plates. Other than licking them clean, we each ate every last bite!!  For dessert we ordered the banana pudding: it's EXCEPTIONAL!!!! Seriously, between the biscuits, entree and dessert, we left very full!  Best part was the bill; $76 for 2 people including 4 drinks, 2 entrees, dessert and tax. To me, that's a great value in Charlotte!  Thanks for the wonderful night out: we will be back (next time for breakfast) :)",

    "text": "This quaint and homey restaurant, while boasting an appealing menu, lacks in a variety of areas. But I'll start with the positives. While others boast poor service, we had quite the opposite. Our server was attentive, checking on us at just the right intervals. Waters never ran empty, and he was kind in his approach. We started with a pimento cheese appetizer. Honestly, this didn't taste like any pimento I've ever had and not in a good way. The flavor was lacking, and there was a heavy granular texture. The pickled jalapeno went well with it, but I would have liked that taste to be incorporated into the cheese instead of on the side. The chips were overly salted, which also muted my taste buds to any flavor the cheese might have had. Served alongside the appetizer was a corn meal biscuit with warm honey and blueberry jam. While the biscuit was a bit dry, the honey compensated for this. The blueberry lacked in sweetness, but this was actually a plus side. It also paired well. I had the Charleston Chicken sandwich, which was decent. The bread was a little over-buttered, but other than that the chicken was moist and the Havarti cheese was a perfect choice. On the side was the lemon quinoa, which was overpowered by the extremely ripe blueberries. If I had a bite without a blueberry, it was perfect. An odd note, but if the blueberries hadn't been so ripe they would have worked nicely. My partner had the Fried Chicken BLT. Honestly, it needed a bit more of the honey dijon as the flavor in the chicken was muted by the bread and tomato. The chicken alone (out of the sandwich) was extremely tasty. The breading was on point and the chicken was moist. However, his side item (the Southern Style Greens) should have been labeled 'Chinese beef and broccoli.' Of course there was no beef, but the greens were so thoroughly swamped in sauce (a soy base I took it) that any flavor that the greens had themselves was lost long ago.   All in all, I might go back every few months. I definitely wouldn't get the same thing, as their dinner entrees looked more appealing after all was said and done. Not a favorite spot of mine, but not terrible by any stretch. Seems like a nice place in good weather to sit outside, have a Happy Hour drink, and enjoy a small app or split an entree.",

The food came out wrong and took excessive time to get and then was mediocre at best. Just an overall terrible experience and I will never go there again. To any of the locations. It's just not up to the hype. Or price.   If I could give less stars I would.",

    "text": "There are places all over the South, where venerable old recipes have been handed down through the generations until absolute perfection is achieved. Tupelo Honey has become the quintessential example of slow, Southern culinary charm...delivered at a blistering 21st Century pace.  Absolutely charming menu, choices galore...and everything possible is locally sourced for quality and freshness. Our server Jonathan, presented with a sincere and cheerful greeting, immediately suggesting the top of the brunch items...while immediately taking our beverage order. While we've been to the Asheville, NC locations, I decided to let Jonathan \"sell\" me on the menu...and actually, he led me with enthusiasm, knowledge, and personal experience....to order a completely different dish than I originally planned.  We all know, poor service can wreck a great kitchen. Conversely, a great server can deliver a memorable dining experience.  Jonathan is simply great with people; sincere, patient, and very knowledgeable. (*full disclosure - not related in any way to Jonathan or Tupelo Honey)  MUST try the fried chicken breast on a pancake with spiced pecans, apple cider bacon...called Shoo Mercy Pancake....unreal!  The original Asheville location is still my favorite - but happy to see the restaurant move mainstream while keeping to it's roots - creative menu, incredible quality, and great service!  Go often!",

    "text": "Ok so first time visit today, it was very empty...probably due to the Panther playoff game.  We had no wait for a table.    Service: Average at best.  I had to remind my waitress twice to bring me lemon for my tea.  And while we are on it, the sweet tea, was fab..however the waitress kept topping me off with WARM sweet tea.  Yeah, by the end of our meal I had tepid sweet tea, but i did eventually get my lemons.  Food: Here's where I'm torn.  I will probably revise this rating when I go back.  The biscuits, yum, scrum-dil-ioucious.  The Appalachian egg-rolls...well,they were very mushy inside.  The first bite was not very good, but when I got going they were tolerable, to pleasant...but the texture inside was mush, that is quite offputting.  My friend got the sweet potato pancake.  It is HUGE!  And she said it was good.  The mashed sweet potato side looked ordinary.  Now onto the reason why I'm so torn...I got the garlic chicken.  It is served with mac and cheese and a swish chard/asparagus side.  My entire plate was covered with grease.  Unsure where it was coming from.  Everything tasted good, but the grease was really off putting.  The chicken was very very garlicky.  I liked that, but in addition to being very garlicky, the topping was also incredibly salty.  Like almost inedible for the regular person.  I could do it b/c I like things on the salty side.  So at the end of the day I'm rating this place 3 stars.  I will most definitely be back.  So stay tuned.  Based on the hype I'm expecting my revised rating to be higher than my first visit.  We shall see.",

    "text": "We got food to go which I am generally skeptical about. I got the pork grilled cheese sandwich. It was the perfect balance between sweet and savory- mostly savory with a slight hint of sweet. The bread could have been crispier but that could also be due to the fact that we got it to go. The potatoes au gratin were just okay. More creamy than cheesy in my opinion. My grandmother got the shrimp and grits and said it was okay. (She had a French restaurant once rated in the top 3 restaurants in NC so she is quite critical). She gave it 3 and I gave it a 4. I think if we had eaten there it would have earned a 4. I'll definitely be going back!  I went back with my parents and was very impressed. We came for brunch around 11:30 and there was a wait for over an hour. We ended up eating at the bar and I was very impressed. My past experiences eating at a bar have required fighting for the attention of the bar tender. Lauren was incredible, she regularly checked in on us regularly and even had a nice conversation or two with us.   The food was amazing. To start, they give you biscuits (free)which were very tasty. I topically find biscuits to be dry and bland but these were slightly salty, and moist. I got the sweet potato pancakes for my main course which were really good. The fried chicken was nothing special though but I love some good sweet potato pancakes.   My mom got the mountain harvest bowl. She said it was a perfect combination of flavors. She said she would definitely get it again.  My dad got the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich which is my favorite dish. The French fried he got with it were slightly soft which is exactly how I like them. But about half of them were in that perfect medium between soft and crunchy. He thought the sandwich was a creative combination on pumpernickel bread that was very good.  I recommend making a reservation if you plan to eat here.",

I visited TH with a friend during one of Charlotte's latest rainy weekends, it was busy but not packed. We made a reservation, arrived at 12:30 ish and waited no more than 10 minutes.  The service was kind and friendly from the host stand to the those who came to the table. We ordered mimosas (seemed over priced to me). Biscuits come on the table (they weren't particularly warm).  We ordered an appetizer, the fried green tomatoes. They were a little cold, grits needed salt (there was salt on the table) and the red sauce was really delicious. The kitchen was very slow that day. When our main courses came out they were hot and I really enjoyed the fried pickled eggs benedict, but I wish it had had more fried pickles. I don't think my friend and I walked away wow'd like we'd hoped but it was A-OK.",

I should say I had very high expectations from previous visits and though I still love the concept and the decor, it kinda felt like the whole place could use a good scrubbing, starting with the grime around the door entrance handles. Floor felt sticky. There was trash around the downstairs elevator entrance (my mom uses a wheelchair). Somebody had spilled something or thrown up at the bottom of the stairs leading to the parking lot. Sure hope I just hit them on a bad night. The blueberry mojito was quite good.",

In the reservation I had noted that I would like outdoor seating because we were going to bring our dog. I had also called the day of to confirm that dogs were allowed on the patio.  Upon arrival, we were seated at a table that was in a puddle of water... our dog had no place to sit and my boyfriends shoes were soaked. (There were tables available without a puddle of water...) I attempted to use a squeegee that was laying out to clean up some of the water. I ended up taking our dog back to our place nearby because there was no where for him to lay... while my family enjoyed appetizers.   The food was very average. I'm glad that I got a mimosa at least..  Why would the hostess sit us at a table in a puddle of water, especially when she saw we had a dog. Also, why wouldn't the management attempt to clean up the water before guests arrive.",

However, this place is walking distance from my home so we gave it another shot. We won't go back.   We waited 20 minutes for a table despite that fact that there were countless open tables. When we inquired about the many open tables, they told us it was a kitchen/service issue rather than a space issue.   We were seated indoors by the bar. It was freezing, and we immediately inquired as to why it was so cold. The server told us they had to keep the temp super low to avoid a humidity issue in the bar area. Umm what?   We had a server in training and a tenured server assisting. This was annoying as the individual in training would ask if we wants apps of cocktails and we'd say no all while the tenured server observed from behind. Then the tenured server would coach the newbie in front of us \"did you ask about apps, what about offering a mimosa.\" We felt this should not have been handled in front of us.  When the AC issue became unbearable we asked to move. They finally found a spot for us in the main dining area and we were shocked to find it colder so we moved back to the bar area. My father-in-law was ready to leave (food hadn't even arrived yet), and then the tenured server informed us the kitchen was very backed up.   Our food finally came and it was good. We expected an apology for the extreme AC issues, but received none. And we weren't the only ones who found it could - we saw numerous people go to their cars for blankets or coats and others asked to be moved outside. The restaurant needs to fix the AC problem ASAP.   Overall, I've had 2 poor experiences here for 2 totally different reasons. The food is good, but I believe this restaurant is poorly managed and I will not be dining here again.",

Service has always been kind of \"OK.\"  Every time we've been we've had to ask for biscuits and every time we get the same answer: \"Oh yeah they are just coming out of the oven.\"  This last time...the service was just terrible.  Out of the cocktail special, out of the red wine special.  When we did get the cocktail we ordered, it took 15 minutes to get to the table (and the place was empty).  When we got the bill at the end of the night, we saw that our waitress took it upon herself to order us the most expensive glass of wine - we checked the menu and there were several happy hour glasses of red wine (again she said they were \"out\" when we ordered).  When we said something, we basically got the equivalent of a \"whoops\".    Not sure if there is a manager here...but we certainly didn't see one.    This place MIGHT be worth it for brunch (despite the service), but definitely not for dinner.",

The biscuits are a nice starter: crisp exteriors but slightly undercooked centers and served lukewarm like they've been sitting for a bit.   Taking a trip down south, I felt like the buttermilk fried chicken was a must. Plus the lunch order comes with two sides. The chicken itself I really enjoyed: crisp and tender, not that hot but the gravy complements it nicely. The sides though were disappointing: the Brussels sprouts were relatively bland and mostly char, while the mac and cheese would've been better served with a different cheese and less breadcrumbs.",

I have been to their location in Knoxville and was hoping for the same great food I had received there--We did not.   My boyfriend got the chicken biscuit, and I got a combo. We both split the fried okra. To start off with we didn't have silverware when we sat down. Once we put in our order for the okra within two min (I'm not kidding) it came out. Normally I would be impressed however the dish was room temp and old tasting (like it had just been sitting on a plate waiting for a table to take it). After that we didn't receive biscuits until AFTER our entrees arrived, which seemed weird because my boyfriend's dish had three biscuits in it (?). Anyways, my four sides were just fine, but his serving was very very small, and the chicken was just average, not crispy or fresh. Not at all what we were expecting for the price they charge.  Overall, the food was OK but not $50 for brunch OK. We were quite disappointed. I will say that our server was very nice despite being slammed with tables. We will not return to this location. There are far too many places you can get a better, bigger meal for much cheaper.",

I asked for scrambled with cheese but it was really more of a slap of a piece of cheese on the top which in the end was an additional 1.00 charge. Mimosas were good but 11.00 is a little pricey.

I understood since it was a Saturday, but was confused when a family of four came in and was seated right away (they didn't have a reservation and the waitress immediately took them to their seats). There were so many tables open outside (ones for two and four people) and inside the cafe so I don't understand why we had to wait 30 minutes for a table that had been open the entire time. When we were seated, the service was absolutely terrible. No silverware, no attention from the waiter, and took forever to even order drinks. Once we finally ordered and got our food, the food was just alright. The biscuits that came out beforehand were okay. I got the breakfast combo with eggs, bacon, and sweet potato pancakes. My meal was just alright, I didn't feel as if there was anything special about it. Even after we were all finished, it took about 20 minutes to get our check because the waiter wasn't checking on us at all. I probably will not be returning mostly because of the terrible service.",

My boyfriend ordered the sweet tea roasted chicken breast with honey glaze. He couldn't say enough about how much he enjoyed it and was was very eloquent about it, which is pretty amazing because he usually doesn't say very much. We also shared a side of the baked Mac and cheese. It was very good and was generously portioned enough for two. I would recommend if you get the chance, to go to Tupelo Honey.",

For my entree I had the grilled cheese and pork sandwich with cole slaw.  I appreciated that their cole slaw wasn't runny and drowning in mayo.  With a southern style place, you never know.  I'm from New Orleans and we love our mayonnaise.  This coleslaw would not cut the mustard back home, but I dig it.  The sandwich was eh.  The bread was dry and there wasn't enough cheese on it to make the sandwich melty and juicy enough.  I ended up pulling everything out of the sandwich and discarding the bread.  Service was good, especially for their being over 20 of us.  I don't think there was a delay on anything.  Before eating, while we waiting for our entire group to show up, we sat on their balcony and were served our drinks while we waited.  It was a nice little spot to relax in.",

Great cocktail menu that isn't overpriced? Check.  You can go here and find something on the menu for everyone. Their food doesn't feel stuffy or heavy.  I have had one disappointing meal here and to be fair, I was forewarned...making the avocado toast gluten free left the heart a little to be desired. Assuming their portions of avocado doesn't change from regular bread to GF bread, it could have used a little, well, more.  They cut the toast into little slivers, and GF bread is always smaller. One modification would have been to cut the bread into a triangle and have left it. I actually sort of chuckled when it came and I was like, \"wow the server is right, this looks pretty dismal.\"   Their side salad is one of the best I have had, it isn't pathetic--it's actually gorgeous. Mixed greens with carrots, a beautiful watermelon radish on top. Oh and their blueberry jam. *swoon* I absolutely love smathering this over toast alongside a mug of piping hot coffee.  If you go for brunch...the potatoes. oh my goodness the potatoes. are like this smashed, but still whole, concoction. I loved them. Great flavor, a few bits of crunchy bits mixed in...mmmm yum.  The wait is always incredibly long. And I will say, I won't wait more than probably 20-30 minutes. If you find yourself up early enough on a weekend to visit, make the trip, otherwise, expect upwards of an hour. And while it's really solid, I just don't know what is worth an hour wait.  Love that this place has stayed True to their roots and has expanded over southern cities!",

The first few times it was stellar. The more I went, I found that it was either a really bad experience or pretty good. It seems like the quality of the food has gone down as of late. The service is hit or miss out of my 12 or so visits here; you're either getting drinks and biscuits you didn't know you needed right as you sit down, or waiting 30 minutes for a mimosa at brunch.   One thing that's always been ridiculous...the wait times. If you're looking to go during the weekend and this is your first trip, you will be terribly mistaken to think you will get a table within any reasonable time frame. Booking a reservation the night before is your best bet, but even then it's not guaranteed you will be seated at the time you reserve. On the other hand, I have experienced them grossly overestimate the wait time (they said maybe 45 mins. and it ended up being 10 mins.).   With all of that out of the way, the food is absolutely Southern inspired and some things are reminiscent of a dish my grandmother would cook on a Saturday morning for me. I have yet to have anything that was just flat out bad, but I have had a couple of things that were WAY overpriced for what you get (mainly the drinks). Their margins are ridiculous, but hey...gotta pay that Southend lease!   By all means check it out, but only if you have a 2-3 hour time span to wait and eat.",

    "text": "We had a lovely breakfast on a Saturday morning.  the southern meets modern rustic charm of the restaurant is very fun and our server Sierra was excellent.  The creative take on southern style fare was different while being deliciously familiar.  Fresh biscuits and honey complimentary as you wait for your order were wonderful.  My huevos ranchero was delicious but The fried green tomatoes with grits, Cajun sauce and basil garnish was the show stopper!    Although is a little on the pricey side for breakfast, it's worth it and if you check in on yelp you earn 10% off.  Definitely recommend Tupelo Honey.",

We had to change our reservation 3 times because I was getting my car serviced and they were taking forever but that's a story for a different day. Tupelo was very accommodating. Our waitress was super nice and friendly. The sweet tea was great. They bring you biscuits to start which comes with honey and jam. I was starving so ate the biscuit but It wasn't the best one I've ever had. They have a great build your own breakfast plate- you can pick 4 items for 12 dollars. I had the fried potatoes, bacon, pancakes, and grits. The food was just warm so I didn't love that. The pancakes were okay- nothing that special. The grits were good and the potatoes were fantastic. Definitely would order them again as a side.  My husband had the chicken with biscuits and gravy and he thought it was good. Certainly a must try for brunch!",

I went with the sweet potato pancakes, which were delicious with the peach cream and pecans and a little bit of maple syrup to make it wonderful. The wait staff was friendly to everyone around me and including myself. I usually eat alone and they even interacted with me and they were also pet friendly outside. Definitely a great brunch for families and couples, especially before noon in the late spring/early summer. Bathrooms and restaurant cleanliness was superb. I will definitely bring my significant other to eat with me here again. What a delightful cafe!   Updated review: Definitely a great brunch place, even on a Sunday afternoon with a 15 minute wait and the omelettes were phenomenal!",

Squash toast was very tasty and savory, although one piece of toast for $13? Rough but something different from avo toast. Overall, great brunch spot",

She's so pleasant that she has sold me on coming back here. I will continue to ask for her for future meals.",

We learned only after our meal arrived that you are supposed to get complementary biscuits and blueberry jam because they were not delivered until after our meals were delivered which took quite a while. I understand they were busy but I work in the service industry and a manager should have at least come by to speak with us.   We decided that maybe they had servers call in sick or quit and maybe were understaffed so we have them another try last week. Our server was much better this time around. We each drank the megamosa while we waited for a table with was really delicious. Our server was much better the second time around but the food was still slow to come out. I think they need to figure out how to speed things up in the kitchen and we again didn't see a manager. (Not that there was anything wrong with our food but I didn't see any walking around to any tables and I imagine if they were that busy someone needed a table visit).   The food was pretty good both times nothing extravagant I would say but we may give them one more chance. For now we will likely stick to some of our other go to's.",

I order the same thing every time since this place is a hike for me to get to. I like the blackened catfish. The fish itself is still good, although the potion size has decreased. The green beans came out cold. The Mac and cheese is really good. The big disappointment was the banana pudding. It took 15 minutes to get to the table even though the restaurant was almost empty and I thought maybe they were putting it together. Nope. The cookie on top was not crisp but was soggy as it the whole thing had been sitting in a refrigerator for hours. And the pudding itself used to have banana chunks in it. This was dense and has lost its charm. I only took 3 bites when I decided it wasn't worth the calories.",

William brought out all of our stuff at the same time so we didn't have to wait on each other to get food, he helped us order an off-menu item, and on top of that he checked up on us all the time to make sure we had everything we needed. One of the nicest and most sincere servers I've had at a restaurant in a while.  The food, as always, was phenomenal and delicious, and the selection of drinks that was available was outstanding.   One great thing too: we missed our biscuits at the beginning of the meal, but we lightly mentioned it to our server and he brought them right out with no hesitation, we also had a small issue with one of our beverages, and that was resolved right away as well.  Great service goes far beyond just getting it right the first time, and fixing a problem with haste, efficiency, and care after noticing is what makes the difference between good and great service.  I couldn't be more pleased with the time I had, and it was nice to enjoy a great meal with my family, who I don't get to see too often.  Thanks, Tupelo (And William!)",

Our server, Bailey, was friendly and knowledgeable and took great care of us. The location in South End is very cool with our table getting a good view of the uptown skyline. Now the food.. I had the Shoo Mercy Pancake which is a work of art. A sweet potato pancake, spicy fried chicken, bacon and nuts with fresh maple syrup. It's like breakfast, dinner and dessert all in one! My wife made a dinner from a plate of delicious sides. Her salad, corn souffle and jalapeno hush puppies looked amazing and she was certainly more than happy with her meal. Another thing I like about Tupelo is their devotion to local craft beers. Several well known Charlotte breweries were represented on the drink menu. Well done!! We will be back ...soon!!",

We were finally seated after an hour... annoying but I can let that slide.   But after ordering we waited, and waited, and waited. 45 minutes in the waitress came to apologize. A few minutes later the manager came to apologize. Said the kitchen was behind. Another 15 minutes go by and I complain... more apologies but still no food. No offer of free drinks. Nothing.   After another 10 minutes with no food we get up to leave. Manager sprints out and asks us to wait a few more minutes and he will box our food and give it to us for free. So I wait. Another 5 minutes pass and he finally comes out. He was able to get 2 of our 3 dishes boxed but one was still missing. He gave it to us for free but at this point we had been there for way more than 2 hours and still didn't have all of our food.   There's no way this should be considered acceptable. If you are that backed up, fine, stop seating people so you can catch up. Offer free drinks or free future meals. Make some effort. We were calm, we were polite, and we were understanding for the most part. But no place is good enough to warrant a wait and poor service like this.   I can't imagine I will ever go back. Shame. The food is good. But the place is poorly run.",

Staff was was very friendly and accommodating. We got the complementary biscuits and in house made blueberry jam. The biscuit itself was delicious the blueberry jam was not our favorite but we are partial to strawberry.  We ordered the chicken and biscuits with an egg, the Shoo Mercy Pancakes and the southern breakfast bowl. The white gravy and biscuits had a great flavor with the basil. The fried chicken was over cooked making it dry and tough to chew. The chicken on my dads pancakes was the same and he did not eat but two bites of chicken. The massive sweet potato pancake was bursting with sweet sugary flavor. I would highly recommend the pancake with the side of bacon combo. My girlfriend's southern bowl was mediocre with eggs, black eye peas, bacon, grits and salsa verde with chorizo added to it. The bowl itself was watery maybe from thin grits and the salsa and the flavor seemed to be lacking. To be completely honest i generally like a more traditional breakfast style with meat eggs and a carb. It is fast easy to make and cheap with good flavor and Tupelo really was none of those for us.",

Didn't care for the lemon one, it was way too tart, but our server offered to replace it.  The biscuits are really excellent. The fried chicken was absolutely AMAZING and the gravy that came with it was awesome !  I got the NC trout, which was good but I didn't care for the dry breadcrumbs in the middle.  One person got the blackened catfish which was probably the healthiest option, but nothing special.  The brussel sprouts were fabulous.  Didn't care for the potato cracklings. We got the Smores chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was really good but would have been better with white chocolate sauce instead of chocolate on chocolate.  For Xmas, peppermint in the white chocolate would be really good !  We'll definately be back.",

The food is so \"sublimely good!\" The bacon is so mouth-watering!  The brunch menu is perfect.  Having Jack Sparrow floating around is a plus!!!!",

Dishes are a nice expansion on Southern food with great pancakes, biscuits, meat and specialty dishes.  Haven't had a bad meal here ever.  Great location and ambiance.   The only drawback is the place is constantly slam packed.  We've had to walk across to another restaurant several times when told by the hostess, without a cringe, that it would be an hour or more for two.  (I actually had the hostess smirk at me once when I asked how long it would be!)  So go if you have the time to wait, or get there well before the crowd and noon-Blue-Law  limit.  Worth the wait, but maybe snack before you go!",

The A/C was very cold and people were complaining about that and there was no soap in the men's restroom and posted above the sink was a sign stating \"all employees must wash their hands.\" That was a little unsettling. I think, if the management would tighten everything up a bit, this place would be deserving of 4 or 5 stars because as I stated before, the food and options are terrific.",

A gentleman named Lucas answered the phone and when he asked what time we'd be arriving so that he could have a cold bowl of ware ready for the dog. He was the first of the kind and pleasant staff that we encountered there. The restaurant is handicap accessible with an elevator. There is both inside and outside seating   Meg was the waitress assigned to our table. She was excellent in helping us with our choices. She was efficient and pleasant   The food was fresh and tasty   We especially liked the fried green tomatoes and grits and the goat cheese with figs and crostini.  The beet salad with pecans was excellent  This was a pleasant dining experience",

    "text": "I very much so wanted to like Tupelo. I had waited and waited to try it, due to the crazy wait times (and my boyfriend not being the waiting type)... until FINALLY we decided it was TIME.   The wait actually wasn't bad 10 minutes or so for the two of us. I really like the setup and the interior of this restaurant. It's beautiful. Our sever recommended the huge mimosas to us, but neglected to tell us they wouldn't hit our table until 15 minutes after we had ordered them. That aside, she raved about the chicken blt and sold us both on it, so we ordered two one with all and cheese one with fries (mine minus the mustard). She also recommended it spicy for something different ( I love spicy so I let her sell me on that too).   They bring out biscuits with jam and honey which we're phenomenal and filling while we waited for our drinks.   When the mimosas finally appeared I was not impressed. They boast an extra 2oz of champagne but mine tasted like straight orange juice so it was definitely not worth the $10 price tag.   Our food came out fairly quickly given how busy they were. The presentation looked nice. But they neglected to leave the mustard off of mine, and its flavor completely overshadowed any of the spiciness that was promised. The chicken itself was good. Not completely tender, slightly overcooked, but decent. Mac and cheese was flavorless, the fries were good, but there were only about 15 of them on my plate.  Our server didn't check back on us until our food was gone hence me never mentioning the mustard. She was pretty lifeless.   I don't know, they definitely didn't live up to the hype. And with a $53 price tag for two... I left hungry and disappointed - the value and output are definitely not worth it.",

    "text": "My fiance and I did our Engagement Brunch here on October 1st 2016. We had a small party with immediate family with 17. Alicia and Jameson were our servers and they were absolutely perfect! They were upbeat, considerate, and were on top of everything from the time we sat down to the moment we were out the door. The conversations with them were so enjoyable and they genuinely wanted us to have a good experience. I can't speak highly enough of them, or of the Guest relations manager! She was also more than I could have asked for.  This review gets 5 stars because of the 3 of them and the amazing kitchen staff who got our food out super quick.  See- this could have EASILY been a 1 star review. I made my reservations well over a month in advance for 10:45 am. I put 11am on the invitations, because I've worked in the service industry and I was expecting a small delay.  We arrived at 10:20, or 7 of us did, and went ahead and let them know we were there. Over an hour later, at 11:25am, 40 minutes after my reso time, after 3 conversations with management, my party, who included a 14 year old with physical disabilities, was finally seated. Oh, and the conversation with the male general manager on staff was appalling. Essentially, they kept telling us the issue was that a couple at 1 of our 4 tables closed out and continued to sit... and sit.. and sit. I don't know about anywhere else, but the 3 restaurants I've worked at that accepted reservations always had ways around these issues, such as setting the expectations when the tables are sat that a reso is set for a later time, or, not seating that section at least an hour prior, if not longer. If you can't make large reservations work, don't take them. However, all the GM wanted to do, was whine to me about how he had to offer the couple a free brunch on their next visit to get them to finally leave- in my opinion, he could have handled that couple and myself much better. His attitude was something that could potentially prevent my fiance and I from returning, and we truly loved our brunches there (this why we chose it for such an important event). All in all, once the guest relations manager and servers came in, all was well. We were on a time crunch after being sat so late, so our food came very quickly and appetizers were sent out free of charge as soon as we sat. Without them, our engagement Brunch, and first family gathering would have been a disaster.",

    "text": "First time here - this location was chosen by a friend who arranged the get-together of a party of eight of us. She had initially called to see whether she could make reservations for Saturday brunch and was told that they didn't arrange reservations for that time of the day. I was the first person to arrive to a very busy, very crowded hostess station, and I was told that we could expect a one-hour wait. Big party, I get that. We had cocktails while we waited - bar staff were on top of their game: We walked up to the corner of the bar, immediately had our orders taken and drinks in hand within just a few minutes. Finally seated after about an hour and a half (big party, limited seating, we get it). Jonathan was our amazing server, and really, if he is available, you'd be wise to request him because he's the best! Charming, knowledgeable, and he did a great job of seeing to our needs without being omnipresent.  New menu for those who had been there before, but I was new anyway, and I liked the menu - a lot. The fried green tomatoes were perfectly prepared - warm, succulent, not soggy, with a crisp coating that had a spicy kick. The chicken and biscuits were enjoyed by a couple of our table mates - you can order it regular or spicy, and with or without eggs. The Appalachian breakfast plate was practically licked by one guy. The French toast with pork belly was also cleaned by another guy at the table. My husband devoured a folded omelet with bacon, fried green tomato, and a stack of other deliciousness in the middle. I had the grit cake with salmon - it was a massive entree and I couldn't finish it, but the flavors were beautifully balanced and I would order it again and again. I also had a lavender-infused lime drink (NA, as I was a DD) that was delicious.   If you go: 1. Be patient, it's worth it. 2. Ask for Jonathan. 3. Enjoy!",

I had been to the location in Asheville, and was quite excited when I heard about one opening in Charlotte. For my first visit, I started with the biscuits and I was already in heaven; warm, soft, flaky, delicious. Some of the other foods I tasted included the pulled pork spring rolls, the fried chicken, the seared scallops and last but not the least, the pecan pie. my favorite of them all was definitely the fried chicken. It's probably amongst the best fried chicken I've ever had. The batter was so flavorful. The chicken was topped with some melted cheese and came with a cauliflower gratin on the side. Moving on from the food...The ambiance was nice & cozy, and the servers seemed very friendly! I'm going back there soon when I'm ready for another divinely semi-unhealthy meal ;)",

The decor is very Southern with lots of yellow and a the rustic frames and doors.   While we waited we had wonderful free biscuits with honey and jam thy were fabulous. I ordered the garlic chicken which was very tasted and came with a side of Mac and cheese and veggies. The Mac and cheese wasn't the best I've had, but was perfectly fine. Friends got the BBQ plate, which was tasty but needed more sauce. The fried okra was delicious! Overall the food was good and I would return.  The only real downer was that our server was not very attentive and we had to wait quite sometime to get her attention. I think it may have been a bad server as many others seemed quite attentive.",

    "text": "We came in during Saturday brunch. We didn't have a long wait, about 20 minutes, during which my boyfriend got the Bloody Mary which was spicy and delicious. We sat outside on the patio with great weather and enjoyed our drinks, his Bloody Mary and my Sparkling Blueberry Punch. We ordered the okra as an appetizer that came with a white BBQ sauce that was delicious and tangy. We ordered our entrees, he ordered the Pimento and Fried Pickle burger and I ordered the Crab Benedict. Our entrees came out and I was immediately surprised thinking that there would be a fair amount of Crab with mine and there was about a tablespoon scattered throughout the hollandaise sauce. The eggs, which should be poached with a runny yolk had runny whites and a fully cooked yolk. I talked to the waitress and she had them recook the plate. When the second plate came out, the Benedict looked a little better but when I cut into the yolk, it was again cooked all the way through. So I didn't want to complain again, I tried to eat the rest of my plate. The Crab and the hollandaise sauce were good, nothing spectacular. It also comes with potato cracklins which in my case was a roughly chopped potato and ended up being an entire half of potato that was not cooked all the way through. At that point, I gave up. The waitress did not come back to check on the second plate but proceeded to drop the check without saying anything. I tipped 20% because I'm a waitress too and know it was not her fault that the food was wrong. I don't typically write reviews on restaurants, but this was bad enough that it warranted a review as well as a note left on the check. We will not be returning.",

The scratch made kitchen is a plus because you can taste the freshness. The Mac and Cheese is standard; nothing to write home about. Sweet Tea is the way a judge a restaurant that claims Southern heritage. Well the sweet tea is on point; taste like its sweetened with cane sugar and honey; a great beverage with a lil lemon sprinkle. Last but not least the biscuits. Soft through and through served with honey and homemade blueberry jam; excellent. My review would have been a 5 if the Mac and cheese was good. A great little place to enjoy an evening.",

    "text": "Finally made it here to get some brunch.  I've been in a Flying Biscuit rut and needed to try these biscuits.   I entered and said party of 1 and they shooed me to the bar.  The place was empty and I like being offered a table.  After I sat down at the bar the hostess came back over and said I could pick a table in the bar area, I didn't have to sit at the counter.  Too late.  The counter had a chilled channel in it which was awesome for keeping drinks cool. I go to Flying Biscuit a lot because they don't serve pork and I don't eat pork so I knew I'd have to pay attention to the menu more.  The chicken and biscuits sounded nice, or maybe the vegetarian options of the day.  The chicken and biscuits was covered in milk gravy and I know in many parts of the US biscuits and gravy is served with sausage gravy.  I asked the bartender if the gravy had any sausage or anything and he said no.  I didn't get the full ingredient list so maybe it has lard or bacon drippings, but definitely didn't taste like bacon so I'll believe it was pork-free.  I was served a biscuit with the jelly and of course honey.  I skipped the honey but used the jelly.  The biscuit is a completely different type than a Flying biscuit.  It reminded me more of a KFC biscuit, but fresher.  I devoured it.  When my meal came it was delicious and exactly what I expected.  breaded and fried chicken breast in a heart shape served over 2 biscuits with white gravy. It was too much after already eating another biscuit.  The bar had many taps including all the local players as well as microbrews.  I was working when I ate there so I didn't get to try a bloody mary, but hopefully I will make it back soon to try it out.  I know I mentioned Flying Biscuit a lot.  Really the two are quite different aside from the fact that both restaurants consider a biscuit to be their signature.",

Complimentary biscuits aided our decision for a main course, and they were phenomenal. For dinner, she got a vegetable plate, allowing for a variety of items which included delicious sweet potato fries and mac and cheese, and I got the fried chicken BLT with my own side of mac and cheese. All of it was fantastic, and I cannot wait to go back to try everything else.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, right in the middle of South End. The staff is super friendly and prompt. We started with the fried green tomatoes...tomatoes were cut too thick and could have been ripened a little bit more - they were very sour/bitter. The sauce they paired with it wasn't my favorite, I think it had basil in it - overall I was very disappointed in that dish. The biscuits were delicious (little thick/dense) but I wasn't a fan of the jam. Overall not the best experience, but I have heard such good things from friends I think it just wasn't my day. I'll definitely try again and just order different food.",

My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, although it was over cooked (ordered medium, came out medium well plus). My Hog Heaven sandwich was good, although not what I was expecting. It did not come with the BBQ sauce as listed on the menu, but Heather quickly brought me some when I mentioned it. The Mac and cheese and goat cheese grits were delicious!! We were stuffed after lunch but still wanted dessert so we ordered lemon custard to go for later. It was great! Tupelo is somewhat pricey, but we'll be back for another special occasion!",

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is beautiful, however, and the service was excellent. I'll definitely go back and try another dish.",

The menu is full of southern favorites with a modern twist. For instance, they serve goat cheese grits. I am not, I repeat NOT a fan of goat cheese, so I asked our server if we can order plain grits. She advised that  the goat cheese tang is really subtle and promptly brought us a sample. She was right!  Imagine me the goat cheese hater ordering them!  They were creamy and cheesy, and very well seasoned.  The kid ordered the French toast. It was thick slices of fluffy challa bread, lightly dusted with confectioners sugar. So good!  The peppered bacon on the side was done perfectly. I ordered the southern poutine scramble - eggs, bacon and potatoes with gravy on top. Very yummy!  Hubby had the sweet potato pancake, which comes with fried chicken on top. The chicken was a little dry, but fried well. The pancake was sweet - almost pumpkin tasting, which was wonderful.   You get a LOT of food for the price. Be prepared for a nap.  We'd definitely return when in the area again.",

    "text": "Not sure why I go to this place.  Sunday brunch is always insanely packed. As this is their busiest service, you think they would be better prepared and have more staff.   We came for Sunday brunch and waited at least half an hour just to get a drink at the bar. I really feel like they should have one bartender dedicated to those around the bar because everyone waiting for a table is trying to get a drink.   We put our name in for a table, but about 45 minutes in we found seating in the bar area.   We quickly put in our food order and more drink orders. Several times our drink orders were forgotten and we had to continue to let the waitress know we hadn't gotten our drinks. Even worse, by this point the crowd had cleared, so we couldn't figure out why service was still so slow.   AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER....we let our waitress know we still hadn't received her food. We told her it had been over an hour and she was surprised by this! It was like she had no idea. She went to talk to the kitchen and food came out soon after.   After all of that, my food was COLD. The manager came over and tried to tell me that the crab Benedict was a \"cold crab salad.\" I let her know my eggs and biscuit were cold as well and she continued to try and tell me that the dish was served cold because of the crab salad. Cold eggs and a cold biscuit?! Gross. I ate two bites and left my plate.   I believe the manager eventually handled the situation well, but she wouldn't drop the fact that it was supposed to have been a cold dish. A bit frustrating.   There are too many good places to eat for this place to be relevant. Such an overrated chain. Too long of a wait for mediocre food. And once the crowd clears, service still seems slow.",

    "text": "For the prices and the cuisine's potential, I should be able to give TH 4 to 5 stars, but instead I'm giving a 2.5. We've been to TH 2x now, once for dinner and once for brunch and both times they've missed the mark.   First off I'd like to say that the ambiance is charming and the waitstaff are generally friendly. It is absolutely a comfortable place to dine. Conceptually, TH is right up our alley; creative dishes, locally sourced ingredients...a nice twist on low country cuisine. They use fresh ingredients of good quality. However, someone in the kitchen is not consistently executing the recipes well at all.  Some items are reliably good, like the buttery biscuits. And sometimes the quality of the paired ingredients makes up for the fact that they're paired in a heavy handed way but a chef of questionable skill level, but only sometimes.  At our dinner, we had a fish entree that was fantastic in terms of freshness of the meat (tasted clean, pleasing...not fishy) but we had to send our salad back as the greens were actually dripping (and wilted by) an obscene amount of really strong sour tasting dressing. It was odd, as if a 5 year old had dressed our salad.  Our other entree and sides were memorable only for their saltiness. The small plates were good.  For our brunch, we had a couple nice appetizers/small plates (cinnamon bun - again, TH seems to do better with baked goods) and a couple disappointing entrees. The giant grit caked topped with salmon was good (ingredient-wise) but there were some serious flaws in construction. If you're going to top anything with a large quantity of smoked salmon like that you've got to make sure the salmon is not 50% gristle. The act of having to forcefully yank what appear to be tendons out of the meat in my entree does nothing good for my appetite. There's an art to cutting meat and fish; True chefs know how to cut along the grain and remove less desirable parts (tendons, veins, other connective tissues/fascia, excessive amnts. of fat, and so on). Plus, with that much salmon and grit cake you've got to give more than a teaspoon's worth of sour cream/creme fraiche and a couple slivers of julienned onions. I wasn't thrilled with the fact that I had to request more sour cream and then was charged for it. The recipe was not executed correctly...don't punish the diner :/  Our eggs and pork belly were not good at all...there wasn't much pork (about 6 pieces, each less than 1\" x 1\"). The pork, onion, and potatoes were all fried in the same pan rendering the dish homogeneous in taste and appearance and very oily.   In sum, for the price I'm not in any hurry to go back to TH. I want every single thing I order to be done correctly. I think this place would be great if they hired a new head chef and took a close look at some of the prep cooks/sous chefs. Keep the menu as is. Keep getting the ingredients from the same resources. Just get a new chef - one who can execute these dishes properly.  Until that change occurs, go to TH for their baked goods, small plates, and drinks.",

It had good flavor. The biscuit and gravy was average. The Southern poutine scramble was disappointing because it came out cold. We saw that it was ready to be delivered but because the chicken wasn't, it sat on the counter for like 10 mins. When it was finally delivered it was cold - imagine eating cold French Fries. I'm sure the dish is better but because it was cold we did not enjoy so therefore I have to rate our experience a two star. Server was friendly but food did not meet expectation.",

We chose to dine here because after previewing the menu, it appeared that my cousin would have some vegan options or an opportunity to make certain items vegan friendly but we were wrong. Tried to order the mountain harvest bowl but was informed that they were out of the items to make it  (it was 930am ) & most other items did not fit her dietary needs. She ended up eating morning star farms, soysage, potatoes, & a side salad (they screwed my salad up so I sent it back ). Ellie, our AMAZING server went ABOVE & BEYOND to try to accommodate us. She even asked the manager if she had any options & we were told \"a salad\" was the best vegan option  (My opinion: condescending comment). Anyway, food was basic, service was slow due to brunch rush, yet good, prices were fair & atmosphere was busy but comfortable. I probably wouldn't return though.",

In my books, Tupelo is more of a 3.5 than a 4, but not a 3. Bottom line is they have staff issues. It almost feels to me that they were not properly trained to meet the demand of being the new kid on the block with high expectations. They did a great job of building excitement on Facebook and I think Charlotte residents were hoping for another great brunch spot on Sunday afternoons.   Here are my issues from a customer point of interaction:   Parking - always has and continues to be a challenge at this location. Not much can be done here.   Customer Service - warm greeting when entering... and we were lucky enough to be seated relatively quickly.   Wait Staff - friendly, but a little forgetful with long periods of time between receiving food and receiving service.   Food - Food is good. I expected more in terms of flavor. It wasn't bad and it wasn't great... but not memorable.   I want to love you Tupelo... I want to be a fan, but adjustments have to be made in order for me to become a returning customer and one that recommends you.   I'll be giving you a try in Asheville soon!",

And oh my god, the complimentary biscuits they serve you at the beginning of the meal are amazing!! Along with the homemade blueberry jam and freshly collected, warmed honey, it's irresistible. And leaves you waning just a but more. Sigh, if only it were on the menu.  But the things that are on the menu are also great! Lots of fried okra, goat cheese grits, and fried tomatoes, among other well roasted and flavored vegetables - delightful for vegetarians. Tupelo honey: welcome to the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line.",

The unexpected appetizer and fresh made biscuits before the meal was a plus. I ordered the goat cheese shrimp and grits with the roasted red pepper sauce. This meal had a great balance of goat cheese flavor and the spicy red pepper. Other women in my group ordered different things such as the sweet potato pancakes amongst others and everyone said that the food was good. My only issue was that we had 2 waiters for a large group and we still had to keep asking them for things such as napkins, extra plates, or things that we had already ordered.",

Amazing Bloody Marys, and the Shrimp N Grits will make you want to slap yo Momma! Really - one of the most delicious meals in Charlotte, and the team has such great personality it makes it a fun environment.   The only thing it needs is more scale. There was a good 1 hour wait at 11am on a Saturday. But that just gave us an excuse to sit on the balcony and enjoy a cocktail from the bar!",

I very quickly consumed the biscuits and blueberry jam so all I can say is they were delicious to the last bite.   The server's recommendations were right on point: jumbo shrimp with cherry peppers, and the curried chicken thigh. The quality was good and the food was bursting with flavor.   I also got the pecan crusted goat cheese appetizer on the house! Let me tell you, I still think about that appetizer- you can't fit wrong with figs, pears and pecans- yum.

No. The poor waitress was in the weeds before be got there, running her self ragged. Drinks took over 30 minutes, we never got biscuits. Then, they are out of half the food we ordered. This was a really bad experience. We asked for a manager, no one came over. 30 minutes later, we ask again. Finally a young guy comes over- doesn't apologize to anyone but says apps (only 2 were ordered) and desserts are on him. Why would we order more food when it took an insane amount of time for anything?! The restaurant was not full and they were not on a wait. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT chose this place for a group larger than say 4 people. It was ridiculous.. it will be hard to convince me to come back.",

What makes it qualify as crab cake is the tiniest sprinkle of what I am sure is canned crab (or possibly imitation crab) onto the top of the egg. Hollandaise sauce has no flavor, just yellow tinged mayonnaise. I've included a picture. My boyfriend was unimpressed with his omelette. The best part were the biscuits that were just....okay. I guess since they are a chain people just come there for that reason and they don't feel like they need to do well when it comes to the appearance and taste of their food. I expected great food and I expected to see the atmosphere as shown in the pictures. The place is cute but they do not serve your food on nice plates. Your food will be plated on an ugly yellow cafeteria looking plate. Maybe I'm just spoiled with all the truly amazing food options Charlotte has to offer. Tupelo honey is another Olive Garden, Chili's and Red Lobster. And those might be better. If you want amazing food and a nice atmosphere, try Fahrenheit or The Village Tavern, Dressler's. The last two mentioned have amazing food and all three have very nice outdoor seating areas. You won't be disappointed like you will be here. I've included a picture of my egg Benedict....I mean \"crab\" cake Benedict.",

Environment: went for Sat brunch on a sunny day, and everyone, from the staff to the families and groups of friends, were happy. The space is airy and light, with tall windows and high ceilings.

    "text": "I had been to the location in Ashville and loved it, so I had high hopes, but dinner here was completely disappointing.   First, our server was indifferent and inattentive. She walked off while my brother in law was mid sentence twice. My father in law asked for iced tea, she came back with a glass of ice and we didn't see her again for 10 minutes. Someone else brought our food by, and it was at least 10-15 minutes before she came to check on is.   We started with an order of the \"Southern Popcorn\" (fried okra) & it was good. Too many little crumbly pieces of just fried dough, and not very many good pieces of okra, but the pieces we had were good.   The biscuits and blueberry jam were delicious. The biscuits were super moist, and I could have eaten about 10 of these.  I had the shrimp & grits (shoo mercy style) and while the shrimp mixture was delicious, the grits were pretty bad. They were advertised as goat cheese grits and had zero flavor. They also weren't creamy at all and were just a congealed mass of flavorlessness.  Graham had the catfish and had the same issue with his grits: congealed with zero flavor. The salsa on top was also kind of odd. The catfish was spicy, so maybe it was supposed to calm it down, but it just didn't work well with it. A salsa with more flavor would have been much better.  We had a party of 8, and no one LOVED their dinner. However, the restaurant redeemed itself after the fact. I made a comment on twitter that dinner was disappointing and the GM reached out to me to make things right. While it doesn't change the fact that our dinner sucked, I appreciate the gesture and will give them another chance.",

(I wish they would offer a smaller portion as a $4 side option vs. the $8 appetizer portion).  There's a nice selection of Carolina draft beers and unique cocktails.  The indoor area is vibrant and cheerful.  The outdoor balcony seating is quieter, lovely and at the far end you can get a peak through the trees of the view of downtown Charlotte.",

The waitstaff was very attentive to our party of 10 (8 adults and 2 two-year-olds).  You would think that on Easter Sunday afternoon, there would be a long wait for our food or the plating would show signs of being hurriedly prepared.  Quite the opposite!  Everything was on point and everyone was very friendly and eager to assist.  I know they all must have been tired from a busy busy day already, but you wouldn't know it.   I have eaten in the Tupelo Honey Cafe in Asheville as well.  Each restaurant has it's own look and feel.  Plus, you won't find any better take on Mama's home cooking anywhere.  Until next time!",

    "text": "Such a disappointment from a place I once really liked.  I remember when Tupelo Honey first opened, and the wait was two hours for a table.  Sadly, I don't think that's the case any longer.  We went for a birthday dinner - reservations for a large party at 7:00 - and were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly and funny, but clearly overworked by having to serve our large party, as well as other nearby tables (perhaps they were short-staffed this particular night??).  That being said, the service was abysmally slow - from drink orders to hot biscuits to the actual dinner to bringing our checks.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but it was clear that the kitchen was slammed - and the managers I observed were spending more time chastising their staff than being helpful (and this was in very plain sight).  My food (burger) was quite good, but I heard several comments from others that their food was just okay.  One guest ordered the roasted beet salad, which, when it arrived, had only about three tiny pieces of  beet in and zero goat cheese.  He very quietly and calmly requested the server take it back and send out the salad as described on the menu.  He got his new salad all right, but he also got a manager with what I perceived as an attitude - questioning him about why he sent it back in a very antagonistic tone.  Not well played, Tupelo Honey, not well played.  We arrived at 7:00 and left at 9:30 - not because we were having so much fun (although we were) but because the service was so very slow - the wait to get our checks and, once we had them, the wait to have them picked up and returned for signatures, was totally ridiculous.   I think I will only return to Tupelo Honey if someone I particularly care for insists that no other place will do - and, even then, I will try to change their minds!",

The service was average at best (we sat in the bar, which was nearly empty) and the hostess was not friendly. She brought us into the bar and sat us at a table that needed to be wiped down. When we asked if someone could do so she seemed appalled we ask for such a thing to be done. Not the normal service their other locations pride themselves on.   Meanwhile, my food was pretty good. I had the BBQ pork, which was downed in sauce, The black eyed peas were awesome, but the mashed sweet potatoes were average. They looked like they came out of a ice cream scooper, much different than what I had at the other locations. My cousin had the shrimp and grits. They were presented well, but tasted average, she said.   Still I believe Tupelo is a great place for lunch or dinner. And, I'm guessing had we sat in the dining area we would have gained a different experience. Hopefully, you will.",

My two sides had fancy names but what came out were fried hunks of potatoes and tasteless Mac and cheese. The only thing that was interesting was the fried tomatoes served on a bed of grits as an appetizer. Moreover these everyday foods were sold for premium pricing. The service was lacsidasical. It took us an hour and a half to eat and leave, when we could have been done in an hour. Overall I don't see myself coming back and I just don't understand the intrigue.

    "text": "Am I happy.  After visiting Tupelo Honey in Ashville, NC we were surprised and delighted to find that they opened a location in Charlotte, so when I came in from a flight we hit for dinner.  Oddish location as it is upstairs in a cul-de-sac of shops off of South Blvd.  If you are not going slow you will blast right by it, so pay attention.  Beautiful interior, especially as contrasted to the dark enclosed Ashville location.  There is a lot of space inside with bar and dining areas and a huge patio which will be wonderful in warmer weather.  Menu is excellent.  My standard is if I see three or more items that I want to eat then the menu is way above average.  And the concoctions which comprise the meals or offerings are unique and clever.  Difficulty in deciding makes the visit an adventure.  Fresh, soft and not falling apart biscuits are served with honey and yummy home-made, I think, jam.  Service is on the spot.  Beverages are refilled without asking.  Servers keep checking on you and I think that it reinforces their personal opinion that Tupelo is a great place, continually confirmed by customers.  A little on the expensive side, but I grant them that as the portions are generous and as mentioned, the concoctions are creative and come together nicely.  Am giving this a three stars, yet keep wavering back and forth as I type between three and four.  It is a solid, even high three, but on one visit am I a fan?  Reading the other reviews the opinions are well below four with service and seating problems, which we did not have.  So lacking a high three or three plus, just give Tupelo a three star rating and let's see how they shake out.  Certainly do recommend you try it and try to come at other than prime time.",

Went there Sunday morning around lunch time and only had to wait roughly 25 minutes which is not bad for Charlotte for the time being. Once we sat down we were attended immediately and had our drinks and complimentary biscuit and blueberry preserves which are a little to hyped up by the other reviews I read prior to coming to the establishment because the blue berry preserves weren't really flavor able but the biscuit itself was soft and tasty. Ordered the fried green tomatoes which arrived in less than 5 minutes. Tomatoes were incredible since they say the on top of some goat cheese grits that had a mild sauce on it. I ordered the fried chicken and pancakes which was a first for me since I've only ever heard of chicken and waffle. I had substituted the bacon for sausage since I don't like bacon( I know I'm Un-American) which was layered on top of the pancake and on top of the sausage was that soft but crispy fried chicken. Too top it off all of these was covered with pecans which I thought was odd at first then realizing that I lack pecans in my regular breakfast entrees. The pancake itself tasted as if a Caucasian teenage female was reincarnated into a pumpkin and put in the pancake batter, not too sweet and not too Starbucks so it was perfect. My date had ordered the fried chicken and biscuits which she wasn't unsatisfied but she had wished that she had ordered one of the omelet a that were floating by the room. It was a lot to eat and we ended up getting to go boxes and a banana pudding to go because that's one of our favorite desserts. The banana pudding was delicious and wasn't to much were it made you fall into an instant food coma but the bananas and wafers tasted fresh even after we put in in the fridge for about 2 hours. In summary staff was excellent and nothing beats comforting southern breakfast so I would definitely go back and try the shrimp and grits.",

    "text": "I had a coworker take me here for lunch the day I flew into Charlotte and ordered the Wicked Chicken Sandwich.  It was very good and the meal came out hot and well prepared.  My coworker had a problem with the biscuits that came at the beginning of the meal.  He was raving about these biscuits and when they came out he ate one bite and said they did not taste right.  When he sent them back to the kitchen, the sous chef came out and explained the dough was not mixed right that morning and she would make us a fresh batch as soon as she could.  We continued on with our meal and when we were finished, the biscuits came out.  They were wrapped up to go.  I have worked in the kitchen of many restaurants in my days and I understand that things do happen.  When they do happen, it is how you handle it that matters and I appreciate the way the Sous chef handled the issue. Kudos to the chef and the staff.  I will revisit this establishment again for sure.  Thanks!",

Complimentary biscuits and jam are amazing (and I don't care for biscuits). We were a party of 6 - three \"good\", and three \"meh\". Hush puppies were very, very salty. My Southern breakfast bowl was lukewarm at best, and just not that appealing. The goal cheese grits were great, though. Likewise for the chopped salad - lackluster, tough chicken, and so-so greens. The bacon (on any dish) is fabulous. Service was slammed, but our waiter apologized and brought us extra biscuits. Very nice craft beer selection. Will try again when it's not so busy.",

That jam is fire! Hard not to fill up on biscuits & jam before your food gets to you. They are a home run for sure, but what is not a home run is The Queen Mary.   Table ordered Queen Mary's for brunch cocktail to ease our suffering from the night before. It came to the table and it was yellow which we all were like \"alright this could be cool, it's got bacon and other stuff in it. Anything with bacon is good, right?\" WRONG. This thing is made with like mustard or something and was super chunky and all three of us took a sip at the same time and got that sour puss face, and spit it out. Swing and a miss!

Service is impeccable, food is amazing and the menu is so diverse it's hard to make a decision!  Last night we went out with some friends for a birthday celebration and we were all so impressed with our server (Tiara, aka \"Brussels\" because she loves the brussel sprouts so much) - she was attentive without hovering, proactive and made great suggestions regarding menu choices.  She was also personable, hilarious and extremely accommodating.  I really can't say enough great things about her, but the awesomeness doesn't stop there...  I had the Venerated Veggie Bowl which was a hard decision for me.  THC has WAY more vegetarian options than most restaurants and they all looked fantastic.  The Venerated Veggie Bowl is super creamy grits topped with black eyed peas, fried okra (loads of it) and the most amazing greens I've ever eaten as well as fresh salsa.  Seriously, those greens were out of bounds good.  Our waitress highly recommended the brussel sprouts but I had no room for another side after the awesome pimento cheese appetizer and those to-die-for biscuits with blueberry jam.  OMG, so good.    My husband had the crab cakes and he said that they were amazing (he considers himself a crab cake aficionado, so take that as huge praise), and my friend had the shrimp and grits, shoo mercy style.  They both couldn't say enough good things about their meals.  I wish we had saved room for dessert or one of the martini specials, but we were STUFFED.  Amazing food, amazing service and a great evening spent with friends.  We will definitely be back to THC, as often as possible.",

The food was absolutely delicious both times and we definitely enjoyed the mimosas and bloody Mary's! (I recommend getting the larger size)  I tried the southern Poutine scramble and loved it! Definitely enjoyed the kale slaw they served with it. Second time around I went with the fried chicken and biscuits with an added fried egg-so filling but soo tasty! The potato Cracklins were definitely a great side although I wish I got to try the Brussels sprouts too.  My fiance got the shoo mercy pancakes with fried chicken and the steak and eggs-he loved both! Oh and can't forget about the great biscuits with blueberry jam and honey! Have to be careful not to fill up on that!  We also visited the Asheville location - not as spacious as the Charlotte location but sitting at the counter meant we got to see just how hard the employees work. The food was still really good here!  We hope to come back to North Carolina soon and stop here again!",

Do yourself a favor and park near the light rail and avoid to parking lot all together.  We had reservations for Sunday morning brunch, but I'm not sure what the purpose of a reservations was, you are still going to wait. We waited about 20 minutes. The host area is very crowded and not alot of seating.   We sat outside and the restaurant is just beautiful. Well decorated and the location is very hip, in the heart of South end.   When your seated they serve biscuits with jelly. They're good, very dense.  I had a mimosa and the wicked chicken biscuit. After placing the order for drinks it took about 5 to 10 min. After placing food order it took 45 min to 1 hour. I believe they hold off delivering your food so you'll buy more drinks. And the food was cold when it was delivered. Poor service in my opinion.  The prices were high. After 1 mimosa, 1 wicked chicken biscuit  (think size of CFA biscuit) tax and tip, I spent $25.00. I feel like I could've had my 3 friends I ate with come to my home for that price and I could have served brunch. Next time I plan on checking out somewhere else. This was the 3rd time I've been here. The first time was great, the 2nd was mediocre and I thought I'd give it another shot. But 2/3 times I wasn't impressed.",

Also, there are very limited gluten free options. I ordered a $14 sandwich with gluten free bread, and the bread was puny and ice cold.  Even the coffee was cold.  Please get better gluten free bread and consider adding one gluten free breakfast option such as gluten free pancakes. Lastly, the service was incredibly slow.

I wanted to substitute the potatoes for grits and they said it was against kitchen regulations. The potatoes were too crunchy for my liking.

    "text": "I hate goat cheese. But Tupelo Honey changes my mind. I was in the mood for vegetables. So I decided on the Famous Fried Green Tomatoes/Fried Okra/Crispy Brussels Sprouts. The Famous Fried Green Tomatoes are served over goat cheese grits and red pepper coulis. I didn't know what coulis was until I Googled it. Coulis is a thick sauce made from pureed and strained vegetables or fruits. The tomatoes was cooked to perfection (golden brown) and the dish was finished with fresh basil. Whoever thought about goat cheese in grits is heaven sent. This place makes me look at goat cheese differently. Probably the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had. The fried okra was great as well. This was served with a with sauce that gave me ranch vibes. The Crispy Brussels Sprout was served with fresh herbs and lemon zest and a tangy ranch. Overall experience was absolutely great. And it seems that have a great HAPPY Hours too.",

    "text": "So good! First of all, my brother made a reservation online the day before. We pulled up exactly at 12:30pm for lunch, and they were calling him letting us know our table was ready. Perfect!  Our waiter was very friendly. He was able to accommodate our group of 6 just fine. A few of us ordered mimosas and bloody Marys. Despite how busy the restaurant was, they came out within a few minutes. Those were delicious! (Though, I could just be saying that because I was dining with my parents and they were causing us to drink!)  A few minutes later, their signature biscuits came out, with the homemade blackberry jam. The jam isn't too tart, and I love how you can still see the little pieces of berry when you got to spread it on your hot, fluffy biscuit.  For my main course, I ordered the fried chicken BLT. The chicken was perfectly fried. Nice and crispy, with juicy white tender meat inside. The bacon was also crispy-a must with a BLT. My side idea was a small salad, which actually wasn't small at all. It was a good bowlful. The salad contained spring greens, carrots, cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts. I ordered the avocado vinaigrette, which was really good. You should definitely come visit Tupelo Honey!",

It was quite an adventure for them as they had never had southern cuisine. We all started out with drinks. I had that cocktail of the day as well as the sangria. Both solid strong drinks. One of the guys had to get their award winning bloody mary. Not only was it visually stunning, it tasted amazing with just the right amount of spice. For appetizers we indulged in the fried green tomatoes, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, & pickles. The batter on the cauliflower was delish and we all decided that we would return just for the brussel sprouts alone. Food euphoria!! Definitely did not disappoint! Quite a few of us had the variations of shrimp and grits and we were all pleased. The best part of our experience was the very welcoming staff. Our waitress went above and beyond to ensure that our visit was memorable. She even went as far as offering to mail me a pint glass because they were out of stock. We were all impressed with our service and they won us over as repeat customers. If you are in the area, you should stop by and give this place a try!!",

One of my favorite items of the night was, surprisingly, my mom's side of potato cracklins. I've had a lot of potatoes in my lifetime, but I've never seen them cooked quite that way before and they were delicious. Would I come again? Probably not, but it's worth trying once.",

I really wish I could have giving this place a better review than last time, but my experience was unfortunately worse.   The food looks amazing but the taste is medicore, especially for the price. Except the biscuits. Those were delicious.   I ordered the shrimp and grits without the chorizo. I had four pieces of shrimp, that tasted a bit too 'fishy'. 2 shrimps in the waitress came over and asked if I wanted a box, so even though I wasnt done eating I felt almost a bit pressured and put the rest to go.   My husband ordered the fried chicken with the mac and cheese and a corn slaw. He did enjoy his chicken, but was not impressed with  the sides. His words were \"KFC does slaw and mac and cheese better\". The \"jalepeno corn slaw' was mostly just a blah cabbage slaw with hints of corn kernels. Dissapointing.   The atmosphere is nice, the waitress made us feel a bit uncomfortable, food was whatever.   Sorry to say, def wont be back.",

If you go, you must get the fried green tomatoes.  They are consistently amazing, even during brunch.  Always well seasoned, hot & crispy.  You should also try the mega mimosas as they are worth the $$!  However, you can pass by the gulf coast lump crab benedict.  Of course the biscuit and the potato cracklings were great.

One thing I frown upon is lack of effort in presentation, especially if the flavor is lacking. According to the recipient of these pancakes, they were entirely too sweet. Yuck.  I'd return to try their drinks, perhaps, but if I never returned I'd be ok, which actually disappoints me.",

I have to say I was very impressed with how great the energy was inside the restaurant considering the busy nature of the brunch bunch. I've been going here quite a bit because every time I do sit down to grab a bite it's always an enjoyable experience. I'm a server and it's rare for me to find that one person who makes me want to come back for more. Even though it was incredibly busy, Alisha KILLED IT. One of the best servers I have had in a while. I knew she was busy but she would take the time to sit with me as if she didn't have any body else to wait on. Ask for her. She's hilarious, heart warming and just a down to earth good person. Made the experience that much better. I usually take more photos of my food and drinks but the food was so good I got distracted and forgot to take any more photos.  So go over and find out for yourself how great this place is. Love it every time.",

All they have to offer is pork and to me that's unacceptable because not everyone (especially nowadays) eats the pig. However, on a positive note, I do always have great service here and the food is pretty good. Now, their Sweet Potato pancakes are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and I don't even eat sweet potatoes so I highly recommend that dish but it's disappointing when I can't eat meat with my pancakes...... so I'm hopeful that going forward they will incorporate that for us non-pork eating individuals. Lastly, I had their tomato soup (really good) but the grilled cheese strips on rye bread did not really pair with the tomato soup... maybe if it was on white bread, it would've been a great match!",

I approach the establishment. EXCITED. The smell of pancakes and honey reeked the parking lot. Which excited me more.   I was greeted by a cute host who sat us. What happened next was appalling.   I ordered drinks and didn't receive it for 40mins. I asked the waitress about it who became defensive because she felt as if I was rushing the bartender. Now, I'm realizing it's a crime to inquire about your order here.   When I'm a paying guest and I deserve to know what's taking so long. So, I can make a more informed decision. I could've believe what i was witnessing.   That sparked poor service for the rest of the meal. I ordered the Shrimp and grits. The waitress would barely come check back with table. By the time my food arrives it was cold. I don't understand cold grits.   Hardly refilled glasses for beverages. Needless to say, i lost my appetite. I couldn't even experience the great food I heard about because of a rotten apple and piss poor attitude. When will employees learn food/drinks will always be a people business. It's so important to be nice and courteous with people. Very disappointed to say the least.",

    "text": "This weekend my husband and I met a work friend for Sunday brunch at Tupelo Honey Cafe. It was a very fine day in the Queen city. After a brief but very cold winter and a few False starts, I felt like finally Spring was happening. The sun was shining, the temperature neared the 60s and the drive was easy.  Tupelo Honey Cafe is located on the second story of a slightly nondescript building. The first thing that I noticed was a crowd waiting for tables to open up on a beautiful porch. The wait I hear can be long but the owners have done a very fine job of making everyone comfortable. Have a seat on the large porch and let the perfect Spring breeze calm you as you wait.  Fortunately, I had reservations (you can make these via the Tupelo Honey Website). We were seated almost immediately. When you walk inside, you will notice the high ceilings and the bright feel of the place. I loved the exposed brick and wood along with an open kitchen. I felt the spacious outside carried over into the inside very well. The place was packed but I never felt crowded and could have a nice conversation with my brunch-mates.  Our waitress was friendly but not overly so and checked on us appropriately throughout our meal. After we ordered, she brought us each a warm buttermilk drop biscuit and a serving of Tupelo Honey's blueberry jam. It was delicious. I thought the jam was perfectly balanced but could have used a tad bit of lemon.  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken BLT sandwich with tomato soup as a side. My husband ordered Fried Chicken and my friend ordered the Shoo Mercy Pancake. We received our food in a fairly quick amount of time considering how packed the dining room seemed to be. My tomato soup was spicy and sweet and well seasoned. My husband is decidedly not a tomato soup fan but enjoyed the few spoonfuls that I shared with him. The chicken sandwich was massive. Perched between two buttered buns, a generous slice of tomato and fresh green lettuce, sat a hand battered fried chicken breast. Also, the bacon was to die for - sweet and smokey. My husband loved his biscuits and gravy and his chicken he said was delicious. My friend seemed to be relishing her massive, fluffy pancake.  We had a wonderful experience at Tupelo Honey Cafe. I am certain that we will go back and try their dinner service sometime soon. Most of the time I roll my eyes when I see buzz words like \"New South Flavors\" but Tupelo Honey Cafe feels sincere in their attempts.",

It was a combination of soy sauce, pineapple juice, and orange juice.  This combined with the maple butter gave it what it was missing.  The fried okra was really good.  I also got Mac and cheese which had a little kick to it.  They stated that it was made from scratch so I was thinking that it would be something baked.

The only thing that I might say is even better than the food was the service that we got from our server, Jonathan. We've recently moved to Charlotte and he was very inviting and helpful not to mention incredibly knowledgable of the menu and friendly. We definitely will be back here.",

NEGATIVES -The food is heavy, all of it.  Even the vegetarian dishes are swimming in sauce or gravy or dressing.  And the food just isn't stellar.

Place was pretty busy and since I didn't have time to wait they offered us the counter right at the kitchen which was open.  Kind of like a Chef's table but they called it something different.  The experience was doubly awesome since we got to watch them prepare all of the yummy dishes.  We were right there facing the line cooks and chefs.  Both me and my co diner ordered the nutty fried chicken on the recommendation of the server.  It was served with sweet potato mash and asparagus.  The entire plate was quickly devoured and I must say it was very tasty.  Oh, and they started us off with one of the most wonderful, fluffy rolls that I have ever eaten.  Since I was right there I noticed a sign that said that the rolls, before being served had to be approved by a chef before going out.  Pretty cool, and maybe that contributes to the hot, doughy perfection that I ate.  All in all, it was a great experience at a renovated old favorite restaurant of mine.  I will definitely return so I can try other things on a menu that I really didn't have time to properly peruse but remember there was some pretty great stuff on it.",

Benn here for brunch and dinner at various times and can honestly say I've had a great time whenever I've been here. The bloody mary's for brunch are simply awesome...spice or not, depending on taste but always with a little okra to add a little southern flavor. The portions have always been good and food good tasting...from the chicken on down to everything else. The biscuits and honey they give you before dinner are also excellent, one of the better Southern touches the restaurant specializes in. I've tried many things and have never had a bad meal. Service is usually awesome, parking can usually be found with a little searching their backlot but it's best to plan for a little wait time at brunch and dinner because sometimes the line can be long.

I ordered the Appalachian Bounty Scramble which contains all-natural pasture-raised Hickory Nut Gap Farm sausage, blueberries, arugula, kale and Havarti cheese.  It also comes with a side of toast and carrot and kale slaw. It was delicious! I devoured the entire plate in addition to the biscuit and homemade jam that is served at the beginning of your meal.   I recently brought my parents here, as I was raving about this place. I would be giving this place 4/5 stars, however, the service was sub par.  This time I ordered the Big Honkin' veggie burger with the homemade potato chips and asked for no onion (of course onion came on it). My dad ordered an omelette and my mom ordered the Appalachian Bounty Scramble with the sausage on the side as she does not eat meat, but I was going to eat it. Inside of no sausage it came with DOUBLE sausage, which was incorrectly inputed by our waitress. She haphazardly apologized and took her meal away. Upon bringing her the correct item, she brought her food out piecemeal...one plate with the scramble sans sausage, and then a small plate with a tiny amount of slaw and the grilled toast.  I don't think that the waitress should have taken the item off of the bill but at least offer us free drinks or a dessert. I was extremely disappointed in how she handled the situation.  Hopefully Tupelo will be better next time.",

There is a nice outdoor space, but not a lot of parking, so be aware, you may have to circle around a bit to find a space.   At 11am the place was full. We had a booth in the back near the kitchen. Our waiter took a little bit to come over so by the time he did we had decided on our food. 4 of us decided on the Poutine Scramble, and I got a glass of Brut Champagne which was $7. I'm glad I ordered my drink when I did because the next time we saw our waiter was when we got our food. He brought out the complimentary biscuits with our meal. The timing felt a little off and I think I would have enjoyed more of my biscuit if it came before the meal.  The scramble was a lot of flavors. It comes with eggs, potatoes, cheese, white gravy, bacon (I think because it might be bacon bits), etc. It's a lot. I just think I didn't get gravy on eggs. I was hoping it would work, but it didn't.   The waiter did refill our glasses 3x which was great because as my husband so lovingly says, I drink water like a camel. I just feel like he was really overwhelmed.   Based on the reviews of the Asheville location I had high expectations going in, maybe the bar was set a little too high.",

    "text": "Our family visited Charlotte and we ate dinner at Tupelo Honey Cafe for my sister's Law School Graduation. The restaurant is located on the second floor (which you can take the stairs or elevator), and it is also located across the street from the Fire Station which is very odd.  The server was kinda in a pissed off mood (and a I don't care attitude) towards the beginning, but once during he wrote down our orders his mood changed.  I ordered a \"Mountain Pulled Pork Sandwich\" but oddly enough I got a \"Bone-In Porterhouse Pork Chop\" instead.. too many pork items on the menu maybe? He said that he would change it for me once I brought him about this issue, but I wasn't that picky so I sticked with it and ate it. The Pork Chop was great and juicy, but I kinda wished I ate the Mountain Pulled Pork Sandwich.  The restaurant overall is great, and when it comes to ownership. I think both the owner and manager roaming the restaurant helping tables are both great and friendly.  Note: Tupelo Honey Cafe gets really cold. So be prepared to bring a sweater or a jacket with you when you enter.",

The biscuits are wonderful, and the Appalachian egg rolls are a must have appetizer! My favorite dinner entree is the \"Shoo Mercy\" Pancake -  Our famous sweet potato pancake with whipped peach butter, spiced pecans, buttermilk fried chicken, maple peppered bacon and 100% maple syrup.  Seriously, amazing food!",

    "text": "Let me first say that Tupelo is one of my favorite places however, this location did not compare to their Asheville store. It's hard when a restaurant expands with various locations. Our server Iris was A-Mazing! Kudos to her!!! She was so friendly and spot on! She knew her products well and had such a chipper attitude. She was from Ohio but struck me as a Georgia Peach! We really enjoyed her company! She brought extra sauces and napkins without us asking. We orders what we normally order at the Asheville store....pimento cheese dip, wings and fried green tomatoes. We wanted to order potato cracklins but they said it would take an hour (since they just opened) so we ordered chips which we're just ok. Right after our food hit the table here comes Iris with an order of cracklins on the house. They were done sooner than they thought and boy were they good. Smashed potatoes deep fried...oh man! So, the wings were good but not as good as we remember from previous visits also the pimento cheese dip taste like it had grain mustard in it which I don't remember. It was a strong taste that we both didn't prefer. The tomatoes were good but needed salt also the grit bed needed more flavor. The ranch had a garlic hint to it and wasn't great but the blue cheese was chunky and on point.  I forgot to mention my Bloody Mary- they make their own mix and it is so good! The pepper rim is to die for. So all in all it was a $48 lunch and felt more like it should have been $20. I feel a bit jipped to be honest. Not what I know Tupelo to be!",

One of the entrees came out wrong, was brought back out with the wrong side (a side that neither of us would ever eat or order at any restaurant,  in fact we loathe it so we were certain we hadn't ordered it), but it was quickly remedied. We weren't mad about this, it happens.  Drinks were delicious but the mule we ordered was charged at full price instead of happy hour price... hence the 3 stars. At this point I had already paid and didn't want to point out any more faults, so we just left. But please, for the sake of offering happy our specials (especially in NC where drink specials legally have to be offered all day), make sure they ring in correctly.",

    "text": "Just moved to Charlotte, my in laws are coming in town to visit next weekend, so my husband and I wanted to scout a few places out. Despite the rave reviews we were terribly disappointed with the service. In fact the WORST server we have ever encountered in a long time.   10 minutes after seated the server finally came ask for drink orders. A moment later someone else came back with water, then another 5 minutes later she came and asked if we were ready to order, I promptly told her we were still waiting on the coffee. She then said\" oh so he didn't bring the coffee out? Alright guess I will get it now.\" WHAT? Red flag #1.   Coffee came out and tasted like it had been sitting there for two days. Since our server once again disappeared, we told the bus boy who dropped off the food to please get her for us. So we told her coffee tasted bad only for her to come back and said that's what it's suppose to taste like, in a way like we were lying and she's doing me a favor to take it off the bill. It's as if I didn't drink coffee almost everyday for the past 15 years and I know what coffee should taste like and it's definitely not sour. Red flag #2.  Oh and the famous biscuits. Toward the end of the meal she asked if we wanted biscuits. Sure. Although isn't it suppose to be brought out at the beginning? Moment later she said biscuits are being made and if we still want them. Yes sure. After meal is finished she came back AGAIN and said no biscuits. Still baking. At this point we have no words.  Red flag #3.   Hey on a side note, food was good. Big portions. We needed couple boxes for the leftovers. So instead of giving us proper size boxes she grabbed 6 little containers, said they are out of big boxes out in the balcony area (meaning she didn't want to waste her time to walk back inside). It just gets better. She dropped off the check, my husband pulled out the wallet getting ready to pay on the spot as we didn't want to wait another who know how long before she appears again. Then she had the guts to say \"yeah it's better you give me the card now, they are transitioning me inside so once I go back in it will be awhile\". JUST WOW.   I'm a generous tipper and never go under 20%, my husband tipped $4 on $30 for this horrible experience. I would've tipped her nothing at all.   We will never come back and that waitress needs to be fired.",

    "text": "I spent my birthday in a lousy environment with poor service and terrible food. I drove from Jacksonville FL to spend my birthday with family and friends in Charlotte/Concord. My best friend went to the honey Tupelo restaurant in Asheville and suggested weeks ago that we should have dinner at this restaurant. Being the foodie I am, I started researching and couldn't wait to dine here.  We arrive at the restaurant on time for our reservation on a Wednesday night @615p. The floor was empty, and The hostess looked lost and started pulling tables together for our party of 10. We sat down and was greeted promptly by our server. We ordered or drinks, and waited a full 45 minutes for our first(and only) mixed drinks and even longer to begin our food order. Totally unacceptable. We were then informed there was a party of 35 and that our food would be delayed. Begrudgingly we all accepted. We ordered our food.   what came next? Cold Food. One person didn't get their tacos till 20 min after our food was delivered. & We were still missing a kids Mac&chz. We were all starving that we inevitably shared and ate our dishes. But mid meal, our children started fussing that the food tasted bad. As parents this is not uncommon to hear. So we tried a spoonful of the buttered pasta.... sure enough it tasted like dirty dish water, one friend felt there was maybe some chemicals mixed in. It was just overall disgusting.  The other kids dish we ordered was macaroni and cheese. Now, the portion of the macaroni in comparison to the buttered pasta was ridiculous. If I'm being generous it was a square 3inx3in piece on a tea plate. With no sides.  The adult plates, chicken fried steak was compared to a rubber boot. The sides of the flat iron steak, were severely bland Brussels sprouts. Almost as if they were boiled in the hospitals cafeteria and served to you for health not enjoyment.   So I finally get the nerve to complain. I really am understanding. If the place was hopping, you have a serious wait. If the server was in the weeds about to wave her white flag. I'd totally get it. But what I encountered was the extreme opposite. An empty floor, with two parties, a 35 top (that was mid way they their meals when we arrived) and my 10 top.   The manager came over, very apologetic. Discounted our check, removed the kids food, replaced the buttered pasta with grilled cheese. Did everything you should do for a disgruntled customer. He redeemed himself when he presented a free (bland, boring) chocolate cake and a Tupelo honey recipe book.   BUT THEN it went down hill again. Took over 30 minutes to get our check after the dessert came. The bill was incredibly wrong. They triple charged us for one appetizer. They couldn't seem to understand that they needed to take 2 appetizers off since we only ordered one! So that added another 15 min. It was just a complete mess. We didn't leave till 830. Over two hours wasted at a poor quality, poor service, poor dining restaurant.   Save your time and go somewhere else. The biscuits aren't even worth it.",

Megamosa is also sure to turn your morning around. Cucumber drink is refreshing, not sweet at all.  Appetizers: Jalapeno Pork Egg Rolls...we LOVED these.

Our waitress, Lex, was great...friendly and fun, but when we were approaching 50 minutes from when we ordered our lunch we gave her (the kitchen) just 5 more minutes before we would leave. Our lunch arrived within that window.  Food was okay - not terrible but not great, or even very good.  Just okay.  A $44.00 lunch bill - no value given what we got this day.  There are so many choices in Charlotte now, doubt we'll come back as everything is a little worn... there are so many other places where food and service are still the star. Would not recommend.",

The pancakes come with one piece of fried chicken, apple cider bacon, two eggs. It is a pretty big portion for one person. (Maybe that's why it is a bit pricier than other dishes) We shared and ordered one appetizer. The buttermilk chicken was very crispy! The sweet potato pancake is good not not a wow taste to me. Grits that came with fried green tomatoes was good and sauce on the top added great flavor on it. Our server was very nice and the food was good.",

Honestly, the previous experience was great so I was excited that they had a location around where I lived.   What rubbed me the wrong way was the food. It took a very long time to come out and when it did, it looked like it was sitting under the heating lamp a bit too long. I got the pimento burger (which was probably my mistake) and the flavors were really flat. It just tasted like a greasy hamburger with a side of regular Mac and cheese. I expected more for the price and from my previous experience.   I will say the situation was remedied by an extremely nice and courteous waiter. It was an anniversary dinner and she really tired her best to make the night special. She was always on hand and super nice. If it wasn't for her, the entire experience would have been laughable.   Overall, the ambiance was nice and the service was great. The food was what really put a damper on the night. The waiter was nice enough to not charge for my food and gave me this cute cook book so it wasn't all bad. I would take caution when choosing this place for special occasions.",

    "text": "Taking the Lynx to downtown Charlotte, I spotted the yellow sign at the East/West Blvd Station through the trees. While Van Morrison's song title got me in the door for lunch, I didn't expect anything other than standard Southern fried fare. This standard often translates into too much of everything: too much butter, too much grease, heaping portions. For an expat Southerner now living on the West Coast, this oversizing isn't necessarily a good thing.   Surprise! This place got it right.   I was served a bit buttery biscuit as an appetizer that came with blackberry jam and tupelo honey, but I could actually taste the fruit instead of just sugary jelly. I opted for the veggie plate. The black eyed peas had a nice kick and weren't just boiled bland mush, the brussels sprouts were tender, and the highlight--the fried okra was lightly breaded, allowing the full taste to come through. This is how veggies should be prepared and Tupelo Honey Cafe proves not just my Grandma can do it!   They even have a Gluten Free Menu.   Forget Paula's place further down, bring your out-of-town guests here!",

    "text": "Very disappointing.   Came early Saturday evening, around 5:30, and it was packed.  Wait for a table for 2 was 45 mins. You can't make reservations despite what their (infuriating and confusing) automated answering machine said.  Ok, no problem.  I'm willing to wait for good food and to try a new place.  Luckily, we snagged two seats at the bar within 10 mins.  It was all downhill from here...  Cocktails were awful.  They don't carry Tito's, so I went with a Stoli (up with a twist).  Not good.  The perfect vodka martini should be ice cold with shards of ice crystals and citrus oils.  Mine was cold-ish... and had a thick awkward corkscrew of rind balanced on the rim.  Whatever.  We moved on to the specialty \"cockytails.\"  DIABETES. seriously. we tried the blueberry skinny tea and cool as a cucumber and they both tasted like sugar water.  The one/only good thing was the jalapeno bacon moonshine.  We took shots of that and I would recommend.  Very jalapeno-y and bacon-y and... yah, first time I've had a savory shot and I liked it.  Food was mediocre to awful.  We were about to order the fried okra when the people next to us said it was bad.  My friend tried some of the neighbor's  -- mushy and bland and gross.  Biscuit was undercooked and unimpressive. Appalachian egg rolls were dripping with oil, yet not crispy (I imagine the oil wasn't hot enough), and just meh.  Shrimp and grits were fine... but nothing special.  The fried egg and bacon sandwich with home fries were also fine... but it was no different from what I could have made in 5 mins. on any given weekend morning.  Service was obviously lacking because the place was slammed and we were at the bar.  Let's go with \"N/A\" here.  We opted to skip dessert.  I just don't get how there's so much hype surrounding this place.    TL;DR -- Wait for table is long; cocktails will give you diabetes; food is mediocre.",

A little loud, but it just kinda makes you cheerful to be here.  The food is very good, I'd say 8.5 out of 10. Really great biscuits came out courtesy of the restaurant. Many people ordered the goat cheese grits and had high hopes for them that were disappointed - personally I thought they were great, just depends on how phenomenal they were in your mind. I highly recommend the veggie bowl - very filling, great flavors, and absolutely slime-free fried okra. You really pay for what you get though, prices are on the expensive side.   As for service, which seems to have been an issue for some: My own experience with a very large group (over a dozen) was fairly good. The server was a bit severe about not changing seats so that no orders would get mixed up, but everything came out promptly and for the most part to the right people. Several people had sipped on my rosemary peach lemonade (awesome but not recommended for kids as it is not sweet) by the time someone figured out it was mine and had been brought to the wrong person, but no biggie.",

Unfortunately after having been to this location for a few years now everything is just okay, yes, some things are better than others, but consistency for me is the issue.  Their biscuits are great, and I love their popcorn fried okra, but when it comes to entrees I haven't been able to order the same meal twice and enjoy the same experience. I will say most recently I participated in an evening with New Belgium Brewery.  It was a five course meal, paired with a New Belgium beer.  The experience was amazing, and each dish was outstanding.  I would love if they could deliver what I experienced that night every night.  I love stopping in here for brunch and even dinner, but have hopes that consistency will improve, especially after my most recent experience.",

The complimentary table biscuits were amazing!  I barely find shrimp and grits at restaurants, so when I saw it on the menu, I knew I had to have it.  I have to say I made a great choice and I wasn't disappointed.  If you are looking for great food with a southern flare with great food; stop by Tupelo Honey.  But make sure you have time to wait because again it took a while.",

I got a avocado toast which was drenched in honey sriracha sauce. The sauce took away from everything. The bread was super hard to even remotely cut into. I gave up cutting up my bread and ate the avocado drenched in the nasty sauce. The avocado toast was served with a wilted salad not fresh at all.  Southern hospitality mimosas had a hint of nectar flavor but the mimosas was flat no oomph where did the pinapple flavor go?   My party did not enjoy there meals as well. The omelet had bacon which was not crispy instead it was just fatty and soggy.   The chicken sandwich was mediocre. Apparently the breading ratio was more breading then chicken.  They also did tenderize the chicken which causes to cook unevenly.  I ordered a side of sage sausage. The sausage was not edible. The texture was very mushy and the taste was so horrible I can't describe it baby food taste better then the sage sausage. Right in my napkin it goes.  Please save your money and time go elsewhere. We were fortunate I was a yelp user we got a little bit off. 10% better then nothing.   Our server name Morgan was extremely impersonal and rude. I mean seriously who as a server rolles there eyes at the customers? We got major eye roll when we asked him for a third cup for the free pint giveaway. Our party of three all signed up to receive a free pint glass. Not only did he roll his eyes he slammed the cup onto our table.   The seating was infront of a running food door. Everytime a server needed to run a food for the people on the patio we got a blast of hot air slammed in our faces. I mean blocking a exit sure could be under.  I hope management looks into the seating arrangements. Do better employee training for customer service. Also look into reaching out to cooperate about there menu and there lack of taste.  Happy Fourth of July!",

The burger had a tough time holding together so out came the silverware.   The service was good but the kitchen was a little slow, especially since it was before they got REALLY busy. The rating of four stars is really based on the gap between hype and reality; the meal was good but I expected more especially at the price point.",

We went for lunch on a Sunday, and the place was very busy, which is fine. We had reservations for 12:45, but were seated late, as they were running behind. Our drink orders were taken right away. However, it took about 30 mins for our food orders to be taken. We also had to ask multiple times and from 2 different people for utensils. After we started eating, we noticed we had no napkins, and when we asked the waitress, she said they had run out of napkins, so the manager was looking for more...?? Very strange. The food was also not as good as I expected. The fried pickles were great, but the chicken was unfortunately very dry.  We may give them another shot at some point, but we did not have a good first impression.",

    "text": "We went to Tupelo Honey near the South End of Charlotte with some out-of-town guests who were very excited/determined to go. We went for brunch on a Saturday, and some of our group ordered the Bloody Marys that were presented with a lovely strip of candied bacon, some olives and pickled okra. I had a sip, and joined the consensus with a thumbs-up on the tasty tomato mix.   Our service was excellent. However, I wasn't as thrilled about the fried chicken as I wanted to be. I try to order something that is a 'signature' for a place. The hot sauce on the chick was too hot and 'one note' for me and I didn't enjoy the boring fried coating. In fact, the chicken didn't have much flavor. Or perhaps my taste buds were already 'lasered numb' by the hot sauce. I surveyed the table with order-envy and regretted that I hadn't gone for the sweet tea flavored fried chick instead.   Overall, our group was happy with their food, and enjoyed the flavorful Brussels sprouts, biscuits and honey that we shared among us.  Part of the charm of Tupelo Honey is the 2nd-floor location (old building, wide porch) that sits among the trees. The company could elevate the brand a bit with some attention to things like their menu design and logo. The logo makes no sense and feels so \"off\" when they have a cool name and vibe to work with...what's up with not having professional design? Takes it down towards \"Lizard's Thicket\" to me.  It was odd also that someone came by our table and asked how things were without introducing himself. We wondered...who was that, the manager, or just an obnoxious passer-by?  Overall it was enjoyable. With a little love and attention, Tupelo Honey could warm itself up and get from good to great.",

If I would describe it's like the distant cousin of Jacob's Pickle.   The Brunch menu had the prototypical Southern food. I went all in - i had the fried green tomatoes, pimento cheese and the Shoo Mercy breakfast. All the dishes were creative and well executed but I feel it lacked the flavor profile I was expecting. It was really good but I had some heightened expectations. It's also odd that the best part of the meal was the complimentary biscuit with homemade jam.

There was nothing special about the Brussels sprouts... added honey and even pulled out the lemon pepper from my bag to season it.. still nothing. I ordered an appetizer and never got it, which wasn't a big deal, I told her if they hadn't started it, not to. The entree looked like enough food. I'm not going to hate on the waitress because I've been in her shoes but I do feel like she could have been a little more personable and friendly.   I'm not sure what course is better, but I'm going to say brunch isn't their strong point...? Idk.

It's located on the 2nd floor of a beautiful building located in downtown Charlotte right next to the Blue line.  Park in the back of the building and walk up the stairs to the the 2nd floor.  What a fabulous restaurant!  I love the farm to table decor look about the place.  Wood floors and casual dining tables make this place a very comfortable and cozy place to eat a meal.  We started with Tupelo #brunchsohard Coffee - a signature blend roasted by revelator   What a delicious and smooth cup of coffee, I loved getting free refills on this excellent coffee.  Meals: Old School Breakfast bowl Slow roasted pork grilled cheese  Shoo mercy sweet potato pancakes  My meal was the Shoo mercy sweet potato pancakes - buttermilk fried chicken, apple cider bacon, spiced pecans, 2 fried eggs, grilled seasonal fruit, pickled blueberries.  What an amazing meal!  The chicken was fried perfectly, the meat was tender and juicy.    The sweet potato pancakes, oh my! I've never had anything like it.  They were amazing.  The bacon was delicious, the grilled apple was tasty, but those blueberries were weird.  Thankfully they were not the star of the show. It was like they were soaked in apple cider which made them very tart and tangy.    ** my only negative comment is that my meal didn't come with spiced pecans**  Everything was fantastic!  It was a lot of food but not too much that I couldn't finish it.  The other meals ordered were said to be wonderful as well.  We had an excellent meal and a great time eating here.  I would highly recommend eating here.",

    "text": "Stopped in for brunch on a weekday ( Friyay). Restaurant had a few people inside but not overcrowded. We were immediately seated with our sever who was the sweetest young woman ( unfortunately can't recall her name). The atmosphere: welcoming and pleasant. I started off with a blueberry punch which was sweet and refreshing. we decided to grab few small bites.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese bites along with the honey chipotle wings . The Mac n cheese bites were perfectly fried into medium sized balls of gooey goodness. They came in a flavorful creole gravy . The wings were crispy on the outside , tender, juicy and fully cooked on the inside. Mmmm that chipotle sauce tho...sweet & savory. My favorites though were the complimentary biscuits, warm n fluffy. Best believe I slathered them with blueberry jelly and drizzled honey. So comforting.    Can definitely say overall I enjoyed myself here, can't wait to return and try other the dishes .",

Wife had fried chicken and biscuits with gravy (Brunch all day menu) and it was amazing...biscuits are simply amazing but fried chicken is just wow!! I ordered the hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly, for the side the cackling potatoes were better than any fries or potatoes I've had in a very long time! Good beer selection and our server was super friendly and helpful. Well done guys! I guess anyone can have a bad day..5 stars! (Even though salt shakers still suck :)",

They were cooked and seasoned perfectly and came with an amazing dipping sauce.   The pork sandwich in Rye that I had was very tasty. The bread was perfectly toasty, pork was tender and tangy, which made the whole sandwich come together perfectly. Their baked Mac and cheese was flaky on top but creamy in the middle.   Of the four desserts, the banana pudding and peanut butter were by far the very best!   Great food, great service, and great atmosphere.",

I liked the fresh avocado slices, they really made the dish. My mom got the honey dusted fried chicken and although there's really nothing \"honey dusted\" about it, it was ok. I guess we were expecting something a little different from the menu description.   The server was nice. He did a good job. There was no wait to be seated. The food took a little longer than we hoped to come out, but nothing near like the last visit. I've been to other locations and I would just say that this one is beautiful inside, it's clean, it's nice, but overall it's just not as consistent as the other one I visited.",

    "text": "Tupelo gets a 3 because I ate here and I didn't die.  But I almost didn't even get to eat here because I couldn't find the damn button to get the elevator doors to open.  If there is a camera in the corner watching jackasses like me trying to find the button to push, I bet it's hilarious.    I was super excited to try the place (more excited to see Candyce, but excited about the food too).  At 5:00 on a somewhat gloomy Wednesday, there were only 2 other tables seated, but by the time we were leaving, the place was full and there were a few folks waiting outside (and more road-ragers in the parking lot stalking people for their parking spots).  Hardwood floors, slowly turning ceiling fans, reclaimed wood-paned windows - they are going for the laid back southern charm look, I suppose.  The hostess was very friendly, I was quickly seated since there was no one there.  Wait staff were very friendly and offered suggestions.  But... eh.  It was fine.  Nothing earth shattering, nothing new, nothing unusual.  I wouldn't wait 5 minutes to eat here again, much less the hours that others are reporting.  I am guessing The Liberty has seen an uptick in business from folks who don't want to wait an eternity to eat at the new place next door.  The food: The BISCUITS:  Ahhhh the much-praised biscuits... were fine.  Served room temp with a small cup of blueberry preserves or honey, they were kind of crumbly.  And the salt-dusted top half was not appetizing to me.  I tried to flick the salt off and covered it in the very fresh tasting blueberry preserves.  Not the best I have had, but not the worst (this is going to be a pattern throughout the meal).  2.5/5 Appalachian Egg Rolls ($9):  3 small egg rolls, cut in half, served with chunky mustard and a BBQ sauce.  Stuffed with shredded pork, greens, some other stuff.  The BBQ sauce was good, the egg rolls were fine.  Not worth $9. 2.5/5 Zippy-De-Do-Dah Sweet and Spicy Pork ($18):  Tender, well cooked pork drizzled with a smoky, sweet BBQ sauce.  Served with mac and cheese that was creamy but didn't really have any kind of flavor, and 4 spears of asparagus that were cooked well, mildly seasoned. The pork was the star of the meal.  3/5 Pecan Pie ($5.45):  Well plated, nice sized slice but, again, nothing special.  It didn't taste any better to me than the frozen Sara Lee pecan pies that I eat straight out of the metal pie pan. 3/5  As another reviewer stated, and this is small, but annoying - luke warm tea refills poured into glasses with no ice in them.  Meh.    All of the staff were hustling about once the place filled up - they are staffed well with friendly, competent folks for the large crowd, but I didn't have anything tonight that I would brave South End to get at again.",

    "text": "You know something's going right when the lunchtime wait for a table is 45 to 60 minutes!  Luckily, THC proves to be worth the wait and then some.  Now in fairness, I and my party of 5 stopped in for New Year's Day lunch at 1 PM.  It was packed but the hostess stand had things firmly under control and the adjacent bar space is the ideal place to get settled in and enjoy a local craft beer or cocktail.  Given the special day, I gave the drink list a gander and asked if there was any cocktail that didn't fall on the sweeter side of things.  Our bar server was refreshingly honest and admitted all their drinks were a bit sweet, but he directed me to the 'Paris of there South,' due to the complexity of flavors and the rye whiskey base.  Sweet?  Yes, but it was a very pleasing blend of bitters, elderflower and ginger beer.  I could have had a half dozen.  I should also note the 'Mega-Mosa\" here, which is a Mimosa that includes nearly a full pint of champagne.  Definitely not for just sipping and perfect for an extended brunch.  This bar alone will do well in this city.  We did advance our timeline by scoring a table in the bar area, which is all first-come first-serve seating.  My only complaint was the wait to get service started, but the two servers in this area seemed stretched out to the max and it wasn't for a lack of interest on their part.  In fact, our server acknowledged the wait and more than made up for it once he got to us, with a quick wit and spot-on service throughout.  He was as entertaining and quite professional, an ideal mix.  The menu largely breaks down into sandwiches, entrees, and breakfasts, with a big focus on Southern cooking and large portions.  There is no 'lite' menu here and it's all but impossible to order anything small.  Given the huge fluffy biscuits that come with any order, this will be a BIG meal, no way around it, so loosen up your belt and settle in.  I had a country breakfast plate and there eggs were cooked perfectly to order and came with a very large portion of country ham.  Home fries are thin sliced potatoes and, while good, were very oily and lacked a bit of crispness that would have made them pop a bit more.  All of our sides, even a very tasty swiss chard and asparagus, were pooling with oil upon arrival at the table.  All quite tasty, but really only adding to the heaviness of the meal.  My wife had the 'sassy garlic chicken' and it was rather tasty, especially with a nice peach-burbon glaze on top.  Again, portion sizes were large and it would not be impossible to share a single entree if you're not looking to blow it all out at a single sitting.  Omelettes and the sweet-potator pancake (even the kid's portion) are massive and will more than fill even a hearty appetite.  All are also highly recommended alternatives.  THC knows how to serve you some food and keep the taste factor high.  You will likely leave, however, feeling that there is no need to eat again for the day.  Definitely not a place to put on the regular rotation if you have any concern for the waistline, but a welcome addition to the city dining scene when the occasion calls for hearty fare with a recognizable Southern twist.  Good character, fine drinks, and they will make sure you leave quite full... this place is as sweet as their name.",

It was my fault for ordering scrambled eggs, though. They had clearly been sitting out for a while and were made along with a large batch. They were overcooked and lukewarm. And our server was not proactive in checking on us. It was busy so she was attending to multiple tables. I think it is an isolated incident, though, so I'll try again. But it will probably take a while since there are a lot of great brunch places here in Charlotte.",

The jalapeno fried egg BLT was spicy, per my liking has I love spicy food and unusually good as I usually do not like my eggs fried. We were there on the night that they did half-price bottles of wine and we had a great Chardonnay full bottle of wine for $17.00. Our service that night was exemplary, to say the least, as we arrived around 3:30, when the lunch crowd was gone and the dinner crowd and yet to arrive. Bravo @tupulohoney I'll be back!!!",

    "text": "Date of Visitation: 11/12/2017 around 6:00pm Reason: Friendsgiving Dinner Cost of meal: $58.46  (i) Two (2) seasonal mule DFT - These were alright. I wish they had a more prominent alcohol taste, but the pumpkin flavor did come through. I was just disappointed they didn't have what was displayed on the menu.   (ii) Fried Green Tomatoes - These were alright as well. The tomatoes were a little TOO tart and the breading was (slightly) falling off of the tomato especially if you added any kind of sauce/aioli to it.   (iii) Seared Southern Scallops - For the price that it was, it could have been better. Also, the scallops were a bit too charred on both sides and the presentation was kind of sloppy. All of the colors were kind of murky, brown, darkish, but the flavor made up for it. I've had some amazingly clean tasting scallops and this didn't hold up to my standard, They did give enough of everything else on the plate, but the main attraction wasn't prominent.   Decor - Very nice, southern, hometown but (medium) upscale kind of feel. Well decorated and there's PLENTY OF SPACE both inside & outside to accommodate (bigger) parties.   Service - Pretty good. I don't have any complaints besides the way she took our orders and the timing of bringing out everyone's food. My friend asked for no blue cheese crumbles on her $20 steak salad and they loaded it with them.   One thing I can say about Tupelo Honey Cafe (THC) is that they have some of the BEST HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS especially in NC.   --TrizzyO_o",

    "text": "Updating my review from 3 to 4 stars after being here a couple times now. Yes, it's True that the food may take awhile here, but I have not experienced the biscuit shortage again that I described in the below. Yes, the servers may take a little bit longer to come visit you but that's because this place is so popular they are slammed on the weekends! Yes, it's True you will wait a long time to be seated on the weekends if you don't make reservations.   Additionally, I now only come here if I make reservations and it makes a world of a difference, so thank you Tupelo for taking them!  Finally, I was recently impressed when I took my sister here for her birthday for brunch and they let her pick out any dessert she wanted for free! The banana pudding was outstanding!   Overall, this is now my go-to brunch spot in Charlotte whenever I have visitors in town. Just don't forget to make a reservation and you will love the Tupelo Honey Cafe!    -------  3 stars for service and price, 4 stars for food and decor. Allow me to elaborate...  Pros:  -Yummy breakfast with a southern spin. Every entree comes with a complimentary homemade biscuit with jam \"prior\" to your meal. (This was not my experience, see below)   -Free parking for guests, located in a mini shopping center.   -If seated at bar, snow/ice is wrapped around on bar to keep your drink cold (see picture). Cool idea!   Cons:  -Slow service. Don't come here on a Sunday when you need to have a quick breakfast. I specifically asked if I needed to order toast with my meal (not included, an extra $1) since I ordered over easy eggs, and I was assured \"No, since a biscuit will come prior to your meal.\" This was wrong. I waited 10 minutes after my meal came for this biscuit,  before I could even eat my eggs, which by then was cold.  -Wait will most likely be 30 minutes to sit on a Sunday unless you grab a seat at the bar. Expect longer for a big party.  -Coffee is $3 and their large soup-like mugs make the coffee go cold pretty quickly unless you drink it fast. And when you do drink it fast, don't expect it to get refilled fast. I had to ask for refills 4x. Not once did my waitress offer to refill my coffee.",

Luckily there was a cart with plates nearby so we helped ourselves.  Our server seemed uninterested but there were others that were called on that were very helpful.  The food was mediocre at best.  The buttermilk fried chicken was over fried and burnt.  The chicken was dry.  Won't be coming here again",

    "text": "I really wish I could give half stars because really, I would give 3.5 stars. I like this place, but it isn't a place that I crave or often choose to go to. The star of the show to me here is the home fries. I think they are awesome and really like it with the hot sauce. My boyfriend had the southern fried BLT (add pimento cheese) and it was tasty. He also liked the fries.   I also had the sweet potato pancake. It was just okay to me. It is one giant and thick pancake, which makes it really hard to eat. I barely ate 1/3 of it because it was so massive. It was the only pancake they had on the menu, which was disappointing because I really like pancakes.   The negatives for me about this place is that there always seems to be a wait, food can take a long time to come out because it's so busy, there isn't an extensive brunch menu (and I love brunch), and it's kinda expensive (specifically the bar drinks).   Overall, I think this place is okay. It isn't my favorite place but I don't hate it. I think it's a decent addition to the Charlotte brunch scene.",

    "text": "Finally we were able to try out Tupelo for weekend brunch! We walked in earlier today to find a 10-15 minute wait for 2 people, not bad, but we just ended up seating ourselves in the bar area. The waitress was nice but, very unorganized. We waited at the empty table we found for a few minutes before she came to wipe it off. We pretty much new what we wanted so we were ready to go, ordered the fried green tomatoes to split and then I ordered the Eggs Betty and he ordered the Fried chicken platter with fried okra. The place got pretty crowded after we sat down so the food took a bit. I was super excited to try their biscuits and berry preserve but, the server never brought them by!   Our fried green tomatoes came out, yum!!! The bf loved the goat cheese grits even though he hates goat cheese normally..shhhh I didn't tell him. Very creamy, delish. The actual tomatoes were fried to perfection with the perfect amount of batter but, a little too thick of a tomato slice. Still very good with the flavorful red pepper coolie. I couldn't help myself after we finished the fried green tomatoes and asked the server to bring out the complimentary biscuits and preserves everyone else but us received (docked a star). I'm so glad I did because they were so good! Buttery, flaky goodness! The preserves are spot on! They have blackberry but you can also buy to take home and they have strawberry and blueberry preserves as well. This would be perfect if served with honey butter or something.   The entrees! I was already full at this point so its just nibbling from here on out. My Eggs Betty included the most perfect poached eggs I've ever tasted, wonderfully runny! YUMM! The potato cracklins were super crispy but, needed some seasoning. All in all great entree that will for sure leave you in food coma status. The bf scarfed his fried chicken down, I didn't even get try try any lol. But, his fried okra side was perfect! Not too heavily battered but, still very crispy and extra fresh! I will be getting these next time.   The server took her time bringing the check out, we were basically sitting there for 30 minutes after we finished eating. She was nice but, needs to be a tad more organized for weekend brunch, I'm sure it can get stressful if you aren't on top of it.",

Hostess was snooty in the way she asked if we had a reservation (note it was 815 in the morning on a Sunday and the restaurant was about empty) and the food just wasn't that great.  Nothing special and certainly not worth the $100 price take for 4 entrees. For example the pecan pie French toast was $14 and it was literally three slices of bread layered with a smushed piece of pie...very underwhelming. The burrata fried green sandwich was poorly assembled, only half having the spicy spread.  Also the kids menu only offered pancakes by way of traditional breakfast fare.",

I order fried green tomatoes on goat cheese grits. It should be copies and mandatory for everyone to eat this dish !  Then Sam the waitress  brought a warm biscuit ( no butter needed ) and fresh blueberry spread out of this world. Dinner was fried chicken with Home fried potatoes and collared greens with thick meat bacon in it. I literally had to stop eating bcuz it was so good.  Then as I finished dinner at 6 pm the church bells started playing HOW GREAT THOU ART & it was horrible but wonderful to sit outside on the balcony and hear it. The service was a 10 and the food was super hot and no surprises ( like truffle oil) on the food.  The cost reasonable .......considering the whole local feel. I will be back !",

The restaurant is huge inside with plenty of space for seating, including an outdoor area.  I went for breakfast and ordered the Chicken & Sweet Potato Pancakes and they were delicious. The perfect blend of sweet & salty, and large enough to fill you for pretty much the whole day!  Our waitress was extremely nice & recommended a few options, including the meal I ordered. She brought our complimentary biscuits with their homemade grape jam and honey. SO GOOD. My pancake was nice and fluffy, and had white power and apple cider bacon on top - and then the fried chicken to follow. It was definitely one of the better chicken and pancake breakfast meals I've had!   Pricing is a little higher than most spots I'd say, but it's great, quality food with A+ service and near shops to walk it all off after you're all done.",

    "text": "Oh. My. Word. This was my favorite meal in Charlotte! We came for brunch on Sunday and were pleasantly surprised there wasn't a huge wait!   I ordered the southwestern omelette and it was one of the best I've had! It had chorizo in the middle with salsa, avocado, cheese and topped with sour cream. My husband got a fried chicken dish and loved it. Our friends got the Southwestern omelette and the breakfast bowl. We were all impressed with our selections and the portions were just the right size.   This was an awesome find. My husband and I keep saying we wish we had this place in Chicago!",

    "text": "Opening weekend seemed to be a success so I decided to go today for the 2nd time, to celebrate my birthday. I was very excited to bring a group of co-workers with me. We waited 20 minutes for a seat but since we arrived during the lunch rush, we were patient. Just as before the biscuits, jam & honey were amazing but unfortunately that was the extent of my good experience. We waited a long time for our food (we're at about an hour in at this point) and once it came so did the requests. Mayo, dressing for a friends salad, etc. our waitress seemed young and a bit inexperienced to handle multiple requests as she would bring one item out at a time. After my burger sat getting cold for another 10 minutes I asked again for mayo and was told \"it's coming!\". At that point I'm losing my appetite because of her attitude and service but it was my birthday lunch after all so I was going to enjoy this burger....or was I? Nope, my med well burger was med RARE at best once I cut into it and at that point the rest of my party was more than 1/2 way through their meal. I was done. The manager said she would comp my meal, give me a gift card (which she never gave me) and bring me something else from the menu but seemed like she honestly didn't care that my birthday lunch was ruined...and they still brought me the check for the \"comped\" grilled cheese sandwich I had to choke down.   This did not seem like the same place I had dinner opening weekend. Had it only been issues with the food & had I not been disrespected by the staff, I might have returned once they get the kinks worked out.   Tip: the wood floors are EXTREMELY slippery (hold the wax, folks) and an elderly lady fell flat on her back while we were there. I was wearing heels and almost slipped myself. Be aware of that & wear shoes with some sort of traction or be very cautious when walking on them.",

The weather was perfect and I love that the outdoor area is on the second level. They have lights strung out through the trees and around the porch which were nice when it got dark.  We all sampled their Tupelo Ale which was good, mild so it would be nice for a lot of people. We also tried their pimento cheese dip with tortillas and the cheese was more like a cheese dip with pimento flavor. It was good, but I would recommend getting the fried green tomatoes for sure.  I had the veggie melt with no mushrooms and it was delicious, it didn't have a top piece of bread to it which I actually kind of enjoyed because it wasn't too much bread but rather about the vegetables. It was def. the kind of sandwich you eat with a knife and fork! As my side item I had the fried green tomatoes and they were delicious! Seriously so good.  My husband ordered their black bean burger which he enjoyed, I also tried and there was a sweetness to it that I couldn't place exactly where it was coming from.  My mother in law ordered the chicken piccata which she loved, it was topped with shrimp. I didn't sample this as I don't eat meat but she was very pleased with it. It was covered in a cream sauce.  Overall the experience was wonderful and I can't wait to go back soon!",

    "text": "Anytime I go to Asheville people tell me to eat at Tupelo Honey, but I've never had time to go. So when they opened in Charlotte I was excited to be able to try it. Unfortunately this was my first and last visit.  The service was awful. Before I proceed, I should mention there were many empty tables and booths. We waited for a long time to just get menus. Another lengthy wait before we could order. The food came fairly fast though. The waiter didn't ask if we needed anything, just sat the food down and walked away. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries, so he wanted ketchup. It was impossible to get the attention of the 5 servers standing behind the bar talking, so I had to get up and get ketchup off an unbussed table.   While we ordered another table was seated next to us. By the time we got our food they still had not received menus. After I got my own ketchup one of them walked up to the front of the restaurant and picked up her own menus.  The food was pretty tasty. The biscuits with honey and jam were a great little appetizer.  I was told the burger was good, as was the veggie sandwich I ordered. We sat with empty plates for a lengthy time, unable to get a bartender or server to notice us. It took forever for someone to ask if we wanted anything else or just the check. We probably would have ordered another beer, but the restaurant missed out on that. Instead we asked for our check, which again took forever. We left full, but not willing to come back.   There were so many servers hanging around talking,they were clearly overstaffed. Maybe they would be more attentive to paying customers if there was less time to chat. I honestly think we could have walked away without paying and no one would have noticed. Maybe the Asheville location has better service, but with the abundance of good food in Asheville, they will unfortunately never get my business.",

Either we were drunk that time or they majorly sold out. The Mac and cheese tasted like velveeta. It was awful and certainly not scratch made. I would have rather spent my Mother's Day spending 30 minutes to make it myself rather than pay good money for that garbage. The duck was tiny and dry, the food sat under the heat lamps for probably 10 minutes, and the service left a lot to be desired. We usually aren't to type to whine about first world problems but we were very excited for some southern cooking and wasted 60.00 instead. Poor showing, Tupelo Honey. Poor showing.",

There can be a bit of a wait, but that is the case with any decent restaurant.  EDIT: I still love the food at this restaurant, however, try to pay cash if you can. I had to remove a star because I used a particular credit card here (and had only used that particular card there) and within 2-3 weeks had several fraudulent charges between $200-$300 each at grocery stores.  Not necessarily accusing anyone, but I will say the waitress went out of her way and into the back for a while before coming back with a receipt to sign...  Use cash if you can.",

    "text": "This place will definitely be in our regular rotation. We got here about 600 on Friday night, which was just in time to beat the big crowds.  Service was extremely attentive and prompt.  I ordered my 4 year old daughter a grilled cheese sandwich and fruit along with our apps and she literally ate the entire plate of food, plus a biscuit, which is very unusual! I can only assume it was great!! And those biscuits. Soooooo yummy. Flaky and buttery and hot!! I could have eaten 10! They may be my favorite biscuit from a restaurant. Fried green tomatoes were nice; I'm not really a connoisseur of these so will defer to others, I thought they were good but only the second time I've ever eaten them. For dinner, I got the crab cakes, which looked a little bready, so I was concerned, but were delicious with lots of crab. They had a hard crust vs most with a soft crust, but I liked them a lot. And the Swiss chard and asparagus mix on the side was yummy. I wished there were more of it. I tried my husband's pulled pork and it was super yummy and a HUGE portion. We had a table of 8 and everyone seemed very happy with their food. We eat out a lot so we will definitely be back.   One piece of advice, we ordered so many apps that we were totally full after entrees. Next time I will skip some so we can try the desserts!  Only downer is parking but I can't knock the restaurant for that. The parking sucks though. Be prepared to walk a block unless you want to run up your blood pressure looking for a space in the tiny adjacent lot.",

    "text": "Three stars for this place after averaging the quality of all aspects of my trip here. I came here with three others during a busy brunch rush on a Sunday. Thanks to putting our names on the list ahead of time, we are able to skip the hour and a half wait - 5 stars for that decision. However, our good fortune was spoiled by the server who introduced herself with a very melancholy attitude and appeared to be relatively clueless about the menu; she was very poor at helping a member of our group who was gluten free (she thought rice had gluten, so getting good answers about the right dish to get was clearly futile) - 1 Star. The food ranged in quality. My Shoo Mercy Omelet was really good (5 stars), but my friend's southwestern omelet that was supposed to have chorizo basically tasted like an omelet full of Manwich (1 Star and I highly advise this dish changing to be REAL chorizo). The other dishes - a breakfast bowl and salad - were two and four stars, respectively as the breakfast bowl in particular had very soupy grits. Average that out and what do you get? Three stars.",

They are very accommodating but can be crowded. The Raleigh and Charlotte locations are fine for big groups of families but Asheville is smaller and I would plan to get there early before you are too hungry and have to wait for a table.",

    "text": "Geez this place is so good! Went here this past Saturday to experience the amazingness of Tupelo Honey. We have been to the Asheville location many times and couldn't wait to try it out.  We walked here from our apartment.....yes, lucky us! So, I can't comment on the ease of parking but the parking lot looked extremely full when we left.  We arrived around 5:45 and was told that it was a 30 minute wait. I saw an empty table in the bar area and asked the hostess if the bar area was first come first serve. It was, so we sat there. Just a warning, the bar area fills up super fast (especially now that it is cold outside and no one wants to wait out doors). So, if you want a quiet, non-crowding meal, you may just wanna wait for a table.   Drinks- We both ordered the Tupelo Honey Rye Ale. It was delicious and decently priced. Their craft brew selections were pretty good, especially those within the state.  Biscuits- The biscuits are like a slice of heaven! The come with a thng of blackberry jam and some of their honey (of course!) I split mine in half so I could have one half with jam and one half with honey....best of both worlds!  Food- I ordered the grilled cheese (pimento and havarti) with a cup of tomato soup and my husband ordered the fried chicken with a mushroom sauce and mashed cauliflower. Both meals were very good. Some of the best pimento cheese I have ever had! The tomato soup is a little on the sweeter side. My husbands chicken was the winner though, soooooo tasty. The cauliflower side was a little off....I don't know, maybe not enough cheese or something. But the chicken, man that chicken!  All in all, we will absolutely return. Just come super early or at weird times to avoid a wait because, yes, there will 100% be a good wait there.",

The chicken was really good, although kind of small. Biscuits were great with their homemade jam. Our favorite part of the meal was the warm pimento cheese. Absolutely amazing. My big gripe was our server. She was slow to respond to us at first. And then she got seated s table of 8-9 people and we were completely forgot about at that point. I actually had to flag down different servers for refills and to get our check brought to us. This is pretty unacceptable and I don't know if we'll return with service like that. It kind of killed our anniversary dinner.",

Our waitress came quickly to her our drink orders and when she returned told us she would give us time to look over the menu and if we had any questions. She came back quickly and took our orders (I HATE when waiters/waitresses take too long to get your order after dropping off your drinks!)  She gave us a short history on the restaurant: where the name came from, locations, where the food comes from, etc. I was excited to hear that almost all of the food is local and grass fed. Don't judge, I'm going through a local foodie hipster phase (I feel like a lot of people in Charlotte do between Plaza Midwood and NoDa).   Our food was amazing! I uploaded pics for your viewing pleasure. I must say the biscuits/jam were my FAVORITE part! Its food and appearance, both an ode to the South, are a Southerner's dream. In my opinion it was an upgrade of Cracker Barrel! A Charlotte favorite, it's definitely worth a try.   You're welcome.",

    "text": "Biscuits.  Yes, I said it, the biscuits are great.  I came here for a tasting as a +1 for a Yelp Elite event and then came back on a Monday night with friends and family.  First, the menu is big, but no Cheesecake Factory.  Fortunately after a tasting and a dine-in visit, I got a chance to sample a few things including the crab cakes, scallops, Appalachian Egg Rolls, catfish and goat cheese grits.  Out of those my favorites were the scallops (perfectly cooked) and the egg rolls mostly because there was pulled pork inside!  And of course the biscuits with the berry jam & the tupelo honey.  Apparently the story is the honey used to come from bees in the Tupelo, MS area, but recent devastation caused a shortage.  Now they are getting the honey from a similar strain of bees, hence keeping with Tupelo.  The crab cakes, I felt, had a bit too much breading and a more cakey consistency.  The catfish was normal, nothing special.  The goat cheese grits is not your Mama's grits.  It took me slightly off guard as I'm used to traditional cheese grits, but I love goat cheese, and of course the two together can take a little to get used to.   The crowd was lively on a Monday night, but probably because they just opened recently.  Parking can also be an issue as both times I had to park on a side street since the lot was always full.  Come prepared.  I'll come back to try the many other creative items on the menu making it a fresh change in the traditional southern fare.   Would I like more biscuits.  Yes, I'll have one more.... plate.",

    "text": "Welcome to Charlotte, Tupelo Honey Cafe! Yelpers, get ready to have your taste buds delighted.   I've been anxiously awaiting Tupelo Honey's arrival to the Charlotte food scene. I've heard nothing but amazing things about it but the 1.5-2 hour wait at the one in Asheville left me pining away. But not anymore, as we have our very own! It fills the space once occupied by the Pewter Rose Bistro.  We were lucky enough to join Tupelo Honey Cafe for a soft opening tonight. Usually restaurants use soft openings to work out kinks and problems, but it didn't seem like they really needed it. Everything was already operating like a smooth oiled machine. The service was excellent and the food was all superb. They were serving a limited menu but there was still something for everyone.   Homemade Pimento Cheese and Tortilla Chips - Awesome. The pimento cheese was served hot, reminiscent of a Southern version on queso dip. The chips were also hot and fresh.   Biscuits: Fresh biscuits served with Tupelo honey and berry jam. So.Freakin.Good. My search for the best biscuit has ended. Tupelo wins. These biscuits are light, fluffy, flaky, buttery, salty, and just damn good.   SHOO-Mercy Shirmp and Grits: Oh man. A dozen perfectly cooked, succulent shrimp with bacon, caramelized onions, spinach, and sauteed mushrooms all served over goat cheese grits... Read that again... Goat cheese grits! If you aren't a fan of goat cheese, skip this dish as it is a very dominant flavor. Or better yet, try them and you may discover that goat cheese isn't all that bad like I did :)   I also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Saltimbocca. So, so, so good. The chicken was perfectly cooked. So juicy. The country ham, Havarti and Marsala sauce pushed the dish over the top. The cheese smashed cauliflower were a bit of a let down. They just weren't as exciting as I wanted them to be.   Finished the dinner off with a piece of Bourbon Pecan Pie. Perfect crust. Tons of pecans on top and ooey gooey pecan pie filling in the middle. You could smell the butter in every bite. Definitely the perfect desert for those with a sweet tooth.   Side notes... They share the parking lot with The Liberty. They are on the second floor. There are two staircases and an elevator you can use to get up to them. The patio looks awesome! Can't wait for the weather to get nice to enjoy it. The space inside is beautiful. I love the exposed brick. They have a really nice bar area with TVs and a great selection of local beers on tap and tasty cocktails. Their mint iced tea was a bit on the sweet side for me but I loved the fresh mint flavor. Our waitress, Kat, was very friendly and attentive.  I can't wait to try out more of their menu!! See you soon Tupelo Honey Cafe :)",

However, you do pay for the quality.  Ambiance The above section applies consistently to all locations I've eaten at but the ambiance can vary quite a bit. The Raleigh location has a very \"Raleigh\" vibe; clean, warm, straight lines  doesn't want to rock the boat, absolutely nothing to complain about. But it lacks the spacious and inviting veranda of Charlotte and the somewhat charming somewhat maddening \"coziness\" of the Asheville location. Charlotte's inside and outside are both far more spacious than the other locations and the beautiful veranda in Charlotte manages to exude coziness and openness simultaneously, by far my favorite location. They have their own parking lot with plenty of spaces and we had no trouble parking. They are on the second floor and even have an elevator.  Bottom line: A must eat brunch spot in Charlotte.",

The location was very easy to find. The atmosphere was fun and relaxing. We chose to eat outside as we are from New York and wanted to soak up as much sun as possible. The wait staff was great. Always asking how we were doing and keeping up on the water refills. My wife went with a fresh grilled chicken salad and I chose the grilled salmon. Both choices were excellent. I would highly recommend this place as it has options to suit anyone's pallet.",

They seated us right away and then the men took longer to meet up with us than expected! Although this could be a huge nuisance for our server, William, he didn't act annoyed at all and took GREAT care of us! Checked in often, offered us drinks and refills, and when we asked for appetizer recommendations he was super helpful! Thanks William for taking great care of us and being so patient and helpful!!   Oh yeah, and all the food was amazing! We had the French toast with blueberry appetizer while waiting for the guys. Highly recommend it! Their biscuits for the table are always a huge hit and since it was basically lunch time by the time the rest of the party joined us we got the Brussels to munch on and I have to say, I loved them!!   Great brunch all around!!",

This beautiful work of art is called the \"Queen Mary\", appropriate for the Queen City and is the creation of Tupelo Honey, new southern cuisine. It's made with a mix using roasted yellow tomatoes and garlic, Demitri's bloody seasoning, lemon juice and vodka OR moonshine! (go ahead, guess which we chose). Garnished with lemon, lime, pickled okra, a PIMENTO CHEESE stuffed olive, grilled SHRIMP, BACON, but not just any bacon baby, MAPLE PEPPER BACON, celery, asparagus, and a pickled jalapeno! We think an amen is in order.  20 ounces of awesome. The perfect drink for kicking back on the porch, enjoying a nice southern breeze on a warm summer day.",

By the end of our meal the waitress was pleading with us to \"give them another chance.\" There are no other chances in Charlotte. There are so many other great restaurants in this town where I'd rather spend my money. I had a reservation for 8 at 1:00 pm Sunday January 14, 2018. This is how it went down: 1:00 pm we arrive with our entire party. Check in to find out they are running 15-20 minutes behind. No problem... until... 1:30 Still no table. Check back in with the hostess. \"We're cleaning your table off right now.\" 1:40 Still no table. BS. We get drinks at the bar. (The only good part of the experience.) 1:45 They finally seat us... 45 minutes after our reservation time! As we are seated they comp our group 2 appetizers. Nice try... but wait... the suck continues. 2:00 PM We wait another 15 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order. She finally arrives and takes our drink order, and we didn't waste the opportunity to give her our app and main order. Who knows when she would be back... right? 2:15 PM No apps yet. Everyone is ravenous. 2:30 PM The food comes out... but NO APPETIZERS. Yes, the two apps you comped us never come out! Really? Everyone is served at the same time except for one person. 2:40 PM The same person has no meal while everyone else is eating. Now it's time to have a talk with the manager. He apologizes... and takes 50% off the meal (except alcohol) and throws in dessert. 2:45 PM the final meal comes out. The food is ok... 3:00 PM Strap in people... we ordered dessert. 3:30 PM Dear God... the desserts finally make the table, and they are freaking small. I mean a $9 cake is really a dense muffin. Jeez. 3:50 PM We get our checks. 4:05 We get our receipts and leave. Are you keeping score at home? 3 hours for a meal, people. Never again.",

Great food but ridiculous that on a Monday night the hostess would not seat us in a booth after we requested to sit there (my pregnant wife and my two 75 year old parents). See photos. Reason was booths are reserved for 6 people. We only had 4. Also, most restaurants take your used silverware after biscuits and apps. The waitress here says you should keep your silverware...so I laid my jelly covered fork and knife on the table. Hmm. Get some southern charm and hospitality to match your food.   UPDATE: The manager replied with a nice email and to correct the problem. Manager agreed we should have never been told we couldn't eat at the booth with 4 people. Thank you for your response!",

We asked for an outside seating, which was a must because the weather was lovely!! I see a lot of families coming here all dressed up nicely for brunch - love(: I came here wanting to order their French toast or shakshuka which I saw on their menu online, but I was so disappointed to not see it on their menu! (Whyyyy) So I stuck with the kale grilled shrimp salad and the lavender limenade. The lavender limenade was really good! You could taste the lavender and they didn't overly sweeten it so still had the sourness from the lime which is perfect! But the salad, whyyyyy does it taste like I'm eating straight up grass? The yogurt dressing was okay, the pears added a hint of sweetness- great, shrimp was big and banging but the lettuce and radishes tasted like they straight up ripped it up from the ground. My cousins ordered the fried chicken burger, it looked SO bomb but it was legit sitting in a pool of grease. (I'm not even exaggerating) Also, the fries were super duper soggy & tasted like regular frozen fries. Overall the presentation of the foods were awesome! But the taste sadly disappointed me. If I'm ever coming back it would be for sure for the biscuits!",

The problems started when our food was brought to us - we all ordered pancakes, which no syrup was brought to us and our bacon was under cooked; we asked our server for syrup and properly cooked bacon. Overall, we waited about 10 - 12 minutes for these things to come out to us while the rest of our food was getting cold. When the bacon was brought to our table one of the servers sat it down saying \"here is your extra, extra, extra crispy bacon\" - it wasn't crispy, it was burnt. Surely, there is a medium between undercooked food and over cooked food - and there is, it's properly cooked food. After waiting and then receiving burnt bacon none of the food was appetizing anymore and I was really disappointed.   When our server came back we asked her to speak to the manager, after explaining to the manager what happened she offered to take the bacon off our bill and give us the \"family and friends discount.\" We then waited another 15 - 20 minutes for our checks to be organized and pay.   From now on, I will stick to the Greenville location where my experience has always been great.",

What we ordered:  - Blueberry champagne short stack (free with email signup) - worth an email sign up to try it, but the pancakes are kid-sized haha  - Southern shakshuka - you can't go wrong ordering this! A good balance of grits, egg, tomatoes and avocado - Apple cider pork belly hash - essentially potatoes + 2 eggs. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and well made, but I don't think it was substantial enough to be considered an entree. It would be a great appetizer though!

I had never heard of this place but I've been Yelpin... (watermelon) and trying new stuff. It's a little pricey but worth it. You get a lot of food too.   Their collard greens and mac' n cheese were FIYA. And their servers are as attentive as Mr. Meeseeks when it comes to attending to your needs. I'll definitely be back.   The entrance is a little weird as it's upstairs or you have to take an elevator up one flight to sort of find the lobby. Other than that it's a great spot.  Kaepernick is right to take a knee.

The complimentary biscuits and jam were the perfect start to a delicious meal. Several of us had the pork grilled cheese, others had the chicken blt. Just thinking about them is making me hungry! Definitely go for the Mac n cheese side! If you are not a spicy lover, put the spicy honey on the side (one friend made the mistake of ordering it on her food and was not as happy as if she'd left it off!).   This location was very cold. During warmer months, I'm sure it's absolutely perfect bit with the temperature dip, definitely wear warmer clothes.",

Ambience is as expected...very spacious inside, with casual, woodsy decor, and great upstairs/patio dining options.  Menu was also as expected...with a good variety of Southern/Low-Country specialties.  Service was fair...in that our waiter TRIED, but we can tell he was having a hard time.  They seemed to be short-staffed, and this waiter was frantically rushing from way across the room (again, this restaurant is very spacious) to our table to various other tables in between.  Nothing major, but there were delays in getting our drinks and appetizer.  Then the food.  Despite our high expectations, the food just wasn't that good.  The Biscuits were OK, the Fried Cauliflower was OK, and my Shrimp and Grits were on the bad side...with too much pepper in the Grits.  My husband also said his Fried Chicken was just average, though the Collards were really good.  Even the Cheesecake dessert was just So-So.  Also, must add that the Sangria was THE worst I've ever had.  Guess I should have read the ingredients more closely?  It didn't look or taste like Sangria...more like some super-strong mixed alcohol, with such a bitter taste.  Truly horrible...and $10.00 at that!  I almost sent it back, but decided to be nice, and poured a ton of honey and sweetener to make it taste better lol.  To end on a positive note, we were seated very comfortably...in a super-large booth.  Overall, this was quite a disappointing dining experience ...especially considering the fact that it was our anniversary.  I saw that this restaurant had a 4-star rating on Yelp, so I expected 4-star food...but for us, at least on this particular night, it was barely a 3.",

I went to Tupelo Honey during lunch last week and was awed by the architecture and atmosphere of the building, particularly the deck and the rustic bricks. We were seated immediately and ordered some appetizers! We got fried green tomatoes and Brussels sprouts. ALSO - I could eat those biscuits with fresh jam and honey FOREVER (best thing about the south). The fried green tomatoes were crispy and flavorful and served on a bed of grits which were so good we were just eating them off the plate when they were leftover. The brussel sprouts were also cooked and seasoned to perfection.   For my lunch, I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which was served stifling hot and fresh. I would recommend asking for more of the Dijon mustard to top off the sandwich. By this point in the meal, I was not super hungry, but I did enjoy this sandwich immensely.   I would definitely come back here and am ready to try one of their infamous brunches!!",

We had reservations for 11, and they were really cool when we had to call because our uber got lost and we were going to be late. We were seated immediately and drinks were taken promptly. Our friend ordered the massive Bloody Mary and was very impressed by it. The mimosas were standard, with pulpy OJ. The only drink letdown was the margarita, which was 99% sour mix.   As for the food, some of the brunch price points are a little high, but you do get a generous portion of food. Everyone loved their complimentary biscuits and there were no complaints to be had with the food! The flannel hash was my choice, and it certainly kept me full for the whole day. The avacado toast was another clear winner at the table, along with the French toast.    Definitely a place to take guests, or for a special occasion, or for just a decadent brunch.",

Fried okra is the jam spot, especially with their white sauce. The spicy avocado and egg sandwich was  great! Being a vegetarian and having something with that much flavor and protein was amazing. It is hard to find any form of sanwiches to eat. Let alone, ones that taste that good! Also had the tomato soup with grilled cheese sticks. YUM! The whiskey mule was perfect with everything we ordered. Presentation was on par too. Love to eat with my eyes too.  Long story short, go here. They have easy parking, a ton of variety, and a really friendly staff. They always seem to be busy and on a wait.... in my opinion, that is never a bad thing. The wait is worth it!",

He was mostly prompt but there was some lag after our food was delivered. I ordered the southern shakshuka and everything but the eggs were phenomenal.  They were grossly undercooked and once broken open both the white and yolk were liquid. I was able to successfully scoop them out of the grits. I flagged down another server who took them and I asked him to please have them cook the white but leave the yolk runny. After nearly all of my food was consumed, our waiter brought back to hard cooked eggs. It was disappointing but he was apologetic and quickly replaced them with properly cooked eggs.   The reasons for my reducing my rating to three stars were the following...  1) The under cooked eggs and the lack of the quick replacement  2) The table in the window were not clean at all and there was a spider web that was disturbing  3) The complimentary biscuits were incredibly salty to the point they were inedible.   I will definitely give this place another chance as I feel the good outweighs the bad.",

    "text": "The whole area is filled with delights and interests. However we stopped in at this one... I'm soooo glad we did!  Driving down the main road with GOS and we still almost missed it. There is only a small sign off the side of the building coming from the way we came. I barely caught it. Be sure to be watching.  Once we found it and walked around the front we saw a cute elevator to go up in.  It is only on the second level but up we went. When the doors opened they opened up to a wonderful long galley  style deck. It was spacious, stylish and inviting.  We went through the door to the hostess stand only to find the most adorable inside area as well! The Decor was so cool. Free standing windows and doors all over, high ceilings, an open view to the kitchen, lots of space, and just an overall all relaxing and hip vibe! We loved it instantly.  The menu is built with lots of combinations, mixes of flavors, and elevated comfort foods.  I started with the blueberry sparkling punch. This is way way way sweet! Powerful taste but I think I needed a dentist after just a sip. I think a bit of soda water in it to tone it down might have helped. But it had a great blueberry punch for sure.  They brought out homemade biscuits, blueberry preserves and honey for the table. These were decadent... I'm glad they didn't bring out more or I would have gorged myself on just these.  For my main lunch I had the BBQ chicken press: smoked jalapeno bbq sauce, sliced apples, white cheddar cheese, garlic buttermilk ranch on a grilled flatbread... and it was Oooohhh My Goddie Toooooo Hottie delicious!! I even got it with a side of pinto beans that were not too bad...(I don't normally like pinto beans but these are good) trying to branch out.  Our waiter was excellent... very friendly and attentive. We did not want for anything.  This eatery was a True find! I wish we had this in Pflugerville! It would be a huge hit here as well.",

    "text": "On a trip to Charlotte, I was looking for a dinner spot on a Friday night. I checked out the most reviewed restaurants in town on Yelp, and Tupelo Honey was at the top of the list. I stopped by with a friend and we got a table on the patio. Tupelo is located in a trendy shopping center with several other bars, restaurants, and a tattoo parlor. They do have a parking lot but finding a spot can become tricky at peak hours. I found one of the last spots as someone was leaving right when I pulled up.   Tupelo has an awesome craft cocktails menu even though they're pretty pricey. I went with their version of the mojito. From there, they start you off with some delicious biscuits and jam. I always appreciate a complimentary starter!  Appalachian pork with two sides (4.5/5): the pork loin came with a tangy BBQ sauce and your choice of two sides. I went with the cheese grits and tomato basil soup. While the soup was really good, they barely give you any of it. It was served in more of a platter than a bowl which was bizarre. Especially since the serving sizes of their other sides like their grits and fries are generous. The cheese grits were great and complimented my Southern dish well.   Service was also awesome throughout. Tupelo Honey has a great ambiance whether you're outside on the patio, inside, or at the bar.",

Both were also so heavy we couldn't finish either even tho we were sharing. Tho I will blame some of that on the basket of hot pillowy biscuits that preceded the meal that were irresistible.  Also we got two Margs nothing extra ordinary but tasty none the less seeing as how both were polished off.  I can def see why everyone talks about this place. Would be happy to return for brunch anytime!",

    "text": "From a service perspective, my experiences have been pretty mixed -- sometimes I get an attentive waiter, other times I have to flag down other staff members for silverware and drink refills -- but the food has always been consistently good.   The deviled eggs and crispy sprouts have been my go-to starters, and I get one or the other just about every time I've visited. Of the entrees, so far the hanger steak is my favorite--mine have been perfectly cooked, with the most delicious green beans. It's just the right amount of food so that I leave satisfied but not uncomfortably stuffed. I also enjoy the Appalachian pork. The spicy sriracha sauce it comes with isn't that spicy and adds a the honey adds a nice sweetness to the pork. (I recommend getting the sprouts for your side--they pair very well with the sriracha sauce, too.)  From the bar, I recommend the wildflower moscow mule (VERY refreshing, especially on a hot night out on the deck) and the lavender and honeysuckle lemondrop. One of these days, I'll have to stop by for breakfast and a bloody mary from their list.   I enjoy sitting outside, and sometimes wonder if that's why I've had trouble with service -- maybe the servers also have tables indoors they're juggling? Or maybe, since I'm usually a party of one, I'm just overlooked. But if they could get their service issues figured out, I would come here more often.",

Found Tupelo Honey and based on the great reviews decided to give it a try. OMG so glad a did!  Its on the second floor and they have outside seating as well. Service was super friendly from beginning to end. Everything on the menu looks delicious, was hard to decide so we ordered a few things to try  Food  -Southern Shakshuka: two baked eggs, scratch-made creole sauce, sliced avocado, served over stone-ground goat cheese grits  -Old Skool' Breakfast Bowl: two sunny-side up eggs*, potato cracklins, black eyed peas, cheddar cheese, bacon & sausage crumbles, goat cheese grits  -Sweet potato pancakes   Only con is that they dont have lattes or cappuccinos and their regular coffee is very weak, not tasty at all. Our waitress mentioned a lot of people have complained about it.  Amazing food! If you can definitely stop by Tupelo and you won't be disappointed. Wish NYC had one",

The biscuits and blueberry jelly were bomb! The place wasn't crowded but it got busy about 6PM.  I enjoyed my meal which was a basic smoked salmon Caesar salad.  The fried chicken looked really good even though I didn't have any but everyone seemed very satisfied.  I'm only giving a 3 star rating because this was my first experience.

Second of all, you HAVE to try the Queen Mary (and don't let your cheap friends convince you to get the Plain Jane, it just wont be the same). Third of all, the atmosphere is great, and Chef D is the best.",

    "text": "Went for brunch on Sunday, knowing they would be slammed we made reservations ahead of time for our party of 5. We were sat pretty close to the time we arrived which was great because it was PACKED.   Tupelo is really pretty inside, I love the southern vibes. There are small details that really add to the atmosphere - the logo on the napkins and the dishware, I loved the feel of it all.  Service was really slow, we sat down at noon and didn't receive our food until well after 1:00pm. Our waitress was apologetic, but it definitely put a damper on the experience. She seemed to have too many tables so while the food was held up in the kitchen, we also sat there with empty coffee cups and water glasses. I think if she had been able to leave a carafe of water bring over more biscuits it would have helped us from getting antsy.   The biscuits are fantastic, served with honey and jam they really make the experience better. I love the presentation and that they are served warm. These are included at no extra charge.   Now, the brunch. We each ordered something different - the Old Skool Breakfast Bowl received the most praise. The sweet potato pancakes were tasty, but they were thin and the presentation was sloppy. Same with the breakfast combo, everything was plated in a rush due to the wait I'm assuming.  I had the classic eggs Benedict and it was OK. The eggs were not cooked well, the white was still runny and pretty unappealing. I didn't eat much of the egg due to that - the hollandaise was bitter and thin, again, not very appealing. The potatoes were listed as \"parmesan & rosemary\" but as you can see from the picture...they were just unseasoned potatoes. Overall, not very impressive - especially after waiting over an hour.",

Once, it took so long for someone to come over to our table. We noticed tables who sat after us getting their food before our server came by. The next attempt, my wife's food came out and my line took so long that we just shared hers. When they brought mine it was the wrong dish. They offered to make the right one, but by that point we were just ready to leave. Last attempt, I had some of the soupiest grits I've ever seen. I also though that the eggs looked super underdone, the whites were watery. I pointed it out to the server but he said he thought it looked fine. I ended up being sick on the way home.

    "text": "This place is so a** backwards lol. I don't even know where to start.   First we arrive around noonish and of course there was a good crowd. We asked the hostess how long was the wait and she told us 30-40 minutes however the \"Bar Tops\" were first come first serve. We entered the bar area and found an open \"bar top\" for us to sit.   Our waitress greets us noticing that we didn't have menus and went to grab some from the host stand. Upon her return she informs us that the \"bar\" is first come first serve and that the \"bar tops\" are not but it's a common mistake so we were fine.   Anyway...  We proceeded to look at the menu and everything seemed so heavy. I asked her what were they best known for to which she replied their fried chicken. So I ordered their fried chicken sandwich and a side salad. My mom ordered a burger with a side of chicken chili and a bottle of wine for us to share. The chicken sandwich was the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had. I would've been better off going to chick Fil a. It had no seasoning what so over. I had to drown it in honey hot sauce just to get threw my meal. My moms chicken chili had no chicken in it. It was just a bowl of chili sauce and cheese. Our waitress took it back for a replacement only to return saying the chef blended it up so you couldn't see the actual chicken. Lol. We were so over it. We just closed out our check and left.",

Its relatively inexpensive.  Whats not: Food was only so so for all of the people I went with. Our service was spotty - the guy didnt write down our order and messed it up AND I gave him too much cash and he assumed it was his tip. He didnt even bring anything back. He did not deserve a tip after this!",

Starting with the decor, then including the hostess staff, our server (Alicia), the promptness of the service, the complementary (& delicious) biscuits with their own Tupelo Honey, and culminating with the Southwestern Omelet (chorizo, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa, sour cream), I wish I could award them more than five stars. I have dined here fairly often over the past few years, although this was the first time I've been there for brunch; it won't be the last. The Southwestern Omelet is THE BEST omelet I have EVER eaten, omletes are my \"go to\" for breakfast. BTW: It is served with potato cracklings, but since I am keto so told the server to hold them. She graciously offered several options, and the sliced tomatoes fit the bill perfectly.    My sister built her breakfast of scrambled eggs, pancakes and bacon from the Breakfast Combo menu. Although her bacon was a little less-done than she prefers, Alicia promptly had it replaced and cooked to perfection. Sis said everything was delicious. We asked for a \"to go\" box for the extra biscuit (since I didn't eat mine) and Alicia brought a bag with a couple MORE biscuits and some of their blueberry jam.   A great morning, sharing a scrumptious brunch with my wonderful sister! Thanks Tupelo Honey & Alicia!",

Only drawback is they don't normally take reservations but the wait hasn't been too long past 20 minutes anytime I've gone.

    "text": "We were craving Cracker Barrel, but the closest one is by the airport and last time we went to that location my wife broke one of the rocking chairs. We looked for a similar option, and thought of Tupelo Honey. We had heard great things about their brunch, but it was already 8:00 pm so we decided to go for dinner instead.  Parking was available but not convenient, and when we realized we had to climb stairs we almost just walked to Nan and Byrons. Nonetheless, we ended up sticking with the original plan and before we knew it the two of us were sitting at a table with four chairs (all of the booths were occupied).   Did our waitress know the menu? Yes.  Could she pair drinks with dishes? Yes, but only because the menu did it for her. I looked at the beer menu, and nothing really caught my attention, so I asked for a tap water, lite on the ice with an orange slice. My wife asked for the same, and the waitress was back momentarily with two waters, each containing 3 ice cubes and an orange slice and a plate of biscuits with a delicious honey spread.    Took a glance at the appetizers, and nothing was appealing.  We love fried red tomatoes, and order them whenever we can.  However, we DO NOT eat tomatoes before they are ripe. That ruled out the fried green tomatoes.  The Appalachian Shrimp were tempting, but we decided against them as we had never tried fresh water shrimp before. We asked the waitress for her recommended entrees, and she described the Carolina Mountain Trout.  We had been eyeing this item before, but her description made it sound TERRIBLE.  We almost left, but it was already 8:40 and Nan and Byrons seemed like quite the hike.  After another quick glance at the menu, I ordered two Fried Chicken and Biscuits plates before the waitress could ruin them for us.  We already knew we liked the restaurant's biscuits, and we figured its pretty difficult to mess up fried chicken.  We were right! The chicken was very above average, as was the gravy that accompanied it.  There were ups and downs during our visit to Tupelo Honey, but chicken and biscuits were delectable.",

We arrived at 5, parking is to say the least difficult.  At 5pm we were told it was an hour wait. So I spotted two seats at the bar and snagged them. I asked the bartender if we could eat there and she told us yes.  I ordered the tupelo honey draft, which was great.  Since I was sitting at the bar you would think the service would be great... Not so. She couldn't be bothered with us when I asked what was the best thing on the menu.. She simply said it's all good..(I don't think she's even eaten the food here) we ordered the okra to start. The okra came out pretty fast. I love fried okra, however this was wormy tasting mushy and not at all crisp on the inside. Fail. Won't try it again. Since it was so bland I was hesitant to order dinner and we thought about going some place else. It was filling up in the place the bar barely had standing room, and people were pushing and shoving. Some man came over and asked me if the seat next to me was taken and I said no he proceeded to shove another seat in next to me. If you've been there the bar area itself is small, an extra seat doesn't fit well.  Then the man asked to try my okra! Sure since I was done with it now.. And still waiting to order. Weird.     We got veggie plate and tomato soup and grill cheese. When it finally came, it looked ok. The grill cheese is just grilled cheese on big toast. Bland at best. The tomato soup was barely warm, no worries though because the five people tending bar couldn't be bothered to even ask. The veggie plate with Mac and cheeses, beets, and some kind of roasted collard greens was absolutely nasty. The beets were not cooked. Think raw beet dipped in some kind of vinegar sweet juice.. The collards were terrible not even cooked. And I didn't bother tasting the Mac and cheese.  My husband said it was ok. But if your in this area of town looking for southern food I suggest skip this over rated place and head to midnight dinner or macs speed shop. Unless of course you just want beer and crowds.   On one other note the guys next to us asked for a couple shots the bartender lady said well this isn't really a bar bar, if you want that you need find just a bar.. Indicating she had no clue how to mix this shot they wanted which was just pickle juice and Irish whiskey.. Seriously not hard and all she had to do was google it which they did for her.   I'm not going to bother going back here. The service was sub par, the food was worse. Try it if you want to wait 1 hr or more at any time of day and want just say you've been to the new hip trendy place in town. Cheers.",

I could never have pictured a more perfect combination of fresh pico, stone ground goat cheese grits, black eyed peas, peppered bacon and a fried egg on top. Our server William is a rockstar. He made our experience even that more enjoyable. He was full of suggestions and a great sense of humor. ;) We have both grown up in Charlotte and this is by far one of the best restaurants we have ever ate it. This is going to be one of my go-to's. With so many creative food options you are sure to never be bored. And how sweet to enjoy this delicious weather on their cool patio. Love, love, love!!!",

The two of us were promptly seated in a booth for two in the far away corner of the restaurant, near the kitchen.  We joked \"who did we piss off to get such a 'crappy' table?\"  Well, along came our waiter William, and he brightened up that dim little corner!  He was relaxed and not pushy when we were slow in deciding what to order.  There were SO many choices.  We started out with drinks - my friend got the Bloody Mary, it arrived looking like a salad complete with an okra, pepper, olive, celery(of course) lime and a strip of bacon!!!  I ordered the Tupelo Margarita - very nice.  While we waited for our meals, William brought out warm, fresh biscuits with blackberries and of course Tupelo Honey.  Our food arrived and did not disappoint, per Williams suggestion we shared a banana pudding for desert.  Get the banana pudding!!  It will make your tongue want to slap your teeth- SO GOOD!!   Noise level in restaurant was above average, good for a casual meal, \"cool\" location and friendly staff",

Charming, well informed, and truly cared about us enjoying our dining time there...We started with the fried brussel sprouts ( heavenly!) and had the fried green tomato BLT with pimento cheese AND the wicked fried chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese... OMG, Butter my butt and call me a biscuit!! DIVINE! And speaking of biscuits...They wrote the book!! Had two as an appetizer with Tupelo Honey and blueberry compote, as well as enveloping my fried chicken. AND, we were completely blown away  by being gifted with 1. A Tupelo Honey Cookbook 2. A jar of their Blueberry compote 3. And a bowl of the BEST banana pudding I have EVER had! ( Sorry, Mom!) Honestly, we left the place with huge smiles on our face and  completely satisfied palates...Had an amazing lunch. Sam and ALL of the staff were exceptionally gracious and made us feel incredibly welcomed and valued as customers...We will definitely be returning and be bringing friends to partake of the wonderful food and service as well. Can't say enough good things about the place!!! :)",

My mom and I both ordered the shrimp & grits, and she loaded hers with the extra suggestions (ridiculously cheap for the extras, about 45 cents each for bacon spinach etc.!) I must say the Shrimp & Grits were the best I'd ever had, even better than my moms!! The service was also remarkable, the server never let my sweet tea empty out before she refilled it.

We even told him the food was not to our liking and he just ignored it.   My wife had a veggie bowl, which turned out to be 50% fried okra.  I had the chicken and biscuits which was covered in obnoxiously long wide strips of fresh basil; overpowering the entire dish.  Once I took that off, I don't know if my taste buds were so tainted I could not enjoy the remaining favors or if there were not any other favors.  Not a good experience all around.",

    "text": "I have no idea why THC has 3.5 stars. I'd like to think of this review as 4.5.  Let me preface this with the disclaimer: THC is pretty expensive. There's a lot of reasons why - it's a chain from asheville, they're in south end, etc. But they also serve some pretty amazing food so I'd still consider it worth it.  I've been to THC 3 times, and I consider that enough to be able to rate its consistency. Portion sizes are generous, the biscuits + blueberries are TO DIE FOR, and the menu has a solid mix of old and new. Some notes on tastes for those who are wondering what to order:  * The greens are heavy on the soy, and are kale rather than traditional southern choices like mustard or collards. I enjoyed them but I consider them a poor departure from tradition. Lola's greens are far superior * The grits use goat cheese. Of course it says this on the menu but if you're used to gouda in your grits keep it in mind. Personally I'm going to put goat in my next batch if I get a chance. * The nut chicken is supposedly a fan favorite but when their traditional batter is so incredibly fantastic I don't see why you'd do it. * The meatloaf was recommended to me over the chicken piccata which was a disappointment. Personally I think there could be a lot more here - the mushroom gravy used on other dishes would go MUCH better with it than the watery tomato one they throw on. * Get the chicken piccata. Seriously. Don't ask, just do it.  Service has been excellent so far. We had one hiccup with an incredibly long serving time for their top-of-the-line margarita. Turns out they were short staffed at the bar and our server had to cut some of the vegetables. Plus it was missing the shrimp it was supposed to have : (  When I get the check I always sigh a little because I have to tip at least 20% on top of a $35+ tab (poor me right?) but then I sign it anyway because THC is a great place to go for high end southern.",

I've always loved going to Tupelo Honey when I was in Asheville & having those biscuits & blueberry jam in my backyard made my day! Visiting for the first time, I was so happy to see the warm yellow walls that were so familiar at their other restaurants...the decor is so welcoming & comfy cozy...I love it! And the food...wow the food. The biscuits & jam (I know I already mentioned those but they are worth mentioning twice), the fried okra, pimento cheese, shrimp & grits...those are a few of my favorites. And, if you're in the mood for breakfast, you will definitely find something you like. The service is wonderful as well. Tupelo Honey is great for a date night, family & friends dinner and even a business dinner...I've been there for all of those occasions & had a great dining experience each & every time.",

Now onto the food, I ordered the pancake with friend chicken and my husband ordered the southern poutine scramble and the Queen bloody mary (wish I could've drank it!)

Our waiter was very courteous, attentive and informative and we found that be True of all the staff encountered.  We started with Mega Mimosas and a Bloody Mary which everyone enjoyed and got the Fried Green Tomatoes over Goat Cheese Grits as a starter. This was REALLY good, the only thing was that there were only 4 very small slices of tomato. I've never seen such a small green tomato but since we had our breakfasts still to come, it wasn't a big deal. The goat cheese grits were AMAZING though. I love goat cheese and grits and found these to be delicious! They put a lot of basil shreds on top which they could put a little less of but it's a nice flavor with the goat cheese. I just pulled some off.  My mom ordered the \"Samlette\", or omelette with salmon inside which she said she enjoyed, but wished the salmon inside was warm, as it was room temp to cool. I ordered over medium eggs one of which came out that way and the other was over easy but still good. They bacon was sort of fatty which I don't really like so next time I'll be sure to order extra crispy. We all really loved the biscuit with blueberry jam they give each person and we all left super stuffed and happy!  Over all it seemed a little pricey for what we got, but still a good meal and we would all return :)",

Their deck looks amazing... if it had been a little warmer we definitely would have sat outside. Wait was about 20 minutes when we went at 10:45. Food was fantastic! Large portion sizes but with the ambiance of a classy small portion size type place. Free coffee refills made up for the steep price-- over $3 for a cup but the coffee was VERY good. Our server was knowledgeable, courteous, and quick once we were seated. I got the wicked chicken sandwich, which was delicious-- the honey masked the kick of the hot sauce. Crispy potatoes were very interesting but good. I definitely recommend going here!",

I have managed to never wait in line as I always get there early enough or there happens to be room in the bar area, which is very nice. Im sure if I had to wait in the line I see stack up at this place, I wouldn't be as happy. To me, waking up early and rushing out the door for TH is worth it!   I have tried several different breakfast, lunch, and dinner options and I have always been impressed! I love (LOVE) their breakfast fried chicken and biscuits. In fact, it might be some of my most favorite fried chicken in Charlotte - and I've tried a lot of friend chicken in Charlotte. Some other things I love are their home fries, the huuuge plate sized sweet potato pancakes, the breakfast pies, eggs betty, their burger, and basically everything else on the menu.   I have yet to be disappointed by the food or the staff. Tupelo can continue to expect to see me there very often, appetite in tow.",

I ordered the Tupelo Shrimp and Grits which met my every expectation. There was a deliciously smokey spicy oily sauce on top of the grits that the shrimp and peppers had been pan fried in. I added the spicy chorizo for $3 which just took it to the next level.   Absolutely drool worthy and I'll be remembering it for ages.",

    "text": "I went here for dinner with some friends one evening and was surprised by how expensive most of the menu items were. Luckily, we got there during happy hour, so we could order small plates for $5-7. Although the waiter told us we couldn't, we ended up getting to. Score. Note: even though it says happy hour ends at 7, the drink specials are all day.  The mini veggie burger and french fries were delicious, minus the gross onion on the burger. The fried green tomatoes came on top of some sort of paste-like side which I absolutely couldn't stomach. I had high hopes for those tomatoes, but one of my friends ate them instead.   The cosmopolitan I ordered was yummy, although so much stronger the second time I could hardly drink it. Our waiter tried to carry too many things at once and ended up pouring a martini all over my friend before the glass shattered on the floor. Yikes. His knowledge of the menu was so unimpressive I had to ask if he was new. He wasn't.  The second time I came to Tupelo, I took a drink suggestion from our waiter... big mistake. He told me his favorite drink, the blueberry mule, and insisted I'd like it. So wrong! I was sick after one sip. It tasted like a frat guy had made it, not a bartender. He did not treat me very nicely after I told him I did not like the drink and asked for another one. In fact, he never came back to our table after that comment. Another waitress cashed us out, who said, \"happy now??\" once she got our checks right after mixing them up and having to reprint them with the correct orders. Didn't appreciate the 'tude.  The service was incredibly slow both times I have eaten here. I had to flag someone down for more water at least 3 times. Which is mind boggling because there were barely any other patrons eating at the time. The staff is rarely ever friendly or knowledgeable, which is kind of a not-so-cool thing at a restaurant.  Hire some new staff, make sure they study the menu, and check on that bartender...",

    "text": "One of my all time favorite places in Charlotte, North Carolina. Tupelo Honey Cafe is the right pick when looking for that old southern comfort food. The best way to get there is by Light Rail, if you can get on the Lynx and take it to the South End of Charlotte. It is right off of the stop! You wont be able to miss it because the smell of yummy food immediately hits you when you get off the train. I have now been their two times, one time for brunch and one time to dinner. a majority of the pictures are from their dinner. During every meal they give you homemade biscuits, Tupelo honey, and their homemade blueberry jam. The Ribs and the Corn Souffle are probably by far the best! The meat was so tinder that it just fell off the bone. The Corn Souffle melted in your mouth. They put their Mac and Cheese in a tiny skillet, I LOVE this because it keeps it warm while you eat. I also 100% suggest anything with their fried chicken. The chicken is so tinder and delicious. Be prepared to eat a lot... But I guarantee you won't leave unhappy!",

I came on business because the reviews were great, and this place didn't disappoint.  The happy hour menu is pretty extensive-I tried the fried green tomatoes (amazing), and the shrimp taco (you'll probably want to order 2, as there's only one per order-especially if it's dinner for you).  I also tried their lemon mint martini-didn't love it (it's made with moonshine, so it was a bit strong), but then I got a raspberry ginger one, and that was a bit better.  Best part is at the start-they give you a biscuit with honey and blueberry jam-all 3 things from scratch-so cute!",

They gave everyone one biscuit to start with and some of their signature honey and jam. I wish they offered us more biscuits or just brought out a basket.   I ordered the fried chicken with a side of their mac n cheese.  It also came with some of their Kale slaw.   The fried chicken was juicy and yummy but they didn't do the skin right. It fell off the chicken as soon as you cut into it. The mac n cheese had a little bit of a kick to it but overall it was creamy and delicious. The Kale slaw was a fail. It didn't have a lot of flavor to it and also it sitting on top of the hot food, so it wilted and had a weird texture.   Overall if I'm paying $20 to eat brunch I want a wow. The food was good but I feel like I've had a lot better for the price range.",

I didn't care too much for the shrimp and grits.. I guess to much it's a little busy.. All the taste get all jumble up.. Maybe I'll give it another try next time.. And as far as our waitress.

They change the menu regularly so if you get something you really like chances are you won't get it again so enjoy it! Good news it whatever they replace it with will be just as good! Their menu is southern inspired and even have goat cheese grits! I'm obsessed with goat cheese so anywhere that has it on the menu is good in my book. Their bloody Mary's are made with jalapeno infused moonshine! Very spicy so beware if that is not your cup of tea. I can't wait to go back for their next menu change to see what other delicious food I can eat!",

They were fried perfectly crispy and definitely flavorful.  I was really surprised how good it tasted!    I also tried the scallops again really really good, the flavor and texture to me was just as good as the scallops at McCormick and Smiths. They were not as big as McCormick and Smith, but just as tasty.  I also had the sweet potato pancakes topped with fried chicken, bacon, butter and syrup:) . I am not a pancake fan, really don't like them to much But these were so good......everyone should try.  If i could change anything about the food it would be to have dark meat instead of white I just don't like white meat and also maybe making a chicken a little bit more salty. (I might only feel that way because of the white meat flavor) Texture of fried chicken was perfect, I just don't understand why they only Cary white meat?? it can't be health reasons,,,,,not when serving with bacon and pancakes",

We made  reservations for 10am and we're seated quickly right next to the expo station and open kitchen window. Service was friendly and consistent. Our waiter didn't leave us waiting for anything. We watched food come up to be taken out to tables while we decided to order. I settled on French toast which was 3 half slices with blueberry compote. I liked my food and ended up needing to take a piece home. I ate way too much between the biscuit and the two pieces. I felt sick on my way home. My husband ordered the Eggs Betty on a biscuit. His eggs were cold which took away from the dish. We weren't surprised our food was not hot as we saw plates come up and sit in the window for a while before being served. The restaurant was busy and there seemed to be tons of wait staff milling around the window but the plates kept piling up. Between our two plates, a side of fries, a coffee and a sweet tea (no alcohol since we weren't there until 12p) we spent around $50 with tip. Pretty hefty but it seemed like some of the plates were huge portions that could've served two. Overall, I wouldn't come back unless I were invited by someone else. I can't imagine if we'd gotten drink and spent $70 on one meal.",

I expected this one to be equally as good, and it was not even comparable.  I ordered the sweet tea chicken and green beans. I asked about the green beans texture and was told they were soft, not crispy at all. I also had the Brussel sprouts. The chicken came out with a nice flavor, but green beans were crisp and not soft at all. When I asked for a replacement of another veggie, the waiter brought me a plate and put it in front of me to ask for the green beans back. Kind of weird - most restaurants just bring out the other side. The Brussel sprouts had an overpowering mustard flavor to them.   My friend's food was served lukewarm.   Wait staff seemed very eager for us to leave although it was not very busy at the time. We didn't bother him too much or ask for much.   All in all, overpriced for taste and value.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I started off with sweet tea and fried green tomatoes. Waitress was sweet and brought us complimentary biscuits and jam. Sweet tea was very yummy. Fried green tomatoes were VERY filling. Would come back for those and a cocktail, which would be plenty enough to fill your belly up. I got the shrimp and grits with chorizo for my lunch. I could only manage to eat a few bites since the app filled me so much. However , those few bites were absolutely delicious. Mouth watering worthy shrimp and grits. On the other hand, the fried chicken was not anything special. That's the reasoning for only 4 stars. Coating was pretty bland and chicken dry. The \"pork belly\" collard greens were more of just collards with no pork belly. Seriously didn't find a single piece in it. Boyfriend was disappointed, but he enjoyed the Mac and cheese. Definitely had lots of cheese in it. The waitress even made him some honey mustard which he loved. Props for that! Will be back for a happy hour to try some of their $4.5 snacks and cocktails while down here in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Looking for a brunch spot for a birthday celebration on MLK day was a little more difficult than me and my friends expected but Tupelo Honey was suggested and was a good choice. I have heard a lot of great things about the restaurant so I was excited to try it out with my girls.   The parking was ok, it is a fairly large parking lot but it was not many spots available. The restaurant was cute and the wait was not long for a group of 7.  The biscuits and jam as an appetizer was good, I enjoyed them! the biscuit was a good cross between soft and crispy, it was buttery and enough to hold me until my entree came.  We all ordered drinks, most of the girls ordered mimosas, I am not a fan of orange juice so I ordered the red sangria and I LOVED IT! It was amazing! I really could've order a pitcher of it if it was possible.  For my entree I order the Shoo Moo pancakes, which is the sweet potatoe pancake with a fried chicken cutlet and bacon on top. It was a big portion, I could only eat about half of it. The dish over all was ok, the chicken was not seasoned to me and the wicked sauce I got on the side did not help or take away from the chicken. The overall conclusion by the group was the food was ok, the drinks were good and the restaurant was nice for a brunch type setting.",

My husband ordered the flat iron steak and it was fair; covered in sauce..  I had the shrimp and grits, and they were cold- 3 shrimp and 2 extra dollars for hard, dry chorizo, not worth it. My daughter had the ribs that were good but nothing special. The margaritas looked promising but were missing the tequila! Biscuits are still good however for a 200 dollar meal, I gotta get something more yummy than biscuits.",

I was a bit disappointed that despite the restaurant being heavily vacant that I was subject to wait 30 minutes for a table and more so thereafter for service. I can understand that restaurants and servers aren't fully staffed at that time vs 11AM, but it wasn't like the restaurant was closed or about to be closed.  Anyways I digress, I ordered the Avocado toast and was very pleased with the portion sizes. Everything tasted very fresh and flavorful. The location gets a lot of natural sunlight, so it's great for picture taking. The presentation was spot on.  Price-wise, the meals were right on the nose for about what you get. It's around what you expect to pay for brunch with portions around what you get.   Great place if you can get a spot and don't mind exorbitant wait times.",

Pros: biscuits served with fresh jam, and the mega mimosas were fabulous.  Our server, Carrie was kind, too.  Cons: hair in food.  I ordered the smoked salmon with goat cheese grits.  The grits were actually a fried grit cake/patty, which was cool - until I cut into it.  After the second bite, I unfortunately found two long black hairs (not mine) tangled in the grit cake.  Server was apologetic, and brought out a different dish within minutes. My second meal was the chicken and biscuits.  It was tasty, but I had pretty much lost my appetite by then.  This place has potential. Perhaps the kitchen staff needs a refresher course on health, safety and sanitation policies.",

A nice young lady at the front took our name for the wait and she was so friendly, and ya'll it is WORTH THE WAIT.  After I got sat down at my little table I was browsing over the drink menu and our server Holiday quickly arrived and thank god she did! I was lost in the sauce with all the choices and she quickly and easily guided me around and told me about their award winning bloody mary's! BEST IN CHARLOTTE YALL. Then we had the biscuits. And let me tell you Im going to  thank god in church next Sunday for those biscuits because they are HEAVEEEN. We ordered another round after the first! Holliday was telling me about their SHOO MERCY PANCAKES and they held up to her hype!!

It was a super huge serving and I was excited. If you love fried okra, well you have hit the jackpot because it was good. The biscuits that come out are so good and fluffy! The warm honey and yummy preserves were awesome as well. I killed that biscuit! We both got the southern chicken piccata with jumbo shrimp and lemon cherry pepper cilantro beurre blanc. And OMG the sauce was excellent. I could have eaten another serving of that! The entree was very tasty and had lots of flavor.   The drinks were very unique and different as well. I had a drink called \"cool as a cucumber\" and it packed a nice lil punch. And my friend had \"blueberry fields forever\" and it was good too.

Watched a server tear up bacon apart with his hands (at the bar) and then dump it into some kind pickle jar with cloudy water or liquor. It was pretty nasty to see while we ate. Isn't that what the kitchen is for? Prepping?!!! 3. Witnessed a customer come up to the bar and get ignored. Then she was acknowledged by the bartender, only to be told to wait. After 10 minutes that customer just left. I don't blame her. 4. We had to go he out own condiments from another table across the room. 5. Saw new customers come sit in the bar area. After waiting about 15 minutes, they decided I go get their own menus.   It's pretty sad, cause the food there really was good. But the service is killing it.  That will be my first and last time at this place. I can't wait to complain about it at work on Monday.",

    "text": "My husband brought me here for my birthday the end of August. Let me start by saying that you know that you can have fantastic food, but poor wait staff service and I will never return to your establishment. I know this is True for me and what's also True is that I may be the most analytical person alive.  Now let's get to the review for TUPELO HONEY and EMERSON! If you've been here you know their food is delicious. It's a southern twist with a beautiful ambience. We would have dined outside, but it was raining so we opted to dine in. We started with the Pimento Cheese Nachos as an appetizer. They were seasoned to perfection and were so delicious. While waiting on the appetizer, Emerson brought out some biscuits and blueberry preserves!  The biscuits were good but the preserves, all I can say is Shoo Mercy( when you visit you be saying the same thing). For our main course, we had Shoo Mercy Shrimp And Grits and Shoo Mercy Pancakes. It's was amazing! The Shoo Mercy Shrimp and Grits was recommended by our waiter. And he was right, it made me say Shoo Mercy! Lol the Shoo Mercy Pancakes was one of his recommendations as well, it had potato pancakes and southern fried chicken. Such an amazing combination. Shoo Mercy, once again!  Now, what really made our experience so unforgettable was our waiter, EMERSON! This guy gets 5 STARS. He was knowledgable from the menu selection to the history of \"Shoo Mercy\".  Most of all he had energy and made us feel like it was his pleasure to make our dinning experience pleasurable. It was my birthday dinner and although he wasn't aware,  he made my birthday dinner one that will never be forgotten. His customer service and just his attentiveness was unprecedented for that level of dining. You would expect his customer service level at maybe The Fig Tree Restaurant. We will return and will definitely ask to be seated in Emerson's area. Thanks Emerson!",

    "text": "Good food, darned expensive. I waited several months before trying Tupelo Honey. I heard the lines were long so I figured I'd give the newness some time to wear off. Looks like it has because we walked right in at 7:30 on a Friday night.  Granted...we didn't ask for the patio...which looked very inviting on a nice, cool, summer evening.  Service was attentive although a bit uninformed.  My other half asked for mac and cheese instead of asparagus and she said the substitution wasn't possible, yet returned a few minutes later to say it was.  That's a training issue though.  Food was really good.  I got the veggie melt which included layers of fried green tomatoes (which managed to retain their crunch), lemon aioli, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  It was served open faced, making it much easier to manage. I chose the browned butter brussels sprouts as my side. More butter than I would have liked and they were a bit under seasoned but tasty, nonetheless.  Other half ordered the chicken piccata. I've never seen chicken piccata with shrimp, much less without capers, but it must have been good because he completely cleaned his plate.  Oh...and the biscuits! Yummy! And served with honey (naturally) and blueberry jelly. I'd come back just for those!  My only problem was the pricing. The chicken piccata was 18 bucks! But...like I said, he cleaned that plate so I suppose it was worth it.  Maybe next time I'll hit the patio and do some people watching!  I'll definitely come back. Maybe nex",

    "text": "I have to say I was a little disappointed, since all the reviews show this place to be \"the place to be\"!  We made a reservation because it's always packed. Today, of course it wasn't. We were seated immediately. The atmosphere is quaint and cozy. Our server was a doll. She was new. We ordered a mimosa and a beer. She brought us out coffee and the drinks took a little longer than I would've expected for just drinks. They put fresh, hot biscuits for each on your table with blueberry preserves. The biscuits were scrumptious! If you like goat cheese, every fuckin thing here  has it in it. I, of course I  am the odd ball who doesn't. They don't sub it out because it's already made with it. However, she brought me a little to try and it was actually very subtle, warm and creamy . Quite good, I must admit.I ordered Eggs Betty (Benedict) and Frank ordered a \"Scrambled Bowl\". It looked liked eggs scrambled with Caramelized  onions, cheddar, bacon, and \"potato cracklings\".  They're potatoes that are baked, smashed, seasoned and pretty good.  It came with toast that was only toasted on one side. My guess is that they're \"toasted\" on a flat top griddle and it tasted like it. My eggs were perfectly cooked, on top of a biscuit with a thick slice of bacon that I found to be a little tough and dry. Oh and my food was COLD. I sent it back and it was taken off the bill. Manager came over, apologized, and gave us a jar of strawberry preserves on him. Overall, it was a great experience and we definitely will try it again. I know this place didn't get great reviews for nothing . WE WILL BE BACK, TUPELO! Get ready!",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  We had a chance to try Tupelo Honey for breakfast one Saturday, and here a few early observations:  - Pewter Rose's former location has lost a bit of its former charm with TH's reconfiguration.  Tables are fitted closely together in the former bar area, and it's pretty noisy when full.  We can't wait to try dining outside when it gets warmer, where it's more comfortable and likely less noisy.  - They now have an elevator for easier accessibility to the second floor.  How awesome is that?! - The biscuits with homemade blueberry jam you get before your meal are the best we've ever had.  We'll have to try them with gravy the next time! - Their menu has plenty of options, and they'll even allow some substitutions for picky eaters.  For example, goat cheese grits are one of their sides, but you can substitute plain grits or any other cheese in your grits (such as cheddar or havarti). - Their \"meat pies\" are delicious little quiches with loads of flavor.  I just wish there were more options than just one version each of their meat and veggie pies.  Plus, the meat one has cheese, but the veggie one does not.   - Prices are a bit on the high end for breakfast.  For example, both of our entrees (meat pie and breakfast bowl) were $9.95.  - Their coffee is also expensive and could be much stronger!  Or, at least offer espresso as an option. - Our server was just super - friendly, helpful, and attentive.  We hope that's a sign of the quality of their wait staff!   TH competes well against Zada Jane's for breakfast, with the exception of their worse than average coffee.  We'll definitely be back, just not as frequently as we dine at Zada's.",

    "text": "Get it together, THC Charlotte. I know you've only been open for two weeks, so I should cut you some slack. But i'm not sure, after my experience this week, I can justify visiting you again.   I walked in at 4:45 on Monday afternoon, ravenous and ready to indulge. There was one table occupied, and approximately 17 servers standing around joking with each other.  I was supposed to be meeting my sister, who was stuck in traffic, but I thought I'd go ahead and order a drink and appetizer while I waited for her. NO CAN DO. The hostesses informed me that 75% of my party needed to be there before I could be seated. Incredulous, I took a slow look around the restaurant recognizing that there were approximately 12 servers per person currently dining. Sensing my annoyance, the hostess laughed and said \"I know it seems silly but that's our rule.\"  I understand that rule. I'm actually for that rule. WHEN IT MAKES SENSE. Does it really make sense to annoy the third person to patronize your establishment that evening?  Get a grip, THC. Rules make the world work, but please teach your employees some common sense in applying those rules.   After awkwardly standing in the foyer looking at the nearly empty restaurant for five minutes, a manager finally came over and allowed me to be seated. From this point forward, the service was excellent. Our waiter was the perfect mix of attentive but not annoying. When my meal turned out not to be up to the THC Asheville standard, the manager insisted on trying to make it again but better this time, and I appreciated the effort.  The PIMM'S CUP, made with Pimm's (fruit infused gin), cucumber, and ginger ale, was delicious and refreshing. The food, however was a big disappointment.   FRIED GREEN TOMATO appetizer - the cornmeal breading was crunchy but otherwise lacked flavor, and the goat cheese grits smelled of goat cheese more than tasted.  With no other sauce or flavor, these ended up being dry and bland. I'm usually a big fan of fried green tomatoes, but if the breading is not delicious on its own, the dish really needs some remoulade sauce or chunks of goat cheese to make up for it. 1/5  MISSE'S ASHEVILLE'S VEGGIE MELT - I've had this three times at the Asheville location and enjoyed it, to varying degrees, every time.  This time the bread was soggy and lacked any sourdough flavor, and the cooks were a little heavy-handed with the Havarti cheese melted on top. The crunch of the fried green tomato was completely lacking, so the entire sandwich felt like a big pile of mushy soggy limp vegetables with no textural differences at all. The lemon aoli is amazing. Really. It is! That's one of the main reasons I keep ordering this dish. Unfortunately that alone could not save this sandwich. 0/5  CHEESY CAULIFLOWER BISQUE - nothing memorable, other than that it wasn't good enough to eat more than a few spoonfuls. The biscuit croutons were definitely a nice touch. But the soup lacked flavor. 0/5  TOMATO SOUP-  unfortunately, same review as above. The croutons were nice, but the soup itself lacked flavor and wasn't good enough to waste stomach space. 1/5  SHOO GRILLED CHEESE - grilled cheese sandwich with fried green tomatoes, sauteed veggies, bacon and hot, melty pimento cheese. What's not to like? This was the one item that seemed good; unfortunately it was my sister's. 4/5  FRIED OKRA with CAROLINA WHITE SAUCE - the okra was fine. Nicely crispy. But the white sauce... Not. Good. At. All. Ask for the lemon aoli to dip the okra in; it's much better. 2.5/5  The location, in the old Pewter Rose, is great, and I love the outdoor seating. That will be great when the weather is a little better. The restaurant and bar areas are both very large and will accommodate quite a crowd, even more so than the Asheville location.",

    "text": "Ok, Ok, I give in.  I'm a fan, I'm a follower, I'm a kool-aide drinker, I'm pathetically ALL about this place.  I was secretly hoping I didn't like it so I could go against the hype and put a spotlight on the truth of this place BUT the truth is...it was a very good experience.  Right off the bat I can tell you I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the ambiance.  It was loud and chaotic on Friday night.  I think the exposed kitchen only added clinking and clanging to the already hollowed out echoing that was taking place in the main dining area.  It was so loud that I was literally having to strain to talk to the people at my table.  Regarding the food... Everything that came out was done sensationally!  Of course we started with the biscuits, which are served with honey (no surprise there) and a blueberry jam.  These biscuits were absolutely heavenly.  They are the kind of biscuits that make other biscuits jealous.  I mean, FORGET Flying Biscuit, Bojangles, Biscuitville, and wherever else you may get a fresh biscuit.  THC has got to be serving the best or close to it!  They were buttery, flaky, warm, soft, yet crispy on the outside.    I ordered the veggie plate and bumped up to 4 veggies for $12.95.  I tried the asparagus, cheesey cauliflower rice, mashed sweet potatoes and brown butter brussel sprouts.  They accidentally brought out the homemade mac and cheese as well.  This platter was the most comforting veggie plate I have ever had.  The mashed sweet potatoes were my favorite.  They were pleasantly flavored with just enough brown sugar to balance the other savory items I selected.  My next favorite dish was the brown butter brussel sprouts.  They were cooked to a tender perfection, they were seasoned just enough and the butter balanced the normal bitter taste of the sprouts.  Next up would be the cheesy cauliflower rice.  I make cauliflower rice at home but nothing like this!  This was a great mix between mashed potatoes au gratin and cheesy grits.  The texture was obviously more \"rice-like\" but the flavor was very rich and again soothing/comforting.  Lastly, I tried the asparagus.  They were my least favorite but still rather tasty.  They were covered in benne seeds but just didn't have much flavor.  They were crispy and warm, which was good but I would have preferred some other type of flavoring.    Others at my table enjoyed the Meatloaf which was rosemary infused, tender and bursting with flavor!  Her meal was served with the mac n cheese which was very good--creamy (not gummy) and had a nice spice to it (not bland).  Another person ordered the grilled cheese that is served with creamy tomato soup.  At first I thought that was ridiculous to order but then I realized this was a grilled cheese on steroids and absolutely worth ordering!  It was served on toasted sourdough bread, had bacon on it, fried green tomatoes AND pimento cheese all united in a very holy matrimony.  It was brilliant.  I'm sure they are still working out a few kinks but they really served up a great meal.  I knew their brunch would be good but I didn't know what to expect regarding dinner and I left 100% satisfied.  The service was decent but I think it could be better and will get better over time.  The servers seemed to be running ragged and they seem a little short staffed in general.  The manager did approach the table which I always enjoy but everyone just seemed a little frazzled.    Obviously I wouldn't advise going here for a romantic dinner but this place is better for a group of friends or a casual date.  I saw one too many kids so that puts a damper on a low key date night in my opinion.  Go for the food and you won't be disappointed.  I think the initials for this restaurant are really a subliminal message....\"THC\"...because the food is euphoric.  :)  Enjoy!",

Love, Love, Love! After I ate one and stared at the remainder planning my next attack, my breakfast pizza was delivered.  The pizza was super good.  I was expecting the eggs to be cooked in the pizza, but instead they are placed on the pizza like a topping. Nevertheless, it tasted very good. Definitely enjoyed the brunch and will be brunching, lunching, or dinnering here again.",

Our party of four could not have been happier with our evening or more thrilled that they're now in our backyard!  Our favorites? Of course, the incredible biscuits with blueberry spread and honey, Appalachian Egg Rolls (amazing BBQ pork egg rolls), Fried Green Tomatoes, Shoo-mercy Shrimp and Grits, Chicken Saltimbocca and Grilled Cheese (cheddar and havarti, please!) with fantastic Tomato Bisque. You'll want to go back again and again!  Everything you love about the Asheville locations will now be a shining star in Charlotte! If you've never been, by all means GET THERE!! Delicious food and attentive, friendly staff. What more do you need?!?",

    "text": "I had a really bad experience during a recent visit to Tupelo Honey.  We had a group of 6, with no reservation, so I knew there would be a wait.  The hostess said it would be 35-40 minutes.  No big deal.  We grabbed a drink and a seat outside to wait it out.  After about 45 minutes, we went to check on the table and the hostess said it would be another 35-40 minutes.  What?! How do you misjudge the timing by half??  Since we had already invested that much time in it, we decided to wait it out.  After about 45 more minutes, we were finally sitting down at our table.  Then the wait only continued.  Our server was not very friendly and not in any hurry.  We ordered an appetizer of chips and pimento cheese.  It took about 15 minutes to finally get that appetizer.  That's right, 15 minutes to melt some cheese and put it on a plate with chips and get it to our table.  Ridiculous.  Luckily it didn't take that long to get the food, but unfortunately a couple of the plates had the wrong sides, which had to be corrected.    If it wasn't for the fact that the food was actually pretty good and those darn biscuits are good enough to eat a dozen, Tupelo wouldn't have even gotten 3 stars.  I'm going to try it out again and hope for a little better experience.  If that doesn't happen, I probably won't go back...except to maybe pick up a few biscuits on carry out.",

After waiting for around 10 mins to be helped, we were informed that our waiter did not know that he had a table. Since we had a enough time to decide what we wanted to eat, when we ordered they realized they had given us the brunch menu instead of the dinner menu. After ordering, we we're sitting in full view of the open kitchen and saw a man with the words \"chef\" on his hat, using a cell phone with gloves on and did not see him change his gloves before handling the food. We also observed that our entrees sat under the lamps on the counter for a while before they were brought out to us. But that's not all, they also only brought our main dish without the side and we were able to finish our sandwich before our side even reached the table. Although they comped our half price appetizer for making us wait, this still did not make up for our poor experience. Plus, we were maybe one of five tables in the dining room (the kitchen should not have been that behind) The food was delicious as always, but there is lots of room for improvement for service.",

I'm sure this restaurant was once great, hence the high star rating, and why I had bookmarked it. But, what it was is no longer what it is....at least not on the evening we went. To be fair, the biscuits are yummy and the fried green tomatoes are delicious.  But the entrees we ordered were not good- greasy and tasteless.

Fried green tomatoes that find the difficult sweet spot between toothsome and mushy with a batter that clings on for dear life allowing one to enjoy both the crisp crunch and buttery softness that the treat should provide. Set atop of a bed of grits, the red pepper coulis adds brightness and interest to a dish that begs for a spatula scrape or a brownie spoon lick at the end.   The sweet potato pancake, if just a tad bit on the dryer side, is accompanied by near perfectly cooked fried chicken and a maple pepper bacon that adds to the complexity to the dish.   The heaping 26 dollar portion of Shoo Fly Shrimp and Grits loads every bite with shrimp, so much so that they I believe this to be the first time I've ever taken home a shrimp dish with shrimp to be had. The spicy mix of peppers and mushrooms flavors the dish well, and I order chorizo on the side expecting crushed or cubed pieces, but instead get large moderately thick slices of the dark red spicy meat.   Pork egg rolls have the appearance of being hastily rolled and are a bit too greasy for my liking. The only thing I would not be back for.   Service is kind and warm. The hostess provides a level of southern charm that starts the meal on a very high note.",

One of us had a veggie Black bean burger which was deep fried, ridiculously greasy and really not very tasty, would have been lovely if just grilled I am sure. Another person in our group had the beef burger, again just far too greasy. Then last person had avocado toast and one poached egg was great, the other Boiled and no good. Service was great so just such a shame the food was so disappointing.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure if this would be much different from the Tupelo Honey in Asheville which I largely disdained in my years of living there, as a tourist spot.  I came here with a party of four for Sunday brunch.  We were seated outside on the patio which was super sunny for half the table.  There was also a rogue and seriously out of tune church bell situation within ear shot.    Our food was just okay especially for the cost (which seemed very high even for Charlotte).  My meal of avocado toast didn't come with all the ingredients described on the menu and not only that, the avocado was almost brown and kind of mushy.  It also came with an egg which was cooked as described but too runny for my taste.  To their credit, the server took it back, no questions asked and they cooked the egg a little firmer for me.  And now I know, that even though \"sunny side up\" sounds really pretty, I'm really an \"over medium\" girl!  The server was helpful and pleasant when we saw her but our table was largely ignored, except by the sun and church bells.",

Lots of window panes and ceiling fans  Team ordered a bit of everything - the True standouts were the Fried Green Tomatoes - thick tomatoes w/ a crunchy thick breading & all sitting on top of a wonderful layer of goat cheese grits, beet salad was super-yummy w/ huge dollops of goat cheese & lots of candied pecans  Others indulged in brussles sprouts - but veggies beware, they're made w/ bacon but the table ended up ordering an extra serving, chicken wings, spicy potato cubes & all out appetizer plates were cleaned, clear  Entrees included Shrimp & grits, Shrimp tacos, Fried Chicken - we ran the southern gamut & it was delish!  Drinkys included a Peach Wheat Ale which was deemed delish as was my Pumpkin Bourbon Mule - nice southern, country spin on the classic Moscow Mule & loved the wintry spices.....served in the classic copper mug of course  Would come back here in a heartbeat!!",

Well wish we didn't our experience was not good at all. Ordered pimento cheese nacho and replaced the chorizo with soysage. When we received dish it looked like real meat so I mentioned it to server she said she would check with chef not to mention took about 20+ mins to receive them. No one ever came back for about 5 more mins and it was the manager who said \"that was soysauge and that they are making us new ones and he will take care of it\" he walked away and I said to my husband if that was the case why didn't they just tell us that and give them back to us??????????? Waited another 15 mins and no nachos or waitress finally we grabbed someone and said don't worry about it we will just pay for our drinks we didn't have time to wait any longer. We were ignored again and about 10 more mins then they finally came out and they handed check to us with nachos in to go containers that took 30-40 mins to get! Need to say we left the nachos there and left the correct amount of our drinks and got into our Uber and left. Uber Plus Nachos Moral of story you may not want to drop in quickly and have a beer and appetizer at bar if you have only 45 mins to spare! Friendly Reminder: Nachos are chips with cold ingredients added to them topped with cheese and put in oven to melt for no more than 5 mins.",

It seems that they are trying to reduce costs which was noticeable when we each got our biscuits and one tiny side of jam to split between the five of us. No knives, ketchup, or honey on the table anymore, those need to be requested separately which was hard to do since the server was busy for Sunday brunch. I normally eat my whole plate and if I don't, I will box it up to eat later. This was not the case with the Gulf Coast Lump Crab Benedict with potatoes. There was hardly any crab, the yolks of the poached eggs were hard and overcooked, the hollandaise sauce lacked flavor, the biscuit was mushy, and the potatoes burnt. My plate was basically untouched. When the server asked if I wanted a box I said no with a disgusted face. She took my full plate away and didn't offer to comp it. She never came back to check to see if our food was okay or fill up on water. I am very disappointed with Tupelo as I think it's a cool atmosphere and the food was one time pretty good.",

    "text": "Service was absolutely awful. It's a shame cause the foods so dang good.   We went Sunday for brunch and were quoted an hour to get seated and after a half hour or so we asked the hostess how much longer she thought it would be and she would only tells us how much time was left on our \"quote\" and would not give us an honest answer like \"there's a few tables ahead of you, ect\". Once we were seated our table was wet and covered in cleaner, and our menus were soaking wet as well. We didn't even receive silverware.   Waitress came over and and got a drink order, looked at our wet table and just left. Came over and dropped of the drinks and looked at us like we're crazy because we had to dry off our table and menus ourselves. When she looked us as like we were crazy we said it was because the table was covered in cleaner and our menus were wet and she said he just cleaned the table and then left. She didn't offer to get us napkins or even dry the table off.   After she dropped off our drinks we noticed our glasses were dirty, both had frosting or cream of some sort all over them. When she came back about 5 mins later with the biscuits we had to ask her for new drinks and showed her the dirty ones and she acted as if it wasn't her problem. Once she returned with the new drinks it wasn't what we ordered and we also had to ask her for silverware.   So as you can imagine our experience was not good to start and keeps getting worse. Our waitress acted like the issues we've had: wet table and menus, dirty glasses, no silverware, ect were a severe inconvenience to her. That being said: she decided to ignore our table from the time she brought our replacement drinks to after we were done eating. She served the tables around us but blatantly ignored us.   We finished our food, which was pretty good, and she walked past our table on 4 occasions with our napkins and silverware on the plates on the edge of the table and wouldn't pick them up. It wasn't until the table behind us was ready to cash out she brought us checks. Once she got our card she went and rang out every other table she had before giving us back our check.   I've been here and had really good food and service but this waitress with the pink hair made what could have been a really pleasant experience absolutely awful. Especially since Tupelo Honey is on the higher end of the price spectrum.",

It can get a little pricey, but the food really is worth it. The parking kinda sucks because it's South End and there are other businesses in the complex, but that's to be expected in Charlotte.

Thankfully, Kimberly asked had I been helped yet, and served our table with excellent customer service. Allie proceeded to help every other table, and never acknowledged us the entire night, until she overheard us ask Kimberly who was the server for our area, which Ally was cleaning the table behind us. I'm not sure if this is acceptable to Tupelo Honey, but clearly she didnt wait on us because we were African Americans. It's a shame that this overshadowed the visit, because I enjoyed my drink, and entree. Thank you to Kimberly, who saved the day, and made us feel welcomed. Her customer service is awesome!",

    "text": "Tupelo has been in our hit list (places to eat lol) for some time due to the numerous positive review. The restaurant is very busy which made it hard for us to make it in. However, we decided to take a chance at brunch. Best decision!  Our wait was no more than 20 min which was understandable. The waiting area is really spacious and comfy. It was a but hectic with a toddler but it helped the waiting area was spacious.   Now let's dive into the good stuff and that is the food.   We started everything with biscuits and homemade berry jam. Now, these biscuits were heavenly, fluffy and just the right amount of flavor. The jam was another game winner.  We proceeded to order fried okra as an appetizer which was a winner. The okra was fresh and crispy with a nice amount of breading. At this point, we were slowing entering food coma.   Our entrees consisted of eggs & steak with oven baked potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes with done just right. Now the real MVP was the sauce (not sure what it was made off).   My wife ordered the shrimp and grits with chorizo. Fair warning the chorizo is very spicy and a bit overwhelming. The shrimp and grits would have been amazing with out the chorizo. The grits were probably one of my favorite items in the menu. They were so creamy and just had a very good consistency.    Our toddler ordered off the kids menu which was another well prepared dish (even though it was for a kid). At this point we were the surprise of quality of food.   Now, let's get to the service and overall experience. Our server and service was exceptional from the start to the end. Our server William did a great job interacting with the table even though he has like 4 other tables. Even though my beer never made it out on time but it was forgotten due to all the other positive experiences.",

    "text": "I'm taking one star off only because it was crowded.  There, now I can get to everything wonderful about this place.  This might take a while.  Setting:  Pewter Rose was a gorgeous location.  And with the redesign, it was only made better.  Lots of natural light, great paint scheme, interesting decor.  Comfy seating.  It all works.    Drink:  Love the focus on local and NC craft brewing.  My Birdsong Jalepeno Pale Ale was perfect.  Food:  Lordy, it is amazing.  Too much to choose from?  \"The menu is almost as big as Cheesecake Factory.\" observed my cohort.  There is a lot, but so much of it looks so good, that it's challenging to pick.  Here's what I went with -  Appetizer - Appalachian Eggrolls.  BBQ in an eggroll.  This shouldn't work.  It seems like something from TGIFriday's.  But dang, take everything that's great about a regular eggroll, and combine that with everything great about good BBQ, and there you go.  Good portion size to share, without being too filling. Main lunch course:  Shoo Grill Cheese.  Havarti and pimento cheese, with ham and maple bacon, and fried green tomatoes on nicely toasted oat bread.  There are no words.  Eating it makes you happy.  So, so very happy. I would be remiss to not mention the complimentary biscuits.  They should be charging for these.  Another cohort, a biscuit afficiando, claimed they were in his top 3.  Price:  Within reason.  Not cheap and not shockingly expensive.  Amazing.  Wondrous.  Pleasant.  Delicious.  Can't wait to go back.",

All their food was well thought out and different while still sticking to tradition. I could hardly decide what to get; I was stuck on three or four options that all sounded delicious (so I'll be going back soon). I ended up getting the loaded grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and a side of grits. I'm so happy I didn't pass on the goat cheese grits- they were fantastic! Overall, I recommend Tupelo Honey Cafe if you're in the mood for good food... So obviously, any time is a good time to go!",

    "text": "If I could give no stars, I would have. We had a reservation for a group of 6 for 7 pm a few weeks after this place opened. When we arrived, only 4 of the 6 were there, so we were sent to the bar to wait. When the other members arrived just a few minutes later, we were told that the wait would be 30 min even though we had a reservations. Fine. Whatever. We had a good place at the very tiny bar. One plus was that the bar service was very prompt and friendly even though it's typically packed shoulder to shoulder.  Thirty minutes came and passed, and when I asked about our reservation, they said 15 more minutes. When I asked after 15 minutes, they said 15 more....This went on for AN HOUR AND A HALF. Why we waited, I'm not really sure. At that point it was probably principle more than anything.  I finally had to stand at the hostess station with the manager for her to figure out they had given a party of TWO with the same name our table over an hour ago and had been trying to save face ever since. Complete idiots never even told me (which I wouldn't have been super understanding, but still, at least it was an excuse). The manager was completely rude and unapologetic for their mistakes.  After much back and forth, we were seated TWO AND A HALF HOURS after we first arrived (which was two hours and 15 minutes after our reservation time). Luckily, our food was comped, but I want my life back that I wasted at that restaurant.   Incompetent hostesses and management. Food was okay (appetizers and biscuits are the only good things on the menu). Drinks were good but pricey. Bar service was great. Waitress was friendly.  NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!",

Came the waitress Iris, who's full bag of humorous and fun enjoying the work and the wait of guests. Followed the introduction,  We ordered hanger steak and the ribs meal... turned out great. and i had to change my rib to pull pork because of the spicy sauce. biskets was on the house, with great freah and sweet blueberry compose and honey. pull pork with corn shoufle and mashed potato, and onion rings... i ended up finding i was so full to have any room for desert!my comment to the dishes is 'wonderful'. not to forget the sauce they make is very remarkable, definately dont want to miss while in town. and looking forward to my next visit already since there are so many things to try out!last but not least, Iris, I am glad that you were handling our food properly, you know what i mean, hehehe... and the service we received from the boss man, the host, and the crew were beyond expectedly excellent. it's beyond what the good food can offer!thanks for offering us an enjoyable dinner!",

Coming from Connecticut, we were looking for some southern style cooking and a fun atmosphere....needless to say we were not disappointed.   The restaurant is decorated in a shabby chic style with distressed windows and doors hanging from the ceiling and had a very fun feel to it. The wait staff was so friendly and engaged in conversations about our move and were genuinely excited to have us there -- a big change from the New England style hospitality.   The food was absolutely delicious. The meal came with complimentary southern biscuits and blueberry jam which melted in our mouths, YUM! we also ordered the fried okra - not knowing what it was but at the suggestion of our waiter for a True southern experience. Also delicious. We both got the onion soup paired with a sandwich. I had the Uptown grill and my husband had the Shoo grilled cheese. We both loved our meal so much that we immediately decided this was going to be a regular place and a place to bring our families when they come visit.  WE ARE STILL THINKING ABOUT OUR MEAL....Two days later.  EAT HERE.",

When we were finally brought water my glass had food stuck to the inside of it. We ordered food and it took 35 minutes to get 2 sandwiches at 2 pm brunch on a Saturday. Unacceptable. Our server, though polite, clearly too busy. He apologized about the long wait for our food and offered desert. Food was prepared hurriedly and was awful. We ordered dessert to go since we had been there for almost an hour and a half (for again 2 brunch sandwiches) and they came out to the table not to go.  When stated we needed them to go we were told it would ruin the presentation. We asked for a box and packaged it our selves. Biggest waste of $55, at this point I wish we would have canceled our order and left. No manager ever came by. Awful and unacceptable.

I ordered the shrimp and grits with chorizo. So rich and wonderful.  The biscuit starter was mouth watering... savory, buttery and fluffy.   Everyone had a great time.  Out waiter, William was attentive, thoughtful and added to the fun despite the busy crowd and our large group.",

Out server seemed to neglect us while spending more time with other tables. One of our members didn't get her food until 20 minutes after the rest of us. The food we got was cold. We finally asked for a manager who only made excuses for his restaurants poor service. Apparently there was a \"circus\" in town and \"little people\" took over the restaurant at 4pm so they started the night in a rush and so by 630p they were too behind to recover, according to him. Our server then dropped off our bills without saying a word and waiting 15 minutes before picking them up again. We love other locations but we will not be back to this one. We finally had to get the same excuse ridden manager to run our checks. Absolutely terrible",

Shrimp and grits were creamy and plentiful with shrimp and chorizo. Fried chicken was crispy yet moist. Bone in pork chop was tasty, tender and cooked to perfection.  Great atmosphere.

I would go back though to try some of the other dishes as it was hard to decide on one of the many interesting offerings!!",

I typically get their goat cheese Shrimp and Grits. It is one of the best variations of the dish I have ever had and I am craving it again right now. It was truly unique and delicious. This time however we got biscuits and they were really dry. The nutty chicken was really good though! What was lacking was the service! Hopefully they can get that on point next time. We waited a really long time from waiting to be served once we were seated, waiting for drinks, waiting to give our food orders, waiting to get food, waiting for check. The lunch process took way longer than it should have. The Asheville location is a little better... tend to agree with that one.",

They were just about to release their cookbook so I knew it would be an exciting time to visit.  I was not disappointed.  The food is great.  We had pimiento cheese with tortilla chips and I had a veggie burger.  Both were satisfying and everything to be expected.  Also, the pickled jalapenos and pickled okra that come on the plates were pretty awesome.  Please do not confuse them for garnish!  You'll be missing out.  Now for the important part.  The beer.  The beer selection was varied and interesting with a pleasant number of local beer options including their signature Tupelo Honey Rye which is brewed with NC malts and crafted in Knoxville, TN.  It's sweet and light, perfect with dinner.  Check this place out and make sure to request to sit on the shaded balcony.  So cozy.",

My friends and I decided to come here for a Saturday brunch instead of Sunday because usually Saturdays are less crowded, but unfortunately we didn't realize there  was an event that morning, so we ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table. On the plus side, even though the bar area was full, we still ordered mimosas to drink while we waited. The large mimosas were about $10, but they were HUGE, so it was definitely a good deal. I've been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner and their brunch is (in my opinion) the best! The service is usually pretty good, it just depends on how busy they are. I've been coming here for years and I'll definitely continue to come back even though I live in the Lake Norman area now, it's definitely worth the drive!",

It says homemade but the color was a little fake looking to me. The mega mosa is a cute idea. My friend got meatloaf and it had an unusual looking red gravy, but almost every bite was eaten.  I loved everything about the decor and floors.  The hostesses were very nice and a manager checked on us a couple times. The only negative was that our server was soooooo overwhelmed.

Not to mention, Tupelo Honey has the worst coffee I've ever had; it is supposedly Counter Culture coffee, but maybe whoever is in charging of brewing it is using the mop bucket water or something? Not sure. Anyway, explore other options for brunch.",

From the very cute decor, and the friendliness of the staff.  The food was great, my friend has gluten issues, so having the GF menu was perfect.  I had the chicken sandwich with the pickled beets, delicious!  I had never had Pimento cheese before (I'm not originally from the South) so I gave it a try.  I was not disappointed. I will definately be visitng again.",

I texted my order to my guy since I was arriving later than him and requested \"Shoo mercy shrimp and grits\". He showed it to the waitress. What I didn't know is that Tupelo is now offering less for more. So the \"shoo mercy\" version with spinach, mushroom, good sauce, bacon, and peppers is no longer. In its place are shrimp & grits with chorizo, sauce, and that's about it. VERY disappointing, especially considering the cost is what it was when it was filled with goodness. $21.00 My peach lemonade was delicious.   Chefs reimagining a restaurant's most popular dishes is a trick of the enemy. A wise man once said, \"If it aint broke, don't fix it.\"  Take heed and thrive.",

I vascillate between blaming myself when eggs I ask to be cooked medium come out hard, but you know, if you're the professionals you should know how to make that happen.  We both ordered poached eggs,medium, in our breakfast dish and essentially both got two hard boiled eggs in our grits. Completely unenjoyable.  There are too many creative restaurants going up in the South End to waste one's dining out dollars here.",

Our server Jacob was very professional and friendly, he explained everything in detail since it was our first time, the food came right out at the perfect time. The pulled pork grilled cheese was delish!  We will def go back soon! And so far the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time",

We made reservations and were seated as soon as we walked in. We ordered a mimosa and an old fashioned and they did take a little while to get to us, but they tasted great! Our waitress was training so she didn't know the menu very well, but her trainer stepped in and helped when needed. We ordered the fried chicken with collard greens and fries and an order of the Shoo Mercy shrimp and grits. The fried chicken was a little dry, but the collards and fries were good. The shrimp and grits were great, the grits were creamy and the addition of the chorizo, greens, tomatoes, and fried egg really elevated the dish. We also had a coupon for a free dessert flight since it was my birthday. We got the lemon tart and the chocolate/peanut butter mouse, both of which were very good! Overall we had a great experience here and will definitely be back!",

The house made warm biscuits were phenomenal- definitely recommend drizzling with the Tupelo honey, they're named after it so you know it's good. We also enjoyed peach mojitos and a blueberry Kentucky mule- all delicious. For brunch the shrimp and grits - the pepper tapenade was delicious and had the right amount of heat.",

Our server, Aleesha (sp?), was welcoming and provided us with great service. When I asked her what she thought about the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken, she replied that everything on the menu is really good. After seeing how pleased my family was at the end of our meal, I realize that she wasn't lying.  Our meal started off with homemade biscuits with a side of blueberry compote. These biscuit were so delicious! Soft and fluffy with a nice outer crust. My meal of biscuits and gravy was perfection! It was perfectly seasoned and prepared, it was a True comfort meal and one of the best I had. If you come here, I highly suggest it. The rest of my family had the southern belle grilled cheese, fried chicken BLT, okra, side salad and Mac and cheese. Other than the okra (which was amazing) I didn't try anyone else's food but everyone was thrilled with their meals.   We also had the lavender limeade fizz and and rosemary peach lemonade a which were so delicious! The fizz was a bit too sweet for me but nothing that a few lime wedges could fix.  Overall, we were extremely pleased with this restaurant and would come back in a heartbeat when visiting Charlotte.",

On a recent visit, the waittress recommended the \"sweet tea chicken\". OMG!  Unless you like chicken that literally tastes like sweet tea - including the \"sweet\" aspect - stay away from that item. Yesterday I visited with my family. The hostess told us about their specials; both of which are priced so ridiculously high, it is obvious that you're better off ordering from the regular menu. I ordered the trout with mac and cheese and collards. The 4 adults brought our food home to add salt and other spices to create some flavor.

I've been to the Asheville on several times and yes it's awesome. But so is this location! And it's earning my 5 star rating based on it's own merits!  Let's start with the grit cakes. OMG! Cheesy fried goodness drizzeled with sriracha, fresh salsa and sour cream to tame the heat. You can taste the cheesy goodness in these grits....must be gruyere or goat cheese.....A must get!  Not being in a burger mood, I chose the fried pork tenderloin sandwhich covered with cheese and topped with a sriracha aioli, all over a green apple slice. Personally I don't think this sandwich needed the apple. Nonetheless this sandwich was OUTSTANDING! Just pick your diet relief day to come here....definitely not on the weight watchers approved list! Oh the dish normally comes with asparagus but I opted to substitute their awesome cheesy onion soup with bacon croutons....seriously?  Note: I heard that Management is going to take off this pork sandwich. Ask them for it and ask why they would take off a 5 star sandwich! I already provided my feedback. So it may not be on the menu when you come.....uggggg.  Finally I asked for them to bring out my biscuits at the end instead of as your traditional appetizer. These are always delicious! Love their homemade jam, but I really love the real Tupelo honey, ostensibly what the restaurant is named after.  A big shout out to Tiara! She was the awesome bartender who took care of me, and made me feel like part of the THC family. Go see her at the bar (shes the head bar tender) Tell her Paul sent you....She's another big reason THC gets 5 stars!  This place is THE REAL DEAL!",

I could have eaten the biscuits alone with the blueberry jam. My goodness...heaven. We had the French toast and shakshuka as well. I would have liked something other than grits, eggs, and avocado as part of the shakshuka. I had a side of chorizo added, but the amount of grits was overwhelming to the dish. Maybe some potatoes or a smaller portion. Overall, excellent food and worth the visit for the jam alone.",

It ranges from not knowing what's on tap, what the specials are and no real desire to serve.  I'm no elitist but these are sorta important.  The food is the best part of the experience and even that has been flat lately.  I like the atmosphere in general as it is cozy and a nice place to unwind.  Parking is on street and sometimes a bit of a hardship to find a space.",

Luckily my friend made reservations so we were seated fairly quickly.  I ordered a mimosa, which was just a regular mimosa...no frills or anything.  I ordered the wicked chicken biscuit sandwich (minus the egg), and was torn on two sides so I got the corn jalapeno hush puppies and goat cheese grits.  I generally don't care for grits, and I'm not sure why I ordered them, but I will say there were the best grits I've ever had!  The sandwich was just fine, and the hush puppies were fine as well.    As others have mentioned, the service could have been better.  It did take us a good 30-40 minutes to get our food, and it was frustrating to see other people around us who were seated much later get their food first.    I am a bit curious to see how their regular lunch and dinner menu is.  I am sure I will be back to try.",

But this time, while having brunch with my girls, I stepped out of my zone and got the sangria. The drink was too sweet for my tastes, however, I have a huge appreciation for presentation and these cocktails were lovely. And if you (unlike me) like sweet drinks, you'll love this one.   TIP: Always sit in the bar area if you can. It's fun and high energy. And make sure you get bartender Murphy. She'll make your drink however you like it and she's a sweetheart!",

Biscuits were good- sure wish the honey was on our table like the others but not that big of a deal, I asked the bartender for some.  Husband ordered grilled cheese, I ordered veggie plate. 30 minutes later, we received our food. It should be noted that it was NOT busy at this time.  Food comes: Brussels sprouts- watery and not that good. Mac and cheese- close to box version. Cauliflower was ok. Okra was delicious. Oh yeah, and those four coat $13. Wow   Hubby's grilled cheese had onions on it - they were hidden and he was not pleased upon finding them. He specifically said no onions . His tomato soup was tasty.  We did pick up a bag of the spiced pecans on the way out. Unfortunately, those didn't compare to spicy, crisp, pecans we received as a gift back in September.  This bag was bland and had way too much honey.  Overall- doesn't even come close to living up to the \"new to Charlotte\" hype. Bummer...  And guys , please refrain from banging on the wall with the cheerwine/ car painting. Really thought both would fall on our table bc someone kept nailing it from the other side.",

Our waitress was very nice and brought us drinks and took our order right away.   We ordered Brussel Sprouts, my husband ordered the Chicken Salad and I had the avocado toast and eggs.  Our entrees took at least 30 minutes to come out and we were just sitting there - the manager said the kitchen was backed up but he did hurry in to get them for us as we had to get back to work.  Unfortunately my avocado was not at all ripe - I couldn't even cut through it. At this point we had to go but they did offer to bring me another plate - the next attempt was a bit better but still had some super hard chunks. If the kitchen doesn't have any ripe avocados, they should probably take the avocado toast off the menu for the day.   There was no offer to comp food or make up for the delays or entree issues.  We had to hurry out and unfortunately don't know that we'll return.",

While we sipped on some drinks, they give you some free biscuits with honey and jelly, which are on the better end of biscuits I have had in Charlotte.  The warm pimento cheese appetizer somehow found a way to make pimento cheese better than it already was, but the Sassy Garlic Crusted Char-Grilled Chicken was the highlight.  So delicious.  Naturally we washed down the meal with their Pecan Pie, which is awesome, just like the rest of their food appears to be.  There was an odd downside to Tupelo, though.  The restaurant seemed to be populated with large groups of yuppy d-bags....I don't know if it was a weird night, or if d-bags are inherently drawn to free biscuits....  ...Either way, I definitely look forward to heading back here for food and/or drinks.",

They open at 8:00, and we got there at 8:02 - did I mention we were excited?  The Bee Line wasn't working, which the fella was bummed about, and we were the first ones there.  The wait staff was still in the midst of their morning meeting when our hostess slooooowly walked us to a table smack dab in the middle of the walking path.  We asked to switch to a booth.  The inside looks totally different than when it was Pewter Rose - more casual, bright and family-friendly.  I was amazed at how much more seating TH had than PR... much better use of space.  Our waiter was visibly ill, which was a pretty big turn-off.  The biscuits - as some other Yelpers have noted - were half the size of the ones in Asheville.  What the heck?!?  The breakfast menu also seemed about half the size of Asheville's.  I only saw one sweet dish (the sweet potato pancake), and the rest were savory.  Not even a granola dish like Asheville has... bizarre for such a crunchy, granola sort of place.  The fella and I both got the country breakfast ($7.95), but split on all the options.  I don't like sausage, but his sausage patty beat my maple peppered bacon - which was way more pepper than maple - hands down.  The eggs were solid, and my home fries were delicious, but more like potato slices instead of chunks like I expected.  The fella isn't a big fan of goat cheese grits, but he said TH's were pretty darn good.  Overall, I wanted to like TH Charlotte as much as I like TH Asheville, but perhaps another visit is in order after they really get in the swing of things.",

I love their craft beer selections, many of the locals represented as well as others from around the state and then some other craft beers as well.  For lunch I went with the shrimp tacos and a side of brussels sprouts.  The tacos were great.  Fried shrimp covered with pico and a spicy jalapeno mayo.   The sprouts were good as well and were spicy in their own way with lots of pepper.  The bartenders were good although it was a bit loud in there and one of the bartenders spoke softly so I could barely hear her.

Eggs Betty, a slight variation of a classic Benedict was the best I've ever had. For dessert we split some sweet potato pancakes- phenomenal.

Then at 1 hour 15 minutes I asked and they said that they had called us 30 minutes ago and when we didn't come up they crossed us off the list.  When I told the hostess that we had been sitting 10 feet away the whole time and I had asked twice she had the nerve to tell me I was lying.  NEVER AGAIN.  We left without eating and I will never go back or recommend this over hyped place again.  Better options with way better service.",

The last time I went, I ordered the sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken. I thought I died and went to heaven! The food tastes light and never overwhelming, and the biscuits are to die for. Every meal is started with their fresh biscuits, locally sourced jam, and locally sourced honey. Mix it all together and you have a winning recipe.",

Such a disappointment because my fav food to eat is tomato and I almost always try tomato soups at any restaurant that carries it. I just really did not like the soup here. and the salad was meh...My husband had the meatloaf and he thought it was normal (not exceptional but not bad either)  My husband said its not fair to judge a restaurant by their soup and salad ( Yea..hes right. ) so we decided to come try it again.  This time I had the Sweet potato pancakes and my husband had the Nuttty fried chicken. They were both \"meh\" .  I don't think we would be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": " Looking at these reviews, I have to ask myself what in the name of God do you people eat on a regular basis that elevates this garbage to the 4 star level?    I will start with the good, but don't worry it will be brief. The regular, no frills Bloody Mary I had while waiting at the bar was pretty good and I really liked the sitting area outside.  Ok, so that rounds out the good.  Let's move on to the drubbing Tupelo Honey deserves.  I don't even know where to start other than to say this place is a beacon of mediocrity placed on a pedestal by the simpleminded masses.  1. The Queen Mary.  This was really the crown jewel of the meal.  In the sense that it cost a kings ransom and then didn't deliver. On top of the terrible flavor it was so thick it was almost impossible to drink.  2. The goat cheese grit's are a good idea in theory, but even the greatest grits in the world are not good cold.  3. The Shoo Mercy Omelet was truly egregious.  Nothing like a crepe thin, flavorless egg mix crammed full of way too much, of way too many things.  It's supposed to be big and caloric and unwieldy, that's the whole point. However, instead of inserting entire fried green tomatoes and other intact chunks of filling, you have to break it up a little. Instead of using what was almost certainly 2 milk stretched eggs... you should be using at least 4-6 unmolested ones if you really want to do it right..and season them with something, please. It barely had any pimento cheese in it and what it did have was in one bite.  Run of the mill bacon and ham that had recently seen the likes of a peel-able plastic enclosure. It was incredibly disappointing and I only finished half of it, as I refuse to eat 2000+ calories of complete and utter crap.  4.  The grilled cheese my girlfriend ordered literally did not have cheese on it.  Don't really know what else to say about that.   5.  Everything tastes the same.  Tupelo Honey, to me, is an exemplar of paradoxical dining patterns and preferences in our society.  Bottom-line: it's big box, watered down southern BS with a smile, yall.  Something along the lines of Bubba Gump Shrimp Company having a bastard child with Bob Evans.",

My partner got his usual Chicken Biscuits & Gravy and was very dissatisfied himself. For a $36.00 ticket the food should be enjoyable.    Also, they were out of soft drinks!

Young, so he didn't know liquors but that's ok.  2) don't expect to get anything except a craft beer-no Coors or the like.  3) Biscuits came in the middle/end and were not any better than Cracker Barrel 4)Goat Cheese was amazing-highly recommend  5)I would not return-unless invited and this place was their desire.  6) Fried Green tomatoes were great but needed dipping sauce-instead of the grits probably.  7)Lastly, take a jacket, it's freezing in this place.

I've only ever been during the week for lunch or for dinner.  I've never tried brunch because I'm scared of how long the wait would be.  I don't think this is a place I'd return to, however, because 1) there are so many other places just like it 2) I think it's overrated for what is offered 3) I've never really had good service.  Servers have always seemed rushed or over-worked or something and 4) (I'm not an old lady but...) this place is too loud to carry on a conversation.   Don't get me wrong; give it a try if you're in the area, like fusion-y southern cooking or if you like the original in Asheville.  It might spark your fancy more than mine!",

I decided to sit in the bar area which I ended up waiting 10 minutes before anyone came to see if I needed anything. The bartender, who was very nice, came over and took my beer order and gave me a menu. It was another 10-15 before he came back to get my food order. As I waited another 30 minutes for my food the bartender came by and look amazed that I hadn't received my food yet and sent someone to check on it. My food came out 5 minutes after that. Someone who I presume to be a manager or possibly an owner came by, apologized and offered me a free dessert. Everyone was sincerely apologetic but my criticism is with staffing on the bar side. Having the bartenders wait tables on a Saturday night seems to be a little misguided.",

The portions will not leave you disappointed or hungry.  We came at 7pm on a Saturday and was seated right away by a warm and friendly Hostess. Our waitress was plesant and helpful with making a choice and our water glass was never empty.  The Menu isn't overwhelming with too many options but just the right amount to make a great selection. I had the Shoo Pancake served with bacon, candied pecans, warm maple syrup, and a crisy, absolutely delicious, boneless chicken breast. BTW, the Pancake is HUGE and it's sweet potato. I am sooooo happy right now!   The sweet potato pancake taste like sweet potatoes! Not some food coloring or spice but an actual sweet potato  the only dislike was my bacon. I love my bacon well done, extra crispy, a little Cajun, lol.  Although it wasn't bad I just wish it was crispy. This dish is not overly sweet; it was a great balance of sweet and salty.   My Husband had the Fried Chicken with the brussel sprouts and fried okra. You can choose your own sides and they have yummy selections. It was two pieces of boneless fried chicken breast with yummy gravy over it. The Biscuit that comes out before your meal with the blueberry perseve is delicious. The right amount of crunch on the outside while being moist on the inside.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes. The price is right, the place is warm and the staff is friendly. I'm definitely bringing friends back with me.",

We ended up choosing the baked mac-n-cheese, pecan pie french toast, and the chicken and biscuits. You can't go wrong with any of those! We will definitely be back to try more!",

I cannot find one thing to fault with this dining experience from start to finish.  The service was great, the food excellent, the outdoor porch/terrace dinning as the sun was going down made for a great evening.    I would highly recommend the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, the buttermilk chicken and pancakes with pecans was all delicious while we shared the desserts and both the buttermilk honey cheese and the S'mores desserts were outstanding!    I would recommend Tupelo Honey Cafe Charlotte to anyone who was looking for a good meal while in town.  I know I will certainly be dining there next time I am back.",

I order two scrambled eggs bacon and potatoes - my partner ordered an omelet with potatoes.  After about 15 minutes the server came to tell us they were out of potatoes and offered grits as a substitute - neither of us  Are grits fans so she offered toast - fine  My plate arrived with scrambled eggs soggy bacon and grits  - the omelet came with just the omelet with the promise of toast.  My toast came the same color and texture it came out if the wrapper  - I politely  asked that it be toasted   - taken away  - arrived again the same - delivered by a floor manager - I asked again if it could please be toasted and could the other order of toast be delivered??   Finally after  we had eaten our breakfast the toast arrived un buttered  -  I asked if it would be possible to have some butter  - the floor manager arrived with a small container of ice cold hard butter.   Really - certain not paying any attention -   For a breakfast of $43.00 i certainly expected more. - never again   A Chicagoan in Charlotte",

When you get seated, you get warm southerner biscuits with blueberry jam    The menu has about a thousand and one amazing things you have to try. I had eggs, Brussels, and Mac n cheese. Unfortunately the Brussels were a disappointment. Brussels are my favorite thing in the world but even I can cook them better than that. The mac n cheese though .. That was heavenly. Cooked to perfection. My eggs came out cold which was a bit of a bummer but we're still yummy.   Everything from the burgers to waffles looked amazing as it came out of the kitchen. Definitely want to go back and try some other items on the menu.",

The food was so good! I ordered a black bean burger and fried okra. We also got biscuits with honey and jam and they were amazing. Next time I go I want to try their breakfast.

    "text": "Had breakfast here before dropping my dad off for the airport. I was unsure if the wait was long at 9:30 am, Sunday brunch and all, but we were seated immediately.  Atmosphere was open and inviting at their patio as well as in the restaurant.  Biscuits were insanely good, and free. Dad had the sweet potato pancakes and they were great, with just the right sweetness for the pancake itself. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was creamy, cheesy, and with the chorizo, had a good kick!  The service made all the difference for my experience though. Carly (If I spelled your name wrong, I apologize) could've been simply standard. However, she was incredibly friendly,attentive (but not annoyingly attentive) to our table, and gave suggestions. She was a multitasking wizard, getting our waters/coffees refilled while also holding conversations with us and the rest of her table. After telling her we were headed to the airport she asked us if my dad wanted a coffee to go for the trip. Gotta say it again, the service really made my time at Tupelo Honey in Charlotte super awesome!",

The hostesses were great and greeted us with a smile, even though the wait was long (Saturday at lunch took about 40-45 minutes for our table of 4  to be seated.  Which we expected, it just opened!) Lunch was fabulous.  I love their kids' menu--their philosophy is that kids can eat the same offerings as the grown-up menu, and my four year old had fried okra, sweet potato fries, and honey glazed fruit salad.  Maybe not the healthiest, but better than processed nuggets and greasy fries! The rest of us loved it.  The open-faced Mamie's veggie sandwich was good, my husband enjoyed the Shoo grilled cheese, and my oldest girl loved her chicken and biscuits--With a side of Brussels sprouts because you always need something green!  We finished off the meal with a Cheerwine float and banana pudding.  This was a real treat, and I can't wait to go with friends! (They do have an elevator for those that need it, but we just took the stairs.)",

Glasses were piled up and oranges that had been zested sat next to personal binders on countertop. The bar tender never cleared away plates. Another worker who was in restroom with me left her stall with toilet paper on floor. Empty rolls on floor and toilet paper holder was broken. Didn't even bother trying to pick it up.  Food- blueberry jam was cold and dry. The grit croutons were not impressive. My salmon with the glaze was not good. Drenched in glaze (which wasn't good in the first place). My two sides weren't as good as another Tupelo's I've been to in another state.",

Good, well prepared fresh ingredients make food that just makes you want more. My waiter even said, \"hey, it's a judgement-free zone\". The service was great, love the space and feel of the Cafe.   The Banana pudding was so good I bought the cookbook (first cookbook, the yellow one) to get the recipe.   Had a pork sandwich, sort of like the version served in the Midwest, but with apple slices, havarti and cheddar and a siracha aioli. Complemented with excellent brown-butter Brussel sprouts. It was beyond delicious!  They also serve everything on the menu (breakfast) all day (breakfast4dinner). How can you go wrong?  Did I mention they're coming to Raleigh?  I'll be at the front door on opening day. Can't wait.",

I got the wicked chicken biscuit and our amazingly awesome server, William recommended that I get the potato cluckers or something like that as a side. So glad I did. The wicked chicken sandwich/biscuit was SO good. My entire plate was empty, I didn't leave a crumb. My husband got a breakfast plate and said it was all great but the biscuits and grits were both out of this world. We also both got the house margarita and it was great with a chili sugared salt rim. We were really impressed. Then as I was walking to my car, our server, William ran out to chase me down in the rain to return my cell phone to me that I left on the table. We will be back very soon, like hopefully this weekend!!!",

We were visiting from out of town and from the minute of walking in the front door, the place smelled like some good southern hospitality and home cooking! Our waitress was really friendly and patient; which is actually a big thing for me. Dishes came in huge portions and were timely. The fried chicken breast had no bones, and was perfectly seasoned to a mouth watering crisp. They had a awesome selection of flavors for hot sauce or just sauces in general. In addition to my meal I had a sweet potato pancake (yes!) and my gf enjoyed a blackened catfish meal. Food was on point, and I will certainly be back all the way down from New York!",

A few of us went for lunch at the end of March, but since then I have constantly been taking about the food and service with my friends and family. I tried the Queen Mary which was a unique drink and very delicious, followed by the Shoo Mercy pancakes, a meal I have bragged about to all my friends. The sweet potato pancakes were on point, the fried chicken breast was very juicy, and the bacon, pecans, powdered sugar, and maple syrup sent me into brunch heaven.  To top things off, our server Lynn was extremely sweet, very energetic, and made great recommendations for us visiting for the first time.  Coming from the food industry myself, there are those servers who are good at their jobs, then there are servers like Lynn who take the dining experience to the next level. Thank you Lynn and hope you treat yourself with a Queen Mary!",

I walked by several coffee shops before I decided on Tupelo Honey Cafe. I looked it up on Yelp and notice the star rating so I said,\"What the heck\"!!! I didn't read the review until after I ate. I glanced over the menu and stumble across Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancake. It was a sweet potato pancake with bacon on top, a fried chicken breast on top of that, roasted  pecans and maple syrup. I have to say, it was the best pancake combo I've ever had in my life!!! Shrimp and grits was also ordered as well. For $21, I would have expected more that 4 medium size shrimp. But I was told that is was awesome!!! Before the meal arrived, we receive biscuits with honey and preserves which was awesome as well!!! I will be back and that's a promise!!!",

These were sent back and came back cooked better. Over all the table agreed the food was ok, but not good and not a place we would come back to. (At least not for dinner, maybe breakfast is better?) Also the food was over priced for what we got and how it tasted. The staff/servers were all quite nice and friendly. But over all we were disappointed with our experience here.",

For $18 you get a chicken breast and two sides and I was expecting a lot more for that price. I must admit the fries and macaroni and cheese was great and that's about it.  Too much hype for that place.",

He explained that the establishment is farm to fork including non-hormone or genetically enjeneered foods and that all of the food is made onsite.  Everything we had was outstanding; the bloody mary, the Margarita,  the complimentary biscuits and our entrees.  Yum.  Thanks Dylan for making it a great meal experience! Highly recommended.",

As Jerry Seinfeld says\" anyone can take reservations, it is the holding that counts\".   Sat at our table another full hour without being served our main course. Eggs and grits-not complex! The waiter just kept telling us that Sunday brunch is always slammed. So my advise is don't go on Sunday morning.   My food was so, so-I was beyond hungry by then and my sons eggs were cold-how did they manage delayed service and cold food?  On second floor, steep stair walk up and available elevator near street. Adequate parking lot, casual dress, prices are average, and full bar.",

The waitress was ok but never really seemed to check back and took forever to get our bill. Food was terrible. Fried green tomatoes would have been good but the grits were cold and the tomatoes Luke warm. Biscuits were cold and tasted stale. I got fried chicken and it was soggy not crispy and the Mac and cheese was dry. Husband got the ribs and they were ok not extremely tender. I heard others complain about food not being hot. We should have said something but we wanted to get out of there as it overall was poor. They should have noticed when we had half our plates not touched and didn't want a box...Definitely won't come back for dinner... maybe will try brunch again when it's so busy food has to be hot.",

Their coffee is very good, I was even able to drink it black which I only do with a select few coffees, and of course the biscuits were as delectable as always! I got the sweet potato pancake and a side of scrambled eggs, which was amazing! I wanted to finish it so badly but I was so full my stomach just couldn't eat any more! I also had a mimosa which was perfect other than I had to wait until noon to drink it, but that's not their fault that we are in the Bible Belt! Will definitely be coming back! My mom was excited to come back and visit....and come back to Tupelo honey, which says a lot about this place! :)",

We actually made a reservation on Open Table becuase we knew it would get packed quickly and it did. Btw if you didn't get the clue, you can make a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. We ordered a round of mimosas and every single time I order a mimosa here, I forget that they use fresh orange juice and it has the pulp. I'm not a fan of pulp but I drank it anyway. They brought us the delicious biscuits and I drizzled honey on mine. I ordered the BLT chicken sandwich with a side of the goat cheese grits. Their grits are so creamy and delicious with the goat cheese. The chicken sandwich is good. I subbed the dijon mustard for the cranberry bbq sauce. The sauce is a bit tart bc of the cranberries but I like it. I love Tupelo Honey and visit often.",

Julie was amazing with the service she provided from start to finish!  Now for the food...holy moly, it was out of this world. True southern food, everything made from scratch in house, farm to table. Every bite was better than the next!   We had the brussel sprouts to start and the homemade ranch wonderfully complimented the delicious fried gems! I have had buttermilk biscuits before, but nothing compared to the buttermilk biscuit I enjoyed tonight. The accompanying honey and house made blueberry jam were icing on the cake, or biscuit in this case. We washed our delicious meal down with a tasty tropical drink in a pineapple and a craft root beer! Yes a whole pineapple. The fried chicken was on point, the ribs were fall off the bone, and all the sides (potato cracklings, corn souffle, real southern grits, and fresh green beans) were tasty!!  No meal would be complete without desert...no idea how we were able to consume it, but we somehow managed. Per Julie's recommendation we had the banana pudding and the pecan pie....both were out of this world, balanced, and neither overly sweet.   Bottom line...this is a must stop food spot!",

Then Hailey comes, she takes a look at us, and tells one of the hostesses something. The young lady directs us to a table where two people are already seated. They get up and we're told here's your table! I'm like...what?! What just happened here? I asked the hostess why was the other couple leaving, and why are you putting us here? She's a bit clueless and assumes they wanted to sit elsewhere. And my guess is, soooo you keep the plates, fork and knives here, that were here with the previous couple and plop me and my nephew here...cause we look like you can treat us that way hmmm?! I asked the hostess who told you to seat us here...she said Hailey. I gave her the look (some of you may know the look, some may not. It was that look!) and I responded with, \"Hailey is Her Name?!\" I guess word got back to Hailey, who then came back, and sat me and my nephew someplace else.  Now that that's over, we sat down at another table, our server came by who was very pleasant and on top of her game! Holiday was her name. We started off with non-alcoholic drinks, segued to our delicious appetizers, and then onto our main course! I absolutely enjoyed our food, I cannot say one bad thing about the entire meal! I do want to return. I honestly don't ever want to feel like you can look at me, and judge me as if I'm not used to fine dining! Not a good feel or good look for any establishment! I would've given 5 stars, but Haileys behavior was unacceptable!",

However, It is a hotspot during Sunday brunch. When most of us don't care what time it is anyway.  Located in the center of \"Southend\", Tupelo Honey is where it's at! I have eaten here for years and recommend it to friends and family. It is somewhere I go when I have extra cash and looking to impress. Haven't seen a friend in awhile and have PLENTY of time to catch up? Well, then this is the place to go. Why? Because the service moves very slow. Not sure if they do this because they believe, the longer you're there the more you will spend, but It happens every time I visit. However, this is the only thing I can find wrong with it.  Aside from the slow service, I think the food is to die for! It is healthy and hearty, and the portions are huge. Definitely not a tapas restaurant here! During my latest visit, I had the eggs Benedict with goat cheese grits. I love anything with goat cheese so I went with my gut, and boy was I right!   this restaurant is unique because they bring a fancy twist to Southern style food. Furthermore, the street side view is amazing from the luxurious balcony seating.The perfect spot to enjoy your farm fresh meal on a warm summer day!",

As long as you like one of these two ingredients, you'll be happy.  The menu of brunch items isn't huge, but the selection is great.  I had the Jalapeno Fried Egg BLT.  The jalapeno aioli set this sandwich apart from from a regular BLT.  Delicious and not spicy, but flavorful.  The Southern Breakfast Bowl was definitely not what I pictured.  It kind of looked like a bowl of beans, grits and eggs.  It looked interesting, but I think I'll try another one of their southern-inspired items on the menu next time.  But there was one delicious treat that I didn't expect.  Step aside, Red Lobster cheddar biscuit...make room for Tupelo Honey Cafe biscuit and jam!  Flavorful and yummy.  This in itself was a reason to go to this place.  Overall, the coffee was good, the breakfast was tasty, and the service was friendly.  This is a perfect, sit-down place to get brunch with a friend or your family.  I'll definitely be back for that biscuit.",

We shared the fried okra and green tomatoes and burrata cheese as an appetizer. Then had the shrimp and grits with chorizo as our main dish. It came out with complimentary biscuits with a side of honey and jam. Pretty much devoured everything and didn't have room for dessert.   Service wasn't fussy but really attentive. All around a great experience.",

The mix of foods and flavors was not a typical offering at all, but a mix of some good 'ol southern cooking and some Cajun and/or Creole flavors that were a real treat, and I can't wait to go again. I've come to expect a \"plainness\", or unexciting mouth-feel and taste from most of today's quick restaurants, but this wasn't the case at all. The food filled my mouth with flavor, hitting on various parts of my tongue, much like a fine, full-bodied wine. Sounds a bit hokie I know, but that's the best way I can think of to describe the experience. The tastes were full and distinctive: savory and salty and sweet, all in the same bite. Definitely a real treat!   My review is based off a single, first time visit, and if I lived just a little closer, I'd have gone back several times already.   I was shocked to learn as I was leaving that it's actually a chain restaurant. I asked. The food and flavors were much more like a local Mom & Pop place, which I tend to seek out. Regardless, \"I'll be back!\"",

We decided to grab a seat at the bar for convenience. There was one bartender behind the bar, who seemed more than a little irritated that we decided to sit there. She was busy making all of the drinks for the remainder of the restaurant, and wasn't able to provide the best customer service to the customers sitting at the bar (it steadily got busier over the course of our visit).   Tupelo has a decent selection of Mimosas and Bloody Marys, which was by far the bright spot of our visit.  I've eaten here a few times in the past, and always remembered a broad selection of standard breakfast fare, as well as some more interesting plates to choose from. It seems now that the entire menu is trying too hard, for lack of a better phrase. I ordered the Appalachian breakfast, and my other guest ordered the hash. Both of our plates came out with cold eggs.   With so many different places to choose from to eat brunch with consistent service and at least better (hotter) food, I'm going to scratch Tupelo off the list for now.",

We walked into an empty restaurant and promptly asked if we had reservations rather than receiving a warm greeting. Once we got our food, old school breakfast bowl (poorly presented- looked like a pile of slop) & the avocado toast  (WARNING! ITS NOT ON TOAST BUT AN INEDIBLE INCH AND A HALF THICK AS WELL AS WIDE BLOCK OF STALE HARD BREAD- the chef called it artisan?I'djust like palatable food! ). Disappointment central. I finally asked for some whole grain toast - was told there was none but only sourdough. After a minimum of 10 additional minutes the chef brough out some SAD dry bread (not even toasted see photo) and mentions they had a multi gain bread. Seriously? So we get the bill. I'm charged for the sad white bread. We were charged FOR EACH CUP of coffee, not per person ( no coffee refills?!?!?) We will never be back. This place is a total disgrace to breakfast and brunch.",

I don't know if they were just having an off day but waiting an hour for overpriced and mediocre food to be delivered to our table with lackluster enthusiasm are not traits of an establishment I care to frequent.  I paid $21 for 4 meager strips of steak in my \"Steak and Eggs\" - I've had more steak in a budget burrito at Taco Bell.  The half of a potato worth of a side was laughable too; laughable by the ownership I'm sure when they realize they are taking in a 150% profit off of screwing people out of an entree. I can't help to feel a little ripped off.  All of our eggs which were to be poached ended up being mostly underdone, my moms \"fried green tomato\" sandwich had red tomatoes, our drinks went unfilled for long periods of time, and zero f***ks were given by our waitress.   Never. Again.",

I ordered the Southern fried chicken BLT and fries while she ordered their  black bean burger. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and even tried some of her black bean burger as a meat eater the texture was off for me but it was seasoned extremely well. She also ordered one of their margaritas, I opted for a local brew. The service was superb, we were checked on often throughout the night. The location is great and I can't wait to use the outdoor seating that looked extremely comfy. Also the elevator was a great addition after a night of drinks. great job there.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. Finally the chance came when my friend wanted brunch and I couldn't figure out a good place to go that was open before 11:30. The restaurant is definitely cute in terms of decor and feeling welcoming, but the positives of the vibes probably end there. To be fair, we sat inside - not that the hostess even bothered to ask about a preference, but sitting outside could have a nicer ambiance than what I experienced today.   The hostess politely tried to sit us at a very small table at the back of the restaurant. Upon seeing the size of the table, I felt like the plates would be too crowded with drinks and such and requests a larger table as there were 10-15 empty tables. The hostess cops an attitude and walks about to the front to 'check to see if she could do it'. I sheepishly follow her like a lost puppy dog that just got berated for chewing up a shoe. She then takes my friend and I back to the back of the restaurant by the kitchen/washroom door and seats us. Really? All the empty tables and you put us in the back by the kitchen? Honestly the table she sat us at probably shouldn't even be there as the whole time my dining partner was constantly hit/bumped by servers trying to pass through with food/dishes. At one point a waiter actually asked him to move so he could get by. I'm sorry if there isn't room for a customer to sit at this table without being told to move by waitstaff while sitting normally...then that is a good clue the table shouldn't be in that location. Honestly a very awkward and awful experience and that isn't even including the innumerable amount of times I heard distressing loud noises bellowing from the dishwashing area...not what I expect in terms of ambiance when I am paying ~ $20/entree.   Despite the seating issue and the attitude of the hostess the food was amazing! Biscuits were very well balanced with the salt and pepper standing up to the blueberry jam. Ordered the Omelets with pimento cheese, green tomatoes, bacon, and ham. Seriously one of the best omelets I have ever had.   Worth a visit for the high quality ingredients and great tasting food, just be firm about being seated in an area where you won't be treated as a nuisance by staff.",

We had a party of 6 and our reservation was at 12:30. We waited quite a while past 12:30 to be seated, but we didn't mind that so much because they comped us two appetizers for the inconvenience.   The appetizers were great. We got the fried green tomatoes and avocado toast points. My entree wasn't great. I had the Old Skool breakfast bowl, sub scrambled eggs for over easy. My friend ordered the same bowl and had different modifications. When our meals arrived (after a lengthy wait) my scrambled egg bowl had her modifications, and her bowl had over easy eggs but no modifications. This was pointed out to our server. It wasn't a huge deal but since we didn't get what we ordered, a discount might have been appropriate. The bowl itself was sort of flavorless and the grits were dry.   The service was not what I would expect. Our waitress didn't know anything about the drink I ordered (lavender limeade which was delicious by the way). It took a long time to get our food (not the server's fault) and an absurdly long time to get our checks.   I don't think I would return to this location, but would happily return to Asheville or Raleigh!",

I had the pimento burger with fried pickles and it tasted like a paper sandwich. I did not taste the meat. It was as though the burger was washed in water then grilled. The restaurant was extremely packed so if you plan on going, you should call ahead and make reservations. The food prices were overpriced and my burger was not worth $14. I had better burgers at Burger King. I don't think that I will be going back.  I went back on 4/7/2018 to giveTupelo another chance. We had chipotle wings, sweet potato pancakes with eggs and fried chicken, shrimp and grits and fried chicken with gravy, Mac and cheese and collard greens. Totally different experience. Alec was our server and he was great: friendly, attentive and personable. The food was satisfying and came out fast. We went during non peak hours so there was no wait time to be seated. Great time.

    "text": "Been here twice on various trips to Charlotte and I will definitely keep going. First of all, the biscuits in place of a bread basket are amazing. The blueberry jam served with the biscuits is great, we ate it all right up. On my most recent trip I had an omelet with pimento cheese, jalapenos, fried green tomatoes, ham, bacon, etc (shoo mercy omelet). It was a strange choice for me since I'm not usually an omelet person but it was really good, I'm glad I got it. I believe I got the shrimp and grits on a previous visit and also enjoyed it. My friends all really enjoyed their food, including the breakfast bowls and eggs Benedict.   It is extremely popular and you need to make reservations in advance. Several days before the weekend, the only brunch time slots available were during the 9 am hour. They have a fairly large parking lot attached, but it was practically full but they time we left around 11.   Took one star away because service wasn't as good as it could be on this most recent trip, even though it wasn't crowded when we got there. Took awhile to get coffee refills, etc. Definitely not bad though. Wish they had somewhere to hang your coat, like hooks on the end of the booths- it was unseasonably cold and we didn't know what to do with our coats and bags while sitting in the crowded booth.",

The food is a little bit more expensive but all of it was good - I personally had the tea marinated roasted chicken, very tasty.  The sides were good too.  Also tried their own honey ale and that was good as well!  Overall, very happy I finally got to try it out.",

At least the location in South End, has turned into the most unprofessional, apathetic place I've ever gone into.   This time was my last time.  They brought me to the back corner by the host stand, removing a sleeve of to-go boxes so I could THEN sit down. My food came out (ALWAYS delicious, which is why I'm giving the two stars) although this time slightly cold and with a clear lack of effort in presentation (and for $22 shrimp and grits...I think they could try harder). Two servers stood right beside me, less than half a foot away, rear end IN my face, messing with her hair, as I tried to eat. Trying to ignore the gossip and flagging down the server to pay and get the hell out of there was when I decided I was never returning.   Now...this was during All Star Weekend, but I would've thought the effort would be stringer with the increase in crowd.",

Add an egg and only a dollar more. A lot of people were also drinking cocktails but I didn't partake.   Family oriented restaurant too but overall a casual place.

We came into contact with three staff members who had personalities like a long lost best friend. They made us feel welcomed and part of an experience not just a place to eat and leave. They took the time to know how our day was. Where we are from. Why we are here. And what would make our dinner with Tupelo's memorable.   The manager was out meeting people and made her way to our table. When you are there look for a beautiful dark hair lady named Mary Ellen. Other than the food (which I will leave till last) this is what made the experience for me so memorable. She was funny, lent an ear to my silly stories and lame jokes and was very kind. I'm grateful that she came to say hello.   Now the food... OH MY GOODNESS! If you like fried chicken.... Get the buffalo blue cheese crumbles amazingness... I thinks that's what it's called lol. It's close you'll see it. Oh and finish the night up with pecan pie!",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 32/100  Stumbled upon this place while trying to look for a good lunch spot before heading to the airport and decided to eat on the west side of Charlotte. This is quite a busy place during a random weekday lunch!   I like that there was plenty of parking options behind the restaurant, since it was also close to a metro station. The restaurant is on the second floor, so you will have to take either flight of the stairs to go up. As soon as you walk up the stairs, you will see a very inviting environment, with string lights and cute outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy a nice day outside.   My party was seated inside by the window, and I immediately nerded-out looking at their ceiling fans. Their ceiling fans are connected together by a pulley system, and powered by a motor! Pretty darn cool.   Not knowing what to order, our server first brought us some corn bread to share with some berry-type jam and honey. Mixing the berry jam and the honey together was the best! We then ordered a Grilled cheese pork sandwich and a pork shoulder dish.   I was actually quite disappointed by the pork shoulder dish. I wish that the meat was a bit more juicy, but most of it was rather dry besides the part that has some fat on top of it. It didn't have much flavoring besides the toppings on top of the pork shoulder and I wish they had a dry rub or marinated it a bit before cooking it. The Brussels sprouts sides and the fries were amazing though! And the Grilled Cheese Pork Sandwich totally made up for it! It was sweet and salty all mixed together. Although it was slightly on the oily side, it tasted amazing and I didn't mind.   Overall, I had a great dining experience here. The ambiance here reminds me of a cute southern town, and I just wish I ordered something else on the menu that they were probably more well known for. Until next time!",

For dinner I had the Appalachian egg rolls, which are southern pulled pork egg rolls served with a jalepeno bbq sauce.

The first time there was an 1 1/2 hour wait and people were standing all over the place waiting on a table. I left!! The second time, I waited 45 mins. Normally they have free coffee for people who are waiting but today they decided to NOT refill the coffee.   Service: First of all, the service is horrible!!! Once we sat down, the waiter tried to take our order before we could read the menu. We order coffee/water then asked to look at the menu. He came back with just the coffee, took our order, and never came back for 20 mins. We sat there with empty coffee cups until we called over the manager to get a refill and find out about our food.   Food: We ordered the crab scrabble and the sweet potato pancakes which were both cold once we got them. The food tasted fine but I could have made a better brunch at home. I was surprised because I really loved Tupelo Honey in Asheville.   In my opinion, I probably would not return here for Sunday brunch. I would just go around the corner to Crispy Crepe or 300East...they both have good service and brunch!!!",

We kept looking to see where all the fun we were hearing was coming from and behold it was across the street.  We changed venues and ordered at THC. The food was great and the service amazing.  I loved it, she loved it and we both ate entirely too much.  The lemonade was fantastic!",

The pecan, cranberry and mandarin orange quinoa is absolutely fantastic! The fried chicken had great coating,  but because it was boneless,  it was a little dry. If you go, make sure you have a Muddy River Mai Tai and support the only local rum distillery in the state of NC!",

    "text": "I know, I'm a food snob, so I'll let the raving reviewers revel in their average palates, which this area breeds. The place was uncomfortably warm, and while it was 90+ outside, it is no excuse for a business and especially with the price to food ratio.  The staff were friendly and the waiter compensated for his average waiting skills by being friendly. At least when asked, he eventually filled the glasses, coffee and served the table. Frankly, don't quit your day job, or try to learn your craft. The biscuits were ok, a bit small and over seasoned. The honey was nothing to talk about, although the side blueberry jelly seemed homemade or was a reasonable facsimile. It was a nice touch to provide 1 per person free in lieu of bread. The execution of the entrees were rather pedestrian and over priced. The table ordered the chicken and biscuits topped with an egg and ham pieces. The egg was cooked as ordered and the Chicken piece ( yes, it was almost a finger, but slightly bigger) was ok. The Ham pieces could have been freeze dried and overall, it wasn't worth the price. The other dish was the hanger steak and eggs which was originally served cold and had to be returned. After re-presentation by a manager ( no compensation offered for the inconvenience... Yes, table parties eating alone) the steak was paltry, less than 2 oz but cooked as ordered. Eggs made as ordered and potatoes served as crackles, another code word for fried.  Overall, not a place to go out of the way for and certainly overpriced for serving size. I won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I don't know what is up with Charlotte lately, but this will be my second bad review in a week. My husband and I came here on Sunday for brunch. Having been to the Asheville location he was excited to try this one. I have been to this location once with my girlfriends and knew that there would obviously be a wait. When we arrived sure enough there was a 35-40 minute wait. Okay sounds fine and we were informed that we could sit in the bar if a table opened up. As luck would have it (or so we thought) a table opened up! Sure! Take our beeper for our table! We already have one in the bar area! BIG MISTAKE! After waiting about 15 minutes to get someone's attention we were finally able to get some water and coffee. At the same time we ordered our food as we didn't know when we would e able to get her again. However, there was no sugar and after going to the bar several times and telling our waitress it finally arrived about ten minutes later. Just in time to have my coffee be cold before even tasting it. So, 25 minutes to enjoy a coffee. And we waited for our food.... And waited.... And waited.... All during this time to see other people who were seated after us in the bar area enjoy their food. After trying to get our waitress' attention (looking directly at us and us about to speak she literally would ignore us and go onto the next table! Not even acknowledge that we needed anything!) when we finally got her attention (after sitting down for an hour and about 50 minutes or so since we ordered our food) we asked her where our food was. She said the kitchen was backed up yada yada yada. But, if that was the case how come at least two other tables before us were served promptly and AFTER we had sat down. About an hour and 20 minutes after sitting down we got our food and basically not even an apology or wanting to comp so much as our coffee. It got so bad that my husband and I were about to walk out right before they sat our food down. It takes a lot for my husband to be upset with service to not come back somewhere and to be honest I don't know if we will ever come back to this location... At least not for Sunday brunch.",

    "text": "Very disappointing experience.  My husband, child and I came in for a late lunch this past Saturday.  Looking back we should have left we waited five minutes to be seated and were not really greeted. We requested a high chair  & when we were given a high chair it had visible food on the seat that we had to remove. Apparently the high chairs are not cleaned after usage.  We were given biscuits doughy and nothing special. Blackberry jam had a nice taste.  I order the black bean burger (paid extra for cheese), with a side of asparagus.  The plate came with the burger and asparagus swimming in sesame oil. The asparagus was not edible due to the sesame oil. All you tasted was oil when you bit into the asparagus.  The black bean burger was ok the bun was toasted prior to being placed on my plate but the bottom became soggy quickly with he oil. The pimento cheese that I paid extra for didn't even cover the burger it was maybe a half a tablespoon of cheese.    My husband had a burger he said based on his meal he wouldn't come back.  You would think you could get a burger right... Charging extra for cheese come on!   Charlotte needs new & different restaurants but this is not it. This restaurant is very similar to the restaurant Toast but more expensive.    Recommendation drive a little further down the street and eat at Luna's Living Kitchen organic, vegan, fresh for the same price!",

We enjoyed a nice bottle of Cabernet at a reasonable price and found a seat in the bar in about 15 minutes. The service was impeccable, the food was somewhere between average and below, yes it was ...we are very sorry to say. We tried the Pimento Cheese dip appetizer which was pretty good but the chips were not. At best the chips were the ones you do not pick up in the grocery. My guy had the meatloaf which was somewhat dry, way over salted. His mac and cheese was just okay. I had the black bean burger, it was fine...not great, not awful. I ordered the greens for a side which tasted as if they had been sauteed in lard, perhaps rancid lard. We will go back for drinks because everyone was so nice, but we are both pretty sure we will not dine there again unless things change. All of this for an easy $80.00 is a little tough to swallow in Dilworth where we have so many other good choices.",

Wait staff did their best but managers stood around staring into the kitchen. Dried okra, congealed gravy, cold biscuits. Asked for a second cocktail but waitress never got around to it. This is the WORST dining experience In Charlotte!  It's only a matter of time until they are g-o-n-e- and thankfully so.",

    "text": "Tupelo Honey has great food!  The menu is very large, with so many options.  As a vegetarian though, they do put bacon/ pork fat in some foods you wouldn't expect so it's worth asking about.  This is not a diet friendly place :)   There is a long wait for a table here, with limited waiting seat space but I've never waited more than 45 minutes on a busy day/night.  They said they were not able to accommodate my bachelorette party though.... so that was disappointing.    Maybe the hype will wear down in a few months to lessen the wait time but the food really is good with so many unique food and cocktail options.  My husband doesn't drink blood Mary's but loves their bacon/jalapeno version.  The sweet potato pancake is about the size of a dinner plate but pretty good.  The biscuits and fresh blueberry jam are delicious!    The only complaint I have heard people say is that the decor is slightly cafeteria looking or bland, but it doesn't take away from the tastes.  Worth checking out at some point if you haven't!",

Our waitress was very friendly and really helped us with our questions about the menu. I ordered the fried chicken BLT with a side of goat cheese grits. Those were the cheesiest grits I have EVER had, very delicious! The Fried Chicken BLT was very moist but lacked a little flavor for me. The bacon had way too much fat on it, I had to remove from my sandwich. My boyfriend had the chicken wings appetizer, and for a appetizer those were some pretty big wings! The sauce on the wings had a little spicy kick but still sweet. The chicken seemed to be double breaded which gave that extra crunch we like. We also ordered a side of the homemade Mac n cheese, this was not as cheesy as I would have liked. I can say there was nothing special about the Mac n cheese. The homemade biscuits they give you are so buttery and warm, and awesome with the blueberry jam! We will try this place again for breakfast.",

We were seated about 15 minutes later next to the entrance to the bathrooms - which is not a problem except about a dozen tables were empty thru out the restaurant - was the problem they had too few servers or the can the kitchen not keep up with the size of the place - who knows?  Server was Jonathon who was outgoing and engaging and earned a superior tip.  Biscuits were great and quite filling and maybe we shouldn't have order the fried okra (which were home made style and very good).  Omelet for my daughter and Charleston Chik sandwich for me were good.  Wife had the breakfast bowl which had very over done eggs which were corrected and Jonathon made sure the manager came over and she even delivered the corrected meal!  Good job Jonathon in making sure management is engaged with customer complaints for future fixes.  All in all, the food was good and the 4th star was earned by Jonathon's extra effort which we appreciate as good servers work much hard than most folks think.",

    "text": "We just decided to drop in on the spur of the moment on a Friday evening and were delighted to not have to wait. We were seated on the porch upon arrival after being offered inside or outside (it was a tad noisy inside). It's really nice out there on the porch even with the road noise from South Blvd. It felt a little \"vacation-y\" with the string lights and breeze, and I enjoyed a glass of wine while I was waiting for my husband to park the car and get to the table. We had the fried green tomato appetizer, which comes over goat cheese grits. The green tomatoes were very good...not the least bit greasy, and the grits were quite tasty, although they needed a little bit of salt. I ordered an Uptown grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup for my entree. The grilled cheese was VERY cheesy. If you like a lot of cheese you'll love it. The bread was perfectly toasted and the tomato soup was truly yummy. Dip your grilled cheese in the soup, mmmm...  My husband had the catfish and it came over more grits. He said his catfish was nice and light with a little Cajun spice to it, but he was tired of the grits from our appetizer and didn't eat them, and that was the only side other than some salsa, which he also passed on. I would have put the salsa over the grits if it had been my dinner, but he's a pretty picky eater. They bring homemade biscuits to the table along with warm honey and blueberry jam. Even if you're cutting back on bread, that's worth making an exception. The biscuits had a perfect crust. Our waitress was in training and she did a superb job of taking care of us. Very friendly. I'm looking forward to trying Tupelo Honey again. Maybe for breakfast next time.",

Update:  I just received my Chicken BLT sandwich.... On a scale from 0-10, I would give it a 7, not bad but nothing special either. The side of macaroni cheese I got is about a 5 on a scale of 0-10. To me, it doesn't taste like baked macaroni cheese, but more like macaroni in cheese sauce. Would I go back? Absolutely not.

For one, it took us a long time to get a server and once she came over, we realized that she had walked by our table multiple times and not said one word. A simple, \"hey, I will be right with yall.\" Would have made things a little better, but Keondra turned out to be a very nice server, although she was sometimes pretty slow, so it was bearable. As for the beginning complimentary biscuit, it was a little saltier than I anticipated, but very good paired with the blueberry jam and honey. For my main entree, we went for brunch. I had the eggs Betty and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's ham and medium poached eggs(my first time trying poached) on top of a biscuit with lemony hollandaise(which I had never heard of or tried). I picked my side of goat cheese grits. Everything was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the lemony hollandaise, but that's just a personal preference. It was garnished with a pretty little orchid, which made me happy, because I love flowers. I loved the atmosphere, liked the food, felt service could improve, but I do believe that I would come back.",

    "text": "Absolutely wonderful. 2nd time at Tupelo and it was amazing. Matt our server was attentive and kind. While service at the bar was slow our food was reasonable in timing. Matt was keeping us informed about what was going on. Our waters were always filled. The small plate of shrimp mac and cheese absolutely loved it, it is worth the carbs. The market fish (Corvina) with garlic risotto and tomatoes excellent, the balsamic flavor I believe it was on the tomatoes I could have done without. However, still good. My other two dining pals got the salmon and curried fried chicken. Salmon was gone, i saw the plate get there and i saw it empty moments later thats about it. Curried fried chicken, the pieces of chicken were rather small would have prefer one more piece and less sides. It was still delicious. The fried chicken is a boneless breast, which is more like chicken tenders not fried chicken, that's why we got salmon. To each thier own. For good southern food, I go to Tupelo.",

The place wasn't even that busy, but when all our food came out, a lot food was just missing, and we had to remind the waiter about it several times. The food was subpar.

We waited 40 minutes for our food and for biscuits, which usually come out before the food. We had to ask for silverware, after sitting here for 20 minutes, with an appetizer on the table. Once we started eating my girlfriend realized her chicken wasn't cooked through. We brought it to the attention of the manager, who quickly comped her meal. Overall, I was very disappointed with this visit. As my friends were visiting from out-of-town, this has discouraged them from visiting this restaurant again, because of the service.",

We started with the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese grits. The tomatoes were not greasy at all. The breading was light and flavorful. I didn't particularly like the grits (the texture in general off puts me not this specific establishment's dish) but the other girls devoured it!  I got the fried chicken sandwich with a side salad (no dressing). This was fantastic. The chicken (like the green tomatoes) were perfectly breaded and fried. The salad was crisp and I loved the radish on top.  This dish (like the rest) were huge. I finished the rest for lunch!",

As far as the food, typical American brunch foods. I love the sweet potato pancakes and grits and love that they have soy sausage for us plant based eaters. My homegirl and I sat near the kitchen view so it was pretty quiet and intimate for girl talk- love that set up! Their cocktails are delicious from what I've tried as well! Will return :)",

I ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and omg these were fantastic. They weren't overly fried (I can be sensitive to fried foods) and the grits were a perfect pairing for the tomatoes.  My entree was the pulled pork grilled cheese. My only complaint was the bread was so soaked in oil and that did upset my stomach almost immediately and made it hard to finish, luckily I ordered a side salad so I was able to make a good balance between fresh and greasy. I wouldn't say this is a major down side to the point that I'll reduce my rating, because most people are ok with this, but I just wanted to give a fair warning!",

I ordered it and really liked the balance between the Chorizo and the avocado and cheese. I recommend it.   Other people in our party ordered the catfish, which was mildly flavored, the sweet potato pancakes(these are a must!), and the fried chicken and waffles(tasty and very filling!)   Tip:  The sweet tea is refillable for no extra cost.   The reason for my 4stars is that the service was very slow paced. Maybe that's the southern style, I'm not sure. We had reservations for 12:30 on a Monday and we were told they were 10 minutes behind; it was confusing because when we were seated, plenty of open tables were stretched out behind our table. The food was good, but the service wasn't the quickest.",

I had high expectations for this place because I had heard good things, but I was surely let down to say the least. Our waiter didn't bring us refills except when asked, we waited 40 minutes for our order while there were only two other tables inside (our food was clearly in our vision on the counter just waiting to be picked by our waiter who was MIA hence why it was cold), and on top of that my spicy AVOCADO and egg sandwich had NO avocado! My friends chicken was dry and the Mac and cheese looked scrapped from the bottom of a pot. Only plus side was the biscuits. Disappointed.",

    "text": "So I have learned the trick is to come for brunch!  After visiting for an unimpressive dinner a couple years I lost interest.  Somehow I found myself in Denver near Union station enjoying a brunch at the Denver location and once I was back in Charlotte, my faith had been restored.  I have come here for brunch now a few times and its delicious!  The Tupelo play on shrimp and grits is rich and delicious.  The shareable avocado toast points are so yummy.  The pecan pie french toast was a bit too much for my yankee spirit but tasty nonetheless.  The brunch cocktails are great too.  Ive tried both the spring and summer sangrias (*which seem to be seasonal) and they are both excellent. The service was also consistently good.  The staff is attentive and engaging.  While there is outdoor seating I always opt for inside, as the outside can become crowded with people waiting to be seated. Sidenote, you can book a reservation on OpenTable to avoid super long waits but the hosts do make the wait somewhat pleasant by inviting you to grab a cocktail at the bar.  Nice job Tupelo!",

    "text": "Having had experiences at several other locations, and previous visits to this location, I had high expectations.  This last visit a week or so ago showed that things have gone down hill here fast.  And even sending my experiences to that location directly didn't even warrant a response, so it shows they really don't care.  It was right before a morning busy time, so not many people in yet.  Our waitress was nice, but slow.  The orders came out and both were awful.  The eggs benedict dish had eggs cooked so much, they were just about hard boiled, and the french toast was egg saturated thin bread with uncooked egg.  We sent them both back. They eventually came back out, but not much better.  The benedict eggs were hardly runny at all, and the french toast apparently used Wonder bread, and was heaped with the largest mound of ultra-sweet pecan pie filling that it was practically inedible.  The waitress wanted to argue when we sent them back saying that the eggs were supposed to be that way and that the french toast \"didn't have any egg\" because it was french toast.  Huh??!!!  Anyway, normally when a business shows an interest in their customer's experiences when contacted directly, I will give them another chance, but since they don't care, I thought I better warn people about this location:  if you have had a great meal at other locations, prepare to be sorely disappointed at this one.",

Not impressed, but after realizing that this is a chain restaurant, I became convinced that although their marketing was on point, this place kind of seemed like Red Robin of fancy Southern food.

    "text": "I stopped by this large cafe in Charlotte to do brunch with a few friends and had a decent dining experience. The location is a little hidden as we had to climb a few stairs up the side of a building to find it. When you walk in you are greeted by a very large dining hall which is almost overwhelming when you first walk in (probably because it was brunch and filled with hungry diners). However, seating was pretty quick even having a group of 5 people. As for the food the menu was southern cuisine based and I ended up ordering the fried chicken and biscuits which came smothered in white gravy. The chicken was amazing well seasoned and crispy without being hard and over fried although I could have done without the entire bowl of gravy provided with it. Of course you can't have a good brunch without mimosas in which we all ordered the Tupelo honey mimosas which were served in a glass that resembled more of a wine glass or goblet opposed to the traditional champagne flutes most restaurants serve mimosas in to stretch out the quantities but the trade off was not having a bottomless option. The only complaint I would provide is that it took about 35-40 minutes for one of my friends dishes to arrive who ordered the honey dusted fried chicken (in fairness she was the last to order of the group). However, the waitress and manager were quick to acknowledge the issue without being asked and continued to inform us of the updates with regards to the delay and gave her the meal free of charge due to the discrepancy which was very considerate. All in all we had a pretty solid brunch experience and I'd definitely look forward to returning to try some of their dinner menu items.",

The gravy on the fried steak was so tasty! The huevos rancheros were on point also. I love that it came with traditional corn tortillas. They were busy but with a view to the open kitchen you could tell they were killing it. Awesome brunch!!!  Went again to Tupelo Honey this past week! Man oh man!!!!! If you haven't had their shrimp and grits you aren't living! So tasty!!! Their Tupelo Margarita is a must try also!!! The best thing was the manager doing table touches! Being a manager in a restaurant in Charlotte as well, I always look to see if managers are on the floor speaking to guest. The GM, Johan came to our table to make sure we were enjoying everything! He didn't just stop to ask how everything was though, he asked if I had been there before, asked about my previous experience, and took the time to tell us some cool facts about the restaurant itself! Awesome hospitality! As we were walking out he even remembered our names!!!! Def will be back   Went for dinner last night to one of my fav spots! They've rolled out a new menu and the food is sooo good. Try the Fried Mac and Cheese bites......so tasty! Also tried the steak which was cooked to perfection and the taste was on point!!!! But wait.......tried the pecan pie for the first time.....OMG it was amazing! Ooooeyyyyy goooeeeyyy perfection! So delish! Go check out the new items!!!",

Our waitress failed to provide us with enough utensils and napkins, messed up 4 out of the 4 bills at the table, entirely served me the wrong entree, and didn't bother to check up once she delivered the food. We just ate, fixed the two main faulty bills, and got out of there. I assume an experience like this is an oddity for a four-star average restaurant.",

That's tough when you have a large group. The food was delicious. No one had complaints. Most of us ordered some sort of Tupelo chicken because that is what they are known for-- and rightly so. The portions are generous, but not overwhelming, plate presentation is pleasing to the eye, the atmosphere is conducive for gatherings like ours, bathrooms were clean, and on one of the hottest days of the year, the inside temperature was just right.

    "text": "goat cheese grits, Shoo Mercy Pancakes, Shoo Mercy Omelete  My husband and I went bright and early Sunday morning when they opened. There was plenty of parking in the private lot right in front of the restaurant.  The space was spacious and clean. Service was extremely friendly and professional. Our server Ashley definitely went above and beyond serving our table giving us her recommendations and constantly checking up on us (without overdoing it).   We ordered the Shoo Mercy Pancakes, Shoo Mercy Omelette and a side of Goat Cheese Grits.  The pancake came with a piece of fried chicken placed on a giant single pancake. The serving size was definitely generous and it was delicious.  My husband's omelette had pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes. Definitely a great way to go to get a taste of the South. He raved about it so I can tell he enjoyed it.  Our side of grits were perfectly made and flavorful.  The bathrooms were clean. We were the first ones seated but by the time we left the place was slowly getting busier but definitely not as crowded as it would be later on in the day.  Bathrooms were very clean.  Can't wait to go back and try other things!",

The Bloody Mary's are unbelievable and the biscuits and jam are complimentary and delicious!  I had the Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes and Fried Chicken and it lives up to it's name...shoo mercy it was good.  The second visit was for dinner and I had the Sweet Tea Brined Chicken and mac n cheese which was delicious. My friend had the Shrimp and Grits which was NOT a very good portion for a man.  Only a few shrimp (maybe 4-5) and they were on the small side.  That was kind of a disappointment but the flavor was good.  Just not enough to eat for my friend.  I like the upbeat atmosphere and the service was great too.",

Can't remember the ounces, but we both got the size that is not recommended by the surgeon general.  Then, we each got another. My friend ordered shrimp and grits (can you believe she is from New Jersey?). And, I got the Vererated Veggie Nowl, composed of grits, greens, salsa, blackeyed peas and okra.  Delicious!  Tupelo Honey especially does fried okra right.  Light, crispy and no grease.  That was a big bowl!  I enjoyed those leftovers at work the next day. My friend and I shared a piece of pecan pie with ice cream.  We needed another friend to help us eat that big piece of dessert. I might add that the service showed True Southern hospitality.  Love this place. Its heart doesn't need blessing.",

    "text": "WOW. My childhood friend, who lives in the Charlotte area, took me here for brunch while I was visiting. She has been here a few times now and swore I would love it here and she was right, I did! I ordered the banana pudding pancakes and she ordered the eggs Betty. There were a couple items on the menu I was thinking of ordering but I'm so glad I went with these pancakes! For those with a sweet tooth, these pancakes are for you! They were covered in pudding, bananas, and a very sweet sugary rum sauce they called it. These pancakes were very filling and I could not finish them all even though I wanted to! The portions are huge! My friend did not finish all of her plate either. We also ordered a side of grits (they were awesome), and mimosas, which were also really decently sized! In my opinion, this place is a bit on the pricey side. However, the food is really good and the portions are huge so I'd say it's worth it!   The atmosphere of this place was great. They had a few different seating areas inside, a bar, and outdoor seating. It was a pretty large space and the place was packed for their Saturday brunch time. We did not make a reservation and waited at the bar for maybe 10-15 minutes for a table to be ready.  Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu. The bathrooms were clean. And the decor in this place is awesome! It's got a trendy rustic vibe to it!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great brunch spot!",

    "text": "Made reservations for 1 PM for 6.  Tables were available, but we were not seated until 1:30, but only because we asked why we did not have a table.  We were told the kitchen was backed up.  We said can't we order drinks while we wait, so they sat us.  Next came ordering the drinks.  They brought me the wrong drink so I returned it.  Waitress said she would have the correct one brought to me.  The drink never arrived by the time the food was brought out (which was AMPLE time to replace).  I told the waitress to remove the drink from my ticket as I no longer wanted the drink.  Next came the ridiculous wait for entrees.  When we arrived, there was a wait for tables as the restaurant was full.  In less than 45 minutes from time we arrived, the place went from full to about 60% full, yet took the kitchen about 45 minutes to  get our 6 meals prepared only to have two of them cold.  We returned one and said remove the item from the ticket because we were not going to wait forever again for a replacement.  The person with the other cold entree decided to eat his because he was too hungry and didn't want to wait any longer.  Also, waitress brought 2 bottles of ketchup and admitted both were almost empty.  We used up both quickly and asked for another one.  Waitress did not bring another one to us.  Waitress then did not remove the entree returned from the correct ticket and we had to wait for two tickets to be fixed.  By the time we left, 2 hours had passed.   Food portions were skimpy for the price.   The place may have a nice atmosphere, but that is where the good part ends.  Was my first and last visit to this place.",

The only reason I've been more than once is because it's so conveniently located.  However, it's never my suggestion, I'm always tagging along.

    "text": "This was my second trip here, the first one was almost a year ago when it first opened. I wanted to love this place, as everyone else does. That just isn't the case ... Maybe I need to try Tupelo for brunch to get the food experience I've been hoping for.   I'll start out by saying the food was good ... I just feel that if I'm paying close to $20 for an entree, I want SOMETHING about the meal to pop and make me feel that it's worth my hard-earned dolla-dolla bills y'all. . If anything, I'd say the damn biscuit was my favorite part of the whole meal (they're that good). The nutty fried chicken was very moist, and you definitely get the pine nut taste from the crust. The gravy with it was just so-so, nothing special in my book. The shoestring fries with parmesan & bbq spice sound wayyyyyyyyy better than they actually are.  They ended up being nothing special, just your average fry with a little dusting of seasoning, I actually feel like I wasted a side dish getting the fries. I'd recommend trying something [anything] else. The mac n'cheese ... now that was pretty damn good. It was a tad spicy, maybe from pimento? Definitely pick this as a side no matter what.   I was able to try bites from my wife's meal: grilled Atlantic salmon with a maple butter glaze served with sides of pine nut edamame salad and cheesy smashed cauliflower. The salmon had a great flavor --- you could definitely taste the maple flavor on the crust. The edamame salad is almost kind of Thai/Asian flavored ... so it's definitely not a good pairing with a traditional southern meal, in my opinion. I though the smashed cauliflower was going to be basically like mashed potatoes, as I've had it other places ... and this was not the case. It was big pieces and that were semi broken into smaller pieces, but definitely not \"smashed\" as you would think. Nothing special in the flavoring of it either, just a cheesy sauce.   The service here was awesome, our waitress checked back often about refills on drinks, how everything tasted, and if we needed anything else. I would definitely give her a solid 5 stars. She also had her recommendations down pat from every section of the menu if you were unsure of what to go with. I'm looking forward to going back from brunch and hopefully really finding out what all the hype around this place is truly about.",

Husband had the pork shoulder steak with muscadine grapes, brussel sprouts and  mac & cheese, sister in law had the fried chicken BLT tacos with goat cheese grits, daughter had the buttermilk fried chicken, goat cheese grits and collards and I had the roast pork with peanut pico tacos and mac & cheese.  We had three to go boxes because it was more food than we could eat.  Would recommend getting there early for lunch as by the time we left, it was filling up.",

The biscuits that they bring out before the meal were fantastic too.    Unfortunately, there were a few minor issues with the service that lower this rating a couple of stars.  After being seated and giving our order they apparently ran out of coffee and had to brew a new pot, so it took probably 10-15 minutes to get the drinks to the table.  Also, there was definitely a problem expediting our orders - we sat by the kitchen and saw the food come out, but it took probably 10 minutes to get it from eh kitchen window to the table... which means a lot of the food like the grits and chicken were luke-warm instead of hot.    It could have just been that they were very busy as we went on a Sunday morning just before a football game, so I wouldn't let this service discourage you from going for a great breakfast.",

    "text": "For the past couple of years, we have enjoyed dining here on several occasions. We have taken out of town guests here, who have raved about the food here. But I have to say our last visit was VERY DISAPPOINTING    We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes which were great. That was followed by their famous biscuits and homemade jam, also very good.   I ordered the buttermilk  fried chicken with collard greens and black-eyed peas as my sides. They use a boneless chicken breast for that dish. The chicken arrived with the breading clumped in pieces falling off and one side had no breading at all. This is fried chicken 101. Chick fil a cooks a million of these every day and they don't come out like that.  The server said it's a chicken breast so....? As if to say, well that's normal. It was not.  I said, I am going to need another one because this was not satisfactory to me. I kept my sides while she sent the chicken back to the kitchen. The second piece was better, but we could have done a better job at home. In past experiences here the fried chicken has been really good, one of my favs but not this night. My greens were good, my black-eyed peas were undercooked, more like al dente. They were fixed in a nontraditional way, almost like baked beans with a sweeter taste.That's not necessarily a bad idea, they did have good flavor. But because they were not cooked properly, I could not eat them.  After complaining about the chicken, I didn't sent them back but I should have.   My husband had the Carolina Mountain Trout with a cornbread stuffing. He stated the trout had a good flavor but he expected the skin to be seared and crispier and it seems that they just roasted the fish. So he removed the skin. His sides were Brussels Sprouts and Hominy and Mac & Cheese. The sprouts were roasted not sauteed, had a good flavor but a little salty. The Mac & Cheese was soupy.  TH takes limited reservations and since it was a Friday night, I decided to do so. I noticed on their website that they had a new chef from NYC, who is highly acclaimed. I wondered how much experience he had with Southern Cuisine. Obviously you can be from another region and cook Southern, but it would seem that you would need some type of experience in the cuisine (like Emril Laagasse worked in NOLA for years before getting his own restaurants there). The other concerning thing was that TH has really expanded to a lot of states, going as far as Denver. You always have to wonder when that happens, is growth happening too fast,  and are they sacrificing quality for expansion. They have made changes to the menu, added a drink menu and a prix fixe menu which are great ideas, but if the food is lacking, that will not matter.  We mentioned to our server that we thought TH were having an off night and overall the meal was not what we usually expect from them. She mentioned the new chef and the difficulty of the cooks to execute the changes on the menu. She seemed to suggest that they needed more training. Apparently others had complained as well. She stated the peas were meant to be al dente. I don't know any Southern home cook who would allow black eyed peas to be served undercooked, so that totally needs to change, IMO.  I don't know why the determination was made to make changes to the menu and bring in a new chef. TH was already doing Southern Cuisine with a flare. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. We will try them again for Lunch or Brunch. But if we have another bad experience, this restaurant will probably be taken off our list of favorites.",

The egg rolls with barbecue is delicious, the tomatoes fried green, were delicious on top of the bed of cheesy grits, and the okra couldn't have been any crispier still with a yummy inside.  I ordered the fried chicken BLT sandwich and added pimento cheese on top. It was to die for. Literally way too much food. I will definitely return.   Everyone at the table was more than satisfied. Don't forget those free biscuits,served with blueberry jam and honey!   It's a way to a southern girls heart",

We started with the southern popcorn and Carolina white sauce- they were golden crispy and large in size- just perfect.....however, the homemade biscuit and jam served blew us out of the water and we could've had more than one of those....could have made a meal of them for sure!  So good-and Tupelo should never do away with the biscuit & jam- it's amazing!  For my entree I ordered the shoo mercy grill cheese and soup- my head exploded from the awesomeness!  Havarti cheese, pimento cheese, bacon, ham, basil, and a fried green tomato- how can you go wrong?!?  My only negative comment would be that the consistency of my tomato soup was very thin and watery in texture; however the flavor was nice and smokey so i could overlook the texture.  The rest of my party ordered a vegetable platter where you could select from their farm fresh sides- they were not disappointed and the other ordered a signature Salad with a very interesting mixture and combo of vegetables....all were happy and if given the opportunity- I will definitely be back!  Good job Tupelo!  I will tell you that there were other restaurants that ranked higher than Tupelo- tried one of those places a few days later and it was a total let down- nowhere near the caliber of Tupelo.....",

    "text": "It had been a while since I visited Tupelo Honey. A friend sent me a text and asked \"Brunch?\" I shot back \"Where?\" and Tupelo was suggested. I grabbed a reservation 2-3 days before the day we wanted to go and I'm certainly glad I did. When we got there it seemed as though all of Charlotte was there! I picked 10:45 on Opentable and we waited only about 5 minutes for our table to be cleared. Keep in mind to add a few minutes to try and find parking as its limited. Tupelo is very close to the E/W Blvd Lynxx stop though too.  We started with the fried green tomatoes which I di denjoy. They are nestled in a red pepper sauce which screamed Spring to me. Four slices come in an order. By 11 am, they were out of what my companions wanted to eat; huevos rancheros. So, one went with the southwestern omelet with chorizo, avocado and cheese/salsa/sour cream. Its big; probably a 3 egg omelet. She added grits. The other dining companion ordered the Eggs Betty which is their take on a benedict. Its pretty traditional. I ordered the avocado toast. Gotta eat it quickly if you don't want the avocado to make the thick, country slice of bread soggy. It was a generous amount of avocado though. It comes with some dressed greens and beets. The greens were soggy so maybe too heavily dressed.  My favorite thing I ate was the potato cracklins on the sides menu. Those are a must in my opinion! They have your standard mimosas and bloody marys, etc., but they are charging a hefty price for them. Get a glass of rose instead!",

Everyone at my table had the Fried Chicken, which was the recommended meal for the group. I personally wanted to see more variety so I ordered the burger, it was very good, loved the friend pickles on it. However, after trying a bite of the Friend Chicken I immediately had FOMO. If it is your first time, or second that is definitely a must if you are unsure. I had a side of Mac n' cheese and would strongly encourage that decision. Others had the collard greens which looked like a tasty side as well. I would love to come back to give some other meals a try, maybe next time we are in Charlotte!",

The food is exceptionally expensive for what is served. A $15+ salad should never be served with ice berg lettuce. The food does have taste and the biscuits are amazing. This place needs turnover because of the long waits. It doesn't make it a very take your time, enjoy yourself experience. Together, the waits, the rush, and the prices for this experience just aren't worth it when considering other nearby local locations that have reasonable prices, better food and a warmer dining experience.",

Served with grits, the taste of the tomato came through clearly. Very delicious and a great starter.  For main course, Mrs chose the Wicked Chicken Biscuit. The tabasco on the top was unexpected but the rest of it looked and tasted amazing. Really delish.  I chose the Grilled Cheese and it was absolutely excellent. The bite from the gorgonzola with the sweetness from the brie was terrific. Super delicious sandwich. The cole slaw on the side was great. A little vinegary, but still quite tasty.  A good meal, great service, I'm absolutely a fan!",

Having already eaten dinner that day, we didn't stay. But the young lady in the Hostess booth was SO sweet, helpful, informative of anything we inquired about on the menu, and just a GOOD EMPLOYEE. Well, yesterday we chose TH for dinner and were not displeased at all. Once again, Dominique was there to greet and seat. She even remembered us coming in from one month before. Kudos to you, sweet girl!  Matt was our server, and he did an outstanding job, as well. Starting with a quick history of TH, and then on to what's good to eat. Then he was present throughout the meal, just enough to be helpful and my glass of DELICIOUS sweeeeet tea was NEVER empty. Keep up the good work, Matt.   I will certainly recommend TH to friends who visit the Queen City. Good atmosphere, good food, and great service.",

I am very particular about my grits and they shocked me with their goat cheese grits; they were perfectly seasoned, perfect amount of cheese, great consistency, and the flavor was indescribable. I also had the Brussel sprouts, they were incredible; the biscuits were a great consistency and it was served with salted butter; lastly, I had the fries, I requested them extra crispy and I got just that!

My first impression was that the place was so cute! Very southern atmosphere with rocking chairs on the patio where you can wait to be seated. They also have the absolute most gorgeous menus I have ever seen.   We were visiting from out of town and came here to try get the epic shrimp and grits (which were good but very heavy). I also ordered the Eggs Benedict. It took a very long time for our food to come which is to be expected on a busy brunch Sunday. However, when the food did come it was cold and had no hollandaise sauce. The situation could have been salvaged but due to the poor & apathetic service we left feeling unsatisfied and annoyed.",

Kimberly, my server, was phenomenal.  Very attentive and never intrusive.  So polite and friendly.  After a small chat, she returned promptly with my drink, the manager (Chris), and an appetizer to welcome me to Charlotte....on the house!  They know how to treat customers and more importantly, how to treat people.  My absolute best wishes of success to the team at Tupelo Honey!!!",

He was charasmatic and VERY patient with the picky eaters in our group. I ordered the chicken with collards and potatoes as my sides. The chicken was seasoned to perfection and the collards were really good. There were 8 of of us in our group and everyone enjoyed there food. Tupelo can be a little pricey for the portion sizes but its really quality food so its worth it to me. I rarely write reviews but my overall experience was wonderful and Regellio was such a great waiter I wanted to share. Keep up the good work Charlotte Tupelo!",

I got the Wicked Chicken Sandwich and it came out drenched in the spicy oil. DRENCHED. My bun was soggy which is a no-no, causing the oil to take over the whole thing making it extremely spicy as it was condensed into everything. I got the rosemary peach lemonade also and I don't know how I feel about the combination. It was definitely a kick. The lavender limeade was good though! Service was also just OK.

    "text": "Took my sister and my niece here for brunch on a recent Saturday when they were visiting.  We were seated almost immediately, and given menus. I've always had great experiences at this location but this time, it wasn't that great due to the carelessness of our server.  My niece is 10, and has Celiac disease, so trying to find a place that has truly gluten free options can be limiting.  We specifically chose Tupelo, as they offered gluten free options.  Before we ordered, we explained that my niece had Celiac disease and needed a gluten free menu, our server explained that the regular menu called out the gluten free options available and no special menu was needed.  So far so good.  So, we all order our food, I got Shrimp and Grits, my husband and my niece ordered the Southern Omelette(labelled gluten free on the menu), and my sister ordered the Shoo mercy Omelette. We again made sure to state that the child's food needed to be gluten free.  After a reasonable amount of time my husband, my sister and my food was brought to the table.  This is not an unusual occurrence when dining out with my niece, as most places will take extra care to make sure that food going out to someone with Celiac is perfect. Just a few minutes later, our server comes out with an omelette and puts in front of my niece, and we confirm, again, that her food is gluten free.  The server confirms that it is, and leaves our table to let us enjoy our food.  So, as we all start eating, my niece pulls a piece of bacon out of her omelette and eats it, then sticks her fork in one of the items in her omelette and says \"What's this?\".  Folks, it was a fried green tomato, covered in breading.  I'm a little freaking out at this point, because she ate bacon off her omelette, and if it was touching the breading on the fired green tomato, she might have an autoimmune response later (basically, for those of you not in the know, she will have flu-like symptoms, including joint and body pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and spike a fever, not to mention permanent damage to her intestines).  I felt terrible, as the kid is visiting us on vacation and now, due to the carelessness of a server, she might spend one of those days feeling miserable. We call our server over and explain the situation and she just goes \"oh, let me check on that\" and leaves with the food.  She does come back with the correct omelette (we know, because the first thing we did was open it and make sure all the ingredients were correct) and then just leaves. I think the thing that most irks me is not once did we get an apology from the server for the error, in fact she seemed almost as if she couldn't care less.  I understand that people make mistakes, but we checked three times to make sure the kid wasn't gonna get glutened and only because the 10 year old was smart enough to question what was given to her did we avoid a miserable weekend for her. I will say, that I spoke to the manager on the way out and she was very apologetic and understood the severity of the situation.  This experience will not stop me from going to Tupelo Honey in the future, but I probably will be obnoxiously diligent when bringing folks with Celiac or any other type of food restriction.",

You begin your meal - brunch, lunch or dinner - with a fresh biscuit, honey and blueberry preserves.  The biscuits have just a touch of pepper on the top that creates an interesting flavor profile with savory bread and sweet topping.    The have a number of specialty cocktails - including my favorite a rosemary-lime gin martini that is only $4 during happy hour.  There is also a nice selection of local beers on tap.  The food is ...southern...which, I suppose means there's cheese, frying or both involved. There's no doubt that you'll leave full.  That being said, you can dig into a veggie plate made up of 3 or 4 options from a list of about 15.   I've really enjoyed their fried chicken, grilled cheese and veggie melt sandwiches.  I do think the menu could use a couple of busy salads - it's hard to not feel overly full when leaving here.  You can go into the bar area for a more \"adult\" feeling meal or go into the main dining room for an area that is more conducive to families. I prefer the bar area - plenty of high-top tables and a great view.",

    "text": "couple of years ago, my husband and I visited Tupelo Honey Cafe  I made a reservation for Saturday evening and when we arrived, we were seated promptly. The atmosphere is very inviting- there are many seats however it is not overly loud. The way the tables are situated with the separators, made it also seem intimate. Our waitress, Lauren, was very friendly and very knowledgeable with the menu. The pimento cheese appetizer was not too spicy nor was it too runny which made it easy to dip the chips into. My husband raved over the peach poblano pork ribs (small plates section) and enjoyed the cole slaw which accompanied it. The portion was a nice size and could be considered a meal if someone wasnt too hungry. I enjoyed the bean burger, which had the proper amount of seasoning, along with a side of mac and cheese. I dont care for hamburger buns so I put that aside and just ate the burger- I am really able to taste the sauce this way and it was good. The fried chicken with milk gravy, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts was also ordered and consumed with lots of 'Yumms and boy is this good' comments. Overall, we had a great experience. There is valet parking outside the restaurant if you wish or just drive further down the street and there is a lot on the right specially for Tupelo Honey Cafe customers. One thing to note- while the food was fantastic, all the items I mentioned might not be available. We were told that the Ashville location is the only location which doesnt change/rotate their menu items. Although this shouldnt really matter too much because based on our experience, anything you order will taste good",

The biscuits and fried chicken was tasty- if you aren't used to gravy, order it on the side because it's a lot- this way you control the gravy. The grits are made with goat cheese and are very tasty. The best thing was their sweet potato pancake- delicious and very light- wonderful taste.",

Once we were seated, the long waits continued. It took 5 minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order and then several minutes to return. After we ordered the waiter mentioned our biscuits coming out, we saw him twice before we actually received our biscuits. Then another 30 minutes for the food to come! It also took a long time to settle up the check. - wait time D-  Food. The food was ok, not spectacular. I had the black bean burger and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese came out cold, but I didn't feel like waiting any longer so I just ate it. The burger was good, minus the uncooked white onions, but I just took those off. Food B-  Love the atmosphere, outdoor seating. Food was ok, but getting to a restaurant at 11:45 and not leaving until almost 3 is too long!",

Tonight I decided to recommend it for dinner with a group of friends that had come into town and I was very disappointed and regretful of my recommendation. First, we were told that it would be a 35-45 minute wait for a group of five.  Ok no big deal! For a Saturday evening at dinner time that's to be expected. The problem was that for the entire 40 minutes that we waited to get seated,  multiple tables sat empty the entire time. Some of them had reserved signs, however 40 minutes in advance is ridiculous....or if the party that made the reservation is that late??? When we were finally seated, we were placed at a table that I had noticed being made ready 20 minutes prior to them calling us!! Why so long?  Secondly, all the host/hostest up front kept playing around with other employees and goofing off and didn't seem to be motivated.  Once we were seated we had to ask for most everything twice and some of the food was not brought out when we received our order.  I am very disappointed in the service and the food was far too overpriced for the quality. I will not be going back.",

The food is sub-par at best and the prices are too high.   Case in point, I ordered pancakes and I don't know how it's possible to mess up a pancake, but they were able to do just that. Who serves a pancake with cayenne pepper all over it and doesn't warn a customer who orders it?! Food allergies, anyone?! That's just not smart. It was beyond gross as well. They never even offered to replace the pancakes or bring anything else as a substitute. When I asked for a small biscuit, they told me, \"they wouldn't charge me this time.\" Is that a threat?! Please.... Go back to Asheville. You can keep this place. I'm not sure Charlotte wants to embrace you and I can tell you that I surely won't.",

The menu looks and sounds scrumptious, but every thing I've eaten is just ok.  Not bad, but not the best I've had either.  The food just falls flat.  I've had the Skirt Steak, Potato Cracklins, and Green Tomato Chow Chow. The steak wasn't cooked properly and wasn't seasoned at all. The Potato Cracklings were just a disappointment.  I've also got the pork chops which were just ok. I can only speak about the bar service and it was great - thus a three start review versus two stars.  I may go back when in the area for drinks, but I can't say I'll pay for another disappointing meal.",
