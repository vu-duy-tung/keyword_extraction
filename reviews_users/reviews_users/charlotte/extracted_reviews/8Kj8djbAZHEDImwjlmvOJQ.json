    "text": "Lucky Lou's recently opened in the Park Selwyn Terrace shopping center (near Portofino's, Harris Teeter, etc.) where Fairview Grill used to be.  I'd gone to Fairview Grill all of once, so when something new opened up I figured it might be worth a try (and the 50% off coupon didn't hurt).  No trouble getting a table on a Monday night, it's your basic bar setting with a big projector screen showing some NCAA basketball and a bunch of smaller tv's showing other games and even How I Met Your Mother (seriously, who watches a sitcom at a bar?  I had to divert my attention so I didn't see what happened, spoiler alert!).  The food is pretty good and I highly recommend the \"Dippin' Chicken\" - a fried or grilled chicken sandwich dipped in whatever wing sauce you want.  I went for the Barbalo and was definitely happy with it, although it didn't have too much spice to it.  The sandwich was huge, probably 4 or 5 chicken tenders squeezed onto a bun with some lettuce and bacon (also comes with tomato and onion, but who eats that junk).  For the side, definitely get the buffalo chips.  They're thicker than normal chips, more like potato slices from heaven, with some buffalo seasoning thrown on and fried.    Fiance got the black & bleu burger with sweet potato fries and didn't have anything negative to say about it.  Honey chicken pasta seemed to be a crowd pleaser as well.  Decent beer selection makes this a good place to go to when you don't feel like fighting for a table at Selwyn.",

I order mine with the buffalo chips which are super tasty. The wings are hit or miss, sometimes better than others, usually not cooked enough. Ordered nachos once and it was more chips than toppings and I wouldnt order again. They have good drink specials, pool and a huge patio. Depending on the day there are bands, karaoke or just music playing. Its a good time especially on the weekends.",

I'm not sure what it is that bugs me about this place but the atmosphere seems to be kinda....idk.... not fun? There food, from the chicken wings, fries, quesadillas and sandwiches are pretty much your standard bar food fare.  It is all decent and the service is what I would call good but the inside itself is just kinda downright depressing. They do have a nice projection TV for watching the football game on as well as a bunch of other TV's but if you are trying to hit this place for anything other than football you will for sure have to endure a bunch of screaming fans. I'd chalk this one up for maybe a decent local bar if I was in the area but other than that it's not really worth stopping by.",

A \"Drier\" Burger is fine, this one was too dry... BIG (1/2 Pound) lacked flavor, the Bacon was over cooked (Maybe Microwaved???) too dry as well, very little flavor!  The Bun for the Burger was a nice one and did not get soggy because the Burger was sooo dry... The Burger gets 2 yelp stars or less",

We got there about 945 so it was 15 minutes before Chubby's karaoke kicked off everything, so we were able to get a booth and sat down for some drinks and appetizers. We wanted to check out the vibe first so we set back and watch a couple different people go up and do karaoke. It was really cool because the crowd was mixed and there was a wide range if mysical variety. It was nice my first time going out to do karaoke(I normally do it in the basement after a couple shots of tequila) so we sat back and enjoyed the show I'm sure we'll be regulars from this point on. It cost them a star because of the lack of local beers on tap.",

Was not too impressed at first glance on the inside (dark, definitely more of a bar feel vs restaurant) and taking a little while to catch a server's attention, but man, our food was great and servers super nice and friendly. We each got the pimento cheese burger (was the special) and it was one of the best burgers I've had in Charlotte! I ended up taking half home, it was so huge with 2 patties. We also split a basket of the recommended and deliciously described buffalo chips and were addicted. Will definitely come back next time I'm craving bar food! We realized there was a side patio on our way back to the car, would probably sit there next time it's nice out.",

They have pool tables and karaoke several times a week. Drink specials every day and great service. Drinks are reasonably priced. Good draft beer selection with several local craft beers.

Lisa told me she had just put them in the bags. I can tell you that several people told me how good they were and asked where I got them. Thanks for the great service, Lisa, and thanks to Willie in the kitchen for some great wings.",

We were the only people in there to watch Monday Night Football, the place was completely empty. We ordered pimento fritters for an appetizer and a black bean burger and a blackened cod sandwich for our entrees. Service was fine, as we were the only people in there and they had a total of 4 people working. The pimento fritters were cold in the center and came with a strange sweet sauce. Our burger came out without any cheese, so they took it back for about 5 minutes and came back with a tiny circle of semi-melted cheese on top. While the black bean burger had a good flavor, it was terribly greasy. The fish was pretty terrible. The strong smell and rubber texture left us eating the sandwich without the fish. The french fries had a weird, bitter taste to them - like the oil they fried it in was bad or something. One of my fries was completely hard and you couldn't bite into it, unsure what that was about. I looked at the bill and they charged us extra for a side salad and then a dollar more for dressing on the side, plus another dollar for some sauce for the black bean burger. We paid and walked around the shopping center. On our way back to get our cars, we smelled pot smoke throughout Lucky's parking lot. I looked over and an employee was smoking pot in the car with the door open. Yikes, maybe we were just not lucky.",

In my first review I said the fish and chips were the best I ever had, so in spite of the lousy prime rib as covered in my most recent review, I went back for that great fish and chips.  It was the worst I have ever had.  The fish, tilapia, had a musty flavor.  But the good news is the taste of old basement was overcome by being fried in very old oil, dark from oxidation which makes the batter bitter.  Ugh!  Oxidized oil is not an accident.  You can see it in the fryer.  Food comes out of it very dark and--again--BITTER!    Unlike Charlie Brown who trusted Lucy time after time, I don't trust Lucky Lou's anymore.  They should change the name to Lucy Lou's.",

It's so frickin dark in this place you feel like you're walking into the unknown and it was absolutely empty on a beautiful sunshine filled day day so I was stoked to see they had a patio area. Along with that they have a good number of tables out there plus a ping pong table...or beef pong table....or flip cup table depending on how rowdy it gets there.   Typical bar food you would find anywhere but I surprised myself by ordering the Black & Bleu steak salad and it was just what I needed on a hot day. They give you a generous portion of steak, pair that up with candied pecans and bleu cheese crumbles and you have a solid steak salad. My friend got the fish and chips and when they brought it out, we couldn't stop staring at the piece of fish they served. As opposed to a few pieces of fish it was one huge piece of fish and I think the biggest I've ever seen. Like fish on steroids big (see pics) All in all, a solid place to stop by for some food and drinks. I will be back for those delightful sounding Pimento Cheese Fritters they have!",

The food is bar grub but it wont disappoint. My favorite is the BLT with fried green tomatoes...burgers are awesome and TATER TOTS! I could go on but you are sure to find your favorite on the menu.

Now, that's also indicative that I've spent too much time there but really folks, it's a laid back neighborhood bar.  Great place to watch football or March Madness.  Head's up during Football Season this is a Seahawk's Bar but it is possible to watch the Panthers on plenty of tvs.    Ambience is pretty low key and mellow, most clientele is in their late 20s to 60ish... They have drink specials and an okay sized food menu.  $5 Dollar Mimosas on Sundays! My current favorite is the chips and queso - Not spicy at all (I don't do spicy)! Their Chicken tenders are on point tho! They're crispy on the outside but tender in the inside - soooo just right!  I'm usually a ranch fan but their honey mustard dressing is delish! Tenders come with fries or kettle chips.  Fried pickle chips are pretty good, too!  There's an outdoor patio.  Plenty of seatIng available - you  can choose to sit in their booths, high top pub tables or sit at the bar.   Two pool tables toward the back of the bar.  Well-lit parking lot.

My first visit to Lucky Lous was for burger week ($5 burgers at multiple restaurants) and it did not disappoint!  The service was on point and the burger was delicious.  They had me at pimento cheese AND bacon.  We ordered a side of fries and homemade chips.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the homemade chips were delicious!  I wish we would have gotten a basket of those delicious things.  Lucky Lou's also had a drink special of $3.25 Budweiser bottles, which made my husband happy!    We will be back.",

The Alfredo was literally the most disgusting Alfredo I've tasted , they chicken was DRY , it had no flavor at all and there was barely any sauce on it . The fries taste like cardboard and also didn't have any seasoning like not even salt . Definitely not worth $40 it was so nasty .",

    "text": "I'm no gourmand. I've eaten the cheapest, barely-pizza pizza to be found: from the the prefab rectangles in elementary school to the $5 pies in college, with just enough cheese to qualify. I've even eaten pizza in developing countries. What I got from Lucky Lou's yesterday was a shock, even to this simple palate. This 'pizza' was cold with unmelted cheese! It was actually undercooked! This is something I've never experienced.   I would suggest to the establishment that if the oven is in disrepair, close the doors until it's fixed. As to the employee who pulled out this monstrosity and either couldn't tell what COOKED pizza should look like, or didn't care, I think another line of work is warranted, though from a functional standpoint, I'm not sure what you'd actually be able to do without, like, a picture guide or something.   What a waste.  Eat elsewhere.",

She made sure I was good, filled my glass before it got empty.... Good service. I got the burger & fries. And it was a good solid burger. It has come back value. It's a Seahawks bar so it's probably a good spot to go to on Sundays. That's somethin that'll I'll have to do one day.",
