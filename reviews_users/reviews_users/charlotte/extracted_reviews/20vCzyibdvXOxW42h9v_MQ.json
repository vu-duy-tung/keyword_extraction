(I've had better pea soup from a can.) She was already irritated and her confusion added to her attitude. We had to clean off one of the several empty tables even though the staff was standing around chatting with each other. The bar-b-que chicken pizza was burned, the artichoke and spinach dip with stale chips was so gross. What a rip-off for such terrible food, dirty restaurant with unfriendly staff.",

My only complaint is the food stands here; I've seemingly never had a good meal on a layover.  In comes the California Pizza Kitchen...  I'm not going to get you all giggly thinking I'm going to say the food impressed me. No sir, not by any stretch of the imagination. But there were some bright clearings in the sky. First of, the service behind the counter was very professional and fast. Secondly, in addition to the core pizza kitchen restaurant, this location boasted not only a standard airport \"quick lunch\" kiosk attached to it, but a bar named \"Taste of Carolina\" that you could order CPK food from. I mean, I wouldn't (Pizza from California? Don't be ridiculous).  Having a bar in the bullpen is a super bonus when all of us miserable souls need to stuff ourselves in a plastic flying machine and chuck ourselves cross country at 30,000 feet. For me, it's a moot addition, considering I always keep a bottle of embalming fluid in my carry-on for sedation purposes so I can stomach the high cost and close proximity to the other miserable people (Relax. I only pack it in a clear container sized at 3 ounces or less).  Note: DO NOT drink embalming fluid.",

You grab your salad from the cooler, order your pizza at the counter, then go find a seat and wait for your number to be called.

I had a barbecue chicken pizza and it was reasonably well-topped even if the crust was a little less flaky and a lot more boring.  If you like California Pizza Kitchen outside of airports, you'll be disappointed. If you like pizza in general, you'll be disappointed.

I am glad I was able to try it out and it probably will be my last time unless I go there for a party or special event. The staff was nice, the salads were pretty, and the environment was chill.

Have never tasted either before, I was torn, but was shortly saved by the friendly lady at the register who swiftly scooped up samples of each, allowing me to make an educated decision. I chose the tortilla soup, and was handed a large bowl that was both flavor-filled and warm.

I was tired of the other food court restaurants in the center of the airport.  I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza (Duh! Signature CPK!) and a small SmartWater and that set me back almost $18 - yikes.  Airport prices for ya.  After a 10-15 minute wait, I finally got my pizza.  I took it with me to my gate so I could sit and eat in peace.  This was literally the worst pizza, let alone CPK, that I've ever had in my life.  The crust, or lack of crust, or bread, or whatever you want to call it, was reminiscent of stale flour tortilla with supermarket BBQ sauce and like a few pieces of chicken on top.  The best part of the pizza was probably the fresh basil they had on there.  I can't even begin to explain how hard it was to chew the pizza given it's strange, chewy texture.  I should have taken a cross-section of the pizza - it was literally as thin, or thinner, than a flour tortilla.  Maybe a half-cooked, 3 week old tortilla.  Save your money and eat at some other expensive airport restaurant.  And skip the $5 SmartWater.",
