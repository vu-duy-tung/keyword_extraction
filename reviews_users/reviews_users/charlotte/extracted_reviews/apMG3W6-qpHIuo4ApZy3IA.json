I was worried because there were a lot of people milling around the hostess stand when I arrived.  However, I was able to get a table right away.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad which consisted of seared rare Ahi tuna, mixed greens, red onion, fresh mango and a citrus vinaigrette. At $17 for lunch, this is not a cheap salad, but it was good.    Our service was fine on this visit, and while I doubt I would go out of my way to come here frequently, I would certainly eat here again if I happened to be in the neighborhood.",

They repeatedly, and respectfully, asked him if he was driving...volunteering to call a cab.  He said he was walking, but they followed him out to the parking lot to make sure.  When it appeared he was looking for his car, they convinced him to come back in. They called s cab and put him safely inside.  Patron is safe and Charlotte drivers are safe.

    "text": "Friends rave about this establishment; we decided on a lark to go for a late lunch last week and wish we'd diverted to other eateries.   For starters, the wait staff was perhaps the most singularly unwelcoming crowd we have experienced in the city. Considering the upscale ambiance and the number of servers on hand versus the number of customers, waiting five or more minutes for someone to greet us and take a drink order is a little much. Furthermore, both of us also had, more than once, empty drink glasses for more than a few minutes during our meal. See previous comment.  We were situated near the kitchen, so I got the delightful view of our server chatting with another server while holding our drinks a few feet away from us. Our presence seemed at best to be an afterthought.   The food was acceptable but nothing exceptional; I have had far tastier meals for less money and better service at nearby Rooster's. The lobster in my lobster roll was bland, lacking the rich goodness that should make that sandwich so tasty, and the cole slaw was fundamentally sliced cabbage with mayo with a little sugar thrown in for good measure. Even the locally produced ice cream was scarcely discernible as peanut butter pie, its purported flavor.  My husband's french fries were good. That much we can say.  Overall, the restaurant reminded us of country club dining: overpriced mainstream and bland offerings amidst a homogeneous clientele. It was the Wonder Bread of upscale Charlotte dining, and in my many years of Charlotte living I can promise you better choices are literally down the block from Bricktop's.",

When I come with friends we sit at the bar and enjoy excellent cocktails and with the kids we sit outside and play games with our kids.   They can run around in the courtyard while we have a cocktail.  Its a little disappointing that we are there constantly and no one has ever recognized us, I like it when restaurants recognize and welcome their regulars.

The sauteed spinach was delicious too with lemon zest and a hint of garlic. My friend enjoyed the Scottish salmon and was equally impressed with his dinner.

I went in wearing jeans, and well I can say we stood out. But who cares?  I ordered the ribeye. It melts in your mouth with a little bit of tanginess, and at the same time sweet. It was quite an experience. The loaded stuff potatoes was a little over the top. I should have ordered the Mac n cheese, but sadly I didn't do that.   Another honorable note is that their croutons are absolutely amazing. They melt in your mouth just like the rib eye. I believe they hand make them as well.",

Service was amazingly attentive, but not overly so, as they sat my friend and I for dinner. I chose a sushi appetizer (which I never knew they offered) AND IT WAS AWESOME. Their sushi menu is limited, but very good. For my entree I picked the Prime Rib with loaded potato and the Prime Rib was huge and a perfectly cooked medium rare (just the way I like it) and the potato was loaded to the sky and tasted amazing. A great meal and very affordable based on the portions provided.",

    "text": "Bricktop's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Their entrees are light and flavorful, and they have great wines. They have a great patio and heat lamps in the winter, so we frequent that area. The lunch crowd is always busy, and so is dinner - so you know it's good. We never have trouble getting a spot, and if so we will just sit at the bar. The staff is usually very attentive and nice. The flavors and pairings are all good for the specials and regular food. I believe sushi is a newer add, can't vouch for it, but literally never had a bad meal here. Tried fish, chicken, steak and crab/tuna salad which is my absolute favorite. I love that I'm always satisfied but not overstuffed after leaving. It's also very classy, but not fine dining expensive, so it's a good balance. Can't recommend you go here anymore than I have, you shouldn't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Fancy restaurant that fits right in to the very spendy Southpark neighborhood. Starting with two hostesses to greet, a large and well decorated dining area, white table linen and three staffers to take care of our table (one who did nothing but refill water glasses). If you're looking to impress, this will get 'er done.  We started with the goat cheese bruschetta which was more like a small goat cheese and veggie pizza as you'll see from the picture. Which isn't to say that it's not really really tasty and quite filling. You could easily have this as your main course.  But we didn't. Today was a \"salad\" day. I went with the Cobb, my wife had their \"Florida\". Both were good portions of protein and were very flavorful. Interesting plating for the two salads. They must put them into a cylinder of some sort where they build the layers and then \"flip\" it onto the plate. It looks pretty.  My only complaint is that while there was blue cheese in the salad, the dressing on the side was a balsamic and oil rather than a blue cheese dressing itself.  $14 for the pizza... I mean bruschetta and $18 or so for each of the two salads. A little expensive for a late lunch but it was quite good and I'd recommend it.",

Menu is 1 page (True example of do less amazingly)   Most popular not to be missed appetizer is eggs & bacon.  Perfect for 2 people to share.  Great twist on a traditional favorite.  They have my favorite salad dressing called green goddess but this didn't come out of a squeeze bottle.   I have had many items on the menu that does change from time to time.  Don't hesitate on the Pork Chop the flavor is superb & it's a great portion.  The half chicken is a little crispy outside but juicy on the inside.  If you like fish then order the grouper it'll make you an instant fan! My favorite go to is baby back ribs.  Fall off the bone with a tangy sweet sauce that is finger licking good! Don't worry hot towel is on it's way! They have shoestring fries that compliment every dish & the loaded baked potato is a generous size & heaping in \"loaded\".  Lol we never have room for dessert. Lol in the warmer days get there early to sit out on the patio.  Make a night out of it! ENJOY!",

White table cloth and kinda fancy but not at all pretentious.  The service is excellent.  I wasn't super hungry so I opted for ahi salad which was perfectly delicious with mango and jicama. Yum!  The kids were impressed with their food (cheeseburger and grilled cheese) but apparently the fries were the best they'd ever had! My husband had the ahi burger which he enjoyed as well. Because l went light on lunch I indulged with dessert!  The bread pudding is DELICIOUS!!!  We will definitely be back for dinner soon.  I only took one star away because it is a bit pricey for what you get but the food is certainly good.",

(Why do they do that? Give the first diners a great seat please!!)    Ordered a salad and it was swimming in dressing which I would have asked the waitress to replace if she'd come back around.  She didn't, so I ate it. I used to love the TROUT with capers and lemon butter.  The trout now has crab and brown butter.  It was over cooked and dry (no sauce). I wouldn't order it again. We never saw the waitress until she offered dessert.  One guy dropped off water but the service was lacking.  If it wasn't my birthday I would have asked for the manager.   Soooo disappointed! Spouses salmon and spinach were great as always.",

Our initially friendly waiter turned out to be incompetent...or perhaps it was the combined team? Salads arrived before appetizers. Appetizers arrived a few minutes later, crowding the table. Entrees arrived 1 minute after the appetizers. We obviously sent entrees back, where they must have sat under a warmer until served. Ribs were okay but luke warm and broccolini was hard as a rock. To top it off, the waiter came running after us outside the restaurant accusing us of failing to sign both receipts. We encouraged him to go back and check...where he ultimately found both and gave a weak apology. This while other diners leaving the restaurant glared at us.  It will be LONG time before we return.",

We also split the pizza with the beef, cant remember since its been a bit if it was short rib pizza? It was good, felt like it could have used a little less cheese and some sort of sauce... maybe a drizzle of BBQ on the top and that would have really kicked it up.

The atmosphere is nice, not very french ( and I've been to france). There are big bottles of Veuve Clicquot in the front when you walk in, very inticing. The first time I visited, i went for lunch. I take a late lunch ( around 2 pm) and they were still a little busy and a little slow. But my waitor was great and I scored some free fries! They were great, \"skinny', just the way I like them. I ordered the roasted chicken (half chicken) wich was about 16$ and I ate on it for days. It was seasoned well and juicy. The jus was sooooo good. I had spinach as my side which had a smokey flavor to it and parmasean (I think). My lunch guest had the salmon with spincah...Amazing, flavorful, and moist. The second time I visited was for brunch. Saldy, they were out of blood orange mimosas. So I opted for the Rosemary Grapefruit soda. Amazing choice. We started with the donuts that came with three dipping sauces. Chocolate, Raspberry, and Creme Anglaise (my fav!). They were delicious!! I ordered the French Toast with caramelized bananas, whipped cream and a side of bacon. Huge portion!! My guest orded Steak and Eggs, she said it was cooked perfectly. And of course we had frites!!! I will definitely be visiting this place again.",

The lobster bisque was as wonderful as when i was paula deans lady n sons :)  There was not just tiny pieces of lobster there were big pieces.  The flatbread very light, not heavy so to spoil you for your entree.  the crusted chicken w/ tomatotes and capers wonderful.  My freind had the ribs, they fell right off the bone, i tried one they melted in your mouth.  For desert the hot fudge sundae very light just enough to get that sweet for the ending of your meal.  I will be back to bricktops , service was great an staff was so friendly :)",

I used to work within walking distance and it was my go to place for lunch when taking out clients... they were always impressed with the menu choices and decor.  I don't care what a restaurant looks like, but you know how clients are...  would rather have a pretty meal than a good one.    Just kidding, clients, love you forever!  Please keep sending me big checks!  By the way, have I told you that you look great today?  wink, wink...  On different occasions I have tried their crab salad, chicken sandwich, fish special, artichoke dip, calamari, and burger.  I found the food to be pretty good, simple and seasoned well.  I'm not a huge  fan of what the kids call \"New American\" food, but I thought this place was good.  Apologies if I am using the term incorrectly...   I have noticed that people give it good reviews for lunch and bad for dinner... may want to skip it at night.",

Last night, my sister and I  treated ourselves to the  grilled artichoke to start and then, per usual, I ordered the fish tacos. The blackened fish of the day was Mahi Mahi and paired with fresh guacamole, white cheddar and brown  rice, they were amazing. There is pretty much nothing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend.

    "text": "Great brunch! Started with the donut appetizer - the vanilla, chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces are great - but the donuts are also delicious without any sauce. I ordered the crab benedict and my husband ordered the chicken and waffle. As soon as noon rolled around the bartender brought out my Bloody Mary. I was disappointed that the only garnish was a lemon wedge, I'm a big fan of traditional (and creative) Bloody Mary toppings. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the mix (not sure if it's homemade.) My husband enjoyed his chicken and waffle, but had to remove a huge melting pond of butter from the middle of the waffle. My crab benedict was fantastic as well, well poached eggs atop an English muffin (homemade?) with a generous pile of lump crabmeat. I especially liked the hollandaise sauce which was particularly lemony, which complemented the crabmeat well. The roasted potatoes that came with the meal were perfectly cooked, soft insides and crispy outside with great seasoning. The food was a little on the pricey side, so we won't be regulars, but it was a terrific meal. Our server was a bit too nonchalant and actually left the wrong table's check with us at first, but everything came out as we ordered it and the food was delicious, so we'll overlook it.",

Very warmly greeted when first entered and given a table immediately (we had reservations but you never know how those will go HAHA). Anyway, our server was very nice. They were pretty busy as it was a Sunday morning and we had a bit of a delay with the food. We tried the guac and salsa appetizer and it was really good. I had a blueberry waffle with fruit but the waffle comes warm and had a lot of butter on it which I tried to remove (I didn't want it too soggy) but it still got the middle of the waffle pretty soggy. It also didn't come with syrup so I had to ask for that separate but that was no big deal. My sister got one of the salads but mentioned that it was soggier than usual (with dressing) and she thought it was only so-so. We tried the doughnuts for dessert and they were covered in sugar so super sweet. Good idea though, who doesn't love dipping food in chocolate?!",

We started with spinach artichoke dip which was bland and boring for 10.00. The bartender was ok she dint ask if it was good or not and after two bites I decided not to waste my calories. Next I ordered the lobster roll figuring what was the special had to be good. My husband had a crab salad with shrimp and avocado. When my lobster roll arrived it was on a hamburger bun???? With sesame seeds? The lobster was ok blah completely not quality of 19.00 no one asked if it was ok.  I ate half and she took my plate. My husband salad had so much avocado and hardly any lettuce. I definitely will not waste 60.00 for lunch here again. What a bad choice!",

    "text": "This is a 4.75 star review.  I have had lunch and dinner at Bricktop's many times and have never been disappointed.  Please be aware however, I do not stray far from a few favorites on the menu.  Their veggie burger is the best I have had in Charlotte.  Their chicken tenders are also the best (no, I am not a 7 year-old child.)  Their salads, soup specials, and vegetable features are also top notch.  The deviled eggs and sugar bacon appetizer are VERY popular and delicious.  Where I dropped the review 0.25 stars is for price.  The restaurant is not the least expensive for lunch; BUT, in Southpark, nothing is inexpensive.  Parking availability is limited in front of the restaurant and additional parking is available throughout the retail area.  Where I am most impressed with Bricktop's is their service.  Granted, I am a regular, but I have always appreciated the teamwork of the professional servers.  It takes a village and Bricktop's has well-trained the Team to help each other.",

It had to be close to my grandmothers ....dad wanted a big portion (as I prefer small plates so we did a lot of that for the majority of the weekend) ...and mom is super picky in the food department.  We finally decided on South Park and after circling for quite some time we let my dad make the executive decision. My dad walked into our first stop (Bricktops) and noticed the cranking AC and Prime rib and decided this would be our eating destination.   I had a salad and the pr special and felt both were pretty delicious considering how hungry I was. The twice baked potato had enough salt, butter, and cheese to qualify it as heart-attack inducing but tasty none-the-less! We spoiled ourselves and had dessert, I really enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie sundae thing and the key lime pie garnered rave reviews from the rest of the table.   Service was really great, I must say. Our server was on top of everything and made great recommendations. Considering how busy it was I was impressed.   Clean, beautiful, bright food ...it is not. Stuff your face on fathers day ...it is. I'm not sure id go back on my own but I wouldn't be against having another one of those twiced baked potatoes (following a long gym session!)",

    "text": "Bricktop's is tucked away behind SouthPark Mall a block away from where you think it is. -- To wit: not behind Walgreen's. Any time I go west on Morrison from Sharon, I'm heading to the Mall and turn left before I get to 6401. Heaven forbid you should go to Bojangle's instead! (shudder!)   I entered in the mood for a cheeseburger and I successfully resisted the temptation of a very good-looking menu.  But oh! What a burger! I was told by our waiter that since they ground their own beef, I could get it close to the rare the nanny state won't allow us to have.  It came to the table in like two minutes, dripping with hot, juicy deliciousness. So juicy, in fact, that it soaked the bun into a soggy, doughy mess. Halfway through, I discarded the remains of a once-crispy toasted bun and finished off the piece of cow with my fork.  Friends, that cow died a noble death in a worthy cause.  Even the humble French Fries were remarkably tasty. I'm a light eater and usually get two meals from any restaurant. Not this time. I almost whacked our waiter's knuckles when he politely reached to remove my plate. I was sitting, talking, sipping, and enjoying the feeling of being comfortably full, but still nibbling at my fries.  Rita had the deviled eggs and sugar bacon. The eggs were good, but the bacon was de-freakin-licious!  The drinks were strong and plentiful. My wife's favorite pet peeve is a Martini that only fills half the glass. A cheap bar will short you two thirds of a drink that way. Any place that serves you a third of a Martini is probably cheating you other ways, too. This one was full to the brim and frosted.  My rum and Coke was strong enough to rise up and walk across the table by itself. The well liquors are good, too. No need to call.  Our servers, trainer and trainee, were never more than a glance away. As he walked through the dining area, his eyes would track right and left. We were always able to catch his eye.   I hate giving five stars! I really do. But they didn't do anything wrong!  I'll be back to give them a chance to lower their score. That's fair . . . right?",

    "text": "For the longest time, I was under the impression that Bricktops was a pizza joint, albeit one of those \"upscale\" ones where they smother your wood-fired pizza with food stuffs that simply don't belong on a pizza. Salmon? Are you kidding me?   But I was mistaken, and gladly so. I was pleasantly surprised with Bricktops upon my first visit, and I've been there 3 times since. And each time I've eaten at Bricktops, my dining experience has been better than the previous time.   My first time, I popped my cherry there with a cheeseburger. I figure if you can't screw up a cheeseburger, then you're likely to know what you're doing in the kitchen. Bricktops passed this test with flying colors. One of the best cheeseburgers in town, no joke, and complimented pleasantly with a very generous serving of shoestring fries. First visit, color me impressed.  Second time around, my family and I dined there on New Year's Eve. A bit of trepidation surrounded my dining experience at first; I've been to several NYE dine-ins that have been nothing short of awful because of the importance of the holiday and a stunning lack of planning on a restaurant's management's part. But not at Bricktops. Reservations were honored without fail, our meal prepared with the utmost attention to detail and taste, and our waiter was very friendly and attentive, despite the buzz and the clamor in the air. I opted for the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was wonderful. Nothing beats chicken so tender you can fork it. My wife chose a New York Strip, Pittsburgh style, which she thought was very delicious. I sampled a couple of bites. Unbelievably tasty. My daughter loved her salmon and noodles, and for eating her plate clean, she was rewarded with a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Not just frozen, store-bought ice cream, but fresh-churned ice cream, the vanilla tasting of real vanilla bean. I can't say who enjoyed this more, my daughter or me.  Last visit there, I chose the veggie burger. Pardon my french, but HOLY SHIT, that is one spectacular veggie burger! Listen, just run there right now and try it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  A word about the Deviled Eggs & Sugared Bacon: what you've heard about this sinful delicacy is True. You can't just eat them. You find yourself DEVOURING them. Order a plate for you and your sweetie, and a fight for the last strip of bacon and the last sliced egg may break out, and it's gonna get ugly. So order two plates, one for you and one for him/her. Your relationship will be the better for it.  After 3 visits - and possibly a fourth coming this weekend - I can easily make the claim that Bricktops has become my favorite, go-to eatery in the Queen City, replacing my one-beloved 131 Main.",

The chocolate chip cookie is on the bottom with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzled all over.  When biting into the cookie it tasted like a homemade cookie.  It was soft and melted in your mouth.  The cookie wasn't over cooked at all.  The ice cream adds a cold mix to the hot cookie.  The caramel is a perfect topping because it doesn't make the dessert to chocolaty.  The desert cost about $6 and it is worth every penny.  The service is great and I would recommened going to Bricktops, there flat bread pizza, hand made veggie burgers and fries are all really good.",

Restaurant Week is a busy time for many of the nice places in Charlotte, but we were treated to the superior service and fabulous food we have enjoyed in the past, even though it was Restaurant Week and they were very busy.  We were not rushed at all, the food was perfectly cooked and we had a relaxing and enjoyable meal.  PLUS, we could hear each other speak at the table.  We could actually have a conversation!  This is so rare today with all the restaurants doing nothing to quiet the sound.  I would pick Brick Tops any time we want a nice meal out with friends.  Absolutely loved it and so did our friends who had never been there.  I will sing their praises to anyone who will listen!",

Crab cakes, that we normally love were made with not so fresh crab. Snapper was over cooked and broccoli was cut in HUGE, old and yellowing florets. It was inedible. Only good thing tonight was the grilled artichoke with aioli.  We probably won't be back any time soon, after enjoying this place for years. As we left, we walked past the beverage station that stunk of old, stinky wash rags. Yuck! Time for this place to clean up its act, but based on the automatic biz from the old folks crowd and hotel neighbors, doubt they'll even try. What a shame. So disappointed!",

When we arrived, we were concerned with the noise because of a significant number of families, but when we were seated, we had a nice table in the back of the restaurant.   The only negative of the restaurant was parking.   Everything else was incredibly positive.   Nice pace from the server. Never rushed. Never wondering where he was.   Had the Beet/Goat Cheese Salad - split it (no additional charge). It was very nice and light.   My wife had the filet and creamed spinach.   I had the NY Strip and Fettuccine Alfredo.   Then, we split a baked potato...  Wow...we were so excited about the food. My wife said it was the best steak she had eaten in some time.   We ended our meal with the bread pudding. I've had bread pudding all over the world. This was among the best. The sauce and the creme anglaise were perfect. What an ending to a great evening.   It's noisy, but just enough so that you don't think people can hear your conversation.   It's casual enough to feel comfortable, but nice enough for our anniversary.   We will return.",

She said it was ok and the fries were the best part of her meal.   The Cream of corn - for me, was practically the only saving grace to this place.   The manager Jamie Stegall, was very apologetic. Also a saving grace to the whole experience! She was sweet and offered to bring anything else with no cost. She sweetly packed up some cream of corn to go with her card to receive a free dessert the next time I come.",

This time, we took a newbie friend with us, and she said \"how have I never been here before ... this place is amazing!\"  For appetizers: you absolutely have to get the deviled eggs & millionaire's bacon. The eggs are probably some of the best in the South, and the bacon is basically candied/glazed ... all the NOMS.  Entrees: My go-to is without a doubt the baby back ribs. They're so tender they just drop right off the bone. You get a huge rack, probably about 12 bones or so. More than enough. The ribs come with fries & cole slaw. I'm not a huge slaw fan, so I always sub it out. GET THE MAC N' CHEESE. Seriously, it's insanely good. The crab cakes are also amazing --- great size and huge chunks of fresh crab. My wife and I didn't really care for the quinoa-kale salad too much that it came with ... but to each their own. You can't go wrong ordering either of this. My wife and I usually get these and split our dinners to get the best of both worlds. If you're more of a chicken person, the Parmesan crusted chicken is incredible and the service size is insane ... easily two meals worth.   Alright, stop reading and make your reservations now!",

To save you time, start with the deviled eggs appetizer.  I ordered the eggs because I have never seen a restaurant brave enough to add a dish that is best remembered from a church potluck - what's next ... tater Tots casserole?  However, I was rewarded not only with tasty eggs, but with a candied bacon (they call millionaire's bacon) that literally had me fighting my clients for the last piece.  We also ordered the Shangri-la roll which is a combination a spicy roll, a California roll, and a rainbow roll.  I don't care what you combine as long as it is delicious.  The last two times I have ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with a miso soy marinade.  You can't go wrong here and it is buttery as the best sea bass I have had, but my table mates steaks also looked amazing.  We finished off with a chocolate chip cookie which is served warm in a cast iron pan with some ice cream on top.  Definitely check out Bricktops if you can get a table.",

I ordered the recommended crab cakes and the bf ordered the tuna. The cakes were amazing as I was told they would be and the tuna just ok.

My mom makes just as good or better, but these are still worth it.   The Bel Air Benedict comes with a thick sliced tomato, a good amount of fresh avocado and a poached egg on an English muffin and topped with hollandaise. The hollandaise was a bit thick and not lemony enough for my taste, and the egg was cooked a little too much (most of the yellow was hard), but overall the combination of flavors worked.  The home fries served with the Benedict were salty and seasoned and crispy.   The French Toast with caramelized bananas and maple syrup was the perfect sweet counterbalance to the Eggs Benedict. I appreciated that the syrup was real maple and the butter was real butter. (Sad how often that is not the case.) If possible, I recommend sharing 2 dishes to get the best of savory and sweet.",

It was nicely decorated inside with a modern, upscale vibe, but comfortable enough that you could still dress casual (but not too casual).  We didn't have a reservation, but we were seated within 10-15 minutes.    The menu is basically \"American\" food; there didn't appear to be any other theme to it.  We started out with the deviled eggs and sugar bacon appetizer, only because it sounded unique and certainly not something you see every day on a menu.  The eggs were good, but nothing special about them.  The sugar bacon was basically dessert for us.  Wow.   Tasty, but oh-so-sweet.    None of the entrees -- basic steaks, chicken, fish -- really jumped out at me, so I went with the Ahi Tuna Burger.  It was quite a fabulous sandwich, topped with a ginger dressing slaw (lettuce, carrots; no cabbage thankfully).  It was full of flavor, and I enjoyed every bite.  I chose fries as my side item, and they were thin slices of fried potato with a delicious coating.  I enjoyed them, too!  It was a good dinner experience and I'd recommend it for people who like a great meal but don't like anything too crazy food-wise.  I'd call it a nice \"meat and potatoes\"-type restaurant.",

The fella and I took our first trip to BrickTop's on a Wednesday night; the main reason we went was because they were one of the few places NOT doing Restaurant Week.  We made an 8:00 pm reservation and were greeted and seated right away when we got there at 7:50.  The place was a little more fancy than we'd expected; it felt like a 131 Main or Vine to me with the dark wood, gauzy lighting fixtures overhead, and numerous booths.  We had a view of the bar from where we sat, and it looked pretty inviting and a little swanky.  Our waitress was prompt, engaging and friendly.  We started with the deviled egg & sugar bacon appetizer ($10), which was good, but not as great as I expected.  The sugar bacon was super chewy, but the eggs were good - almost sweet as opposed to vinegary like most deviled eggs.  I can't knock off points on the bacon though because... well, it's bacon.    For dinner, I got the Parmesan crusted chicken ($22) with lemon butter sauce and capers and a baked potato for my side, and the fella got the prime meatloaf (which was more like a large cone of delicious meat) and a side of the Cinderella whipped potatoes ($22).  The chicken was the best thing I've eaten in a loooong time with a buttery, delicious sauce, and then I tried the meatloaf.  Then THAT was the best thing I'd eaten.  The fella and I usually like to play \"who got the best dish,\" and I'm pretty sure it was a tie at BrickTop's.  With an appetizer, bottle of wine, and two entrees, our total bill WAS a little pricey ($90ish + tip), but I don't mind paying to get a really good meal and service, and that's what we got.",

Sit at the bar or on the expansive patio.",

If you decide to go for lunch they serve several types of stacked salads which are a fun twist on an otherwise simple meal. Regardless of the meal I am there for I enjoy the variety of fish dishes they offer and light vegetable sides. The burre blanc sauce they offer is a great addition to the perfectly cooked fish dishes.   The raspberry martini is a great decision if you are adding a cocktail. It has a perfect balance of sweet to cut the liberal pour of vodka.   Sometimes the service is a bit slow but that's understandable considering how busy they get!",

Their Chicken Milanese is also delicious. My only complain would be that I wish they'd give you bigger portion of potatoes.   The afternoon got even better when our dessert arrived. A delicious bread pudding covered in a vanilla run sauce. Wow wow wow!   We will definitely return and if they are consistently good this could be our \"go-to\" restaurant.",

We have had date night, large group and group parties and celebrations here. Our friends & family now love Bricktops too! I hate that they no longer participate in restaurant week BUT we are still always in this place lol. Crab cakes are the BEST in town and I've had my share around Charlotte, no one comes close. I've tried many things on the menu and have not had one bad or disappointing item yet. Bricktops staff is GREAT and accommodating, especially when we do surprise group dinners (they'll keep the cake and the secret).   I recently chose to celebrate a new job at a close by restaurant (just to try it). After we were seated and experienced poor & slow service...my husband called Bricktops and they got us in within 15 minutes AND it was later in the evening (with a party of 8). Needless to say my whole crew up and left place 1 and enjoyed a wonderful dinner/experience at Bricktops!",

Best steaks in town... Oh the best pork chops in town.  Its all GREAT!  BUT, it's not all about the food.  HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE!  The service is more than over the top and separates Bricktops from EVERYONE.   Expect the unexpected and it happens at Bricktops every day. Want something that may not be obvious on the menu, ask... It may be yours, and likely will be.  The staff do not turnover, 5 -10 years tenure is typical at this wonderful place.  Why?  Everything is the BEST!  This is food and service done right!!",

In my opinion the steak Benedict had an odd taste. The roasted potatoes we ok. I had a taste of the shrimp and they were well seasoned. The highlight of the meal was watching the servers try to bring down a rain guard as it began to pour down outside.  The leftovers of my meal will be thrown out as no one at my home even wanted to give them a try. I probably will not be back unless it's by a friend's suggestion.",

We went during lunch on a Saturday, there was no wait and they were moderately busy.  The servers were wearing their Panthers gear l assume for the weekend.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an app, it was average.  I let the BF pick, honestly I wanted to check out the deviled eggs after all the reviews. Our entrees were the Palm Beach salad and a regular cheeseburger.   Oh my goodness, it was delicious! I had the palm beach salad, the presentation was beautiful I felt bad destroying it. I wish I had a pic to show.  It came with crab, shrimp, avocado, tomato and eggs. Very refreshing.  My BF ordered the cheeseburger, of course I sampled it.  The fries were amazing.  Not sure why they stole the show but they did.  They were better than hot fresh salted McDonald's fries.  I highly recommend those.  And for dessert we ordered the chocolate chip cookie. It was very rich.  A skillet baked cookie with ice cream and caramel sauce.  Also, on a side note I had the coffee with dessert too, it was very memorable. Very strong.  That may have been one of my favorite things.   I enjoyed Bricktops & would return.  Service was great, food was great.  The only concern was the price, it was on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for, right?!?",

We arrived around 12:30, and did not have a reservation.    This is a very busy place and I'd suggest a reservation and would make one next time- even for lunch!  It was a busy spot.  We were greeted by the hostess who informed us that it would be about a 30 minute wait.  The hostess was a bit snooty- but maybe she was just being focused at her job.  She could definitely smile more!  We were seated in the bar area at a booth after waiting around 20 minutes.  We started with an appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip.  It came with chips that seemed house made.  It also came with salsa which was very flavorful.  It was good dip but nothing out of the norm.  Lunch was a cheddar burger for me, and a Cobb salad for mom.  The burger was enormous!  Even big enough for my husband who always complains about the size of burgers at restaurants.  It was $14.  The Cobb salad has awesome presentation and was $16.  Both are pictured.  We finished up our meal with the cookie skillet... Which is much recommended! It was delicious and came with a huge scoop of ice cream with Carmel sauce- but we had it on the side.  It was $7.  The service was so-so.  We did not get checked on a ton considering all of the food and courses we ordered.  The bartender was our server and she did have a full bar most of the time, but maybe they should have other servers besides the bartenders during this type of volume.  The food was good.... The people we interacted with were ehhhhh.  The food made me want to return but I wouldn't say the service did.",

Nearly every table has guests, but there were always tables available for more. We will be back soon for the black bean and chicken chili!",

    "text": "My daughter took me here last night for my birthday (she's 19) we had reservations which was good because they were busy for a Wednesday night.  We were seated and greeted in a timely manner, I had a glass of wine already from the bar and my daughter ordered a sprite. We had appetizers of their bang bang shrimp, spinach artichoke dip, Caesar salad and lobster bisque. All was tasty except the Lobster bisque which has brandy in it.  It was fine for the 1st couple of spoons but after that it gets to be too much. My daughter ordered the NY Strip, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  Her steak was perfectly cooked medium and delicious, the sea bass had a sesame gravy like sauce that I did not care for.  The stir fry vegetables that came with it were great thought and very tasty.  I took only one bite of my sea bass.  I put my plate to the side. When the server asked us if everything was ok (at least 15 minutes after we had our food) my daughter mentioned I did not like my dinner. She asked if I would like something else like dessert (not another entry) I said sure because my daughter likes their key lime pie. The manager also came by to ask about getting me a dessert. The point is the sea bass was $38 yet you offered me a $7 dessert. The server was new and sweet but she didn't come back to refill my daughter's sprite till the end of the meal, didn't know what the Cobe steak was nor what was in the BG salad.  All in all, it was just ok",

Based upon this single experience, I think I'm in love.  :)  The restaurant was crowded despite it being a weeknight. I was impressed with the service provided and absolutely loved the food. I experienced the deviled eggs and sugar bacon that previous reviewers raved about. Their analyses were not in vain. Additionally, I had the prime rib and twice baked potato for my dinner entree. The steak was cooked perfectly and the potato required no modification of spice/dressings.   The restaurant is moderately priced, with most entrees in the upper teens and twenty's. However, the drinks are a bit pricey. I ordered a pineapple martini for $10. It was good, but not great... at least not for the price.  Overall, I give this place a rare 5 thumbs up!  :)",

I just felt like drinking and had a 2nd when I spotted the Key Lime Pie and had to have a piece. They brought out this huge piece of pie and I was a happy boy. The first bite made me even happier. It was a case of come near me or touch this pie and we will have issues. Delicious. Between my martini and the pie it was perfect evening. Next time I may have to try some food, but I will have my pie first! Great service, nice atmosphere a must stop.",

Yes, a friend of mine sang a pretty song about Bricktop's brunch and within days hubs and I flew over to this SouthPark staple for some goodness. Their brunchy menu is in similar style to their lunch and dinner menu - new American eclectic. Not only do they offer a make your own bloody mary bar, but they also host a variety of specialty drinks (think blood orange mimosas and bellinis by the carafe - NOM).   I've eaten the same tasty dish both brunch visits - the French Toast. Big toasty brioche slices with sides of caramelized bananas, warm maple syrup, fresh whipped cream and crispy bacon. It's delicious not at all nutritious and heavy on the portion for $11. Also, if you're feeling quite indulgent check out the bite size homemade doughnut starter - 13 sugar doughnuts with three dipping sauces (raspberry, chocolate and vanilla cream).   The brunch bill can get a bit out of hand here, especially when you start drinking your weight in mimosas, but it's worth it. Check it out!",

My wife ordered gluten-free for health reasons, but when her plate came out it was obviously not right since there were breaded onions on it. The manager quickly took it back and (we think) they prepared a whole new meal for her. It took a while, but to their credit, Bricktops did it right.

She then proceeded to go to the next table and I overheard the man tell her that he didn't want it now that his entree had already come out. The next incident was my meal came out, but not my boyfriends. The waitress walked by and said she would be right back to go check on it. It took 10 more minutes for his to come out after mine had already been served. My food was not hot. It came out luke warm. Although the food was tasty there are too many negative things that happened tonight for me to want to go back to this restaurant and spend the kind of money We spent. The restaurant wasn't even busy.",

Breaded to perfection, light and fluffy on the outside and juicy on the inside.   My side of sauteed spinach for both visits was awesome too!    Love  BTS location in the heart of SouthPark with a great patio, and welcoming decor.  Service is always top notch and good looking if I must confess!  Both of my recent visits were with large parties and the service never waivered each time.",

They also have some of the best sushi!! I go here now to get sushi instead of an Asian restaurant, my favorites are the Hollywood roll and the Dragon roll. Yum!! They have a beautiful patio, that can be heated and closed in or open and cooled which is perfect in any weather! The patio is where i enjoy my favorite drink (a specialty cocktail of their's) the Rosemary Greyhound! So delicious - must try- everything is good here! & The food is always consistent!",

Both were good, a little pricey but decent. I had the cheeseburger which was big and cooked the way I asked. Wife had the BBQ sandwich which she said was very good. I would eat here again but at the moment I'm not thinking about when can we go back. I wasn't \"wowed\". For the two of us the bill was $80 including tip. Pricey for a lunch of this calibre. Oh, had tea for the drinks",

I made the mistake of ordering the \"special,\" which was a tuna burger that tasted like they thought it up as a way to get rid of the ahi tuna that was no longer fresh enough to serve on the salad. A couple hours after eating it, I feel less than great. The deviled eggs, normally a highlight here, tasted almost as old as the cold bacon served with them. One of us ordered a turkey sandwich and couldn't even get through half of it.   Menu has not changed much in a long time. Some of the items, like the French Dip and Cobb Salad, are very solid. But you can't get those every time.   I give it two stars rather than one because it's been pretty ok (solid three stars) the other dozen times I've eaten here, but I wouldn't rush back based on today.",

Regular flies could be tolerated due to patio seating and the door swinging open frequently. However, fruit flies (we were seated by the bar) can only mean one thing. Back to the food. Everything was prepared very well. Coconut shrimp was excellent and the highlight item for us. Server was fantastic. Recommend highly.",

Our waitress, Kim was absolutely awesome. She suggested several different wine selections for us as well as brought samples out for us to try.   The only annoying issue we had during our visit were gnats!! I'm unsure if it were due to the weather or what, but we kept swatting periodically during our dinner.   Our dinner was amazing. Their beets salad is definitely worth trying. I ordered their trout entree, while my friends order the salmon and chicken entree.   All in all, we loved the experience, the food and service were excellent. Great restaurant for dates, celebrations, or a girls night out.",

Our server at first was great but then seemed to be bothered--we needed a couple extra napkins due to the pour, and she even joked we needed sippy straws--hard to get that first sip with the glass overflowing--oh well.  Again, the drink was made well, but service could use improving--maybe when too big a pour, give me a side car!",

    "text": "It was grandparent's day which brought on taking the 11 & 8 year oldsters to lunch.  We chose Bricktop's and this is certainly a classy and well run restaurant for lunch and dinner, as well as group events.  Bricktop's has that modern wood and glass restaurant off of a very sizeable bar.  A covered and heated sun porch is just off of the bar.  Booths are comfortable and there are also table seating and nice stools along the bar.  I will risk saying that it has a masculine feel, but not stuffy old school masculine.  Women will appreciate the classiness of the place.  Wait staff are wearing white shirts with ties along with long aprons.  Adds to the class.  Wife and I really did like the lunch menu.  It was full of dinner kind of items, along with sandwiches and salads. There was grouper, crab cakes, Ahi steak, salmon and trout for sea-foods.  Ribs, steak chicken entrees.    Appetizers were pretty neat.  Nice selection of items different from the stuffed jalapenos or mozzarella sticks.  Wife and I had grilled artichokes, three half's, with a dynamite aioli dip.  Heaven.  I had the lobster roll which was delicious and not skimpy on lobster meat.  And wife had a meaty French Dip sandwich which she could not finish.  The grandchildren had some good options from the children's menu, but opted for corn dogs and fries.  But their meal included both beverage and dessert.  Dessert was choice of chocolate or vanilla ice cream and they were very generous scoops.  They even had enough to share with us.  Service was great.  Adam 809 is one to ask for.  Kept us topped up with beverages and regularly checked in with us.  Nice guy, great server.  We four left happy.",

Today, I met my friend Dan and we were seated in a cozy booth next to the bar.  It was a spot that I could have occupied for hours because it was just so comfortable.  In fact, we were there for a few hours!   I had the chicken dish with yummy mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.   It was better than just five stars!   This was a refreshing lunch because it was full service, the food was served on real plates, and it was not a fast order at the counter experience.   We need MORE of these!   The price you pay may be a little bit more than the fast counter restaurants , but you really do get what you pay for!   Bricktop's has earned its reputation in Charlotte and If you haven't been here, you are missing out.   Three thumbs up!",

It had that cheap mystery lunch meat flavor that you would find in a bad taco and was more fat that beef. Since there was only about six ounces, mostly fat, I only got about two bites and that was more than enough to feel sick. At $28 a plate that's $25 too much.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice. It just isn't enough to make up for the bad food and outrageous prices!",

    "text": "I am a fan of the menu of this restaurant. The food deserves four stars but the service is 3 stars based on my two experiences there.   My husband and I really enjoy the food. We like the Deviled Eggs and the Millionaire Bacon, the meatloaf, Chicken Milanese and the ribs.   We've had a mixed experience with the service. The first time we sat at a booth in the bar area and had FANTASTIC service. That server really set the bar high for subsequent servers. The second time we dined we ate in the dining room and  the service was adequate but not great. There was a couple sitting across from us and apparently the whole entire staff knew the woman of the couple and congregated at their table during our entire dinner which was  distracting because they were laughing and talking as if they were at a party.  With the restaurant practically full, I wondered how they had so much time to congregate. Did they not have other customers to attend to?  Our waitress was adequate but really busy and when  she came to our area, she spent a lot time chit chatting with the couple instead of checking on us at regular intervals.  She had various helpers bring items but  after our flatware was removed with our appetizer dishes, we had to request new  utensils. We had a hard time flagging our her down when we needed something, she  just always seemed in hurry. We had to request drink refills, they were not offered. We had to request bread, it was not offered. We felt like she was not attentive,  like  we were an afterthought, not really a priority. Also the timing was off on a couple of courses. My husband got his salad long after the appetizer but about two seconds before his entree.    Since the second visit was for my husband's birthday, I was somewhat disappointed that service was not as good as the first time. This experience did color my perception of the restaurant somewhat. I left my normal tip since service was not horrendous, but I was not thrilled with it either. Since we had a good initial experience,  I am willing to  attribute this to just a fluke.  I would come here again because of the menu. But if we experienced lackluster service again, I would be not be inclined to return.  Servers need to understand that good service adds to the quality of the experience. It is not just about the food. If I just wanted good food, I would do take out or cook at home. I want the the opportunity to relax, have good meal and be properly attended.  UPDATE: I did notify the management of this restaurant about the second visit. The manager acknowledged that he had had to speak to the servers about congregating at  the couple's table to chat before. Apparently, they are frequent diners at the restaurant and a lot of the staff know them. He apologized and sent a gift card to be used at a future visit. We had already decided that we wanted to return there at some point in the future- they have a brunch menu that looks good- so this was a nice gesture. But if we get seated near that couple again, I am going to ask for another table. :-)",

But mostly when we advised we were unable to finish our meals - he brought two boxes...we had to ask for bags to carry out and THEN he rushed my daughter asking: \"do you want that?\" Extremely disappointing I suggest management have him enroll in diversity training class. Hopefully he will learn that \"We All\" carry the same money and the color is GREEN! Will not return nor refer....",

The atmosphere is nice, relaxing, very country club-ish and so were the people on the day we were there. Everyone else was over 50 and it seemed like that kind of crowd. There was no background music playing, which was very noticeable.   The wait staff were very good, friendly, cheerful and quick. The menu looked delicious but the prices really didn't. My wife had the ahi tuna burger which was just the, ground up ahi tuna with fillers for $16. I had the French Dip sandwich which was good (but also $16) and the au jus had the distinct taste of butter. So much so that I thought the pasted baguette was buttered but it wasn't.  I don't think we'll be back. But hopefully other people will enjoy it. It just wasn't for us.",

Very good, I liked the chopped raw onion touch.  They even split it for us, no hassle.  BBQ Chicken Flatbread: 3.  Solid flavors.  They use cream cheese on it, which I didn't mind, but a few pieces had a little too much of it.  Veggie Flatbread: 4.  Good Mediterranean flavors, I preferred this to the BBQ Chicken Flatbread.  Ambience/Space:  3.5.  Casual & very comfortable.  They also have a nice outdoor patio under a canopy that would be great on cooler days/nights.    Service: 3. The employees were pleasant when dealing with us, but I sort of got the feeling they didn't want to be there.  Understandable, considering it was Labor Day.  No one enjoys having to work on holidays.  Side note: A waiter walked by with some sushi rolls that looked very good.  Will probably give them a try next time I visit Bricktop's.",

I have been meaning to try them out for awhile but just seem to forget about it!  Anyway, we were there during brunch hours and the menu was fabulous, not to mention the plates of fluffy french toast and waffles that we saw passing by our table...BUT, we didn't go with a typical brunch.  We both ordered burgers.  I don't feel like I have earned the right to review this restaurant since we ordered burgers only...no apps, no dessert, no drinks, nothing special.  BUT--I HAD to give a shout out to the burgers at this joint.  I had the veggie burger and it was a DELIGHT!  It was by far the BEST veggie burger I have ever had.....and I have had a TON of them.  The waitress told us they make everything fresh in house and it was so obvious.  The veggie burger had such flavor and it was so moist!  It was falling apart a little bit but I didn't really mind because it was so good!  It was served with their french fries which were thin cut and very good as well.    My husband ordered their cheeseburger and he put it on the list of his top 3 burgers ever!  He has several dives he goes to in NY for a good burger so the fact that this burger made his top 3 list is truly amazing and speaks volumes for this restaurant.   I CANNOT wait to go back and try more of their menu items because if they are getting the burgers right then I am hopeful that other things will be amazing!!!!",

Also had the lobster bisque and that was really yummy! For the entree, I ordered the crab cakes and substituted the cole slaw for a loaded baked potato. The crab cake had good flavor, but the portion was extremely small for $30 and the baked potato came out cold. One of my friends ordered the prime meatloaf which was divine!!!! The meatloaf was delicious! However it was a very small portion, it was more like a meatball instead of a loaf. She also ordered a side of mashed potatoes that tasted like instant potatoes; which wasn't that great, she also added a side of mac & cheese which was pretty good.  Another friend ordered fish tacos with a side of fries. The tacos were actually pretty good. Had nice flavor to them, similar to a blackened taste.  My third friend ordered the chicken Milanese; the chicken was crispy and tasted like perfection. However the dish was supposed to come with a side of Alfredo but the kitchen \"ran out\", instead of telling us that there wasn't any pasta, they just neglected to tell us and sent the dish out without it. Boo!  The last dish ordered was the bacon cheeseburger with fries . It looked really good but I didn't get a chance to taste it. Overall the food was pretty good but I would not go back because it wasn't worth the price.",

Also was disappointed they don't serve bread before the meal. Other than that, the food was spectacular. I tried lots of appetizers - tempura shrimp, spinach artichoke dip, and candied bacon were amazing. I had fish tacos with mahi mahi and they were to die for. The fish melted in my mouth. Peach Bellini was good, Mac and cheese was amazing, chocolate chip cookie and gingerbread were all perfect. Food was some of the best I've had. This place only lost points for no bread and small portion size for appetizers.",

    "text": "Stopped into Bricktop's for lunch one day so that I could use a gift card I had won.  Had never been, but a gift card is as good a reason as any.  We arrived at around 12:30pm on a weekday and here's your first pro-tip:  Dress smart.  We were all wearing jeans and we stuck out like a sore thumb.  Definitely more a business casual-type place.  We had to wait approx. ten minutes to be seated, but when we were, we were greeted warmly by our waitress.  She took our drink orders and gave us a run-down of the specials.  My co-worker and I decided on the fish tacos, while another co-worker went with the beef/mashed potato/carmelized onion flatbread.  It took about 15 minutes or so for our food to arrive, and while waiting, I checked out the jukebox.  It. Is. Awesome.  I queued up some MJ, Coldplay, Oasis, Verve, Bruce, Frank Sinatra, and Billy Joel.  Our food arrived and we dug in.  Two tacos came two to an order and the fish of the day (and everyday) was mahi-mahi.  The tacos were really tasty.  The spicy salsa was right on and there was some decent brown rice on the side.  My flatbread co-worker enjoyed her pizza, but found it to be a tad salty.  For dessert, we decided on the cookie.  Delicious.  And now I know why they keep it in the skillet (if they took it out, it would just ooze everywhere).  Bricktop's is a little outside of my normal price-range.  While the tacos were good, I don't know that they were $14.00 good.  On the other hand, I think that dessert is worth the $7.00.  I'll come back, but it will be a special occasion.  And rest assured, I will be kickin' out the jams on the jukebox!",

They have a Butter Crab Sushi Roll - yeah I'd never encountered such a sushi roll but let me tell you - I will again!  I have rarely EVER felt euphoria from eating many foods but that Butter Crab Roll is amazingly good! The Deviled Eggs w/ Millionaires Bacon- so, so good; Beet Salad w/ Goat Cheese and Rock  Shrimp Tempura, great. My cocktail, The Winchester and  new to the menu, was ... lovely!  Gin based with about 8 ingredients and a sprig of fragrant rosemary!  Though I did not try their steak or Ahi Tuna, my GF said it was great so I'm looking forward to getting my husband there for dinner on a day that does not exceed the normal heat index and we can enjoy the patio.  Our server was Dani ( thank you for the sushi suggestion!) and she was an absolute pleasure.   Money and time well spent!",

Other than feeling a little out of place everything was good.  I got the crispy chicken salad which came piled high in a cylinder shape. It was kind of odd, but different. Once my fork stabbed into it, the salad fell on the plate and mixed itself up. The chicken was in large chunks and the rest of the toppings were a good mix. I really liked it with the buttermilk ranch dressing.   Our waiter was really nice and sitting outside on a beautiful day was the perfect start to a great weekend.",

The sad thing about this place, is they have Zone Service and IF done correctly works well, but in this case the server takes my order writes down over easy eggs and then the cook ( yes not Chef) makes the eggs. gives them to what appears to be an expediter, who then gives them to a server (not our because of zone service) and serves them to me and not one person realized the eggs were hard instead of over easy. Well you may ask why the 3 stars, well I have been here for anything but eggs and the food has been good and the wife likes the food too and drinks are half way decent. There is a diner I go to who always cooks the eggs correctly and I am friends with the owner and I asked him how is it you see over easy and I get over easy but I go to this place and have never had them cooked correctly. He said I ask my cooks before I hire them, Do you like Eggs? Have you cooked eggs? he says that's the key, if they don't like them or cook them how can you make eggs for someone else. So is this the reason they can not cook eggs heck I dont know. I just know if you can not cook an egg you have problems and then to have the expediter and the server bring it out without looking if everything is correct and still serve it, hopeless.",

The place is quaint and awesome. I ended up Eating at the bar with one of my coworkers. The bartender was quick and attentive and made some recommendations off the menu. I was very happy to see that the menu had a lot of different choices depending on my taste for the night. Both me and my coworker ended up ordering the Aji tuna platter. It was outstanding.  The entire atmosphere and the feel for the restaurant was cool hip and modern. Menu was very good and I would highly recommend anybody stopping in here to order any of the food as it all looks great as it passed by us.",

I agree that this Southpark restaurant is indeed outstanding, beginning with its very professional dressed wait staff,  with men dressed in ties and black vests and ladies, in black dresses and white pearls.  The leather seated booths are also both stylish and comfortable. Most importantly, the food is exceptional.  Despite all of this,  it is still casual dining however and is a splurge for most of us (my wife's and my lunch bill with tip ran $67). Also sound the beverage price gouging alarm (soda and iced tea are $3), which is always a major gripe of mine.   We started things off with the highly recommended Deviled Eggs with Bacon appetizer for $10. It was a beautifully plated dish with six half deviled eggs around a mound of bacon, which was more like candy as it was encased in carmelized sugar and honey. I can see why it is so popular but it was a bit too sweet for us  My wife ordered the Lobster Roll with spinach at $20. The lobster was plentiful and tender. The spinach was perfectly prepared.   I went with the chicken and spinach dish for $16 which was an exceptional creation with two chicken breast halves pan seared and sliced thin served with a savory creamy white sauce. The creamed potatoes were unfortunately only lukewarm, a common problem. Overall though it was a great dish.   The $3 tea was also very good and refilled faithfully by our excellent server Adam. The bathrooms were clean and the sanitation rating was a 95 . A small dessert list is offered with choices at $10 each.  By the time we left at noon, the dining room was nearly full. I guess I wasn't the only one who read Michael's review. We'll defintely be back.",

The bacon leaves you licking your fingers from the carmelized sugar.   I was torn between the salmon and the Palm Beach salad. I went with the Palm Beach Salad and I made the right choice! OMG! The poached shrimp and crab meat on top of avocado looked as good as it tasted! The greens were on the side and the shrimp, crab and avocado were off to the side which caught me by surprise. I skipped the tomatoes because I'm not a fan. This salad was amazing.   I tasted a friend's side of creamed spinach and it was divine!  Too full for dessert.   Great spot and definitely worth a try!",

My girls and I had a 9pm reservation but didn't get there till 9:30!!!! They close at 10 but that wasn't a problem.  Our server(forgot his name) was extra helpful, gave us suggestions, which were on point and was pretty funny. The great think about it is when you're with a group each of you can order something different and take little nibbles off of each others plates and it's like you've tasted the entire menu....well at least that's what WE do!!! We had the tastiest drink called The Prickly Pear and it had just the right amount of alcohol, some said too strong but not for me!!!! Remember I said they closed at 10pm well we left at I believe almost Midnight and not one person complained or rushed us out. When it's good food , good drinks and great conversation, time really does fly by!!! Crap just remembered I didn't take pics of our food.  We had...

Bricktop's is a great semi-formal restaurant in Charlotte!! Most people think it looks like a sports bar from the outside, but trust me it's not! I absolutely love this place! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   The crab cakes are lush and full of crab, the Ahi Tuna is fresh and delightful, and the RIBS are a must! I would never actually get ribs out, but a few years back the server recommended that my husband get them. OMG they are amazing! They fall off the bone, and are so tender - full of flavor! They are a must. We get them every time!  And, most recently, we went here with my brother-in-law and his wife. He got the lamb chop, which can be dry, but not here. It was full of flavor and one of the favorite meals at dinner.  Plus, to top things off, service is always on point!  If you haven't tried Bricktop's yet, stop what you're doing and get here!",

I'm not a margarita fan or tequila but this wasn't half bad and it sneaks up on you like a thief in the night. Ok maybe not the best analogy but you get the point lol.  What's the next best thing that comes along with drinks other than.....drum roll.....OYSTERS!!! Decided to order oysters 2 wats, toasted and raw. Not a big fan of the roasted since i feel like it takes away from the natural flavors but hey it was an experience. The raw oysters were nice and fresh. I mean, you chuck them then serve not to much work there but have to admit they were on the smaller side than I'm use to. Another friend ordered the  Deviled Eggs with Bacon which i don't eat pork but he knocked them out pretty quick so i can only assume they were great. FYI they have sushi too so yeah that was also fresh and delicious.  With all these great things being said, my only critique would be the drinks. A friend asked for a mixed drink which he gave the bartender the ingredients but the execution wasn't the best.  Overall really great experience, the environment is very old school white collar but we met a few really cool folks at the bar so i recommend sitting their and mingling lol. Cheers!",

Get any meat from this place and you will not regret it. I ordered a slab of BBQ ribs and went straight to heaven. It was a bit spicey, but I like it that way. Stay away if you cannot handle spice. Nick, our waiter, recommended the best cocktail I have ever had - Basil Bourbon Blood Orange. I liked it so much I ordered 2 before the night was over. That was a first for me, but this was most certainly the start of many times returning to Bricktop's.",

Ample parking in front of a well lit area.   As you enter there is seating along the walls in front of the hostess stand with soft mood lighting.  I was seated in a booth in front of a TV playing a Houston Astros ballgame next to a bar with an extremely loud group of customers.    I had a great view of the retail shops from my vantage.  I indulged in a beet and goat cheese salad with vinaigrette  and Chicken Milanese.  It was all mouthwatering.  I ventured to request a dessert menu and had to refuse it when my waitress returned. There was absolutely no space for another bite.     This was an enjoyable evening all around.  When visiting again, I'll definitely return.",

My dirty martini did not taste good, clearly missing the dirty component and heavy on the vermouth (or whatever). A different bartender \"fixed\" it by re-mixing my drink with olive juice instead of remaking the entire drink. This did not make the drink better and, to compound the issue, no one took my food order after waiting for 10-15 minutes. Needless to say, I made a special trip over here for a martini and a certain dish and walked away extremely disappointed.",

    "text": "Ate at Bricktop's for a business dinner today and got to try a plethora of different things; overall I was a fan of the food but not super blown away. -BBQ Chicken flatbread: this was decent; the chicken was juicy and the barbecue sauce added good flavor but the flatbread wasn't that crispy and flopped under the toppings -Tempura shrimp: very crispy on the outside but the shrimp were still juicy. The sauce was similar to bang bang shrimp from Bonefish/ Cheesecake Factory and was very tasty -Spinach dip: came with tortilla chips and salsa; all pretty standard- not bad but just average -Millionaire's bacon: great!! Pretty sweet but the saltiness of the bacon still came through, everyone LOVED this at my table. -Simple greens salad: exactly what you would expect; good portion for a salad but WAY too much dressing for my taste (I asked for it on the side but received it poured all over the top) -Crab Cakes: highlight of my meal! The lump crab was awesome and didn't need a lot of spice/sauce because it was so good on its own. The coleslaw it came with was average and the portion was fairly small but the taste was on point. -Chocolate chip cookie skillet: topped with ice cream and a good end to the meal. It wasn't extraordinary but it was a warm baked chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream...you can't make it taste too bad -Key lime pie: everyone at my table thought this was WAY too tart and I agree. The graham crust was good but if you don't love key lime pie I would avoid for sure.   Our server was okay and the food took quite awhile to come out for each course, so I wouldn't advise eating here if you're in any sort of time crunch. Definitely a better place to relax and enjoy conversation without having to worry about being rushed out which is nice.",

Seriously, the food is decent and it packs a crowd but I am the only one here that thinks this place is overpriced? I was contemplating the chicken tenders with fries but priced at $18 I wondered if the waiter would cut it up and feed it to me as well. Sadly, he didn't so I settled for the burger which was cheaper. Price isn't an issue for me, I will spend the $$ on a good meal, but Bricktop's just doesn't justify it. For dessert I had the warm chocolate chip cookie a la mode. I love a good dessert! It was pretty large, but a little too chocolatey and why is there NEVER enough ice cream attached to a dessert? The ratio was 4:1 cookie to ice cream. :(  The decor was nice with large booths and the place fills up quickly. If you look around to check out the clientele it is a lot of ladies who lunch with too much botox. I had to ask myself, where am I? If you plan a trip to your dermatologist's office soon and still have some cash to blow, stop by Bricktop's.",

His dropping the card on the table must have been unintentional, as he and I discussed.  But after careful contemplation of the way he refused the Discover Card, I think it was a passive-aggressive act, although not a totally conscious one (perhaps).  Management, please take note.

Granted, I did dine during restaurant week which meant 4 courses for $30. But I would and will gladly come back as often as I can! The meal started with Tomato soup, followed by their sausage flatbread. Both were perfectly portioned and left me excited about what was next. The Ribs were fall off the bone tender, and sides of mac and creamed spinach were the perfect compliments. At this point were both stuffed and fully satisfied when the best looking skillet chocolate chip cookie EVER was sat in front of us. It's hard not to make room and it was worth every painful bite!   Considering it was a very busy time for the restaurant our experience there did not suffer one bit. We arrived on time for our reservation and were immediately taken to our seats. Our server was on her game and they even worked as a team to ensure every guest needs were taken care of.

Unlike most restaurant during restaurant week, you can actually choose from any entree on the menu for the $30 price.  The deviled eggs with sugar bacon appetizer changed my life! The sugar bacon is more like candied bacon...sweet, savory, and amazingly delicious! I could come here and only get the sugar bacon. I normally order the New York strip cooked medium which is prepared perfectly each time. The wait staff is friendly and attentive without being annoying.  They lost a start because they're serving flat soda! My last visit I order a coke and sent it back twice. Finally I requested water and told the waitress the coke was flat. She replied with yeah, we've been having issues with that for a while now. For some reason she charged me $2.50 for a flat soda I didn't drink!!

    "text": "We went to Bricktop's for lunch and had reservations. We arrived a few minutes late, but we were immediately seated and everyone was very friendly, courteous and quick to accommodate our lunch party.   Service - Definitely 5 stars! The waiters that attended to our table made sure we always had water filled, drinks being served and were very attentive to notice when someone was finishing up with their plate so it was quickly removed from the table. There was no pressure to order appetizers, dessert or anything if we didn't ask about it or want it.  Food - A solid 5! We had the deviled eggs/bacon, the shrimp and the guacamole/chips for our appetizers. All were served very fresh, full of flavor and the portions were perfect for appetizers. For our entrees I had the meatloaf with twice baked potato, another person had the fish tacos with spinach and another had the salmon with creme spinach. All three entrees were definitely a hardy sized portion, our food was delivered in a timely manner and all were cooked properly and full of flavor.  Parking - ZERO! Bricktop's is located across the street from SouthPark mall and in a shopping center beside William's & Sonoma where there was absolutely not enough spaces to accommodate the patrons, no valet service available, small parking spots and a very frustrating experience. Going in for the meal we were frustrated from having to search, wait and then park. Leaving we were frustrated as we tried to rush out of our place so the next person could park, get around cars sitting and waiting for customers in other stores and then simply an overall poor design of the parking lot.  Overall, Bricktop's definitely warrants a solid 4! I will return for the exceptional service, well prepared and great appetizers and entrees, but I will make sure I allow enough time to park over at the mall and then walk over to the restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here after work for a quick bite to eat at the bar with a buddy.  3 things stood out - none of them good.  1.  Don't be different in serving gin & tonic.  Served gin & tonic is a regular water glass, which was taller and narrower than what I'm used to drinking G&T out of--also regular straw dropped right in.  Looked like a sprite with a lime, if you ask me.  2.  Time the food service appropriately.  Enjoying the blue wedge salad for appetizer and didn't really get a chance to finish it because the main course arrived 6 minutes later... they had no awareness or were trying to rush us out of there.  Really disappointing that they tried to actively usher people out of there--more so when we're sitting at the bar.    3.  TUNA AHI BURGER SHOULD NOT BE MADE TUNA SCRAPS.  What a terrible, terrible menu item.  It was not a clean steak of tuna meat, rather, it was a TUNA PATTY.  I can appreciate that it was seared and raw, ONLY IF IT WAS TUNA STEAK.  How are you gonna use the leftover tuna scraps, make it into a patty, and only sear it?  It's very awkward item to eat overall--I'm pretty sure anyone that's had the tuna ahi burger here will not be getting it again.  It's more of a trap, in my opinion, where guests that order it \"fell for the trick\".    I will not be returning here.  If you are planning on going, then: (1) prepare to eat quickly; and (2) don't order the tuna ahi burger.    dmo out.",

We ordered the donuts for appetizer and it turned out the donut machine was having problems which was disappointing BUT the manager came by and said they would bring them to our table as dessert and it was on the house. Now that is the way to handle a restaurant issue. I digress, we ordered the french toast (three huge pieces with delicious caramelized bananas), eggs benedict, and shrimp and grits. They were all incredible. My only complaint is that we had to wait a while for the food but it was well worth it. Delicious meal.",

    "text": "Bricktops Restaurant is a casual eatery located across from the Southpark mall.  I have eaten lunch here on two occasions and both times my meal was pretty good.  My favorite menu items so far are definitely the amazing french fries and the delicious guacamole.  My issues with Bricktops really lie in the details.  First, do I really have to remind you to bring me a straw?   That drives me crazy.  Second, when I order a hamburger medium it should probably come with at least a tiny bit of pink on the inside - not charred all around.  I never send food back, but I was tempted this time!  I actually had to salt my burger - something I have never done before - because there was absolutely no flavor.  I ordered the bleu cheese burger and it came with bleu cheese on the top and caramelized onions on the bottom of the bun.  The onions were overpoweringly sweet and that did not help my poor charred burger taste any better.    However, on the up side... this place is very family friendly, and the entire staff is very nice.  It is the perfect place for a baby shower, a lunch with the girls or a business meeting.  We will definitely go back and hope for a better taste experience next time.",

Light, fresh-out-of-the-oven cinnamon sugar dusted mini doughnuts accompanied by chocolate, raspberry, and creme anglaise dipping sauces. Highly recommend to everybody.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, and the lady ordered the crab benedict, which Mattison kindly suggested adding avocado and tomato to.  I really don't want to type too much or else I might start drooling over my keyboard, but the chicken was moist and perfectly fried, the waffle was amazingly fluffy and flavorful by itself, and the lady's crab benedict had massive chunks of real crab with an amazing hollandai--- sorry, can't go on.  The service was awesome, the food was amazing, the portions were huge... after our brunch series is done, this will be somewhere we will be returning over and over again.

I wish I could tell you what to order specifically, but everything is absolutely amazing!! I will share some of my favorites with you.  Appetizers: the deviled eggs and millionaires bacon!! The bacon is thick cut and carmelized with amazing goodness. The smoked salmon is fantastic! I was shocked that it was served warm but this is my current favorite.   Meal: Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my all time favorite dish. The chicken is lightly pan fried with a fantastic lemon butter sauce and capers!!! Bistro chicken is blackened with the same sauce! This is a new favorite. Baby Back Ribs are fall off the bone. I can't share their secret, but they put some extra TLC into these.   Sides: Macaroni & Cheese! I have to have his every single time! Kale & Quinoa Salad is light and delicious. It's served cold which is very refreshing.   Last but not least, you have to order the skillet cookie!",

The dinner menu (including a separate sushi menu for that matter) offered one meaningful vegetarian choice, a goat cheese flatbread. It was decent, but hardly special, and by no means worth the $15 price. I suppose a lot of restaurants like this exist, and I only go to them when I get pulled in by a group that doesn't share my diet. Nonetheless, I could reasonably hope for better options.  Certainly, the low-light ambiance and the crowded strip-mall parking didn't enhance my opinion of the place either.",

Needless to say every visit has been extroadinary last night's visit kicked this place to a five star rating in my book. I called ahead and put my name in, for two, and was told 45 to 50 minutes. Upon arrival we checked in and headed for the bar. The bartenders were SO attentive and delivered water while we previewed the drink menu.  Wanting to try something new the bartender gave me her take on a few drinks so I went with the French Martini, vodka, chamboard and pineapple juice...Loved it!  My guest enjoyed a Cabernet. We enjoyed our cocktails and after 35 minutes were seated at a booth table in the bar.  Our waiter arrived and brought water and bread, wish was so warm and fresh, it just started the meal off perfectly.  On this visit I decided to indulge with the Crab Cakes and Mashed Potatoes and was able to also taste the Trout with Lump Crab Meat and Deviled Eggs my date ordered. The deviled eggs, how have I not ordered these before??? The creamy yolk was to die for.  As for the entrees, the trout was cooked too perfection with a creamy butter sause and large lump crab scattered on top. As for the crab cakes, they were too die for. All crab meat with VERY little filler. From the cocktails, service and food Brickop's is not a place to not check out. I look forward to getting back there soon!",

The bar itself is nice sized, and the service es muy bueno.  We had a great server!  We skipped appetizers this go around. But two things caught my eye - the deviled eggs and millionaires bacon, and the goat cheese flatbread - maybe on my next visit.  I had the blackened fish tacos and they were yummy! My friend had the Thai steak salad, I didn't taste it, but it smelled heavenly. And she got the kale and spinach side. It too smelled heavenly and the taste did not disappoint. I will try to recreate that dish for dinner. I think it will spice up my spinach. I noticed the grapefruit rosemary soda. I'm not a fan of grapefruit, but this item made me wish I was. My friend got it, and she loved it. So I have to put my thinking cap on. What fruit can I mix with rosemary infused simple syrup and make into a soda.  I would go again and I would recommend it.",

Reservations are not required, but highly recommended if you want a table in a timely manner.  The hostess said that they only reserve part of the restaurant, but based on how busy they were on a Wednesday night, I can imagine that wait times could get lengthy on the weekends.  I ordered a wine on the menu and was disappointed to discover that they did not have this wine, nor had they had it for the past 2 months. There wasn't a comparable substitute so I was left with the option of ordering a different (less preferred wine) or going without- gasp.  Of course, I went with the substitute as this was my first baby-free meal in a month.  I ordered the American Kobe Steak and it was amazing; my husband had the Scottish Salmon and he was also very impressed. Everything was well cooked and came out very fast given how busy the restaurant was. Very nice to be at a restaurant that has it together time wise. The chocolate chip cookie, comes out in a cast iron skillet and is to die for.  Seriously a must have and worth every calorie!  This is definitely an upscale restaurant- all of the staff were in all black, with pearls and red lipstick.  Everyone was very professional but slightly cold.  There was not a lot of personality nor did anyone really engage with us, heck, I would have been thrilled with a smile after the initial greeting.  Overall, the food made up for what the staff is lacking in personality.  We will definitely be back.",

Anyways after the hostess tried to sit 4 grown adults in a small booth we were seated in the main dining room. That was really the only hiccup of the day.   We arrived around 11:45 before the lunch rush, which if you come after 12:15 expect to wait. I ordered the steak and fries. That was probably the best decision I made all day. The steak was amazing. It had a garlic butter on it, and the steak for lack of a better term was butter. OMG. I picked at my fries, but wanted to save all the room for the steak. M. Steak.   Granted, if I was paying I probably wouldn't have picked the steak. For lunch it is a little pricey, but on the companies' tab I will take it all day.",

We started with the Deviled Eggs and Sugar Bacon. GOD was that awesome! There was definitely a sugar component to the egg filling, and it matched perfectly with the sugar bacon which was scrumptuous.  We both got a version of their supposedly FRESH Ahi Tuna, which the waitress said was flown in almost daily. Having lived on the West Coast I'm somewhat spoiled in what I expect out of Ahi Tuna. Well this was the real deal....as far as EAST Coast \"fresh\" Tuna goes. The quality was excellent, and the sear was perfect. Loved those sessame seeds on the oustside. My date's salad was very tasty as well, with the same tuna (albeit smaller in size).  No wine today. Just water. But overall a really excellent dinner experience. I will definitely be coming back!",

I have a lot of allergies (shellfish, peanuts, & nuts) and this is one of the few places I am able to eat the fries. They have their own frier and don't share oil with the shellfish. This alone is a huge plus to me. Plus the fries are amazing and perfectly crunchy.    All the food at this place is amazing. I came once when I met up with my old coworkers and another with friends who were visiting. All my friends Saint the place was \"on point\" and a \"great decision\". This will definitely be one of my go to places in the future.    The staff was also great and super attentive. I can always tell how good staff is when the manager comes and speaks to me personally about my allergies and to make sure I can eat what I want to order.   Highly recommend to everyone!",

We started with the deviled eggs and bacon which I am not a egg fan but they were really good and the bacon was great ! I ordered the Bistro chicken with mash potatoes and spinach. The entree was delicious and the chicken was tender. The only complaint was it seemed to be a little salty for me. My parents had the sea bass and the meatloaf. They both enjoyed both entrees. I think this restaurant will be in our regular rotation !",

We were staying across the street and the parking lot was full, so one of these restaurants has to be the draw. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome! She even heard me when I told my partner that the drink was too sweet and offered to fix it. I ordered the chicken strips as I didn't want a full dinner. That and I thought everything was a bit pricy. not for the quality of food that is presented to you! The strips were juicy, plump and crispy. But not greasy. And there were 8 huge pieces. the shoestring fries were golden and cooked to perfection. Now the slaw was in a world of it's own. Thinking that this is the best I have ever had. Creamy but not to spicy and crunchy. Yum, yum! Of course when I saw the huge slice of key lime pie my friend had. I had to get my own. (There will be no touching the dogs bowl in this group) The atmosphere was delightful, as well as the service. Great find!",

It was a Saturday night and insteading of waiting for a table my friend and I decided to eat at the bar.  She had a cheeseburger and I had a ahi tuna salad and a few beers.  Food quality was great, but the service, which was good in the beginning, fell way behind after or initial order.    The bartender got our initial order....by the way I was the only one drinking alcohol...a draft beer, so one could see my glass was empty from a distance............unfortunately the bartenders passed by over and over and over never asking if I wanted a refill.  I eventually got another beer, but by that time dinner was just about completely eaten.  Its a beer folks.....only service can screw that up....and bricktops did just that...at these prices I'll look for other locations close by to give my money to in the future.",

We even had to ask the waitress to repeat herself several times because we couldn't hear her over the noise.  I am getting older but I don't need a hearing aid yet.  Ordered guacamole appetizer and with first bite a warning signal went off.  There was no taste to the guacamole.  Only a slight taste to the salsa.  The chips were greasy and so we ate very little of a $9 appetizer.  No need to consume considerable fat grams on something with no taste.  My wife ordered chicken.  I ordered salmon.  Just like the appetizer, neither had any taste.  The mushrooms came in a separate bowl swimming in grease and cooked in wine.  The wine taste overpowered the mushrooms unfortunately.  Cost $56 to eat a tasteless meal.  I could have put that money in a jar to save for my hearing aid.  The only positive thing I can say about this restaurant is the service was quite good despite them being very busy.  It is conveniently located across from South Park Mall.  We were so unfulfilled that on the way home we stopped at Cook-Out and got a chargrilled chicken sandwich that had much more flavor than what we ordered here.",

    "text": "I had high, rooftop hopes for Bricktops but these hopes were flushed away down a porcelain downspout like the meal I had five hours earlier.  Atmosphere - A modern designed room that has maple tables w/ cloth chairs, booths w/ red brick colored leather (or pleather) seats and copper accents throughout.  Service - Service was excellent.  The restaurant was slow and our original server was switched to a new one w/out explanation.  This was kind of odd but we did not ask why as the new server was cheery, helpful and refilled my tea numerous times.   Food - It was early dinner time so I was not looking for a big heavy meal and based on a suggestion from the server I had...da, da, daaaa,...the prime rib sandwich!!  This sandwich seemed like a great decision at the time but later took me to foreclosure and back.  The condemned medium rare misaligned roof meat was stacked high on a fine crusty, buttered and toasted sandwich roll which I dipped its' shingles into a French Onion soup tasting repossession au jus.  For dessert I had the \"Chocolate Chip\", which was a warm cookie in a skillet w/ vanilla ice-cream.  I determined it was either the meat on the sandwich or the sauce that got me sick as the dessert was shared w/my date and she did not suffer the same torture I went through around 10 PM that night.    Overall - The place left me feeling like a fool because about 4-5 hours later it left me feeling like I had a putty knife in my stomach...and this roof was ready to fall.  Once I evicted what was present I immediately felt relieved.  How do I know this is what got me ill?  Well the last time I ate that day was at 9 AM and it was cereal.  Additionally, I felt immediately better after serving notice on this money pit and then selling it to the porcelain gods.  In the morning I was able to eat without a single lean.    The sad thing is that I initially enjoyed my experience here.  I had excellent service which I tipped very well for and was ready to write a favorable review that was until the sheriff knocked and served notice on my meal.",

Martini seemed to lack alcohol & it's $10. Had to wait fairly long for food. When it arrived it was hot and very tasty. Kudos for flavor except for sauteed spinach; garlic overload. My burger while very good was overdone. Our server who was very pleasant comped the burger when he discovered it was not as I ordered. He did so without me requesting it.

    "text": "hello heaven...who knew you were here on earth in the form of fabulous food & perfect corner booth ambiance?   i ventured to bricktops on thursday for a lunch meeting and while the company was good, my main takeaway (as it has been in the past) was feeling impressed with my overall dining experience.  greeted upon arrival by hostess, ushered immediately to our booth, greeted shortly thereof by a server who shared the daily features, drinks delivered & refilled in a timely fashion and finally the food.  i went with the grilled steak salad fresh vine ripe tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles with a vinaigrette dressing - others went with the flatbread,  french fries and even blackened fish tacos - we left feeling comfortably full and satisfied with our meals.  while the variety is good, i still feel like the prices are just a tad too high - but maybe the covers the rest of the experience? this remains on my list of definite go to spots in southpark.",

    "text": "Went the other night with a friend that raved about how good this place was.  The import beer selection was very small.  The beef Carpaccio was just average.  (if you want the best go to Collectors Cafe in Myrtle Beach, you'll be licking the plate). Then I got the Ahi Tuna which was missing something.  I\"m not sure if it was the sauce that was throwing it off or what.  The scoop of white rice didnt even look appetizing",

    "text": "My fish tacos were pretty good but overpriced for the two small tacos and spoonful of rice. My friend got the crab salad - it was tiny. Our waitress was not the best. She forgot the silverware - even after we got our salads. Had to ask twice for salad dressing. The girl that was filling up water glasses was trying to be cute but was just unbelievably rude. Next time I will go to Firebirds. On the plus side - the place is nicely decorated.",

    "text": "One of my favorites in town for consistently good quality food. Went there Friday for restaurant week with my wife and another couple and we all love it.  The seared scallop on the country ham grits were fantastic. I have gotten the parmesan chicken on several occasions and it's wonderful as well. The deviled eggs are as good as advertised.  Plus the location is cool and comfortable.  A winner.",

    "text": "The food is always amazing. The Palm Beach Salad is a longtime favorite because it's fresh and consistent. Crab, avocado, red onion, tomato, lettuce. The French dip is the most delicious steak sandwich. This time we had the Margherita Pizza which is thin, crunchy and tasty and the bread pudding is DELICIOUS.",
