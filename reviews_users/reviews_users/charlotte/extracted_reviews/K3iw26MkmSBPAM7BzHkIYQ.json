    "text": "I came with my boyfriend and his family for dinner and all six of us were sorely, sorely disappointed. Not only was the food overpriced and gross, but the manager was all kinds of shady.  What we ordered: Tempura appetizer ($8.95) Morrison Roll ($13.95) Sunrise Roll ($9.95) Honeymoon Roll ($5.95) Hibachi Chicken entree ($13.95) Hibachi Steak & Scallop entree [+ upgrade to filet mignon] ($22.95)  The rolls were DINKY and mediocre at best. My boyfriend says he can find better rolls at Harris Teeter. The chicken in the hibachi chicken entree was overcooked, dry, and salty. The steak in the hibachi steak entree was super dry and supposed to be medium rare, which it wasn't.  Honestly, tacking on \"Asian Fusion\" to your restaurant name does not give you an excuse to serve poorly-made, half-assed, inauthentic \"Japanese\" food.  The fun doesn't stop there. When I got the check, I was surprised to see \"19.67% Gratuity\" added on to the subtotal. I knew from what was printed in the menu that an 18% gratuity is automatically added for parties of six or more. I called our waiter over to give us an explanation; his response was shady and unclear. I obviously wasn't satisfied so he had the manager come over to explain it, which he did in an even more shady manner. He said something to the effect of \"Just subtract the tax from the subtotal and the gratuity comes out correctly.\" When I didn't buy that explanation either, he said \"The computer says 19.67% but if you add it up it's 18%.\"  Anyone with a pea-sized brain would see through the manager's pathetic and feeble attempt to justify the arbitrary 19.67% gratuity. I literally had to punch out the numbers on a calculator in front of him just to show him what 18% really amounted to. He took the check back to \"check it out.\" When he returned, he said he took out gratuity so that we could give however much we saw fit. He didn't even give a simple apology; a \"sorry about that\" would have sufficed. Needless to say, I left muuuch less than 18%.   If you end up siding with the majority opinion here (which I find shocking), at the very least do a double-take when you get your check. I didn't think there could be such shady behavior at a somewhat upscale restaurant, especially in the South Park area, but I was clearly proven wrong.  P.S. Fun fact: \"yama\" in Thai means \"don't come.\" Take that as a warning :P",

Someone else reviewed that the food was bland, and I couldn't agree more. The rolls were slathered in loads of avocado that covered up all flavor. They were also drowning in aioli sauces.  I love sushi, eat it at almost any city I'm in, like Charlotte, and I've certainly has much much better. Don't waste the time, money or taste buds.",

    "text": "This is a quiet little sushi place in the Morrison shopping center. I decided to go there for lunch today for a trial run before deciding if it would be good for a dinner sometime and was really disappointed.  I really like the atmosphere here, it makes for a nice quiet lunch and I got seated and my order taken pretty fast when coming in. I opted for the lunchtime sushi bento box since it had most of the basics which is always a good measure to judge a restaurant by. I really liked the miso soup with a nice amount of tofu, seaweed and not too salty to start with. The bento came out shortly afterwards and the gyoza was perfect! warm and yummy with a slight char on the outside. Usual salad with a slightly peanut based dressing I think. The nigiri however was not up to par at all. The fish was fresh and cut nicely but I think they forgot to show some love to the rice somewhere along the way! The rice was cold and hard and after the meal was over did not work very well with my tummy. I thought it was a fluke so I tried them all, sadly they were all hard, cold, and tasteless with not even a hint of vinegar blended in properly.  I don't know if I'll come back, and if I do I think I'll just stick to the sashimi. I really wanted to like this place but I don't think it's worth it when there are plenty of options around like Upstream, and The cow fish just minutes away.",

I have a few favorites (Morrison, HM, New Yorker) and have never been completely dissatisfied when trying new ones. The staff is friendly and willing to offer recommendations. We typically go with friends before a movie at Phillips Place and have been in and out within an hour - fast service if you know what you want, are sharing with others and are ready to order.   The bar is just OK and close to the seated area so on busy nights it feels tight but it's also great to see their business thriving. The ginger-tinis are delicious. They also used to run a great deal with Winestore (next door) but it's rumored that they have stopped the promo. You used to be able to bring a bottle from WS and they would uncork the first bottle for free. It was a great deal for my husband and I who love wine. Unfortunately, a bottle off of Yama's list will run you at least $25-$30. I'll stick with the sake from now on - lots to choose from!   It's not going to turn into a techno club like Nikko or Enso. Much more down to earth, basic decor and a great place for groups/conversation and families.",

You get what you pay for and Yama has the freshest and best tasting fish (sushi or sashimi) I have ever had and I've been eating sushi for 40 years, including in Tokyo.  The nigiri sushi and the sashimi are made with larger pieces of fish than most places so factor that into the cost as well.  My wife is Asian and we've tried sushi all over Charlotte and we both agree that Yama definitely has the freshest and best tasting fish.  If you want rolls, which are more rice and other ingredients than fish then go to a cheaper place but if you are a True sushi or sashimi fan you will not find fresher better tasting fish anywhere other than Yama.",

It made my boyfriend angry that there was a lot of tables empty in a nicer area of yama. So we sat down and started to look at the menu and ordered two special rolls and habachi chicken. The salad was okay and the miso soup was clearly tasted and almost looked like water. The habachi was very salty and the two rolls we order looked the exact same thing. chopped tuna on top and crunchy bits scattered on top. very disappointing since they both had almost every ingredient  inside.

As we were taking our seats, I asked the bartender if he had a cocktail menu and here's where things went bad.  He acted annoyed and said \"of course we do!\" It was a tone that made me respond with \"you acted like I asked a stupid question.\"  Then, as I often do when I'm new to a place, I ask the bartender \"do you have a specialty?\" since many restaurants have a signature drink.  Again, the bartender was rude. \"Of course. I can make anything you want.\" Not in a friendly way.  Then, he left the bar area and went to the kitchen without saying he'd be back or asking for our order.  As I sat there with my friend, I said, \"I don't want to spend my money here given the way we've been treated.\"  So we left. After giving it some thought, it dawned on me that the bartender was being purposefully rude because one of us, at least, was dressed more masculine. So, it was a bit of anti-LGBT bias in my estimation.  There was no other reason for his rudeness, because all we did was sit down at the bar and try to make conversation.  Rest assured that I will never visit this establishment again and will let others know what we experienced.  I tried to reach the manager via the website to report this, and did, but have not received a response. Therefore, I offer this Yelp review.  THIS WAS NO SIMPLE MISCOMMUNICATION. DO NOT INSULT ME BY SAYING SO.",

    "text": "All this time I always thought my metric for judging how good a sushi restaurant was the quality of the fish, or the taste of the rolls. I apparently was wrong. I first heard about Yama when it opened and was told I needed to try it out.   I was surprised that the rave reviews were gushing because the environment was very clinical and cold. What's worse is that it had an overwhelming smell of bleach. Unfortunately, no matter how good a piece of sashimi is, if my nostrils are being filled with chemicals, I'm not going to be able to enjoy it. Don't get me wrong- I appreciate that they take sanitation seriously! But ever since then, I have enjoyed my rolls and sashimi consistently, but the smell kills it for me and just doesn't put it at the top of my regular rotation. I need to remember to go in summer months and eat outside and my problem would be cured!   Their edamame is often over boiled and not seasoned enough and I had a friend who got an entree they thought was fine but not amazing.    Bottom line: If you're in the Southpark area and have a hankering for sushi, it's a good place if you don't have a sensitive nose or can sit outside.",

The service is almost always good, and it's nice to have a place where I'm recognized by some of the staff members.  Sushi is always fresh and tasty.  Dishes I order often: Avocado roll Salmon roll Magic Roll (off-menu) Rainbow roll Surf clam nigiri Seaweed salad Gyoza Edamame Hot house sake Salad with ginger dressing  I knock off a star for atmosphere. The lighting in the restaurant is hideous. I feel like I'm in a gymnasium. The decor was done very nicely, but they ruined it with the lighting. The result is a cold feeling environment not conducive to lingering, romantic, relaxing dinners. Also, the bathroom door to the ladies' room is out of whack and slams very loudly. If you're unlucky enough to sit directly across from the restrooms (which is quite unlucky to start), you'll be serenaded by the constant, startling BAM every few minutes. My recommendation is to sit outside when the weather is nice. It's much better out there.",

That, of course, doesn't mean that the food is good, but it's always nice to see.  When I first looked at the menu, I was a little worried: it was on the expensive side. Soon, however, I realized that I was reading the dinner section. The lunch specials are much more reasonably priced. I ordered a sushi bento box, which was tasty, almost too big to finish, and only about $10. The other components of the box were quite tasty as well.  Yama--give it a try!",

    "text": "Mmmhhmm just like Dan K. says, order enough sushi and you are served via boat. Who doesn't want to eat off of a mini yacht?   Yama has some solid sushi - some of my favorite in Charlotte. For some time hubs and I would only hit up Nikko, but I'm not keen on the bumping beats after 7:30 pm, so we sought sushi elsewhere. Yama is situated in the super sweet Morrison shopping center with a plenty of parking. Inside, it looks like a pretty standard, upscale sushi bar - a smattering of tables in the back and front and an actual seated sushi bar. It's pleasant inside, but it's not \"tricked out\" like some other sushi locales.   The food is delicious. Hubs and I have tried a variety of their rolls and I haven't had anything less than super as of yet. Their fish is very, very fresh and they do have a bunch of creative rolls. Some of my personal favorites are: Snow roll - a rice paper wrapped fish fiesta, the Charlotte roll and the Firecracker roll. It's also nice to see that there are only very few rolls that are super fried or stuffed with cream cheese. That's just not my bag.  The edamame was tasty, steamed just enough and salted to our liking. Their hot food, from what I've tasted, was quite good as well. Standard dumplings and Hibachi.   The staff at Yama are attentive and helpful, yet wisely let us hammer down our sushi in peace. The owners are there quite often and they are always very kind and grateful that we came in, whether it's for takeout or for dinner.   Yay for Yama, a traditional sushi experience!",

It was a first-time experience for my entire family, including myself.  Now I wish we would have known about this gem sooner!    The Saturday wait for a party of four was only about 15 minutes.  The food selection is great, which includes Asian-inspired appetizers, sushi, entrees, and desserts.  They also have an impressive Sake offering.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  Our meal included miso soup, ginger salad, fried oysters, short ribs, firecracker roll, volcano roll, steak hibachi, chicken katsu, and unagi don.  (My mouth is watering just thinking about our meal!) We also enjoyed a bottle of reisling and a bottle of their hana akana (sp?) sake -- both were phenomenal!!    Ask for Melissa if you can -- she was our server and she was awesome!  Very attentive and nice.  The food comes out quickly, as well.  You must try this place -- you won't be disappointed!  It is now one of our favorite restaurants, for sure!",

As we were leaving, the restaurant was starting to get busier for dinner service.  The waiter we had was enthusiastic and friendly. I ordered the chicken and shrimp hibachi and my date ordered sushi. We were going to get the Tempura Roll & H&M Roll, but the waiter suggested the Magic Roll (not listed on the menu) instead of the Tempura Roll. It was a great suggestion and had a good taste to it! For dessert, we had the tempura ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate. The dessert tasted like a funnel cake with ice cream - it was perfect!  The restaurant is dim and in a tucked away area of SouthPark. For a date night, this restaurant was great and not overly expensive. Great service, food, and ambience - overall great experience!",

We skipped the appetizer and went right for entrees - he got the Snow Roll, and I got hibachi chicken (boring, I know).  The chicken tasted very fresh, and the fried rice had more flavor than most.  Fella said the sushi was good but on par with the place he normally goes.  He was impressed that there were 10 rolls instead of the standard 8, which also made the price ($14.95) a little more reasonable.  I thought the price for the hibachi chicken ($14.95) seemed lower than most places.  All in all, a solid experience.",

Edamame--It was okay but it was stuffed in a bowl that was too small so the salt was only on the top two or three pieces.  When we asked for more salt we were offered a salt shaker that had large crystalized salt in it, so..... the salt wouldn't come out.  There were several pieces that did not have the beans in them at all.    The house salad with ginger dressing was very good.    The sushi combinations were just okay.  Anything we ordered with spicy tuna was pretty good and seemed fresh.  The salmon was just so-so and the yellowtail was very fishy.  I was told by one of my dining partners that the lobster roll was very good.  I think I was a little disappointed because even the rolls that offered \"crunch\" had no crunch at all.  So, the consistency was a bit bothersome.  I also didn't think the pieces were very big for the price.    The atmosphere was okay, nothing special.  The service was decent but we had to wait quite awhile and there was no one in the restaurant.   Bottom line..I was expecting MUCH more from this place due to all the fabulous reviews.

Our waitress was well informed and listened intently when taking the order.  We sat at the sushi bar and overheard her instructing the chef preparing our order.  The special (forgot the name) was recommended and was fabulous, as was the Boston Roll (spicy salmon topped with seared tuna, scallion and masago). We didn't have too much of an appetite so this hit the spot.  Of course, since we were so tired, we went for a slice of the chocolate cake (see photo) to boost our energy levels.  It was served on the cool side, but was rich and yummy for sharing.  It's a good thing because I assure you I would have eaten the entire slice!  The wine I selected for the evening was an even bigger surprise.  McManus Petite Syrah - it did not dissappoint!",

My family is definitely coming again and I'm definitely bringing my friends here. The owner is very friendly and the servers are amazing as well. My family ordered a lot of the specialty sashimi and wow it just melts in your mouth. If you want to have really good sushi come here. It may be pricy but it's pricy because the quality. I still can't get over how delicious it was. This restaurants quality went way over the quality I got at Ru Sans, and Ru Sans was pretty good quality. I'm most definitely coming here again! **Update Let me restate just a little bit, don't get me wrong this place is amazing but it's amazing for the sashimi. If you're looking for rolls don't come here looking for something and disappointed this place is for people that have experience eating sushi and want something exotic because Yama's has selections other place do not have. I come here for sashimi and Ru San's for rolls.",

If you're a cooked sushi fan try \"Big Mike's\" a delicious take on surf n' turf (off-menu), if sashimi tuna is your thing try \"HM roll\", and for eel \"Uptown\".  Not only is Yama the best sushi in town, it is the best sushi I have ever had anywhere.  You can get fresher sashimi in Sydney, Tokyo, LA, Honolulu but the rolls at Yama and the caliber of fresh ingredients used makes this my favorite sushi restaurant.",

My husband and one of our daughters went here this past Saturday evening.  Wait time was 20 minutes- much better than other restaurants we called.  As promised we were seated within that time frame.  Only problem was that we waited 1.5 hours for our food! And parts of it were missing.  The waitress was sweet and apologized several times. However, she then started avoiding us b/c I suppose she knew there was nothing she could do.  When we finally ate and received our check, she and the hostess apologized and said they took a couple things off the bill (the two cheapest items- edamame and one of our salads).  That would have been a nice gesture if we had received those items to begin with!  Done with this place until I consistently hear things have improved.",

It's a little on the pricey side, but the portions are huge. If you with a friend or significant other and usually order 4 rolls, you'll probably only need 3, and since the price is a little higher, probably best anyway...ha!   Service is spot on and the recommendations are very good. My favorite rolls are the snow roll w/soy paper and the crazy tuna roll. Sushi is so fresh and the place is larger than Cyros. So if you're in the South Park area make sure to check it out as it's located across from Earth Fare.",

Cowfish (which serves burgers too - yes, I ) was #1. Yama...sushi was good...not great...not bad. The prices rival a high-end sushi restaurant and it's anything but. The service was poor and I was in on a Sunday night and they were not busy at all. Example: Ordered the first time: Nigiri sampler, substitute a different roll for the California Roll (the fact that they pair it with a California roll should tell you who they cater to) per the server's suggestion.....server comes back....we can't do that; my manager won't let us do that anymore. It was your suggestion...know your business. I go a la carte on the nigiri....order...server comes back and tells me they are out of the snapper. Ok..just double up my yellowtail then. Server comes back (third time)...we are out of the tuna you wanted. I look at server and say..\"man, you guys are on a roll (no pun intended) tonight.\" Salad comes....$4.50...wasn't very good..half fresh lettuce. Sushi..again, not bad but for $58 total (and I had a water), it should be great with great service. This place has neither. I'm amazed that in a metro of 2.5M people, this is a 4-star sushi place.

Sashimi was about a $1 more than other places, but well worth it because the pieces were huge.  The Rainbow Roll was delicious. (This is a great roll to judge a place by)    Only thing I didn't like, is all their rolls that list crab as an ingredient, don't have ANY crab in them!  They put Pollock fish in there instead.  Apparently places in this town are doing this ...I don't know how they're getting away with it... how can you say something has crab when it doesn't?  I guess people around here either don't know the difference, or they do and put up with being lied to.  The end result is the sushi places keep getting away with it.  You couldn't get away with that scam in California.  Crab is crab, fish is fish, there is a BIG BIG difference in taste and texture.  If you order crab and they give you fish, don't let them get away with it, SAY SOMETHING!  They can only do what we allow them to get away with.  The other thing, is the Ikura (Salmon roe) was wrinkled and mushy, not crisp and refreshing like it's supposed to be.  It also had a funky not-so-fresh taste that made it unpleasing.  This was disappointing because it's usually my favorite item to eat alongside my rolls.  I also think they have too much spice in the ginger's marinade, it totally overpowered it's natural complex flavor.  The Hibachi chicken dish was average, so I would stick to just the sushi here.  So for lying about the ingredients and for bad Ikura, I need to take off at least one star.  Yama is still one of the better places I've found so far in this town.  If they got those two issues fixed, they'd be a solid 5 stars for sushi!",

    "text": "First time here. Surprised at how nice it was given the typical strip mall exterior. In keeping this one short.we got the Tuna wrapped in Cucumber, the \"Paul's Roll\" (NO not named after me - I wish) and the Crispy Bagel Roll. The Paul's roll was very creamy with fresh tuna, cream cheese and avocado. There was NO crunch at all in it, which is OK. But the Bagel Roll was unusual in that there was NO bread or \"bagel\" component to it at all. I believe the roll was oh so lightly breaded then flash fried to give it the TEXTURE of a crispy bagel. Well it worked! Loved this roll!  Our service was fantastic and overall this was an excellent experience. However, as you've all heard me say, NOTHING beats Sushi Guru for Sushi ROLLS!",

You can tell a lot about a sushi restaurant by how it is decorated. The staff was friendly and the chefs were having a good time, which I also believe to be a good sign.  I ordered the yellowtail sushi, a spicy tuna handroll and a seared tuna-type roll. Oh my. Everything was incredibly fresh and on point. I had been craving sushi for literally weeks and Yama hit the spot. I am so happy that I found a great sushi place in my new city.",

But GADAAAAAAAM that bill was screaming (gottta work overtime, gotta work overtime) we ordered some edamame and seaweed salad for appetizer couple of beer and hot sake it was all pretty good, then got a specialty sushi roll and a sushi boat worth of sashimi everything we had was really good! All high quality and fresh! I loved the food here but it is definitely a place for da rich people! I can maybe afford to eat here 1 time a year. Anyways my good friend Lylie picked up the bill for me so I was off the hook on that one lololol.",

    "text": "I've been told by a few people that this is the best sushi in Charlotte.  After eating there, I have to say, Best Sushi in Charlotte is a pretty hard argument to make.   I ordered a miso soup, house salad, Firecracker Roll, and a Volcano Roll.  Below are my thoughts on each.  Miso Soup:  Watery.  Very little flavor with mini tofu pieces.  House salad:  Dressing was good, but the lettuce was brown and tomatoes were not yet ripe.  Volcano Roll:  Menu said it had lava sauce on top.  i guess my image of lava sauce is a deep red chili paste sauce.  Their version was some type of congealed slop with a sweet (rather than spicy) taste with waaaayyyy to much tossed on top of the roll.  Gross.  Firecracker Roll:  The best of the night.  The sauce was redder and thinner than what was on the volcano roll and was more in line with what I would think of as lava sauce.  Still, the tempura breading was pretty thick and was too overpowering for the tuna.   Finally, service was friendly, but I sat at the sushi bar.  There were no chairs at the center of the bar with a wooden panel that could easily hold the sushi going out.  However, this held the stand to put the tickets on when servers picked them up.  The sushi was placed directly in front of the patrons sitting at the bar, so I spent most of the night with servers hanging over me either waiting for the orders, or picking up the orders...directly in front of me.",

We decided to give this place a try, they had sushi and hibachi. We decided we were going to have hibachi, but the hibachi was actually off the menu. We think of hibachi is where they cook in front of you. That's not what this place is.  The service was terrible, slow. We were the only ones in the restaurant dining side, and then there were probably four more tables sat after us and most got their orders, drinks and food before us (by a different server).  We ordered the steak and scallops, and the steak and chicken in addition with Calamari as an appetizer. When we received the Calamari it was very oily in a different way. When we received the main course it was very oily too, everything was saturated in oil.  We did not even like the rice.  Oh and the menus smell. It was really nasty. It smelled like vomit.   We end up getting sick on the food when we returned to the hotel, good thing we didn't go out afterwards. We do not recommend this place, we will not come back.",

It used to be the same old places, but now with the competition moving in people will have to up their games to compete.  Know your roll.... I only tried 2 rolls during my first visit here last night, but they were delicious and very filling.  The menu had a lot of other rolls to try that sounded super yummy so I have a feeling this place will not get old fast with the variety of rolls offered.  The menu also had a lot of sake - which I could totally go for on a weekend.. not when I have a deadline to beat on a Friday (the following day).  Our server was very nice and was patient with us since we were a large group and did not all arrive at the same time.  Making reservations for the group, and it was just a quick, painless (less than a minute) phone call.  I did feel a little funny since the phone is quickly answered with a quick \"yama\" and I found myself stumbling over my words, but I managed to get my gears turning and the words finally came out coherently.     Overall... this is my \"sushi-go-to\" place for the time being.",

Overall the sushi here is fresh and delicious.  The Morrison roll, and the crazy tuna roll are two of my favs!! The gyoza, clear soup, miso soup, and salad are all extremely good as well :-)  I have tried their hibachi dishes and I've had better. I generally stick with sushi here though and the sushi never disappoints.   I've read some other reviews and I have on occasion experienced some of the haughtiness of the staff/owners.  I'm going to be honest I have some friends who know and are friends with the owners, so for me to admit that is telling. However I think it may mostly just be the result of someone having a stressful/bad day.  I'm not saying it's an excuse especially considering the prices here, but everyone has a bad day!    The wine selection here is good, but the Saki selection is bar none the most fabulous thing here.  Don't get me wrong the sushi is to die for and probably some of the freshest I've had in Charlotte, but the Saki mmmhmmm the Saki!! They are well stocked with amazing hand picked selections. The staff is knowledgeable and always ready to lend a helping hand in your choices as well.    Overall I suggest trying this place it puts cowfish to shame and I kind of like cowfish on occasion haha.  It really is my favorite sushi place in town, and I'd truly give it 4 1/2 Stars, high prices and all.",

We decided as a family agreement, even if the food wasn't good, Sara R. would have made it better. Do you know service affects the taste of food? I have to say it does. Make sure you request her if you get the chance!   My family was be craving for sushi, and well since it was Christmas Eve and I was in town... The decision was made. Plus, sushi in Knoxville didn't really stir well with me. So Yama it was, I did salivate over some pictures my parents sent me the week before.   Walking inside, the decor was modern. It definitely represented the type of food that they served. I mean, not going to brag about the bathroom, but they had a plant in there! What Japanese restaurant would have that?   Anyways, to the food! We ordered 2 orders of Uni, 2 Sashimi boats which comes with an assortment of 14 pieces (we're on that low carb diet) and an order of fatty tuna. Oh and a large and house sake.   All that... For about 125. That filled all four of us up and it was quite delicious added with the amazing service. So will I ever be back? As long as Sara is our waiter, I'm sure this will probably be my default place for sushi whenever I'm back in town.  Edit: I forgot to add that their sushi is fresh, flown in from NY. This dwarfs any other sushi restaurant around town, however there are several other I believe that flies their sushi in. But, come here so you can taste the deliciousness!",

Also, when you pull up the place on yelp it says you get 25% off on a bottle of sake, but once you actually check in, that is only valid on Valentines day, kind of a bait and switch.  I was quickly sat down, but right next to a group of extremely loud guys in an otherwise pretty much empty room.  Our waiter was nice enough to recommend a $95 bottle of sake, lol.  After ordering a few rolls and some sashimi I did get a small $30 bottle of sake that was recommended as well.  Our server was pretty good at keeping our sake glasses filled, but not so much on my water.  He just kept forgetting, which was kind of a problem when one of the rolls I ordered was especially spicy.  I know, it sounds like nothing but complaints, but there was nothing really compelling about this place to me.  If you live in the area, maybe $7 rolls is the norm, but I don't seem to ever have to pay that much in the Charlotte area.  And with that extra money I would hope for extra special service, but not the case.  I only tipped 15% on pre-tax, not my style at all, but I'm sure he did well on all the other people he paid more attention to.",

Very nice, with dim lighting, a bar, sushi bar and multiple rooms for dining.  The service was spot on and our waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Note: I would recommend reservations on Friday or Saturday as every table was full and most people had reservations. We started with miso soup, which was a larger portion than normal spots.  As for the sushi we ordered some nigiri, some of the best, freshest sushi I have ever had. The tuna was amazing! We also ordered some rolls, and the one that stood out was the Morrison Roll, filet with shrimp tempura, so good. I definitely will make this my go to sushi spot!",

It took almost 30 minutes to get our food and when we got home - less than five minutes away - the calamari was cold, greasy, and rubbery. The hibachi was so-so, and the sushi was okay - nothing to write home about. For the stiff price tag (almost $60), and the good reviews on yelp, I expected much better.",

We had calamari and shrimp shumai for appetizers, and they were both really good. I had a ginger salad and the snow roll. It was a great sushi roll but I wish I had gotten something else as well. I didn't leave hungry by any means, but I should've ordered some veggies or something on the side. A couple people in our party had hibachi shrimp, steak, and chicken. It all looked delicious. I wouldn't mind checking it out again next time I'm in Charlotte.",

With any roll I recommend asking for Eel Sauce and Spicy Mayo on the side, it totally changes the flavor of the meal and makes it so much more exciting. Price is not bad, $11 per roll, $3 for the soup. 5 Stars!!",

In addition to the standard miso soup Yama serves an outstanding clear soup that is addictive!  Want to try sake but don't know what to order?

Starting with a seaweed salad, it was nice to see the portion placed on top of a small pile of iceberg lettuce. I thought that this was pleasing and certainly added to the salad.  For mains, we chose the Snow Roll and a mix of other nigiri and sashimi. The snow roll was excellent. Really tasty, well stuffed, perfectly rolled mix of fish and rice and the pink paper. Nice to look at, great to eat. The tuna sashimi was sliced thick and extremely delish. Very meaty, very good tuna flavor.  Serious points for Yama. Very good stuff! Will return for sure.",

I was impressed by this establishment, mostly because there is no reason I should not have been. Located in the SouthPark area of Charlotte, it is near both shopping and nightlife. The atmosphere is cool, very LA in that it has all the trendy benchmarks of what you would expect from a modern sushi bar. The service was very good for dinner and the Hibachi lunch menu is pretty straightforward, but as we say at Soundboy America, it's always about the Maki, baby.  If you want to avoid the after work drink-pounding office crowd, check them out for lunch - the crowd is a bit more diverse: from corporate types, shoppers, hipsters to merchants with the day off. The dinner crowd by comparison is vibrant and up-tempo, but keep in mind that you run the risk of being next to a co-worker birthday celebration.  Both the import and domestic beer selection is above average, just like the sushi prices. They did a pretty good job on the \"Soundboy\" roll (salmon Philly tempura) but overall I would definitely take a date there that I was trying to impress. Just know what you are doing in advance and be ready to drop a hundred bones including wine and tip. But that is all about location which is reflective in the bill. Overall I would recommend it.",

Lots of original sushi with some fake ones as well (I call all fried/Philly cheese/american type sushis fake). It's a little pricy, but the quality compensates. Very polite and friendly waiter.",

I have been here 4 times and every time it has been great quality for a good price.  I have also brought 3 other people, who all said I made the right choice for sushi, so I think that this will please most people.  I like this better than Nikko's because it's cheaper and in my opinion has a better variety.  As far as their staff goes, every time I have been there the staff has been very attentive and friendly, without being overbearing.  Overall I would highly recommend giving this place a try if you're looking for sushi in Charlotte.",

I have eaten at Yama dozens of times and they have been consistantly excellent. From the taste and quality of the food to the great service and atmosphere. If you're a sake fan they have quite a good selection. For my money, the best sushi in town.",

    "text": "We are regulars at Yama now. Been there at least a dozen times. We love sushi and like that it's consistently fresh and expertly prepared, something I find hard to say about other Charlotte sushi spots.   Our favorites are the Big Mike roll (not on the menu but a special almost al the time, its basically a Morrison roll with added crab), the Morrison, the Boston Roll, Sweet Potato roll (tried on the recommendation of another Yelp review and liked it!), Crazy Tuna roll and if you prefer cooked food, the Chicken Katsu is very crispy.  Service is mixed. It's usually fast and friendly, but not necessarily voluntarily helpful. However a few times we've had excellent service, it's just unpredictable.   Atmospherically, it can get loud and they keep the a/c jacked up, bring a sweater or drink green tea! Yama is pricey, my recommendation is to pick a big roll or two to share and supplement with some of the smaller more basic, but still excellent ones. The large rolls are quite filling.  If you like desert, let me recommend the chocolate cake. Yes, chocolate cake at a sushi restaurant, and it's some of the best in Charlotte! The only negative? No coffee to drink with it!! It's huge, bring a friend and get two forks.",

Most of the sushi places I've been to in Charlotte are fun and personable in their own ways - but they often have some kind of gimmick (music, scene, eclectic menu) and \"ok\" sushi.  Yama is nice, streamlined, professional - seeming to focus on good food.  At the recommendation of our waitress, I had the HM roll and loved it.  I sampled a few of my fellow diners' rolls too and all were good.  Most of the rolls on the menu were about $10-14.  Atmosphere is nice - quiet and modern, lots of wood, local art on the walls.  Service was great.  They were very responsive, subtle and perfect on timing.",

    "text": "My current sushi crush in town- love these guys and the quality sushi they are putting out.  Combine that with the fact there is no corkage fee when you bring in a bottle just bought 2 doors down at Winestore, and this is date night with the wife, asian-style.  Menu contains most of the staples you expect at a sushi house- a host of rolls, nagiri and all the standard appetizers.  I'm partial to the seaweed salad here- always fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Sadly, they put regular lettuce in the bottom of the bowl to make it look fuller, but I still think you get a nice portion size for an appetizer salad.  Steamed endamame is also good, if not just a bit pricey for the small-ish portion size you get.    Maki rolls are the mainstay here, and you can find all the usual suspects, along with a Southpark-themed list of specialty rolls.  One standout, though, is the sweet potato roll.  Simply tempura fried strips of sweet potato rolled up in nori and rice.  It is crazy good with a little wasabi and soy sauce- just a great balance of sweet with salty and then the heat of the wasabi.  I don't know who else in town is doing this roll, but they sure should.  They also have a number of other dishes on their menu for non-sushi eaters, but I can't say I've tried any.  I do see lots of folks order the tempura vegetables and the huge plate that comes along with it, but I pass because I know I'm going to stuff myself with the fresh goodness of their rolls.  Staff service here has been a little mixed and they do get spread thin when things get busy for dinner service on Fridays and Saturdays, but so long as I'm into my wine, I don't mind a little extra wait.  At least you do get warm hand towels when the server first comes to your table- always a nice touch.  There's also a small outdoor patio seating area which is nice when the weather permits.  For True sushi-love, I heart Yama.",

There are plenty of restaurants that will treat customers with respect don't waste your time at Yama Asian Fusion.  In response to Yama Asian Fusion's:  The only person who was rude was the manager. No one in our group raised there voice or said anything out of line.  The manager was rude from the moment he came to the table.  We never even requested to see him.  All we did was ask the server a simple question in regards to the corkage fee and what it was we had seen on the Web.  He immediately got belligerent refused us service and told us to leave.  He came to the table in attack mode never wanted to hear what we had to say.  He was rude and there was no excuse for that.",

They also have a bar area.   I think the fusion comes from the ingredients that they use in their specialty rolls.  They even have soy paper wrapped rolls for those who do not indulge in seaweed.  They were not bad.  Also, another thing is they have a decent amount of non fried rolls.  Many places go overboard on the fried rolls which is a bit much at times.

Good thing my friends are also sushi lovers (except for one, who tolerates our love as long as hibachi or other cooked meat is available).  We had a spur of the moment post work sushi dinner last week and found ourselves at Yama. There were a steady stream of customers for a Wednesday (we were happy there was no wait, because cowfish down the street had an hour and a half wait on a Wednesday, see below). However, it took the hostess about 15 minutes to put a table together for a party of 5, which should not have been such a difficult task.  Once seated, our waiter was prompt and took our drink orders (I decided to skip the $10 cocktails and go for a glass of wine). The drinks are on the pricey side. For dinner, I had miso soup and the crazy tuna roll. The miso soup was solid, tons of tofu and scallions, which I love. However, my roll was just ok. I think it's because the inside of the roll was seared tuna, then topped with raw. I thought the seared tuna inside was weird. I tried my friend's h&m roll and an eel roll, and both of those were good.  Overall, the outing was fun (as dinners with friends are) but Yama was ok. The rolls are a bit overpriced, our server was not at the top of his game and it was not the best sushi ever. Next time Ill probably stick to my old faithful (spicy tuna roll) rather than a specialty roll, but you don't learn until you try!",

We were considering getting something to eat or a bottle if sake, especially because we live across the street, our address is one off from the restaurant. I work at a restaurant and my guests are important to me, on or off work, my wife used to work at a sushi restaurant down the street. We are most forgiving when it comes to servers, having been servers before. The worst thing was that I asked to speak to a manager when we didn't see our server for 20 minutes and we told him that we felt discriminated against and he said I will be right back and he never came back.

I'm definitely a fan but would request brown sauce as the white sauce tasted more like yogurt than the traditional white sauce...little pricey -$38 for 5 shrimp & 6 pieces of filet....",

    "text": "Yama is not as trendy (like Nicole W. mentioned) as some sushi joints (like Cowfish or cream-cheese-laden as Ru San's) but not as traditional as others (Musashi or even Simplee).  But if you want something in-between-- a mix of the usual seaweed salads, gyoza and some creative rolls, Yama is a solid bet.   It's been awhile since I've been to Yama (about a year and a half) and everything seems to have changed for the better.   The interior has been through some light renovations, and the space looks a bit more modern than before.  The only issue I noticed were some tables were dangerously close to other tables, separated only by bamboo poles, so you could see/hear a lot of what the table next to you is saying.  Don't let this deter you from enjoying some Yama goodness. Our server told us they added on to the menu too.   Overall, everything was executed very nicely.  The house salad is a good size, all the rolls are super fresh tasting and I thought very reasonable for the money. The dessert of fried bananas, sounds pretty ordinate...but it's paired with red bean ice cream, which I love. The service was very good-- but it can get really busy, even for a Thursday evening.  I'd suggest making reservations for popular times.   PS:  Since I'm not big of sushi with crazy amounts of rice, I would ask my rolls to be light on the rice.  Yama seems to use more rice in some special rolls than other places I've been-- which is fine, but to me, I like a good balance of insides to rice!",

We watched the chefs prepare the Morrison Roll (w/ Filet), and will get that next time.   Interior looks very Asian, and you forget you are in South Park as soon as you step in. Will come here more often, especially if CowFish continues to inflate their \"wait times\".",

Because... it is the most consistent when it comes to quality of food and service and the prices are typical sushi prices...kind of expensive, but I would say better than other places that don't give as good of a product.   The staff is always nice, welcoming and very attentive. The only thing I wish that this place had was better music and lighting.  It's kind of boring in there.  Don't get me wrong the place has a nice atmosphere just want a little more going on.  Basically, I would stay longer and drink more sake if they did. Check it out though, you won't be disappointed.",

However, I ordered the \"crazy tuna\" roll and it was so bland and tasteless. I am an avid sushi consumer and there are far, far better places to get sushi in south Charlotte in the same price range. Also, my side salad had unripe tomatoes, not appetizing. Our server wasn't very friendly either. Maybe I just came on an off day but our experience wasn't good.",

The food here is pricey, and it seems to draw a nice Charlotte crowd -- the type that thinks anything beyond Chili's, Red Robin, etc. is a cultural experience.    So if you like Harris Teeter sushi (cold rice, dry fish), but don't mind paying top dollar for it, you should come here.  It seems to attract a lot of white folks.  I think the owners aren't even Japanese.  I think they're Chinese.    Next.",

Some of the best sushi places are in CA and NYC. As for Charlotte, Yama is eh, not the best (still searching....hahaha). Atmosphere is what draws patrons to restaurants in Charlotte not food quality it seems, sorry. The drinks here are overpriced. I think $13 and up are too steep even for top shelf. The menu prices were high as well when taking into account the size of the sushi pieces and rolls. Otherwise, you feel like you only had appetizers when you paid for dinner! I gave them 1 star only because the waitress was very nice as in \"new at her job so she is being very cordial\" cause she didn't seem too confident. Very disappointed.",

After hearing that, I made it a priority to check it out after my next monthly visit to Earth fare. It took me forever to decide on a roll, even though I had studied the menu prior to going, but the server was so very helpful with her recommendations and they were eager to cater to whatever you asked for.......gotta love great service! I finally decided on the Southpark and Filet lover's roll and they both were out of this world good! As good as it was, I'm still hesitant to jump on that 'best sushi' in Charlotte train as Enso's sushi is equally as good as Yama in my opinion, but I will definitely be back........perhaps I'll need to save up before my next visit as the rolls are quite pricey at Yama, but worth every penny:-)",
