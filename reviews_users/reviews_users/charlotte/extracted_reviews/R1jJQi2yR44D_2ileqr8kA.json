The server seemed unconcerned. I asked her if they were short staffed today. She shrugged her shoulders and said they were \"just busy.\" The guy who sat down next to me walked out after 15 minutes of no service. The biggest issue is the indifference. They were slow, out off food, and didn't apologize once.  Not typical but hopefully not a trend. The mellow attitude ok for yoga class but epic fail for serving customers.",

I'd recommend the coconut's milk in this for a creamier experience.  While my meal and the service was above all expectations, all of the raw vegetables in the Living Burrito gave me a rough time later in the day.  Digestive science turned a mere 10 oz of food in to 4 gallons of VERY questionable BM.  The toilet at the Babies R Us that I ran into flushed on it's own due to the sheer volume/force.  There was definitely nothing charming about my Charmin that day.  I'd do it all over again, though.  One of the best restaurants in Charlotte!",

    "text": "On my usial business trip-induced quest for fiber before my flight back to The Big Crapple, my wife suggested I try Living Kitchen (she now insists she didn't, but that's a reflection on our marriage, not the restaurant).    The restaurant is in what looks like a recently Milenn-trified part of town, you know, where they renovate an old factory or warehouse into what is effectively a post-modern mall where the self-conscious bourgeois hyperenlightened masses can bask in luxury while evading micro-aggressions in a wholesome, nonjudgemental safe space.  I ordered the Fire and Brimstone burger and a beet salad.  Both were pretty good, although way short on the fire for a region so famous for its BBQ.  I am sure many other people have commented on the languid service.  I'm not in the free management consulting industry, but I'll offer my keen insight.  The main reason why the service is as laconic as it is, is because customer service is not part of the conception of the business.    The food, decor and even the customer demographic is finely honed, but as a workplace, the vibe is more a relaxed work environment geared to pleasant working conditions than a passionate dedication to excellence.    Surveying the staff, I could not identify anyone that ancient people used to call a manager.  In any case, if you like \"raw\", nutritious bohemian fare and your time is not that valuable to you, you could do somewhat worse than this ultra-contemporary. Yupstaurant.",

What's nice about Luna's is relative to other Raw Vegan restaurants, this is less grab-and-go, and more of sit down, enjoy a good meal, be seen, view the scene, etc.  They make an effort at artful presentation, the greens are all fresh, and the servers very polite and welcoming.    Luna's is located in an upscale shopping center adjacent to an Anthropologie, and their menu features a wide range of smoothies (from green to berry to cacao), to juices, salads, raw dishes (e.g., manicotti), breads, and desserts.    I tried the raw taco salad, which was excellent. The \"meat\" is made of walnuts, and the salsa is terrific.  Fresh avocado, black sesame seeds, crisp romaine lettuce, and gluten-free (I believe) taco shell round out the experience.  The salsa's raw onions are a little heavy if you're considering this and on a date night, however.  ;)  I loved the popeye smoothie, which is infused with hemp protein and spinach, so very good for your vegan muscles.  The apple juice and banana make it sweet and eminently palatable.  Finally, because how can I not go overboard, I had the falafel sampler.  Loved the pickled vegetables and hummus dip (crudite), although the baked falafels were a bit too far from regular falafel for my tastebuds.",

We were excited to see the menu on Yelp and we took an Uber there since we did not want to deal with parking. Each one of us tried a different dish and shared. I got the Mexican bowl, which was a big dish and was very flavorful. One of the other dishes was a manicotti which was a little different since it is a cold dish but still good. We also got the BLT as well as the pear pizza which were amazing. Their fresh juices were very refreshing and delicious. Their desserts were amazing. The cheesecake was a bit tangy but the turtle cake was amazingly delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that is vegan, vegetarian or just wants to eat something healthy.

Restaurant itself is great...it's so clean inside, the employees are really friendly, and they have indoor and outdoor seating. I would say the inside decor is somewhat hippish but it's not so overboard that you feel awkward if that's not your thing. It's very inviting inside and they have some near artwork up.   Secondly, the food!!!! Amazing! I got the a avocado and basil sandwich but instead of bread got it wrapped in collard greens. Omg I could not get enough. It had so many different tastes, the most prominent one being freshness! The hummus added a richness to it and even though it's now a lot of food, that definitely helps to feel more full after. Everything from the onions to the sprouts to the tomatoes made this sandwich. And how could you forget the a acacia, yum! I could eat them plain and be satisfied so this only made it that much better! You get a side with every sandwich so I got the kale salad, again deelicious, especially the dressing.   And then dessert...oh man. Got the berry lemon cheesecake, so good!!!! And again tasted so fresh! I really liked the pecan crust, completely different than \"normal\" cheesecake but it almost felt healthier....almost.   I cannot wait to go back and try pretty much everything but specifically the burgers!",

Not the case here.  Sure, the food isn't McDonald's inexpensive, but it's the right price for the quality of food and portion size.  And the food is delicious!  The fire and brimstone burger is one of the top 3 veggie burgers I've ever had.  My dining companion's enjoyed their mock tuna salad and living bagel as well.  The sides were also excellent.  I could have eaten at least 2 more portions of the beet salad and the broccoli waldorf salad was excellent as well.    I took off a star because I thought it took a little longer than usual for our food to arrive.  Our waitress, while efficient, wasn't especially friendly.  But next time I'm in Charlotte I'll definitely be back here for a bite!",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have to tell people what to order when they go because they are really good at what they do well, like no one can beat them but there are some things that they don't do well on the menu as well.",

This place offers all kinds of juices and food options. It's truly a fresh breath of air from all the processed and fried foods other eateries offer.   Now let's get started with the review... I had the Living Burrito and my family members had the Manicotti and Lunasagna. I did have more than one spoonful (or forkful I should say) of their plates as well so I feel qualified to review all the dishes. The Living burrito filling was delicious, from the refried beans to the cauliflower rice mixture. The collard leaf that wrapped together the ingredients was really hard to break through though. I also felt the dish went overboard with sprouts. I'm not a big fan of sprouts so it might just be me. The Manicotti was by far my favorite dish, excellent ricotta cashew cheese filling!! It made me never want regular ricotta cheese again, seriously where can I but cashew cheese?? The filling was wrapped by a thin slice of zucchini acting as the pasta. All served with a marinara sauce on top.  Lunasagna was my second favorite dish, more zucchini noodles and tomato sauce giving a spin on traditional lasagna. I did feel the portion was kinda tiny.  Side salads- I had the local green salad that came with more sprouts, cherry tomatoes and homemade hemp dressing on top of greens.  If I had to choose again I would get the Broccoli Waldorf- tiny broccoli bits, green apple, walnuts and raisins tossed with vegan mayo and lemon juice. I had a few bites from someone else's plate and it was tangy and sweet but oh so delicious!",

In my case, I would not recommend this place if you're picking up lunch for a team. The ordering process was sooo painful. So we placed our order, then 5 minutes later they called back telling us they're out of the Pad Thai (comm between hosts and the kitchen would be good here). Then we replace our order with wraps and go to pick it up.   First off, they almost forgot to give me my lemonade. Then we take it to the office only to find that FORGOT AN ENTREE. I felt so bad for my colleague that ended up with the side salad for her missing entree. Additionally, my entree was just not there, they just gave us an extra order of another entree. Le sigh.   I will say that the flavors were pretty good for vegan food. I usually don't go for vegan/vegetarian food because of a lack of flavor but this had some nice flavor profiles. I had the Living Burrito and the Kale Green Lemonade. The lemonade was very tasty but over-priced.  I would NEVER order lunch from this place again but I am willing to come in for a dine-in experience. This price rating for this place definitely needs to be upgraded to $$$.",

I went for dinner on a Saturday night & there was a good amount of diners but it wasn't overly busy & I was seated quickly. Surprisingly, this was my first experience with a vegan restaurant despite being vegetarian for 13 years. The menu options blew me away, I was not used to having an entire menu to choose my dinner from & it was difficult to choose because everything sounded so fresh & so good! Our server was very helpful with explaining the menu & injecting her own personal recommendations. We decided on the cheese platter which was good but not overwhelmingly so. The entrees, however were outstanding. My server recommended I try the macrobiotic bowl & it did not disappoint! It consisted of perfectly cooked quinoa, flavorful warm adzuki beans, pickled beet sauerkraut, sweet potatoes & kale. This dinner was one of the freshest & most flavorful meals I have ever had! I was never a fan of kale but I was scarfing it down in this bowl! The portion size was massive, I ate a significant amount & still hardly put a dent in the bowl, it could hardly fit in the Togo plate, so you get plenty of value for your money. Whoever makes the menu is clearly an expert on healthy, fresh vegan food. The ingredients just played & meshed so well together and I left with that content, vibrant feeling that you get when you're full & satiated with high quality, nutritious food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to meat eaters & vegetarians & vegans alike!",

Basically, what's not to love?  My all time favorite is the Lunasagna with its velvety texture and exquisite creaminess.  This time, I had the manicotti and found that pleasing as well.  Fresh tomato sauce and thin zucchini slices oozing with that lovely cashew cheese.  An arugula salad accompanied this dish, and it was fresh and crisp, delicately topped with a light, lemony dressing. I love that the expanded restaurant includes wine, and on this hot evening, I had a refreshing rose.  The carafes of water on the tables were also  a welcome touch. We had quite a large crowd seated on the patio, but this did not deter our excellent servers. So, Luna's remains one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  And, if I have to write ten more reviews of the place to prove it, I will.",

We were in a hurry and they were fast and efficient. For someone like me they had the mock-versions of mainstream food; I ended up getting a burrito in a leafy green tortilla. Everything was absolutely delicious, their chef really knows flavor and taste. Also tried an awesome dessert and they were making many delicious-looking concoctions in the blenders/juicers as well.  The decor is awesome, reminds me of living in a loft apartment, very industrial-meets-modern and perfect for this type of restaurant. Prices were good as well. So maybe I don't need to eat animals every meal...",

I love the building that Luna's is located in plenty of windows for sunshine and beautiful hard wood flooring . This place has an ultra sleek big city metropolitan feel to it. I started my lunch with the falafel sampler and it was delicious it also came with a yummy hummus and delicious pickled vegetables. As my drink I tried the chai latte which is made in house it puts Starbucks to shame. As my main entree I had the Rawco Taco salad and thought I was in heaven . To top it all off I had dessert it was a pumpkin like cheese cake and it was amazing . Even if your not vegan this is a place that is a must try for everyone. The staff is friendly and the food is good for you and the planet ! It's a win win for everybody .",

My gps kept saying I was passing it, but I could not see it from the street (passed it from both directions).  I called, spoke with Chrissie or Kristy, who gave excellent directions.  It's located in the Atherton Mill parking lot where there are a bunch of other restaurants - closest is Ice House and is located next to/across from the Farmer's Market.  Now that I know where it is, I will be sure to not get lost and get there when the kitchen is still open to enjoy a full meal.  Apparently the location changed recently and some of their offerings are no more, such as the alkaline water which was a bummer.. but they have carbon filtered water, which i'm not familiar with.. have to research that one.    People hang out and lounge even after the kitchen is closed.. it's a really lax, hip, artsy, healthy atmosphere.. good vibes!  People were super helpful and approachable.  People just came right up to me and spoke, which was really nice.  Prices are super high though.. i've never in my life purchased a pint? (approximately) of fresh juice for over $10.. that is insane!  but.. I wanted to give them a shot and support their local business.. all organic and vegetarian.  I chose the juice with beets, kale, spinach, orange, lemon, ginger and... not sure if i'm forgetting something or not.  I'll be drinking it tomorrow at work.  Never had beets before, so it should be an interesting experience.  Will update more later.",

I am so glad I found this place on a trip to Charlotte! I loved everything about it, the ambience, the food, and even the smell.  It is a very open concept restaurant with a rustic chic design. They have a fridge and a bar right at the entrance, where you can pick up quick eats and juices. They also have numerous tables for you to enjoy a meal.  The food was amazing! So flavorful, delicious and vegan! I had the Fire Burger, and it was OMG! Just the right amount of spice. The guacamole was really good, and the mix of the quinoa pattie with the sunflowerseed hummus was perfect. My side was the Oyster Mushroom Kale Salad, which was very fresh! I loved the ginger dressing.  For dessert I had the Berries Cheesecake. I never thought vegan could taste so good! Hands down to the cheesecake!!!  I also got a green juice for tomorrow. I am sure it will be just as good.  I am definately coming back whenever in charlotte (maybe even tomorrow...lol)",

Now we were looking at the pictures of the different meals and by the time we arrived, we didn't know what to order.  Thank God for Cassandra, she was our server as she knows her stuff! She told us what was good, better and best for newbie Vegan eaters. The Mrs order the Kitchen Sink, no really she ordered the WHOLE kitchen sink and a \"pizza\"! Very impressive meal, the pizza with NO animal by products was exquisite! My wife ate her WHOLE meal and we were supposed to share the salad! I ordered the avocado and basil sandwich and a cup of lentil soup. OMG, you could have told me salmonella was on my sandwiches and I still would have eaten it! It was delicious!",

My favorites were the Rawco Taco salad, Kale Caesar salad, Daily Green Salad, the Fire & Brimstone Burger, and the Turtle Cake.  Traveling for work means that I'm eating out 4/7 days of the week, so finding restaurants that aren't just vegan and delicious but truly healthy is crucial but difficult. Living Kitchen checked all those boxes!  Additionally, the vibe in side was top notch -- it's industrial but natural at the same time and it's welcoming and bright.",

Clean vegan eating.   The purple rain juice i ordered was vey refreshing. My mom ordered the pho and portion wise it was kind of small. They pour the broth in after they put the entree on the table.

Their unsweetened lemonade was delicious and refreshing as well as the chocolate chaga.

There were some pros and cons and they are listed below:  CONS: - The cauliflower coconut soup could have been hotter. It was on the warm side and I like my soup hot. - The iced chai was a little watered down.   PROS: - The avocado basil sandwich was delicious! It actually inspired me to possibly order something similar to it in my hometown. I always thought, \"What's the point of ordering something so simple?\" Well, that mindset just changed after eating here. - The service is great. - The interior of the restaurant is trendy and cool.  So when it comes down to it, the ultimate question is this: Would I come back?   My Answer: Definitely.",

I go to the front and someone finally comes over and I advise it's just one so he asks if I'd like to sit at the bar. I said sure that's fine and I sit waiting for ANYONE to acknowledge this young black woman sitting before them. They never did, not even when I got up and walked out.

I came at lunchtime and the place was pretty busy, the only available seating was at the bar and at tables with stools. However being pregnant I asked to sit on the couch and await one of the tables with cushioned seating to come available while I check out the menu. The hostess agreed and as I waited I watched several people come in for pick ups as this place does pretty good from what I observed. My table become available a short 5-10 mins after I sat to wait.  The hostess sat me and I immediately ordered the sweet potato roll as I read all good things and a Green juice. Once it came out I devoured the roll it was so yummy I mean super yummy  and the sauce was pretty perfect as a compliment to the roll.  I went on to order a Avocado sandwich minus the sprouts as I can't have sprouts pregnant. The sandwich was yummy the only complaint I have is that the bottom bread was about 4times smaller than the top so I couldn't eat it like a sandwich as I observed others who ordered the sandwich eat it. Instead I had to eat it with a knife and fork.  My server was awesome I believe her name was Sasha she was very informative and attentive. I'll be back as there is another item I wanted to try that I just couldn't consume on this visit.",

There are tons of employees always working but they just act super nonchalant and could care less about providing prompt service. Just this afternoon, it took 30 minutes to get two 16oz smoothies when there were only 2 people dining in!! Literally the place was empty. 10 of those minutes were spent looking for cups and lids. After it took 3 people to find cups and lids, my final smoothie was put in a 12oz cup and I had to ask the girl for the extra that was left (which really wasn't extra since I purchased 16oz). My visit before this, I suggested to a manager they add the nutritional information online to ALL juices. He tried to argue and say none of the drinks had nutritional information online. So I had to pull it up for him and show him so he would believe what I was saying. He then said that they don't normally and I just asked that he ask ownership to do so for the drinks missing it. A place priding themselves on healthy living should have nutritional information. What makes me so annoyed is that this literally was my favorite place for juices and smoothies. Thankfully Clean Juice is popping up everywhere because the service and quality of Luna's no longer justifies the $10 juices.",

From the open-arm welcome at the door until the commencement of our meal, good vibes were all around. This is a fantastic place for a date-night, casual evening drop-in, work station, and even bar for anyone who wants to escape the commotion all around. Highly recommend this place for every activity I just mentioned and I want to thank the entire staff (especially the kitchen) for a kickass experience. Much love!",

Perfect mix of sweet and coffee and floral deliciousness. This alone gets the 5 stars.  Got the living burrito with a side of kale Caesar. So. The living burrito. Literally will make you forget you're eating straight veggies disguised as a burrito. Such good flavors and the lettuce wrap just makes it a million times better. The salsa on the side is a great spice to add.   Kale Caesar has great flavor, perfect side for when you just wanna add some greens in there.   So many things to come back and try because I am so into this menu!",

Last time we were in Charlotte we dropped in for some lunch and were kept full the rest of our road trip thanks to their delicious food!   I got the manicotti, which I was skeptical about being served cold with veggie noodles, BUT this was amazing! The veggie noodles are tender and the cashew cheese inside is creamy and decadent. Yum!    I love the light-filled atmosphere of this place with all the plants trendy fixtures. We dined in and our server was so nice with a great attention to detail. They even gave us some ice for leftovers bag to keep our food cold until we reached home. This restaurant is a gem and I would definitely go back!!",

The lunasagna was cold and something short of the amazingness that lasagna usually is, but the salad dressing (earthy like tahini) that came with the side salad made up for it . The veggie burger was a large patty between two slices of bread (versus a normal bun) and was also something short of the amazingness that a burger usually is. This isn't a knock on vegetarian cuisine, but rather saying that there's room for improvement.  It was a great place to sit and chill with an (alcoholic) drink and people watch on a rainy day. I would definitely do it again, and save more room for the sweets in the two fridges up front (chia seeding pudding, cookies, macaroons, juices).",

If you like raw, you'll be pleased. But be prepared to waaaaait. I had the falafel appetizer, lunasagna with the side salad. (Posted a picture) The hemp salad dressing was amazing! But the lunasagna was just ok. Not really a fan of raw to be honest, so probably not the best choice of restaurants. But I'm from out of town and didn't know until the cab dropped me off! Oops.   They made up for the just ok dinner with the pumpkin pie- it was the best I've ever had. Wow. Can't say enough about it.   Atmosphere- old rock music that is too loud for my tastes.

First off the place was bright, spacious, sparkling clean and so inviting.  They did a fantastic job designing this place.  It also has a dog friendly patio which is AWESOME!    I sat at the bar since I was alone and was greeted by a couple very welcoming, smiles across their faces ladies.  Each was very helpful with menu explanations and gave superb recommendations to this first timer here.  They also periodically gave me and the gentleman next to me small samples of the smoothies they just made.  This was very considerate of them instead of washing the tiny extra bit down the sink.  And the Pina colada smoothie was the bomb!  Now I'm not a diehard vegan or RAW foodie, but this place could make it happen.  I had the lunasagna and it was bursting with flavor in every single mouth watering bite!  Everything was fresh and delectable!  I really wanted to lick my plate, but thought that would be unacceptable - ha!  I also had the komucha beer and it was tangy, crisp and enjoyable.  Now - how can I get them to come to Houston ... this is really the big question!",

Honestly you can't go wrong with any item that you might select from the menu. Every plate is Instagram-worthy and so delectable. The desserts are also exceptionally good!

I have some in my refrigerator that the kids KNOW not to touch or there will be hell to pay!  Even if you are not vegan you will enjoy this place.

Every time I go I end up with the Caesar or tuna or one of the delicious burgers and my pockets can't afford to do all so I have to go in rounds but seriously the Caesar is so good it's hard to NOT get it.

It's great knowing that at any moment that I get hungry I have an entire menu of delicious food, smoothies, juices, teas ... and now even coffee, wine, or dessert! Great menu expansions, and trust me you will never guess those desserts are vegan.

Although I could see it was constantly very busy, but the whole time nearly half the tables were empty so that was confusing. They should add more seats at the bar because a lot of people just ended up ordering takeout since we couldn't get seats. The orders took very long but I have to say the food is very good. I got the living burrito which was great. Very fresh ingredients and the green wrap is such a wonderful alternative to any bread item. It also came with a spicy salsa and a soup. I got the sweet potato chili and that was a nice spicy balance to the cold entree and juice. It can get quite pricey but they are quality ingredients and you will feel good with good food. The chaotic waiting area and wait time were the downside.",

(If you do drive, Luna's does have a big open parking lot. It's not bad, I'm just picky)  The atmosphere and service are fantastic. It has high ceilings, tons of natural light, and really lovely modern decor. Loved our server, she was very sweet and knowledgeable of the menu.   I'm not a vegan, but I'm always looking for good vegan places to take my vegan sister when she's in town. She ordered an iced coffee with her meal and I ordered the best iced chai I've ever had. (seriously, wow)  I love a good veggie burger and I was not at all disappointed with the one I ordered. I've eaten quite a few vegan restaraunt meals with sis but this was my first time eating somewhere that boasts itself as \"raw vegan\". Luna's does a fantastic job blending different flavors and ingredients to create it's dishes and I truly did not miss the absence of meat OR heat in my meal.  I have no idea what raw vegan cheesecake is made of but the berry cheesecake I ordered was incredible  Two drinks, two entrees, and two desserts ran me about $50. I certainly couldn't afford to eat here on the regular, but It was a special night out, so it was worth the splurge.",

Water was delivered immediately as we sat down which I like. The menu is laid out pretty easily so it shouldn't be hard to figure out what you want. I decided on the Lunasaga. I can't stress how incredibly delicious it is. The sauce was very good and had a great after taste. I also got the local greens salad and I added garlic since I love garlic. Delicious! The dressing is a hemp dressing. It tasted like a mix between a ranch and a Caesar dressing. I'm pretty sure I cleaned my plate in under 10 mins. It was THAT good. Of course I couldn't pass on dessert. I opted for the turtle cake which was rich but not overwhelmingly rich. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. My friend ordered the milk and cookies. You get a choice of milk. She likes regular milk but that wasn't an option. She got hemp milk that I enjoyed. The cookies are chocolate chip. Very moist and delicious. Before you leave, check out the stuff in the fridge by the bar. I got the antidote and the protector shots along with the hemp dressing that was on my salad. My experience was awesome! The service was awesome too! Except a little longer than normal on food, it's absolutely worth it! Enjoy!",

Again, cause this time I knew what I was getting myself into. Throughly enjoyed the living burrito with the garden salad. The ingredients are treated with so much respect that your plate of food is almost like a mini work of art.   The husband ordered the pad thai and thought it was good, although it was a bit of a loose interpretation of the dish. It was however more filling than other plates we have had here in the past.   The service is a bit slow and the atmosphere a touch on the pretentious side, but I am grateful that there are places like this around that cater to those that like to eat on the healthier side.  Other note is that the unsweet tea was a bit odd, but after I drank a couple glasses, I am rather taken with it now. It seemed to have a hint of vanilla which surprised me at first.",

My husband is not vegetarian but he has some food allergies and usually is very hard to go to somewhere we can trust, so his nutritionist told him about this place that is just 5 minutes from our home. I ordered the Living Burrito with Broccoli Waldorf on the side and the Lemon-Berry Cheesecake for desert, everything was delicious specially the desert! My husband loved it too! I wish I could eat there everyday or learn how to cook like that!   The place looks clean, the decoration is nice and our server did a really good job (she knew everything about the restaurant and the food).",

Today I got a protein smoothie, the Popeyes Punch, which is my favorite. I decided to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. After a few minutes even though I clearly had my smoothie, a server (or maybe hostess) came and told me that she needed the table (while the customers were standing right next to her)!  Not only that, but there were at least 3 other empty tables on the patio! I can understand maybe it was because I had just a smoothie but a paying customer is a paying customer and there was no need to kick me off the table like that. I can't say that I'm going to boycott but that just rubbed me the wrong way. This is what happens when a small business becomes a big one. The loyalty and respect fades away unfortunately.",

I wasn't too crazy about the house made ginger ale, but I loved my rawco taco salad. It was so fresh and delicious. I also got a cacao cacao smoothie and it exceeded my expectations. If I lived in Charlotte, I could see myself stopping in for a to-go smoothie on the regular.   The service was a little bit slow and the waitress was kind of absent...but I chalked it up to either being really busy or the fact that I was eating alone. I don't know!   Overall, the salad and smoothie outweighed anything semi off putting. I also really loved the big windows that let in tons of natural light! The interior is really clean and modern-looking with small vases of fresh flowers on every table. Loved that little touch!  Thanks, guys for some delicious food! :)",

People love this place and there's good reason.  Fresh ingredients and a creative kick to otherwise bland and boring dishes.  I was bowled over at how much I actually liked the meal I had and since have had even after my first visit.  Interiors are open and light is abundant by way of the large windows.  Trendy interiors compliment the rustic brick and wood accents.  Parking is a bit of bear here with the entire Afton Mill area having other great things like the market and Savory Spice Shop as well as Big Ben's.",

My friend's dish was also bland and the amount of coconut pudding in the glass was rediculiuos. It was a serving size for a little child. I was very disappointed today.

    "text": "This restaurant proves that you do not need to be vegan to enjoy vegan fare. I think that's really important to note first. The food here is great!   My girlfriend and I met up for a walk on the rail trail one day and at the end of our walk we decided to stop in for a juice. We each got a delicious pressed juice and said we would have to come back for food on a later date.   We'll that date came! And I was really impressed. The server was so sweet. She offered us water (wish it came in larger glasses). We studied the menu. My friend got the kale Caesar salad. I ordered the manicotti.   Both meals came promptly. Her salad was tasty, but the real winner was my dish! The \"manicotti\" was comprised of raw zucchini lasagna zoodles stuffed with cashew cheese and touched with tomato sauce. I got a tossed arugula salad on the side. That cashew cheese was to die for!! No joke! So good! My only wish was that the manicotti could be served warm. I think it would push it over the top -- nonetheless, totally delicious! We ended our meal with 2 chocolate chip cookies and a class of almond milk. The cookies were great. They came warm with lots of nutty flavor. However, I'd pass on the almond milk next time -- too sweet.   The actual space is beautiful and eclectic. It's pretty spacious too.   Nice staff, beautiful space, great food -- if you aren't a vegan don't despair, it's a great choice for lunch! If you are vegan - lucky you because it's such a great example that vegan food isn't scary and can be SO tasty!",

Love the light fixtures, artwork, pillows, etc. Staff are always top notch.  It's an oasis.    Lots to choose from on the menu.  A few favorites are the Pad Thai with zucchini and sweet potato noodles and the Avocado Basil sandwich.  The Biblical Breakfast is awesome...artisanal bread topped with peanut butter, almond butter, fig jam, banana...so delicious and satisfying.  I could have that everyday.  Love the drinks too...kale lemonade, smoothies, lavender cappuccino,etc.   Highly recommended!",

The food, while quite healthy, is very tasty.  The desserts are a little small for the price, but the entrees are a good size and are quite filling.  If you're looking to eat something healthy without sacrificing a lot of flavor, this place really hits the spot, especially if you are trying to avoid gluten.  The sweet potato sushi roll is so good.  The sweet potato mixed with the cashews is not starchy and definitely gives it a great texture.  The tomatico tart is my favorite thing on the menu.  The crust is very rich and tasty, plus the cashew marscapone adds a divine creaminess.  I wish it had just a bit more tomato (because I love tomatoes so much), but it's still ridiculously tasty and filling.  The living burrito is surprisingly large and very filling (who would have thought that raw collard greens could be so tasty?).  I haven't tried any of the juices or smoothies, but they certainly look tasty.  Their menu is relatively small, but the menu items I've tried have been delicious.  The portions are a decent size, as I always leave satisfied.  The wait staff is friendly and willing to make recommendations.  I've been quite pleased on both visits to Living Kitchen, and I definitely think this will be my go-to place when I'm craving something healthy.",

My absolute favorite thing here: the volcano juice (orange, lemon, grapefruit, maple syrup, cayenne). Food-wise, I usually get the Fire & Brimstone burger (gluten free quinoa veggie burger spiced with sunflower hummus, onion, cucumber, guac, homemade hot sauce). You can get it on bread or wrapped in a collard leaf.   The inside is beautiful. Cozy tables along with a long community one. Stools along the bar-like counter. Nice patio if you want to be outside.   I noticed a few people comment about both the price and the fact the food is all cold. Come on people, it's raw. And this isn't McDonald's.",

I don't want to take my business elsewhere so hopefully someone in management will see this!!  While I LOVE the concept of Luna's and want to support their efforts to sell clean, organic food, I believe a few things need to change BADLY:  1. Better management: when more than a quarter of the restaurant is full, the wait staff struggle. It often takes 15-20 minutes before I get water, and another 15 before I can order.   2. I often order over the phone (2-3 times per week), and I usually have to call 2-3 times before someone answers. Every time I give the benefit of the doubt and assume they are busy and can't answer. Not the case.  At all. There was one customer to 4 employees when I walked in!  3. Portions are starting to get skimped on. For $7.50 you can fill the chia pudding beyond a small half cup.   4. I had a screw in my turmeric latte. Yes, a screw! I barely got an apology and then was asked to bring the screw back.  What kind of customer service is that? I'm sorry you have college kids running the place, but someone needs to teach them customer service skills for the price people pay to enjoy the food.",

Eating at lunas, you can tell everything is super fresh. The veggie burger was ok, a little dry. The mock tuna and avocado basil sandwich were very good ! The hummus trio was good (curry was my fav), but with the quantity of dipping options they give you (cucumber, carrots, crackers) youd need 3 orders of the hummus to use on them. It wasnt even enough for my toddler. At first i thought they brought just the veggies/crackers separate from the hummus.. then i noticed the tiny melon scooper sized hummus balls in the bowl.  The caesar salad was also really yummy. I would say the price you pay and the portion size don't match up. From other reviews I see, it seems I'm not the only one to feel this way. But the food was pretty good, and again, you can't get this food just anywhere so I understand the pricing, but there needs to be a little more food for the price ranges.",

    "text": "Ummmm....yummmmm....that is the best way for me to start with this review.  Luna's certainly exceeded my expectations with my first visit!!!  The atmosphere was lively as soon as we walked through the door! We were promptly greeted...added to the wait list and given a reasonable time for a table.  The wait allowed us to observe and talk about food...and restaurants...and was seated in no time.  Our table located near the large bright windows overlooking the Blue Line....so great view of the outside and the view of the restaurant.  OK...back to the ...ummmmmm .....yummmmmm!  We spent some time reviewing the various selections...of appetizers and then the entrees...and the great specialty drinks.   The decision on the appetizers were promptly made and later I knew why we could not settle for just one!!  The Falafel Sampler was simply amazing.  The flavors of the falafel were like none I have ever tasted.  The olives...coated nicely in a very nice pesto were so good.  So the debate started...which were better....olives or falafel?  Well...it was a toss up.  So time to move on to try the carrots and cauliflower!  OK...so now this is why they say \"homemade\" pickles.  Oh these veggies had been pickled in a nice vinegarette...that added enough zing to cleanse the palette before returning to the olive v. falafel challenge.  Ohhhh ummmmmmm....yummmmm!  Just too good to pronounce a winner!  In the meantime...just a few more minutes to review the entrees...and sample the drinks.  The \"ginger ale\" was just spicy enough and effervescent and fizz to quench your thirst. Very nice ginger ale! Had I tasted the ginger ale prior to having the kale lemonade...I may have had both!!!  (see photos) They were very good and tasty!!!  and went well with the appetizer.   Entree time.....So what is the recommended favorite of the day.... well after finishing the nice portioned appetizer...you are almost tempted not to order any entree...but the Rawco Taco Salad drew top bid...and was the selection.  And let me tell  you.... uummmmmm....yummmmm!!!  Just a great salad that was so beautiful that it looked like a work of art!  (see photo).  Everything arranged so perfectly for taking just a small amount of each ingredient to sample from this huge salad.  OK...as I paused just to admire such a great salad...I was quickly prompted to try the walnut almond crumbles and sour cream sitting nicely in front of the fresh sprouts (OK...will get to those later)  So...the forkful of walnut almond topping just drove my taste buds crazy.  And...then I was prompted to try it with the raw crackers that were made with sesame seeds .....ohhhhhh so so so good! I am thinking...can a salad get better than this...well it got better.  The pico de gallo had a surprise blast of heat from the peppers....so yummy....the avocado...with spices so very good...and all of this sitting on top of an amazing fresh crunchy bowl of greens!!!  Now the sauce....just a nice little ramekin of goodness...with a little sprinkle of sesame seeds on top....but the flavor was so good.  I had to keep tasting trying to figure out how you make such great flavors......ummmmmm yummmmm!!!! Now we are asking \"where is this chef so we can give some high fives and kudos\"!  And just as we wrapped up the salad (big enough for 2) pondered whether we had had enough....as we searched the front and back of the main menu searching for desserts.  Our server...nice as she could be...graciously mentioned her favorites from the separate menu she provided..... and this was minutes after we spent a few minutes talking about chocolate upon chocolate...and who liked carrots....and halwa....and pudding and other decadent desserts to compare to what was on the menu!!!  Decision time....my lunch partner left it all up to me....and... easy decision.... Who can resist chocolate upon chocolate upon chocolate infused with garnacha?  Not at this table.  So....Dulce de Amor was the easy choice.  so...ohhhh my \"sweet love\" or my \"love of sweet\"!  Just the reaction as I looked across the table and observed the expression as just a nibble was sampled.  Goodness.....goodness...goodness...when it comes to great food...there is no lying in the eyes and the smile. When the eyes close....you know that the dessert has taken you to another place!!!!  Yes...the eyes close...maybe to see pecans being mixed with chocolate...and drizzled with raspberry couli!!!  It is rare that restaurants are good enough to push anything out of my top 5....well... Luna's is that rare find!!!  Thank you PG for great recommendation...and sharing this great experience!!!",

    "text": "Visited Charlotte with a group of friends and decided to try this place. We tried the sweet potato sushi roll, living burrito, rawco taco salad, lunasagna and avocado & basil sandwich with broccoli waldorf. My favorite dishes were the rawco taco salad and avocado & basil sandwich. The sandwich is on multigrain bread and it's delicious. It gives the sandwich a really nice bite. Overall, the food was all very flavorful, fresh, and had a lot of texture. My only critiques are the lunasagna was too salty for my liking and we received somewhat slow service considering we were there for a late lunch. There were maybe three other small tables besides us. Therefore, I give Luna's Living Kitchen 4 stars and would visit again when in town.",

I was skeptical that I'd like the raw lasagna, but the cashew cheese was expertly flavored. We even used some of it on the burger that was a tiny bit dry. Great meal overall...we'll be back!",

We started with the gluten free sourdough bread appetizer. My husband had the Fire and Brimstone burger (very good - coming from a burger lover). I had the Manicotti with salad side, both very fresh. Washed that down with Ginger Ale. Topped the evening off with Turtle Cake and Lemon Berry Cheesecake. Both desserts were scrumptious. Excellent food, friendly service and welcoming atmosphere. Why can't there be more restaurants like this out there??",

The menu is so strange why must you re create hummus isn't that vegan any way. The lowmein-ish salad was odd and cold when it was supposed to be a warm dish. The juice cleanse non sense is so trendy is makes me laugh. Come here and buy over priced prepackaged juice drinks. People if it's pre packed it's not fresh. The only thing was edible was the bread and that was Ezekiel and that was the only thing they didn't make.I mean I understand the vegan trend as it goes hand in hand with the Paleo lemmings but go to Bean if you want good vegan food.  Side bar no one looked happy before, during or after they ate",

I ordered a coffee that I just couldn't drink, because of the alternative milk concoction that I had optimistically tried. The waitress was completely understanding and removed it from my bill. Bring your fat wallet. It's not for those on a budget, but the quality is clearly top shelf, local, organic and quite tasty.",

I was so very nearly in tears when I read the menu as I could eat almost everything on it, and they were more than willing to make changes so that everything was suitable for me.  I love that their menu does not offer the normal fake meats, and highly processed foods that so many restaurants think constitutes vegan food. There are many vegans who eat whole foods and find that they cannot eat at most restaurants who cater to vegans.  it was such a treat to be faced with a menu where everything could be made GF, and everything came from whole foods.  Their food is absolutely delicious!   So much so, that my friend and I made a detour on Sunday to eat there before we drove back to Norfolk, VA.  I've only tried 5 things from the menu, but so far, the sweet potato sushi and the veggie burger in a collard wrap are my absolute favorites. I'm always plotting my next trip down to Charlotte.",

When we first sat down, I was pretty hungry, so I was worried this wouldn't be enough food, but it was surprisingly filling and very delicious. That same meal, my boyfriend ordered the Fire and Brimstone Burger and said he really enjoyed it and didn't feel like his meal wasn't complete without meat!  More recently I took my parents here for Sunday brunch, a new Luna's offering, because my mom is trying to eat healthier and low sugar.  Per my recommendation she ordered the Arugula Harvest Salad and also loved it! I ordered the Muesli and was a little disappointed. It was served in a small bowl and, while filling, was pretty bland and unexciting: not my expectation for Sunday brunch. My boyfriend ordered the Sweet Potato Sushi Roll and was warned upon ordering that it's on the small side (tip for you), so he ordered a cup of their daily soup on the side. My dad, the meat and potatoes guy in our group, ordered the Biblical Breakfast, which he said was fine, but definitely not his favorite either. I think fig preserves and peanut butter was a weird combo personally.  All in all, lunch is great, but if you come for brunch, don't expect a hot meal.",

First and foremost, kudos to the servers in the Fairview location, they rock!!! Super friendly, they all know very well their menus and how to explain taste profile to those not so vegan friendly, if you get served by Jesus he is the best! The food here is very very tasty, they can go a little too spicy so make sure you ask your server, they have a very creative menu from the names to obviously the choices. I LOVE LOVE that their desserts are all Gluten Free and the cheesecake berry one is to literally fight for! Another must have desert is their cookies and milk, the almond coconut mix milk is super rich and delicious. My best dishes are the avocado toast sandwich (so glad they kept it in their now new menu), the quesadilla with mushroom carnitas , and omg their burger is a must try! Their drinks and smoothies are really natural, clean and fresh. Also very creative flavor combinations, be ware with the ginger one as it is very spicy and will leave you hot hot hot! I love their little center pieces always with fresh wild flowers, their plates and glass collection is super cute too. I love they do not serve water with ice unless you ask. People, water is intended to be drank 'al natural'. They only advise and heads up I have is related to their prices. Desserts average around $9 per plate, entrees around $12-$16 and with exception of their salads, their portions are not big, just enough. For me it's perfect and coming from the North East I see these all priced fairly, but for the portions and considering  most dishes carry lots of leaves it can be considered in the pricier end. I LOVE LOVE their branding, vision and concept. They are definitely game changers and challenge the status quo of the restaurant industry. They have come to join the food and sustainability revolution and I love it!!! Keep up the great work and much more success your way!",

I live in South Florida and I wish we had one of these in the area. I might actually be persuaded to go vegan. Also loved that almost everything is gluten free (which I do try to avoid). A must try!",

I went in just to pick up a shot of \"the antidote\" to help flush out a little cold, but was intrigued by a plate that came out of the open kitchen area. I grabbed a seat at the bar area and decided to give vegan a try.   I ordered the mock tuna salad in a collard wrap with a side of beet salad and there's only one word to describe it, delicious. It was very flavorful, and quite filling. The nut and seed mixture within the mock salad was crunchy and creamy at the same time, reminiscent of the celery crunch and creamy mayo, but without the guilt. I will definitely be back for that, and some other treats again!",

It had a hearty almond crust that had warm buttery flavor! It was filled with a cashew creme and topped with appropriately dressed greens, and a random slice of mushroom. My only complaint is I was under the impression I ordered a tomato tart? It only had two halved cherry tomatoes? I expected more tomatoes for a tomato tart. Also it did take a long time for my food to get to me. I sat solo at the bar. The manager even came up to me and said it will just be a moment longer. Once I got my food I was ignored by the service, so I couldn't ask about the tomato situation? I have it 4 stars because the food was quality and tasted good, but not 5 stars bc the service was not was I anticipated.",

I would recommend the manicotti, the Fire & Brimstone burger, and the avocado and basil sandwich. That being said, the service is oftentimes verging on horrendous. The hostess is extremely rude, standoffish, and not at all friendly. She also tends to exaggerate the time needed to get a table. Told us 25 mins and we waited 45. She also asked if my party of four would like to \"split up\" and sit at two separate tables so as to be seated faster. Why would I come to lunch with my family, only to be split up with them? I was very confused by that, even though I think she was trying to help? We also waited well over half an hour for our food. Long story short, I will keep coming back because the food is amazing, but they REALLY need to find better service for their delicious restaurant.",

The caramel sauce is made with dates so it really wasn't as flavorful as what I am accustomed to a caramel sauce tasting like, however the coconut milk made it so delicious. After tip it was a $10 coffee so I am glad I enjoyed it. We ordered the cranberry walnut bread to start. It was a nice sized portion but we should have ordered the almond butter instead of coconut butter for the spread. For dinner, we had the Caesar salad and the Rawco taco salad. The Caesar needs more. The dressing was flavorful and I liked it but I would have enjoyed some tomatoes and red onion or something other than just lettuce and dressing on an $11 dish. The taco salad was very good and had lots of interesting elements. Wonderful dressing.  For dessert we had a dense chocolate cake with a nutty crust. Very nice flavor and perfect if you just need to satisfy a sweet tooth. The service is good and the space is beautiful and relaxing. A bit on the pricey side, but understandable for the concept they are so expertly executing.",

Love the spiciness, the hummus and Guac as condiments, and the burger itself had such a rich flavor. Had it with the local greens salad which was just delicious as well. For dessert, I had a layered pie with white and dark chocolate mousse on a pecan crust with raspberry coulis. I'm describing it because I can't remember the name, but I will not soon forget the taste! Beautiful flavor without too much sweetness.

This is the first time I've ever had cashew cheese and it was delicious. The manicotti was phenomenal, especially with the tomato-basil marinara. I also got to taste my sister's pad Thai which was just as good. We will definitely be back. It's amazing how good healthy, raw food can taste. I'm about to order the lemon berry cheesecake and I'm so excited to see how they pull off vegan cheesecake!",

We came here for dinner and ordered:  -Grey Hulk smoothie: 5/5 Naturally sweet and delicious. I would come back just for this.  -Power Pack shots: 4/5 Powerful hits of raw juice! Wish they came in glass shot rather than in plastic bottles though.  -Arugula Harvest Salad: 3.75/5 Pretty decent salad (I love sprouts), but salad is pretty much the default option you get if you're a vegan in a steakhouse, so given so many options at Living Kitchen, I'd order other dishes next time.  -Sweet Potato Sushi Roll: 3/5 Interesting....This is good if you're going for the no carb / no rice diet, but to be honest I've had better vegan sushi (with rice).  -Curry Bowl: 4/5 One of my favorite bowls of the night. Bigger portions than expected.  -Broccoli Mushroom Pizza: 3.5/5 A bit dry. I wouldn't consider it pizza. Think of it more as some toppings on a graham-like cracker crust. I wouldn't order this again.  Service was friendly and attentive as well. I would come back again for healthy vegan food in my future travels to Charlotte.",

There are high tables, regular tables, wooden chairs, cozy couches, modern art, and lots of beautiful plants scattered throughout. Definitely a hip vibe.   The menu options are all plant based and organic. On my visit I got the Macrobiotic Bowl which included adzuki beans, quinoa, kale, roasted sweet potatoes, sauerkraut, and a lemon tahini dressing. Sooo good. I loved my bowl. I've only had adzuki beans (red beans) in a traditional Chinese style soup before so I was amazed at how tasty it was in this dish as well. I was also a fan of my friend's Curry Bowl, which had curried lentils, quinoa, kale, roasted cauliflower, pickled cabbage, tomatoes, and chimichurri sauce. Both filled us up!  I'm so glad I discovered this place, and know I'll be frequenting it a lot more so I can try all the other grain bowls and salads. Their lattes and desserts sound amazing as well. Highly recommend for anyone, even a non vegan/vegetarian like myself!",

App (\"cheese\" plate with gf crackers), bottle of wine (Garnacha from Spain), two entrees (curry bowl and avocado basil sandwich on gfbread) and dessert (cashew raspberry cheesecake). Three hours later we realized it was almost 10 pm! Everything was delightful, creative and filling. We were beyond stuffed. Bursting!! Hubby and I agree that even if you're a carnivore this place rocks. You won't be left wanting. :)  Will buy the cheese plate appetizer every time. Wow.   Was our sweet server's first day. Cute little brunette. Wish I remembered her name. She was fantastic. Professional, unobtrusive and eager to answer all our questions even if she had to go ask (like \"HOW MUCH TO BUY A WHOLE CHEESECAKE??!!!)--$69 btw. Me thinks worth it ;)",

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the service was slow, but it seemed like they were training new staff, so that is understandable. Ok, so really cool atmosphere that is modern and bright (makes you feel healthy). The food was also superb. I am not vegan, but dang I thought about turning vegan after trying the unique and delicious dishes. First off, the appetizer of the sweet potato sushi roll was good, but lacked a certain depth of flavor by itself. When you dipped it in the sauce it totally transformed into a wonderful sweet and umami taste. The main entrees we got were the living burrito (Definitely a classic that you gotta try). We also got the chipotle quesadilla, which was recommended, and did not disappoint. Tasted incredibly like a real quesadilla! There were so many good menu items, it was hard to choose, but next time I want to try the pad thai bowl!",

However, the only reason I can't give it 5 stars, is because some of the menu items just do not fill you up. Some of them do, and I wind up sticking to those handful of items. But it just sort of stinks that I have to avoid over half of a delicious menu, because the items are more like a snack than a meal.

The indoor space is comfortable, immaculate and service is very good.  They have an awesome outdoor area on the rail trail that is pretty quiet (except when a train passes for honestly 2 seconds) so it's a nice change of pace on that patio space versus other outdoor dining areas in Charlotte.  I will say, I wish they would get a little bit on the macro train and list the breakdown of carbs/fats/proteins on their menu. They focus really on clean, natural, gluten free, vegan flavors, which i TRULY appreciate on so many levels, but at the very least, I feel like this should be a standard here to go a step further of inclusive dietary lifestyles so I don't have to eyeball how many grams of blueberries are going into my smoothie.

    "text": "Visited here for the first time last night. While I am not vegan or vegetarian, I definitely appreciate what Living Kitchen is doing, and had a great experience. I can't see myself rushing back anytime soon, just because the food is not really my style. Let's start with the pros -   -atmosphere - GORGEOUS. One of the most beautiful spaces I've been in here in Charlotte. Reminds me of the new Suffolk Punch that's just down the rail trail. Lots of natural light, beautiful plants, bold and bright artwork. Absolutely stunning. I also love that there are cushions and pillows on the seats. My party last night had a baby and we didn't even need a highchair because he was comfortable between his parents in the soft booth!  -service - exceptional. Started the evening with one wonderful woman, who was really kind and genuine and made us feel so welcomed and relaxed. Her shift ended halfway through our meal and we had another sweetheart come over to take care of us! They were both so accommodating and attentive - best service I've had anywhere, in a long time.  -prices - reasonable. You're getting clean, healthy, vitamin-rich food here - that stuff doesn't typically come cheap. I was surprised that the entrees were not pricey in the slightest. The smoothies are, granted, about $9-10, which is crazy high for a drink, but one of the girls I was with ordered one and it looked pretty darn good.   -food - eh. I'm torn because it's really just not my jam. I ordered the manicotti, which is an awesome concept! Zucchini \"noodles\"  - how cool. But sadly, cold manicotti is not something I'll be craving anytime soon. The sauce was good, the plate was pretty, but the cheese did not have any flavor whatsoever (not sure if it was vegan cheese or what) and the noodles would have been better hot. I get it, it's raw food. Doesn't mean I have to love it.  Luna's, you're awesome, and I'm so glad you exist for when vegan/vegetarian friends are in town, like they were last night. Just hope it doesn't hurt your feelings when I get to fly solo and choose a BBQ spot instead ;)",

The sauce was zingy and the burger was soft and mushy, unlike a burger at all. My hubby had the pear pizza. It was small and over cooked. We were both hungry when we left. He said my homemade recipes are waaay better. He appreciates my cooking even more!",

    "text": "This place is located in the perfect spot to get a bite to eat after shopping. We stopped in after Black Friday shopping and were pleasantly surprised of the friendly ambiance and vibe. The menu had lots of options for those who are vegan + gluten free (like me). I started with the kale lemonade, so delicious, thirst quenching and an energy booster. I also had the soup of the day which was rosemary cauliflower and it was divine. Then I had the mushroom and broccoli pizza, which was insanely good but insanely small. Felt like I took four bites of it and was done. Sad, because I wanted more. My husband got the brimstone burger and a side of spice slaw. His was good but super spicy dish all around, but at least his was more filling than mine. So to suffice I got two desserts (did I mention I was very hungry). I got the chocolate pudding (recommended for serious chocolate lovers) was rich and perfect and I got the dulce cake which was fantastic with a raspberry compote. I also had a dirty chai latte with coconut milk which was a nice pick me up but a fun spin with ginger and peppercorn to add some extra spice. Didn't taste too much chai though. Overall it was tasty but wish the portions were more fulfilling so I wouldn't have had to order half the menu to be satisfied.",

I ordered the raw Pad Thai and it took about 40 minutes to get to my table...and it wasn't particularly buzzing at the time so my cousin and I were really confused.  The presentation was really pretty, but not 40 minutes pretty.   Taste was not bad. I suppose as someone who eats cooked food regularly my palette for raw food is probably much different than someone who lives a raw lifestyle and consumes raw foods exclusively. That being said, I'm sure this place is a gem for them. For someone with many more options, I thought it was a little overpriced and not entirely worth the wait either",

I selected it because it was raw instead of how other restaurants prepare which is fried (I don't like).  In fact everything here is raw and they obviously make it all homemade. The falafel in and of itself was good (don't judge a book by its cover) but I wasn't crazy about the seasoning of the dips or the pickling of the vegetables. I really thought the seasoning was a little overpowering (garlicky) when I am really used to eating more raw food without alteration. But this again could be a personal preference on my part. Everything else was great and I would like to go back to try some other things.",

They serve healthy raw vegan food that is absolutely delicious; even if you're a meat lover.  *organic farmers, *seasonal produce, *family-owned farms, *organic, *living food, *plant-based cuisine  I love their coconut milk lattes. They are rich, creamy, and full of flavor!  I've been there several times. I usually go with their arugula harvest salad. The salad has arugula, red cabbage, spriralized root vegtables, avocado, pear, caramelized pecans, pumpkin seeds, raisins, homade cashew basil cheese (The cashew basil cheese literally tastes like legit cheese!) and maple mustard vinaigrette. I like to have falafel added on top. Their salads are giant, which I love, because they fill you up all day. The vegetables are always fresh and ripe.   I also like their tree of life juice. I'm obsessed with the jars that their juices come in. I like to keep them for to-go drinks and around the house. I usually drink their juices before a race.  They had a new item on the menu, sweet potato sushi! It had red bell peppers, cucumbers and arugula wrapped with sweet potato rice and nori leaves and garnished with a lightly spiced Thai chili sauce. I highly recommend these too!   Their whole grain vegan bread with almond butter is also a delicious side in the morning with their coffee.   Their collard green wrapped quinoa burgers are also a great option!  Another favorite of mine is the Lunasagna. It has layers of tender, crisp zucchini noodles, cahsew basil cheese, sun-dried tomato sauce and mushrooms. It's also served with a side salad. The Lunasagna was really good and I didn't think I'd like it because it was cold, but it was perfect!  Ive also ordered the avocado and basil sandwich. It was filled with fresh organic slices of avocado, tomato, onion, sprouts, basil, homemade lemon parsley hummus and cashew sour cream wrapped up in a collard green. You have the choice of vegan multigrain bread or collard greens. I like the collard greens because they are thick and strong; they don't fall apart like iceberg lettuce wraps. For my side, I had their broccoli Waldorf salad. It consisted of diced broccoli, green apple, celery, walnuts, raisin, red onions, homemade chasew mayonnaise, and lemon juice. I don't know how they do it because it didn't taste vegan. I felt like I was eating a summer broccoli waldorf salad drenched in mayonnaise. I'm so impressed.   I love Luna's atmosphere, their staff is very friendly and helpful, and the service is quick! I can't wait to try more on the menu!",

(I didn't care for the cookies)  What didn't I like ? The muesli and the brimstone burger. The burrito just tastes like a salad wrapped in leaves- id rather eat an actual salad honestly. It's definitely an excellent spot though!",

    "text": "First let me start by saying I live in Columbia SC. I used to travel to go to Living Kitchen back when it was Luna's Living Kitchen. I LOVED Luna's! The atmosphere and the service was great! The food was absolutely amazing and really creative. I haven't had the opportunity to try the food since they switched over to Living Kitchen but I had a friend coming down from Charlotte that bought me some food.  I was completely dissatisfied. I order the Living Burrito with a Broccoli Waldorf salad and the Sweet Potato Sushi. The burrito did not come with the hot sauce, no pico de gallo, no sunflower refried beans or srpouts and old guacamole. I basically got two giant collard leaves with cauliflower rice. It had absolutely no flavor at all. The broccoli salad had no flavor at all. It didn't even taste like broccoli or cashew mayo! I only tasted the raisins! The sushi was okay but I've had better in the past. The nori just seemed to be chewy and maybe that was due to the ride and the sauce was a tad bit too spicy but I'm not complaining about that. Overall, I really loved Luna's Living Kitchen but I will never eat here again. I felt it was a complete waste of money. And they got rid of the Turtle Cake which really got to me! That was my FAVORITE! I would order at least three and some to go on my trips! I would say I'd be back for some smoothies and juices but honestly at this point I'm afraid to try anything and it be a complete waste of money and time.",

Since I don't do bread (except for the occasional cheat meal), I ordered the falafel sandwich but minus the bread. They converted it into a beautiful lettuce wrap. Fresh and delicious.

I have been a patron for almost 2 years and I used to love this place. As the faces of the staff continue to change from vibrant, energetic, and fun to blank faced, talkative bar boys and girls, to \"smoothie NON-makers\" who struggle to remember the recipe ingredients, to \"deer in headlights\" managers, I've watched the quality in regard to customer service go down the tube. I waited for close to 7 minutes and eventually had to ask to be helped after being overlooked by not 1, 2, or 3 workers but a whopping 4 servers. How they happened to miss 1 of 2 customers standing in the front of a practically empty restaurant behooves me! I watched 2 servers laugh and joke at the bar for 5 minutes, so this was apparently more important than taking a freaking juice order (how difficult is that?). After waiting and being overlooked for a couple that walked in much later than me, I left without completing my order. Luna's is overpriced and seriously lacking in the quality of servers and respect for customers. They should take an energy shot and change the name to Luna's dead kitchen. I will obviously not be returning....",

I had the basil avocado sandwich on the best bread I've ever tasted with the Caesar side salad that has kale croutons. Heaven. The service was ok and the reason for the 4 stars. We were sat immediately we mentioned we had never been there before so I was hoping for a little more explanation of the menu but she was nice none the less. I ordered my sandwich without the vegan sour cream and onions but they came out on the sandwich anyway. The sour cream worked out and was delicious but I absolutely hate onions. Other than that the place was a definite return and soon at that. They have a great selection of juices in the cooler for taking with you and I have stopped in frequently for just those since as well. It's only a tad pricey but I guess that's the way it is now you have to pay for clean healthy food and at Luna's living kitchen it's worth it.",

    "text": "Looks great- like a page out of a loft kitchen in Dwell magazine- but often what looks good may not work for the intended function. As a restaurant, the space was not utilized well- a tiny waiting bench area, a bar counter that takes up more space than it offers in function, a small lounge of two chairs and a sofa that- I guess? is for waiting, that could host tables where customers could eat. It makes for a chaotic entryway where people stand or sit around in confusion. The cold, stylish lines of the renovated-warehouse-chic dining area are not kind to sound: one can't hear their friends across the table because of the clatter of commerce and other customers. The result, you both have to speak louder. Then that bounces around, and everyone has to speak louder- and so it goes. It could be fixed with sound dampeners on the ceiling or walls, which could easily be integrated into the look. It's restaurant 101, really. The food. No complaints, really. I didn't enjoy my lunasagna, but that is more of a personal aversion to limp zucchini, and the red sauce of the sundries tomato base was too strong somehow and didn't blend well with the nut cheese on top. I wasn't alone there, one of my group had the same opinion and couldn't finish his. The bill of my group was much higher than I'd expect, and I wonder if when the hipness wears off people will realize they can make the small portions of raw food at home much cheaper, and in a quiet setting.",

The \"tuna\" salad sandwich is awesome pared with the Waldorf salad as a side. Today they had chili as the soup of the day with just the right amount of spice. This is a favorite lunch stop when the hubby and I are out on a Saturday afternoon.",

My go to order is the Living Burrito but sometimes I like to mix it up with the Pad Thai. The juices are great, too, and at times I use them as meal replacements.   The hot sauce that accompanies the Living Burrito gives me life. If you like spicy, you'd love this sauce.  The service is always top notch and the (newish) space is gorgeous with plenty of natural light.",

That out of the way, I did find something unique that was not here the last time I visited. Living Kitchen is one of the restaurants that popped up on the yelp Radar. The parking in this area is insane. With the district area next to the old train tracks now gentrified and popular, the parking is out of date. It was near lunch and I found this place. It was a wonderful surprise to find such a unique place where Vegans and Vegetarians to dine without stigma and prejudice. I sat at the counter and was assisted by a bright, bubbly young lady, her name is Janet. She helped me figure out a dish and drink. It was truly a unique experience. There is a lot good in any City, but I know when I see and experience something Amazing and this place is it. It's a bit pricey, but if more people ate this way, the demand would justify a price and consciousness shift. If you are in Charlotte, then brave the traffic, the crowds and the noise and find a slice of joy and tantalize your taste buds. You will be glad you did.",

I'm not a vegan or vegetarian so I do not crave for the taste of raw food. However my meal was very satisfying. My lunch date enjoyed the food as well. He became a vegetarian 12 years ago so he absolutely love this place!! This was his first time at Luna's as well and he really like the food. We sat outside on the patio, ate lunch and enjoyed sharing dessert.   My meal was the LIVING BURRITO Sunflower seed refried beans, cauliflower rice, salsa verde, pico de gallo, onion, sprouts and cashew sour cream wrapped in a collard leaf. Served with a side of our house hot sauce and a local green salad   Date meal was the VEGGIE BURGER Veggie burger is dressed with onion, tomato served on multigrain bread and and salsa verde.  Accompanied by a local green salad.  BERRY CHEESECAKE delicious!!",

I understand that it's hard to find a good vegan place and based on other reviews it seems like this is what that looks like. My mom and I came to Luna after I picked her up from the airport one afternoon back in August. We sat outside, the weather was beautiful and our waitress was friendly. I ordered a sandwich, my mom a salad bowl and we shared the \"cheesecake\" for dessert. It seems like everything I ordered had a nut component to mimic the mouthfeel of dairy. I remember the broccoli Waldorf salad was good but I couldn't finish more than a few bits. The meal was fresh and I felt good eating it but I didn't feel full for long. I may just not be the niche customer Luna relies on.",

Zucchini is used for a lot of the pasta substitutes. And makes it feel light and airy to eat!  You feel full without feeling yucky by the end of the meal. Definitely order some of the delicious appetizers. Hummus x3, even the bread with nut butter and fig jam is great. And prices are very reasonable for the quality I have to say.   The location is super trendy. There is even an Anthropoligie moving in next door. And at the back of the shopping center I find there is no troubles with parking availability.   Finally the decor and service. I found the inside very simply and cleanly decorated. The chairs outside on the patio were comfortable and clean. The service was good, we were well attended and plates cleared quickly. Jars of water were placed a the table for your own refills... So smart!  If you haven't been, even if you aren't sure since its #veggie, give it a try. It won't disappoint!",

I stopped by after shopping at a few stores nearby and ordered 2 items, saving the second for later.  The living burrito(sunflower seed refried beans, cauliflower rice, pico, guac, sprouts, cashew sour cream, wrapped with a collard leaf) and the curry bowl(lentils, quinoa, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, tomatoes)  and to drink I tried the gingerale(fresh ginger juice, lemonade, sparkling water, coconut nectar).    Keep in mind the meals are made to order so it may take some time depending on what you order.  The living burrito was not my favorite so I probably wouldn't order that again but the curry bowl was pretty amazing and definitely will require repeated visits when in the area. The portions are pretty huge so bring your appetite or save some for later.  The gingerale was pretty good, very refreshing and flavorful as well.",

Short wait for a table, well worth waiting. We ordered hummus and the Guacamole for appetizers, the guacamole was delicious quite possibly the best that I have ever had. Carrot and beet hummus who knew? They were very flavorful crisp and delicate. I liked the beet better than the carrot but we didn't waste a single morsel. My main course was the arugula salad and I had them add \"mushroom bacon\" and a fresh gingerale. Awesome flavorful and clean! No processed food here all made fresh and all plant based. I simply love the ginger ale. To finish things off we had turtle cake and lemon berry cheesecake made with cashews. The cheesecake , very light and down right delicious. The turtle cake Rich, smooth, and decadent. Who says eating healthy isn't fun.  I highly recommend trying something new and eating here.",

This must be like clown central as it only has 6 ingredients , and they left out guacamole, and the sunflower seed hummus. Basically, a veggie burger plus tomato and sprouts lol. We come from too far away to enjoy live food to deal with these continuous issues ...  Look for yourself!! The place was literally empty with other people to attend to also. No excuses ...just laziness!",

I ordered the Carmelized Onion & Pear Pizza.  It was pretty freakin' awesome.  The crust is created from flax seeds and buckwheat.  It's like a personal thin and crispy pizza, sliced into fourths and served like a flatbread.  My daughter ordered the meatless BLT and a side of  quinoa.  My wife ordered an Avocado Basil sandwich served on a multigrain bread and a side of Broccoli Waldorf.  All of the food was really good.     Our server, Leonardo, was very nice.  He represented the restaurant well.  He knew his menu and was able to make suggestions and answer questions.  He was nicely dressed and was very attentive to our needs.     The restaurant is really cool.  It is decor is somewhat industrial and somewhat distressed chic.  The large windows allow a lot of natural light in and creates a happy vibe.  The place is really clean.  They had a sanitation grade of 95 posted over the kitchen.  The restrooms were clean and smelled freshly serviced.  The kitchen is open so you can see \"behind the scenes\" and it looked clean and organized.       I enjoyed my experience here.  I can't wait to come back for breakfast sometime.  I hear their breakfast is really good.",

But that said, I really think that any food purchased and served at a restaurant needs to be delectable and satisfying. We had the fake sushi, the all veggie hummus (carrot and something else), and a burrito stuffed with a ton of veggies with some smashed beans wrapped in a raw collard green leaf.  I ate all of it but it was void of real taste and wholly unsatisfying.  I was hungrier after filling my stomach than before I started.  I think that without good taste or taste kick, it's just like eating a bunch of cellulose.  Maybe some of the other dishes are tastier or perhaps my taste buds have been ravaged by steroid and nitrate injected foods and need bigger blasts of flavor to keep the high...I wanted to love Living Kitchen but unfortunately I needed more tasty satisfaction.  I guess I'm not woke enough yet :-(.   I will go back again and give it another shot.",

We ordered the Living Bagel, Mint to be smoothie and Zinger juice. Loved all of them! Everything was light, fresh and healthy! You could taste all the ingredients in the smoothie and juice, both so refreshing! We also loved the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant, very warm and welcoming.

We had the \"tuna\" sandwich, BLT, Split Pea Soup, homemade coconut milk and Lemon berry \"cheesecake\".  The waitress/hostess was also especially nice and helpful in exploring the different menu options.   We had both sandwiches done with the collard green wraps and both sandwhich a were excellent. The BLT with the mushroom \"bacon\" was especially good. I do have a gripe though, there simply was enough filling in the sandwhich to be satisfying. While very tasty, you end up feeling a bit had (and hungry!). Also more filling would match the amount of collard green used as the exterior wrap.   The split pea soup with cashew cream was delicious. If nitpicking, some density or chunks of something were needed as it was a touch thin and watery but flavor was spot on and excellent.   The lemon berry cheesecake was the weak link. Certainly good enough but at $10 it was both too small and more of a tart palate cleanser than didn't deliciously decadent dessert. I'd suggest trying some of the others.   Lastly, the homemade coconut milk was excellent.  Creamy coconut flavor and just delicious.   4 stars only due to slightly skimpy portions for the prices asked. 5 star vegan food though. I WILL come back.",

I had the soup of the day which was chili and the two matched perfectly.  The chili had a nice hot spiciness to it.  For a drink I had the chocolate chaga which was like chocolate milk yet made with almond milk.  The service was really good once we had a server which took about 10 minutes.  Really my only gripe.  The restuarant is clean and nicely decorated.  Will definately come back here for a filling healthy meal.",

    "text": "It has taken me a long, long, long time to write this review. To be transparent, I went to Luna's in May, 2015. I try to write reviews that are fair, so it has honestly taken me time (see aforementioned timeline above) for me to unpack my thoughts about my experience.   I went with my sister whom was visiting from California. She's a vegan, so Luna's was to be a high point of her visit restaurant-wise to the Charlotte area. The ambiance of Luna's is great and our server was delightful. We popped in for a late breakfast after a Pilates class on a Saturday, but by the time we were seated, they had stopped serving breakfast by like 2 minutes. And no, ordering breakfast wasn't a choice at that point because I asked. I had actually really wanted breakfast too, so that started me off on a bad note. I ended up ordering the living bagel along with the purple rain juice. The juice was fantastic, and I can see why they are so popular.   The bagel looked beautiful in presentation, and was pretty darn tasty until I pulled a black wiry curly hair out of my mouth that was enmeshed in my bite of food. I have blonde hair, so it definitely wasn't my hair in my food. Further digging in the bagel revealed another strand of hair. I am guessing that \"living\" part of the name doesn't imply protein filament from the human head. That honestly turned me off so bad that I couldn't finish my meal. I didn't make a big deal of it at the time we were there, but that's because I didn't want to bother our nice server who was super busy.  I think it is definitely fair to say that I am not heading back to Luna's again.",

I've never experienced such a masterful artistry of fruits, vegetables and grains. People complaining that eating healthy tastes like shit obviously hasn't experienced this place. That's what it is. An experience. The ingredients are unusual, but delicious. Everything is a composition. Their menu is so unique and skillfully constructed. I could really give the chef a hug. No corners are cut here. There is real emotion in the food they make, real passion. It's obvious. Top five favorite in Charlotte, hands down.",

Unfortunately, Luna's living kitchen has not. After seeing the number of great reviews, we were quite excited to try a vegan, gf, option.  The food was not seasoned well. Less salt is fine but must be compensated with other spices. The price was outrageous given the cost of the ingredients without offering a side dish with the meal.  I am saddened by this experience as the money spent here could have gone to better use.  In addition to the food, the ac was cranked to frigid... so much for low carbon footprint.",

I had been craving raw vegan burritos after watching so many you tube videos and food bloggers making them. I enjoyed the \"living burrito\" with the salad as a side and the hot sauce was great! I loved the spice and trying to figure out how I can make it at home. The burrito was quite messy but that is expected as any food such as that is. My 7 year old daughter had the \"avocado basil sandwich\" in which I took a bite and it was tasty, she also enjoyed it. My boyfriend had the \"sprout it out salad\" and enjoyed it as well. What I loved the most was the \"caramel latte\" that I requested with coconut milk. Our waitress was a little slow bring things when asked which is my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.",

We shared 3 appetizers within 3 people and 3 different dishes to try it all. The dishes are not small, they will fill you up. My favorite is the Manicotti with the sliced zucchini, pasta, cashew ricotta cheese, and tomato- basil, etc for $13.00.   Man, just get a bit of everything and enjoy. My favorite smoothie is flying lucywhich is spinach, pineapple, banana, ginger, spirulina, lemonade so much to taste and enjoy.

When I approached the coffee bar, I noticed they didn't have a menu displayed, so I had t ask for a menu. I ordered a lavender cappuccino and a chai something or another. 2 coffee drinks for $14. Wow. I tasted my chai thing at the counter and it was awful, but what was I to do? I didn't know what to expect. I grabbed my lavender cappuccino and headed out.  My wife tasted the cappuccino and her face said it all. Then she said it \"this is awful, and I don't taste lavender at all.

I've previously had the sweet potato sushi roll, the Pad Thai, and the Avocado Basil Sandwich. I wasn't a huge fan of the sushi roll, but the Pad Thai was good and I loved the Avocado Basil Sandwich.   If you're a meat eater my advice is to go in with the right expectations. Don't expect something to taste like meat, but have an open mind and you'll realize that other things are good too.   I do feel like I never leave full. That's really my only issue with vegetarian food.   We sat out on the patio this time and it was nice. I think they could use some umbrellas to help with the sun in the summer.

    "text": "Had a great dinner at living kitchen last night.  Weather was perfect so took advantage of sitting on the patio.  Started with the cheese platter which was top notch, the fog jam is killer.  Then a kale Caesar, was very good but a Caesar is a Caesar.  Then the quesadilla, the tortilla is a ground sunflower seed which is banging, does have a little spice to it but was perfect for what I wanted.   Washed it all down with a couple glasses of funk zone. And a key lime pie for desert.  Pie was very good, a little too much raspberry topping but was very good.  Next time I am in Charlotte I will be visiting again.  A lot on the menu to try and can't wait to do so!  Hope you enjoy.",

My favourite part is their salads (Harvest and Kale Caesar Salads), Broccoli Salad, Avocado and Basil sandwich and Lemon-Berry cake. Also their Chia pudding is pretty good but extremely small, definitely not enough for breakfast. My least favourite was their Raw Bagel with Avocado and Turtle cake. The customer service is okay, nothing to write home about but good enough. Would be coming back for more.",

I chose the sweet potato sushi, pad Thai, turtle cake, and golden milk latte.  Sweet potato sushi: beautiful roll, great taste, filling (8/10)  Pad Thai: I liked it but didn't move it, it's mixed in almond butter but I couldn't taste it much. Wouldn't order again (6.5/10)  Turtle cake: AMAZING 10/10 great presentation, great taste. Loved the different layers and the taste was sweet but not overly so. Hit the spot.  Golden milk latte: great golden milk, foamy, great taste, nice amount of spices to it 8/10   GPS made this place a little harder to find. If you see anthropology it's right around the corner from it.   Overall, loved this restaurant and will come back.",

Everything on the menu sounds delicious but I chose the BLT and YES! Best BLT ever! I'm preggers so couldn't indulge too much, but the kale lemonade and ginger ale drinks were amaze balls! If I had more belly space and time I'd try everything on the menu.  I'm sure it'll all blow your mind. Definitely worth the trip and dining experience!  I'll be back! Thanks for all you do LK!",

We were in week 2 and were tired of eating brown rice and veggies so this was a perfect change of pace.  Kelsay got the chipotle quesadilla and I got the broccoli and mushroom pizza. The pizza is self explanatory, but the quesadilla was regrows beans, mushroom carnitas cashew mayo and sour cream and a few other ingredients. The pizza was okay, don't get me wrong the broccoli and mushroom combo was great, but it didn't really give me pizza \"vibes\"... but a great dish. Now the quesadilla... you COULDN'T tell me it was a plant based dish. I mean it tasted like a regular chicken quesadilla, we were blown away!   This is definitely a great change for those who are plant-based and those looking to try! Def recommend",

I came here wanting to have a healthy, vegan lunch.   Upon entering, the restaurant is bigger and prettier than I imagined. Lots of warehouse and hipster vibes. I decided to sit at the bar, in hopes of getting in and out quicker - that was a fail.   I ordered the broccoli mushroom pizza. It tasted okay. It took 30 minutes for me to get my meal. My server did not check on me once or tell me why my food was taking so long. I asked another waitress, she informed me supposedly the oven was super busy - but for some reason my dish was not even warm when it finally arrived. The food was cold. Though it tasted alright, it had NO tomatoes as described and I probably had two bits of a piece of mushroom on the whole thing .... at most. It was mostly the crust with broccoli on top. I tried the carrot/pineapple/ginger/lemon/turmeric juice and that was probably the highlight - the juice was tart and sweet. No complaints there.   I came in very excited for the food here. I am not sure if I caught them on an off day - but I wasn't blown away. The menu, location and overall concept are awesome and very needed in Charlotte, however I think there is a lot of room for improvement in the kitchen and service.",

I've been vegetarian for almost two years now but haven't really given Living Kitchen a real chance because of traffic and construction in the area.  It makes it very difficult to navigate, but I've made more of an effort recently and I'm not disappointed.  The smoothies they offer are beyond tasty and their breakfast options make me want to order one of everything on the menu.  The dining area is kept amazingly clean and the style is modern.  The staff are very helpful and attentive!!  Parking, when surrounding construction permits, is easy and available.  Several micro-environments in and out of the building to fit your mood.  I'm very impressed about the selection of vegan options they have that have all tested heavenly.  I will be coming back many, many more time.",

The restaurant itself has a clean, fresh vibe to it that makes me enjoy sitting there to really enjoy my meal. They've got a gorgeous Basquiat-style industrial-sized art print to decorate, definitely done by a local Charlotte artist who has building art in NoDa.  Most recently I grabbed lunch with a friend and ordered the Pad Thai bowl with zucchini and sweet potato noodles, bean sprouts, purple cabbage, red bell pepper, almond butter sauce, cilantro, cashews, and sambal, a delicious chili sauce reminiscent of Sriracha that adds a delicious spicy twist to the entree. I also grabbed an order of the \"Kale Paradise\" cold-pressed juice from the health bar that had a tasty combo of kale, pear, pineapple, cucumber, and fennel flavors. The only downside of Living Kitchen is that the juices are quite expensive for the amount you get, but well worth it to accompany your food perfectly.  Even for meat-lovers like me, Living Kitchen is a great spot to eat! I try to pop in whenever I'm home from school. Great staff and excellent service too!",

I've been too many times to count and while the service is hit or miss, the food is consistent. My goal is to try everything at least once. Yes, everything is cold. It's raw. There is something precious about local and organic food that connects us back to nature. If you're used to fast food, or heavily salted/sweetened things, this will take some getting used to. But for others who have a more down to earth palette will appreciate the love and care put into each dish and the amazing flavors from simple foods that I could never make for myself in my kitchen. The only con is that they're closed on Sunday.  Fav breakfast: Hola Granola with hemp milk Fav lunch: Caesar salad (those kale croutons oh my gosh) with a side of cranberry/walnut bread and nut butter. Fav dinner: Living burrito with local green salad. Fav dessert: Turtle cake (very small but it's very rich).  I hope Luna's is around for a very long time.",

They recently added a new mushroom pizza and a \"BLT\" made with mushrooms instead of bacon and it tastes exactly like I was eating a regular BLT!! I will definitely get them again but my usual go to is the fire & brimstone veggie burger which nothing can beat. Try their made in house hot sauce with it and for dessert, get the lemon-berry cheesecake!! Everything is a must try even if you aren't plant-based!",

The bananas are sweet and flavorful. The sliced citrus is juicy. He spread in the vegan bread mixed with the nuts give a tasty hearty bite! Plus drizzled with sweet honey/syrupy goodness! And the ingredients in the smoothie is so refreshing. This feels so much better than processed oatmeal or cream of wheat and scrambled eggs. I'm LVING his new lifestyle. One day at a time!",

The place is hip with ample room, the staff is friendly and well informed, and the food--albeit a little pricey--is stellar.  Fabulous, actually.     They stay True to their vegan roots with handcrafted offerings assembled with uber-fresh food.  Some may think serving vegan food is simply frying up a pile of tofu and saying, \"enjoy\"!  Not here.  Lots of outta the box thinking which proves (to me at least) that quality, wholesomeness, and value are intertwined.  And there is room for the menu to grow, too.  Yes, one can order a Big Mac value meal for half the price, but it may also get you to the morgue in half the time, too.  I heartily recommend Luna's as a solid restaurant in Charlotte's culinary scene.",

We ordered and shared the Biblical Breakfast which was their French toast and fruit. All of the different spreads and butters were amazing and so flavorful. The fresh fruit garnish of berries and bananas was also very delicious.   I also ordered a green smoothie and some juices to go.

    "text": "I've put off writing a negative review on this place for a long time, due to the fact that I really like the food. My biggest complaint for this place when it was Luna's, was that there was ALWAYS something missing from my order (i.e. salad dressing, avocado, the side item, etc.). Even under new ownership I was still having the same problem, so I would check my bag before leaving the parking lot. One time when I had to go back in the restaurant I said to the guy (very politely might I add), \"just to let you know this happens every time I come here,\" and his response was \"JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, everyone here is in training so...\" I couldn't believe that was his response. The latest thing, is that I ordered two things through Uber Eats and one of the items (living burrito) had a hair in it. I drove all the way there to have a new one made, and I explained that I ordered that along with the arugula harvest through Uber eats (cost me $34 with tip). You would think they would offer me a free dessert or something, but nope, nothing... not even a side. That's another thing that is absolutely ridiculous, their main dishes don't come with a side anymore, so you have to pay an extra $5 if you want one. And FYI- their prices on Uber eats are more than what they are on their regular menu (chia pudding is $7.50, but it's $9.00 on UE), which is also BS! Sadly, I think I have to be done with this place.",

But Luna's fits the bill perfectly.   I'm by no means a vegan, nor even a vegetation, but I do love vegetables and often find that restaurants focus too much on the \"comfort\" of meats and fried foods rather than veggies. That's where Luna's is different.   From the moment you enter, Luna's feels like you're entering a hip yoga studio rather than a restaurant.   I've only ever had take out, but the two \"entrees\" I tried were excellent. The rawco taco salad was big, spicy, and garlicky goodness, served with a side of delicious seams crispy things. Honestly I don't know what they were but I loved them.   I also tried the pad Thai. I've never had zucchini noodles before, but these were super. At first I thought they had used real noodles instead! The dish is a delectable combination of 'noodles', bell peppers, bean sprouts, and lots of other veggies, mixed together with an amazingly tasty spicy peanut sauce. I'm actually not a huge fan of pad Thai in general, but this vegan version is amazing!",

We got a sandwich and \"ceaser\" salad. The faux ceaser dressing was pretty good, very garlic-y though. Decent kale croutons. The sandwich was tasty (it was multi grain bread with a sunflower seed spread and avocado and sprouts and stuff.) Definitely more expensive for there to be no meat or real cheese, but then again I am not a vegan and I suspect they would appreciate a dedicated restaurant like Luna's. Big portions which I did not expect. I'd go back just for coffee ;)",

We knew going in that it was a vegan restaurant, but we somehow overlooked the fact that it is also mainly raw - which can be a hard combination for some people (most of the food is cold and doesn't contain wheat). I had the avocado, basil, and tomato sandwich (one of the few items containing wheat) with the Caesar salad, both of which were tasty and satisfying. My husband had the veggie burger and broccoli waldorf. Unfortunately, the burger didn't look like a burger at all since it was served on regular whole grain bread without any of the condiments that normally accompany a burger. It was really just a sandwich.The broccoli waldorf was just ok. The prices of most items were reasonable, but the drinks seemed to be priced very high. The \"fresh\" fruit juices (which we found out were not actually made fresh that day) are $10.   The service was very friendly. Overall, it was a good experience but there just weren't a lot of things that you can really sink your teeth into (which is the main reason we eat out) - it seems more like diet food.",

The smoothie and coffee bar are directly in front of you as you enter. The smoothie, Juice, and speciality drink menu looked fantastic with offerings such as the zinger (beet, Apple, orange, lemon), the Popeye punch (spinach, Apple juice, pineapple, banana, hemp protein), and the dirty chai (chai latte with a double shot of espresso), but for this visit, I wanted food! I asked my friendly waitress for her recommendations. She suggested one of the items that I had my eyes on: the Living Burrito, a combination of sunflower retried beans, cauliflower rice, guac, pico de gallo, onion, tomato, sprouts, and cashew cream. All of this goodness was wrapped in a collard leaf with the local green salad and a side of the house hot sauce. I placed my order, took a couple of pictures then BAM, my food was ready! No cooking involved so it was super quick! My food was delicious and flavorful. I felt satisfied after finishing the burrito but could not leave this place without trying the key lime pie. The pie was bright, refreshing, and the perfect end to my meal. I spoke at length with my waitress about the food, she answered all of my questions and seemed to have a great understanding and knowledge of the menu. Check this place out if you're looking for a quick and healthy meal.",

There is a nice patio with umbrella shade for days that aren't too hot. The inside has decent seating, but bring a sweater. It's always super cold!   Service: super friendly servers that are knowledgeable about the menu. If you come during peak hours, expect to wait just a little.   Menu: everything is plant-based, vegan, and raw. I often wish for them to add something (anything!!) warm to the menu!! Some days, I just don't want cold food! That being said...it's so delicious. My menu reviews: * Fire & Brimstone: get it in a collard leaf and ask for extra sambal sauce. Their Quinoa-millet burgers are savory and have a good texture.  * Living Burrito: one of my go-to menu items. Very filling. Great \"sour cream\" and spicy sambal sauce. Can be messy to eat and doesn't do well as a leftover...so eat it all!  * Rawco Taco Salad: Order this. Just trust me. I wish they gave you more than the 3 crackers on the side! Lots of avocado, walnut \"taco meat\", cashew sour cream, and crunchy lettuce.  * Vietnamese Pho: This wasn't bad, but I like real Pho too much to order this dish again. Kelp noodles and other ingredients are brought to your table then broth (yay for a slightly warm dish!!) is poured over the top at your table. The key to delicious pho is the broth and this just isn't Luna's wheelhouse.  * Sweet potato sushi: only menu item I just simply did not like.  * Falafel: a great appetizer! Yummy hummus served with pesto covered pitted olives, faux falafel balls, and pickled vegetables that were surprisingly amazing.  * Lemon raspberry cheesecake: No cheese, no cake, yet somehow this is a delicious cheesecake. It's a mystery. Or a miracle. But it's delicious.  * Favorite smoothie: Popeye Punch - green smoothie with great hemp protein (not too gritty) and a sweet-but-not-too-sweet taste * Favorite juice: Volcano- grab one out of the fridge and take it to go!  My friends have ordered the pad thai and lunasagna and have declared them yummy. I have not ordered either yet, but I trust their taste buds!   In summary, ignore the little voice in your head that tells you that spending money on raw food is insane and go give Luna a try. Chances are, you'll see me there!",

I also give a big thumbs up to the manicotti. its perfect. so much to choose from but i fall in the habit of repeatedly ordering the same few items because they are so good. I also enjoyed the rich tomato tartlet. The atmosphere is high ceiling open air ambiance. This is the type of place to go when you can share with others adn try lots of dishes. The portions are ample and they mostly use organic. I feel at home here and could make anything on the menu on command but its nice to be served and have someone else uncooking for me! :) By the time i have one of the fresh squeezed juices, a main dish and the cacao dessert(which i will get everytime)...the bill is already pretty high for one....but its worth it for the quality. plenty of parking....next to the train in charlotte Atherton Mill farmers market.",

Loose tea peppermint was great. I sat at the bar, traveling on business alone so it was perfect. Nice ambiance. I wanted dessert, they looked amazing, but I decided not to be a piggy.  Their juices looked really pricy, and too many of them have celery in them (which I loathe), so I decided to get two of their cooler items for breakfast later. I had the berry \"yogurt\" with the chocolate granola on top this morning. I usually will nto touch real yogurt with a 10' pole, but this stuff was GREAT. I can't wait to try the vanilla chia seed pudding with betty puree tomorrow morning. This place was great. I will be back!",

Easy to get to from uptown, Elizabeth and plaza and the other central to all things shopping and dining in South Park. Every time I go I try something different and I've had about everything on the menu. Today I had one of my all-time favorites the living bagel for breakfast with a warm golden milk (which is truly heaven sent). They sweeten the golden milk with dates and paired with Tumerick and spices it is truly amazing. We were there for a meeting and sat chatting so long that we also decided to have lunch so I got an appetizer, one of my favorites, the sushi sweet potato roll. If you're looking for healthy, nutritious options you can not go wrong at Lunas living kitchen. Smoothies, juices, snacks, meals, and appetizers in a clean and welcoming environment is all we need! We need more places like Lunas in Charlotte.",

All employees work with a smile and I have always had good experiences.",

Parking is super easy, there's a parking lot.  Everyone who works here is really super friendly too.  We actually came back twice that weekend because I loved it so much.  I was able to try the kale ceasar salad (SO SO SO GOOD!!!), the rawtaco salad (again SO SO SO GOOD), and of course the living burrito (again SO SO SO GOOD) - in case you didn't get the point.  I love how they are able to make things dairy free since I am lactose intolerant, the nut cheese are great.  I also love the \"kale croutons\" - it's all just so good.  I miss this place already.  The menu is so creative and it was hard to just pick a few things to try.  The only complaint I have was my juice was so cold that it had some frozen pieces in it... not a huge deal but just my only not so great moment.  Totally recommended and can't wait to come back!",

Yes the eventually turned it off, but to have air on in the  middle of winter is a bit much.   I ordered the special soup starter {sweet pea soup} it was really good and hot! I ate it so fast, just so it wouldn't become cold due to the air blowing directly on me. Then for my entree I ordered the Lunasagna that came with a a side salad. It was great tasting I just couldn't get past how cold it was and how cold I already was even with my jacket on {i.e. I had on a The North Face}.   I understand the concept and reason why they have cold food but a cold restaurant? I need a bit more of an explanation for that in the winter. Especially if the chefs are not using heat to cook there's no need to keep them comfortable if that were the case.",

I'm happy to report I was entirely wrong. The food is so good! I've been several times since my first visit and have tried a few different things. My favorite, by far, is the tomatico tart. I've tried almost all the juices they offer and have liked each of them as well. Sure it's all a little pricey but I think it's a fair price, given the product.   My only complaint is about the coffee: it is terrible, and this is coming from someone who can be content with a mug of JFG.   Otherwise, I like this place a lot and I'm glad I gave it a go!",

I'm happy to report, I was not disappointed! The spiraled veggies were flavorful and crunchy. The cilantro, lime and crushed peanuts pulled in all the flavors of traditional Pad Thai. And, the sauce everything was tossed in was delicious! Sweet, spicy, savory and tangy all at the same time. My only complaint is the price point at $15.00 seems a little high for this dish. I'm a fan though and will be back for sure when I can afford to splurge!",

Having spent time in Portland, this is as close as charlotte comes to the Portlandia, vegan, all natural/organic food trends.  I did not sit at a table; I opted for my salad to go. It was very busy around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon for lunch; always a good sign!  Things are pricey, but that is to be expected because they are using such fresh + local ingredients. There's so much I want to try upon coming back in. Unfortunately, since this is a vegan joint, many things are made with nuts which isn't ok for me because I'm allergic. But there are some nutless things on the menu.  I got the sprout it out salad (sans Brazil nut Parmesan) which was tasty. Avocados are nice and creamy, and the spiralized  root vegetables are a nice compliment (however it will only be one root vegetable; not a variety). I loved the hemp seed dressing; that was the real winner in my opinion. I love hemp seeds to begin with so creating a dressing with their extra protein is a huge plus. Overall, my salad was good (not out of this world amazing) but I definitely know what I want to order next time in!",

He felt so bad that I had been waiting and told me that he was going to take care of my bill. I did not let him do this because I didn't feel it necessary. The gesture was very nice.

I absolutely love how they always have different soups of the day. Recently I tried their rosemary cauliflower soup (it was so AMAZING that I even tried making it myself at home and it turned out almost the same... discovered the secret ingredient was APPLE)! I love their \"pasta\" entries mimicking lasagna and pad Thai. Never knew such flavors existed. Their desserts are superb too if you don't want to feel guilty eating a treat. You must also try their quinoa veggie burger. All in all, I love the atmosphere of this restaurant and never had any issues with their service. The staff is really friendly and the only thing I would change is maybe to tone down the loud music LOL (or change the playlist?), but again that doesn't impact the quality of the entrees or the service. If you've never had vegan food before, you definitely need to try Luna's. It's an experience you'll appreciate.",

I've also had the manicotti which was great. The TURTLE CAKE is small but SO GOOD. Overall great menu, great healthy tasty food. It's a little pricy for the portions but you're paying for the quality over quantity I guess.",

Loved my avocado basil sandwich - the hummus was so unique and the veggies were fresh. The side of cole slaw was a little watery so I'd probably opt for another side next time.  I also ordered the arugula harvest salad to go and brought it for lunch the next day (dressing on the side). This was super tasty - fresh, delicious dressing with a little sweetness, and fun ingredients.   This will be a go-to when I visit Charlotte next.",

    "text": "Lunch exceeded my expectations. This vegan restaurant specializes in organic, plant-based cuisine. I started with the sweet potato sushi rolls with Thai chili sauce. They were so cute I almost didn't want to eat them. I didn't want a salad so I tried the broccoli Waldorf. It had walnuts, raisins, celery, green apple, & red onion mixed with cashew mayo. It was similar to my dad's broccoli salad minus the bacon & he uses broccoli florets. The BBQ sliders with oyster mushrooms topped with cole slaw were so good. I've been wanting to try oyster mushrooms for awhile & they are a great meat substitute. They are a little different from regular mushrooms. For dessert, I had the turtle cake. Maaaaaannnnn, it's one of best vegan desserts I've had. I believe the crust was Medjool dates & pecans. The filing was coconut meat, more dates, cacao, & soaked cashews blended together to make yummy goodness. The caramel sauce was just blended dates if I remember correctly. I'm so full and happy.",

I would love to sit and eat here, even by myself, if I wasn't just picking up an order I had placed over the phone.  Note, they also take online orders through Postmates for delivery, or through their website for pickup only.  Not once did I feel guilty eating this food, not matter how indulgent or creamy it might have tasted.  They did end up forgetting to put the cake I ordered in the bag and I didn't notice til I got back to my hotel... but they refunded me after I called and I took it as a sign that I wasn't supposed to be eating sweets anyways, ha!  For a light appetizer, I had the \"Vietnamese Pho\" which really isn't anything near Vietnamese or authentic at all.  If you ignore that part, this is a nice, light, decently flavorful, spicy clear broth soup with loads of vegetables and a little bit of kelp noodles.  Great kick and good if you're craving some hot soup.  As my entree, I had the Living Burrito.  YUM.  I love that it's wrapped in collard greens which were incredibly fresh and had no sign of dirt or holes or anything.  It's got quite the mushy filling with the \"refried beans\", cauliflower rice, cashew sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole, but it's some of the best mush inside a collard green wrap I've ever had - not that there's anything to compare it to, haha.  It had plenty of flavor and I loooooved the house hot sauce it came with as well as the little green salad.  Luna's also serves a massive list of juices and smoothies.  I will definitely be eating here again, versus the same old boring salad joints.  It's not the cheapest thing in the world, but at least you feel clean eating it.",

The ingredients are fresh and filling. Their vegan cashew-basil cheese was great. I almost felt like I was eating regular cheese.   Price wise, most of the options at Luna's are reasonably priced for the quality and quantity that you get. Where this differs is for their coffees and deserts.

On my last visit I tried the Mushroom & Broccoli pizza. It was a smaller portion compared to the Living Burrito and Rawco salad but very filling and flavorful.

I decided to bring an out of town guest. Unfortunately, from the moment we walked in, we felt as if the staff did not want to be there. The hostess appeared to be very unhappy with her job. She was not welcoming at all. Not once did she smile or welcome us to the restaurant. It was 11:30am, and the restaurant was not busy. So it is difficult to understand why she interacted with us the way that she did. What is more, the server seemed to have the same attitude, snooty and dismissive. Considering we ordered $60 worth of food, I thought the server would have refilled our water. Not once did she ask how everything tasted. Nor, did she ask if we needed anything else. Although the food was good, I'm highly disappointed with my experience. I'm not quite sure if I will return. Tip for management: vegan does not have to equate to snooty. Typically, the staff is a reflection of those in the position of leadership. Perhaps, taking a more humble approach might help. ***SOUTH BLVD LOCATION",

Zucchini \"pasta\" with creamy cashew cream and a perfect tomato sauce on top. So good! My Omni date ordered the living burrito. He ate every last bite, and then finished my manicotti. We ordered the cheesecake for dessert and the golden milk. So yummy. We will definitely be back.",

I've seen all the other excellent reviews, so I may be the lone wolf who has been less than impressed with the service, particularly with those who work at the juice bar. I've had an issue with service almost every time I've visited. I'm usually ignored, spoken to in a condescending manner or quite abruptly.   As stated before, food is great, but because of the level of service that I have personally experienced, I limit my visits to once a quarter (always hoping that my next visit will result in incredible service with a smile).",

I came for my first time last week and when I found the site on google, it only started vegetarian options so I really wasn't sure if they had vegan options when I first came, so of course I double check and ask the waitress if there is any dairy used... she gives me a funky look (I mean I'm sorry that's it's my first time here and you've worked here a while) and says \"well vegan is a form of vegetarian,( which doesn't answer the question and isn't an accurate or friendly response )  so I just ordered, but I will ask to inform your servers there is a difference if any customer asks specifically for vegan. Thankfully they are completely vegan and I know this now, which I will continue to come here often, but for someone who may possibly come in with the same question, they should be given a less confusing answer. Perhaps \"we are plant based, so yes we meet vegan standards\"",

The raw pad thai wasn't as expected (raw noodle-style roots in place of noodle noodles) but it was still really fresh, zesty, and tasty. The Pho was absolutely delectable--cozy, nice accompaniments, and a surprisingly-sturdy-for-being-vegetable-based broth.   I also ordered the house chai latte with almond milk. The flavor was fun and the foam was high, but it was thinner than the syrupy lattes you might get from your local cafe so be prepared for the different-but-lovely experience.  I left full to the brim, but my boyfriend (who usually leaves the table just not-hungry anyway) did want a cheeseburger later in the evening, which didn't begrudge a bit since he came along with me to Luna's. :) I can't wait to try some of their other uncommon dishes.",

Such a creative and delicious menu. Followed my pad Thai (veggie 'noodles', fresh colorful veg, house made almond butter Pad Thai sauce and a spicy sambal sauce (ask for extra if you like spicy!). Followed up with a latte made with Larry's Beans and house pressed coconut milk. They served breakfast as well",
