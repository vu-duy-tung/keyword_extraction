    "text": "I've been coming to China Buffet for approximately 10 years now. When I first moved to Pineville in 2001 this was just somewhere close to eat cheaply. At that time they did not have the sushi chef.  The Chinese Buffet: Nothing to write home about. Nothing here is truly worth mentioning. Just your standard Chinese buffet fare mostly covered i thick, syroupy sauces and probably very unhealthy. Nothing is particularly good but nothing is particularly bad either.  The Sushi Buffet: This is why you want to come here (unless you're a sushi snob because no matter what you''re just not gonna be happy)! All you can eat sushi for around $10 (which also includes the Chinese buffet portion but let's pretend it doesn't for the heck of it). This is pretty unbeatable given that the sushi is freshly made throughout the day. Yes, I do agree that the presentation plates could be wiped off between servings on the fried pieces with heavy sauces but not all their offering has tick coatings of sauces. So, in my case, I don't eat those. I like them... but I chose to eat the ones that are not covered in thick sauces and look more presentable.  Tony, the sushi chef (I don't know the other guys'  name but thank god he's rarely if ever there) is really cool. He's very engaging with his customers, he remembers your name and your family. He greets you openly and warmly and is always ready to offer suggestions on new things to try. Remember to tip him well even if you don't touch the Chinese food (I usually don't, except for the egg drop soup)  The staff is very serviceable and are constantly refilling your glass and cleaning your table. They speak very little English but enough to understand what you want should you be the pesky customer who needs everything customized in a buffet style restaurant. Unfortunately, as someone else say, they do have the very rude tendency of always getting in the way and NEVER giving the customer the right of way. They cut in front of you and make you stop or go around them instead of them doing so for the customer. This is what knocked one star.  Obviously the staff has changed through the years. I remember a couple of waitresses throughout the years that were really nice and helpful. They got to know my little girls and tried teaching them how to eat with chop sticks. So, my, and Becky's, kids all love it here. This is definitely a good place to take children since they can pretty much try a bunch of things without worrying about not liking it (This is, after all, where my, at the time, 5 year old fell in love with Ikura). The owner, although in all the time I've been going has never once acknowledged that I am a regular (sometimes twice to three times a month) regular, seems rather unfriendly and, actually, kinda sour. I don't know if he is or not... but he doesn't seem very welcoming, warm or friendly. Not that it bothers me, I don't care, I'm there to eat... but I noticed it.  The decor is a mix of traditional chinese with some modern lighting and tacky foreign cluelessness (yes, I just made all that up but when you see it it'll make sense). And the place is very clean except for the ice cream machine which doesn't get enough TLC from the staff.  This is a great place to come and have lunch once in a while if you work in the area or have kids who want to try Chinese or have sushi lovers (not snobs) who want good sushi for free. But this is not the type of place that you will be making special trips to visit. Try to avoid dinner as it gets rather expensive without any appreciable additions to the buffet.",

I LOVE their food and its soooo cheap to buy thhing under $25.00 and you can REALLY pig out! Now if your a SENIOR they paid up front only $5.00 or less depend their age. If your near colleges they charger ONLY for the students $15.00!  Please NOTE: I been in only in CA not this location. There are outdoor seating with LIVE chinese band (they are pretty dang good) and some do cater too!",

The buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp, Mei Fun, and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!  Don't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california, cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross, makes my stomach turn to think about it.  Service was polite and good on the refills.  Enter at your own risk!",

    "text": "As I am not a sushi fan, I cannot attest to who is a good or bad employee when it comes to preparation.  My Dad dabbles a bit, and on one visit as he was at the sushi bar, he offered a tip to the preparer who then quickly pointed to which sushi he should get because it was \"the freshest.\"  Hmm...  I had lunch today because I had a coupon.  I always try never to be seated in the booths to the left of the buffet as you walk in as there is just too much employee foot traffic to negotiate.  Don't get me wrong, I like attentive service, but it was frustrating trying to get out of the booths and to the bar having to dodge the roving waitresses constantly up and down the aisle and, if not moving, firmly planting themselves in the aisle right where access from the buffet and booths are.  There was also little effort to move so customers could freely move about.  As far as the food, nothing exceptional stood out to me.  The \"house special\" chicken was alright once removing the skin which had a rubbery consistency.  The grilled shrimp were flavorless with no seasoning or grilled flavor making hot sauce or salt a necessity.  Other dishes were as expected with temperature being reasonable for a buffet.  What brings me back are their BBQ chicken wings which really should be labeled as hot wings for those not knowing they have some kick.  Not like wings you'd find at wing restaurants like BWW and a little small, but, hey, you can get as many as you want!  I ended my meal with some soft serve ice cream.  After circling the buffet a few times, I found my only options were to use a soup cup or have a cone as they had no dessert dishes.  Either they don't offer them or all were being washed.  The machine dispensed really fast, and all the cups were freshly washed (read this as still hot) so I luckily found a coffee saucer to put my cup under so I didn't drip all the way back to my seat.  Again, after nearly crawling over employees set up almost as obstacles to the customer, I had a few spoons of my now almost entirely melted serving in which I had little interest in trying to get another serving.  China Buffet is a little expensive for lunch even with a coupon.  I guess if I loved sushi this would be a great value.  I definitely will go again when I have a coupon but be firm in where I wish to be seated as the booths are just too big of a hassle when trying to get to the buffet and around the army of employees.",

There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way.",

The sushi here are way more quality then other places.  -I love their seafood stir fry dish with the shrimp and crab meat.  -love their jello!  -great service, they are always refilling your drink (sometime way sooner then you want them to)",

The Chinese food options are still the usual chicken in sauce or fried bits of meat in batter, there are a few choice that are perhaps a little less loaded in fat. I did get a couple of dumplings (grilled, not steamed) and a small pile of wontons.  The sushi display is fresh looking and in good condition. Tidy and with no loose bits scattered about as one might see in a lesser establishment. Some that aren't covered in sauce or fried, which was nice.  Service was good with empty dishes cleared and water refilled.  [Review 9949 overall, 1529 of 2018.]",

Four years later I am relieved to say it's improved.  The restaurant is busy so when we arrived after 7 pm it looked 'beat up' a bit. The floors were in desperate need of sweeping and the buffet was not as full of food as I had hoped. We managed to pick small amounts of what felt like were left overs.   The soup wasn't hot enough for me . The temperature was only semi warm. Definitely not hot.   The made to order sushi was the winner.  It was delicious.  Would I come back maybe in 3 years ....",

They had a pretty good variety of things, but mostly not asian.  They had a lot of random items like french fries, some kind of pizza, and a bizarre combination of seafood and cheese.    The price was low, and the wait time was nil. So, when i needed to eat a bite and get out to go to bed it wasn't bad. It is near several hotels, which is why it made sense for me when I ate there.   I would not recommend the mussels as they added some mayonnaise-based sauce which really tainted them for me. I like mussels, just steamed and with a little butter.",

    "text": "Buffets can be hit and miss and understandably not for everyone, but this place has been a family favorite for a number of years.  It has the standard fare of Chinese dishes as well as a friendly sushi chef on site prepared to make anything asked for.  The Manager (Tom) is generous and accommodating, and has always offered to make any special vegetarian items when requested.  A few particular favorites are the Broccoli and Tofu in Garlic Sauce, the Bean Curd Szechuan Style, and the Buddhist Delight.",

    "text": "As far as buffets go, this place is pretty great.  The buffet has all of the normal Chinese food that you would expect. It also has a sushi bar, a salad bar and a dessert section.   Lots of options for a finicky eater that might not like Chinese or for anyone trying to feed a small child.     Service was quick and the staff was very accommodating to our screaming one year old (yes, we got the joy of being THOSE people).   Definitely a restaurant that we will return to.",

It has been a few years since I had been there, prices went up and quality way down, and most probably my last time. Just not worth it.",

The chicken was very chewy like jerky, the rice was soggy, and to top it off it caused us all to get the runs. Save yourself- and your stomach- the trouble and go somewhere else to eat.",
