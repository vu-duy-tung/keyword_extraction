Service is always extremely slow whether I call in or place a to go order. This morning I placed my to go order at 9:32. It is 9:58 and I am just getting in my car. I inquired twice and was told it was coming up. I realize that most items are cooked to order but I just can't pretend that I'm not bothered when people who enter and order after me get their orders before me. I'm sure this will be my last trip!   I'm sure I can get a Greek Omelette, home fries, and bacon elsewhere. At least that's how Chuck's make me feel.",

The first time I went to this diner I ordered my food and sat down at one of the tables. The cook came out of the kitchen, grabbed one of the ketchup bottles, went back into the kitchen, put the ketchup on a burger, set the ketchup aside and continued cooking. He also touches raw meat an doesn't wash his hands.   I got my money back, walked out and never went back.   I gave it a 3 because the food is decent.

Price, portion size, wait staff and good coffee come to mind. While I commend Chuck's for having livermush on the menu I find the rest lacking.  Price is a little higher than many others given the portion size. One slice of livermush? The waitress gave the impression she really didn't want to be there and when I ordered coffee she looked at the pot and said they were out. It was 10:30 and they serve breakfast until 11:00. Hello?  Is it too much trouble to brew a pot of coffee for a paying customer?  The biscuit was quite unusual having the texture and appearance of a rollscuit. All in all breakfast was palatable but the experience was not pleasant. Too bad, I really like patronizing little \"hole in the wall\" places but probably not this one again.",

First their biscuits are homemade and they are great! The liver mush needs a more appetizing name for the weak hearted but it was very tasty. It tasted more like liver than liver pudding... YUMMY! The country ham was perfect and salty, just as it should be. The only complaint is that the food took over 30 minutes! It's a small place and it was full but not bursting at the seams. Shouldn't have taken that long but we were pleased!",

This is a small family run business with 5-6 booths that seat 3-4 and a few tables. The menu has a nice variety of traditional American breakfast and lunch, think roadside diner. The turkey sausage is tasty and I also tried shredded hash browns which I asked to be well done and they had just right crisp on them not almost burnt like some places. The kitchen is just opposite the seating and the cook greets you as you walk in. The lady who serves as waitress is polite and works quickly, the food doesn't come out super fast as everything is made to order. The inside is very bare bones so don't expect cuteness but they will have all you need. Prices are VERY reasonable. Get here early, they close by 1 pm",

    "text": "This 5 stars is every bit as much about the staff, vibe of the place, etc. as it is about the food, probably more so about the vibe, actually.  Chuck's is another in a line of long bookmarked but not yet visited joints that I finally got to for a meal.  The meal itself was a bacon cheeseburger and fries and it was solid and served quickly after ordering even during the lunch rush.  They also have a board of daily specials and you order it all going through the line.  I'm really looking forward to one of the specials on my next visit.  The vibe and staff though.... Wow and really the staff is the biggest part of the goodness that is Chuck's.  They are friendly and accommodating and kind and welcoming and every other word you can look up in a Thesaurus to match those words.    So what you say.  Isn't that what restaurants are supposed to do?  Absolutely, yes.  What really struck me at Chuck's though was this feeling that they were a microcosm of what America should be in that regard.  From what I experienced, Chuck's brings in a melting pot of people.  Black, White, Hispanic, white collar, blue collar, men, women, old, young, etc. and every single person got a genuine dose of that friendly, accommodating, kind and welcoming from the staff.  What I heard back from many of the customers was the same thing.  Lot's of so great to see you to the staff as folks walked in and thank you, see you again soon's, etc. as folks walked out.  It is clear that this place is all those lovely, welcoming things to all people every day they are open and that the diners respond accordingly.   Thanks for the role modeling Chuck's.  If a hole in the wall restaurant serving homemade, good eats can do it, so can the rest of us.",

Hash browns are frozen variety. My omelet came with cheese and instead of putting it on the inside of the cheese, all they did is put the sliced processed cheese on the bottom of my container and then put the omelet on top of it and let the heat melt the cheese. This is definitely not the business. My omelet was overcooked, lots of brown on it and it did have plenty of filling but I rather just drive a mile or so away and go to favorite spot.",

    "text": "Hole in Wall in Need of a few upgrades but a Good Value  My wife and I went to Chuck's for Brunch two weeks ago for Saturday Brunch. Calling it a Bruch is a misnomer since with the exception of burgers and a few fast food grill items, it's just a Breakfast menu.  We got there around 12 and they close at 1 pm so they were out of a couple of breakfast special items.  My wife is not a breakfast person so she order Salmon Patties and a side of fruit.  I ordered a ribeye, medium rare, eggs cooked well, hashbrowns and toast.  The reason for order the ribeye medium rare is because it's always overcooked and I was hoping for something around a medium.  Nope - well done again. To compensate, the eggs cooked well were runny. At least the hashbrowns and toast were excellent.  The room is one of those places where they try and shoe horn more people and tables than the room can comfortably accomodate.  Went to the rest room to wash my hands and had to walk a maze around people, tables and chairs to get there and event then, I had to ask some patrons to move just to get through.  The restrooms need a bit of an upgrade, at least in lighting.  There is one common sink for both the men's and women's  bathroom located outside the restrooms in between the entrance to the two.  As far as service, this was the high point.  Our server could not have been better. She was there when we needed her and not there when we did not not need her. Could not have been better.  Prices are very reasonable and for that reason, it's a good value.  Before we left,we looked at the full menu and specials for the rest of the week. Much more expansive with a lot of other options on the menu, particulary of what we call comfort food. Maybe Saturday Brunch is too limited.  My wife did make the comment that we should try it some other time during the week to explore those other options.",

The food was great for the price but I waited at least 40mins for my food. It is one chef so next time will call in advance. Customer service was fair but the unexpected long wait overshadowed everything.",
