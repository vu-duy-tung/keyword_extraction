The only reason I did not say four stars is because their hostesses are young,  inexperienced and unhelpful. They are the first people you encounter and I have never had a positive experience. Once one told me \"good luck\" at finding a place at the bar during a game day. I understand, but maybe try a little finesse? The food helps me overlook the irritation caused by their hostess staff.",

We got the supreme pizza and while it was loaded with veggies, it didn't have anything that would make me want to come back. The pizza was kinda bland and could use something else. Maybe it's the sauce? For $23, it wasn't near the pizza I was hoping for. I really wanted to forego a pizza chain and do local but this isn't the place I'll go back. Maybe I'll try other menu items. I guess I now know why it seemed kinda empty on a Saturday night.",

The waiter passed my table several times without even asking if we enjoyed the food. My glass was only filled once which was the time they actually brought the glass to the table. We were well finished with our food and still hadn't been asked if we were ready for our check. I ended up having to ask for the check. Although the food was great, I will probably never visit this establishment again because of the service.",

I enjoyed being there at an off-time. While it wasn't crowded, it wasn't empty at all, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and having a good time. I also especially appreciated how nice the servers were consider I had an overly rambunctious toddler in tow. Great place.",

And what do you know, after 12 years with this man he finally found a pizza place that tastes like home. We ended up making our own pizza and it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. It started with the original crust, added a chipotle sauce as our base some mozzarella, pepperoni, onions, minced garlic and get this... Chorizo!!! Chorizo on pizza?! I'm in love. I also loved the fact that I could order a flight of craft beer. Which was an excellent way to sample at least five brews and all with a decent amount in each glass. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I am a pizza fanatic.  I am not too particular about the crust or the flavors of the pizza, I just want my pizza topped with an odd combination: pineapple and a nut (walnuts, almonds, pecans).    I ran into Pizza Peel late last night and asked for a pineapple and walnut pizza to go with ranch on the side.  The bartender advised it would be about 10min - perfect!  She rang me up and I paid with credit.card.  She brought me the pizza and I informed her there wasn't the side of ranch.  She said she was sorry and would get it.  She rang me up for a side of ranch for 54 cents.  And I waited for her to take my credit card, once again, and bring me the side of ranch.  I waited, and waited, and waited.  All while watching her maintain a conversation wtih a group at the bar, eat ice-cream out of their bowl and overlook other customers needs, as well as my own.  It took 5 min for the ranch to come out.  The manager brought it and said that I would not need to be charged the 54 cents.  I thanked him and went home.  I got home to discover that the pizza was extremely spicey.  I called back and asked what they had put on the pizza, and the same bartender said she thinks they may have put chipotle sauce on instead of regular.  She said she would have them make a new one now.  I ran back up the street and the manager provided a $10 credit for my next purchase.  When I got back home with my pizza it was missing the walnuts.    I think this is a great location for a pizza place, a cool indoor and outdoor environment, and great beer-on-tap selection; however, I do not think the bartender had any intention of providing service to anyone other than her friends at the bar.  It is unsanitary and discomforting to see wait-staff eating out of a customer's dish and then handle your food.  She was rude, inconsiderate of the customer's needs, and lacked any attention to detail.",

They have a nice but not overwhelming selection of craft beer, including many local brews, and great pizza options! I can vouch for the Sorry for Partying (though it's too much meat for me so we usually get it without the pepperoni and ground beef), Roasted Veggie, Black Bean, Greek, Tong's Thai, and Aguascalientes (perhaps my favorite)! [Told you we've been several times.] Garlic knots are tasty if you're starving!  They also do a great job with the salads - they're huge and great for splitting before the pizza comes! If you're splitting one, they'll often go ahead and put it in two bowls for you - I'm convinced it turns out even bigger that way. Great way to fill up so you don't eat all the pizza and can come home with leftovers!  It's crowded on Friday evenings, but with a party of two you don't usually have to wait very long. The bar is also crowded, though, so can take a minute to get a beer while you wait for your food. Staff is easy-going and friendly. Might be better for groups on a weeknight.",

I met my friend for dinner on a Friday night a couple weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait. I arrived around 6:45 p.m. and was immediately seated at the table where my friend had already been waiting. Although for some reason, children seemed to be the overwhelming demographic that night so the place was L-O-U-D.  We both ordered the pumpkin beers on tap (highly recommend!) and I ordered the Thai's Tong pizza. This is not the place to expect 'typical' pizza offerings but the pizzas are perfectly sized for individual consumption (cuz I'm greedy but if you're not, they're good for sharing too). The thai's tong pizza was delicious, not too much heat and not too much sweetness. A nice blend of the two flavors. I always judge a pizza by its crust and I'm happy to report the crust is on the thinner side and lightly crispy.  Pizza Peel is located directly across the street from Zada Jane's and my only gripe about the place is that the parking lot is quite small so you'll have to rely on street parking or the lot across the street (if it's not peak hours).",

After calling around and doing my best negotiation attempts, I ended up taking my car to a little shop in Plaza Midwood who did a decent job. Fast forward a few years and that old car is gone (and not missed!) and that same garage is transformed into a hip pizza joint. I think it's a neat story that seems to be as good of an analogy as any to the rapid growth and transformation of the city. Anyways, the Pizza Peel definitely has a vibe all it's own and is a neat place to hang out in a very competitive foodie part of town. I would splurge to get one of the specialty pies as they seem to put a bit more into them. Also I appreciate the wide selection of local drafts to compliment your pizza. As for entertainment, they take full advantage of the green space out front where I have seen everything from Yoga classes to large drum circles. Stay funky Plaza Midwood!",

The Average: o  Typical pizza joint menu, but on the upside they had quite a few toppings available.  The Meh: -  Mediocre (at best) crust.  Doughy and lacking flavor.  No offense, but it reminded me of something you'd get at a grocery store. -  The Toppings.  While the topping list was extensive, I was simply not blown away by the flavor.

    "text": "Went for the Monday night FREE yoga. Pro tip: arrive early because it will be packed and you don't want to be *that* person who makes everyone shift their mat. So much fun to be doing yoga in the middle of bustling Plaza Midwood while overhearing a debate about Smart TVs over pizza beside you. Plus you get 10% off your bill if you do the yoga and they have $3 local pints on Mondays! To all of the people who left after smelling pizza for an hour, how? how did you do it? I need willpower like that.   Snagged a table inside with some friends. Nice decor. Service was a little slow, but I think our server was new. No big deal as we were in no hurry. I had the positive friction and oh man it was delicious. I thought $8.95 for an 8\" pizza was pretty reasonable too. A lot of their other menu items looked good too, but I felt obligated to go with a pizza my first time there. Defintely want to try the marinated feta, tacos and the fiesta salad. Guess I'll be doing some more yoga in the near future.",

Nice atmosphere inside. We sat down and ordered 2 beers--Shotgun Betty for me and NODA Imperial Gordgeous for my husband.....I didn't even see the Imperial Gordgeous on the menu, so of course, I had to get a second beer to get it. So amazingly delicious and smooth. Man I love that beer. Makes me want Fall to be here! Anyways, I digress. There beer list is very good. Lots of local craft options. Also, I thought it was neat that they had a section suggesting beers, if you didn't know what to order!  We ordered the garlic knots as an appetizer becaues we were so hungry. Honestly, we could have definitely done without these. They were just ok and not as garlicly as we were hoping.   For the pizza, we ordered the supreme pizza (i have no clue what they called it but basically had a few types of meats and a few types of veggies). There are only 2 sizes, basically an indiviudal pizza and a large pizza. We ordred the large and, of course, took home leftovers. The pizza was very good. I felt like everything was just incredibly fresh!  Definitely will be returning because of the atmosphere, beer, and pizza!",

Nice mood lighting, good reggae music playing tonight, comfortable seating, and lots of Windows  They have a pretty long beer list, and offer various flights based in your taste, our you can create a custom flight for $8. The flights come with 4 mini glasses  We ordered two 8inch pizzas, the dyk with pesto and the veggie with red sauce  The pizzas came with whole wheat crust to our delighted surprise, and were two of the best pizzas we've ever had  Also got the sweet po fries. Delicious.  Service was friendly and pro   Good job Andrea  Thank you for a great dinner ^.^",

Sweet and tangy with a little kick at the end from the rum. The beer selection is not out of this world, but what they have serve a great purpose. Your small sampling of Bud/Coors/Miller and then a great assortment of local and national craft brews. I settled on the Asheville Brewing Co. Shiva IPA. Definitely a strong choice.   Coming to the pizza, the fiance settled on one of the limited specials, the \"Kimbo Slice\", which had the defining feature of Granny Smith Apple slices. Same as the drink, a nice little twang to it. I chose the pizza that best fit my lifestyle, the Sorry For Partying Supreme. Three different meats, three different peppers, definitely one of the best pizzas I have had this year.   Service was run-of-the-mill, no complaints. Atmosphere was a little loud, but it's a pizza joint/bar, again no complaints. Will definitely be returning and would definitely recommend if you're looking for some \"designer pizza\".",

Confession: I use to order $40 worth of food so Foodie Call would deliver to me. So, yeah I've been pumped and counting the days for this new location to open.  My hands down favorite pizza here: Thai's Tong. Chicken, Thai sweet chili sauce, basil, onions, red pepper. The sauce just makes this pizza pop. Yum. In 92 pt font. First runner up: the buffalo chicken. Nachos are great. Bruschetta is addicting. Once I start eating it... I can't seem to stop.  The inside looks amazing. Walls are wood. They brought in an old piano from The Common Market in South End. Peel plans to bring in someone who can play it. What else can you expect? Music trivia nights, a ton of great beer. All of the beer. The GM knows more about beer than any other person I know.   One thing though bums me out: the location does not have my favorite menu item. Sad face. I love the curry rolls at the Cotswold location. I dream about them sometimes. They take awhile to make, so currently they can't handle both locations. My fingers are crossed that this somehow changes in the future.  Congratulations on Peel #2. This city is a better place with not one, but two of you.",

    "text": "The 2nd and newest Pizza Peel location on Central Ave is much more open (not as claustrophobic) than the original one in Cotswold.  There's also plenty of outdoor seating, whereas the Cotswold outdoor seating area is screened in and just plain awful.  The tables at Central are \"community tables,\" though, of which I'm not a big fan.    We haven't had any problems being seated at this Pizza Peel, even on busy nights, either inside or outside, depending on our preference.  In fact, we've gone to Pizza Peel as an alternative (and were seated right away) when the wait for Peculiar Rabbit went from 30 minutes to over an hour with no explanation.    Pizza Peel offers unique pizza topping options, not your standard cheese and pepperoni (although they do have that).  My favorite is probably the Buffalo Chicken, but I have enjoyed Thong's Thai, Greek, and Positive Friction as well (the latter two being vegetarian options).  And the 8-inch pizza under $10 is just the right size and price.  I'm so thankful, as I don't have to have a group consensus on what type of pizza to share.  I can order whatever I want.    We've also tried the Garlic Knots appetizer to hold us over until the pizzas came.  They're big and yummy, too, and great for sharing with a group.  I have yet to try anything other than the pizza at Pizza Peel, although many times the sandwiches, salads, and pasta sound extremely appetizing as well.    The service has always great, even though the parking for the Central Ave location can be tricky (and very limited).  Be prepared to park on one of the side streets and walk.",

The toppings were delicious but much too sparse. I had a veggie (caramelized garlic, goat cheese and artichokes) pizza and added caramelized onions, sundried tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles.  The flavor was excellent but only 1 sundried tomato on the whole pizza and just a few onions.   What made this a 3 start experience was the lack of service during the second half of the meal. Our server was great until the food was delivered but then she disappeared. We waited for 20 minutes with a very antsy baby for the check before taking our credit card to the bar to pay.   I might try this place again, but to indulge in pizza calories, it really has to be a stand out experience.",

Cool looking spot, great location with lots going on around it, nice vibe, great taps of beer flowing.  But I came here for the pizza.  And sadly, it left me very unimpressed. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  It was decidedly \"meh\".  Completely, totally, \"meh\".  I have no reason to ever come back. I could see grabbing a draft given the nice selection, but if I'm going to eat unhealthily, it had better taste pretty damn good.  And sorry, but this isn't it.    The search continues...",

We have been here twice now and the full experience (i.e. wait time & customer service) has turned us away from this place. We live in PM, and there are too many other places nearby (from MP and Noda) to get good pizza from and have a better experience.   Our first visit was when this place opened. There was a mix-up with what we ordered and what we received - something to do with Prosciutto, and Bruschetta. But the manager made it right by throwing in the other half of the pie. It just took a really long time (about an hour) to get what we ordered.  The next time was about a month ago. Got a small pizza to go. Took a little over an hour to get the pizza. Most of the other people at our table had gotten their orders and were paying their bills as we waited for our to go order. The service was lousy as well and we finally had to get up and talk to a manager. The manager went to the food window and got our order - seems it had been there for a bit (back to the lousy service). All he offered was - \"we're busy.\" No apology or offer to smooth it over.",

I just recently decided to transition to a cruel free diet..which pretty much limits my options to nothing..unfortunately they do not offer the option of cruelty free, or sometimes called certified humane, cheese (which I would totally pay more for). However, they do offer a vegan cheese. SCORE! I finally found a place I can eat at without alienating my friends, or selling a kidney. The service is wonderful! We were greeted immediately upon entry, and it never felt fake or forced. Our waiter was attentive, without being obnoxious. The manager checked on us, which was really nice. I will surely be back.

Instead, I have a 25$ pie with a slice taken out, currently holding my dining room table to the floor.   This pizza that is among THE worst tasting pizzas I have ever had. The crust was very dense, and overwhelmingly dry and wheaty. The toppings were too salty, too acidic, and just plain flavorless. Additionally there were fairly minimal as well.  I literally finished a slice. One. Of my $25 pizza.   This place is a hard pass",

Anyone can guess like that! Overall, great time. Pizza was on par!",

    "text": "I've driven past this place so many times and have been wanting to stop in to see what was so good to have a full house every single time! Finally stopped in on Saturday and unfortunately, wasn't able to figure out the hype. The pizza was great, I mean really good especially for the price point, but the service was atrocious.   The hostess didn't really ask us if we wanted to sit inside or out, and sat us right in front of the door in a mostly empty dining room. Awkward placement to say the least. It was unclear from there which staff member was going to be waiting on us. Our waitress finally came around and asked what we wanted to drink, but the poor girl was serving tables inside and outside. There seemed to be no rhyme or rhythm to the service in this place. The table next to us had a different waiter who was also running between inside and outside. Consequently we barely saw our waitress and when we did we had to waive her down to get help.   Advice to management- reconsider your table assignment structures/systems. It doesn't make sense to have a staff member serving two tables inside and two outside because inevitably the service for all four tables suffers as you can't be in two places at once. I don't really fault our waitress for the bad experience this weekend, because I am sure she had tables everywhere because of management.   Will definitely give them a second chance, but I hope they have the service bit figured out by then.",

    "text": "I've heard pretty mixed thing about Pizza Peel but after dining here twice I think it's a very solid pizza option, especially considering the pizza landscape of Charlotte (relatively dim in my opinion).  Everyone who works there is very nice and friendly. They generally pull a decent crowd but there's always an open spot. They have a great beer selection. The atmosphere is very casual - there are some TVs and lots of outdoor seating plus their turf area where kids play or adults do yoga or play games.   They have a good amount of vegetarian options - in fact, the pizza menu is divided by veggie or not. As far as I know they do not carry vegan cheese but if you got a pizza without cheese it should be vegan. I've had the roasted veggie and the positive friction. Roasted veggie was standard and the positive friction was AWESOME. Their pesto is a great flavor. I just wish they used fresh tomato slices instead of tiny cubes. The 8-inch is the perfect size to leave you satisfied but not crazy full. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday afternoon at noon because we heard it was very kid friendly which may have been the case if we didn't wait for 30 minutes for our food. The excuse was \"sorry we had like, 6 tables come in at the same time\". On a Saturday at noon?!? Couldn't have seen that one coming. So it loses a star solely for service.   That said, I know I could go tomorrow and get great service probably so without dwelling too much on that aspect, the food was fine. The pizza itself is like slightly less good mellow mushroom. Ours clearly sat under the lamp for a while so may have been better fresh, but nothing to write home about. The wings were very good - large and well fried. Salad was flavorless.   Honestly if I lived down the street, I would probably take the family here once a month. But living even 15 minutes away, it's unlikely I'll be back.",

Pairing a pizza with a salad is the way to go for me.  The Peel Salad is really delicious, and the dressing is light but adds a nice zing to it.  Their individual pizza crust is crispy.  You know a pizza place has their stuff together when the center of the pizza isn't soggy.  The people next to me got some wings that looked really good, too.  Beer and wine selection was great and just what you would expect from a local pizza place.  I did a make-your-own the first time...I can't complain, it was good and just the way I wanted it.  The real winner was the Sorry for Partying Supreme.  I'm Sorry for Trying this Pizza, because now I'm going to be coming back and ordering it more often.  Thanks, Pizza Peel.  You're comfort food is so good that I might have to go get a gym membership and actually use it.",

My boyfriend ordered the Mediterranean with shrimp and proceeded to pull a ball of paper out of his mouth. Our serve did not check on us once to see how we were and we sat with empty drink cups.

    "text": "My hubby discovered this little gem and since he and my son are pizza freaks we decided to give this place a try.  It's nice and clean and very appealing, it seems, to the residents in the neighborhood. Lots of families and tables filled with people drinking, laughing and eating together while the children played in the open \"grass\" area with balls and Frisbees. I suppose if you wanted to go to a quiet dinner, sitting outside is probably not your best option. It was much quieter inside but we sat outdoors, I have wee ones.  The waitress was very attentive and answered my questions and when she wasn't sure of something, she went inside and asked. Loved this because some just say, \"I'm not sure.\" and then stand there and look at you.  We ordered a 16' red sauce and cheese pizza, and 8' heart attack pizza, a philly cheesesteak and 8 wings (4 buffalo and 4 inferno).  Cheese Pizza:  Thin Crust, nice chew and a little crisp. Son and daughter liked it.  Heart Attack Pizza:  Meats were flavorful, hubby devoured it, I gave it a taste and it was good but not mind blowing. Needs a tad more seasoning but definitely not disappointing.  Wings:  Oh, the wings!  I was literally humming and doing the happy dance.  They were crispy and spicy and soooo yummy!  I loved them. They were also the a nice size, not those tiny little wings. These were meaty and filling and worth the $1.00+/piece.  Couldn't tell the difference by sight between the buffalo and inferno (made with habanero) but after tasting them you could tell one had more heat. Hubby took one bite and couldn't handle them.  I have a high heat tolerance!  Cheesesteak sandwich with homemade chips and dipping sauce:  Very nice.  My daughter had provolone, lettuce, tomato and raw onion which they put on the side.  The waitress seemed perplexed that she would want raw onions. LOL! Guess that's not a thing here. I had a couple of bites and it was very good. Lots of meat and a good portion.  I was surprised they didn't serve fries but the homemade chips were really delicious and I love the ranch dipping sauce. My daughter had to keep smacking my hand away.  I took away one star because my daughter had to ask two different people for ketchup and her food got a little cold while she waited. And the fact that they don't serve French fries, just sweet potato fries.  Their chips are yummy though.    I will definitely be back and will try new things but I will certainly get the wings and some of those yummy, seasoned, homemade chips!!  Hope this was helpful! Now, go and eat!  That is all.",

Also if they are not very busy your pizza choices will be limited. The price is the best thing about the buffet but it was not worth it for me even at $8.99! You can ask them to make something but they may or may not do it.  Enough about the buffet! I have to say this is not the best pizza in town and is a bit crusty for me but not bad if you are looking for a quick meal with friends. They do have other stuff including a few decent salads. I do think this is a good place for a group and I enjoy their outdoor seating area.",

The Pizza Peel uses top quality ingredients and that's just the start! Honestly, pizza should be its own food group! The staff here is friendly and attentive to everyone.This place is both family and dog-friendly. Dogs are allowed outside. Not sure about the inside. There are several events hosted each month. Everything from Music Bingo to a Crawfish Boil (which I attended). This business is very active in the community.   The menu offers a variety of options all reasonably priced.   My husband and I love the El Blanco Pizza! Come with a three cheese sauce, mozzarella cheese, sliced tomato, and fresh basil. We add extra cheese and sausage. SO DELISH!!!  I look forward to coming here more often, I love the food and atmosphere. Also, the events are fun!",

Chicken was super dry and there was barely any sauce on the pizza. There were about two small cubes of chicken per giant slice of pizza. Would rather have had dominos than what we got tonight.",

For starters, they are in a great location in Plaza Midwood.  The interior is spacious, with several TVs for sports fans.  They also have long picnic tables for seating outside.    We always start with their amazing curry chicken rolls that are deliciously crispy and a little bit spicy.  For our entrees, my husband likes the Heart Stopper Pizza, with ham, sausage, pepperoni, beef, and bacon.  I like making my own, with a pesto base, artichokes, and basil or arugula.    Their crust is a wheat/white crust, veering a little more on the wheat end.  I've never tried wheat crust before, and theirs is absolutely delicious.  It's thin, crispy, a teeny bit sweet, and the bottom stays dry.  It s hard to describe the taste, but it's uniquely different in a good way.  We'll keep returning!",

We came in on a Saturday night about 1130 pm and waited five minutes to be seated. Mistake number 1 they weren't even that busy. We get seated and waited another 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order. The lady came and got our order and instead of bringing us our drinks she tended to other tables which made us wait another 20 minutes for drinks we finally get our drinks. So we put in our pizza order after being in the restaurant for 45 minutes. We then waited another 30 minutes for our food which still wasn't ready so my date and I decided to walkout because this was totally unacceptable. I will never and I repeat never visit this establishment again. Which sucks because I really liked this place.",

It includes spicy chili sauce, tomatillos, chorizo, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, red onions, roasted corn and black bean salsa, and there was little of any of these except for the cheese. Not much chorizo or the corn and black bean salsa so the flavors didn't come out as I hoped. The thin crust is fine but toppings should compensate.  Seating outdoors is always fun and of course lots of people-watching available on this corner lot.",

    "text": "TL; DR version- pretty good pizza, lots of beers, slow service.  Stopped in recently on the recommendation from a buddy without reading the reviews first (wait, what!). The restaurant itself was smaller than I expected, but they do pack the tables in. I was told there was outdoor dining, but I missed this? It was too hot for outdoor dining in June anyway!   We stopped in around 9pm or so on a Friday night. Most people were situated at the bar at that point; there were maybe 4 tables seated throughout the place. Our waitress stopped by really quickly to get us menus and take our drink orders. As there were pages of beers, which is awesome, and I had never been here before, I wanted a second to choose something. This was my first mistake. We did not see her again for probably about 10 minutes. Well, that's not True- I saw her around the restaurant (chatting by the bar, checking her phone, etc), but couldn't get her attention. We weren't in a hurry and were just hanging out, but I did really want to get a drink...  Finally got her attention and got our drink and food orders in. We each ordered a small pizza- I got the El Blanco, he got the Updyke. Then we waited. We each finished a beer, ordered another, and got the second round of beers with no pizza in sight. Almost a half hour after ordering our food, our waitress stopped by to let us know that they had to remake one of our pizzas... okay... but 30 minutes and then they needed to remake one? Apparently it was the El Blanco that needed to be remade, as mine arrived piping hot and the Updyke arrived lukewarm/semi cold.   Now, the food is good. I'm a pizza snob for sure, and I thought it was yummy. Was it NY/NJ pizza good? No. But the crust was a good mix of crunchy on the outside and doughy on the inside, and the toppings were fresh and cooked well. Would we have been happier if we could have eaten our food 15 minutes earlier? Yes.   Seems like they have a bunch of good deals running throughout the week, which is always a plus.",

I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza. I was honestly super disappointed. There was barely any sauce or chicken on the pizza. The only positives about my experience here was the cheese on the pizza (which is a stretch) and how friendly our waiter was. I more than likely will not return. Maybe it was a bad night?",

Its a nice atmosphere you can either dine in or outside. On Saturday they usually have $5 margaritas which are really good. This particular time we tried the eggrolls which were sooooooo good. The waitress and waiters are really informative while catering to your needs. The pizza that we always get is \"the heart stopper\" which is basically like a meat lovers pizza with Red sauce, mozzarella, ham, sausage, beef, pepperoni, bacon. Absolutely delicious and I truly recommend if you want to indulge in meat that day. I gave it 5 stars because I have no complaints from the many times I've visited the establishment. If your ever in the Plaza/Midwood area and have a taste for pizza, definitely give this place a try.",

They have live music some nights, and when it's inside it can get pretty hard to hear or hold a conversation. Their outdoor space is nice and great for families with kids because there's space for them to run around. Overall I wasn't very impressed with the pizza.",

I really like the build your own pizza options and the portions are very nice. My boyfriend and I can usually split a small pizza and get two slices a piece if we're not starving. Highly recommend the spicy tomato sauce if you like some heat. The beer selection at this place is also really nice because they have lots of local beer and also offer flights so you can sample several. Definitely one of our go to spots on Central!",

The menu is your typical pizza place but also has a ton of sandwiches and a few entrees.  We had pizza (the supreme) and also got the buffalo chicken pizza.  I also had a side salad which had DELICIOUS balsamic dressing!  I would maybe go back for that alone!  The pizza was good but didn't knock my socks off.  The crust is definitely unique to there- it almost reminds me of wheat crust.  I also tried one of my friends wings (bbq) which usually aren't my think (I like buffalo only usually!) but these were pretty good and large in this flavor.  Service was good and the kids liked to run in the outdoor area.  Just not an ideal place for a large group- you couldn't interact with everyone because there just wasn't a good place to put us.  My only gripe!  Not sure I have to go back, but I'm glad we tried it!",

Meredith, you DID THAT. I got the quinoa and lentil bow, my friend got the BBQ chicken Pizza. We ordered the Fried pickles as an appetizer, and Y'ALL, when I say these were some of the BEST fried pickles I've ever have, THESE WERE THE SOME OF THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. They tasted like they meant it when they cooked it! I had the Lentil and Quinoa bowl (omg, AMAZING (fulfilling, vegan/vegetarian friendly), it was AMAZING and hit the spot. They have a great beer selection, and food menu. Def check this place out if you're in the Charlotte area. Also, shoutout the the GM Meredit Lances who made our trip to the Pizza Peel an unforgettable experience!!",

It was great and I love that l can help our rising students succeed this year.  The bartender was my server since it was midday. He was so nice and very engaging with the customers. When he brought out my pizza he noticed t was a little burnt in too. He asked if I was ok with it like that and I said yes it was fine. I was glad he addressed it with me first and not just assume that I was ok with it.   Then as I began to lift up my pizza and goo my first bite that's when I noticed how extremely burnt it was. I took it over to him at the bar and said, \" ok I think I'll take you up on the offer of changing it\". We laughed and he said, \" I knew you would I noticed it was over cooked\". I didn't realize it was so burnt in the bottom as well. But I appreciated him noticing, taking action and correcting it immediately.  I received my new pizza and all was well! I shared in my photos the before and after pictures .",

We ordered 2 pizzas 8 inch, they charge about a dollar for every single topping you add to your pizza. They even charge 55 cents for BBQ sauce, what the crap! Most pizza places offer a few sauces and such at no charge. Also if you are going to charge then you better put a good amount of each topping on my pizza, ESPECIALLY when I note please put lots of goat cheese.   I am attaching a photo of my pizza from Pizza Peel that I got tonight (on right, round pizza) and next to it is a competitor (zablongs, flatbread style) here is what I see:   Pizza Peel $12 for a pizza with hardly any toppings, 4 slices. Mostly bread and crust. I had 5 pieces of prosciutto, 5 clumps of goat cheese, 4 pieces of chicken. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!   Zablongs $10 unlimited toppings, wheat crust for no up charge, 8 slices. When you ask for extra goat cheese you actually get it. Customer service of the employee writing your name in BBQ sauce, oh yeah which is included in the price and they honor 10% cash back for Yelp members.   I have no idea why I would ever go to Pizza Peel again.",

The staff is friendly, though, and they'll help out if something is wrong.  Specialty pizzas are always a hit, and their \"secret\" menu offers great ideas for pizzas when you're stumped on choosing toppings.  They cook late night on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes a great alternative to the same old late night pizza options in the neighborhood.  The beer selection is great, offering several craft beers on tap. The selection rotates, and they offer half pints and flights for people who want to try out a few beers in one visit. I also noticed they have a decent bottled beer selection, offering such gems as Brooklyn Black Ops. Not too shabby.  Overall, great spot. Can't give it five stars because of the service and food getting mixed up occasionally when it's busy, but I'll keep going back.",

One of her friends recommended Pizza Peel, so we gave it a shot tonight. The hostesses were absolutely gracious and very welcoming. This was our very first time even setting foot in this place. After giving our name for a table, we decided to head to the bar for a drink. The place was crowded. The female bartender came over to me and looked right at me. No smile, no welcome, she just stared at me, waiting for me to initiate the greeting. I said \"How are you tonight?\" She continued to stare at me, no smile, no \"great thanks, what can I get you\"? So I thought maybe she didn't hear me, so I said again, \"How are you tonight?\" Still nothing? She wanted no part of being welcoming or nice. She was absolutely rude & obnoxious. Made me feel so unwelcome. We go out to dinner often and always \"talk up\" great places to friends, co workers, etc.....This female bartender absolutely blew it! We left, kindly asked the hostesses to take our names off the wait list and shared our experience with them. The hostesses were apologetic and very professional. Sad part is, they were probably in their late teens and they were so much more professional, kind, courteous and customer service oriented than the female bartender. I will not be going back. I have the choice to spend my dining, drinking money at so many places near where we live. Charlotte has so many opportunities. It is too bad that one grumpy, disrespectful and obnoxious bartender can ruin an experience not just for one couple, but all the other people we will be sharing our experience with.",

We have never been disappointed with anything on the menu, but our favorites are their amazing bruschetta with crostini, phenomenal Greek pizza, and the chopped salad with cloves of roasted garlic. Great beer selection with a good list of North Carolina brews. When the weather is nice it is the best with plenty to keep my son occupied for a relaxing afternoon. Disc golf goal, corn hole boards, and a popsicle stand. Their staff always takes care of us, and the managers are very personable giving it that comforting mom and pop feel! All in all I highly recommend pizza peel!",

It looks great inside and out, they did a really good job of making it comfortable, modern, etc. I've been to the original Pizza Peel a few times and really liked it so I was excited to have one in my neighborhood.  The place looks great, good service and pizza was good. Unfortunately, unlike the original, they do not have any good lunch deals and after spending $30 for two people on pizza and a side salad, they charged $1 for sides of ranch. I like Pizza Peel and happy they are in our neighborhood but rather than a great place to grab a pizza and beer, they are treating it like a high end restaurant and nickel and diming their local customers.   I would go again but just for a pitcher. Otherwise, back to Fuel Pizza!",

I'm so glad we did.   After 3 visits, we have not one negative comment. We found all of the staff to be nice and helpful. There is a wide variety of craft beers that go so well with the pizza.  You will find pizzas with traditional toppings but also some unusual ones too.  Example on New Years day, they had a special pizza that contained barbeque, black eyed peas, etc. to cover the traditional Southern New Years menu.  If that's not your thing they have pepperoni, sausage, pineapple, etc. My personal favorite is the Thai pizza.  Try a flight of beers to decide which you like.",

I dined in with my family as well as some another family. For starters we had to ask for some of the chairs to be cleaned off before we could sit. The hostess brought all the kids kid's menus but no crayons to do the activities.  I ordered a gluten-free pizza for my son and a regular pizza for myself. In both cases we substituted goat cheese for the traditional mozzarella.  I was fine with the upcharges for the cheese as well as the gluten free crust. There was no gluten free price option noted on the menu and the waiter didn't even know what it was.  But what was most disappointing was when the pizzas came out. The toppings were so skimpy and the taste was pretty flavorless. If I am paying more for toppings (especially premium ones) I expect to get a generous portion.   My friend ordered a bbq pizza and the bbq sauce was literally drizzled on the pizza. She asked for some extra sauce.  When her bill came there was a 50 cents upcharge. The manager did remove it after she complained.    Overall I was extremely disappointed and am pretty sure that I will not be returning.",

That should have been by first clue, but considering myself lucky we went in for some beers and a pizza.  The pros here are on tap.  Many fine local beers to choose from and surely you can find one (or many) that you like.  I was really hopeful for good pizza too, it's in the name.  It wasn't anything special and I've had boxed pizza's from the frozen food aisle that have more flavor.  The group I was with wasn't impressed either.  Maybe if the name of the food is in your name it should be the shining star.  I'm not brave enough to try another menu item if your main dish can't reel me in.  Service was just alright, not bad, but not great.  Nothing overly special here, now I understand how I got in and out so easily on a Saturday Night.  Good luck Pizza Peel.",

It's the same as the good ol' original in Cotswold, but with a slightly different interior layout and a much more awesome patio.   Same great beer selection, amazing fish tacos (of which I will argue are the best in town), and that killer Secret Pizza Menu. Definitely worth a gander if you've never had a chance to do so.   The factor that makes me want this location in the ATL is the disc golf basket out front. Not only is it a perfect distraction for the kids to go out and play, but it's a great way to kill some time al fresco with a beer in hand. Really love what they've done with this spot. A definite plus to the choices in Plaza.",

Loved the intimate experience listening to music, drinking beer great Pinot Noir and eating delicious pizza! The best part is that you can pick two specialty pizzas to have within the personal 8\" pie. I tried the Updyke and Thai. Highly recommend the Updyke :)",

    "text": "I have eaten at this shop a couple times now and have been pleased with the food every time. I think what sets The Pizza Peel ahead of it's competition is the crust. It's not too thick and cooked well enough that it doesn't get all soggy to where the toppings slide off. The crust also has a very nice wheat/ground corn meal flavor.  They have a decent beer selection. Nothing as extensive as Mellow Mushroom or Revolution. Also, I don't believe they do mixed drinks either. Anyway, we're here for the pizza, right?  The inside is a little cramped. Well the hole place isn't really very spacious. They do have a small lawn outside with a disc gold net often swarmed with children in the day time.  I would definitely recommend The Pizza Peel if you're looking for some great tasting pizza in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I went to pizza peel on 9/8/16 and had pizza and wings. I like the pizza. I've had their pizza before but they really need to get out of the wing game or step it up. I ordered the bbq. The wings are breaded which is fine but if the wings are going to be breaded and then sauced please let the wings have flavor!!! Please let the sauce have flavor!! Please make your wings well done and crispy. No one who orders wings wants tough wings! Charlotte has a few really great wing spots. Take note and do your pings better and get more customers. If you want wings go somewhere else. If you want pizza go here. The pizza is ok.",

    "text": "The Pizza Peel was  on our to-do list for awhile. We went with high expectations due to all of the amazing reviews. It was average at best. The garlic knots were decent. The pizza was just okay. The sauce was plain and the cheese wasn't cooked enough for my liking.  It wasn't bad but I don't think I'll be coming back. There are too many other great pizza options in Charlotte. If I do come back, I will probably have to try something else.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try a new place in my neighborhood.  We were greeted by two very bubbly and friendly young ladies at the hostess booth.  They said that they would have our table ready in five minutes.....and they delivered!  The server promptly took our drink order and all was good. I have to admit.  We are spoiled by the excellent pizza at Asheville Brewing Company, so we hold that as our standard.  The menu here featured self creations and a specialty pizza section.  We decided to go with a predesigned pizza labeled \"Positive Friction.\"  The menu described it as being topped with pesto, feta, sun dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella.  We found the pizza crust to be dry, the toppings weren't juicy, and the cheese wasn't stringy.  It appeared to have been made in the past, frozen, and popped into the oven.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't stand out.  We do want to support our neighborhood businesses, so we will stop by again.  Next time, we will design our own pizza to see if it meets our juicy,  stringy expectations. P.S.  Kudos to Pizza Peel for featuring a nice amount of vegetarian options!",

Even though there was a game on we received no service, the waitress took out order and never returned I to ask for the check from the ambivalent host and go to the bar to pick up a carry out box. The food was good and I thought this could be a place I would bring my family but I was wrong.",

    "text": "This was my second time eating dinner at the new Plaza Midwood Pizza Peel. I'd eaten at the Cotswold one once or twice but it never really blew my skirt up for some reason. I really like the Plaza Midwood location though. I got there early and sipped on a Brooklyn Porter while I waited for the hubs to meet me after work. (The draft beer list is good - something for everyone I think.) The waitress was super friendly and let me sit there and read my book in peace while I waited and drank my beer. Hubs showed up after about ten minutes and we started perusing the menu.   We both decided on pizza, though last time I had one of the pastas and it was really good. I was curious to try the pizza to see how it compared to the other spot. Turns out it's way better. The crust was thin but not crispy and there was just the right amount of cheese and sauce. It seemed a lot less greasy than the one I had at Cotswold too. I like my pizza plain, but hubs tried the hot chipotle tomato sauce and some meats (and anchovies, ew). He was super excited about his pie and he's pretty picky about REALLY liking something. I tend to think he LIKES just about everything, but raves about very few things. So I knew it must be good. I think the flavor, consistency and ingredients all came together nicely and it was just really good, simple pizza.   This location does get pretty noisy when it gets busy, which I experienced last time but not this one. It was a slower night. Also, the patio comprises a few long picnic tables, so even though it was beautiful outside, I opted to sit inside since there were only going to be two of us. But we were seated right next to one of the large garage door windows, which was open to a screen door and it let in some of the lovely afternoon. It's a good spot to people watch as people walk by on Central.  All in all, this was a really positive visit with good food and good service. We'll definitely be back.",
