    "text": "Stopped in at draught on a gorgeous early April, midweek afternoon about 1:30p.  Sat just inside the open garage doors.  My bride of 36 years, our daughter #2 and I...visiting daughter #1 who was hard at work preparing for a Charlotte Knights home opener.  The place was ours for the taking! An easy, relaxed day that this triad hadn't had in some time.  We enjoyed the Korean Bulgogi Lettuce wraps with jullianned carrots, cucumbers and pickled red onions and the house avocado salsa with chips (actually fresh house made, deep fried potato chips, not tortilla chips).  Throw in some local brew pulls and our afternoon was complete.  Our first thought was what a fun place for the locals! Good food, good conversation, maybe some good live music if that was in the offing.  The only down side we saw was we would not be around for a second try.  If you are in the Queen City, we recommend a visit",

    "text": "I was visiting Charlotte for a job functions and yelped this nice little spot. Great view of the stadium and awesome service. The bartender was probably the best one I had in two months. I got some wings and they were crispy and flavorful just like I expected.   My only concern/drawback is that the fries just weren't that good. They were the old fashioned kind and they may have been fresh but those are just so hard to tell about.   Overall I was very pleased with my food and so was my friend. I thought that the bartender was awesome and his service really made it for me.",

There was live music set up outside that was fun to listen to, but not too loud that you couldn't hold a dinner conversation.   We started with grilled wings with sauce made from OMB Copper and pork wings made with a cheer wine sauce. They both tasted delicious. They feature a lot of dishes with duck in them and a great build your own burger in which you can have a burger patty or a portabella cap. The Third Ward Special was very unique -- duke confit on a warmed roll with duck jus. It may taste gamey for some people's taste, but we really enjoyed it.   We will definitely be going back to try more from the menu.",

    "text": "First let me say that the interiors are pretty awesome.  I like the feel of the place and the patio looks like a solid place to hang out and day drink or relax in general.  The food choices are unique and I'll have to explore more next time but this visit I had the lettuce wraps.  They were tasty and great but a bit of a tough one to eat with out chewing like a rabid dog.  I know korean beef is tough so maybe I should have thought that through.  My advice, if you're on a first date, don't get the wraps.  You'll make a mess most likely.  The staff was struggling during our visit it seemed but I noticed they started to get plates out quicker as our lunch hour went on.  The beer list seemed solid, although I kind of expected a more unique list of taps available.  With a name like Draught I just imagined a more extensive variety.    The parking seems a little limited but not impossible.",

    "text": "Oh Draught...I WANT to like you.  I really do.  But each time I give you another try I wonder why I went back...a place so confused by its identity that even the serving staff wears shirts with the phonetic spelling displayed across the front so patrons can get it right.  This place has the making of what would be a cool place to brunch, or grab drinks to watch the game but each time I'm left disappointed and feeling shortchanged.  A few weeks ago, some girlfriends and I decided to try this place for Sunday brunch.  I was the first to arrive and walked into an empty bar with a group of female servers surrounding the hostess stand, likely meeting before the shift began.  Not knowing they had not opened for business yet, I walk in expecting to be sat.  Instead, they all stared at me, whispering to each other when finally, perhaps the hostess, asked me what I was doing there.  I said I came for brunch and she then told me they were not open and to wait outside.  I obliged and went outside.  Being a nice day, we asked to sit on the patio once we were allowed to be sat.  We were guided to a soaking wet table/chairs so asked for a cloth to wipe them dry.  The server got a cloth from the bar and let us do it for ourselves.  Once we were finally sitting, the server brought us their limited gameday menu (I'm assuming this is their menu every Sunday in the fall) and it consisted of Nachos, Chicken Wings, and a few other items that don't sound too appetizing for brunch.  Based on the experience at that point, we ended up apologizing and leaving to go somewhere else.  I decided to try this place again this weekend to watch the Clemson Game.  The setup for the game was awesome- TVs and screens everywhere!  The service and food, however, was not.  Our server was very unfamiliar with what was behind the bar and on tap.  We ordered the wings- how can you mess up wings?  Personally, I'm a fan of crispy wings.  These were exactly the opposite.  The only way I can thing to describe them is they seemed like they were boiled and sauce was put on them still wet.  Not good.  Our table even joked that the sauce tasted better off our fingers than it did on the wings themselves.  The plus side- the blue cheese was really good.",

    "text": "I'm so excited to see a nice bar near my house!  With that being said, Draught is fraught with little issues that niggled at me. Yes, by the way I know Draught and fraught don't rhyme. First, atmosphere is great. Lots of wood to counter the slightly industrial feel. Small without being tiny with the bar deviding the 2 dining spaces. Second, help is amazing. Friendly with out being overbearing.  We kinda quizzed the bartender about our food and she knew exactly what kind of cheese was on our Flatbread. Bravo! Third, manager was very present on the floor which I appreciate but was also a little creepy. I think he knows I'm yelping this and peering  over my shoulder, yikes.  Fourth, the food.  So sad but also so common.  We had the pulled pork Flatbread and the fried green tomatoes. Flatbread, one word...DRY. a nice melted warm cheese would have been great on that. Fried green tomatoes, oi-vay. I'm from Florida and consider myself a bit of an expert in this area.  Cardinal rule, don't over bread, cause the tomatoes doesn't actually cook. And pan fry, not fryer.  Ugh, so not delicious.   Good start with adding the goat cheese but a long way to go. Regular Italian breadcrumb breading from Sysco, sad cause could be awesome. Final word we will be back for the great craft beers and atmosphere.",

I could see this being an issue if it's busier.   The decor/atmosphere is relaxed and casual.   The food. We ordered the Parmesan pretzels and avocado salsa. The pretzels were super salty. We had to scrape off all the salt/Parmesan to make them edible. The cheese dip was tasty but quickly became a solid because it wasn't quite hot enough.  The avocado salsa was tasty but came with potato chips - some which were soggy. It made the salsa difficult to eat.   For my main dish I got the whiskey chicken. The chicken had nice flavor. The dish came with potatoes and brussel sprouts. The potatoes were dry and brussel sprouts just tasted like they had been char grilled with no seasoning.  Overall it was okay. It wasn't bad. It wasn't wonderful.  The service was attentive.    I'll probably go back and give lunch a shot.",

But tonight a bouncer who said he needed to \"let the heat out\" by opening the front door, when it is freezing outside, causing everyone in the downstairs bar to be uncomfortable and miserable, was so incredibly rude and dismissive when multiple people complained. We all asked that the door be closed. He refused, saying people were complaining about the heat. Not True. No one, and we asked, complained about heat. The bar was a great temperature until the bouncer decided to prop the door open against everyone's wishes. We asked to speak to the manager and when the bouncer dismissed us again we met and spoke to his boss. This employee door shut for us. But it was so unnecessary to have to go through the annoyance and discomfort. Makes me reconsider ever coming back if the comfort of the patrons isn't a top priority.",

We ordered the fried pimento cheese fritters for an app...oh so amazing!  I got the fried green tomato blt and my coworker ordered the steak sandwich.  Both items were great!

Yes please!! Surprisingly Draught is packed for Sunday brunch so make your reservation ahead of time. They have a special brunch menu that includes chicken n waffles, salmon benedict and shrimp n grits. However Sunday brunch will not be held during football season. Salt.   LUNCH I've been here multiple times for lunch. Sometimes service is slow, but the food never disappoints. I recommend the blueberry spinach salad with goat cheese and salmon. Yum!   HAPPY HOUR Titos Tuesdays features $5 Moscow Mules. On Mondays they have half of wings and $3 select drafts! Wine Wednesdays also feature half off bottles. Their appetizers are also great. I recommend the pretzel with beer cheese.   PREGAME Draught is becoming the new hot spot for all pre gaming and tailgating. During panthers games they usually close the parking lot and have beer carts out. They also have DJs come-making this place poppin before and after games.",

So we walk in and no one greets us.  We stand at the hostess station for a long time and a girl says \"do you need a table?\" We told her we did and while walking away says \"you can sit wherever\".  Um ok...so we sit down and she chats with coworkers and shows them her elbow that she hurt and talks and laughs and THEN comes to bring menus.  We ordered a beer, which took forever to come.  Then we ordered food, which took about 25 min on a non busy day.  I asked the waitress for ranch dressing which is an extra .50, and she seemed to have a hard time finding any.  It took until I was almost done with my food to bring the ranch.  She stood in the window arguing with the kitchen about who stocked the ranch and where it was for about 15 min.  She was very rude, the bartender was very rude and it was a huge disappointment.  The food was not as good as the sample I had.  The short ribs were very fatty.  It really made me sad.  I thought for sure if they made it a point to come to a YELP event and advertise, that they would make sure to be on the top of their game.",

    "text": "Draught feels like a rough draft. It has a lot of potential but missed the mark on several points.  Situated in the shadows of the Panthers stadium and offering a nice view of uptown from the patio, Draught caters to a lot of the uptown bankers after work as well as some of the locals.It appears to be an old textile mill with wooden floors and brick interiors and exteriors.  The menu advertises \"house made pasta\" made in someone else's house (Pasta and Provisions) however they were out of it.  My wife ordered a salmon burger but they were out of that.  She opted for a veggie burger instead and I got a regular burger.  It was decent but at $12 it was a little overpriced.  They have a decent amount of beers on tap, but not as much as I expected with a name like Draught.    Our waitress was okay but we had to ask for napkins.  My wife asked for may for her veggie burger since there was no sauce on it.  She waited a little bit for the mayo and then the waitress did not bring anything to use to put it on the bun.  I went to use the restroom and the men's room on the main floor was closed.  They directed me to one in the basement where there is another bar and more tables.  Our experience would have been a lot better if not for the points mentioned above.  I have a feeling they never have the pasta, but when a place is out of the first two of three things you want to order, you have to wonder how the place is being operated.  If the management can't order the product that's on the menu, can they really operate the place well?  The waitress did give us a 20% off card to use next time.  We'll use it and hopefully I can come back and add a star to this review.",

Things have mostly been bland tasting.   The brunch is pretty good and love their make your own mimosa bar. It's also a great spot for happy hour and before/after a panthers game.

Not great. (For those keeping track, VBGB still has the best pretzel in Charlotte!)  Recently we were here for drinks and got hungry. I was craving Cracker Barrel (pancakes for the win!) but the ridiculous storm outside caused us to just stay at Draught. I got the Caesar melt (since they don't have wraps - boooooo!) with fries. Both were good but not great. My boyfriend got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and greens. I tasted his and was not a fan.   In conclusion, this place isn't the worst. It also isn't the best. I would eat there again if I was already there but certainly wouldn't make a special trip there for anything.",

We made a reservation online cause I heard it can get busy (there was a very long wait by the time we left).  There is a BYO mimosa bar and bloody mary bar, which we definitely tried out. I love the build your own component cause i was able to put my own juices and fruit in my mimosa! Such a cool touch!  Ordered the cinnamon buns, corn waffle with BBQ, and side of bacon to split. The bacon wasn't anything special. However, those cinnamon buns!! They came out on a hot skillet. So delish! The corn waffle with bbq was also very tasty and had a good portion of bbq on it!  Draught's brunch game is very strong. I still havent gotten the whole thing of playing loud DJ music for brunch, but to each their own. Great spot to just chill out on a Sunday!",

I went recently for an away game and it was a different experience. We sat at the bar downstairs which wasn't super crowded and our bartender was pretty slow. She forgot our waters and looked inconvenienced every time we would ask for something. I also thought it was strange how they only serve brunch until 4 on Sundays. It's an odd combination. Either be a sports bar or brunch location but they don't do a good job of pulling off both. When I'm drinking beer and watching the game I want fries or a pretzel not an omelet or egg sandwich. The DJ was good and it does get pretty crowded which is fun. But just an odd place.",

    "text": "If only Yelp let me give half stars, this would be a 4.5! After buying a Living Social deal that got us $30 in food, the fella and stopped in on a Thursday after work. What took us so long to try this place??  We were lucky to snag a parking spot in the lot outside, and we got there before it got crazy full (like it was when we left). Local beers were on special, so that's what we stuck with. For a place called Draught, the beers on tap were a little... underwhelming. However, we pressed on. The inside is pretty cozy with wood paneling and huge, windowed garage doors that run the length of the place. We sat at a table, but the bar was pretty cool and seemed to U-shape around the dining area.  Since duck was everywhere on the menu, we started with the duck tacos (3 for $9), and they were deeeelicious. For dinner, I got the Blueberry Walnut Salad with chicken ($13), and it was bowl-licking good. I loved that it came in a bowl deep enough that everything didn't spill over the side when I tried to mix it up. The fella almost went with the meatloaf, but switched to the Pork Wings (5 for $11) when he saw the guy at the table next to us get them. I never got a bite, but considering he was gnawing on the bone, I'd say they were pretty good.  Besides the underwhelming draft list, the only other reason I'd knock off a smidgen of a star was the acoustics. There were a decent amount of people in there for sure, but it was so loud we had to yell at each other, and it didn't seem like it should've been that loud.  Surprisingly good food at what I always thought was just a bar!",

I have never seen a French dip with duck confit, and I will tell you it was absolutely amazing.  I had a really hard time decking on a few different things, which gives me an excuse to go back. Really cool looking industrial building, outdoor seating if you choose. The bar staff is super friendly and helped me pick what I wanted when I said I was deciding between two things she pushed the duck French dip.

I had the nachos which were fantastic -- came with pulled pork, tons of cheese -- and they use crinkle cut potato chips which seemed homemade. I also had the pub burger which was solid...not out of this world but pretty good.   Service was great as our server constantly checked in and kept the cold beer coming. This place is right next to the BOA stadium and I can totally see it doing well on game days. Overall, I have no complaints about this place.

Our server was great, very friendly and attentive, she checked up on us at least 4 times during our dinner service and poured all our wine glasses. We went with a Red Blend from Chile, pretty good, I was kinda buzzed after the first glass. I ordered the shrimp and grits while the bf ordered a customized burger with a garlic mashed potato side. The food came our fairly quickly and smelled delicious. I have never had shrimp and grits before, but it was a Draught fav so what the hell, why not. I looked amazing though the grits had more of a solid mashed potato-y texture which I had never seen before. I am SO glad I went with this dish, the gravy was so spicy (earthy spice) and flavorful. This def has me hooked on shrimp and grits, why haven't I tried this before?!? The cheddar cheese grits were also great. Its just a wonderful dish all around. The bf said his burger was good, not Bad Daddy's good, but it worked out.   I loved how we were able to use our Groupon on top of the 50% off wine bottles! What a great deal! We will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Considering how much time I spend in this place, I thought it was time for a review update. I also just sat here and read a bunch of reviews, and it made me want to address and point out a few things. Oh and once again remind you, Draught is pronounced like draft.   Food wise: I love the pork wings and all the tacos. I usually always order whatever the egg roll of the week is with my meal. House nachos are great. They're super different and a nice southern twist on a classic bar food. A pretzel and beer cheese are the way to my heart. The Third Ward Special has been one of my favorites since the beginning. I saw someone complain and say they wished it wasn't duck. Well, if you want one that's not duck, go somewhere else. Or better yet, open your own place. Sounds silly right? Well, now think how silly you sound for saying it. Draught also has great specials throughout the week. $5 Tito's Mules on Tuesdays, half price wine on Wednesdays, Thirsty Thursdays.   This is THE spot for Panthers games. If you think you're going to come in here and get a 5 course meal by candlelight, this isn't the place to come on game day. Come on, man. It's not rocket science. Of course there's a limited game day menu. Of course it's slammed. Of course service may be a little slower. Of course there's a line for the bathroom. Don't get mad if they won't put the Broncos game on for you. Guess what? It's a Panthers bar. And they can't accommodate five different people's requests to see the Broncos, Cowboys, fill in the blank other team that one person wants to watch. College football wise, they are home to Clemson and Michigan State. Don't walk in here on a Saturday and be shocked to see 200 Clemson fans. And again, don't bitch because they have a game day menu. I assume brunch will be back after football season. Two words: MIMOSA BAR. Any place that let's me buy a bottle of champagne and dress it up with a whole bunch of different juices and fruits wins in my book.  Draught has a great event space downstairs. I've attended engagement, birthday, holiday, and even draft (not to be confused with Draught) parties here. It's a good space you can pretty much dress up for whatever occasion. I love the roll up garage doors and patio area as well. Nice spot to grab after work drinks.   Kudos to the staff. Between setting up tailgates and outdoor areas and dealing with the army of drunk people who wander over after the game, I know gamedays are long days. Thanks for giving Charlotte such a great place to cheer on the Panthers! Rarrrrrrrrr",

Came back, sat down...watched the bartender walk past me several times, ring stuff in to the register (right in front of me) and... nothing. He was more interested in keeping his hair in place I think.   A he walked past me once again I (yes, loudly) said hello!?  can I get a menu. and a drink.  and some food.  It ended up being funny because the girl sitting next to me leaned over and said she had to do the same thing.  I did order a mimosa and got to add my own juice to it, which isn't that big a deal. I'd rather just have the choice and have the bartender take care of the whole thing.   The bartender did give me a glass of bubbly \"on him\" to make up for his inattention, but kind of ruined it by sticking his finger in it to flick something out of it.  (alcohol kills germs, right?)  So I got the egg rolls which were pizza egg rolls.  They were very good.  Crispy, good pepperoni and cheese ratio.    The Flank Steak Sandwich was also very good.  I got it on a brioche which held up well.  Plenty of meat, good amount of cheese, mushrooms and grilled onions.  It came with horseradish cream sauce, but I wish I had gotten a side of it because there wasn't enough.  I had asked for some honey dressing on the side to go with my sweet potato fries and also horseradish sauce on the side, but the bartender didn't remember to bring either one of them and I got tired of asking him to remember.  I had to ask him twice for my beer.  They have a good amount of beers and plenty of local ones.  I like it the food, but I think (at least at the bar) the service doesn't do the kitchen justice.  Not a football or any other major sports day, and not a lot of people in, so not sure what was up with the bartender.",

It was a Thursday evening and we got there before the Thursday Night Football crowd.  No wait for a table, and our waitress let us pa ruse the menu before deciding on Pimento Cheese Fritters and the 3rd Ward Special:  Smoked Duck French Dip sandwich and fries.  The place had me at \"Pimento Cheese\" but when you fry it up into awesome bites, it just makes it that much better!  The smoked duck french dip was so delicious that it was pretty much gone in 60 seconds.  There is a rather large parking area for being that close to uptown and the space is super nice.  I like the use of wood and modern/clean lines.  There are tv's galore for watching games/sports and a good selection of local beers on tap.  I can see this place being a great place to meet up and tailgate before a Panthers game and/or even a Knights baseball game.",

They have quite a list of NC brewed beers and a yummy menu to complement. I love the Korean BBQ Wraps! The House Nachos with pulled pork and house-made chips are also delish. Don't bother with the Hoisin-Glazed Scallops, there are several other yummy items on the menu (like the Pub Burger!) Overall the food, atmosphere and overall vibe are pretty awesome! I've been here on a regular night and also during a Michigan State game (I.e when Draught bleeds green) and it's always an amazing time. They even have a projector downstairs to house these infamous Michigan State games (this is a Michigan State bar btw) and of course, Panthers games!",

I'm usually one for change but this was not a good change on Draughts end. No pork nachos anymore :( they moved in to Totchos... please leave the totchos to Flight bar, that's their thing. Ok enough about new menu changes....   We both ordered a classic burger medium and medium well. We got the burgers and they were basically raw meat with a few grill marks on them. Can't believe we both actually ate 2 bites before looking at each other in disgust. The server said they just had their grill serviced yesterday so they're not sure what happened. I couldn't bring myself to let them cook us new ones but they did comp the meal. The sweet potato fries are a winner though!  I ordered a beer and they still, despite apologizing a few times, gave me a check and expected me to pay for this horrible experience. I would imagine in the service industry you'd do a little more than say sorry after possibly giving your guests food poisoning and expecting them to pay the bill and come back again....",

Drinks after work with apps, a quick great dinner on a weeknight instead of cooking, and brunch on sundays.  Fast forward to this past week.  The new brunch menu is bland and has tiny portions for the price compared to everywhere else in the city.  They got rid of their best apps, as well of all of their best sides.  The dinner menu is baren, and unless you want a salad or a plain burger with cheese you're out of luck.  I really hope they can find a way to reverse all of the changes they've made.  The best advice I can give them is if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Unfortunately right now, they're trying to drive a car with no wheels.",

They always say it's because of a new chef and that they often get complaints about the menu options. Perhaps they should listen to customer feedback and take action to improve. And replace this new chef and his new empty menu lol. Disappointing because it used to be one of my favorite places with a pretty good menu, friendly staff, and varied beer selection. I suppose the beer selection still remains.",

The entire basement was full of the Charlotte Clemson Alumni Club, and we pulled off a miraculous win, so we we're already off to a great start.    I was feeling like death from the night before.  I started of with a $4 bloody mary, that ended up being too strong for my still weak stomach, and switched to just bloody mary mix for a while.  The drink prices were awesome, with tons of $4 drinks and $15 dollar bottles of champagne.    They had a limited menu for game day, and a lot of the food seemed a little heavy for my circumstances, but I opted for a soft pretzel which was huge and delicious!   This is a great sports bar to watch a game with super cheap drinks.  They were very accommodating of our rowdy group of eight girls.",

Our server was very pleasant and the food was edible, that's the only reason I'm giving two stars.   When a restaurant serves breakfast I'd generally think coffee is a standard request. Apparently not here since they had to make a pot and they also didn't have cream. So after bringing drinks our waitress took our order, corned beef hash and short rib Benedict. About 30 minutes later she returned to tell us they didn't have short rib. Not sure why that would take 30 minutes to find out. The order took about another 15 minutes after that. Waiting 45 minutes for a breakfast order in a half empty restaurant is a bit long, but if the food was good it would have been worth it. All the food was underwhelming, corned beef hash looked like it was out of a can and tasted similar, \"hash browns\" were just basic breakfast potatoes like you'd buy in the frozen section of the grocery store. Not the worst food I've ever had, but definitely the worst in recent memory. If you do go here I definitely would recommend ordering something else.",

Have been here many of times and its normally busy which is fine but the last couple visits and especially today the bartenders were absolutely horrible. I just waited 30 minutes with an empty drink. If its a staffing issue thats not my problem. But from a business perspective I should have had a couple drinks in that time frame. Then my scrambled eggs that took 40 minutes to come out were burnt and disgusting. Meanwhile your man bun clown of a bartender is dancing behind the bar dancing and playing on his phone. I had two vodka and red-bulls and on the third he gives me sugar free red-bull so I asked him to correct it and he says next time specify please. The last two drinks I had were with regular red-bull so what did I need to specify? If I wanted sugar-free that would be the specification. Don't try to blame a paying customer for your mistake.  I live a block away from here and will legitimately never come back. Do yourself a favor and walk 1000 yards- pass the stadium and go to one of the 100 places uptown that will provide far better food and service.

Service was dodgy... beers were never kept full and our waitress seemed stretched thin over all of her tables on the patio and indoors. She said it was taking so long because so many were ordering Guinness, the drink special. It just seemed like they were understaffed.  My dad complained to me about the line for the bathroom. I guess the mens room is a one seater and a urinal, but there aren't stalls, so everyone was waiting in the hall.  If there was a line for the mens, I'm glad I didn't have to try he womens!  The food was good... but when you name the establishment Draught, I would experience more of a craft beer selection. Even with 30 taps, they were lacking variety.",

We never received silverware until after our food was dropped by a chef that said nothing to us and then I went in to get us silverware myself.  We got the wings, paid extra to have them roasted as opposed to 'fried crispy,' and once our waitress finally came back to check us I asked for a side of the wing sauce since they didn't have much on them and she then took about 10 minutes to make that happen.

    "text": "1st time visiting this place since they opened last year. I used to patron the old establishment (Hartigan) and for the most part the layout is the same... meaning this is not a big place.  I made an reservation on OpenTable for a party of 3, and were immediately sat when 2 of us showed up first. Waitress did not greet us for awhile, it was ok since we're waiting for the 3rd person to arrive, but that could be improved.  The menu itself is intriguing. They offer alot of duck dishes, which is great for someone who loves duck, but I find it to be an odd choice for others. Lucky for me, I love duck. I ordered the mushroom arugula flatbread as an app to share. My friends liked it, I find it a little standard - not much mushroom flavor, alot of sweetness from the glaze. Quite crusty and thick for a flatbread, but for $6 it is a good option.  I ordered the duck tacos  as my entree. It tasted a lot like the flatbread - sweet and with arugula. 3 good size tacos for $9. Not too strong of duck flavor for those who may not like a strong duck taste. Good for an entree, as it's alot for an appetizer even for 2 people to share.  My friends ordered the meatloaf and the shrimp & grits, and the shrimp & grits stole the show overall. Very flavorful and plentiful. If you are a fan of shrimp & grits, you should try this.  Overall I was happy with my dinner, granted not blown away by either the service or food. Will definitely come back and give it another try. Solid 3.5 stars...",

    "text": "I was recently lamenting that FreeMoreWest didn't have a neighborhood bar, and poof! Draught announces their opening. Why, thank you alcoholic Genie for granting me my wish!   I went to the soft opening and was really impressed by the comfortable, stylish interior that isn't trying too hard. I loved the open front with the garage doors, lots of TVs and private dining room downstairs you can rent for company events, family parties, etc. They added some picnic tables outside on the patio in the shadow of the uptown skyline, which is lovely in the evening. Personally I get claustrophobic with big crowds so I'm not going to be one to go on game days, but good for them for making it a huge destination. During the Steelers pregame, the whole parking lot was crazy.   This is called Draught so I should focus on the beer and bar, but I'm not an expert on that so let me focus on where my talents lie. As others mentioned, they do not have the typical boring bar food, and I really appreciate that they have lower fat items too.  I've been for both lunch and dinner and their lunch menu has lots of gourmet delicious salads like Cranberry Apple Salad with grilled chicken and maple cider vinaigrette or Warm Kale salad and even a lemon dijon salmon burger (which I really really enjoyed!!) I can't wait to try the turkey cornbread sandwich too.   They also have a kids menu for the littles.  Their appetizers take some classics and turn them on their head like Root Beer or Cheerwine BBQ wings, or crab stuffed deviled eggs, and pimento cheese fritters (the stud's favorite, though not the healthiest). We also tried the egg roll of the week one time and it was chicken enchiladas, and it was surprisingly delicious!   For dinner, their entrees are definitely beyond what you'd expect from a bar: how about a Crown Royal Maple Glazed Smoked Duck Breast over a bed of wilted Purple Kale and Wild Rice or Hoisin Glazed Scallops over cucumber slaw and Orange Jalapeno Vinaigrette (good but definitely lighter). I really enjoyed the Paleo-friendly Bulgogi steak Lettuce wraps. Perfect dinner choice for me. The pasta with garlic shrimp was really enjoyed by my hubs, but I hated the chicken with pineapple marinade. I am hoping they replace that chicken dish with something else.   If you like finishing off a dinner with something sweet like me, they bring in desserts from a pastry chef in town but I am surprised to report the berry tart was To. Die. For. Definitely worth the calories.   Service is friendly, frequent and really prompt, even when it's a busy Saturday night which is appreciated.  Bottom line: 4.5 stars, great underrated lunch spot, and fantastic casual place to meet friends for a drink and gourmet grub.",

Over time the food seems to cooked with less care then when we first started going, but it is still better then average Pub food.  Not as wide a beer selection as some of the larger Pubs but you can find something to like.  Wait staff is generally attentive but not overly friendly.  They often seem to usually have friends at the bar and spend more time talking to them then serving.",

The staff are all very friendly, competent and knowledgable about their menus.  I started with the special Moscow Mule and a Franzikaner (weissbeer), both super yummy! We had a party of 10 and split: duck tacos (Oh My God!!!!), pretzels w beer cheese (sinfully delicious carbs!), nachos (instead of tortilla chips they were rippled potato chips - nice twist n yummy), two flatbreads - goat cheese apple and something else (nothing spectacular but good), and pimento fritters (heavenly, the red pepper honey dip isn't even necessary). 1 waitress handled our party with zero issues, including when we split up the bill funky. She definitely deserved her tip and helped us rush out to make our movie time.  I will absolutely go back! Can't wait for warmer weather to enjoy their nice patio too.",

Last night was the first time I went just for dinner and a non-sporting event.   The place has always had a cool lay out - outside seating , bar seating and another level in basement.  It was a Thursday and they had a live band with the doors open for a unique and relaxing setting. The menu has changed some but it's good -  I love the duck tacos, the grilled wings and a steak wrap - don't remember name on menu. This is a fantastic place to watch a game and as I found last night - holds its own as a solid restaurant.  Love this place and would recommend checking it out.",

I arrived at 9:45 and they only had their late night menu available.  Which to me seems kind of early.  Most places kitchen's serve most of their menu until 11.I had the nachos and fried green tomatoes. The goat cheese paired very well with the tomatoes and the nachos were plentiful at a decent price.  The beer selection was average, but our server only knew the brewery names and not what type of beer was being served.  Doh!  This looks like it is going to be a great game day spot and I will be back for food.  Here are the things they need to approve upon.   Late night menu should start late night. Servers need to be educated about drinks. I know this was a lesbian bar, but damn only one at a time in the men's bathroom upstairs? Add a couple urinals and dividers please!",

    "text": "I had very high hopes for this place, as its the new 'home' of the Charlotte MSU Spartan's group.  We showed up early Saturday evening with friends and were asked by a bouncer if we were here for Michigan State.  He told us the MSU game watch was downstairs, but they would ONLY be showing that game there. Since our friends were interested in other games, the bouncer advised us to have a seat in the main dining room, as they were going to have a bunch of games on.   We were greeted, promptly seated, and brought beers from their fairly large draft list. The interior was decorated in a cool way - kind of industrial, with lots of wooden beams. The waitress was nice, but quickly became busy - can't blame her; it was game day!   Our plan was to stick around for some football, have some drinks and maybe get some food. That plan, however, was quickly derailed. After maybe about an hour, every TV was changed to  the Miami game. At first we thought it was a malfunction, because the picture quality was so terrible. In fact, we realized that they were actually streaming this game from someone's computer - you could even see a cursor hovering in the corner.   We asked the waitress if she could get someone to change a couple of the TVs in the area to one of the other 6 games that were going on at the time. She agreed and hurried off, only to return with bad news. She advised us that the front half of the bar was designated for Miami and that the back half had other games on.... but there were no available seats in that area. To make matters worse, a group of rather obnoxious Miami fans were sat next to us.   Part of the experience of going out for a football game is getting there early, staking out the best view in the house, and settling in for some beer and wings. What's the point of getting a table if they are going to change EVERY screen to a different game? Draught succeeded in alienating me and my friends. I can't rate them on their food, because we didn't want to stay to watch a poor feed of a came none of us were interested in.   Better luck next time, Draught.",

We ordered tater tots which should take 3 mins it was over 45. We sat outside and were told that the service was very slow and we were crazy patient but this was extreme. No one told several employees about the \"event\" so this poor man was down stairs trying to sell brisket and no one knew about him. There were supposed to be DJ's but no one showed up. Oh wait another group walked out! Super disappointed since my friend flew here from NH and we chose this as something to do!!! We are leaving!",

    "text": "Host was really cool, we were seated right away...  Service was a letdown. 20 minutes of sitting and no \"hello, I'm such and such, can i get you a something to drink?\" It's hard cause when you're 15 minutes into waiting, you get that awkward, \"Are we gonna get service at all?\" moment. At the 20 minute mark, we got up. I went straight to the host and told her, \"We were sitting for 20 minutes, not a glass of water, no hi or hellos and I'm sorry but we are leaving.\"  I was really excited to eat there too cause their menu was really enticing. We tried to go last night but their kitchen was already closed. Today it was well open and they even had a DJ playing good tunes in their stunning harvest/industrial dining area setting.  I'm sorry the employees truly dropped the ball on this one. When people come and sit in a restaurant, USUALLY they're ready to eat and more than likely really HANGRY.  If a patron didn't get to experience your cuisine, how will they be able to rate the experience.  Sorry, I'll never be back. I took my money down the street at that Tavern that was named after the street it's on. Where we were seated, greeted, ordered our drinks then food came afterwards, all in that order.",

I paid $14 for a basic burger and side salad (with a hair in it). Diet Coke was flat (not a big deal), but just the icing on the cake. Bathroom downstairs didn't even have a trashcan in it to throw away my paper towel? All in all, a decent place to watch the Panthers if it's not absolutely packed, but probably won't be back. Lots of potential, but keeps letting me down.",

The kitchen was a disaster. Our cinnamon rolls came out really late and cold. The fruit on the mimosa bar wasn't replenished on a regular basis. Three people in our party didn't get their food until 5-10 minutes after everyone else got their food. One person it took a good 15-20 minutes. That meal was comped. She ordered the shrimp eggs Benedict, but was served 2 pieces of shrimp on a biscuit with a fried egg on top. Another omelet came out cold. Very disappointing experience. Not sure we will go back.",

My soccer loving friends were disappointed in the lack of intensity from the crowd and believed others were not True soccer fans, but here for happy hour and just supporting USA. Apparently in real soccer fan bars, people are obnoxious and you have to stand up most of the time. I'll take this level of enthusiasm as it seemed people were into it.... Just didn't know all of the soccer chants or give the game their undivided attention.   Additionally, there were mule drink specials for $5 and they weren't stingy with the booze. The raspberry mule proved to be a great choice.  The parking here needs to be extended, as I was cursed out (called a b*tch and everything) over a space. Just lets you know how stressed she was over the parking situation.",

Gone are the dark green walls and clutter above the bar and replaced with lighter walls, reclaimed wood, hard wood floors, and large TVs on the walls. The space behind the bar was also expanded to cover much of the open space to below to create additional restaurant floor space. Knowing what kind of work this place needed, the owners of Draught really put in a lot of work and money in to this restaurant.  They have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but I was not drinking tonight so I could only notice the selections. Next time, I'll try the beer.  The menu consists of an eclectic mix of burgers, salads, apps, entrees and a few flatbread pizzas. I'd describe it more as Gourmet comfort food but the prices and portions were decent.  Service was great here even though our server disappeared for a time between our drink order and our dinner order but she apologized for it and was great with everything afterwards.    So why just 3 stars? Well the first two entrees I selected were unavailable.  They were out of scallops and did not have a pasta dish.  My 3rd option was salmon with a hoison sauce.  The sauce overwhelmed the salmon so I would suggest cutting back on that.  Still, I would like to come back here and give them another try. I see potential here. And I do want to try the beer.",

I had the BBQ chicken Caesar salad which was good and my boyfriend had the pappardelle pasta with chicken instead of shrimp. He said the pasta was very tough, he had to cut it with a knife.

It isn't typical for the fans not to tailgate. So we went inside. It was mass chaos. Nowhere to sit. Limited access to get a drink. Everyone wanted to watch football, but there was a band inside & a DJ outside, so you couldn't hear anything. Even outside we had to shout at each other in conversation. We would have gone somewhere else had it not been such a long walk back to the other bars. It was stifling hot inside, but freezing outside. It was all around a comical situation. We managed to get a drink & an order of tasty nachos & we made the best of it. They do have a nice selection at the bar & a good menu. Thank you for carrying ginger beer! This is probably a fun place when not packed to capacity. Big plus, it is very easy walk to the stadium.",

They seemed to have gotten the biscuits and gravy and it came out cold! Yuck! I got the chicken and waffles which wasn't hot or toasty either. Chicken was a bit lame. Waffles were good. My friend got the omelet. And that was a story! First time she gets it and it's nothing she ordered - chicken and mushrooms and goat cheese and whatnot rather than the bacon and cheddar she'd asked for. So we send it back. Then an omelet comes out again, she puts her USED fork into it and then the waiter runs back, takes it from her and gives it to someone else. Almost threw up watching that. Then the third time, she finally gets her plate (and this is an hour later, and I'm letting my food get cold, nibbling at it, it's just so awkward) and it's missing the biscuit. Not even a surprise at this point. Oh, and also, it took half an hour and asking three times for the coffee to come. Needless to say, Draught had her order on the house but even that won't have me wasting my time there again. Watch out people!",

Seriously, why are there that many bouncers on a Sunday for an away game? I liked that the downstairs had a DJ who plays music during commercials on game day, very fun! My food has not been great though (as a vegetarian). Black bean burger was very dry, as was the flatbread. Fried green tomatoes would be better with the goat cheese served on top rather than cooked inside the breading, because it leaks out during cooking. Fries were underdone and flaccid. I will go back though!",

Also, the most disappointing was the Monday special is 1/2 off chicken wings.  We were told that doesn't apply to this Monday or any Monday there is a big game.  Clemson was playing.  Never seen a place offer a special and advertise it then just say no not tonight.  False advertising.  Also, when game was on it was turned up so loud I couldn't hear myself think.  Great place if you are under the age of 25.",

    "text": "Each time I've been here, the service and food has been terrible. That is, IF you can get a table. A friend and I walked in for brunch and although I counted at least 6 open tables, we were denied because we didn't have a reservation and the hostess offered no other option than to just leave because \"we're full\". The most recent visit was 4-12-15. We arrived at 4:10pm. We were told they don't serve food between 4-5 pm because the kitchen is closed then. So we waited and waited....our server changed 3 times while we were waiting for 5 pm to get food and they couldn't even get our group's drink order correct. They were out of fried green tomotoes, out of anything with duck in it, and out of grilled chicken. How are you out of so much food and you only serve brunch prior to that which doesn't include any of those menu items?! Once we ordered, the entrees came out before our appetizers. All of our drinks were empty. We had to go to the bar to get drinks because that was actually faster than waiting on our server. The shrimp and grits were the worst I've ever had. A giant bowl of cold, runny, flavorless grits that had giant lumps and THREE shrimp in them.....for $14? Ridiculous. Our server seemed to be high and could care less that our service was so bad. She just handed all the checks to a girl at our table for HER to pass out as she just walked off. No pen, no \"thank you\", nothing.",

I really wanted to try the place out as the decor looks awesome and really looked like a fun place but, felt like if you weren't a part of these two teams you weren't welcome. I get the commitment to certain teams but to feel as if your not welcome when there are open tables because that's a certain team spot did not make me want to come back.

    "text": "So after many mixed reviews about Draught I finally decided to try it out for Sunday Brunch. After hearing a few friends mention much they enjoyed the atmosphere there for Brunch my friends went.  Being located so close to uptown, the parking is not the best. It can get hard to drive around the parking lot once its busy and to find a parking space. After parking I went in and placed our name on the waiting list for a party of 8. The hostess said she did not know if she could accommodate that many people and it was 45 minute wait. After walking around to find a spot at the bar to get a drink I saw that there were several parties that had more than 8 in their party so I was confused on why she mentioned my party possibly couldn't be accommodated. Anyway, my friend and I stood at the bar to get a mimosa and the bartender was very short with us and rude for no apparent reason. We ordered mimosas and was informed to go over by the Bloody Mary station to get orange juice or cranberry juice and fruit to add to our champagne. The station only had juice no fruit and no one seemed to know exactly when or if there would be anymore fruit added to the station.  Once we were finally seated inside, the service was pretty slow. It took our waitress awhile to finally come and take our order. My party all ordered at the same time but they brought out our food almost 1 entree at a time. I received my French Toast sandwich first at the table and another entree did not come out for another 10-15 minutes. I did not understand why the whole tables food would not come out together. The French Toast sandwich was not impressive. The chicken was not seasoned and the sandwich itself was not flavorful. No one else in my party was impressed with their food as well all ordered different entrees.  The only thing we enjoyed was the DJ, who was playing a lot of good hits and the half mimosas we ordered.   Once we finally got our tickets and paid, we all walked out the restaurant and immediately behind us a fight broke out between the employees. The same rude bartender that served us in the beginning had a pretty serious altercation with another employee. I was totally disappointed watching this altercation take place. The restaurant had to close for the rest of the day. Sadly this place could be a great spot for drinks after work or Sunday Brunch but it just did not do it for me at all.",

A group of friends and I ran in the Charlotte marathon relay and headed here post-race to grab a bite and a drink. The service was really terrible and I couldn't believe they were so understaffed/under-prepared for a Saturday. The restaurant was full but not overflowing, and the hostess and servers were really struggling. The orders at our table didn't come out together, and we had to remind them what we ordered. Also, our water was not refilled the entire time we were there. I was really disappointed with how disorganized the staff was.  The food itself was decent. I was a little underwhelmed by the vegetarian selections - it would really be nice to find a good sports bar with more than salads for us vegheads. I also enjoyed their mimosa bar but would have liked to see more brunch food options available to match the mimosa vibe.  Really this venue is fine if you need a place to grab a drink and watch a game, but don't expect good food service if you're looking to sit down and have a meal.",

They only bring the champagne and then there is a mimosa bar that you can add your OJ and fruit. Luckily, or table was close to the bar (well shelf with OJ and fruit sitting on it), I would be upset if I had to continuously walk over there every drink I ordered. There was a bar for the bloody mary's too. I don't like the concept. My shrimp and grits came out and it was nasty. The grits were runny. Nothing was seasoned. My BF ordered the burger he said was ok. I don't eat beef, so I didn't try it. His fries were good. All in all, I will not be back, don't waste your time.",

I came here for brunch that celebrated classic boy bands and DJ Corleone really had the place packed on a rainy Sunday! I ordered the \"Oh shit, I forgot my wallet in the car\" which was EXCELLENT, especially the tater tots! Loved the name of it hahaha. Definitely recommend!!",

    "text": "I've been coming here since they opened but probably will not be back until thy get some competent chefs and managers.  Sat outside as a party of 2, waitress brought no waters - the entire time- so we ordered to go.  Very complicated order of two salads with chicken on top.  While we waited I ordered a beer, about 10 minutes later the waitress brought out half of our order and said sorry we are out of chicken, she had no answer when I asked why she didn't tell us earlier.  So I ordered just the walnut salad and asked for a free beer because of the wait \"I have to ask my manager\" was the response.  I went and asked for her.  Then the other salad finally arrived - another 10 minutes later - we left.  We got home to find 2 boxes of greens- no chicken, dumped in salad dressing with no other vegetables but topped with old bacon.    This was the Wednesday August 29th.  My experience is that come football season all they care about is Sunday's, they make a boat load of cash and probably makes most of their year.   Every other day suffers - and now they are closed on Monday's for the first time since opening.  A good restaurant/bar can usually handle 7 days a week because they have good food.",

They offered some great options. I went with the chorizo breakfast tacos. They came three to an order and was more than enough to satisfy my hunger. I would recommend the brussel sprouts. They are crispy, served in an iron skillet, and have the perfect combo of sweet and savory.  This place also has what the Charlotte brunch scene is lacking, great mimosa specials. $2 for a single, $4 for a double, and $15 for a bottle of champs. You can't beat it. Highly recommend!",

The game is tomorrow at 8 and our reservation was for 2 people at 4. I got a call from the restaurant about 15 minutes ago (about 20 hours prior to the reserved time) telling me that Draught is under new ownership and they are not honoring our reservation.

Severely under staffed and the kitchen must be in shambles for how much they messed up. I thought I was gonna be late arriving about 30 minutes after everyone else but they took the order shortly after I arrived. I feel bad for everyone who sat there waiting that long. Most of us had to be out of there by noon and we were still getting food brought out at noon. Myself and others didn't receive any food and the waitress didn't know why so we just said forget it. She said someone left without paying and looked like she was gonna loose her job over it with her reaction but many people had the wrong things on their tickets so I'm assuming either they put in an extra entree for someone or they never received it and just left.   All and all I enjoyed my street festival food I got as I rushed down the street 30 minutes late to the parade float I had to be on.  I hardly leave negative reviews but the owner and management of this company need a serious sit down to figure out how to improve the business. There are too many reviews that are just like this and I hate seeing a good space ran so poorly.",

They have a make your own mimosa bar with all the fixens. You basically purchase the bottle of champagne and make your drink from the bar fixens (I.e orange, cranberry, fruit, etc). I typically brunch with my friends every other week and we like the energy of Draught but their choice of champagne leaves much to be desired believe it's called Don \"something\" . Anyway their food is a bit bland (I.e Chicken Waffles, Shrimp/Grits). Both are presented/cooked well but could be seasoned more.   I've been here a few times and each time it seems like their either under staffed or have their waitresses stretched between big and small tables which causes both tables to wait.   Now the music is always great and the DJ plays a variety of music that keeps the scene live and vibrant.  Overall this is a great spot and I would recommend to anyone. We'll still come back but I tend to order beer only.",

Unfortunately, this is most outstanding quality about it.   The draft/craft beer selection is decent, but if you frequent Charlotte breweries, it's nothing new.   As far as the food goes, everything is pretty decent, but the variety is the issue. There is extremely little for dietary needs like vegetarian or gluten-free. I eat pescetarian, so I've had the salmon burger each time I've gone and it has good flavor, but does fall apart as you try to eat it. At least the fries are very good and well seasoned!   On my last visit, I came with a group of 5 people around noon on a Saturday. The place was full, but not over-packed and they were able to accommodate us with a 4-top and pulling up a chair. However, the service was awful because I think they had one bartender, one cook, one waitress, and one hostess. For a Saturday brunch, they were extremely under-prepared. It took forever to get water, let alone 5 of them, and refills. Our food was partially given to another table and then came out at all different times. The worst of it was that no apologies were made whatsoever.  Out of all the sports bars with craft beer in Charlotte, I think I might pick another one next time :/",

The waitress let us know about an option they gave you where u can get a whole bottle of champagne and you can make your own! The price of the bottle was 15. Or you could order mimosas for $4 a piece. It only made sense logically to get the bottle. That is a very popular option because we saw a lot of tables that had bottles as well. There was a table near the door with various fruit and juices to make the mimosa of your choice. It also has olives and tobasco sauces, etc so I'm pretty sure there was an option for creating your own bloody Mary's as well. The food was good. I got the shrimp and grits. My friend got the chicken and waffle. The shrimp and grits had sausage, peppers, onion and a garlic sauce. It was very tasty. I would consider it more of a lunch/dinner type meal. You also have the option to make reservations there. There were a few empty tables when we got there, but they were reserved so we had a small wait. I don't think our wait was more than 10 mins.  Overall good food, good drinks, good place!",

Located right outside the stadium, this is a perfect spot to pre game or go after the game. It has two levels, so even though it gets crowded, there is usually still plenty of room. You may not always get a table, but plenty of standing room. You will likely find yourself standing anyways because of the excitement.   Sundays they do $12 bottles of Champagne on away games. They then put out juices to allow you to make your own mimosas. Best deal in town for sure. They also have Panther's shots that are bright blue and fun to take with friends.  Food is your typical bar food, but is quite good. We love the pretzel and the nachos are also good.  Always a solid spot to watch sports. We will be back.",

I would order the turkey burger (bunless, duh), plus a side of collards and a side of broccoli.  They didn't always serve the lunch menu on the weekends, and it was like hit or miss if I was able to even curb my craving.  Well, there's new ownership as of late, and I was hoping for a similar menu, and it wasn't really an option, but they changed the turkey burger.  Also, they barely had any broccoli when we went last time and it was like they put 2 tablespoons of broccoli on my plate, apologized for not having it (after the food came out, they failed to tell me even before), and it was just disappointing.  The service here used to be just OKAY. But it has really gone down hill. We were nearly the only people at high tops the other week, there was a larger party in the back of about 8 people, but it took 3 asks to get the check.  I used to like it, but it's a hard-pass here on out.",

It's a small place so they don't always have a lot of staff working which causes a delay sometimes when it gets busy. But other than that I would recommend it. The bar room is very cool looking and you can tell a lot of thought went into it, they have a really nice outside patio is well. Two of my favorite things there are, number one, the nachos. They are very different but are really good and worth a try. Also their brunch specials and Mamosa and bloody Mary bar is something to note!   I need to update this because we went again on a Sunday for brunch and it was a disaster! All the food was wrong and came out at different times.  And the food that did come out was okay at best.  They need to get it together!!!",

A friend is always telling me about this place and it's brunch so it was the first that came to mind when we needed a last min restaurant.   Pros- they have a DJ, beautiful outside area with heaters if it's too cold outside, you can bring your dog with you, brunch lasts til 4pm, and they have a good mimosa deal with different flavors(I believe it was OJ, cranberry, and blueberry when we went). If you like spice, they have a hot sauce bar with different flavors at different heat levels   Cons- they don't give that much food at all. Although, we did want to go their simply to have food and enjoy each other's company we were definitely all still starving and maybe just a little hungry when we left too. When we were seated, the server already let us know the kitchen was out of a lot of stuff, which forced me to order the grassroots omelette and fries. My bf ordered the shrimp and grits with pimento cheese and okra (weird recipe if you ask me). It's kind of loud so you will be yelling at friends across the table. You actually make your own mimosa too (could be a pro or con depending on who you're asking)  I would probably try this place again and come a little earlier to see if my experience would change but not my fav brunch i still love Brazwells and Vivace.",

Our favorite item at Draught was the French toast chicken sandwich with breakfast potatoes. There wasn't one thing on the menu that seemed like it was consistent with the last, but more that this menu was just all over the place. Wings, blue waffles and chicken tenders, burgers and a few breakfast plates. This is not brunch. So we suffered through our brunch and I will note that the pimento cheese grits were good (but they were a try only because they ran out of tater tots). The sweetest deal was the mimosa bottle special. Outside of eating prior and stopping by for mimosas, I doubt I'll be back with this menu.",

Decided to sit at the bar after waiting and not being offered any indication on where to sit. We originally came for brunch after reading reviews on their brunch and the mimosa/bloody bar. Upon sitting down we were informed they don't do the mimosa/bloody bar during football season (understandable). I then ask for their breakfast/brunch menu and get the same response...ok. Maybe advertise this on your website then. We settled for some mimosas (which were good) and an appetizer. Buffalo chicken dip appetizer took almost an hour to arrive, bartender was apologetic, however NOT worth it. Tasted like canned chicken with Tostitos chips. Hopefully this is an off day for them but I was definitely disappointed and hoping to find a new brunch or \"Sunday football\" spot. During my time I mentioned to my fiance that this place should be submitted to bar rescue because they have potential but it's absolutely not there.

On top of all of this, they were out of sweet potato fries which was one of my biggest sellers for coming.   Giving it 3/5 (would give 2.5/5) because they do have a really good beer selection and the service was good but the food is terrible. They just need to make the kitchen into an office and they'll be set.",

    "text": "I loved this place! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food!!   First order of business...drinks. They had 4$ mimosas, I'll take 5, just keep em coming! I always know I'm going to have a good dining experience when there are actual drink specials, not just your typical 3$ bud and bud lights. They had a few others as well that my boyfriend and friends took advantage of.   We ordered the house nachos to start, OMG they were amazing. So different compared to normal nachos, these were made with in house made chips, creamy cheese, some sort of sweet/tangy BBQ sauce I believe and then all the good add ons. We could not get them in our mouths fast enough! I'll go back to Draught just to get the nachos again.   I got the buffalo chicken tacos....they were fantastic. I mean you can never go wrong with buffalo anything. If I could eat buffalo style for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I totally would and would be proud of it!   I can't wait to go back to Draught soon, especially once football season starts again and for Brunch on Sundays (mimosa and bloody mary bar!!!!)",

    "text": "Despite the negative reviews, most of which seemed to concern service, I set out this week for dinner and a couple of beers. It was the proximity to my hotel, and the draft list which were the deciding factors.    We were immediately greeted at the entrance and then nicely asked to self-seat ourselves. Just as quickly, we were presented menus and a draft list. Very soon thereafter, a very friendly server offered to take our drink order. My dining partner was offered a sample of a beer upon the recommendation of the server, which he ended up ordering, eventually twice.   Unfortunately, all went downhill from this point. I ordered an appetizer and our entrees shortly thereafter. We waited for close to 25 minutes before our entrees were delivered to our table, never having seen my appetizer.  The chicken sandwich I ordered was prepared with little care. The breast was very dry and covered about only 60% of the surface area of the bun. The sauce that was supposed to be served on the sandwich was literally (actually literally, not as in teenage speak) a small tablespoon-worth confined to one small quarter-sized spot on the bottom bun. I sense that the sandwich was prepared either in great haste or with very little care. My side of pimiento grits, served in its own small cast iron skillet, was barely lukewarm by the time it arrived at my table.  Our server was very apologetic when I mentioned that my appetizer never made an appearance. As the restaurant traffic increased, we saw less and less of her. Although there was one other server, I got the sense, from a brief conversation with him, that he was very new.  Our server was definitely busting her butt to tend to all of the tables, both inside and out (which was hot and humid), while managing to maintain a great attitude and smile. So I don't fault her for the slow service, I can only assume that the ownership hasn't been able, or is unwilling, to properly staff the restaurant. I'm assuming that the same understaffing woes affected the quality of the food prep.  The decor is very comfortable and clean.  On our visit, there was a live musician playing covers. It wasn't loud, she was talented, and it provided a nice background.  I have another visit to Charlotte upcoming. Draught's beer list and its proximity to my hotel may bring me back to try something other than the chicken sandwich and perhaps the Brussels Sprouts that never arrived. If I do, and if the quality improves, I will certainly amend my review, but for now, the negative reviews seem to be deserved.",

    "text": "This place is so inconsistent. There's always a problem when I go there. Usually they are \"out of\" something on the menu or it takes forever to get your food. My last attempt at draught consisted of me making a reservation for 6 people on Sunday for brunch. My whole party arrived on time to find out our reservation was given to someone else who said my name to the hostess. Kinda strange since I had no idea who they were. Instead of the manager  confronting the guests who stole my reservation, we waited for 45 MINUTES for another table to open up. I was very mad. They \"compensated\" with one bottle of cheap $20  champagne that barely filled the 6 glasses.   It took another 20 minutes for a waitress to take our orders followed by another 20 minutes to bring another bottle of champagne that was ordered when our food was ordered.  The last straw was when 2 people received their food while the other 4 of us watched them eat for 15 minutes before the waitress informed us our ticket was \"lost'. At this point we got up and walked out.   This place needs better management and more staff especially on a busy Sunday brunch. They are severely understaffed and lack communication between the servers, kitchen, and bar. Every time I go here I hope it will be better. Third time is NOT a charm!",

Our food was given to another table, and my salmon burger, though delicious, showed up a solid 20 minutes after everyone else was served because it had to be remade. It was tasty, but it would have been nice if our server at least recognized the inconvenience and/or provided some sort of discount. Of course, this didn't happen.Thank goodness for the mimosa bar - our afternoon's saving grace.   If you're looking for a local place to grab some drinks and watch football, Draught provides the right atmosphere -- decent size patio, additional space roped off for more standing room on a Panthers game day, and plenty of TVs in and out to watch your team. For brunch/lunch with a group of friends, though, you're better off somewhere else.",

Then, they got busy and couldn't handle it at all...went back for a second order of wings...45 minutes later, no wings so I had to stalk my server and tell her to just take them off and get me a check...that was 10 mins ago, still waiting on the check ...ugh",

We used to drive by the old Hartigan's and pray that they turned it into something better and that's exactly what they've done. The whole bar has a rustic feel as it's covered in wood and sparingly decorated (in a good way!) They have a decent craft beer list, although they could stand to offer more (better) local draughts.   The food was incredible! We got the avocado salsa which is served with house made kettle chips. We also ordered the egg rolls which change each week. They were \"Cuban\" egg rolls and were to die for. I ordered the scallop salad which was absolutely delicious and made sure not to douse it in salad so I could bring the rest home with me (which I never do!)  The staff was really friendly and attentive. We were that annoying table that isn't ever ready to order and our server stayed patient and friendly the whole time. The manager checked in on us and made sure everyone was happy. They also have a really cool giant glass garage door that they opened up once it started to get busy inside. It really changed the atmosphere in an awesome way and brought the outside in! We got there around 6:30 but it didn't start to get busy until 8 or so.   We are so excited about this place as we're moving into the neighborhood in December and can't wait to become regulars! Highly recommended!",

What's awful about this place is the service and the lack of general knowledge of how to serve customers. I attended a luncheon downstairs on March 9th. The person serving drinks acted like it was an inconvenience and while announcements were made she continually walked in and out while consistently slamming the door. When they ran out of salad at a buffet she told a person \"that's all you get\". He got his $15 back which was nice (I guess) but why even say that to someone? I then went upstairs at 1:15 to watch the ACC Tourney and sat at a high-top near the bar. Not once did a server come by. We repeatedly had to go to the bar for beer even though the bartender walked by us every few mins to check on other tables. It really was comical and showed us the poor service downstairs extended upstairs and wasn't just one person.",

I enjoy the fact that it's an easy walk down the Draught Path (my name for the recently paved path leading to Draught from Wesley Heights) and it's really the most accessible sports bar to get to on foot.   While i love the Monday night special of $3 beers, they have nothing for vegans to eat aside from fries and the avacado salsa which is just chunks of avacado, tomato, onions and jalapeno with chips. Not bad, but not enough for a meal, so we always have to eat elsewhere before going here for drinks. Unfortunately their veggie burger has egg. Not that i expect every place to have vegan options, but the two times we have brought others here who did eat full meals, they were not returning for food. I even took a picture of their disappointing meal, but will have to go through old pics to track it down. The servers have always been friendly and they have a pretty nice space and little patio and even a downstairs with more tvs and another bar and a bigger bathroom (that I didn't know existed until my 3rd visit). I'll definitely keep coming here for the beer (although it doesn't seem to rotate too much) and if for no other reason, our US men's and women's soccer teams are a combined 3-0 so far watching from Draught.",

Our waitress was slow on the service and pretty sure it took her 10 mins to refill our coffees. And then I took a bite into the biscuits and gravy and unfortunately, they were plain with no flavor. :( The biscuits were flat and not fluffy. In fact, all the food we got was not hot at all. The only plus side to this place is the cool environment and they have a DJ that plays music during Sunday brunch. That's all folks",

Not to mention the place is way over priced for what you are getting. $12 for a salad from a bar is ridiculous. I give it two stars because the food has been tasty, just over priced for a bar.",

Grilled wings are a treat in the many different flavors offered, as is the beer cheese.   However, burgers and pulled pork sandwiches were both disappointing. Burgers were overcooked and unseasoned, while the pork was bland and so wet that it soaked through the bun.  Overall, good place to drink, but the food menu is hit or miss.",

I love the relaxed  and rustic decor of wood and metal. The have a garage door opening to the patio which I picture to be packed in the fall on Sundays. For what it's worth, we visited at 3:30 on the Sunday of Labor Day so I'm sure the D Squad was working serving detail. However, there was a total of 4 severs and 11 people including us. That's PEOPLE,  not tables.  We were seated and several severs walked past us without acknowledgement. Pet Peeve - just cuz you're not our server, would it be that hard to say that your server will be right with you? Anyway, we waited a good 8-10 minutes before she came by for our drink order.  I got the grilled flatbread with pulled pork.  Slightly sweet and crisp. I would order it again. Huz had the Tequila Shrimp Bowl full of large grilled shrimp, corn and rice. He said it was great and polished it off.  We waited another 10 minutes with empty drinks before our server came back.  Finally just got our check and left.   All in all, a great new addition to the casual bar scene.  I will be back and update my review.   Hopefully they work out the service kinks soon.",

They have a ton of brand new tvs on every inch of the walls and are able to change the sound for the area you are seated in. I am a bit bias, as it houses the Michigan State Alumni Club of Charlotte - Go Green! They even have some Michigan brews on tap too. This place is also the official game watch for Clemson and Miami.   Best Tip about this place: there is a back entrance on the lower side to the downstairs bar, plus it has a HUGE projector screen downstairs too!!",

She did however ask if we wanted to \"Tap out on those nachos\" AND if I was going to \"crush\" the rest of my taco.  The food was mediocre. The pulled pork on the nachos was cold and my duck tacos were flavorless.  I'm sure there are better options and I will be looking for them the next time I visit Charlotte.",

He stated my friend broke the toilet and it happens all the time and he had to pay him in order to leave. Whether he did or did not do it, which I'm pretty sure he didn't, I don't see how under any circumstances, being violent solves anything. There were 15 of us just standing there in awe of what was happening and who knows how far he would have taken I if some of us hadn't intervened. Maybe they need to rethink some of their staff.

Having heard great things about Draught brunch, I was excited to try it this morning - especially the mimosa and Bloody Mary bars. After checking online to see when they opened (11 am), my fiance and I showed up at 11:15 to meet some friends, who drove down from the Northlake area. After walking up to the restaurant, we were informed by an employee sweeping outside that they were pushing brunch back an hour to 12 since they had been really busy the night before with the crowd from the ACC championship. A little annoying, but we decided to just kill some time in uptown for 30 minutes and head back. At 12, we wandered back over, hungry and ready for those mimosas, only to be told by another employee that they were now pushing brunch back to 1 pm to continue cleanup. At this point, we gave up and left to try and find another brunch spot. I understand being swamped and having to delay brunch, but there was absolutely no update on Facebook or social media to warn customers of the delay. And then to tell us 12 pm and not be ready at that time is unacceptable. Will probably give their brunch another try but will definitely be calling ahead next time to check if they are actually open.",

I go here often and love the bar seating, and they always have something going on. The service can be so so,  sometimes it takes no time to get a waitress sometimes it takes 20 minutes.

    "text": "Came here with a party of 8 to watch college football last Friday night. About an hour into our stay, we were 1 of maybe 4 tables with people on the main floor. The service was horrendous. Basically, our server would maybe check on us every half hour, usually only if we waived her down, and would only ask half of the table if they wanted more drinks, food, etc., before running away. I would have understood if the place was packed but there were literally 4 tables full. Had we gotten even some semblance of service we definitely would've spent a lot more money and had a way better time. Sucks because this was going to be our go-to bar for the college football season. Not anymore.",

I catch the attention of someone else behind the bar who seems like a bar back and ask him for a food menu he looks at the bartender (same one  who vanished the fist time) and the bartender says sorry kitchen is closed it closed at 10.

    "text": "I like this place and I have a feeling I'm going to REALLY like it in months to come. I made it to the soft opening today and while it's clear there are a few kinks to work out, as any new restaurant opening may have, I think they will have them easily under control.   To start, the atmosphere is great. They gutted Hartigans, took out the booths, added a great see through garage door (like Nan and Byrons) that will open up to outdoor seating, dazzled up the bar, redid all the wooding on the walls. It feels a lot more spacious and has a nice casual, but not too casual, vibe about it. Basically, for game days, this place will be on point. (They will have a special game day menu that I am interested to check out).  Now the menu and food! I am a fan. Their Apps are definitely the star dishes. For apps we tried the Chicken Wings in OMB Copper Buffalo and Barbalo sauce, the Pork Wings, and the Smoked Duck Tacos. Not a single thing disappointed. The wings were great, I really enjoyed the OMB Copper sauce. The Smoked Duck Tacos were very good too - the house plum bbq sauce definitely has a kick to it but it really complimented the duck. The pork wings were fantastic (Beer Braised Pork Shanks Tossed in a Sweet Chili Cheer Wine BBQ Sauce, yes, please, two times) they are pretty big and pretty delicious.   For our meals, what I remember is the Chipotle Avocado Chicken Sandwich, Smoked Bacon Chicken Caesar Melt, Korean Bulgogi Lettuce Wraps, and a Flank Steak Sandwich (also sweet potato fries and house chips). Everything looked great, I had the Flank steak sandwich and I enjoyed it - a little too bready but I thought the amount of food was filling and tasted great. The person who had the lettuce wraps, which has flank steak in it too, thought it was a little salty but overall a great dish.   All in all, the food was interesting in a good way; I was impressed not to see a standard menu, by any means. There are a lot of great looking things that I want to try (like the Smoked Duck French Dip and the T.E.D. Sandwich - 'Turkey Every Day,' i think thats what it stood for.)  We unfortunately didn't get to see their beer list, so I am also very interested to see that when its finally open (They will also have liquor, I believe). Given that they were still doing construction today and that it was there soft opening, you expect a few kinks. the food took quite a while to come out but I imagine that that is something that will be smoothed over in a short amount of time. The service was great though - heavily staffed, really polite waitresses. (She offered a song and dance while we waited, I mean, c'mon, that's great stuff!)  Maybe small edits once they're open but this place has GREAT potential and it looks like it will reach it. I know that once its fully up and functional that I will probably be back frequently!",

I wish the cheese on nachos had come out hot but I understand they were probably timing multiple meals to hit the table at the same time.

We snagged parking in the parking lot and there are several other lots around. The food is elevated bar food and the service was really nice.   In the warm months this would be a nice patio for some serious sports and people watching.  Fav menu item? duck tacos. Bonus- 20% off for checking in on Yelp!",

    "text": "Attended the media event for the launch of Draught. Really impressed with the venue, staff, and menu.   I'd only driven past the old location which was easily missed. Now you can't miss the giant lettering and awesome signage they have outside. The giant garage door basically says 'You should hang out here' because ti's going to be a fun place.   Inside has an awesome mix of vintage looking wood, pipes, and edison bulbs. Even the floors caught my eye and complete the vintage, yet cool look.   Their beer list is a mix of craft and domestic which I'd usually frown upon(missing my OMB Copper). Though I know they are aiming hard at the tailgate crowd so I'll let the lack of unique craft beers slide.. for now.   The food is upscale southern with a few randoms tossed in. My table ordered the deviled eggs and duck tacos for apps - both quite good. I had the meat loaf for an entree and really enjoyed it. The mashed potatoes in particular were amazing. Tasted a little bit of everyone's food at the table. There was no loser.. I'll be back to order different things for sure.   After dinner we got a tour of the entire place including the bonus downstairs which I didn't even know existed. Downstairs is going to be a blast during the tailgate/game time. Really looking forward to a crowded Panthers Sunday soon!  Overall I'm happy for an alternative to upscale in uptown. Don't get me wrong - I love all the bars we have on 5th street right now, but this place just has more of a pub feel. Something we really lack within the 277 loop.",

Lots of flat screen televisions, all set to sports channels.   We were seated promptly and the waitress was quick to refill our drinks.    I had the short rib sandwich with fries, $12.   It normally comes with \"beer cheese,\" but I asked they leave it off.  I have no idea what beer cheese is - and neither did the waitress.  The bread was an oblong hoagie type loaf  with fatty square cuts of beef.  There was lots of meat, about the equivalent of two decks of cards.  The sandwich also had grilled onions.  The beef was very tender, but a bit tasteless.   The bread was worse.  I asked for some steak sauce and ate the beef with a fork and left the bread behind.  The fries were a bit soggy and they came with seasoned salt.  My friend had the meatloaf sandwich, $11.     The  waitress said it was a local favorite.   His bread looked to be of a much better quality than mine.  He said the meatloaf was good, but not great.     If you are looking for craft beers (over 40) or an upscale bar to watch the game, this may be a good choice.  But eat lunch elsewhere.",

Downstairs is usually reserved for larger groups, tailgates, late nights and football. They have a decent beer list (30 or so) but for a place called draught you'd think they'd have a few more options on tap.  Decently sized menu - everything from more standard pub pub favorites like burgers, sandwiches, flatbreads, and wings but also a few curveballs such as shrimp rice bowl, duck tacos, and lettuce wraps.  Good place for lunch, happy hour or football.",
