    "text": "This is the place to quick for a solid Vietnamese hit on your tastebuds. As I have been to Vietnam a few times before, I had to visit Pho Hoa to satisfy my crave. It had such a familiar taste to it that we went to Pho Hoa twice in our one week visit in Charlotte! We tried the Vermicelli bowls with spring rolls & grilled pork and, the Pho noodle soup with the tripe, fatty flank, flank and beef balls. The broth was full of beefy goodness and was fairly generous with the amount of meat. The vietnamese coffee was a little too sweet so I suggest not to mix in all the condense milk given but the coffee definitely did have that Vietnamese brew to it. The set up is casual and the service is simple, quirky and good.   **To all the homesick asians out there, this is a pretty good joint for you. Plus there's a well stocked asian grocer right round the corner.",

For those with a more milder palate,like myself, they still have very delicious milder flavors to add to your pho.  The service was excellent and they really have delicious tea beverages, which seemed more like milkshakes. Nevertheless they have tapioca with all sorts of different flavors. Definitely would recommend this restaurant to friends",

Whatever flavor you choose, it's guaranteed to be delicious. They also have other flavors that is not on the bubble tea menu so be sure to ask. They offer tapioca pearls or jelly. Flavors can be mixed up. My favorite currently is coconut mixed with pineapple to create a pina colada flavor. :)  Papaya salad is perfect Laos recipe. It contains crushed peanuts so make sure to request none if you have allergies. It also contains crab paste. Great choices of appetizers as well as an excellent vegetarian menu!   Ever since moving up to Charlotte about 5 yrs ago. I've came here as well as tried other pho locations around Charlotte and the triad area but none can compare. My husband, daughters and I are somewhat usuals here and that's because their food are always good.   They seem to be the main place out of a certain few that will cater to your taste buds. However you like your pho, let them know. My husband current obsession is his usual pho ga with a side of bun bo hue broth. Strange. Perhaps but Pho Hoa is able to provide that preference while other joints scratch their heads and tell him it isn't possible.    They treat you like family and are always welcoming you in with a smile.   Do give them a try if you have never been. It will make you change your favorite pho/bubble tea place for sure. :)",

That being said, Pho Hoa does a good job compared to other pho places that I have been to. The service is friendly and quick, and the food tastes good. If you like pho, you will like Pho Hoa. Not sure what else to say since it really is just soup with noodles and meat.  One complaint that I have and the reason for four stars is that they have a minimum charge required for credit card use that they conveniently put just above the price of one order of pho. Stop being cheap and greedy, and start accepting credit cards for all charges.",

The take out service was friendly and casual. We ordered the #2 ($11 for large) steak and brisket pho and the #30 summer rolls (4.25 for 2 pcs). The pho comes separated from the noodles and you throw together everything when you get home. The summer rolls were pretty good, although I've had better (they were lacking mint/basil). The pho was awesome!!! Rich flavor and fresh meat and toppings. The large pho split into two large bowls at home, if you've got a normal appetite you could definitely split it. Overall great place and will be my go to spot this winter!",

Take my word for it, this has to be the best place to get Pho. Honestly, it is very hard to serve rich in flavor pho at a restaurant because the general nature of the dish takes so long to make. For me, nothing beats homemade pho, but I have been here since I was a kid and I love it. You will know when there is a not so good bowl of pho, the broth would not be rich in flavor and you will be able to taste \"water\". Their menu has stayed the same since I first came here as a child and there are many wonderful options to get. Hu Tieu Xao (stir fry) and any of the Com Tam (broken rice) dishes are phenomenal. The sauce is the most important part and they manage to hit it every time.   The place could be a little cleaner(reason for 4 stars), but the preservation of the restaurant decor and everything else has been the same for many many years. The family who owns this restaurant is extremely nice and welcoming and my review is not in any way biased because my family knows them. The food comes out fast and I have not had one bad experience. I have yet to find any other Pho restaurant who can manage to bring a good degree of richness to their broth... so check it out!",

I ordered their Bun Bo Hue and it was absolutely incredible! Not sure if it's consistently like that since I'm not from the area, but mine was awesome. It didn't have pork thigh but still, very happy! Garnishing was among the freshest I've seen outside of home cooking.   Pho was \"okay\" but Pho is one of those things that no matter how you made it, some will love it, some will not. Can't please everybody because everybody's got their own definition of a perfect pho. With that said, the garnishing for their Pho was top notch as well!   Their service was good, though a tad bit slow. It was almost 10 minutes until our order was taken. In certain restaurant, 10 minutes is nothing. But Vietnamese restaurants of this nature, 10 minutes is a long time. Wasn't just us.. I sat and observed other patrons that went though the same thing... sat around with the menus closed just looking around passing time waiting to be waited on... and they weren't even busy (this was late afternoon, so normal for a restaurant not to be busy).   Regardless, I think it's a solid place, and I will definitely come here again when I'm in the area.",

    "text": "What the pho?  No seriously...  How does this place have 4.5 stars?!?!  I can ask this because I'm Vietnamese.  I grew up eating authentic Vietnamese cuisine not only at home but at restaurants in Little Saigon in Orange County, CA -- where there is a heavy concentration of mouth-watering, satiating, authentic Vietnamese cuisine.  Oh, and I've had pho in Viet Nam in both Saigon and Hanoi as recently as a year ago.  Pho is my comfort food; you know, the food you grew up eating that just made your tummy feel safe and happy.  I dragged my boyfriend out of our warm home in the rain so that I could enjoy a nice, delicious, hot bowl of pho, my quintissential rainy-day food.  I got a hot bowl of pho alright, but it was NOT delicious.  Pho broth, done well, is very complex to make (which is why I completely shy away from the kitchen altogether) because it takes all day to marinate the bones and then add the subsequent layers of flavors to it (there's anise and other flavors).  So 3 stars, and honestly, I think that's a really generous rating for the experience I had given their: (1) unclean restaurant (2 stars); good service service (3.5 stars); canned pho broth (2 stars); extensive menu (3.5 stars).  Unclean restaurant.  Ok; so pho is kind of like good authentic Mexican food.  You know the place is good when you're going to a little hole in the wall.  However, hole in the wall doesn't have to mean unclean.  When we came on a Sunday evening, the restaurant wasn't very busy.  However, there were food and remnants of who knows what on the floor.  It is quite bewildering that the restaurant has a 97% or some very high cleanliness rating.  The servers were standing around so it wouldn't have killed them to pick up a broom.  Just saying...  It just makes a bad impression and is really unappetizing, in general.    Good service.  The servers were very attentive, prompt and friendly.  They are obviously accustomed to explaining the menu, which is broken down like a \"Vietnamese cuisine for dummies.\"  If you're a newbie, they really know how to ease in slowly to pop your Vietnamese food cherry.    Extensive menu.  They have an extensive menu, kind of like Cheesecake Factory but for Vietnamese cuisine.  I'm certain that there's a dish for everyone's palate, with the caveat that it's prepared correctly.  I didn't try anything other than the pho so I can't speak to the other dishes.  They have a pho for beginner's section where they break down each ingredient and you can add whatever you want.  Basically, all pho restaurants do this, but it's not spelled out in such a rudimentary way.    The best analogy I can give is if someone has never had a burger before, you're not going to give them a Western Bacon Cheeseburger or quarter pounder with chili cheese on it; you're going to give them a bun, a patty, some pickles, ketchup and mustard to ease them into it.  You can go to ANY burger joint and ask them to hold the onions or add extra pickles; they just don't lay all of the ingredients out like at Five Guys for you to pick and choose.  Pho Hoa is like Five Guys but like all burger joints who let you pick and choose your ingredients, all pho restaurants do the same.    If you're new, just try the chicken pho (I prefer the beef broth though) or the pho thai (which is just rare flank steak lightly cooked by the heat of the broth).  All my non-Vietnamese friends ease into pho by trying these basics (chicken pho or pho thai) and then slowly trying new ingredients.  Canned pho.  The pho I was served was completely lacking in the complexity I was speaking of earlier.  It tasted like a step up from Top Ramen, although Top Ramen is more flavorful.  The broth I got was very bland to the extent that I needed to add fish sauce to it just to give it a little more flavor.  It tasted like beef broth from a can -- you know how chicken broth tastes like straight from the can.  When I have to add fish sauce to my pho, that's an epic pho fail.    I did have the honeydew smoothie though; it was delicious.    Overall, I left feeling really disappointed in my first pho experience in Charlotte.  Yelp, you have failed me on this front.  Total bummer.  I definitely won't be returning and next time it rains, I'll have to drive farther to satiate my pho craving.",

Has delicious gluten free options  Pho Hoa meets both needs with spectacular fashion. I'll shamelessly admit that we have literally eaten here 3 Fridays in a row. It's hard to beat the friendly and fast service, high quality food, and low price point.  Lately we've been letting the staff pick our meals for us. We tell them the kind of thing we are (or aren't) in the mood for, and they always bring out something spectacular. We also have been going often enough that they let us taste test the new dishes they're trying out for themselves. You really get the feeling that this is a family restaurant, and they're happy to welcome in smiling regulars as part of the family.",

And this is the closest place to my house to get my fix.  Pho Hoa Restaurant is a chain with dozens of restaurants around the world. I'll agree with Ben N. though, the store here in Charlotte has the feel of a mom-and-pop type pho place. My pho order is the exact same at every noodle place: meatballs as my only protein. Tripe, tendon, and all that jazz are just not my jam. I think the broth has great flavor here. The fresh rolls and fried spring rolls are both good. Bonus: they also have bomb ass bubble tea.  Two phos, an order of fresh rolls, an order of fried spring rolls, and two Cokes totaled up to be $32.45. Note: sodas come in cans, so if you're a refill kind of person... you have been warned. Service is always pretty prompt. I do a lot of take out orders and I'm always in and out quickly.  Is it the best in Charlotte? I'm not answering that question. I'll let you guys continue your debate over who wins in our pho scene.",

They asked if I minded if it had meat broth, and I said I didn't since I'm not that strict. They were very accommodating and served me a bowl full of noodles and veggies. It was enough soup for 2 meals.  Service was a bit slow because there were only 3 workers and a ton of take-out orders, so it took a pretty long while to get our check.

    "text": "Being Vietnamese, I hate to write a bad review for one of my own but my experience with this restaurant was just ridiculous. I was visiting some friends in Charlotte a couple weeks ago and was craving pho so they recommended this place. I stopped by and ordered it to go. When one of the employees brought my food out, I specifically asked if there was Sriracha sauce and he adamantly assured me that there was. Ok, thanks! I bring my food back and open the container - no sriracha sauce. Alright, that's ok I can improvise with some Texas Pete I found in my friend's fridge. Next, I find that the broth was cold. This place was only a 4 minute drive from my friend's place so I know it didn't magically freeze from the arctic 80 degree weather. Yes, nobody likes finding their food cold but it's extremely important for pho broth to be as hot as possible when served because THE BEEF IS SERVED RAW (the hot broth is supposed to cook it and for take out, the beef is packed raw next to the noodles, not in the broth). Cold broth, raw meat - this was not the convenient take out I had in mind. So I had to apologetically rummage through my friend's kitchen and reboil my broth. When my food was finally ready, I sat down and took out the chopsticks they had provided. Oh what do you know? To complete this wonderful experience, there was dust and mold all over the chopsticks. Fluke? They gave me 4 pairs and as I pulled them out pair after pair - all dust and mold. I still feel nauseous thinking about them.",

I haven't tried much other than the pho, but I had part of a noodle and pork dish(I believe its number 30 or 32 on the menu) and the pork was delicious- seasoned well, cooked well, and flavorful. The rest of the dish, which mostly consisted of noodles and a few veggies, was a little dry. I tried some bubble tea here my first visit, and I have to say that the green apple flavor is one to avoid. It's thick, and tastes far too strong and artificial. It gave me the impression that they used way too much of the mix for making the drink and not enough water. When I poured a little water in it it was much more bearable, but even after that the flavor was just okay. However, a friend tried the soursop and thought it was very delicious. The pearls were not quite as sweet as I like them, but I think I prefer them sweeter than most people. Never really had any trouble with service, I found it a little slow my last trip, but otherwise they're very nice. Overall this is a great place and I will continue to visit!

The broth has a more interesting flavor, and my perception, at least lately, has been that the quality of meat used in the pho is better.  Pho Hoa is a franchise chain, but each one is a little different and this one seems to have a few specials and items that are not part of the standard franchise menu.  Their menu is no more unusual than any other Charlotte Vietnamese restaurant, but they do it right and they open at 9:00 a.m. so that you can have pho for breakfast traditional stylee.",

If you haven't had the best, then you may not be able to tell the difference.  The most important thing in a good pho is the broth.  The broth is the hardest and takes the longest to make.  The broth holds all the flavor; it makes or breaks the pho.  The rest are just additions to the bowl of broth.  Here, I don't know if it's because the broth is too watered down, or if the spices are off, but the broth is just not satisfying.  A good pho broth is made from boiling beef bones with plenty of marrow for hours with spices like cloves and star anise.  Pho is supposed to be a hearty meal in which the combination of protein, spices, and warmth  puts you into a slight narcotic trance. It calms your nerves and makes you want to chill the rest of the day. It is the ultimate comfort food.  However, the beef pho at this restaurant was not hearty enough and certainly did not hit the spot.",

I don't have Pho often but I'm going to make it a staple in my diet during the upcoming colder months. Everything Pho Hoa serves up is extremely delicious. The seasoning and flavor is on point. The portions are huge. A large bowl is easily 2 servings. Service is super friendly and the cashier and I shared some witty banter. He put extra effort to make sure I was engaged and welcomed. Prices are affordable, especially since you'll definitely have left overs. I love that I was able to pile on stuff to my bowl and added pretty much all the meats available. I came in and ordered take out and was on my way pretty quickly with a well packed bag of soupy goodness. I would definitely recommend this spot!",

The service is not spectacular but you get what you pay for; the food was out within 5 minutes of ordering but our server forgot about us afterwards, they were pretty busy and short staffed. The pho was great! The broth had a delicious favor and the meat tasted great! I had the steak and fatty beef. I also had the mocha bubble tea that tasted more like Nutella but I still love it. I recommend this place if you just want a delicious comfort meal. Most of the people dining were Vietnamese families, so that should tell you how ethnic he pho is!",

Most people don't know what that is or don't offer it. We both love fatty brisket as well. I usually get vegetarian with beef broth. I love veggies and we get extra meat in his so I steal a couple pieces:). I like my tofu  thin cut so it's a little more crispy. This place has chunks but still good. I like the veggies they use too. No baby corn (yuck) and no mushrooms!!! They have 2 really cute aquariums that my daughter loves.  The guys we see every time we come are pretty gangster and I LOOOVE that. They are very nice and always get excellent service. You can tell this is a family run place and they mean business! Well done family we will see you every week!",

They are by far the most traditional Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte when it comes to their ingredients and flavor. Try their papaya Salad.. made with tons of extreme spice, shrimp paste, and raw crabs.. even someone from Vietnam will say that's pretty potent stuff!  Their pho is consistently good not the best in Charlotte but good.  Their Ban Xeo is awesome with the nuoc nam but do not order on Sunday's because for some reason they will not.  My favorite is their Mi Quang and House fried rice.  Their Mi quang is greasy but its suppose to be greasy.. VERY flavorful of great seafood and pork flavors!  Their fried rice is awesome due to the mixed ingredients and the \"Smokey\" flavor of the hot wok it was cooked up in... perfect combination of rice and soup!",

Came in on Saturday for a quick bite, not wanting to travel down independence to go to my usual Vietnamese spot.   The service started fine, quickly located my favorite dish on their menu and ordered promptly. Problem was I never saw my waitress again, she didn't even bring the bill. Had to get up and go to the front, which might be the system here, but as a newcomer that wasn't clear.   The food wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't amazing. If I am paying $10 for rice noodles and a few pieces of meat, I can get from the market for $2, I expect better flavor. I guess next time I'll take the time to drive down Independence for quality food.",

Pho Hoa is located in a small strip mall on Central Ave, just next door to the (now closed) Dim Sum.  When we walked in, we were seated immediately.  There were several bags of take-out waiting for pick up and the restaurant was about half full on a Monday night - all very good signs!  The walls are decorated with lots artificial flowers shining under fluorescent lighting.  Not great ambiance, but, that's not really why we were there :) .  At the tables, there were small menus underneath the glass - so that they are always visible and then larger menus with lots of photos.  The larger menu offers a variety of bun (vermicelli) and pho options, along with some spring roll appetizers.  I tried to order a glass of wine (offered on the under-the-glass menu, but not the larger menu), but was told they weren't serving alcohol today.  I'm unsure if they ever serve beer/wine, or just not on Mondays.    We ordered a seafood pho and a bbq pork bun (vermicelli).  They came out quickly - but, both were underwhelming and a bit bland.  The food was fine, but not exceptional.  I wanted to love it here, but the kitchen just didn't deliver the flavor punch that I expected.   Overall, I wouldn't not come here, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

I basically grew up eating pho from this franchise.  I was hardcore craving some pho tonight, so a few coworkers and I went to go try it out, based on the rave reviews.  Upon pulling up at the rather run down looking shopping center and ugly facade of the restaurant, my coworkers all looked at me like I was nuts for taking them to some run-down building in what seemed like the boonies (but obviously wasn't).  The inside was much more promising than the outside and there was a steady dinner crowd on a Wednesday night, which is pretty good considering that place is basically a lone gem on that stretch of road.  I've had one other pho place in Charlotte - Pho Plus in Uptown.  My coworker and I agreed Pho Hoa was better.  The broth and spice was super flavorful and on point and the meat amount was reasonable.  The prices here are slightly higher than I've paid in Atlanta, but it's still 100% worth it.  I got the steak (which could have been more rare, in my opinion, if I had anything to complain about), tripe (yum!), tendon, and beef ball soup.  You can build your own pho here, which allows you to customize.  Their menu is set up in a way that helps pho-beginners choose their dishes and more experienced-pho'kers to more complex dishes.  The appetizers are so-so here - cha gio (fried spring rolls) are filled with juicy and flavorful meat and comes with the standard nuoc mam (fish sauce).  The goi cuon (summer rolls with pork and shrimp) are a little lackluster and puny, but that's not to say they weren't still delicious.  Comes with a hoisin/peanut sauce.  On a side note, Jeremy Lin eats here!  Staff/owner was really nice.  Would definitely come back when I am in town again.",

After a staggering 11 hours in the car returning home from upstate NY, along with a weekend full of carb induced hangovers, a pipping hot bowl of pho was just what my tummy ordered. Fresh veggies, herbs and just the right amount of sriracha and I was ready to get my stomach back on track for the week.   We ordered the summer spring rolls to start and the chicken pho for my entree. The spring rolls were on point with the fresh ingredients and creamy peanut dipping sauce. The chicken pho was just as good as the last time I came. The enormous bowl of noodle, chicken and broth goodness had nothing on me though. I finished just shy of becoming a fish and floating away.   Service is always pleasant and quick, with the food arriving in minutes of ordering. Favorite part of the scenery, in the winter there's a lovely kumquat tree near the register (if you've never experienced a kumquat, you're missing out on natures very own sweet tart), huge tank fully of funny looking fish and in the very center of the restaurant a community table that has more laughs than the joker.",

The quail is also delicious and great to share. If you're a chili head, they have a special chili paste that will burn your head right off your shoulders. The folks who run Pho Hoa are really great people and they are always happy to help you choose an entree if you're not familiar with the cuisine. Enjoy!",

After going inside, the restaurant is actually pretty spacious, unlike most pho places on central ave, which are pretty cramped.   The server is decent, not overtly rude like a lot of pho places, she even came back to ask how the food was. This place never looks very packed to me, I drove by on multiple occasions.   You can substitute egg noodles for pho noodle for an extra 50 cent. The quality of the dishes here are decent. I'd say 4/5. Price wise, a bit higher than other pho places around.",

The pho was good for being in an area where Vietnamese food is not too popular (I am from Northern Virginia/DC where the Vietnamese community is very large). There was a good amount of meat and pho noodles in a small bowl, which I thought was bigger than an average small pho bowl (but I might be wrong). The broth was super hot when our order came out and definitely satisfied my pho craving, as I am from Blacksburg, Virginia (Virginia Tech) where we don't have any pho places locally.

I was trying to be healthy and order Pho Ga, should of stuck with regular Pho seeing that it's not a popular dish here since the meats seem like it came from a wings or thighs. There were definitely no chicken breasts (white meat) there!  Then when I do ordered the Pho Dac Biet, they give you so little noodles. The meatballs look like it's been cut 10 times into small pieces from one meatball.   BUT the papaya salad, gets me salivating. Everyone knows this is the place to get your papaya salad.

    "text": "There are two pho restaurants on Central Ave with the SAME NAME! One is Anh Hoa Pho while the other is Pho Hoa. I've already reviewed the former, this review is for the latter.   This place has been around forever. Situated right next to Dim Sum Chinese in a little run down strip with limited parking. I used to frequent this place when I lived in the area but this is my first time back in years.   The restaurant layout is the same and like most Asian restaurants, there's a fish tank by the register. The menu has been upgraded though. You're given a menu once seated however there is another menu of additional items placed between the table and glass cover.   I ordered Hu Tieu from the table menu which is stir fried glutinous rice noodles with seafood and veggies. Also tried their egg rolls, summer rolls and papaya salad.   Let's start with the papaya salad. With this being a Vietnamese pho restaurant, I was very surprised to see that they served Lao papaya salad. It's 100% authentic, right down to the baby salted crabs, Thai eggplants and a side of kapoun- rice noodles. The salad was a tad salty but mixed with kapoun, It was PERFECT! Just the right balance of spicy, sweet, sour and salt - the four main Lao flavors.   The egg rolls were basic but they serve It with nuoc mam (fish sauce,) a leaf of romaine and do chua  (pickled carrots and daikon, same that you'd find on a banh mi) The proper way to eat an egg roll is in a lettuce wrap. Tear off a chunk of egg roll, add some of the pickles and wrap It in a little romaine, dipped into the fish sauce. Most places use the lettuce leaf as a garnish and don't include the pickled veggies. This places gives you what you need to eat It the proper way. Love that!   The summer rolls were ok. It was boiled pork without shrimp and didn't include the fresh basil that I like. I wouldn't order It again.   The hu tieu was good but I've had better. The stir fried noodles in the dish were perfect. It was cooked on very high heat so I could taste the sear on the noodles which is my favorite part, along with the chewy texture that's a little sweet with sweet soy sauce. My only gripe about this dish is that the veggie and seafood toppings were a little bland and lacked a sauce.   Overall, this place is good. I gave four stars for their papaya salad and egg rolls. I'll def be back whenever I'm in the area but I'll only order those two menu items. Or maybe I'll try their pho - maybe.",

We have tried the summer rolls, which are a very generous portion size served with peanut sauce, beef pho, and chicken pho. Our personal favorite is the chicken pho #18 and it always comes loaded with vegetables and veg moist/tender chicken!",

If you're coming on a Sunday lunch, you may have to find a place to park outside of the cramped plaza.  Option limitations aside, I thought this has been one of the tastiest Pho places in Charlotte so far.",

I asked for a to go bag no they told me to get one at check out, mind you I had my 2 year old with me. So while juggling everything, my 2 year old reached out to me and pho fell on him. Pho with sriracha. I now remember why we haven't visited in a very long time.",

    "text": "I come here on Mondays when my beloved Lang Van is closed. They have really great Pho and awesome customer service.   Typically when I order here, I order to go because ugh Mondays, am I right?! I just wanna put on my jammies and eat my pho at home.   Whenever I arrive the order is always ready. I order typically order the pho chay or vegan tofu pho. They also do a good tofu summer roll and my mom loves the pho tai.   Whatever I get, I get it with bread. Their bread is really good Vietnamese baguette. Soft and chewy with a hint of sweetness. Very well done.   The pho itself if always piping hot when I arrive home but I typically nuke it to get that scalding pho temperature I love. (It's \"Devil Wears Prada\" sadistic...I know).   The flavor is phenomenal. I mean so flavorful you want to call back and say, \"Uh are you sure this is veggie broth?!\" It's unbelievable. Hit it with the hoisin-sriracha blend (beware: they put both in the same travel ramekin)  and your traditional Pho accompaniments and its heavenly. I'm salivating just thinking about it.   I know they are a \"chain\" but their pho and their service  are Mom-and-Pop/local good. The guy at the front counter is always super friendly and must be a standup comedian in his free time because he's HILARIOUS !   Definitely stop by this place a grab some delicious pho, they won't let you down. Even on a Monday when you're sick, in need of Pho and all the rest of the Vietnamese restaurants have forsaken you, they've got your back.",

Positive feedback indeed!  The service isn't anything to write home about, but it's not horrible either.  They'll take your drink order and bring your drinks. They'll take your food order and bring your food. Not much checking back. but it's okay. Everything worked out and the food was so delicious!

I get the tofu pho in beef or chicken broth. I am not vegetarian but prefer tofu. The chicken is white meat though and looks appealing. The broth is smooth creamy and delicious. Slurp it all up! Veggies that accompany the pho are fresh and plenty of bamboo shoots, jalapenos, basil, cilantro to add to it. Always get a bubble tea too to-go and just recently asked if they had non dairy option since the milk always bothers my stomach and they made me one with coconut milk and it was delicious! Tapioca balls are not old tasting and they always put a ton of them in there. Wait staff seems short handed but its all good, food comes out so quickly.

He did not apologize, but reacted upset and immediately started speaking loudly to the other staff and then looked to my husband and asked if I wanted a new bowl. I did NOT want a new bowl.. I had immediately lost my appetite. But to my surprise when we went to check out, they did not give us the soup for a discount or even offer a slight apology! Later, when I told the story to my friends.. I was informed a similar situation had happened to them also, except I should be glad It was only a rubber band, because they found a cigarette in their soup!",

D) Their in house \"specials\" menu has all the classics, and their style of prep is different enough from other Viet places to be interesting.

Two US dollars will buy you a bowl of pho in Vietnam. This is not Vietnam, this is the US where people have to pay rent. You'd be surprised how much rents are even in places like Central Ave. These people are legit. Le, the owner, what can I say, beautiful person inside and out. And when discussing congee with daughter-in-law Terri, I expressed my apprehension of eating pig uteri, and she, actually being Thai and not Vietnamese, explained \"we eat everything, honey.\" I had to laugh. It is many Asian peoples' comfort food, and I have yet to try it here, but as far as everything else, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Just wish they were closer to the airport and served bigger glasses of wine. The best thing about Pho Hoa? They open at 8:30 in the A.M. Outstanding.",

Stuck with my usual pho tai--surprisingly good broth. Hearty, beefy, subtle, and the noodles were just right. The meat was a bit thicker than I prefer. The limes were juicy, but the sprouts and basil appeared to have been in a skirmish and both lost. Bruised and limp, they did their inadequate best.  I do wish pho places would give an option for different bowl sizes.   Vietnam Grille and Lang Van have more aesthetically pleasing interiors. Lang Van has a selection of wines. Both have attentive staff.   I should mention that I went to Pho Hoa yesterday only because Lang Van turned out to be closed on Mondays (which I never saw mentioned on their website).",

The vegetarian and the seafood pho are also good choices. You MUST finish with a 'bubble tea' - what they call their boba drink, a smoothie with tapioca pearls (I've had bubble tea all over the U.S. and Pho Hoa does the best - perfectly firm tapioca) - I recommend these flavors: mocha, taro, green tea, Vietnamese coffee or Avacado. Just try it...you can thank me later!",

    "text": "YUM!  My friend and coworker knows the owners of this place. We went here today for lunch and it was amazing. It was her idea: after her disappointing bun at Zen Fusion last week, she wanted to take us to get real vermicelli noodles at a real Vietnamese place.  We got there a bit before lunch so the place was really empty. Our waiter was super attentive and excellent. Service was great throughout our entire meal, and it looked like as the restaurant filled up, he was just as attentive to every table (not just because  I was with a VIP).  I got the vermicelli pasta with grilled pork and crispy pork spring rolls. IT WAS SO GOOD. It comes out at room temperature and then you dump these spices and fish sauce over it to make the sauce. They have a variety of hot sauces on the table for you to make it as spicy as you'd like. My friend requested this special habanero chili paste (which I could not use) but I smelled it and it was totally legit. I used the red chili paste, and was able to get my Bun just to the spicy level I like it.  The veggies were fresh (some cucumbers and bean sprouts) and the fresh basil was a perfect addition. The veggies and pork spring roll gave my noodles just the right amount of crunch. We got some fresh lime for our dishes as well.  We finished our meal with bubble tea. I am not a huge fan of bubble tea, but I have become a convert. I had the avocado bubble tea, and let me tell you, LIFE CHANGING. It is made with fresh avocado (sweetened up, of course) and it was delicious. I tried my friend's coconut bubble tea, and that was equally as delicious (but apparently made with powder according to the owner). Still really good.  The restaurant was full by the time we left. Obviously it is popular. And I cannot wait to go back!",

I just wanted to order something and have it delivered but than I remembered that I am house & dog sitting and they act like wild beasts when the doorbell rings. So, I consulted my bf (yelp) for some help... after figuring out my options in a mile radius I decided to try Pho Hoa  Good decision!  This is exactly what I needed.  The staff was pleasant and helpful and explained what my veg options were.   I was in, out and back to the pad in under 15 minutes.   This was my first experience with vietnamese food but now I'm hooked.  I got soup with vegetables and tofu.  The tofu was baked and soaked up the flavorful broth but didn't get too soggy. It came with a bunch of fresh herds like cilantro, mint, and thai basil as well as jalapeno and lime slices.  Being a first timer I wasn't exactly sure how to assembly it but it's pretty much common sense.  Put the noodles, veggies, sprouts, herbs, and tofu in a bowl and pour the broth over top.  I know that sounds boring but it was delicious! Granted I added the hoison sauce they included and some sriracha I found in the fridge but I tried the broth on it's own to try to figure out if it was vegetable of miso based and although I still don't know I can tell you that its yummy.  After eating about 1/3 of the portion size my tummy feels happy.  Thank you Pho Hoa Restaurant for being the best part of my day!",

There's a section on the menu for beginners (aka me) that has easy to identify meats, and pretty much straightforward with ingredients. I went with steak and fatty flank. The large bowl is ENORMOUS and could easily fill three people or serve three meals for one person. I LOVE the plate of fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, Thai basil and jalapeno. The taste of Fresh ingredients is something I love in this great world of food, and this def hits the nail on the head.  Perfect amount of spice in the broth, and def could be a saving hangover cure, or just a good comforting meal on a cold day.  Being that this was only my first time, I gave it three stars simply because I don't know if pho hoa offers \"THE BEST\" or \"most authentic\" pho. I will def be coming back though, hungry as ever!",

We were seated very quickly, as there weren't many people, and within five minutes of ordering, we both had steaming bowls of pho in front of us. The broth was clear and flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. They gave us a lot of meat (definitely your money's worth!) and I particularly enjoyed the steak and fatty brisket. My mom thought her broth was on the salty side, however, and she didn't finish all her meat because it was too much. This place has reasonable prices for a nice bowl of pho that really hits the spot, and when you come, be sure to add the basil (check to make sure it's fresh first though), bean sprouts, lime, cilantro, jalapenos for a nice kick, fish sauce, and sriracha to your soup. It really brings out the flavor. I'd definitely come again, as there are no good pho places in Chapel Hill.",

The menu is expansive in the pho selections and you can make your own. I had the flank and the steak. Fantabulous! Rich, savory, and just what I was seeking in coming here. The staff were more than accommodating, and one of them was a little goof ball who kept making me laugh.   Quite the enjoyable experience!",

The pho was okay, just a small portion for a pretty standard price and at the end we discovered two flies in our broth.  Not appetizing.    Not the worst pho I've had but certainly not the best.",

I was starting to write off the city on Asian cuisine - Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese ... but my mom and I drove all day from DC back to CLT and wanted a warm, easy meal. She suggested pho and hesitantly I came to Yelp! Pho Hoa immediately came up with awesome reviews. So I called and put in an order of chicken pho. The man on the other end of the phone was kind and let me know the food would be ready in 10 minutes. A quick drive over to plaza midwood and we picked up the food. The man at the counter was super sweet (I'm pretty sure the same man on the phone).   We came home and split the large chicken pho which was plenty of food for two. It came with tons of veggies - carrots, snow peas, onions, baby's corn, cabbage, broccoli and all the regular toppings of sprouts, basil, cilantro, spicy sauce, and noodles.   This pho was fantastic!! One of the best pho's I've ever had!!!   Highly recommend and I can't wait to return with my husband! (Also I ate too fast to take a picture - yelp elite fail!)",

Against the advice of the menu, I got too ambitious on my first trip and ordered one of the more advanced meat combinations (the tendon, etc. proved too chewy for me and kind of ruined my perspective).  This time I went safer and WOW.  The broth here is amazing, and everything is really fresh.  The staff are incredibly friendly and talkative, which was nice.  They also make a homemade pepper garnish out of reaper peppers.  Delicious!   Very highly recommended!",

This is probably the best pho I've had in Charlotte so far.  I love the variety of options they have for the pho, including the build your own option!  I went with a brisket bowl and it was phenomenal.  Pro tip: order a large size for like a dollar more, and you might have leftovers for another meal.  Anyway, brisket was awesome and they have all the normal options to add to your pho and spicy sauces.  If you are feeling extra spicy, ask for the super spicy sauce made with the world's hottest pepper.  I did not try this.... but a friend who likes supppppee spicy things said it was amazing.   Also the fried spring roll appetizer was pretty good as well.   They have a small selection of alcoholic beverages for a great price. Got a glass of Chardonnay for $4, can't beat that!  Also they have a salted pickle soda drink (I'm probably saying this wrong) that is oddly refreshing and apparently very traditional.",

It includes shrimp, pork belly, and fall apart ribs in a savory broth with veggies, noodles..........it comes with egg noodles but I requested rice noodles instead.

    "text": "That was some gooooood pho! My go to chilly weather food was very well done by Pho Hoa, and with good service too! Water was refilled frequently and we were checked on just as often. Had the Hot and Sour Seafood Pho, and it had tons of flavor. Summer rolls were super fresh and light, the wrapper wasn't at all dry, which is usually a sign of pre-made rolls that are left to sit out. Portions were grand and prices were good. Brought some friends for their first go at pho and they seemed to enjoy themselves (and the food) immensely. They have a beginners pho part of the menu which could be helpful for the uninitiated.   Interior isn't too much to look at, but who goes to a pho place for atmosphere anyway? Location is in a small plaza on Central Ave next to Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant, look out for the bright green neon sign.",

I love the Laos style papaya salad but the 3rd time I order the dish it was disappointing.  The sauce was different.  Maybe they ran out of their regular/original sauce or the papaya salad was not made by the usual individual.  The most disappointing part was that I was raving about how good the papaya salad was to my people. When they finally got to taste the papaya salad from Pho Hoa, they didn't even get to taste the papaya salad that I was raving about.  I wish that they would have just told me that they were out of the main ingredient and I would have been fine with that response. If their sauce for the salad changed than I completely understand.  PRO: the papaya salad  CON: Lack of integrity.",

Their egg rolls are delish, obviously homemade, but skinny. The pho we ordered came out very quickly. The meatballs in my boyfriend's bowl were steamed not grilled though and had the texture of tofu. We were not fans. Service was okay, but it took forever to get a check at the end of our meal. I would come back on a cold rainy day.",

    "text": "A gem in Saigon Square. When I drove up to this place, I realized that I had come here five years ago, and was greeted with that nostalgia.   Walking in, you're greeted almost immediately with dysfunctionality. The place is packed, waiters and waitresses everywhere, with no one to sit you down. After a few minutes of waiting around, people getting up to pay, you're greeted by a waiter and shown to your seat. You get a menu with all the dishes on it, and other menus such as the bubble tea are engrained into your table. The menu is informative with mostly every kind of dish and ingredient presented in picture form. Extremely easy to pick and choose.   The only issue I had initially was picking out something I wanted to eat. I knew I wanted pho, but just couldn't quite get the meat selections from the choices listed in the menu. It also didn't help that one of the waitresses asked us what we wanted every two seconds. After seeing us stress over the menu, a male waiter came by and asked if we were ready. When we couldn't pick, he mentioned that it didn't really matter which one we chose and that we could pick any of the meat toppings as the price didn't change. This helped us out greatly and we picked with ease.  The pho was extremely good. I don't come from an area that provides good pho. (Cough Chapel Hill step your game up). So read my review with caution. But I loved the pho, the broth was clear, packed with meat, and a lot of noodles. It filled me up. Which is unusual because most soup noodle dishes do not.  Overall, the food was fantastic, the service could have been better, but would definitely, definitely recommend this place to satisfy your pho cravings.  P.S the specials of the restaurant are posted on the walls of the restaurant, such as Bun Bo Hue, so look at the walls for the specials before ordering!",

We had the Pho Thai. The bowl had the perfect mix of meat and noodles with a ton of great flavors of cilantro, green onion and basil. I love when Pho comes with a side a cilantro (not all Vietnamese restaurants do). They also had fish sauce, Peper, hoizen, Siracha all at the table and the bottles were very clean (didn't have the crusty leftovers on the lid like some places). I will be going back here for sure.",

Definitely could compete with my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in China Town NYC. Fast service, fantastic food. Try the Mi quang (off menu on the \"daily specials\" posted on the wall) if you're looking for a more heartier soup- flat yellow noodles in almost a peanut sauce hoissen sauce, not sure how else to explain it but definitely ask about it. Delicious. I always get fresh summer rolls and pho with beef (on the side so it's rare), tendon and brisket (which isn't really a Vietnamese thing but it's amazing), sometimes tripe if I'm craving the texture. Only odd thing is that they give you fortune cookies when you pay/leave but hey, I don't mind the sweet treat.",

    "text": "Came in with two Vietnamese friends on Saturday lunch and were seated very promptly. The place was just starting to get busy.  For appetizers, we started with eggrolls and spring rolls. I'm usually a big fan of spring rolls, but these weren't my favorite. I couldn't quite pinpoint what I didn't like about them. Not to say they were bad, just not my preference of style. The eggrolls on the otherhand were really good. They were fried in fairly new oil and packed with ingredients that provided a full flavor pallet. I'm usually not big on eggrolls just because of the grease and heaviness, but these were really good.  For the entrees, we ordered Mi Quang and forget the other dish we ordered (BBH maybe?). Both were off the menu on a specials menu and both extremely good. The Mi Quang had egg noodles in a slightly spicy broth filled with meats (pork belly, ribs, shrimp, and more). It also came with a plate of black sesame rice crackers that I enjoyed dipping into the broth. The egg noodles were cooked for not too long to make it mushy, as well as not too little to make them hard. This dish was awesome. The other entree had a mixture of egg noodles and rice noodles. It was in a pho-like broth also with a variety of meats (same as the Mi Quang). For being the amateur I am with Vietnamese food, these both were pleasantly new surprises which broadened my horizon on Vietnamese foods.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and venture into the atypical Vietnamese dishes that aren't offered at your run of the mill Vietnamese Restaurant.",

We were sat right away and the waitress brought our drinks. T start we ordered fresh rolls with pork and shrimp that were just okay. What made total difference was the peanut sauce that has been the best one I've tried so far J They had many options to choose from but since I am a Pho lover a had the brisket Pho and my husband had some type of pork. Food came out quickly and it was really good! Their decoration is nice, the staff is friendly and fast and their prices are regular for the type of restaurant. They have a cute aquarium with many pretty fishes. Even though this restaurant is not on our daily route we are highly considering to go back, because it is really worth it!",

I got there right before close due to my late work schedule, and considering so, I was a little afraid that I'd be too late and the kitchen would be closed. They allowed me to sit and eat and enjoy my meal with no rush. Granted, I did not need a menu because I knew exactly what I wanted to order and did not want to be a pain and waste any time. I got the summer rolls and the pho tai. DELICIOUS! I LOVE extra cilantro in my pho and that came [standard] on the side along with my limes, jalapenos and sprouts. It was excellent! SO glad I took an uber 15 mins outside of the city to get to eat here! Thanks to the staff for their excellent and friendly service and to the cook(s)/chef for the excellent food!",

Rad.  Jalapenos are freaking hot.  Sriracha is an institution.   Loved the Pho Thai. Some of the most \"buttery\" broth I've had to date. Broths vary from restaurant to restaurant and Pho Hoa makes the short list for me. The summer rolls are top notch, too.   Plenty of boba options, too. I'm a large proponent of the avocado variety.",

I like things spicy so I added jalapenos, a touch or hoisin sauce and some sriracha. Also, this place has BUBBLE TEA! I have been looking everywhere for a place and finally found one. I went with a suggestion and got the avocado bubble tea. I was a little hesitant because I wanted something more fruity, but I'm so glad I tired this.

Once I got the Pho and the second time I ordered a vermicelli noodle bowl.  Both were absolutely delicious.  You get a lot for your money as well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the parking can be somewhat difficult, but it won't stop me from eating here.  I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Just delicious. My only gripe was that my stomach couldn't hold more.  Ordered the summer rolls and the Ph Tai, Bo Vien (soup w/meatballs & steak). Luckily everything is numbered and there are lots of pictures so making a fool of myself by trying to pronounce the menu items was optional. I didn't even really notice the menu on the table until after I'd ordered off the one handed to me, lots of great sounding items I'll have to try in the future.   The rolls arrived within 90 seconds of placing the order. I was very surprised and the dipping sauce was perfect. I'm often skeptical of sauces sprinkled with peanuts as I've found it means you're about to dip into pure peanut overkill, but the sauce was balanced really well. The rolls themselves were nice- crunchy/crisp insides and the paper wasn't the pre-made &sitting out rubbery mess I almost expected since they arrived so quickly.  About three bites into my roll, my pho arrives. A really nice balance of broth to filling ratio, lots of noodles, lots of reaaaaally long fatty pieces of steak that made me happy no one was sitting across the table watching me attempt to eat them, and was served with the plate of bean sprouts/basil/lime/hot peppers slices.   Sriracha was plentiful, water was filled as needed, and the restaurant itself was fairly quiet, though I felt like if I had arrived an hour earlier during the peak lunch time it would have been a different story. All of the service staff I interacted with was extremely friendly and I will definitely be returning for more!",

Thinly sliced steak, rice noodles, onions and broth in a fairly large sized bowl. You then have the option of adding your own seasonings. I added: jalapenos, cilantro, basil, fish oil, soy, sugar, hoisin sauce, sriracha and chili paste oil.   You can adjust the amount of each ingredient to suit your palette. Mix it all together, grab some chopsticks and a spoon and GO!   I will say my lips are absolutely on fire! Note to self: less sriracha and chili paste next time!   You're welcome.",

    "text": "I'm Asian (not Vietnamese), with a good appreciation of a good pho bo (beef noodles) when I see one.  The pho bo here is the best I've tried in Charlotte imo:  Their broth, which is the key to a good pho, is flavourful with the right balance of beef, bones and herbs, but I also noticed some MSG in there too.  Out of a few pho places around CLT (Saigon, Doan, Vietnam Grill, Truc) I think they have the best pho soup here.  More importantly, their pho is served HOT - makes a hell of a difference for me who like to put almost all the garnishes into the soup, and my pho stays at the right temperature when I'm half way through it.  This seems to be a small detail that many other places overlook.    Prices are also more in line with those in NYC and California.  You really shouldn't have to pay more than $8 or $9 for a regular pho these days.  The location is a bit meh, but for such a good pho I'm willing to make the trip there frequently.",

A location in Atlanta back in the day was slick and modern, but this one comes off as a homey, warm mom-and-pop pho shop.    We had Christmas Eve dinner here, the only time we took a break from my brother's excellent home-cooking over the holiday.  This was definitely better than average pho, at least for those of us who live in the 98 percent of this country that does not have heavy Vietnamese popluations:  rich, silky, complex broth; properly prepared meats; and plenty of fresh condiments.  Big goi cuon were a little bland, though, lacking in fresh herbs, but the accompanying peanut sauce was bold enough.  Good soda chanh, although $4 seems a little steep.  Service was pleaseant and efficient.  Appropriately interesting music for a pho restaurant--instrumentals that sounded like a bizarre cross between traditional Vietnamese and Hollywood western movie music.  Overall, a good one.",

They had large pieces of mint in the rolls that were just overwhelming. They lack other flavor as well.  But still a recommendation for relatively cheap but good Vietnamese food.",

Firstly the staff gets a 5 as well, so happy, friendly and eager to help you find exactly the dish for you. We love pho but I've never ever, even in NY Chinatown seen so many options! I love it! I wanted to try something else and he suggested the chicken pho, and wow!!! I loved the pea pods, cabbage, carrots and broccoli all still crispy, along with the regular awesome rice noodles and great toppings. The kids had all kinds of non conventional things in their pho and loved them all! (I was nervous on the tendon, tripe etc). Wonderful food, great service and fantastic prices ($8.95!) along with wonderful other options of vermicelli bowls and rice bowls.. Yay! Our new favorite for pho hands down :)",

I didn't care for the pork - maybe others would, but the flavoring and overall look/texture of it was not appealing. The lettuce was shredded like from an inexpensive taco place (or like taco salads back in middle school), but overall the dish itself tasted fresh and ok. The fried rolls were good, but I haven't really met poor ones. Overall, I prefer Vietnam Grill or Lang Van for Vietnamese food in Charlotte.",

They even have kid pho, with the noodle already cut up for them! Our 3yo was excited about that.",

They served our dishes out pretty fast which was real nice! I would recommend everyone to come here if you want some AUTHENTIC food, and if you want to support your local small family buisness! I'll make sure to come here everytime I stop to North Carolina ! This place is YUM !",

I ordered the plain pho and noodles without meat for $5.50 while the bf got a large chicken pho for about $9. The food took a while but that's ok considering the crowd and the server was very nice and helpful (the menu is a little intimidating). The pho was delicious and comforting, the broth was not as flavorful as pho plus. The large is too large for anyone to finish. Total came to $17 plus tax.. Cheaper than pho plus and larger portions too. Will be back for more.",

I usually get #15 which comes with all the different type of meats. If you don't like noodles than you should try the beef stew and you can get it with noodles/ bread. I eat mines with rice which is also an option, but you have to tell them since its no listed.   If you are craving for papaya salad than your at the right place. Its top off with peanuts and the sauce have fermented crab meat. But you can  always tell them to leave it out.   Over all you should give this place a try.   Oh they also have daily noodle spacial thats no on the menu. Just look up on the walls and you'll see what they are.",

SO good with a great flavored broth, tons of meat and a mix of vegetables...and all the traditional toppings such as fresh jalapeno, mint and cilantro leaves, bean sprouts and fresh lime.  Add in prompt and friendly service and reasonable prices!  I'll definitely be back!!",

I usually get the steak and brisket pho, or the Bun Tom Tht Nng (vermicelli noodle bowl with grilled pork and shrimp) and an order of their amazing crispy quail.  If you haven't tried the quail you have to!",

    "text": "Pho Hoa is located in a shopping center a bit down Central where there's also an asian diamond store. So you know, you can order pho and jewelry all in one place. The inside is absolutely mom and pop - the guy at the cash register had been working there for 20 years so it's definitely a family business, regardless of the fact that they're part of a national chain. We were seated quickly and started off our meal with an order of the Summer Rolls (I don't care that it's winter, the mix of thai basil and shrimp will always lure me into ordering them). They were good!  Fresh ingredients makes this a super refreshing appetizer, and the peanut sauce served along with it complimented all flavors well. For our main meal, I ordered Pho with Steak and Meatballs and The Lady ordered Vegetarian Pho (ask for pho with vegetables). The broth that they use is insanely good, and if you look into their website, you'll see it's made from lean meats and not marrow, which makes it actually pretty dang healthy!  The service was especially slow for such an empty dining room, but it looked like there were 3 people to handle constant delivery/pickup orders as well as man the front desk, bus, and clean. It took a good 10 minutes for us to get the attention of somebody for a to-go box (and I ate the leftovers of the hefty dish today for lunch, just as good the day after.... *swoon*)  The prices are wonderful here. 2 phos and an order of spring rolls left my wallet only $22 lighter, which is an incredible price for 2 meals worth of food for 2 people. Definitely recommend trying out Pho Hoa!",

Of course, they are now both lovers of these things, because how could you not be? The bubble tea was sweeeeeet, as it should be, and the pho was delicious, with plenty of options for add-ins. I had the brisket pho, and although I didn't eat much of the meat, getting that kind makes the flavor, for sure. The ambiance, like several pho places I've been to, felt like someone's kitchen, and the service was very fast, although everyone there was definitely not interested in talking to us, except the man at the register, who was great. (In their defense, however, we were dressed like fools.) Would certainly come back!",

Warning about that sauce if you are not someone that can take it.  :)",
