It was the perfect blend of ingredients...I will be a frequent visitor.  Also don't be fooled by the name they have a great selection of teas as well.  We were greated at the front door by whom I'm guessing is the owner/manager.  She gave us a full description of each pastry.  She was very friendly and helpful.  Give this place a try, I'm sure it will not be your last.   Let's put this place on Charlotte's most wanted list... : ) Looking forward to seeing you there...",

It was warm and smooth with none of the of the sugary aftertaste that can linger in your mouth. A bit of milk (you can also choose from diff milk substitutes). Subtle aroma of lavender -very sophisticated. Just the right amount of caffeine pick me.  Didn't get to try the huge dessert selection or hang out that long on this trip, so I gave Crema 4 stars. I'll be back in to try everything.",

Stopped in the other day with a friend after a long day of being out in the sun, but couldn't decide on what I wanted. The barista was more than happy to not only give recommendations, but to customize anything to my liking. I know that is what coffee shops are supposed to do, but typically in most stores people get upset when you try to make changes to their established drinks. Ended up getting a matcha latte with espresso and was not disappointed. Will definitely be back to try their creative tea lattes, desserts, and wine tastings!",

The  honey lavender was delicious, doesn't need any additional sweetener. The top was sprinkled with lavender(wasn't really sure if i should eat them or spit them out. Lol ) The Coffee was a perfect strength for me.  Iced latte was also very satisfying-laced with honey on the bottom and sprinkles with cinnamon on top. The place is super cute. Great place to sit and do some work on your laptop or even read. Plenty of parking. Would definitely recommend. The barista was super friendly and helpful. They really make you feel welcomed with no pressure to order quickly. They also have lots of pastries to try that are all baked from scratch on the premises. Unfortunately we did not try any this time. If you want more of a breakfast meal they have many options.  If you happen to come later in the day this is also a wine bar as well.",

Everyone in there from the staff to the workers are so friendly. When they didn't have the drink i was looking for, Viola quickly recommended a similar drink and adjusted it to my dietary needs. Halfway through doing my work Hailey brought me over a glass of water without me even asking which was very thoughtful. I have already been back a second time and received the same amazing service. I have found my new favorite (and local) coffee shop!",

We also managed to order two items of food despite it not looking that great and both were okay. I got the banana bread and my husband got the scone. Scone felt like it came from a box.

I ordered the Honey Bun latte and had to have a Nutella Brownie-hello! I have to say there were both wonderful and I will back as their treats look amazing.  One point to note, which is the same issue with all small businesses--they have a sign up asking you to pay in cash, and this is due to the service fees they have to pay for using cards. Not a hardship unless you are like me and don't carry much cash. But was luckily I had cash because not only do I want to support locally, I don't want prices going up as a result of passing on service fees to the customers. Of course they take cards but it's another way to support locally.",

The tiramisu was so good. Also my friend got the tuxedo cake which was delicious as well. Loved the golden milk!! They also have wine here and some snack items.   The customer service was awesome. The girl working was super friendly and I really liked her. If you love tiramisu, please come check it out. They also have many other sweet options to choose from.",

    "text": "I often pass Crema when I do my weekly grocery shop at HT, but had never stopped in. Today was the day! I was at home when the internet went out, so I immediately knew I needed to go to a cafe to get a coffee and use the WiFi.   I entered the cafe and there was ample seating. A beautiful high top made of wood was along the left side of the space. Plenty of outlets were available.   I went to the front and ordered an almond milk iced latte. They have all the milks which is great!! I ordered, paid ~4+ for a small and inquired about the WiFi explaining that I had lost internet at home and needed it desperately. I sat at the high top table and proceeded to try and connect to the internet. My laptop was not cooperating.   The sweet woman who took my order brought my latte to the table and asked if I was able to get internet. I wasn't but I kept trying. The coffee was good, strong! My husband will really like it. The pastries looked great too - unfortunately, I didn't try any this time.   My gripe? After sitting in the cafe for about 15-20 minutes with my laptop open the woman let me and another guy sitting there know that they would be closing in about 15 minutes for a private event. She couldn't have been nicer about it, but seriously? I wish that I was told that prior to ordering and making it very obvious that I would be sitting there.   So, overall the coffee was good, the staff was sweet, but be more conscience of people buying and planning to enjoy their coffee and let them know before they order for dine-in that you are closing early!",

Their barista was so friendly and helpful - she walked us through their whole menu and presented us their incredible-looking pasties (I'll be going back to try those!). She greeted every person who walked through the door, which I loved.   They have tons of tea and coffee options, including a helpful illustration that outlines the different kinds of coffees you can order (wtf is a breve, anyway?).  There are many options for seating, including some stools and lots of tables and chairs. One wall is lined with padded bench seating that includes lots of pillows for comfort (a huge plus). The music wasn't too loud (also a major win) and if you want to be distracted, there's an active parking lot to watch (really, there are lots of people walking by).   I look forward to returning!",

The good: - Comfortable and inviting indoor and outdoor seating options. - Allow you to customize your crepes to fit your preference or dietary needs. - Great location with ample parking.   The bad:  - Takes a long time to order (at the counter) and a long time to get your food. We saw numerous patrons walk in, wait in line for a while, and then leave after seeing that the line wasn't moving. -It doesn't seem that they have enough employees working. The same 2 employees are making the crepes, making the coffee, taking the orders, working the cash register, and cleaning tables.  -We would have enjoyed some side options with our crepes. The price for a single crepe is comparable to prices for a crepe and side at other crepe restaurants in the area.   Overall, the food was fine but not spectacular. The staff were friendly but visibly stressed (too many guests and not enough employees).",

First, know that they close kind of early (6-6:30pm) right now but they're planning to extend that.   Second - know that they they have beer and quite a nice wine list. Glasses of tasty wine are 1/2 off on Fridays yo!! Pair it with some nice cheese and charcuterie plates for a pre dinner nosh.   Third - know that they have a lovely bakery case full of things I want badly to eat but know I probably shouldn't. They explained pastries are \"Russian\" style and thus less sweet than you might be used to. Had I not had a dinner date, I would have torn it up!  Finally - the staff could not be nicer! My iced tea (mint) was made fresh and I felt truly welcomed.   Go here!",

So helpful and willing to cater to all dietary needs. They have a great variety!!  I originally had them with a flamming 5 stars, but changed that when I tasted the to go pastries.   Ordered... Ice coffee with a pump of Carmel and half & half- omg, it's refeshing, fresh, & delicious.  Mint Tea- loved it! It was made with fresh leaves & a fun dispenser   Crepes:      --You can watch them make it-- Sweet Bavarian Crepe- Incredible!  A decadent cream all house made, fresh cut up banana & strawberry.  Custom Savory Crepe- mozzarella & cheddar cheese, light spinach, & avocado. Really wonderful  2nd time ordering the Bavarian crepe        Both were over cooked        My friend had a Brush hair in her crepe =(  Pastries:   -I ordered these to go- Everything tasted so great before I had these.  What a shame! I might not be curious enough to taste any others. One taste and I was done with the three I tried! My friend thought they were only, ok.   Napoleon- Really not as flavorful as I would have liked, meh!  Earl Grey Pound Cake- grainy top almost had a burnt flavor, gross & washed out my mouth.  Berry delightful fruit puff- some berries on top were good, others looked wilted & had good Bavarian cream. The pastry was really dry and tasteless.   Originally... Thrilled about seeing the case of what looked like really amazing pastries. I made a list of all of the ones that caught my attention!! After 3 disappointing flavors, I am now sceptical about trying the rest of my list.   Next time I'd like to try  Bruche (French style)- Mini apple rose- Bravarian cream horn-",

We loved the personalized service, the cashier made an effort to see what kind of drinks we would like and made some recommendations. The crepes came out so fast and were a huge portion and just delicious. As we were finishing up, they brought out our pastries and coffee. It's not really a full service place, more like you order at the counter and they bring it out to you once it's ready. I like how they still went the extra step and provided table service by bringing out out items in order, I suppose because it wasn't too busy. Come here and support local business! Get one of the crepes with chicken and the lavender latte!",

The turnover had the most buttery, flakey delicious crust. The real star though was definitely the eclair. I am a HUGE fan of this place. I'll definitely return in the future.
