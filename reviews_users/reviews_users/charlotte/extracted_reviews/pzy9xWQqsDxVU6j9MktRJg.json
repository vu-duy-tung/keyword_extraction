    "text": "As of now this is my favorite Mexican restaurant!  I love this place!  Every time I go to Charlotte I make sure to go here!  Not only is the atmosphere here wonderful but so are the people!  The queso (cheese dip) is phenomenal.  The chips and salsa are great as well, it even comes with what I believe is Mexican coleslaw (I could be wrong on the name but it's some type of Mexican salsa lettuce thing) but I love to mix it into the salsa.  Although I may be eating it wrong, I definitely recommend mixing it with the salsa.  I always the pitcher of margaritas here.  Now if you're splitting it between two people you may not be able to finish it, it's strong and larger than it appears!  Be warned!   I think it's about 7 margaritas (or more) but it's a good amount for the price for sure! Moving on to the food mmmm delicious!  I have only ordered the tacos here so far because I'm so hooked on them I always get one soft and one hard chicken taco.  Usually at most Mexican restaurants I've been to the soft taco is always soggy because of all the juices coming from the chicken, but here it was perfectly moist and juices didn't drip down to my elbow lol.  The perfected the chicken taco! My experiences here have been nothing but great so definitely make your way here if you love Mexican and margaritas!",

    "text": "So I have to update my previous review from a 4 to a 2 and echo what a lot of other reviewers are experiencing - what the hell happened, Azteca?  While they have updated and spruced up the interior, quite honestly the food is not as good as it used to be and the newer staff needs some more training.  I know I am a fatty, but if I come in at 11:30 am, I expect lunch portions and lunch prices.  On a Thursday visit, I did get an extra flauta (I thought the menu changed, I didn't realize the waitress had done a dinner order), however that was not a good thing.  The flautas used to be crispy with well flavored meat.  The shell for mine was mushy instead of crunchy and the beef was dry, tough and flavorless.  For $7.25 I would have been irritated enough - for $10, I was kind of pissed.  The rice and beans are the same eh, fine, they have always been, cheese dip was good.  The chips tasted different and not in a good way.  I don't eat the salsa, so I can't speak to that.  I did see a several people that have been there forever, but I did see a lot of new faces too.  From the other \"meh\" reviews and my past two experiences, I do believe I will be heading to 1900 for Mexican lunches and Monterrey for dinner - Azteca just isn't cutting it anymore.",

My coworker and I shared the Fiesta Azteca which is a sampler platter and it was not very good. The chicken flautas were so dry drenching them in hot sauce didn't fix them! The potato skins were greasy and soggy, not crispy. And bacon wrapped shrimp were burned to prediction with a black charcoal taste! For a $26 appetizer, I was hoping for something more edible.

We would have not waited but thankfully the patio was first come first serve so we were able to sit immediately due to everyone else seeming to be a large party. The service was just ok but honestly I think it was because they were basically under attack by the amount of people trying to eat there so not holding that against them they were just trying to survive at that point. Given the busyness of the place the food came out rather quickly and the micheladas we had were to die for. Definitely recommend this place and don't be scared away if it seems really really busy!",

I ordered Small Combination plate with one taco & one enchilada.  I prefer care asada as my meat option, but I couldn't get it with this combo.  It's a different combination plate of 4 carne asada tacos 12.95.   So I choose shredded beef instead.   I did not try the guacamole.  The salsa tasted like hunts tomato sauce, and I didn't care for the shredded coleslaw they bring you.  Food came out and yes the portions are huge.  I ate very little.  Shredded beef tasted very bland in both the enchiladas and taco.   Rice I thought tasted mushy, but the beans were ok.  Won't be going back.  There are far better options for authentic Mexican food.  I'm sticking with Three Amigos.",

The front patio is the best place to sit when the weather is pleasant.  The portions are huge, so you really get a bang for your buck (this includes margs, sangria, and the draft beer. Make sure you hire a DD lol). You really can't go wrong with the menu, but some of my faves: Vegetarian burrito, deluxe burrito, Popeye quesadilla, seafood quesadilla, camerones con ongos (shrimp and mushrooms).  Tableside guac is a must. Queso is good too though. Of course, complimentary chips and salsa and pico, plus complimentary dessert (cinnamon toasted tortilla chips with honey, whipped cream, and strawberry sauce). Friendly and fast service. Parking may look small, but there's more in the back. Fun place to go for birthdays...free sundae and humiliation for the birthday guy or girl (they must wear a sombrero and be sung to by a mariachi band).",

Nope, it was just one giant, soggy, tortilla with shredded chicken inside and melted cheese on top. Additionally, the service left me wondering if our waiter struggles with a deteriorated mental state. Among other strange interactions, we were asked the name of the employee who brought us a bowl of queso which we did not order. When we told the waiter that we did not know this individual's name, he promptly confiscated our bowl of queso, which was approximately 75% consumed already. We asked if we could finish the bowl and our request was denied. The waiter further explained that he was going to have to pay for the bowl of queso out of his own pocket. The whole scene, from the death metal that was playing when we walked into the restaurant to the waiter asking us to compare pictures of what was on our actual plates to pictures in the menu (which weren't similar at all), seemed like something out of the twilight zone.",

Only causes I have for complaint would be the horrible mariachi band that roams from table to table, interrupting both conversations and meals AND the last few times there's always some type of panhandler outside by the door or in the parking lot. The restaurant is right in front of a ratty Days Inn and not in the best part of town, which likely explains this. Personally, I wouldn't go there in the evening by myself, but two or more in a group offers a bit more protection. At any rate, the great food makes it all worth it.",

A bit runny but the cilantro in it was flavorful.  We both ordered margs, as they were on special. Huuuuuge drinks! Very tasty. I could probably have handeled mine a bit stronger :)  We got the cheese dip as an appetizer. Very large portion that probably could have fed 8 but, of course, we devoured! It was very tasty and a good consistency (aka, not super congealed white stuff!).  We split the shrimp fajitas for dinner. Definitely plenty for two! They came with rice, beans, a small bit of guac, onions, peppers, and shrimp. Slightly dissapointed in the refried beans cause they were fairly flavorless. Plenty of shrimp to go around!  A-Ok meal!",

The important facts: white queso is very good, chips always come out hot and fresh, they have a \"soupy\" salsa that is good with not a lot of heat, they also have a shredded cabbage salsa that is more \"chunky.\" Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants some authentic Mexican food in Charlotte.",

Twice in the last year, they accepted our reservation for a group of 20-30 people, then when we showed up (on time, both times) they said very plainly and unapologetically that they had decided to give ALL of our reserved tables to other groups before we arrived. They didn't offer any solution other than  just waiting, and for 20-30 people, that meant waiting for at least an extra hour. So if you have a large group, don't bother trying to make a reservation here; and if you do, don't fool yourself into thinking not means anything.",

The outside is pretty lit up easy to find, inside looks like a typical Mexican place. The service was outstanding, however the food that I ordered fell a little short of my expectations. I Ordered the Carne Asada tacos, the upgraded one on the menu. When they came out the tortillas were soggy, I think they were supposed to be, but I just didn't care for that much. There wasn't a lot of Carne inside the tacos, and the pico de gallo was a strange lettuce combination that I also didn't very much care for.  The chips and salsa we're good however.",

Immediately got our drink order -- although a drink menu never showed, up so could order only what the server told us about. After drinks, was about 20 minutes before the waiter showed up again, to take our food order. The food came out and most of our group liked theirs. I found mine so-so, with the ribeye ordered medium rare and arriving somewhere between medium well and well done.   Our requested water for the table showed up about five minutes before it was time to leave, and we ran out of drinks about 20 minutes before our waiter checked in on us after our food got dropped off.  All in all, I've had better Mexican food, but I've far better service. Maybe ours was an anomaly, given all the other ratings, but I was pretty disappointed and probably won't repeat. Only highlight was the pleasant tableside guacamole service, although even they didn't ask as to spiciness level, something I'm used to from other restaurants that make fresh guac to-oder.",

I was pleased that even though the lot was full there was no wait and we were seated immediately.   No sooner than we sat down we had a basket of chips and two different salsas. I really liked their salsa. I wasn't a fan of the chips because they were not served up hot but I ate them anyway because the salsa was just that good. Spicy and delicious...just like I like it.   The menu had great variety and the prices were excellent! I ordered the Deluxe Taco Salad with chicken - It comes in a tortilla shell with tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream and cheese.   Our food arrived so freaking fast! My goodness! What a major win for the very hungry lunch crowd!   My salad was just okay. Don't get me wrong, it was not bad by any means and the portion size was not a problem. It was the tortilla shell. It was not crispy like I'm used too but that's just my personal preference. I still loaded it up with salsa and enjoyed every bite.    For the prices this place is a great deal for lunch. I'd definitely come back, there's so much more I have to try...See ya soon Azteca!",

I would've take more heat in the salsa as well, but I just really like spicy foods. Got the camarones Mexicanos and it was very good. Our server provided us with hot sauce that was perfect!

Apparently the cure for a hangover is their house made sopa, so off we went to this spot I had no idea was even here, stuck on the side of a Days Inn. I have to say, I was really surprised. The decor is fantastic, I instantly forgot I was mere yards away from South Boulevard and was transported to a Mexican hideaway. While I was headed to work and stuck with water, my friend had a beer the size of his face (hair of the dog that bit him.)   The food was delicious. I had the Lunch Special #38- Avocado Tostada- and got a kick out of saying it- 38 Special! Ha! It was really delicious, even the rice and beans which I normally shove to the side. We enjoyed our sopapillas for dessert, and then had a quick photo shoot on the mechanical donkey by the front door. Sorry to say it's not plugged in, but it's good for a stationary picture! I will definitely be back- their dessert menu alone is tempting me!",

The place looks like a total crapfest from the outside, especially being right there at a hotel in a dubious neighborhood, but trust me, once you go in the weird doors (the entrance always seems like it's in a transitional state of construction) you'll feel like you just discovered a hidden gem!  The not-so-good: If you're not with a large group, I recommend asking for a booth, because they tend to crowd the tables a little close.  Sometimes it feels like they're pushing you to join another party the way the tables get too close.  And then there's the waiters... I've gone here dozens of times, and at least 75% of the time I've had a weird waiter ogle me.  Even when I've gone with my father! They can be kinda shameless. Wear a turtleneck if it'll bother you that much.  And then there's the good.. which far outweighs the negatives: Their food is freakin' amazing, and plentiful!  Expect to get a big basket of warm chips & salsas as soon as you sit down.. They'll keep filling that up as soon as it empties, but save room for the meal- the food is the star here! Their shredded beef is spiced perfectly. (Most dishes come with ground beef, but they will upgrade if you ask - and it's a million times better!)  I love their flautas, and their enchiladas. (I'm a sucker for a good enchilada!)  I highly recommend their enchiladas suizas (green sauce and cheese- really really good).  There's really nothing bad on the menu, ever. And no matter what you order, their portion sizes are huge!    Don't feel bad about being too full for dessert.. they'll still bring you a little sopapilla with strawberry sauce & whipped cream with your check! It's the perfect little ending to a fantastic meal!",

    "text": "My husband and I just moved to Charlotte from Ohio and we have been on the hunt for a good mexican place. Needless to say we are still on the hunt. You would think the closer you get to Mexico the better the food, but that is not the case.  When we got to the place, there was a long line so we thought we were going to have to wait but we got right in. There was a live band playing music which was very nice and set the mood. The service was very prompt and polite.  The chips were just standard chips but the salsa was what I called onion soup with no flavor or heat, and they also served us with what looked like coleslaw. YUCK! I have been noticing that all the mexican places we go to have very soupy and or watery salsa which makes me very sad. My husband and I just got back from Cozumel and it was the most flavorful and thickest salsa you could ever have!  I ordered small combination number one (Hard taco and enchilada) and it was inedible! The taco shell was soggy, I had the server bring me a new shell but that didn't help. The beef in both the taco and the enchilada was a low grade beef like taco bell but with no seasoning (Must be the lack of dairy farms in the area). The enchilada tasted like a soggy diaper! I couldn't bring myself to even eat it. The rice was dry and tasteless and both the beans and the enchilada came with some sort of yellow cheese on top... that tasted awful. The beans were also watery underneath all the yellow cheese.  My husband got the chicken fajitas and we shared it. He seems to like all the food but he was a little tipsy from the very strong margarita. I thought the fajitas were just okay, the onion in them tasted like a sweet onion which i do not fancy. I ended up asking for more salsa because I was still hungry!  However at the end they brought some sort or sweet tortilla dessert. I thought that was a nice added touch but not enough to make me want to ever go back.  We paid 33.00 for 2 people and one margarita, so it was pricey. Either way the hunt is still on for a good mexican place in the Carolina's.",

It seems like the portions have gotten smaller though. It is always jammed for lunch but usually you are seated quickly.  The food is good and I especially like the pica de gallo (salsa).  The fact that they have been in business for so many years shows that they know what they are doing.  The prices are very reasonable.",

But someone recommended Azteca to us and I was not disappointed.  The food, while not outstanding, was much much better than other Mexican restaurants here and I especially liked how they prepared the guacamole table side.  Came at lunch time and found two very large groups (20 at each table) so expected to wait for food and drinks.  To my surprise service was prompt and food tasted fresh.  I'll definitely be back.",

The past couple of times we've been here for lunch, I've noticed the server barely comes back to see if you need a drink refill or anything else.  Today after he brought our food, he never came back again (and yes I wanted more tea!) until lhe saw the plates stacked at the end of the table and he asked us if we wanted to order anything else. The .50 tip I left reflected the level of service.  Also, as some other reviewers said, the salsa was very watery and the pork was fatty. Not the Azteca of a couple of years ago.  I'll go back because it's close to work and the taste of the food is good, but the service is lousy.",

Hubs and I were politely greeted and seated in a big 'ole comfy booth. The surroundings are reminiscent of a Chi-Chi's if you've ever had the unfortunate experience of visiting one. Mexican inspired and, well, Aztec-y. The chips were toasty and tasty but the salsa left me a bit sad. No chunks present - just watery blah. But no matter, the guacamole guy came rolling down the aisle and offered us some green magic. We asked for spicy guacamole and it was indeed full of heat...and flavor! My only gripe? For one avocado, the guac price was $7.95...that's steep IMO.   Onto the entrees...I ordered the enchilada & tamale combo. This option came out on a massive, shallow plate. MASSIVE and covered in sauce and or cheese. Hmph. I *think* the enchilada flavors could have been nice but the cheese dumbed down most of it. The enchilada far superseded the tamale - which was super, duper bland and cakey. The refried beans and rice were standard and nothing to write home about. Meh.  While the service was friendly and efficient, the meal also ended on a sweet note with those crispy cinammon bites with a dab of whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Free little chips of wonder - I could have easily eaten five of them in a snap. Will I head back to Azteca? Perhaps, if I'm in the neighborhood and positively craving Mexican...but I'm not rushing back here anytime soon.",

We were total of 16 folks all together and they took really good care of us. Even after the supprise, they brought drinks on time, the food were ordered and it came in resonable amont of time considering we were big group.   Even in between the supprise, apatizer and full dish items, we were hanging out like it was our place. No one bothered us and staff was very helpful in filling in our refills.

I was there with a relative who lives in Charlotte and we ordered light (me nachos and she the tres Leche cake, both good) and we were basically ignored for the entire time we were there. The food took so long to come out that we both joked about it. But honestly I was pissed about how long it took to get two simple dishes to our table and about how little attention we were paid.

I would've never thought to go to this place since it's randomly attached to the Days Inn but I went here on a whim a couple of years back and have been going ever since. They have fresh salsa along with warm, crisp tortilla chips and have a guac dude rolling around to each table if you so choose to indulge. Their portions are the size of a baby and they offer margaritas in different fruity flavors that are quite strong. I've tried different combos and like I said before, with portions the size of a baby, I often have leftovers. The nachos were amazing as well and were the size of a toddler and cheaper than my margarita (I found this very amusing) I've found service to better in the bar area when I go and you can't beat dining with Telemundo and ESPN in the background! They also give you free little cinnamon crispers topped with whipped cream after your meal. Yay for anything covered in whipped cream! Anytime I've gone there, the service and food are consistent which is a big plus in my world.",

Went for dinner on Saturday night, got there early and were sat right away.  The chips and salsa were good.  I ordered a Paloma, which was tequila and grapefruit juice and more, but I don't think its what I received.  I could have sent it back but it tasted fine, so I drank it.  We had some queso to start, that was also good.  For entree I got the camarones mexicanos, basically shrimp with onions, mushrooms, green peppers, in a tomato sauce with rice and cheese.  First shrimp tasted very fishy, the rest were better.  But the dish had a sourness to it, the mushrooms were the worst offenders and I couldn't figure out why so I stopped eating them.  So the food overall was fine but the restaurant kind of skeeved me.  There was water underneat my feet so that bugged me, then one of my friends touched some gum stuck under the table and at that point I was done.  I mean I know we're at a restaurant at a Days Inn but come on!!  Finally our server was just not very good or friendly and I sat with an empty water glass for a while.

Love the weird, ad hoc additions to the architecture - thatched roof beverage station awkwardly built into a corner, odd wood and glass entry hallway made more cramped by the quarter-for-a-bronco-ride thingy.   Everything here is slightly more compressed than the Matthews location - booths narrower, tables closer. Service more harried because they do a LOT more business here - even at a slightly off time for dinner, the place was hoppin'.   I could be imagining things, but I feel like prices were 50 cents higher than the other location, hmm. Servings were a tad smaller, for sure, but you don't need to finish that arm-sized burrito, anyway.   Onto the food: I got the Macho Burrito, he got the usual (fajitas). Now, I've had the Macho at Don Pedro, the other Azteca location, and here - it's a nopales burrito, so it's full of pickled cactus. This was by far the best version I'd had - because the jalapenos were fresh, so it wasn't almost too salty to eat (which, admittedly, has never stopped me from ordering it before). Goooood. A mild, almost mozzarella queso was used instead of the monterey jack I'm used to, continuing the low-sodium thing (except for the nopales). Awesome.  Fajitas were, well, Azteca Fajitas - smothered in sweet teriyaki-style flavors. Weird.  I'd come back if I were in the nabe and had a serious burrito craving, but I'd probably be thinking about the taco trucks and taquerias down the street the whole time.",

The portions are very good and the taste was excellent. I will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Guac is always a good idea, especially if it is made fresh next to your table. There is a small and a large option. The small is one avocado and was great for two people to share. We asked for everything, which from what I could quickly see was tomatoes, onions, parsley and jalapenos and the juiciest lime you could ever squeeze. She made it so fast and I loved that she let me try it after she was done. It was good the first time but I ended up adding more jalapenos because I was feeling for something spicy. PRO TIP: She travels with a tip jar on her cart and so have some dollars handy for her personal attention.   Carne Asada was the entree of choice. The meat was tender and portion was huge. It included beans, rice, pico and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. I also got a mango margarita, the mango mix was a little heavy but I knew it was to cover up the tequila and I'm never mad at a heavy pour. The food was very satisfying. The service was great despite being almost completely packed for Sunday Lunch.",

The place has a lot of charm with the decor and authentic sounding menu items (I have no knowledge of Mexican cuisine). However the booths are spaced way too closely and you end up banging knees with your dining companion if you sit across from each other. I'm all for a good banging but not in the knees thank you very much.  You get some chips and weird salad thing as well as extremely watery salsa to start off your meal while you decide on what you want. It's kind of nice but the salsa is mostly water so it just slides right off the chip. The food comes out blazingly fast though which is a great bonus if you are hungry and don't want to eat tomato water and chips. Almost everything comes with a salad of wilted iceberg that you can totally skip over, rice and refried beans. The beans and rice are really too salty to eat much of on their own though they were okay with what I ordered which was some sort of well cooked sirloin. Portions are huge, but I was still hungry afterwards because I did not eat most of it.  I was in such a rush to leave that I actually forgot my credit card here and had to return the next day to pick it up. I do not think I will return however if you like this sort of thing go for it.",

I ordered a Pacifico (on tap, no less!) and the chili verde with some corn tortillas on the side.   Meanwhile I occupied myself with the chips and salsa. Chips were okay, a little thick and not eatm, but not bad. The first two rounds are free. The salsa (red) came in a small shallow bowl, so difficult to dip. The flavor was mediocre. I asked for something spicier so they brought me their tomatillo salsa which (.first time I'd seen it) had chilis de Arbol in it. Spicy, but good.  Then the chili verde arrived, accompanied by refritos and rice. The rice was a little dry and bland; the beans were delicious!!!! A little too good as I ate more than I intended. The chili verde was okay, maybe a slightly different style than I've ever tasted. The pork was tender and served generously; the verde sauce didn't reflect the tartness of tomatillo very much and really had a stronger oregano flavor than I've tasted in other preparations.   Service was prompt and very friendly and the meal with beer and tip was less than twenty bucks. Worth checking out.",

But atleast you can walk off the extra calories. Decor is traditional. Bathroom is way to small for the amount of people inside.   Service was good. The only complaint I have is that you have to pay at the register at the hostess area. It just leads to a huge cluster of people up front if it's busy so you have to awkwardly stand around and be maneuvered around for those that need to be seated.   Food was delicious. I got the Quesadilla with chicken, rice and beans. It was really good and was the perfect size. They have lunch specials too and servers are available to answer questions.",

I ordered the deluxe burrito with rice and refried beans. \"Deluxe\" is the biggest understatement I've ever heard. This is the mac daddy Mercedes Benz shut your freaking mouth and say \"ah\" burrito. Chicken beans rice tortilla salsa sour cream guac tomatoes lettuce all checks across the board.

I've been coming here over the last 2 years and the service is always quick to please and friendly.  2. Food: The quality, quantity and variety of food they offer is wonderful. I've brought many people here from work over the last 2 years and not one person has had an \"average\" meal for lunch or dinner.   Their guacamole, super nachos, cheese dip, table salsa and chips, their beef, chicken and picadillo (my favorite) as well as the other things we've had on the menu..... it's simply very good to great food and the portions and prices are great.   Bottom line is that its a great place to eat at for lunch or dinner.",

They also have a free cinnamon tortilla chip with whipped cream and strawberry at the end! I would definitely return!",

They're speedy, you can call ahead and reserve a giant table, and they don't complain too much about haveing 20 seperate checks.  I normally order something small off the lunch menu, because I inevitably fill myself up with chips and salsa before my lunch even comes.  I always save room for the desert at the end!  Pro tip: if you're trying to get out of Azteca to head towards Billy Graham, go out the back of the parking lot to come out at the light.  Making a left onto Woodlawn is just plain crazy.",

Not to mention while we're getting terrible service the servers are all gathering around chit-chatting. Don't sit at any of the booths by the bar.   The food is great, guacamole is 5 stars, sweet tea is another good perk, wish I could have enjoyed this place and given credit to the food.

I got there before he did, so I grabbed a table and ordered a Dos Equis Amber, my favorite, and it was on special!  They brought me chips and salsa to munch on, which were good.  I asked if they had anything spicier- and my server, who was very attentive, sent over one sauce- checked in with me, then sent an even spicier salsa once he realized I could handle it.  I'm all about hot sauces and salsas, and they were both great!  The hotter of the two was pretty crazy I have to admit.  Anyways, my date arrived and we ordered a little later.  He ordered a burrito, which he enjoyed.  I got the mixed fajitas- my usual at a mexican restaurant- and they were decent.  Portion was good for the price- I believe it was around $12.  The shrimp were kinda small, compared to my favorite spot, Three Amigos, in Plaza Midwood.  It's a big restaurant!  If you have a big group, it would be perfect!  Very attentive service, and I loved the tortilla treat at the end.  Who doesn't like honey and whipped cream?!?  Yum.  I'll hit it up again if I'm in the area!",

Conveniently located near a Days Inn that may or may not offer hourly and monthly rates.  If fact we had to park facing this motel in the back of the restaurant. As we were walking toward the front of the restaurant, a kitchen employee did come out to cut or peel a vegetable over a trash can.  Hmmm... At the hostess station, we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside on the patio.  We chose inside because it was still hot outside.  No sooner that we sat down we were greeted with the loud mariachi band.  They are good but they are loud.  And the trumpet is even louder.  Anyways, because the mariachi band is loud, the patrons are even louder.  There was a table of 2 families sitting and the women were literally yelling at each other to tell a story.  It was quite obnoxious.  They had small kids with them who were wandering around the table and when the mariachi band came to their table.. of course one of the mom's stood up on her chair to do a dance.  In all my years of going to restaurants, I have never seen that.  I don't frequent strip clubs but I imagine that's what happens there.   Oh..the food.  The chips were good but the salsa was one step above tomato juice.  I asked for a spicier version and they brought a green salsa that had a little spice.  I ordered the Expresso Burrito which was supposed to be Chile Verde, rice, and beans.  Turned out to be chunks of pork but they were lean and tender.  Overall, decent Mexican food with a not so decent experience.",

    "text": "I've been to Azteca a few times, but this review is about our most recent visit on a Thursday night. When you pull up, it usually leaves people scratching their head as it is next to a days inn that has seen better days. However, don't be deterred! I've seen other yelpers tag it as \"dirty Mexican\", which is what my wife and I jokingly call it as well. What you get is a pretty authentic experience with some really simple and delicious Mexican food (think meat, rice, beans, sauce).   We pulled in late (~10 PM) to grab a quick dinner and ended up sitting outside on the patio. They have a decent drink menu to go along with their expansive food menu (also be sure to check out the menu full of photographs for a few kicks) and I ended up getting a 32 oz sugar creek pale ale that was on special - I soon realized my mistake when the massive glass hit the table as I don't do math well (almost 3 beers!) after 10 PM. We ended up splitting a fajitas plate as the portions are huge and even I couldn't finish one myself.   The staff is always super friendly. I had flashbacks to our travels to central america as the waiter's common responses come in Spanish and he tolerated/helped me with my poor broken Spanish. There is a bit of a culture gap here, so you may have to work to get your bill. I ended up closing up at the front due to the late hour and they were closing down.   All in all - a fun place to go and grab a simple but tasty meal!",

Guacamole is good but expensive because they make it tableside . Chips are just meh. Waiters and Waitresses are very nice.

The salsa for the chips was the same red sauce with some onions and cilantro.  Flavorless, worthless.  This place sucks",

At one point in the past, they have a station in the restaurant in the front that they make tortillas from scratch. But since they gotten soo popular and demand is high that it's impossible to make it from scratch up front.   I ordered the shrimp fajitas with corn tortillas. I really really like it.. The green and red peppers with the onions were perfect. The shrimps was not overcooked and plenty of it.. Corn tortillas came warm.. My company ordered chicken fajitas and 3 beef hard shell tacos. They finished their meal and smiling so I'm assuming it must be good. We were starving so there wasn't much talking at all.   The gentleman that was waiter did his job. Did his thing! I wouldn't say he was on top of thing but he manage.. But he wasn't bad either!!   Overall I would love to go back and try a few more things on the menu. But knowing me, I'll get the shrimp fajitas again!",

    "text": "I was a little wary about this place. From the outside, it looks super sketch because the restaurant is semi-attached to a Days Inn. It's awkwardly positioned to the right of the hotel. But hey, sometimes that's where you get the most authentic food.  Walking in, that's when I realized, it was very cultured and decked out. I felt like I walked into an Aztecan temple filled with golden chairs/walls/tables, you name it. It may have been the color of the wood and the light that was shining just right. I felt like I needed to offer a human heart in return for my food. But we'll save that for another time ;)  The menu, like any traditional mexican restaurant was expansive. Average price around $7-12, so pretty good. I think there were over 60 items on the menu. I ultimately chose the Avocado Tostada and an enchilada. My friend got 2 tacos and an enchilada. While we were waiting for our food, the chips and salsa came out. Chips were the same as any mexican restaurant, however the salsa came with two different types: a cabbage blend and the regular salsa. The cabbage salsa was unique and sweet. Usually cabbage is bitter but it was rather pleasant. We also ordered some queso to go with the chips.   I would say the only caveat about this place was the service. It was a bit slow and forgetful. We ordered the queso and we didn't receive it until we got our meal (which was 20 minutes after we ordered). Water refill was slow if not at all (we had to hail down our waiter). Let me tell you though, it was alot of queso, so definitely your money's worth. When we got our food, it was served on this gigantic plate (~20 inches wide). The food was spread out, but it was still alot of food. Avocado tostada was a bit disappointing as I only got 2 small chunks of avocado.  Regardless, the experience was amazing. We got sopapillas at the end. It's essentially fried chips with a sprinkle of strawberry drizzle and powdered sugar. Nice way to polish off the lunch. Til next time amigos.",

I found out later that it's a favorite of many of my food-loving friends. There were chips on the table within minutes of sitting down, salsa and coleslaw as well, though I would have liked a bit more salsa in the bowl and it was bland.   My husband ordered the burrito especial and myself the enchiladas suizas (green). My plate was larger than I've ever seen for one person. The enchilada portion was two large and the plate was filled with rice, beans, and slaw. I loved the rice and beans most! The verde sauce was also lacking in flavor, some heat would have been nice. My husband was completely pleased with his meal and is already planning our next visit. He even finished off my plate and left ready for a nap. For about $20 we left full following excellent service.",

For being in North Carolina, thousands of miles from the border, this is pretty darn authentic by my standards!    It's a Sunday afternoon and the place is packed with hispanic families!  That's an automatic one star for me!!!  This usually means the food will be more homemade type Mexican food and less commercial like you would get at a Carlos O'Kelley's type place.  Then the guacamole cart comes around and fresh guacamole is made at your table!!  And BAM!  There's three stars!  The guacamole was AMAZING!!!  You get to pick all of the ingredients as well as how spicy you would like it.    Then our orders of chile verde, a heaping ceviche (complete w Tapatio) and a combo plate of an enchilada and avocado tostada comes out just as we finish the guacamole!  Four stars!!!  The food is delicious, the wait staff is helpful and prompt.  Just when we realized we couldn't stuff out faces with one more bite, out came a perfect-sized portion of buenelos type dessert with strawberry sauce FOR FREE!!!!  And before you know it we are at FIVE STARS!    We ate at El Charo in the same area a couple of nights ago and they don't come close to Azteca!!!  So ignore all of the stars El Charo got and go to AZTECA!!!!",

The best thing about the place is the fast service. You could do better... you could do worse, but  you owe it to yourself to try some place different if you believe Azteca is \"great\" or even \"above average\".",

I had a combo plate of a taco and an a cheese enchilada with rice and beans, it was enormous and only about $7, I also had a giant peach margarita that was delicious.  That cost more than my meal ($8 I think?) but I had a rough day and it was worth every penny.    Consensus - cheap, decent mexican food a short drive from my apartment.  Sold.",

There was a little man walking around with a make shift cart offering tableside guac. A little odd and pricey. $6 for one avocado or $8 for two...hmmm...ok. Not bad for price of tableside guac if the portion matched the price, which it did not.  Ordered the combo place of tostada, enchilada and taco. Came with typical rice and beans. The portion was HUGE! Could barely finish it and had to wait to start it because it was so hot. Hot like it was sitting under the lamp too long. Flavors were just ok.   All in all, decent, though not a place I'll likely return considering all the other good Mexican restaurants around town.",

I'm starting to think the trend is that the worse looking the outside facade, the better the food & prices are. This Azteca may not have the best Mexican food, but it's pretty good, especially for the price.  Nothing really stands out to me about any of the lunch plates I've gotten, but I just know I leave very full. The place is a tad bit on the smaller side, with some odd booth arrangements, so expect a wait if you go during the lunch hustle & bustle. It can also be a pain getting in & out of the parking lot but it's well worth it.  Azteca is a lot more popular than you'd think from 1st look, but there's a reason people keep going back & waiting for tables during lunch. You'll leave full without hitting the wallet too hard.",

One of my favorite dishes they serve is the Carnitas Des Reyes (I think that's how it's spelled!)!  Sliced beef strips in a tomato-ey sauce with green peppers and onions.  Served with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, rice, beans and guacamole.  The beef is so tender and has a ton of flavor.  If you've never tried it before, please do!  If you like fajitas, you would like that dish!  I've also had their fajitas and they are the best around!  I don't think I've had a bad meal there.    Service is always great and fast, especially at lunch time.  Oh, and at the end of your meal you get these wedges of tortillas dusted with sugar and drizzled with honey and strawberry sauce, topped with whipped cream!  One of my favorite desserts ever and you get it with your meal!  Yum!!  Don't let the fact that it's attached to a Days Inn make you not want to go in.

Was here for dinner with my wife and was greeted with smiling staff, you do have options to sit out and have food but I preferred sitting indoors. The chips and salsa were good, but not anything extra ordinary. The dinner portions of fajitas and one more dish(forgot the name) were more than enough to make you full so be sure if you are bigger groups to not order too much. The taste was good, liked the freshness of the veggies and the chicken was well fried and all items were served hot. The tortillas were hot and were freshly made. This is a must go if you like Mexican food and with so much Mexican families coming to this restaurant, as I could see from the crowd, am pretty sure this is closest to the authentic taste they have in Charlotte.

Azteca was the fourth one that we tried and, finding it open, decided to give it a try.  When we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  There was a plate of food on display which looked kind of congealed and gross - it had probably been there the whole day - and made me question whether dinner there was a good idea.  There was no wait for our table.  When we were seated, they promptly brought us delicious chips and salsa.  Our waitress was very kind.  We ordered four different dishes and shared - they were all fabulous.  Large portions for great prices.  There was also a woman walking by with a cart making fresh guacamole on request.  She was adorable and I loved that she made it right in front of us.  Overall, Azteca was not a place I probably would have chosen first but I'm really glad we stumbled upon it.  A great find!",

Initially I was concerned the patio would be full since every time we drive by its crowded. Thankfully, it was pretty empty! Lucky us.  First off, the service is pretty poor. They weren't very friendly when we were asking/waiting to be seated. Second, we had to ask several times for more chips since they only put about 10 chips to each basket. The longer we waited, the harder the bowl of queso we ordered got. In the first 30 minutes we waited 15 minutes for more chips and a refill on our drink. We finally got our food and, not surprisingly, the order was wrong. We just sucked it up and didn't say anything since we figured it would take another 30 minutes for them to correct it.  Overall, food is about 4-stars, but the service was at best a 1.5. I'll be generous and give Azteca 2 stars.",

I was seated immediately in the restaurant and received a menu, my chips and saulsa and my drink order was taken.    I ordered the Pollo Crema and guacamole.  Soon after I received my ice cold draught beer and a waiter came to my table and prepared the guacamole to order using a fresh avacado, onions, tomatoes and celantro. My only disappointment is I ordered a small portion instead of the large.  Moments later the entree was served on a huge dish full of rice and beans with my chicken.  The cream sauce was rich and eating it along with the guacamole was to die for.    The server was exceptional too and he frequently checked to ensure the food was good, my beverage was full and chips were aplenty.  I have eaten Mexican food from coast to coast and this was by far the best I've ever had.",

The dining area has a warm and inviting feel.  Festive music can be heard but not too loud.  After being greeted by a waiter in traditional garb they immediately brought us their house chips which are light and crispy and they'll bring as many as you can eat.    The salsa is watery, chunky, lacks any kick and I didn't find the pico de gallo appetizing either.  But the guacamole is made fresh table-side by a charming woman who doesn't speak much but smiles a lot.  You get to choose how spicy and whether you want onions, cilantro, lime, or all of the above.  She then muddles it in a stone serving dish and lets you taste-test it before she sets it on your table and moves on.  The ground beef tacos are too greasy.  But the flank steak in the Tacos al Carbon is sublime compared to the other items I've tried so far.  The menu is huge so there are still plenty of items to try on return visits.  For the value and down home atmosphere it's a great alternative to the other high (snooty) and low (scary) Mexican restaurants around town.",

No.  That doesn't exist in Charlotte.  About the only thing I dislike is their parking--very crowded (and yes, weird parking at the motel).  Other than that, I say \"give 'em a whirl!\"",

We just got back from Mexico, so it was nice to see some authentic art and hear authentic music again. The place was not busy when we went, and initially, service was fast. We got our drinks and chips right away. Then after saying we needed a minute, we got about 10 before someone came to take our order. No one checked on us during the meal.   The food was good, not the best Mexican, not the worst. The salsa is a little watered down, but I liked it. I got a quesadilla and hubs got fajitas. Both portions were huge. After dinner they bring a little fried pastry for a sweet bite on the house.   For a casual Mexican meal, Azteca did the trick. I would come back.",

Do yourself a favor and drive the 2 miles out of South End, away from the trendy instagram Mexican spots that are popping up, and give this gem a try. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but I'd argue the fajitas are a must try for any first timer. Delicious salsa/pico de gallo, rice and beans, and margaritas.

They try and turn tables and it is not a good customer experience.  As for the food, the salsa is runny and the cabbage slaw always has a rancid flavor. As for entrees, nothing really stands out. Most recently I got the fajitas and the Chicken wasn't great and the vegetables were even cooked. The beans and rice are okay but I feel like they sit on the plates and get heated up right before being served. Half the time the rice a overcooked because of that. I will say the fresh made guacamole is good. Definitely don't pass that up. Drinks are not fresh...the Margarita tastes like a pre-made mix, very sour. Learn to make a fresh Margarita.  There are definitely better Mexican options in my mind and probably will not return.",

    "text": "I haven't been to Azteca in probably a decade, but I was in Charlotte last Sunday and ate there this weekend. It was good. Just like I remembered - with their chips and salsa, they also served some vinegar based cole slaw that I forgot about until I started eating it again. Good stuff. The booth that I and my friend sat in was tight and we felt claustrophobic (we are bigger guys who need a bit more room). They should widen the booths we sat in by at least 5 inches or take out one of the booths and reorganize the booth area. It really did seem tight, unless you are a really skinny family. In retrospect, we should have asked to switch to a table.  The food was just as I remembered it. Well above average and the portions were just as good. I love hot salsa and was disappointed that asking for extra hot salsa costs $3 more.   I'm vegetarian and asked if the macho burrito (a burrito that has cactus, rice, beans and other veggies in it) had refried beans or whole black beans in it and was told it had the black beans in it. Being told it had whole black beans in it, I ordered it. However, it had both refried beans and whole black beans. The problem I have with this is that most Mexican restaurants don't understand that lard (pig fat) is quite often an ingredient of refried beans. A few bites in, I realized there were refried beans in this burrito. I didn't feel like causing a problem and decided to assume they knew what vegetarian meant and since their menu said it was vegetarian, the refried beans are actually vegetarian. Next time I go, I will ask more questions or order it without refried beans. By the way, this burrito is HUGE. You will not walk away hungry.   Service was pretty good. I did have to wait about 5 minutes between receiving the check and paying for it. I wasn't in a hurry and the restaurant was really full of people, so that wasn't a big issue with me.   Overall, I can recommend this restaurant. It's a good step above a standard Mexican restaurant. You will get good food here.",

The choices they have are endless. You cant go wrong with anything that comes with their refried beans and rice, it is LIFE. Margaritas are great. Its my tradition to come here every cinco de mayo (get their early, its everybody else's idea too), but they always have shirts with a margarita purchase every cinco de mayo and it makes the experience that much more fun.

    "text": "Came to Azteca after a day of shopping in the area and made a last minute change to our dinner plans. Our group wasn't very keen on fast food so we picked a restaurant near our hotel and settled quickly on Azteca. In retrospect, we should have read reviews before deciding on this restaurant. Chips and dip were served when we sat down but instead of red and white sauce we got red sauce and Cole slaw. Kind of interesting for a Mexican restaurant. My dining companion had chicken fajitas, I had the chicken taco salad. The fajitas were very well prepared and the chicken was delicious. The taco salad was not very good. Chicken tasted funny and was served with cheddar cheese instead of the typical Mexican cheese which mixed differently with the chicken. Overall, I would not return to this restaurant but it wasn't too terrible for a last minute late meal.",

    "text": "We chose this restaurant based on it's proximity to the hotel plus it's status on YELP and couldn't have been more pleased. The food and service here were nothing short of amazing. I couldn't decide what to order because the selection was ginormous and chose a combination place consisting of 1 enchilada, 1 chili relleno and a hard taco with rice, beans and their famous slaw. The cost for this ... on the largest plate I've ever seen ... was only $9.99. AMAZING! I had plenty to take home and devour later, which always makes me happy. There is a table side guacamole cart that is nothing short of incredible that you absolutely have to partake of. We ordered ours with all of the ingredients and couldn't help making the 'mmmmm' sound with the first bite. I never considered cilantro in making guacamole.  We ordered the small and it was plenty for the two of us.  We also treated ourselves to a pitcher of margaritas. The price for this HUGE pitcher was $25 and would have been a sufficient amount for 4 people. The two of us overindulged .. ;) .. and had plenty left over that we had to leave behind on the table. It seemed such a waste of the best margaritas (the ingredients were perfectly proportioned) that I have had in a long time. Actually thinking of coming back here before I leave Charlotte. OUTSTANDING.",

    "text": "Absolutely terrible service! Yes, they seat you quickly, but the menus were thrown on the table and the server just left. Didn't ask if we wanted a drink or anything. They actually didn't say a word to us. The waiter took forever to serve us and never came to check on us to see if we wanted or needed anything else. I really wish I could have gotten his name, but maybe it helps for the establishment to know that we visited on 2/25/2017 around 8:30pm and sat directly across from the kitchen. When the waiter finally came back we asked for the check and waited a long time again for him to come back to the table. We were ready to leave and late for a meeting with some other people, so we decided to go to the counter to pay, but wow, he sure was quick that time to come to our table to tell us to pay at the table after waiting a lifetime for him to show up! Apparently, he thought we were trying to leave without paying! I was livid and have never been treated like that before! Good Lord! We didn't want to spend the night there!       I came here upon recommendation from some of our employees who like to eat here, but it is definitely not a place I care to ever visit again and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone that I know. We were treated like dirt! It doesn't help that it is also located in a sketchy part of town. The only thing good I can say about this place is that the food was OK.       If you are interested in great tasting Mexican food in a better area with better service, try Salsas in Steele Creek. Better service, better & safer location and a more pleasant staff. There are also many things to do nearby that you can walk to, safely.",

I met my two best friends for what has become an annual before Christmas craziness dinner.    Azteca does have the best pico de gallo of any other place and our queso was delicious as well. My friends enjoyed to very delicious margaritas while I drank a cold Negro Medelo.   Dinner is where I found my self a bit disappointed.  We all ordered combination plates, mine was the taco with ground beef.  Our service was slow for the night and my plate arrived warm with one side of my corn tortilla taco completely soggy.    We had a very long wait for our checks which were split incorrectly and there was further confusion about how my one friend's visa was charged.  The waiter was was very appologetic and the situarion was resolved, but very awkward.  I am a great fan of Azteca, and I chalk this visit up to an off night.",

For the Southeast, this place is above average.  First: salsa is ok. Pretty watery but good flavor. Chips seem house made-also good.   The \"slaw\" is very good. It's basically ceviche with no meat.   I ordered carnitas. Pork of course-they offer beef and chicken carnitas, which is weird. The portions are very large and come on a huge plate. Rice and beans were as expected (surprisingly they are sub-par at a lot of places-not here). Carnitas normally are hewn from a large roast (can be fried). They serve 1\"cubes. Not really traditional. Pretty good flavor, but if you like carnitas, these won't satisfy. Served with pickled onions. Good but odd. Should be lots of fresh onions and cilantro.  Also, there was more slaw, and excellent nopal (cactus) salad. Corn tortillas were store bought, probably all that is avail here.  Guacamole is good, but not enough provided. Overall good, but I would order something different next time",

    "text": "The pros:  - Good service.  The hostess was friendly and seated me promptly.  Though my friend hadn't arrived yet, there was no prob to get a table and wait at the the table.  Throughout dinner our server was courteous and quick.  We also had, who I think is a manager, check on us a couple of times, and made sure we were ok.  - Fresh guac - As Dave S. pointed out (and thank you for the rec on this place!) there's a guy that goes table to table and offers fresh guac.  We sampled a bit and really liked it, so he served us a fresh bowl of it.  It's creamy, fresh, and very good!  - Basket of tortilla chips and salsa - The tortilla chips are right out of the oven, and are warm & crispy to perfection.  They serve them with a small bowl of salsa and a small plate of salad.  It took a lot of self control to not inhale the whole thing!  The cons:  - Few vegetarian/vegal options - The menu only has about three things to select if you're vegetarian and/or vegan.  Also my cheese enchillada was very bland and was brought out without any sauce on it, which was kind of odd.  I've had cheese enchilladas at so many other Mexican restaurants and they always serve it with salsa verde or standard red salsa, in this case I had to ask for a side bowl of red salsa.  - Mariachi Band - Ok, they're not a total \"negative\" but it was a little distracting having them blast their music at our table right when my friend showed up.  We hadn't seen each other in 2 years and were ready to catch up but all we could do was shout at each other b/c the band chose to perform right at our table.  As soon as we answered their request of what type of song to play, and they played a good chearful piece, and after we tipped them, they left, then we could actually eat and talk without raising our voices.  But the music was good and they were a nice group, so it's not all bad, just not great timing on their part.  Verdict:  I'd probably go back here if I was in the area, but not likely to go out of my way.",

He directed me to Azteca, and told me not to worry about the fact it was connected with a Days Inn.  That was 8 years ago, and after trying numerous Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, Azteca remains far and away our favorite. The food is delicious and the portions are huge for the price you pay. Service is always friendly and prompt. The restaurant is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always a fun place to hang out.   The mariachi band that plays on the weekend is a blast. On one of our last visits, they asked us if we wanted them to play us a song. We said sure, but we didn't know which one, so we suggested they play us their favorite song. They chose Elvis, which cracked us up.  My husband loves the Arroz con Pollo. I switch around dishes, but lately my favorite is the Pork Carnitas. For $11, you get a plate with so much food on it that taking home leftovers is a must. We've had nothing but great visits to Azteca!",

Not spicy, as in just came off the grill let it cool hot.    Once I regained feeling in my tongue I enjoyed my meal. I had a combo with tacos and a quesadilla.

My favorite is the churros, they're delicious and a huge portion. The only thing we have had that we weren't a fan of was the chicken nachos. They were tasteless and soggy by the time we got the pick up to our house.  When ordering pick up, always check your bag, they get the orders mixed up quite a lot but are happy to fix it.

It's one of the better options in Charlotte for quick Mexican food, but it's still not a great option.

I have only come to this spot for lunch, but I've never been disappointed. Their service is spot on, and their food is always hot and delicious! They do have different lunch specials each day and a whole menu section dedicated to lunch items. Every meal comes with chips and salsa, as well as a vinegar based slaw. I've ordered different lunch items and have enjoyed each one. I will say their rice is never anything to write home about, but I think it's more of a \"plate filler\" than anything else. Their refried beans are really tasty, and are a great compliment to all their tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas.   If you're in the neighborhood, you should definitely pop in and check this place out. They know how to bring in a lunch crowd!",

This past Friday night at the Woodlawn Azteca was very memorable, for all of the right reasons.  My boyfriend and I showed up around 7pm on Friday night - prime dinner time in Charlotte. We had been in Asheville last weekend and had become begrudgingly accustomed to hearing \"Oh, an hour...hour and a half, maybe,\" upon asking how long the wait for a table would be, so when the host at Azteca seated us immediately, we could have both cried from happiness.   Our table was in the back of the restaurant, so we had a great view of the night's festivities - and festivities is what they were. There was live music - a 5-piece band, wandering the restaurant. It was so fun! The whole atmosphere felt like a Friday night party.   Service was fast and friendly. Table-side guacamole was made for us the second we sat down, and my margarita arrived in record time. My boyfriend ordered one of his favorite Mexican dishes (for the life of me, I can't remember what it was called - it was chicken and stir-fry veggies with spicy rice) and I opted for the chicken flautas, which were crispy and flavorful and absolutely delicious. It was a perfect, huge, satisfying meal.  Our waiter was hilarious and adorable and made us feel like his only table, despite the restaurant being at capacity. I could not have asked for a more perfect date night!",

I got a ground beef chalupa and it wasn't the best I ever had or anything but it was good. The chips and salsa are always so addictive at any Mexican restaurant but the salsa here was a bit runny which I don't typically go for. I really enjoyed their queso dip and using it on not only the chips but my rice and refried beans as well. All in all eating as Azteca wasn't bad by any means.",

But umm.. we didn't know what song to request so we asked for a \"happy\" song haha (I guess I should brush up on my latin songs beforehand next time lol) They were so sweet! Near the end of our meal, they came back to ask if we would like another. Of course we said YES! Don't forget to tip btw :)  There was a birthday party beside us and the servers embarrass the birthday girl/boy with a sombrero hat as the mariachi band gathers with birthday songs :) It is a great place for birthdays.

We have been here over an hour and still have not been sat and have had all of our party for 45 minutes. Bar service is awful as well. The guy totally forgot two of our drinks and didn't listen when we told us to split it. Never coming back and still haven't even eaten.

I have dissonance around finding a good restaurant attached to a mid-range hotel.   When you walk in, it's like walking in a little tunnel. The front area is really small too and if you arrive with a lot of people, your personal space bubble becomes almost non-existent. We asked for a booth and yes, the tables are very close together. The staff are friendly and they especially warm-up if you speak Spanish.   We ordered the \"Macho\" and veggie fajitas. Very good and large portions! We also ordered the fresh guacamole since many of the previous reviews raved about this. Even though it was delicious, I thought it was a tad pricey ($7 for one avocado) after thinking it was only $3 (I guess I mis-read the menu). The salsa was on the watery side and I'm accustomed to the chunkier, but it was still good.   As we were leaving, a table was having a birthday and it was such a fun site to see! Most of the staff came out singing and sombreros in hand. At the end of the birthday song, one of the waiters got up on a chair and was pretending to do a little strip-tease with his apron. Hilarious.   Good food, good fun...and if you are lucky, you'll witness a birthday celebration!",

Order salsa verde with chips Get the tortilla soup.   So good and hearty.   It's a meal.   Grande beer is best bang for buck.   2.5 beers in one mug.    We usually share one and get out the door cheap.   LOVE this place.",

    "text": "The entrees are okay but have a salt taste. The tables are tile-topped so the tile grout collects dirt and germs. I have been in better Mexican places where the tops are custom and very colorful however they have a piece of glass or Lexan over top of them to keep the eating surface clean. Last time I was in here there were 2 kids running around their table and the adults, including the waitresses didn't care one bit that my ears were ringing from screaming. I guess that is an occasional part of the \"authentic\" experience. The prices are a bit high for the quality of the food. The food isn't horrible, but it is really just average. People rave about this place, even going as far as saying its the best Latino food they've ever had, even traveling to Latino countries. I don't get it. One of the same yelling children was licking the top of a salt shaker in front of the adults and wait staff, nobody seemed to care. I had to tell the waitress to probably remove that salt shaker since the little girl was licking it. Beware salt shakers at this place with clogged tops, it may be from dried saliva. The place has a nice decor but overall they stay so busy (again, I am baffled as to why) and that causes the cleanliness of the place to be below average. Wait staff is friendly however can be too long between table visits, and then when at the table once can be pushy. Unfortunately I will come back as my girl and her family say its the best, driving 40 minutes from home in SC to come here. I have eaten Mexican food my whole life, authentic and otherwise, and this place to me is average at best. Not positively memorable in terms of deliciousness, cleanliness or value. Yes you get a lot of beans and rice with the food but that's like going to Thanksgiving at someones house and bragging about the portions because half your plate was piled with Stove Top. If my experience here improves, I will be sure to apologize and update my rating, but after 3 or 4 visits, I am doubtful.",

But this time the whole family got together and I chose Azteca, thinking it wouldn't be \"too\" badly crowded.  Well, it was full, but SO festive and fun!  We sat at the bar while we waited for our table for 7, and the bartender was entertaining and quick with our margaritas, even making a little virgin margarita for the youngster with us.  We got our table fairly quickly, and we kept our waiter entertained and coming back and forth pretty quickly, too, considering the room was full of party groups.  As always, the food was filing and delicious!  This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, and it was really good to be back, and share it with 3 in our party who had never been.

If you are like me, I had to pack the rest for to-go. I believe waiting for our food, while loading up on their salsa/guacamole sauce + chips, really got me. Don't scrimp on the guacamole, it's good!  The tamales/enchilada combo was what I had ordered. Although, the shredded beef tamale was not wrapped in the corn shuck, which takes the fun out of unwrapping your tamales.  Enchilada looked messy, but surprisingly good!! Overall, I'd come back, when I feel for Mexican.  Service - good and attentive.  No complaints here.  Place - you get a good Aztecan vibe!   **Cinco de Mayo is coming up, order their house margarita, you get a free shirt!",

Came here at the start of 2014 with a friend to catch up on a busy December, but made it difficult to talk bc the restaurant was such an issue.  Trying to get the attention of a waiter, waiting on tortillas while the fajita plate got cold, and drinks empty for most of the time.    I'm probably done here.

After eating all of the chips and salsa, I ended up being able to bring home 2 fajitas.  I didn't get the table side guac, but I saw it made for 2 different tables nearby and it looked great. They also lowered the price from what some people are reviewing...$6.95 for one avocado and $8.95 for 2.  Great place to grab some delicious Mexican food.

Oh well, at least the chips were good and warm and service was fast and friendly. I asked the waiter for suggestions and went with the arroz con pollo expecting a bland Americanized version. Looking around, most of the patrons were Mexican families, a good sign. The plate was the size of a medium pizza and overflowing with food. More like a stew, the entree was huge, full of flavor. The best I've had by far. Authentic Mexican. Outstanding.",

The restaurant wasn't very busy maybe 8 to 12 people in the dining room, but there was no wait staff to be seen, after waiting more than 10 mins for someone to acknowledge our presence my husband decided to grab the closest waiter and asked him to help us. Instead of being apologetic for making us wait, because he had already taken and returned with a drink order of a couple that came in after us, he was rude and snapped stating \"I am coming now!\" and we told him what we would like to drink and before he left I asked him if we could go ahead and place our dinner order(since we had been waiting a long time already and had more than enough time to look over the menu) and he reluctantly said yes. Ok I've lived here in Charlotte all of my life and I've been eating here since I can remember, I ordered one of my usuals chicken chimichanga no onions please, when the waiter quickly spoke up and said I could not order chicken chimichangas without onions... Wait? What?  So in order to avoid what was already to be a very bad dining experience. I just excused ourselves and left... Im very disapointed with Azteca.. And I can't say I will never return but in the years I have been eating there I've had slow service but this was blatently rude and unwilling to accomodate...",

The chimichanga that I ordered had nothing on top of it when I had asked for everything that it came with except for the sour cream. There was a tiny little dab of guacamole on the side, virtually no lettuce, no tomatoes, and the rice and beans were so flavorless that I could've made it better tasting for myself at home. Next time I'll walk across the street to Sabor Latin Street Grill where they have much better food with much better flavor and a much lower price. Will not be coming back here again.",

And if you find yourself not a fan of this watery red liquid, well to bad. Because, you are about to see that exact red sauce on every plate that comes out. That's right, enchiladas covered in the \"salsa\" , burritos drenched, fajitas swimming in it....they put it on everything with a shameless pride. Also beware Saturday nights, it is Spanish karaoke night, and the music \"horns mostly\" are turned up to ear splitting levels. A request to turn it down and be able to hear the person across the table, will be met with a smile and an \"okay\" without any results. Send three people and it'll still be a smile and an \"okay\" ...which is how I would feel if the manager came up and asked me how my meal was. (Smile) \"it's okay\"",

Not sure what happened tonight but service was just as slow as the business. I left super unhappy and upset.  When we got there the hostess seat us in the bar area. Table was really small since there was 3 of us and a newborn. It took about 10 mins before someone even came to take our drink order and food order. It also took forever for our food to come out. Had to wait also for our drinks to be refilled. Asked twice for more salsa since they only gave 1 small bowl for 3 ppl to share and that didn't come till after our food hit the table. Which then it wasn't needed. Our whole dinning experience took an 1hr and 45mins. At the end of our meal we got tired of waiting for our missing server to give us the check so we had to go up front to the rude hostess to pay.  Your servers and hostess need to be train on customer service. The food was good but service was horrible. I will never return to this location.",

We each ordered a drink - I had a margarita (fairly good, had better!) and he had a draft beer (Modelo - can't go wrong!)   At first the service was fairly good - we quickly received water and the drinks that we had ordered from the bar, but then after that it was like we were nonexistent.   We ordered cheese dip that took forever to come out (very nice portion size I might add though). Their salsa taste like marinara sauce and its watery- it's horrible. However, their hot salsa (upon request) is great though, if you haven't tried it- and care for spicy-it's wonderful!  We sat and waited for almost 25 minutes when I finally got up and found our waiter and told them we were ready to order. Then by that time we sat for another 30 minutes waiting on our food when they weren't even that busy!   The food it's self was pretty good though, I had chicken fajitas and the seasoning on the fajitas part was great! My boyfriend had a chicken quesadilla and he really enjoyed.   However, at the end of the night when it was all said and done we decided that we wouldn't be back here unless we were in a pinch for something quick. We decided that there were other Mexican restaurants with better customer service in Charlotte!",

Kind of baffled, we were like okay.... Then as we left there were barely a few people waiting. Guess I should've ordered desert or a post dinner drink so that maybe they would have allowed us to sit and visit for the amount of time we chose. I didn't think this was a very good way to treat a long time good customer, Or any customer.

Sure- this is your typical Mexican joint, but the atmosphere, speedy service where they really cater to you, and the price is where this place sets itself apart. I got the Don Juan entree with chicken, and I had plenty to bring home. The chicken in this dish is worth the price as it's not the dried out shredded chicken in most other plates. The mushroom flavor was evident but reminded me too much of my favorite canned Cream of Mushroom.  The chips and salsa were flowing, the mariachi band kept the patrons moving, and the food was plentiful.  I'll come here anytime I need a fix of quick and tasty Mexican food.",

    "text": "I went to Azteca this Christmas for lunch. As you would guess, dining options for lunch on this day are few and far between. I drove past the restaurant, noticed there were about 15 cars there, and being familiar with the chain with other locations in Charlotte, said \"what the heck,\" and pulled in.  This time around I got the Fajita Nachos with steak (you can also order it with chicken), and asked the server to add lettuce and jalapenos. She was polite, asked how my holidays were going, and did a great job making sure that I had everything I needed throughout the time I was there. All of the toppings were fresh, the chips were still warm, and the mixture of everything was just about perfect. What I was most impressed with was the taste of the steak. I believe they marinate the steak, and that gives the meat a certain sweetness that ties everything together. If I could make one suggestion, I would be to maybe cut down a little bit on the amount of green/red peppers that are in the recipe.  Overall, I was very happy with my choice on where to eat Christmas Day lunch. It's a meal that your expectations are somewhat high on, but it's so easy to be let down because of the number of options. The only reason I'm not giving this Azteca 5 stars is because of the salsa that's served as an appetizer, as they do at all Mexican restaurants. It's mediocre at best. The salsa they serve lacks texture, and almost resembles a salsa that has been watered down, with green onions added. If my memory serves me correctly, I wasn't impressed with the salsa that other Azteca restaurants in Charlotte served.  Oh yeah, ask for their homemade house hot sauce! It's a type of salsa verde that made up for their red salsa that's served with the tortilla chips.",

    "text": "Holy mole!  This is some good Mexican food!  Probably not the most authentic in the world but still mighty tasty.  I've never eaten anything bad here and for a while, my bf and I were on an every weekend Azteca cycle.  I love fresh guacamole and they actually have a woman who comes by your table with all the ingredients on a cart who makes it right there in front of you.  You can even pick what ingredients you want more or less of.....light onions, extra tomatoes for me please!   We told our friends who have lived here for a while that we went to eat there and they had one word for it, \"Epic!\"  It may not be THAT good, but for queso dip, tacos, and fajitas it's an excellent.  Full bar, margaritas, and a decent beer selection.  An added bonus: the refried beans are actually slightly spicy and tasty, not brown mush out of a can.",

    "text": "ARROZ CON POLLO!!!!  This place is worth it great staff, great atmosphere, awesome food even down to the little tortilla wit whipped cream and strawberry sauce at the end of the meal. The guy that comes around with the guacamole cart makes killer guacamole. The portions are massive I consider myself a big eater and I have a hard time finishing my meal. The staff is great they come into my store after hours and are just as friendly at that time as they are when at work so I guess that means they are sincere. Great place",

This place is large so you rarely have to wait to be seated, even on the weekends.  Everything I've eaten here is fantastic, and I have never been able to eat all the food that I'm served.  The best part is that they serve you free sopapillas (tortilla chips with whipped cream, cinammon, and strawberry sauce) with your check.",

    "text": "Finally, I got to see what table-side guac was!  And it was so cool!  The lady comes out and asked if we wanted one or two (two is gigantic!) and then has all the spices (onions, tomato, jalapeno, etc.) and you tell them exactly how much or how little you want and you taste it until it's exactly how you want it.  Awesome experience!  The food is True to Mexican form, which is hard to find, I'm always finding Tex-Mex around here and you get HUGE portions for the price.  The plate is almost 2 feet wide.  I've never seen such a large portion.  We had the jumbo tableside guac, extra chips and salsa (which unfortunately it's not bottomless chips there :( ), 2 combo platters with 2 tacos and an enchilada, rice, beans, and cole slaw, and a complimentary dessert which they throw in like Chinese restaurants throw in fortune cookies (which was yummy) all for less than $30, plus the servings were so big I had a lot to take home.  I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes real Mexican.  I've only been able to find On the Border around here for tolerable Mexican, but I think this may beat it.  They gave us different types of salsas too.  Even the cole slaw style was good.  I wasn't really a fan of the bland one, too watery, but the second one they gave was great.  They have outside seating which was relaxing.  I wish it wasn't next to a Days Inn, but I didn't see any shady characters running around.  The bathrooms could be a little cleaner tho.",
