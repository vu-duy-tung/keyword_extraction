We set our reservation online and were quite pleased with the table setting / private room that awaited us. Marvin introduced himself as our server and he was amazing: great service, impeccable recommendations and great humor. We loved him. The food was excellent. Most of us ordered from the lunch menu (a great deal) and got the hamburger. But I ordered the stuffed chicken for a buck more (no pun intended)' and it was the best chicken I ever had. Period. We would like to turn it into a once a month thing at minimum. Excellent food and service and reasonable lunch prices for the quality. Highly recommend.",

Even better, at the end of your meal, the server has your car brought around so you don't have to wait. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and told by the apologetic manager there was a minor delay in seating us...turns out, when the reservation was made, they asked if this dinner was a celebration (our anniversary) and asked our favorite drinks- the delay was getting those drinks on the table fresh from the bar. NICE touch RC!  Our British waiter was wonderful, sharing the background of RC and offering advice on certain dishes after inquiring as to our preferences. We both had steak. Sizziling, fork tender, delicious steak. Cooked to perfection. A perfect cut. My husband loooved the creamed spinach, I enjoyed the potatoes (my hips, maybe notsomuch). Our glasses were never empty. Empty dishes never lingered....and ya, they were empty b/c we pretty much scarfed down everything.  I'm very fortunate, I've dined at some of the country's best establishments and I can honestly say RC holds it's own in service and food in a more comfortable, inviting atmosphere.",

    "text": "I took my almost husband here for his birthday last weekend. I'll openly admit I am a bit of food snob when entering into an establishment of this type. We did have to wait 20 minutes for a 7:30 reservation (Saturday night) so immediately, I was already a bit put off. We were finally seated at the table at the outside edge of the kitchen doors. Again, unhappy. I wait 20 minutes for a table when I had a reservation and then I get the worst seat in the house? Thanks.   Then along comes our waiter and the night gets better! Fergus. Fergus rocked this. Fergus is Irish born, well spoken, clearly well educated, and provided spot on service and conversation. He knew the menu inside and out. Knew his beers and wines. We could totally hang with Fergus.   The future husband and I don't eat alot (portion wise). So we opted to split the Cowboy Ribeye and take the 3 veggie combo platter for our side. We got the mashed tatos, onion rings and aspargus with holandaise sauce. We also ordered the BBQ Shrimp for an app (friggin YUMMMMMY). The BBQ shrimp was only 5 pieces. Not cool for sharing. Should be 6. Otherwise, I was totally happy with it. Could eat that for days. The Cowboy (21 ounces) ribeye was flawlessy cooked and beautifully seasoned ever so mildly. The mashed were scratch made as was evidenced by the light lumpys within and tasty, just like home. The sauce for the aspargus was a bit too bitter but maybe its a southern thing. The veggies themselves were cooked perfectly. Tender but not soggy. The O rings....mmmmm. They, themselves, were great but they were served on a pool of thai chili sauce. Outstanding.   Overall, the place is a tad over priced on some plates while the rest is quite fair for the quality of the food and service. The above mentioned plates plus 2 glasses of wine and two beers came to about $140. It was what I was expecting when I booked the table.  Great experience overall. Didn't like the treatment at the hostess stand very much. But Fergus more than redeemed the staff rating. The food was excellent with very little complaint at all. The valet was a nice guy. The interior was def a good setting for a romantic dinner. Would I go here again? Yup.",

Under normal circumstances I can't justify spending $100+ on a meal for two people but during restaurant week we were able to get amazing food for almost half the cost.  The customer service was excellent!  They provide free valet and the hostess checked our coats as we walked in the door.  We had to wait an extra 20 minutes on our table even with a reservation, but that can probably be attributed to restaurant week.  Our server was outstanding as they usually are for upscale restaurants.  The restaurant week menu is limited but all I wanted was a filet so I was totally satisfied with the options.  The steak was perfectly cooked and each bite melted in my mouth!  So delicious!  We ordered a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes which were also quite good.  The chocolate sin cake dessert is more like a dark chocolate slice of fudge or flourless cake.  It was very good but not quite what I was expecting.  This is a great place to go to celebrate a special occasion, or if you just don't mind spending a little extra money for a nice meal.",

They have a great wine selection and can offer great recommendations based on what you order. The dessert is amazing!

We're going to do it \"Chopped\" style!  1.Presentation: the filet mignon was still sizzling when brought out (even 10 minutes late the plate was still freaking hot). My plate was very simple since there was only a piece of steak right in the center of the dish. And I received a bowl of mashed potato which was filled to the top (southern style).  2. Taste: ......Marvelous.... after taking the first bite, I thought to myself, \"what have I been eating my whole life?\". Yep, that's how good the steak was. I ordered medium-rare, which I was expecting a steak that once sliced that the juice would come out. I was terribly wrong. Instead, my steak was well aged, which allows the meat to be flavorful and moist. As for the seasoning, I didn't add any! The meat, itself, was seasoned with salts and peppers. So unlike typical southern's steak (thanks god) it wasn't buttery. Though the cheesecake dessert could've been better because it was kind of plain-jane.  Creativity: Obviously everything was simple since they want the steak to be in the spotlight. Which I think was suitable for the restaurant.  Sadly, the only flaw that matter to me is the price. It's not a place that you can go everynight (good god, $40 for a steak) but it's a great place for a special occasion. Such as a date or something along that line. :)",

    "text": "My husband and I went here last night for his birthday (we also had a gift card so it kinda helped make our decision!). We typically don't go to super nice restaurants or chains but we decided to do something a bit more fancy for his birthday.   We had reservations for 7pm. When we arrived we were seated immediately. Fairly quickly, the waiter (Steve) came over and introduced himself and the specials for the night. He was very outgoing! We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizer. A few minutes later he came back and took our order for main food.  Wine: I'm not really a wine snob but I thought the bottle of cab we got was amazing!   Appetizer: Oso Bucco Ravioli- Delish! There were 5 raviolis that came with this appetizer, along with sauted spinach. The butter/wine sauce was so good! Excellent start to the meal!   Main Meal: I got the petite sirloin and my husband got some T-bone steak. My steak came out sizziling in butter....500 degrees to be exact.  My husband's steak came out and was the size of his face....no, seriously, it was! Both our steaks were cooked perfectly. At this point in the night, I was in food heaven. Buttery, juicy, melt in your mouth, steak heaven! We got the broccoli au gratin and the mashed potatoes as sides. Definitely plenty for the two of us. The sides were great but the steaks were fantastic!   Dessert: After finishing our meal and realizing how full we were. We decided dessert was in order....I mean, duh, getting dessert is such an obvious choice after realizing that you are completely suffed!! ;) However, the waiter came out with a white chocolate cheesecake with a candle for my husbands birthday!! It was so sweet that they gave us a free dessert! After the cheesecake, we decided to call it quits.   The manager (Chris) came by a few times to check in on us, which I thought was a great touch.   2 hour long delicious meal with wine spending time with my husband on his birthday = perfection!",

O M G!  Heaven on earth.   Why 5 stars?  Because of the one time the food was not top notch.  Eating in the dining room with my wife and had ordered the large filet.  It was fine  but had one smallish portion of it that was a bit fatty/gristly.  I left that part on the plate but had had plenty of good medium-rare steak to be fully satisfied.  Our waiter came up and saw the small pile and asked if everything was  ok.  I just said there was this little bit that wasn't good but that it was no problem at all.  Next thing we know the Executive Chef is at the table profusely apologizing, saying that cut should not have gone out.  The steak is off the bill and we got two free desserts.  All without really having a complaint.  THAT is commitment to quality and customer loyalty.",

The steaks were cooked properly, and the sides were good. Dessert was alright, but to be honest we were full at that point. The experience wasn't terrible, but not great.

I ordered a ribeye ($43) cooked medium rare with a peppercorn sauce (au poivre) ($4) and served with bread and butter. All this was nicely individually packed but be careful though as I had a bit of leakage. Servers were polite.   The steak itself was definitely quality meat and my first bite was golden.  The steak was definitely cooked to the right temperature.  This is where the review goes downhill. My second peace I tried with the peppercorn sauce which was not appetizing. As a steakhouse I expected the sauce to complement the meat and not mask it entirely. Finally, with each additional bite the meat tasted saltier until I finally just accepted that they had over salted the meat. A bit too salty to enjoy. In addition, there were a lot of chewy pure fat parts to my steak making it difficult to eat and cut--albeit with a plastic knife.",

We had the calamari, filet oscar style cooked medium well, potatoes au gratin, broccoli and crab cakes. The steak came out well done and it was tough because it sat under the heating lamp so long. Again they were not busy so there's no excuse why the steak was overcooked. The crab cakes looked like they were undercooked in the middle. The broccoli was hard and the potatoes au gratin were terrible because the potatoes were cut so thick. Overall it was the worst experience we've ever had at a Ruth's Chris. We will never be coming back to any Ruth's Chris again. If I could give 0 stars I would.  Update: Was sick an hour later. Likely from the undercooked crab cake.",

I love coming here or any RCSH for that matter but this location has  1) Valet 2) Deals  3) Happy Hour  4) Nice decor and appropriately appointed as all other locations (Midwest to the East Coast).   I came because they offer lunch and I never got to have a burger in all the times that I've been but today - help me (insert hand waving)   The Prime Burger was ordered Medium Well - I got something pretty dry.  With cheddar - It was melted down  Pickles - Relish was offered. This was a cute gesture  Onions and Lettuce as requested  No lemons for my water ever arrived  The service wasn't Ruth Chris ready but oh well.  The patty was salty to me.  The bun was hard enough that it cut the roof of my mouth like chips would do. And I appreciate a toasted bun.  The bun seems freshly made and baked nearby, if not on site.   The fries were overcooked as in they were pretty substance free. This made not taking them out pretty easy.   Lawd knows I love some Ruth Chris. The +1 was most upset they didn't have Gumbo on the menu. I'm like just wait for NOLA RCSH for such. I'd try the salmon or stuffed chicken breast for lunch next time.   The bacon on the +1 burger wasn't served as long strips but dices instead.   Le Sigh.",

Unfortunately we were truly disappointed with the food. I ordered the seabass and lobster mac and cheese. I was expecting my seabass to be tender and flaky as I've had it like that at many other restaurants, but instead it was really thick and not soft in the center. I was cutting it as if it was a steak. Not the best choice on the menu. I also had the lobster mac and cheese that was extremely bland and barely had any cheese. My friend said his steak was also bland so that was a disappointment in itself. The best thing on the menu was the glass of wine and champagne that my friend and I shared. I would think since I spent $175 for two meals that the food would be mind blowing. Unfortunately it left us a little disappointed that Ruth Chris didn't live up to the hype. I will say that our waitress Erin was AMAZING. She didn't rush and catered to us the entire time. I would have loved to share with her my disappointment with the food, but I always find it rude to send food back to the chef.",

I am actually wondering how this place has slipped through my review typing fingers. Now granted every time I have been here I have always gotten the same thing, filet mashed potatoes and wedge salad, however I have always made room for food from others plates as well as dessert. If you're a steak lover this place should be your Mecca! The steaks come out perfectly cooked and still simmering on a plate with a little butter at something crazy like hundreds of degrees! The steak literally melts in your mouth and the sides... the SIDES. All of it is good you cannot go wrong mashed potatoes are my fav but the veggies are delish too from the creamed spinach to the broccoli. My guy got the double breasted chicken and it was wonderful but believe me people the steak is where it's at.  I came to the uptown location but have been to South Park as well there's valet in both locations so parking is easy if that's not your thing there's a lot in SP and street spots (if you can find one) uptown that's free on the weekends. This place is kinda fancy but I don't think a real firm dress code but don't quote me on it. Also it will make your life easier if you make a reso. But whatever you have to do definitely make sure you make this place somewhere you try at least once as it's to die for for any steak lover.",

They only had about 6 tables in the dining room and a party of almost 20 people in the banquet room . Service was good . The waiter was nice yet I want to mention the manager who passed  by our table at least four times without stopping to ask about the food or the service. Food was average . We started with the shrimp Cocktail which was the best part of the whole meal. The wedge salad after that was fresh. However when it came to the entrees , my husband's lobster was cold . My salmon was average . As far as the side orders, the asparagus was over grilled and there wasn't anything special about the potato au gratin.  We have dined at the other Ruth in the South Park location and had a much better experience.",

    "text": "Honestly, I dont get why people complain about the prices when they should have known that ruth chris is an upscale restaurant so it shouldnt be a shock.  My boyfriend and I both order salads to start off with, filet for him and ribeye for me. We also ordered mash potatoes and green beans and my boyfriend ordered 2 drinks. Our bill came out to be around $150 excluding tip.  The salads were just salads.. not many ways to make a salad but I really enjoyed the Champagne Vinaigrette (it's not listed on the menu). My boyfriend and I both ordered our steaks medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I usually like my steaks almost medium but I figured since ruth chris is known for serving their steaks on 500 degree hot plates, medium rare would be the best choice. The quality of both steaks was worth every penny. My steak was a little over salted but the quality of the steak was so amazing, I didnt really care but i would ask next time to take it down a notch with the salt. lol   Now, this is the main reason why I wanted to write the review. Ive been to places like Fahrenheit and Capital Grille and the service there was nothing compared to the service we received at Ruth Chris. I regret not being able to catch his name but he was incredible. When I asked him where the restroom was he was nice enough to walk me that way. And I put my napkin on my seat before I left to the bathroom and when I came back it was neatly folded on the table. He even took our valet ticket and had them pull our car up by the time we walked out of the restaurant. Our glasses were never empty and he checked up on us enough to not interrupt our dinner. Just little details that I really appreciated.",

Steak was also very good, properly prepared, and generous in size. My only complaint, or issue with the meal was the items that came with the entrees. The mixed vegetables were only 'so-so', and the salad was of equal value and quality.  This is not intended to be a criticism of the evening, just that I think they could do better. With that I will only give them 4 stars, but I will go back, and will better prepared next time.",

Getting there was horrible,as the area is pretty contested  so give yourself plenty of time. We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. My husband and I both tried one of the Restaraunt Week specials, as well as some appetizers and a bottle of wine. The service was pretty good and the food came out in a timely matter. The steaks were very good but the sides were....just ok. Rather plain and even a little cold. We may try again at another time, but this trip was not really what we were hoping for.",

They've fallen by the wayside with the other previously great steakhouses - cutting corners and serving sub-parr quisine. The quality of the beef sucks, the execution sucks and the side items suck. What a scam. And ... since when does a Manhattan cocktail get made with Domain De Canton? REALLY? Also loved dining with t-shirt clad Millenials who haven't the slightest clue regarding fine cuisine. I think Ruth's Chris should market to these imbeciles and change their sign to \"Sizzler.\" Oops, they already did.",

We had a 9:30 reservation and it was still packed at that hour. We figured everyone would be gone! My father got the bistro filet, lobster tail ( at additional cost), w/ mashed potatoes. His filet came out on a sizzling hot plate and it was awesome. I had the salmon w/ sauteed mushrooms. It was cooked perfectly. My sister had the crab cakes (at additional cost) w/ mashed potatoes and they were fresh and yummy. My mother had the stuffed chicken breast w/ mashed potatoes and it was also good and cheesy. At the end of the meal we requested to have our cheesecakes to-go.   I snuck in the middle of the night to take a bite of it and it was good and creamy....  I would definitely return here again...however most likely during restaurant week or for a special occasion!!! The food here is on the pricey side...but hey you pay for a quality meal!",

My only somewhat disappointing moment was when they brought out the mashed potatoes. They were the consistency of instant mashed potatoes from flakes.  I prefer the mashed potatoes have chunks of potatoes in them. They chef quickly replaced them with chipotle fingerling potatoes and they were awesome!!!!   Valet parking was a breeze, the service was top notch and the food was phenomenal (minus the mashed potatoes).  I also had a coffee which was great, but it would be even better if they offered French press coffee.   Great job guys!!!   Also, the history behind this place is amazing to read. To have come from a one store, Louisiana location to the chain that it is today is phenomenal journey that everyone should know.",

Now, my fairer half--who finds herself quite often having to talk sense into me when I'm too analytical and ridiculous (in this case, concerning a restaurant name)--is from New Orleans and explained to me the story of Chris' Steakhouse, and of Ruth's subsequent purchase of Chris' name, and thus the lispy-sounding restaurant that would become Ruth's Chris.  She also forced (or strongly encouraged) me to eat at Ruth's Chris to cure me of my aversion to eating here.    I really don't crave steak often, but I enjoy eating one here when I do.  The asparagus is pretty damn tasty, and the stuffed mushroom caps are to die for.  And you could actually die if you eat too many of them.  My main reason for visiting Ruth's is to drink scotch with my lady (who, because she is awesome, also drinks scotch) and while away the afternoon, chatting with the friendly bartenders and gazing at each other through hazy, bloodshot eyes.  Mushroom caps and Macallan 18 are the way to a woman's heart, my friends.  Yes indeed.",

    "text": "I'll start from the beginning as I typically do when reviewing a restaurant. We arrived Ruth Chris' a bit early for our 5 pm reservation- though the restaurant was still just opening for the dinner shift, Tashira, the hostess, welcomed my party and I with a warm hello and sat us at the bar while we waited on our table. Erin and Patrick the bartenders were friendly and equally entertaining while creating good conversation and our beverages. Chris and Ashley, the managers on site greeted us while enjoying cocktails at the bar- both with humble greetings and endearment. It was not long before Jessica, another employee, graciously assisted us to our table. Laura Beth our server first introduced herself before engaging us with the daily specials being served that evening. I first noticed her exceptional professionalism, it was rather busy that night and for anyone with knowledge of the foodservice industry, understanding that keeping your cool while doing 300 covers in a fine dining establishment is no easy feat.  After taking our drink order we informed Laura Beth of our plans to attend a concert that began at 7pm sharp, so a sense of urgency was necessary. Z, the servers assistant came at once with bread service, he was kind.  When Laura Beth returned My guest ordered a salad, Petite Filet with BBQ Crab medium rare and Green Beans, and I the Ribeye with Au Poivre sauce medium rare with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and the Potato au Gratin.  Besides the salad of cool vine-ripen tomatoes and mozzarella, the food arrived hot. Let me say again, the food arrived hot! Everything the way I requested and the chef intended. Proteins cooked to the liking of my guest and as requested, seasoned beautifully, the crab- masterfully prepared by the kitchen staff. My au poivre sauce comparative of French bistros. Green beans crisp and delightful; the gratin, luscious, sexy, cheesy goodness. The wine- perfect. Laura Beth arrived once more to find our drinks full and mouths full, courteously smiling back at me knowing my guest and I were doing just fine. Evening though we were in quite the hurry the team at Ruth Chris did a marvelous job keeping my guest and I thoroughly happy as we dined. I happily advise anyone in or traveling to the area to keep Ruth Chris in mind when seeking dinner and a quite night out with a loved one, cocktails and conversation with business associates in the incredible bar, or even a quick lunch on the outdoor patio with views of Tyron Street and the inhabitants going on with their busy city lives.",

Make sure I will stop by again when visiting Charlotte.",

My husband and I could have easily shared the stuffed chicken breast between the two of us, rather than buying/wasting two.  the sides come family style and are also very generous portions, we did order two sides so we ended up with enough food to feed about 5-6 people. There was no point to us bringing the leftovers home because our hotel room doesn't have a microwave, so it was wasted food/money. But this had to have been the best meal we have had in a long time. What would have made the experience better? The waitress could have been a little more informative. Great time all in all.",

For the price, it was literally the worst experience we could have imagined.  I'm keeping this succinct as I don't typically do bad reviews but after telling my friends, they agreed I needed to post.  The waitress oversold blatantly.  The service was bad with at least 30 min breaks between servings.  Dish composition was incorrect.  The food quality was poor: how does a ribeye have no marbling?  Since when does sauteed spinach sit in a half inch of salty liquid?  I could go on.  For a meal well north of $250, totally expected better.  Don't anticipate a return visit.",

Datenight last month had us here as I was holding on to a giftcard I received for my Birthday in 2015 and we decided to use it last month. Our server this visit was Tracy and she was very informative and attentive.  We've been to this location on several occasions, from Happy Hours to live music on the patio events to networking events and datenight dinners. As I mentioned earlier Ruth Chris is Ruth Chris and don't vary much between states except the extreme awesomeness of the original location in NOLA. The service at Ruth Chris is very stella and this location is very keen on service. Our food has never disappointed except that one time when we attended last month and the server offered us some Spinach fro FREE as we didn't want a side with our Sea Bass and we accepted and it taste very horrible and overburnt. The waitress was very apologetic and the chef sent dessert with his compliments of Banana Fosters.  This is a great place to check out on warm weather days the patio is lively though it's small it's very lively.",

She made excellent recommendations throughout our meal and was incredibly attentive. When we mentioned we were celebrating something she came out with flutes of champagne with a raspberry in the bottom on the house. Our dinner was fantastic (of course) and wanted to order dessert but were too full to eat it, so she offered to bring us our desserts boxed and ready to go.

    "text": "We attended a private Caymus wine pairing and was extremely excited. Ultimately, we were glad the wine was awesome as the food fell short. The overall event was disappointing - but there were some highlights. 1st - the set up was lacking. Every table had to ask for bread - multiple times.. got a late start so that would help. We enjoyed the video presentation on the wine but then the meal begins. Unfortunately, the 1st course tends to set the tone. And it was horrible. It was supposed to be crispy lemon sole - instead, we got overdone (and cold) Gordon's fish sticks. It became the running joke of the night with everyone in the room.  At this time, a server began handing out the bills (complete with a service charge of 21% not including the tip. He came by twice to get ours and I finally told him I wasn't going to pay until the meal was over because the first course was dreadful.) The 2nd course was a crab soup. This was good but only tepidly warm. Could have been much better if served hot. The 3rd dish was a pork belly confit. That ended up being solid - cooked well and hot... wine was also kicking In so things were beginning to look up. We overhead one of the servers telling a customer that the petite filet would be served medium. We don't do medium so we called them over and advised we needed medium rare. They brought the steak and it was really good. Redeeming the meal at this point but then another mess up. Instead of the mushroom side that was advertised, we got broccolini with the other side being a bean dish. Just not Ruths Cris standards.  Finished up with a chocolate creme brulee. Great taste - but was approximately a third of a normal size. I attached photos to see the differences.   At the end of the day, the cost for this event was not worth half of what we paid. We took a chance but don't think we would do this again.  Had a lot of fun with other patrons and the wine was great. But the meal was not as advertised. I would stick to going for a normal dinner and not an event style.",

(Seriously give that girl a raise) not only did she give us excellent service, she was also so kind to take our picture for us and then gave us a full list of things to do in Charlotte which was SUPER HELPFUL and gave us things to do the following day.

    "text": "I work in uptown and there are many options for lunch. When I want a quick steak house meal, Ruth's Chris is my go-to option with their 30-minute Lunch for $15. The menu is small but makes it an easy fit for a busy schedule.  My favorite selection is the steak sandwich with bearnaise...minus the sandwich part. I believe that you keep it simple when it comes to eating steak, so I opt to have this dish served with just the sliced tenderloin filet, finished with the house-made bearnaise sauce. I've had the sandwich option the first time order but have made this customized request since, because I feel that the sandwich parts to steak ratio is unbalanced.  The sweet and sour salmon or the lobster bisque and caesar salad combo are both popular, lighter alternate choices on this lunch menu. In my opinion, the sweet and sour thai chili glaze is a bit too sweet, especially in the veggies that come with the salmon.  All of the sides I've had are all cooked simply and are delicious. The decor at Ruth's Chris is the least stuffy of all the steak houses in Charlotte and projects a clean and simple professional vibe.  Overall, the food and experience has been very consistent. Lastly, they offer a seafood gumbo soup that I love to order as an appetizer to satisfy my cravings for a Cajun creole cuisine taste.",

Then we went back when there was a soccer game over at the Panthers stadium. Big mistake. The valet parks cars in the same deck that sells parking for events at the stadium. We gave up and got our own car so we at least had somewhere to sit because he said it would be more than an hour. We gave it another try during restaurant week. Another mistake. The food and service suffered. I felt like everyone in there assumed we couldn't afford to eat here at regular prices. Basically, go when it is not restaurant week and make sure you aren't valeting your car into an event disaster.",

This is Ruth's Chris, if you want to know more about the food, there are plenty of other reviews here that go into great detail.  Instead, this review is all about the amazing service experience we received from our server Marvin. We are a young couple and based on some of the reviews in the past, some of the staff tend to pay more attention to the older, higher-spending tables. I can assure you that in my handful of visits to this location we received above-the-bar service, with no indication that the tables around us we're being given preferential treatment. When we were first seated Marvin promptly engaged us in conversation and asked what we were doing in uptown for the night. He showed us the restaurant week menu and explained the process.  I was extremely surprised at Marvin's knowledge of wines. I noticed that my favourite bottle of Shiraz was not on the menu, not surprised given that it is made by a small winery in Australia. Not only was Marvin familiar with the bottle and the winery, he knew that they just got a bottle in the other day and it was not added to the menu yet. He even sold it to us by the glass!  Throughout the night Marvin came in and out, making sure everything was just perfect. I can't really describe it, but every time he came to the table was unique, not just the cookie-cutter \"Everything OK?\"  My only regret was that I was not able to see Tim (manager) again, he came by our table twice to make sure our dining experience was exceptional. I did not see him before we left but if you are reading this Tim, I want you to know that we came to the restaurant for the Food, but we will be back because of the amazing experience that Marvin and your staff meticulously created for us!",

We were starving after the Panther's game and decided to eat at Ruth's Chris uptown Charlotte. It was nice weather so we dined outside on the patio. We were at the table for 40 minutes before anyone greeted us, that wasn't until I got the servers attention prior to them walking away from the table behind us. We had to ask for water and menus. Finally we were given water and placed our orders at that time out of fear we wouldn't see a server for another 40 minutes. We were at the restaurant a total of 2.5 hours we never received any refill of water. When the server returned to box our food she put our food on a tray with the food of the people from the table behind us (total of 5 different meals, some the same as what we had) so I wasn't interested in taking my leftovers out of fear that she'd mixed up the food when she took it back inside to box it up. I have never received such horrible service, and I feel it was a complete waste of money and time.",

Everything about the meal was delicious. Out steaks were cooked to perfection and served on sizzling hot plates of butter.  We all agreed that the steaks we received this night were some of the best we've tasted.  Steve was extremely personable and made sure our evening was great.

    "text": "Dined Out with my friend for an early dinner on Sunday evening. RC is one of our favorite spots to go here in Charlotte. Our host was Shannon. Although it did not start off as pleasant we ended on a more positive note. Shannon was very sarcastic and didn't seem to have \"silver dining\" skills. The sarcasm was a bit offensive and overall wasn't the best experience. However, Carson my favorite waiter and manager was awesome. I spoke to him earlier and he came over about 4 times just to refill tea, ask if we were ok, chat a little and actually brought some of our dishes out. He was not even waiting tables, he was actually managing! How cool is that. I've always been a fan of his and he is amazing. If you ever go into RC to dine ask for Carson! He's the best and I'm sure he will help all his colleagues get there!  PS While we were waiting for our valet, a manager came up to us and gave us his cards for our next visit to be better. I guess our waitress knew we didn't leave too happy. I think that was nice touch and we left feeling great!   Thanks Ruth Chris...we will be back! Carson you rock!",

I had a bone-in filet while my wife had Salmon. We had a curated chef's meal including salad for my wife, Lobster Bisque for me. Two sides accompanied our meal so we got the garlic mashed potatoes and the grilled asparagus. For dessert we each had a mini bread pudding and chocolate mousse type cheesecake.  I think our meal was ok for such an expensive meal. I think next time I pick from the menu vs. the special curated selection. Our service was excellent and our wine, Darjoush Cabernet Sauvignon was wonderful.",

Folks, they have a nice lunch menu that has some really scrumptious items with all the Ruth's Chris flare!    Our server, Sasha, was graceful and patient with my little family of four as was the lovely girl filling our water and giving us an endless supply of warm bread and fresh butter (she must have noticed my youngest dipping his knife in the butter and licking it....continuously).  Sasha was prompt to refill my coffee, which was some pretty good coffee in my opinion.  I had the portobello mushroom burger and fries.  It was meh, but the fries were so yummy.  My eldest son got the sirloin burger (should have gotten the burger, but I'm a faux vegetarian right now) and french onion soup (everyone was able to sub their fries for something else).  My youngest got some steak sandwich and lobster bisque (I'm not too sure why he chose that, he later thought he was getting the soup we get at the Costco which is actually tomato bisque...he did not eat it  **SHOCKER!!**)  The bread for that steak sandwich was like Texas Toast, only better.  On to dessert, because life is short, you need dessert!  The youngest wanted Creme Brulee, and luckily we convinced him to go with the cheesecake.  Guys, this is not your average cheesecake.  You know how some cheesecakes have a tang?  Well, this is mild and smooth and there is an abundance of graham cracker crust.  Next to it is a smidgen of fresh fruit that makes this dessert even more blissful when you mix the two together.    It was expensive for a family of four around $100.00 including drinks and dessert...but this isn't your average lunch place either.",

I started with one waitress and was changed to another.  I asked a few questions since this was my first restaurant week as well.  I placed my order for my starter, no problem here.  I did not receive the traditional bread that comes out with a meal, no explanation was given. I placed my order for the Lamb chop trio; I was advised a few minutes later you did not have the entree.  Correct me if I am wrong at the start of any business isn't it customary for the chief to inform the staff if the supply is depleted?  I ordered the second choice the lemon pepper chicken. I made sure to inform Jesse it was my first time participating in restaurant week.  The chicken and the mash potatoes as a side were great.  I ordered the dessert; again it was not the items listed on the menu.  Disappointed I ordered the substitute. When the dessert arrived I explained I did not eat the berries that garnished the top.  She told me she could bring me an additional cheesecake. I believe at this point Jesse assumed I would not be tipping so it was though I was bothering her.  I received my bill and provided the usual 20% tip, my personal standard preference.  Once she received the tip I noticed her attitude changed drastically. When I arrived home I noticed the dessert was the original one and someone simply removed the garnish of berries.  I am not sure why I received the second class citizen service; needless to say I am not pleased. Overall, the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.   The food is over priced.",

I would expect more when paying $39 for a steak. That's a loss of a star. Presentation was lacking... It came served by itself on a little white plate. The carafe holding the mashed potatoes was larger. Two small shrimp accompanied it. That's a loss of a 1/2 star. The service takes away another star. They were pleasant and personable enough, but there's no need for them to know my name...I probably won't be back there again. Also, too many servers/waitstaff were in the soup. One took my drink order. Another took my dinner order. Still another took my dessert order. The last guy didn't know that I ordered one of their specials that came with salad, dessert and entree and he tried to sell me another expensive dessert. That's my biggest gripe....Why does an upscale, expensive place like this constantly try to upsell you every time they come to the table? I don't need suggestions off the menu. If I wanted the additional lobster tail for $18, I'll order it myself. I don't want to order a more expensive dessert than what I wanted. I felt like they were holding me by the legs upside down until all of the money fell out of my pockets.",

Located conveniently in the center of Uptown and a nice patio as well.  We sat on the patio the other night and Cassie was our waitress. She was so attentive and friendly and did a great job from start to finish. I am too weak to ever deny the warm bread and butter but it is just SO good. I am also a big fan of their wedge salad (I always add the six grilled shrimp for $15) and ask for the dressing on the side as well as a side of oil and vinegar. I am also a big fan of their lunch menu (go with the Ahi Tuna salad!).   My husband always orders the filet and it is consistently delicious every time. The corn with jalapenos and au gratin potatoes are probably our favorite sides but we are also fans of the mashed potatoes, asparagus and creamed spinach.   Solid wine menu with a generous variety available by the glass. They also have a pretty good Happy Hour menu served Monday through Friday in the bar. Deals on a handful of appetizers, cocktails and wine by the glass. Good for groups after work!",

The service is always impeccable and when the occasional misstep occurs (which is rare), they step up and resolve quickly.  For a large chain-type restaurant they do very well, but I've had better steaks at lesser price.  My last dinner was a 16 oz ribeye for $49 plus sides.  That's $49/pound.  Although cooked to order, modern beef just doesn't taste like it did when I was raised on the farm.  Too few grass-fed cows in lieu of quickly grown, steroid injected, genetically engineered bovines masquerading as the real deal.  But, we had a wonderful time and I say give 'em a whirl.",

I went to wash my hands and when I came back I found that our table was ready at the time promised and we were seated.  Our waiter was awesome, he had a wonderful sense of humor, understood that we were out without kids, and held some generally good conversation.  The key to that being successful is that he was also on point with the orders, kept our water full, and more importantly kept the wine flowing.    Everyone ordered steak because it's a steak house, and queens feast comes with a salad, side and desert.  The salad was as good as rabbit food can be, but the steak...the steak was perfect.  I have had steaks from Ruth's Chris dozens of times, but this one was just perfect.  It was cooked to perfection, with a slight moooooo as I bit into it, but also warm.    I also had mushrooms for my side, and they were amazing.  Sharing the cream spinach and fries at the table, it was a great meal.  We were never rushed and had a wonderful time.  My mouth is watering recalling the steak as I type this.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner for restaurant week. They opened an hour earlier than usual to accommodate as many guests as possible for restaurant week, which worked in our favor. We were informed that they were expecting 700 guests that night.   We ordered items from the restaurant week menu, as well as from the regular menu. I had the Savory Mushroom Soup to start. It consisted of pureed button mushrooms, onions, butter, vegetable stock, and chopped parsley. Even though the mushroom was pureed, you could still taste the mushroom, but not enough for my boyfriend to be bothered by it! He is not the biggest fan of mushroom, but he actually enjoyed the soup. We also had the Seared Ahi Tuna ($18, regular menu). The pieces were laid over a bed of sauce with wasabi and accompanied by pickled ginger over zucchini and red bell pepper. Normally, the center is raw and the outside is lightly seared. Ours was overcooked. The entire piece of each piece was cooked all the way through, making it tough and chewy.  I had the Petite Filet (8oz) and my boyfriend had the Filet Mignon (11oz, extra $13). My boyfriend and I both asked for medium rare. His was perfect, but mine came back as downright rare. I still ate it, and it was juicy, but it was not what I had requested. I wished our ahi tuna was this rare, instead of my steak. I was told by the waitress that I would not be receiving the center cut, but the menu indicated that I should...I also want to point out that initially, we were asked if we wanted Fiji water or sparkling water, as if these were our only options for water.   We had Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Spinach as sides, and both were fantastic. Loved that the mashed potatoes were slightly chunky, just how I like my mashed potatoes. Boyfriend paired his meat with a glass of Andis Painted Fields ($14), while I went with a glass of Riesling ($12, regular menu) instead. Both were great, but I always prefer white wines, so I loved the sweetness of mine much more. We also had Creole Crab (extra $14). Presentation was very poor, and I could not taste the Creole spices. The chunks of crab meat were still delicious, but they tasted as if they had simply been bathed in butter with black pepper sprinkled on top.  We finished with Vanilla Cheesecake and Chocolate Pecan Bark (2 pieces). The cheesecake had a raspberry, blackberry, and a couple blueberries on top. It was beautiful and actually resembled panna cotta. Loved the richness and soft texture. Wish I had a few more pieces of bark.  Service was good. There were about 6-7 managers checking on all the tables in our room, which seemed a bit excessive, but it shows how much they care. Complimentary valet parking is available.",

Those are the pros of the visit.   Here are the cons: They were out of Lamb Chips (on Father's Day), which was unacceptable. Regarding our appetizers, the calamari was dripping wet with sauce, mushy, and not crispy at all. They did replace our calamari, but nevertheless, this dish should NOT have been sent to our table in the first place. Ruth's Chris should know better.   Regarding the side dishes... none of our sides were hot. They were lukewarm at best, which is unacceptable since this is a health code violation. Next, our potatoes au gratin had cheese ONLY on the surface. The potatoes were barely cooked and there was NO cheese throughout. We lifted up the top layer only to find white, al dente potatoes beneath. Unacceptable.   The cocktail list: we asked our server FOUR times to bring out a cocktail list. Finally, he did bring it out but AFTER our appetizers were served.   I would've complained about our side dishes and cocktails. However, it appeared that the staff was scampering around and the restaurant was not even packed so I didn't waste my time.   All in all, my family and I were dissatisfied with this visit to Ruth's Chris Uptown.   -Monica Russell (party of 6)  <a href=\"mailto:mrussell9217@gnail.com\">mrussell9217@gnail.com</a>",

Host said they'd go let them know and then they answered immediately. I didnt know what to order and asked for suggestions. I was recommended a few items but ultimately told my steak order was great which also had both little seafood and steak. I ordered the porterhouse for two(shrimp mentioned), lobster mac, and mashed potatoes. I was a little disappointed because when I arrived it was reiterated it was a good choice and came with shrimp but noticed I didn't when I got home. Not a huge deal but I was disappointed not expecting irems, but told I'd get it and then didn't.  Valet service pull up for Togo was friendly and quick. When I arrived to the bar the person was nice, and being handed the Togo order by a gentleman he seemed kind as well. Note to management, it's great when staff can speak to menu items but a little disappointing that it was misinformed. Steak was cooked perfect, tasted great.. best item of all three ordered. I would recommend it for portion size too.",

The sea bass was not good at all, kind of rubbery and not very hot. My dates filet was good as well as the Au gratin potatoes. We both got Caesar salads to start and they were both underwhelming. I decided not to ruin the date by being a complainer but since I spent $240.00, I decided to leave a review instead. For that amount of money for a meal, I expect it to be amazing.

    "text": "I have eaten at this location of Ruth's on a few occasions and not until this last meal over the weekend have I felt compelled to write a review. I know that this is a chain restaurant and they adhere to certain food standards but when I sat at the bar on Friday night I couldn't help but feel like i was in an upscale McDonald's. The service I received was just okay, not the kind of service that you would receive from a place where you pay $36 for just a steak on a hot plate with some butter... I have eaten at their SouthPark location as well and always felt that their servers were more attentive and polished. These guys should step their game up since there are many other dining options with better service and better food at a lower price in Uptown.",

I must say the RC was the better of the two. The price was about the same but I recieved more food for the money at RC. I ordered the T-Bone and was very satified with the taste and flavor of the steak. I also order a side baked potatoe and it was also done very well. My girlfriend order Filet cooked 3 different ways and she too was very happy with her meal. I would return in the future as this was a great meal and experience out.",

    "text": "We went here because we had a $100 gift certificate. I've always heard good things about this place so I was anxious to try it. I knew it was typically very pricey but the website showed a new menu that paired salad, entree and dessert for a more reasonable price. Unfortunately, this menu was unavailable the night we went. I started off with a Steak House salad with the Lemon basil dressing. It was quite good. For my meal I ordered the Creole crab topped filet. My husband got the regular filet and we shared a side dish of Lyonnaise potatoes. My steak was seriously over salted not to mention dripping in butter. My husband said his steak, as well as the potatoes were over salted as well. Call me crazy but I think if you can charge $35 for an ala carte steak then it should be absolutely amazing on it's own without a need for salt or butter (or minimal). When the waitress asked how things were I was nice but honest in that it wasn't fabulous. The manager came over and tried to appease us and even offered to send me home with a new steak. I graciously declined but they delivered us each a \"complimentary\" dessert. It was some kind of berry topped cheesecake and was probably the highlight of the meal. When the bill came I noticed that I was overcharged for my steak as well as the two glasses of wine. I purposely ordered the least expensive wine because at $10 a glass I figured it still had to be pretty good. At that point we didn't want to cause more problems so we just paid it. Overall, I was definitely underwhelmed and will not return. The service was very good but even with $100 gift card it still cost us over $50. There is no way the food was close to worthy of those prices. At least I can check that one off my list.",

I ordered the filet with shrimp and mistakenly asked for medium well because I can't eat meat that is too raw.  The meat was very charred, tough and dry. Too bad to see it that way. The shrimp was flavorful and delicious. I had a side of asparagus which was cooked perfectly. Luckily the hollandaise sauce helped to moisten and add flavor to the meat as well. I had the apple tart for dessert because it was described as having a flaky crust. Turns out the crust was tuff and soggy. Clearing it had died a quick death in the microwave. Fortunately the apple filling was juicy and flavorful. For the money, I definitely would have expected more. I've often wondered what the chain was like and now I know that I will not be going back.",

Everythingn was truly perfect.  The food was really good.  Michael, our waiter, was simply great and very attentive.  I had my two little girls with me that night and they went above and beyond in accomodating them and even gave them toy cows and crayons to play with.  The steaks were fantastic!!  We had 5 adults and 2 children and we ordered 2 filets, 1 Salmon entree, 1 Cowboy Steak and one 3-course meal that included a filet topped with shrimp.  We didn't do much drinking.  We only had the filtered water and one glass of wine.  Then we had 3 desserts and 2 coffees.  I was expecting a total bill of $500+ easy, but it came in at around $340, so I was pleasantly surprised.  We really had a nice time and will be back again.",

    "text": "My boyfriend is a Marine and I thought this would be a great place to have a nice dinner before he has to leave for almost a month of training. I made reservations and we arrived about 15 minutes early. Only 20 seconds after walking in the door, our hostess showed us to our table in a smaller dining room but was still open and inviting. And then we met our server, Kev. Oh Kev. Literally was the nicest server I ever had. He was very quick to smile and make nice conversation with me and my boyfriend. He was very quick  to clear our empty plates and keep glasses full and make suggestions as to what to order for dinner. I took his suggestion and ordered the petite filet Oscar style. Oh. My. Goodness. It was delicious. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and the crab on top was perfect as well. The hollandaise was to die for.  I have been dreaming of eating this steak every day since. My boyfriend ordered the ahi tuna stack. A lot lighter than my filet but equally as delicious. We split a side of the mashed potatoes which were good too. We were unable to finish the potatoes from being so full from the entrees. The general manager stopped by our table to see if everything was good. We explained our reason for the mashed potatoes going unfinished, but she still added a discount to our bill and a free slice of sin cake. That was above and beyond the quality of service than I expected. After the entrees, I ordered a black coffee to eat with the sin cake. Very glad I did. The sin cake was very rich and chocolatey and the black coffee was a great compliment with it. I had to throw in the towel after polishing off my coffee but my boyfriend finished off the cake. We nearly rolled out of the restaurant from being so full, but extremely happy. I will definitely return for another special occasion soon!",

We had the chocolate sin cake for dessert.  To die for.  The GM served our meal and once again there was a problem with my husband's steak.  He order medium.  It came rare.  Really rare.  GM was watching the table and whisked it away.  My husband would have eaten it without complaint.  I give them an A+ for effort.   I'm sure the kitchen got an earfull.  Fergus was very embarrassed.  Will we be back...of course, not. The main reason is the flavor of the steaks.  Or lack of.  I have tasted more flavorable steaks at Logans. They have some kitchen clean up to do but if we're going to spend $200 on a meal, we'll be going back to Flemmings.",

When we sat down we were approached by our waitress who failed to ask why we had come in, and furthermore failed to suggest any of their specials. A few minutes before receiving our salads we finally received our waters after waiting at least 15 minutes. Once we had finished our mediocre salads (three croutons and 1 and a half cherry tomatoes per dinner salad), we finally reviewed our wine. My caeser salad was bland at best. My boyfriend had the steakhouse salad with a decent bleu cheese dressing. While waiting for our steaks, a couple sat down next to us, ordered relatively the same meals, and had much better service. Their waiter was attentive, delivered their food and drinks in a timely fashion, asked for their valet parking slip and delivered their bill to them ALL before our waitress could even deliver our desserts. I finally got my last glass of wine (I had ordered with my steak) after I was finished with my dessert. Our waitress would have been average at an Applebee's. Our experience at Ruth's was subpar.",

Stuart Greeted us at the table and gave his expert opinion on wine and food for the day. We were given a complimentary taste of Moscato, and at the end of the night dessert.   The night overall could not have gone better, it was great to escape the restaurant week rush, and hide away in our own quite room.

They had a special going (Restaurant Week) on that offered a 3 course meal for a fixed price, which worked well if you were interested in the options on that menu since every dish is ordered separately (salad, entree, side - as expected from an upscale restaurant).   The service was slow and sporadic at times or just MIA all together, I just check it off as it being Friday night and busy. The food took awhile to come out but it was sizzling hot and of course the steak is served on the hot plate so it keeps the steak warm, the chefs can cook it to the temperature you ask for. The garlic mash potatoes and creamed spinach are a MUST HAVE - it's practically dessert! All around good experience for a special night out.  Would recommend to anyone interesting in a decent dining experience for special occasions or just out for the night with your special one.",

    "text": "Ruth's Chris might be your go-to place for ordering that sizzling butter-topped steak in the evening, but little does anyone know of it's other delicious offering as an ideal spot for Sunday Brunch. I dedicate this review to one dish that stands out far ahead of its peers...  Truly, nothing beats a hangover like Eggs Benedict \"a la Ruth's Chris.\" You get two golden-toasted halves of an english muffin which are then topped with a juicy piece of FILET (recommended medium-rare)! You could probably eat that dish right there as is, but then they go ahead and top the muffins off with a soft-boiled egg (perfect yolky texture), and slather on a creamy homemade hollandaise. I can't compare anything to the experience of eating this dish. It's in its own stratosphere. The steak gives \"bite\" to the dish and the yolk is soaked up by the muffin. An ingenious construction of the culinary mind, these eggs ARE worth writing home about. I dont' know if they put crack in the muffins, or lace the meat with somethin suspect, but I'm clamoring for more and now look forward to every Sunday just to get my $20 brunch.   There's a certain level of class in the presentation and even though you're probably eating a caloric bomb, you don't feel \"heavy\" at the end. I'm not just hyping this dish up. It really is the most amazing eating experience you'll have in awhile, especially if you're looking for something new.   If you haven't tried this then you're missing out on life. This is one of those things you'd enjoy if you happen to like things that are delicious. I fall in that demographic and so I'm recommending it for your eating pleasure!  5/5",

We made reservations for dinner about 1.5 to 2 weeks ago to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We arrived for our reservation and were told that we would be seated shortly. About 10 minutes later we were offered a booth in the bar which to me was odd because we had reservations. Because we were celebrating our anniversary we really didn't want to sit in the bar so we chose to wait the additional 15 minutes.  We were seated in a lovely booth in the main dining area.  We ordered and enjoyed the bread, appetizers and our wine. My husband and I both ordered the  filet. My filet came out cooked just the way I ordered it (medium) but unfortunately my husband's came out very,very rare (he ordered it medium rare). His steak was sent back not only once but twice until they got it right. The manager was very nice and accomodating and wanted to make sure my husband was happy.  Although my meal was delicious by he time my husband's came out  it was not hot anymore. He wanted me to eat while we were waiting for his so I did nibble a little but I wanted us to enjoy our meals together.   At the end of the meal there was some food left over that I was going to take home and our waitress instructed the bus girl what we wanted to take home. The bus girl then proceeded to load our dishes on to a large serving tray and right next to the food that we were going to take home she bussed another table and put their dirty dishes right next to ours that contained the food we were going to take home. Seeing this completely made me sick so I  decided to just leave the doggy bag at the restaurant once the bus girl brought my food to the table from the back. We left the doggy bag at our table when leaving and she was nice enough to bring it out to us because she thought we forgot it.  I explained to her why we did not want to take it home. She was surprised and said that is just how they do it there. While we were waiting for the valet outside another employee ( I believe he may have been a manager - Chris)  came out and apologized. He told us that she was wrong and that it is not their standard to do that and he offered to make us more food to take home which was nice but at that point the valet was getting our car and we were ready to leave. He did give us a card for a free bottle of wine which did appease us at the time but then when we got home we realized that it is only a particular type of wine and it is only free if you purchase 2 meals and it expires in 2 months.  We usually love coming to this restaurant and have even been to this particular location many times but given this experience we will not be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I brought my fiance here as a graduation present. I'm vegetarian, so he busted out laughing when I emphatically said, \"This is the BEST broccoli I've ever had!\" It honestly was, though (Broccoli au Gratin). The cheese was perfectly crunchy-chewy around the sides, and creamy underneath. Despite it being fresh out of the oven (and therefore burning hot), it was gone in the first 5 minutes and I'd kill to have it again. Green beans and mashed potatoes were beyond perfect as well, and my fiance seemed infatuated with his filet. It was brought out a little less than medium at first, but the sizzling plate finished that job as he continued eating. At the end of the night, they sent us off with the complimentary chocolate cheesecake. I ate it the next day- it was deeeeelish!  Dom was our server for the night and he was everything a restaurant waiter should be- visible and accommodating, but not overbearing. He was professional, he came up at the right times without being obnoxious, and whenever our conversation paused, I noticed that he was always nearby and he would have been easily accessible if we ever had ever found that we needed his attention (even though we didn't).   It was a great night out and I'd love to do it again. But of course, don't go if you're not willing to spend some money. It was over $80 (before a tip) for two glasses of wine, a vegetable plate and the filet. But it was WELL worth it. I may have to steal their recipe for the Broccoli au Gratin. Meat-eaters laugh all you want, but it rocked my socks off!",

    "text": "Beware if you make reservations with this location over the phone. Actually, my recommendation would be to NOT make a reservation with this specific Ruth's Chris without confirming documentation. We made reservations over the phone- I have the date and time on my phone record- for an early dinner on New Year's Eve two weeks in advance. There were two time slots available and we chose the earlier of the two. Fast forward to New Year's Eve...we arrive 30 minutes before our reservation time and they claim the reservation \"can't be found\". While they ultimately provided a table there was unnecessary hassle which was completely a product of their negligence. Quality restaurants- especially steakhouses- shouldn't exhibit such incompetence by failing to record reservations which they have conveyed. Oh yeah, food was typical Ruth's Chris- solid if you like the way they prepare their steaks. Unfortunately, the evening was sullied by the initial episode.",

(Fortunately, our anniversary coincides with Charlotte's Restaurant Week, so we were able to get an amazing meal at a much more inexpensive price.)   Everything was amazing! We arrived at the restaurant about 30 minutes early, so we went to the bar...great bartending staff. I started off with a delicious flirtini off of the cocktails menu. Once our table was ready, we were escorted to our table and immediately greeted by our server with two flutes of champagne as a congrats for our anniversary. Very nice touch!   Our meal was outstanding. I ordered the carrot and ginger soup, which was light and creamy. Then came the entrees. We both got filets, which came out on sizzling hot plates, so the meat stayed warm from the first to very last bites. We also ordered sides of the creamed corn and garlic mashed potatoes...yummy! Last, but not least, we had the mini cheesecake desserts. Perfect size and very light and sweet.  Every person who works there - from the valet to the wait staff, bartenders and the managers - are very professional and extremely nice. Great customer service!! When we made the reservation, we simply requested a dining experience that would make our anniversary special and memorable...they certainly did that!!",

I would definitely recommend RC if you are looking for a nice place to eat...just be prepared to pay for it.  Our meals, with a glass of wine each and tip, was about $175.",

I wish they'd bring it back, it was such a deal and made ordering a breeze.  Their steak - you have to start there - is literally mouth-watering. Seriously, it's spectacular. The filet is to die for (TIP: Get it LESS done than you normally like. It will keep cooking on your plate).  The calamari is outstanding!  Their creamed spinach is my favorite side. We go here many times a year (even brought employees here for holiday dinner) and always leave very happy!   They also have happy hour with this great lemonade-like cocktail with blueberries. Their Happy Hour food options (sliders!) are great too.  The desert has never been that good to me (and I love deserts), but everything else is perfection! You're so full at the end it doesn't matter anyway.",

I wasn't that impressed. I thought the steak was average at best. But still hearing all the hype around it, I thought, well maybe its because its the 1st time i've paid this much for food, the price turned me off. But no... the next time I tried was during Charlotte Restaurant Week. We ordered the Calamari appetizer, it was delicious but a small portion for the table. So needing a little more we ordered another one. This time it was 3 times the size of the 1st plate. If they had gave us that plate 1st, we wouldn't have ordered 2. That inconsistency was annoying. Then we got our steak entrees... and having been to multiple upscale steak houses by this point in my life... I determined it wasn't me, it was them. The steak just didn't impress me. So I will not be returning.",

    "text": "I had never heard of this restaurant until my husband suggested we take our mom's out to dinner here for Mother's Day.    We rolled up to valet service which was really nice.  We had a 7pm reservation and were seated immediately.  Our party of 4, then met our server Marvin, who was fabulous in every way.  He was on point with all our questions, he was personable, charming and very attentive without being annoying.    We started with apps - BBQ shrimp, calamari and crab cakes.  The portions were bigger than we expected and everyone enjoyed everything.  The calamari app was the biggest and we had to have the rest boxed up because we couldn't finish it.  Next came salad...tomato mozzarella, two iceburg wedges with bacon and blue cheese crumbles and a steak house salad. I had asked originally to have the dressing for the steak house salad on the side, but the salad arrived with dressing on it and sadly it was overdressed.  We told Marvin and he immediately whisked it away and came back with an undressed salad with dressing on the side. All the salads were fresh and crisp and delicious.    Then our main course. One ribeye with baked potato, one ribeye with lobster tail and shoestring fries, one NY strip with tempura onion rings and one order of lamb chops with sauteed mushrooms. When all the sizzling plates arrived, our mouths were watering.  Everything was hot, cooked exactly as requested, well seasoned and perfect.  Some sides were family size, and they weren't kidding. The shoestring fries were huge and scrumptious...just the right amount of crispiness.  We had to box up a few things because there was just no way we could eat everything AND still have dessert.    Oh dessert...Creme Brulee, cheesecake and two chocolate avalanches of ganache goodness with ice cream on top. To.Die.For.  Everything was exquisite and just so flavorful.    But besides the food, and the amazing service (because did I mention Marvin was outstanding?), what we really enjoyed was that everything was so wonderfully spaced out.  We didn't feel rushed. One course wasn't sent out until the course before was completely done. Everything from our arrival to the check was done purposefully to make the entire dinner an experience.  Marvin even had the valet pull our car around before we left so it would be there when we exited.  There's something to be said about a place that cares about every little detail, down to removing any crumbs from the table between courses and not being intrusive during the meal.    This was more than just a dinner, it's something we will remember for a long time. We are already trying to figure out when we can go back because this is an experience you should have more than one time.  Oh Ruth Chris, you got it right!",

This was the first weekend of the Queen's Feast/restaurant week so they were understandibly busy, but we were seated shortly after our reservation time.  Service was excellent (Jane) and things were fine until our steaks (both filets ordered medium) arrived.  They were undercooked.    While waiting to get our server's attention (she had a tray of food for another table) another RC employee (non server) noticed us and came over to see if there was an issue.  She arranged for our steaks to be sent back.  We ate some of our sides while we were waiting (we were hungry; we hadn't eaten much that day in anticipation of this meal), but when our steaks came back out, they refreshed our sides with hot offerings without us even having to ask.  Our server was apologetic and gave us a good tip on how to order next time as their written descriptions of doneness doesn't really jive with what the kitchen  sends out.    The GM came by as well to apologize and to check to see if we were now pleased.  And while we didn't ask for any concessions, when the bill came they did right by us.  While we were waiting for the steaks to come back out my husband and I discussed going to a different steakhouse the next time.  However because they handled this situation so professionally and they were so customer focused, we won't be going anywhere else.  The food is excellent, the service is great, and the portions are substantial.  My honest ranking would be 4.75, not a perfect 5  just because the steaks were initially undercooked.  However I highly recommend this location of this storied restaurant franchise.",

Dinner however will set you back QUITE a bit more.......just be prepared to pay high prices for that high quality food, especially their steaks. Their 8oz Lunch Fillet was $36! That's why their $15 lunch is such a bargain. Try their steak sandwich for lunch....a STEAL at $15.",

    "text": "After a few crummy experiences at the SouthPark location, we decided to give Uptown a try, and I'm so glad we did.  We arrived an hour before our dinner reservation to have a drink at the bar.  The drinks were great, and the bartenders were super friendly and engaging.    Dinner was perfect.  Our waiter, Chris, was funny, awesome and had great recommendations.  We got the BBQ shrimp appetizer, which was fine, but there's only so much you can do with shrimp.  We also got the calamari and devoured it - some of the best in Charlotte.  Fella got the filet with scallops for dinner, and I got the filet tournedos (three 4 oz filets; one with blue cheese, one with crab meat and one with shrimp).  I love that the plates are sizzling hot when they come out!  We definitely left fat and happy, and I'm happy the uptown location restored my faith in Ruth's Chris.",

They offer various $15 lunch specials and happy hour bites. I absolutely love the steak sandwich with Bearnaise. The portion size is perfect and filling. The crab cakes are also phenomenal! Great spot to grab a bite and it doesn't have to kill the wallet (though it certainly would be worth it).",

    "text": "Party of four , early New Year's Eve dinner. Fair. I offer my comments having eaten here once before and thought it was good though clearly a step below Capitol Grille down the street.  They take early reservations, ours for 5:30 They start valet parking at 6:00. So you can drop your guest off at the door, but they can't figure out a way to shuttle from a lot and have the valet claim the car for the guest at the conclusion of the dinner.  Price fix dinner $75. With wine, party of four approx $425.00.  Salad tasty but quite small. My rather small though advertised as 14 ounce NY Strip Steak had four pieces of gristle cooked rare though I asked for medium rare. I thought Chef did good job with seasoning, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the steak itself. Food was served on what I would consider all side dishes, small six/seven inch oval ceramic plates. It was not an appetizing presentation, and the same applies to the creamed spinach and potato sides.  The dessert was a mini cheese cake and some type of chocolate ganache cake. Both soft, no contrasting taste. The waiter was okay, the servers very nice. I did not see a manager or supervisor orchestrating the floor flow.  In the end it was okay, fair, not an early New Years Dinner that we will remember. Hope it is better if we decide to dine there again.",

Like I said, great food, amazing customer service experience, and the location of this place is nice. If you are looking to dress up, maybe blow about 100-200$ (for 2 people) on dinner, then this is your place. I guess I'm a person who lives on the cheaper side of life. And I can make a steak at home just has awesome as theirs for literally 75% cheaper. Haha :)  (Great for special occasions and if you're really into a woman, it's the first date, and you want to impress, go here. lol)",

Their wine selection and the staff is very attentive. This Ruths Chris is one of the best restaurants in downtown Charlotte and every time I have visited, the experience and food have given me multiple reasons to keep coming back.",

The wait staff from the minute we walked in to the moment we left was over the top. Our servers knowledge on wine alone was remarkable, his descriptions on our bottle of Faust made my mouth water even before the bottle hit the table. The manager Greg even made us feel special by bringing us a complimentary dessert just to thank us for coming in.  We will be back again to sit out on the patio very soon!",

We made reservations for 8:30 and we were seated by 8:45. Of course we had cocktails while we waited...Our waiter was Simon and he was amazing very knowledgeable and walked us through different wine selections, and starters...everyone selected something different so we could make sure we got most for our money, lol :) And everything was delicious!!!  So here's what I had...  My meal started off with a wedge salad blue cheese crumbles, bacon and the vinaigrette dressing, the presentation was delicious it was a huge portion for the start of the meal!!! To be honest I expected it to be mostly lettuce, but was pleasantly surprised that there was more than enough blue cheese crumbles and bacon toppings to satisfy my tastebuds!  Next was the entree I selected the Bistro Filet with Crispy Onions--absolutely  delicious the meat was so tender I could practically cut it with my fork, there is nothing worse than an over cooked steak....ugh but this was far from it...and from the other dishes I think they dont know how to cook anything wrong...I think if I had to amend my last meal it would include this....sorry mom! But my mouth is still watering from how delicious it was!   Dessert was the Trio Cheesecake and even though I was stuffed to the brim I had to taste it, and just like the rest of the meal I was not disappointed....  Overall, this was an excellent meal and excellent restaurant, the food, service and experience make it worth a second, third and fourth trip!",

    "text": "I had my best restaurant experience EVER at Ruth's Chris. My date made reservations for 7:30pm on a Friday night. The second we walked in, we were greeted by smiling hosts who complimented how nice we looked. They then proceeded to ask if we were going to prom lol We expected it and I'll take it as a compliment :)  One of the hostess led us to our seats. She sweetly pulled the chair out for me, placed the wine menus on the table and joked if we were even enough for wine lol Moments later, we were greeted by our waiter. He was very tentative and informative as he introduced the menu and the night's specials. He asked if there were any special occasions for the night that he could help accommodate (birthdays, anniversaries, etc). We replied that it was a simple date night. I wish I could remember his name. He was so sweet!  We ended up ordering the T-Bone and Rib-eye steaks. The rib-eye is much more tender and was cooked to perfection. The waiter waited for us to cut our steaks once it was brought to the table. He wanted to ensure they were cooked correctly. The side dishes were served family style. Overall, the meal was absolutely amazing! Throughout dinner, our waiter consistently checked on us, making sure our experience was enjoyable.  The best part is at the end of our meal, our sweet waiter brought out complimentary dessert (even though we told him that there was no special occasion)! It was a sampler that came with a sorbet, cheesecake and chocolate cake. I have a horrible sweet tooth and this was by all means, my favorite part of the meal! We intended to walk around uptown and grab dessert elsewhere, but the sampler was very filling and delicious!  As stated, this was the best restaurant experience I have EVER had!",
