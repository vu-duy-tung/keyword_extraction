    "text": "Yet another nicely designed, trendy place in NoDa with a cool atmosphere, great drinks and awesome vibe.  Me and seven of my friends and family decided we give give this, relatively new, joint a shot on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks.  Given that they don't take reservations and my party was rather large, I was worried we would have a horrific wait.  Haberdish uses the Nowait app making the wait, well a little less.  Not no wait like the name would suggest.  Regardless, there's many other places to grab a drink while you wait, or no wait, or whatever...  We started off with a few craft cocktails.  Habiscus this, Moscow that.  I can't remember all of the names but everything we tried was really good and mildly flavored.  Nothing has a punch in the face, over bearing flavor of anything.  Well done bar gang!  Shortly after drinks, we had some apps. An assortment of pickles, cheese straws, smoked deviled eggs and hush puppies.  Nothing crazy or out of this world. Everything tastes good but nothing popped.  Entrees came out shortly after we cleared the app plates.  Entrees are healthy portions and sides can be ordered single or family style.  I ordered the pork shank which was very well cooked, very tender.  I wasn't a fan of the house BBQ sauce that was on the pork.  It was almost like a sweet Asian sauce mixed with BBQ.  My table also had some of the chicken and cauliflower steaks.  Chicken was a little dry and tough but the cauliflower steaks were amazing.   The assortment of sides was plentiful and unique.  Kale grits (grits with creamed kale), sweet potato dumplings, Mac and cheese and corn bread pudding.  They were all good but I was pretty aggravated when we had two corn bread pudding's and one came out completely burnt.  The bottom was jet black.  We weren't charged for it but how that came out to the table was sloppy.  Overall, service was nice, not super but nice.  Food was different, enjoyable and moderately priced.  Atmosphere was fun and hip.  I'd definitely go back.",

    "text": "This has to be my all time favorite restaurant. I've came here enough times to make a well rounded review.  What to get: Fried Chicken, Sweet Potato Dumplings, Tater Tots, Fried Okra, Deviled Eggs - in that order.   Mixed Drinks, my two favorites is the Cotton Gin -$10 and the viral, Honey Bee and the Buzzing Monk - $18  The food is CONSISTENT - which helps keep me coming back.  and the decor and ambiance is southern with a modern twist. They do not take reservations, but they are on an app called \"No Wait\" where you can put your name in line and you can receive a text when your table is ready.   The Food SURPASSES the service. All times but 1, have we had a terrible server. Drinks refilled maybe once during our dining experience.  I make it a point to be very kind and make eye contact and thank the server for everything they do for the table. I was a server and I understand rude tables.   My most recent experience- had me disgusted. She actually asked in a rude tone \"Are You Happy Now?\"  When food came out. In reality no one at our table was upset we were all happy and having a good time while waiting for our food. She did an excellent job of consistently rolling her eyes and not returning to our table. She also proceeded to question us on our order, saying \"are you really sure you want this much food?\"  \"Are you actually going to eat this?\" With an attitude. Our table ate everything but the BBQ Glazed Carrots.   If I continue to get rude service I cannot see my self recommending this restaurant any more. I've referred so many of my friends here.",

We wrapped up shopping and headed over to NODA.  The streets were packed but there was plenty of parking at the Y which is right in front of Haberdish. It was raining but there's a covered patio and a few tables outside. We got a table near the center and our waiter was quick to take a drink order.  The cocktail menu is unique with some old fashion libations with some interesting twist. The table next to us ordered a bowl of punch that was served table side from a beautiful bowl.   The food is served  a la carte and family style. The appetizers are plenty for 2 - 3. We had the deviled eggs and biscuits with bacon jam which I would certainly have again. The fried chicken and tenders were recommended but they were not amazing just okay. The Mac and cheese noodles were way under done but it had a good flavor.   It's hard to order dessert here when Popbar is across the street but the waffle with homemade buttermilk ice cream sounds like a winner.",

The wait was long but we put our names on No Wait and bar hopped around Noda while we waited. When we finally arrived for our seating, we had to move tables since the AC vent was leaking condensation on my head. The waiter was super gracious about it and moved us without worries or a fuss.  For drinks I got the Mint Julep and my husband got a beer. The Mint Julep was absolutely delicious and a beautiful presentation with the shaved ice.   To start, we ordered the biscuits and bacon jam. It was more like bacon jam gravy as it covered the biscuits. An order came with two and they were absolutely delicious. In addition, we ordered 3 chicken tenders (they are sold individually which was cool), the hot side of the day (a squash casserole), mac n cheese, and sweet potato dumplings. Out of this list, I have a really hard time picking my favorite. The chicken was cooked so nicely. The dumplings had this butter taste that just made the dish. The squash casserole was such a surprise and well seasoned. The mac n cheese was everything we expected plus a bit more. We got smalls on everything and were both able to have a full plate of food.   I was also surprised with the price to value. Our total bill with drinks and tip came to around $50.   We will absolutely be returning!",

Their extensive cocktail list and liquors make it a nice place to sit down and nosh of a few items and be perfectly fine. It's perfect for a family brunch or a nice date night with the significant other.   Their fried chicken is why you go (chicken tenders especially)... but the sweet potatoes gnocchi is why you will come back... I didn't order them the first time I went and I'm regretting it ever since. The sage and brown butter pair perfectly with the doughtiness of the gnocchi. Anything home pickled there is also amazeballs. Their home made sauces are delicious.  The only problem with this place is the parking... Noda is notorious for limited parking, but for Haberdish, it's worth it.",

    "text": "The food here is quite good. Only the inattentive service and a disingenuous move on the menu prevent me from giving Haberdish five stars.  We decided to visit Haberdish on a Sunday night. It was busy, unsurprising given the hubbub online about the place. We used Yelp to get onto the waitlist, and when we arrived fifty minutes later, we still were back in the queue for a table. Things cleared out after the last football game ended, however, and we were seated no long after that.  Others have spilt much Yelp ink about the decor, so I won't delve too far into there. Suffice it to say that it's a modern rustic look. I especially loved the exposed beams in the ceiling. Apparently, a furniture maker converted some of the wood from the original ceiling into the tables at which we were now sitting. Pretty cool.  We ordered the kale salad, chicken tenders, and the trout. Everything was really, really delicious. The kale salad was finely chopped, the citrus fresh, and the salad sparsely dressed (which, with a thick dressing like pomegranate molasses here, I appreciate). My wife tells me the chicken tenders were, well, tender. The trout was also excellent: moist, full of flavor. It could have used a little less oil in the bath on the plate on which it was served, but that's a small gripe.  The service was less stellar. Our waiter was friendly, but absent. After we ordered, we barely saw him. Water refills? Not so much. Around the time our food arrived, he told me he'd bring me a refill on my ginger ale. I finally saw that refill about the time the check came, some twenty or thirty minutes later.   And then there's the shenanigans with the whiskey list. It's not bad, although not as extensive as, say, Midwood Smokehouse. But the prices are a ruse. There's a price listed next to each whiskey. Fine, that's normal. But hidden at the top, there's a qualifier, that goes something like this:  Neat, rocks, up: +3 Cocktails: +4  Well, that's confusing. This qualifier isn't readily apparent--I had looked at the list for five minutes before noticing it. (Maybe I'm just dumb--that's a possibility.)  I asked the waiter. Apparently, the price listed is for a shot of the whiskey, or if one orders the whiskey with cola or soda water.  Now, this is just disingenuous. That price could work if the whiskey list consisted of Jack and Crown, as sure, those are mixers or shooters. But Jefferson's Oceans (a really excellent bourbon, by the way), is neither. I assume that no one is having a Jefferson's Ocean with Coke, or no bachelor party is coming in and downing five shots of it. It's drank neat or on the rocks, as are many--probably 95%--of the whiskies on their list. 95% of those whiskies will be ordered neat or on the rocks. Surprise! You just spent extra money.  Put another way, I order whiskey out a lot, and I've never--never!--seen a restaurant try to pull this one off. In New York, it would get a restaurant ran out of town. Just imagine the Brandy Library trying to pull this one off.  That's not enough to knock the restaurant down more than a star, though. Avoid the overpriced, dishonest whiskey pricing and come for the great food.",

Though this, is a lover none like the rest.  I ventured to Haberdish for an early dinner and fell completely in love! I'm a sucker for a well-designed space and loved the rustic modern feel Haberdish exuded, especially in its unexpected (though charming) NoDa community. Every dish provided adventure and a sense of anxiousness as almost nothing was as I perceived. From the Smoked Deviled Eggs to the Dill & Scallion Trout and the Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese (special of the day), each dish simply titillated my taste buds and kept me yearning more. I would also recommend the Sweet Potato Dumplings and Hush Puppies that came with a magical Sweet Tea Butter Spread. I loved the flavor of the Pork Shank, but it fell on the dry side and took a bit away from the dish. The only dish I truly wouldn't recommend is the lackluster Fried Chicken (White Meat), which was underwhelming and left my palate desiring more (especially in comparison to the others). Nonetheless I had an amazing \"feast\" I would say, and can't wait to return to try the infamous Kale Grits!",

I want to take my parents here, I want to go here with my friends, I want to order more menu items, I just want Haberdish to continue.  Nikki said it best when she said southern meets swanky. This is real southern food with a definite upscale twist. Using yelp's waitlist app, The Lady and I came here on a Friday night. Expect a wait, anywhere from 45 minutes to an 1:15. You can go somewhere else to get apps or drinks before, you'll survive ;)  We were seated outside, which was our preference because it was a nice night. The outside corridor is lit from the top and has bug screens, making it actually pretty cozy. There's a small open patio at the back end with couches and cushions and all the things you need if you're just grabbing a drink there. However, we were serious about the food.  The cocktail list is seriously extensive and well crafted, so we had to think about it a bit. We ended up with a punch, and a spicy drink that I unfortunately can't remember. Minus 10 points to Haberdish for not having their drink menu online. Anyways, for dinner, we started off with the biscuits with bacon jam, which was insane. Even the semi-vegetarian Lady loved it.  For the main meal, I ordered the Half Smoked Chicken (4 pcs) with the Alabama White Sauce (idk what that is but it was damn amazing) and the lady ordered the Cauliflower Steak with the Chimichurri sauce. I've never had cauliflower taste so good. You could easily taste the smoke in the chicken, and that's what made it so memorable.  For sides, we got the sweet potato dumplings, which were alright, and the mac and cheese, which was rich and delicious. Awesome.  Service was on point, and I can't wait to come back and try more drinks, as well as more food. And honestly, even with so much food and cocktails, it wasn't a bad bill considering. Haberdish has won me over just from one visit. Can't *wait* to come back.",

Pimento cheese was good-not the biggest fan of it, but theirs makes for a nice appetizer. Especially with green apples. Had the smoked chicken with Alabama White Sauce. Not sure if that is the True BBQ sauce of AL, but whatever-- it was the best, most delicious chicken I have ever had, HANDS DOWN  Eye-rolling good. The way it was cooked, seasoned, prepared, they know what they are doing chicken-wise here. My husband had the ribs which he ate every bit of, but after the tasting the chicken, knew what he would get next time. The kale grits were delicious. Didn't love the carrot side, it had too much going on (keep veggies simple, sauce & sesame oil is to much). We were in a food coma afterwards. Big tip: use the NOWAIT app. They don't take reservations but do use that, and it helped us get a table without dawdling outside for an hour or more. Will be back for sure.

    "text": "Amazing. We arrived with a large party of 7 and checked in about 645 on their app, arrived at 7, and were seated around 745. I think if we had 6 or less people we wouldn't have waited half as long. Our group grabbed drinks at the bar and hung out on the porch until we were seated and it wasn't a problem.   We ordered most of the menu between our group and it was overall really delicious.   Price point is great. We tried as hard as we could to 'ball out' because it was my birthday and our bill for just food no drinks for my husband and I was only $55 after tax and tip and i have a full box of leftovers. You could easily get out of here for less than $40 for a couple and be stuffed, which isn't common for restaurants of this quality in Charlotte.  Highlights:  fried chicken - best I've had cauliflower steak - GET THIS. its covered in chimichurri and its amazing. sweet potato dumplings - more like gnocchi, and GOOD. cornbread pudding - RICH, you dont need a big portion hushpuppies - the sweet butter on the side, yum.  Wouldnt get again:  house dill pickles - perfectly good but plain, next time ill try the special. mac and cheese - More of a saucy style, i prefer baked. kale salad - I love kale salads and this one was just okay to me, dressing lacked flavor.  Smoked potato salad: smoke was really strong  Kind waitstaff and bartenders, beautiful interiors (I especially love the vanity in the womens bathroom - beautiful!), worth a visit!",

I've tried enough to say that Haberdish does it best. My friends and I stopped by before their grand opening night, and went family style with their sides of mac 'n cheese, kale grits, tater tots, charred okra (personal favorite) and kale salad. Everything was spectacular. We also ordered chicken tenders at $2/each, which were lightly fried and delightfully succulent.   If you're not in the mood for food, Haberdish also has a selection of craft cocktails and a cozy bar that reminds of The Coupe in DC. I highly recommend the Black Manhattan. If I remember correctly, the bartenders added cherry-vanilla bitters using a medicine dropper. Their recipes are precise, and their drinks are worth going for.",

Food: we ate the biscuits and bacon jam, the pork shank, the fried chicken and the mojito icecream. I really really enjoyed everything we ate! we sort of expected something to not be up to the mark (cause you know, how can everything be great), but everything was amazing  2. Service: the service is really good. The food came within minutes, the servers were nice and helpful.   Overall, very happy with the place and the $$ you pay for things. Will surely return.   If you have a wait time to get your table, remember to not go across the street to Whiskey and Wine- those guys are crooks.",

They offer so many unique cocktails and even punch bowls for bigger crowds. I take all of my visitors here and they still talk about Haberdish and how amazing their experience was. Pro tip: my boyfriend and I get a whole chicken even though there are just two of us. It makes great leftovers. The best side dish is their cornbread pudding and we always get the kale salad. Definitely share everything. You wouldn't get to taste everything if you ordered a meal for yourself. They use Nowait if you don't want to wait in line and if you find yourself waiting, grab a seat at the bar, get a pre dinner donut at reigning donuts around the corner (we have actually done this) or grab a drink at the common market a few blocks away.",

I saw that you could put yourself on the wait list via Yelp (!)... done and done. Parking can be a pain, but if you know the secret spots around NoDa you'll be fine. After checking in with the hostess, I made my way to the beautiful bar to order a cocktail. I decided on the Manhattan, which was deliciously crafted. The interior area was a little crazy and cramped but people were very polite and courteous. I grabbed my drink and made my way out to the front patio area. When my table was ready, they sent a text to my phone.   In terms of food, I ordered the smoked deviled eggs, biscuits with bacon jam, chicken tenders, fried chicken, mac-n-cheese, brocollini with pancetta, and okra with bacon jam. The fried chicken was jammin'. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The chicken tenders were nicely breaded and the ranch was delicious. I was pretty happy with everything. I honestly don't know what would make this place 5-stars for me, but it just wasn't. Maybe a second trip will get that 5th star.",

Start to finish, everything was phenomenal. The lighting, the details, the open space -- the ambiance was great.   We didn't know what to expect of the portions, but the waitress was knowledgable and advised that between two of us, the \"half fried chicken\" would fill us up. And she was right. It included one wing, one drumstick, one thigh and one breast. (And if I heard correctly, I think you can specify which pieces you want.) We were indifferent, so that's what we were brought!   We skipped appetizers, although the pimento cheese ball next to us look awesome and I plan to order it next time. Along with the fried chicken, we ordered the large mac n' cheese and the small cornbread pudding. Both were amazingly delicious. The cornbread pudding especially had lots of flavors going on. Cheesy, herby, and very moist. We just so happened to everything we ordered, but someone else may have had leftovers -- oops! :)   All in all, Haberdish was a win. I love when the experience is that enjoyable from start to finish. I hear they are all about the cocktails. We stuck with IPA's, but they did look fancy! Just GO! You won't be disappointed.",

I've never really gotten the concept of this dish, but I'm glad I tried it here.  The portion size is a perfect appetizer or light meal.    I was given the option of breast or thigh de-boned.  I chose the thigh.  The crisp on the chicken was, for me, perfect.  Dark, but not burned, flour-dusted, not breaded... juicy meat.  I love that type of fried chicken.    The waffle was large with a slightly sweet batter that was more creamy cake than fluffy, which again, I like with a normal press on the waffle.  I had the choice of maple syrup or their own honey syrup which was fabulous... great orange blossom honey and spun sugar taste.  Yum.  It all went together so well and the portions were perfect down the last bite of chicken and waffle.  Why did I wait so long?",

    "text": "When creating our restaurant list for our recent day trip to Charlotte. we selected Haberdish as our first spot. For a quick brunch, we shared a fried chicken biscuit sandwich and a potato hash bowl. The biscuit sandwich was spectacular: perfectly fried and seasoned chicken, topped with a crispy sweet slaw on a buttery, golden brown biscuit. We can't rave about it enough! Unfortunately, they were out of the country ham, so we'll have to plan another trip to try the ham biscuit. The hash bowl was so delicious: chorizo, tender sweet potatoes, roasted peppers, poached eggs, and a generous drizzle of a sour cream based sauce. Our server was inattentive; when we entered the restaurant he walked straight past us. We had to ask if he worked there, and then he seated us. A couple arrived promptly after us and they seated themselves at a table adjacent to ours outside. About 15 minutes passed and they were not approached, while we received water. We gave them our menus, and they flagged down a server. Overall, the food was excellent and we're excited to return.",

I'm not even sure why they would do that. Fortunately the chicken meat was great and their side dishes and cocktails are phenomenal. I'm sure their other main course items are great. However if I'm going to indulge in fried chicken, it needs to include delicious fried skin. I'll be back, just not for the fried chicken.",

    "text": "Holy Haberdish Batman, this place definitely lives up to the hype and then some.  Originally I had come here the other week with a large group (16 peeps) and they were able to seat us all at one table because we arrived for an early dinner [had a show to attend later].  I was so occupied with getting everyone there on time, I really missed out on trying the food.  Never-the-less, I came back with a smaller group this time.  A Thursday evening, and the wait for a table was an hour... so we braved it on their heated patio (which I had no idea they had when I came here the first time).  It actually worked out and we had a great dinner.  This patio space is going to be amazing once the weather gets warmer... they have these large sliding barn doors (naturally closed for the winter) but I could see the space really opening up and bringing the outside in.  Haberdish doesn't take reservations, but you can use the NoWait App to see how long the wait is also put your name down and see yourself move up in the queue... once you get called/texted, you have 10min to claim your table.  I was with other yelpers and we totally over ordered, but the food was super good.  And it was a fun evening taking photos of all the dishes:  tenders, mac & cheese with chicken skins, glazed carrots, kale grits, tots, okra, butter pickles, hush puppies, sweet potato dumplings, cornbread pudding, and coleslaw.  The real gems that stood out were the carrots and kale grits which totally blew us away and were nice unexpected treats in comparison to everything else that was super tasty.  Cocktails are Haberdish's thing as well.  I tried the Xmas Mule which was delicious and super photogenic.  Despite being super slammed, we were still greeted very warmly and even greeted on our way out...our server did a great job splitting our check since we shared everything and she did tempt us with dessert, but we were all full to the brim with food and drink.",

They happen to not have a wait on the Sunday morning when we got there, but that quickly changed as they filled up soon after. Parking is terrible, as it typically is in NoDa, so plan accordingly.  Some of my friends started with some coffee, which was served in a thermos. They weren't huge fans of the thermos and pouring it themselves. I order the chicken and waffles, while others at the table ordered biscuits with bacon jam and chicken tenders. The chicken and waffles was great, and they allow the option to choose the type of fried chicken that you like(tenders, white, dark) to go with your waffles. They have several sauces for the tenders, most of which are good. Service wasn't the best here, but food was definitely really good. The hushpuppies were light and fluffy and the chicken was fried to perfection. The bacon jam tasted like a bacon hash sort of, which I was a fan of on the biscuit. All in all, I'd visit again for brunch with a hope of slightly speedier service.",

This would be a great spot for a birthday, and fun drinks with friends. I went here with my uncle the other day and we both had chicken and waffles. OMG! This had to be some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. It was so crispy and flavorful. The waffle seemed like a realllll belgian waffle. The syrup was extra sweet and rich.   The food was amazing! The only thing I don't quite understand is why they serve brunch only on the weekdays. I was looking forward to a good brunch menu, but was told that there is NO brunch on weekends, but they always serve chicken and waffles. Maybe they missed the memo that we brunch on weekends? Not sure, but I do hope they change this.",

    "text": "We went in for brunch on a Friday and were able to grab a table without a problem. We camped out there for a good part of the day getting some work done and there were always some open tables around us. We sat on their covered patio and it was a great place to enjoy some fresh air, but still be cozy on a late fall day. They have heaters out there that they were happy to turn on until the sun warmed up the place a bit more.   The brunch menu was super southern and an interesting mix of things. You don't really see the traditional brunch items on there, but you can order eggs any way and add in all sorts of sides. My group shared a bunch of small plates and sides and by the time the mains came I was already pretty full. The mac and cheese with crispy chicken skin was awesome, would definitely get that again. The cinnamon roll was good, but I'm not sure I'd order it again. The hushpuppies were some of the best I've ever had, super light and flavorful (light considering it is still a fried ball of dough). The kale salad and pickles were tasty as well. For my main I got the bone broth chicken soup. The broth was super tasty, a little too many veggies for my taste as it was hard to get a big spoonful of broth with some many thick veggies in the way. The beet tartine was also a hit as well as the chicken tenders!   On to the cocktails! You can just take a look at the photos and see they take their cocktails seriously. Ice cube flowers anyone? A few of us were between the traditional Bloody Mary and the yellow bloody Mary. Our waitress explained them both to us and offered to bring a sample of each so we could try it. I ended up going for the yellow bloody Mary, it tasted fresh and lighter than your usual. The rest of the cocktails ordered at our table were a hit as well. Overall just an awesome place to hit up!",

All were excellent but the mac n cheese was a stand out. When asked \"what is your favorite restaurant in Charlotte\" my answer is always Haberdish.  Chicken tenders were juicy and the sauces were all great. Sweet potato dumplings had great consistency and the pudding was great.   The atmosphere was perfect with relaxing house music, dim (but not too dim) lighting (complete with Edison lightbulbs) and great service.   Colleen is incredible behind the bar and her cocktails are creative and delicious. This is not a restaurant to miss and I always take out of towners here as well. It's a great encapsulation of the Charlotte restaurant scene.",

At 10am, only a few tables were occupied, so we opted to sit in the semi-outdoors patio area off the main dining room.   Our server (I think her name was Carolina!) was beyond sweet and accommodating to our many beverage and food requests. I started with a classic bloody mary and later enjoyed a smoked mint julep, both of which I'd highly recommend. I love that the coffee is served in a thermos, which keeps it pretty hot for a while.   We shared a few plates to start, including pickles, hushpuppies and a cinnamon roll. I can't speak to the cinnamon roll (though it looked delicious) but I can definitely say that the hushpuppies were the best I've ever had. Haberdish serves theirs with sweet tea butter, which was phenomenal, and even more so with a dash of the housemade hot sauce.   My main plate consisted of the egg biscuit sandwich, a chicken tender, mac and cheese with spicy/crispy chicken skins, and some kale salad. Delicious! This was the southern meal I showed up for!   I had to practically roll myself to the airport after our brunch. I'll be eating clean all week to make amends, but it was totally worth it!",

    "text": "UPDATE: came back again and had a FANTASTIC experience. Jen was my bartender, and not only was she super attentive, but she even took the time to ask my name after I ordered my first drink and continued to address me by first name thereafter. She was clearly doing it on her own volition, which goes a very loooong way with me.   That said, humans are humans. It's hard for me to pass judgment on my first experience because you never know what people are dealing with or going through in any given moment.   But I can say with confidence, that this time, I thoroughly enjoyed the smoked chicken, okra, and deviled eggs. Jen also made PERFECT manhattans.   So I'm giving an enthusiastic, well-deserved , revised 5 stars ((mostly for Jen!))",

I ordered the waffle and chicken. I was expecting actual chicken not chicken tender style chicken but they were actually very good. For my 98 year old grandmother I ordered her the grits and chicken, shocked when they brought them out because my god the grits were green , come to find out they were kale grits. I was not expecting that and my granny is super picky about her food and doesn't like change at all. So me being me trying to disguise the fact that they are green I'm trying to distract her while she's eating them so she will not have a cow about them being green. Well the distraction only lasted but so long , she actually liked them so hey what do u know maybe she is starting to like change. Yaye for granny. To top things off my pretty super girly drink with a rose ice cube in it was very refreshing to bad I can't quite remember the name of it.",

For the restaurant to not be that busy, service was very slow. We ordered off the \"snack\" menu which we assumed to be the appetizer menu, and even asked for the hush puppies to be brought out before our meal. However, they came out with our meal that took quite some time as well. Once receiving our meal we were not impressed at all. For the stellar reviews the restaurant received the experience and food were subpar and very underwhelming. We won't be returning. A waste of $87",

The place was great, we had the hush puppies, biscuits and jam, large okra, mac and cheese, chicken tenders and waffle sundae. Everything was delicious but by far the best item on the menu kale salad!   The atmosphere of the restaurant was very similar to the NoDa environment being hipster/trendy. Our waiter was great, checked up on us every couple of minutes and made sure that we didn't run out of coffee or water. Its definitely a great place for breakfast, lunch or a good old brunch!",

I travel here for work a couple of times a month and always like to try new places and neighborhoods, when I do.    Tonight's adventure brought us to NoDa, my favorite of the neighborhoods.  It's only a few blocks worth of real estate but NoDa packs alot of interesting shops, breweries and dining spots into it's footprint.    Haberdish has a stylish but sparse decor and an expansive bar in the main room.  We sat in the heated patio area which was very comfortable in spite of a chill in the air - I imagined that the outside table options would be bustling on a warm night.  Carolina was our server and she was excellent - she gave us a brief tour of the menu and highlighted a few cocktails and dishes that Haberdish is known for.     We started out with a glass of Proseco and a Negroni cocktail - not one of their signature cocktails but expertly made, nonetheless.  I loved the glassware and the whimsical touches they added, my second cocktail had a carnation frozen into the ice sphere and a bunch of babies-breath clothes-pinned to the edge of the glass.    Our food choices included the Cheese Straws as a starter - they were tasty with a good amount of jalapeno.  We also tried the Chicken Tenders with some Kale Grits and the Savory Corn Bread Pudding as our sides.  I'm sure we were drawing some very strange looks from the surrounding tables as we dove into the first few bites of our food...everything was so delicious our eyes were rolling back in our heads!!  The tenders were large, we ordered four and couldn't finish them all.  The small versions of the side dishes were also very generous for two people to share.  We didn't want to overdo it so we could order the Buttermilk ice cream for dessert - it was also spectacular!  I will be back in Charlotte for another business trip in two weeks and you can bet, Haberdish will be on the agenda - I can't wait to go back.",

My word their cocktail menu is divine, absolutely loved the Pineapple Spiced Rum Punch cocktail! This is a lovely venue, spacious and modern and really lovely service.  We went for brunch and had a lot of catching up to do so were there for hours and never once did we feel like anyone wanted us to go, just kept coming back for more cocktail orders.. oh wait, actually, maybe they're evil! :) Haberdish staff, thank you for making us feel welcome. On the food front, we ordered a starter of Hushpuppies. Made of cornmeal and served with sweet tea butter.. so good! Then, I had chicken & waffles. You had a choice of the type of chicken aka.. tenders or thigh. Tick here. Dining partner had the cauliflower and it was droolworthy! We also had the kale salad and mac n cheese as sides. Didn't quite finish all that.. not through lack of trying! I highly recommend this venue, even if just for that amazing cocktail (aka cocjtau) list! Thank you team Haberdish!",

It was moist and the skin crispy - all around good flavor. The sides were pretty good too (mac n cheese, charred okra w/bacon jam on the side).

Haberdish is a cool trendy restaurant, filling a great need in Charlotte: southern food worth waiting for. That said, the service......needs some help. Last night, we were told we were next up to be seated. We asked about the open table for four and were told that we could have it only after someone on the list didn't show. Their time would expire in another 30 minutes. 30 minutes go by, all with an open table, and we are told that we can now have the table because they found the person a better table in a different part of the restaurant. You read that right: the person who doesn't show up for the reservation gets a better table while they sit us, who have been waiting for 90 minutes at the table that had been reserved for the guy who hadn't shown up for his reservation after 30 minutes. Then, then service was meh. They didn't bring plates for the starters (which were delicious), even after asking. Then, they brought the food (mostly very good), but didn't offer dinner plates. We had to ask, again. They are busy. Really busy. They should be proud of what their chefs are producing. And it may be time for more staff or \"all hands on deck\" on a Saturday night. Still, a very good restaurant, with delicious food and a fun atmosphere.",

She also noticed one of my friends didn't eat her rice pudding and asked if she didn't like it. My friend hesitated because she didn't want to be negative but we did confirm that she didn't really enjoy it so the waitress took it off the bill. Completely unprompted! Lastly, they offered us three free desserts for our birthday celebration also unprompted!  I would come back just because of the service but the food was great. The appetizers were awesome but the pimento cheese ball really stood out. I got the chicken breast and wing combo which was well seasoned. The desserts were awesome especially the banana pudding. I also ordered a side of tater tots which I enjoy crispier than they made it but it was still good. Overall, impressed!",

I've been to NYC once and they have some cool looking restaurants with good food so I did my research and picked this place for them. They were just as impressed as I was, good atmosphere and great food. Big portions for a really good price. Fried chicken was amazing, hushpuppies were great, and so were the tater tots. Their tenders were okay. Also got the Black Manhattan, strong and delicious. Definitely will come back to try more!",

My wife and I went with another couple while we were in Charlotte for a show.  Seemed nice enough, and the staff was great.  We started with some appetizers.  Cheese Straws (my favorite thing we ordered), deviled eggs (I didn't have any not a fan), and hush puppies.  My wife ordered the two piece chicken and Mac n Cheese.  I odored like a child (partially because nothing jumped out at me on the menu) $10 meal of Chicken tenders and tater tots... Our friends ordered cauliflower steak, kale grits, charred okra and corn pudding.  None of us finished our meals. They were prepared well, but none of it was good enough to stuff ourselves.  Other than the cheese straws my favorite was their house made habanero hot sauce.  Everything was just a bit underwhelming except for the bill.  You can see by my review's I'm not afraid to spend money on good food, but I've had way better meals in Charlotte.",

It manages to lift fried chicken from a fun hole in the wall usual experience to fine dining with a juicy and incredibly seasoned dish served alongside \"done up\" versions of traditional southern sides (get the Mac and cheese with chicken skins!). Their take on biscuits with bacon jam also amounts to a delicious warm buttery biscuit smothered in hot gravy with bacon bits.  The cocktail menu is also extensive and utilizes more southern ingredients like honey in a number of their drinks. The best part about Haberdish is that you can come with a group to one of the most renowned restaurants in the city, fill the table with plates of fried chicken, sides, hush puppies, and deviled eggs and walk out for under $30-40 a person. There's just no better place to go in Charlotte for a True southern comfort fine dining experience!",

We had some errands to do in and around NoDa so seemed like the right time for Saturday brunch at Haberdish and it wound up being a good decision.  There wasn't a chance that I was not going to try the fried chicken so my wife and I split half a bird with her wing/breast Yin matching up with my leg/thigh Yang perfectly.  We also got a waffle which was served with both regular and slightly spicy maple syrup and a small shaker of their house made habenero hot sauce which is delicious with good flavor teamed with the heat.  It all came out hot and steamy with crunchy, perfectly juicy chicken and a fresh waffle.  It's not breaking news that chicken and waffles are a thing and Haberdish pulled off the iconic dish well.  We had a couple cocktails including my first ever blonde bloody Mary made with the mix made from yellow tomatoes.  Apparently they're known for a good and inventive cocktail program and I was happy with my choice.  Service was good and the entire meal set the stage for an easy  decision to get back there soon.",

We were so pleased with everything actually more than pleased with everything we've tried on our two visits except the dumpling appetizer which wasn't at all as we expected BUT not bad enough to even change my 5 star review. Okay so we had a little variety of things. Our first visit was on Fathers Day 2018 and my husband and I just went back for DateNight November 2018.  Our toddler had the kids Mac n Cheese and Tater Tots on the side. The kids meal is a pretty nice size which was perfect for our toddler as he had left overs. My husband had the fried chicken which he said was the best Fried Chicken he has had in Charlotte, that title use to be held by Cajun Yard Dog in his book but he has now removed that standing and given the title to HaberDish.  I've found the PERFECT Vegan dinner option here and boy am I Excited, this awesomeness is in the form of a Cauliflower Steak. This think packs flavor and I mean real FLAVOR. I had a side Kale salad which was extremely tasty. My husband had the Mac n Cheese with chicken skin and the sweet potato dumpling.  This is definitely a place we will frequent , give em a try",

Arrived earlier than the time told us on app and they seated us right away (early). Ordered a few beers but want to try their fancy cocktails next time. Deviled eggs were good and so was the pimento cheese with fried crackers. Apples with pimento cheese app was a nice new touch. Dinner - shared a few big sides, too much food! Chicken tenders were amazing and huge, no joke. Plenty of leftovers. Not a fan (that night) of their cornbread pudding but definitely want to try diff sides next time.

We walked in and with no waiting, were welcomed and seated at a table in the middle of everything where we could see the dining rooms and the food coming out from the kitchen. We could see the long bar and nicely appointed back area. This place knows and celebrates its textile manufacturing history-  beautiful wood, mill spools for bar seats, so nice to enjoy the ambience.  On the menu- Plenty of snacks, light bites and main meals to choose from including Cauliflower steak, Trout, Ribs, hush puppies, crisp and juicy chicken tenders, and deviled eggs.  We were actually there for coffee and dessert but had to try some other good food treats.  All tasty, seasoned, hot and fresh.  Sonker--- oh yes!! Like a fruit crumble or pie, mine was fried apples with a sweet cream- like a caramel sauce on the side that made it perfect. The chocolate Sheet Cake with raspberry sauce made my eyes water - all so Good.  We don't know a lot about Southern food (from SF, CA) but we are fans now. We'll come back to enjoy to other choices on the menu and a custom cocktail !",

A quick look at the daily specials and menu warranted that I try the Daily Fruit special consisting of Macerated Strawberries over Carolina Gold Rice with benne seeds. Fruit over rice? The waitress shared that it was a breakfast bowl so I had to have it. I was NOT disappointed. Oh, my! The warmth of this dish filled my soul with joy! I also ordered the Kale Salad (half size) which was tastefully prepared with halo-type oranges, benne (sesame seeds), goat cheese, and pomegranate molasses dressing. Delicious! Both dishes were tapas style but without the cocktail. After my meal, I was a happy camper the rest of the day.  The restaurant has an extensive cocktail menu that will let you get your weekend started off right!  Overall, a great meal with great service.  Oh, they have a nice outdoor patio area as well (see photo). Can't wait to return for more delectable dishes.",

Landed at 10 pm in Charlotte and fired up Yelp as soon as I could take my phone off airplane mode. Wasn't able to find a ton of late night food, but luckily Haberdish was still going strong with an open kitchen until midnight. We were seated immediately and promptly ordered the aforementioned old fashioned and a local IPA.   Their menu is what my Southern partner calls \"Southern nouveau\" and we ordered allllllll of the things. Specifically fried chicken, kale grits, deviled eggs, and okra. The chicken was so fresh and paired perfectly with their house made habenero sauce. My only complaint was that they came around and collected our hot sauce mid meal, as it was obviously someone's task before they headed out at the end of the night.  Lovely ambiance and service made it an easy five stars for me. The area Haberdish is located in seemed eclectic and lively--would love to explore another time when I'm less sleepy and full of chicken.",

    "text": "The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because of location and atmosphere. Let's start with the drinks. At first it looks like you have a normally priced spirit list, if you read the fine print in the upper corner, it is 3 dollars more e pensive for them to just pour the liquor in a glass, 4 dollars more for a mixed drink. This is quite the shady approach to price gouging, because no one would pay 15 dollars for a shot of buffalo trace but that's how they sneak it in there. What can I do to not get this charge? I guess ask them to pour it down my throat.  The food, for sure not as great as everyone has said in reviews. The hushpuppies were bland. And the sweet tea butter was not impressive. Didnt add to the hushpuppies at all. I got the chicken tenders and waffle and while I loved the waffle, the chicken came out dry. The breading doesnt stick to the chicken and the plate was slippery so it was almost hard to even get a piece on my fork. The ribs were underwhelming and bland, covering up poor smoke with lots of bbq sauce, the sauce def was sweet baby Ray's. The collards were delicious. Wasnt super impressed with the tater tots, bland and unsalted and didnt have anything set them across for being \"handmade\". The worst part of it all was the banana pudding. It was for sure made the night before if not long before. They put the whipped cream on and put it in the freezer . The lack of freshness and the minimal amount of wafers was sad. It really was some of the worst banana pudding in the south. They should be embarrassed for serving that here in the south. For sure not will NOT be back. I'll be down the street at better establishments.",

    "text": "Haberdish has been on the bucket list for a LONG time but he stars have never alligned for a meal there. We finally made it in for a late Saturday lunch when we had some guests in town. First impression was I love the openness of it and the covered patio on the side. The walls are made of brick and beautiful wide tables. We started with the bacon jam biscuits and hushpuppies. Both are great \"southern\" Foods and they know how to do them right. The bacon jam is more of a marinade, with nice crunchy chunks of bacon over the fluffy biscuits. The hush puppies are served with a sweet tea butter, which looks like tuna fish but tastes amazing and soft.   Both appetizers were enjoyed by our group. The menu is very small, which is my only complaint. I'm not sure if the dinner menu is bigger, but it's basically fried chicken, fried cauliflower steaks and a bunch of side options. So, obviously this place doesn't attract those who don't love fried chicken.   The fried chicken is very good. You can order tenders (2.50 each) or half chicken. Sides include Mac n cheese, kale salad, biscuits, and a few other options. We tried the Kale salad and Mac n cheese. I also have the cauliflower steak a try, which is \"chicken fried\" with plenty of fried batter. It was okay, not my favorite but I was curious about it and wanted to give it a try.  They have an amazing and extensive cocktail list, with various creative and craft choices. I went with the seasonal doc porters vodka base with watermelon juice. Delicious! We all loved the cocktails we tried. I'd love to come back for dinner or brunch but love the whole atmosphere.",

    "text": "I was a bit wary of all the good ratings, as I've fallen for this a few times and was sorely disappointed. Not at Haberdish!!   We went on a Tuesday night with my in-laws and we were seated immediately. The room inside was absolutely packed, which just shows you how popular the place is really. It was an ordinary Tuesday night after all!  The wait staff was very attentive and immediately brought us waters and took drinks orders. We also ordered a starter (deviled eggs) once we had our drinks, and our mains once we had the starter.   Now to the food: GREAT! We shared the smoked deviled eggs first and they were on point. I love deviled eggs, so I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to them. ;-) My father-in-law had the 2 pieces of white chicken, which were HUGE! He took home half of it! We also ordered a bunch of sides between the four of us and we loved all of them (kale grits, sweet potato dumplings, mac n cheese, bbq-glazed carrots, and the charred okra). The okra was absolutely fantastic! Definitely try it!   Now, my one potential point of criticism is that I feel everything is a tiny tad too salty. You don't notice it at first, but after eating for a bit, we all were very thirsty and it actually takes away from the unique flavors a bit. A little less salt and everything would be even better!   Overall, five stars on all counts. Service, ambiance, drinks, food, location. Perfect!",

    "text": "Three of us went to have a lunch on Sunday. As expected, there were people waiting outside(They don't take any reservations)   Even I saw a couple of tables available for new customers while waiting, customers were not seated right away. I am not sure if it is part of marketing to show some customers waiting on a line or something, anyway we were seated at the right exact table that was empty an hour ago.   Finally after seated, we ordered hush puppies, chicken and waffle, biscuit and potato salad(cold side dish). Hush puppies were so great with sweet tea butter that comes with. The chicken was very crispy and tender inside. The waffle was mediocre. I enjoyed potato salad. Pickled onion and bacon was balanced well in the salad. Generally the food was great but it took so long for the food to be served.   If you are patient enough to wait for 3 hours meal(1hour table waiting, 1hour food waiting, 1 hour eating), it will be worthy to try!",

I ordered the pineapple spiced rum punch and it was so delicious. My friend did the bartender's choice and the drink they came up for her based on her preferences was so good. We also got the okra, hushpuppies, kale salad, macaroni and cheese and chicken tenders. The okra is a must try and the hushpuppies were perfect. I ended up getting a second drink and did the bartender's choice and it was great. I will definitely be back.   The only downfall which isn't even worth taking off a star is that I did order the deviled eggs and they never came out. I would have like to try them but I'll have to save it for next time!",

The atmosphere here is excellent and the entire staff is as friendly as they come.  The time they take to explain the menu is great and their recommendations were spot on.   Start with the hushpuppies.  They are excellent and the butter with them make them to die for.  The fried chicken is excellent and so are the chicken tenders.  The breading makes them so delicious.  When it comes to picking sides I legit think they all are excellent.  We tried four, however our favorites were the sweet potatoes dumplings and Mac and cheese.  The cost is not bad for all his great food.  Go there and enjoy yourself because a food coma is coming soon",

The patio looks awesome. They have a great cocktail and beer list. The prices are really reasonable, so you can try a lot of the different 'snacks' and sides. We got the hushpuppies and deviled eggs as appetizers. The hushpuppies were AMAZING - Sweet and salty and the I could've eaten the dipping butter with a spoon. My husband and I both got chicken tenders. They were really good, but I would probably get a piece of chicken next time. The homemade habanero pepper sauce is really good. We got mac n cheese, tots, and charred okra. All were delicious! Make sure you get the banana pudding to seal the deal!",

Her the white meat, me the tenders.  So damn tasty.  We had the roasted okra, mac and cheese, smoked deviled eggs, and tater tots in accompaniment.  All were extremely satisfying.  Those smoked deviled eggs are insane and my lady loves the okra. We made our second pass tonight with her mother.  Luckily, we got there early as the place was pretty full by 730.  The ladies stuck with what we knew on sides and chicken.  I ventured over to the pork shank.  The portions were all of a healthy size and everything was delicious.  We added the daily special pickled beets as well.  Tasty. They have the same ambitious sort of cocktails from Colleen that they do at Crepe Cellar, with a solid beer and wine list. We also enjoyed the banana pudding and the ice cream of the day, a raspberry cheesecake. The decor is homey and inviting with the dishes coming out like they just came out of your grandmother's china cabinet.   This is a solid addition to the neighborhood with fantastic gourmet southern fair.  I cannot wait until spring when they open up the barn doors.",

    "text": "Had heard great things about Haberdish, but was even better than expected! I have grown wary of overpriced hipster \"share plates\" style dining (I.e. less food for more money), which seem to be most new trendy places in Charlotte. However, the prices here were reasonable, and the food was good, southern food (not a disappointing fusion). I had the hushpuppies, Mac and cheese, green bean casserole (special of the day), and, of course, the fried chicken. All but the Mac and cheese totally blew me away! The chicken was super flavorful, and crispy not greasy. The space and homage to the mill town heritage which NoDa came from is interesting and cool as well. I will definitely be back, and will try cocktails next time which I hear are great as well.",

We tried it today and everything from the silverware, to the food, to the tasteful bluegrass music playing at the perfect volume, to the overall ambience was impeccable. Our server, Jamie, was absolutely great!  She was attentive and helpful.  We ordered deviled eggs, (best I've ever had-a hint of horseradish) chicken and waffles, chicken tenders with all 3 sauces (ranch, BBQ, and honey mustard,-ranch was my favorite), tater tots (highly addictive) and the best sweet tea (just like my grandmas-made by Jamie) Thanks for a great experience Haberdish! We will definitely be back to try some other menu items.",

About fifteen minutes before they sat us, they sat two couples, one at each end of one of the 8 tops. Just seems like poor management/planning.

Three stars is all I could give the place. The inside of the place was nice. Funny thing, the receipt and credit card bill both had nothing about the place. No name, address, nothing.",

The brined, fried chicken is crispy and oh so delicious, throw on a bit of their hot sauce and bam. Every side dish we tried, and we almost tried them all, was stellar, meaning star like in and of itself. If you try one and you don't like it take your taste buds to the doctor for a check up. Lastly, eat dessert in waffle form! Keep Pounding and eat great in Charlotte by dropping by this NoDa spot.",

Kale salad was yummy! The waitress was excellent and frequently checked on us and refilled water. Luckily we checked in on No Wait... the wait was 2 hours when we arrived. Only thing was- it was a chilly night and they had the large door to the patio open which took away from the coziness. Will definitely be back (with a jacket)!",

Tip: Haberdish tends to fill up very quickly so add yourself to the waitlist on the Yelp app. If not, you could easily be waiting an hour plus on a Saturday night. It's that good!   We started off with the hush puppies and biscuits with bacon jam. The fried cornmeal dough with sweet tea butter is a taste of sweet southern heaven. We probably should have stopped here as the portions were quite large.  But we ordered more! had two fried chicken tenders ($2 each) which are brined, battered and fried and are surprisingly quite large. I love that their chicken comes from a local farm in NC (Springer Mountain Farms) where it is vegetarian-fed, hormone and antibiotic free. I also had a side of charred okra....a perfect compliment to the delicious, juicy fried chicken.  My friend ordered the pork shank which was more than enough for one person. It was cooked to perfection and had a smoky BBQ taste.   We also ordered the mac & cheese. Needless to say our eyes were too large and we brought home leftovers.   The atmosphere is lively and vibrant and has a diverse crowd of patrons. While we sat at the bar, there's both inside and outside dining.   Highly recommend Haberdish.",

We ordered a few side items and some of us got fried chicken and the others got chicken tenders. We didn't get a side item that we ordered. Not a biggie but would of been nice to try. By the time our server came, we already started eating our food so there was no point of asking and waiting for it. My husband also ordered a dipping sauce with his chicken tenders and he didn't get it. So we had to wait on our server and ask for it.   Overall, the experience was ok. I can't think of anything that was very memorable other than how pretty my drink was. The fried chicken was good, just not great or that special. My husband thought his chicken tenders were just ok because the breading was very thick and crumbly.",

Sweet potato dumplings will be probably very good warm with that nice taste of sage. Corn bread pudding wasn't what I expected but had a good taste. The fried chicken was really tasty, the batter was really good and crispy (sometimes too crispy/hard but overall very good). Didn't feel like trying desserts as we were cold and a bit disappointed as we had high expectations! Decor is really nice  I'll definitely give it another try if weather is nice outside!",

I put us in on a busy Saturday night before ordering the lyft, and ended up with around an hour to do some bar hopping before dinner. Estimate was a bit short, but no problem for us.  Drink menu and selection were rather impressive. I ended up going with a BBL stout and my wife chose a mint julep which featured great flavor and impressive presentation.  Regarding the menu, it is simple and small, but everything on there was intriguing. Yes, the fried chicken is amazing. Biggest surprise for me of the night was the sweet potato dumplings. Awesome flavor and texture. I would also recommend the biscuits and bacon jam - which was closer to biscuits and gravy IMO. I also feel you get a good bang for your buck. We split the meal (The sides are big enough to share) and our food bill was only 30. Glad they aren't overcharging and we were stuffed. We are definitely looking forward to coming back!",

    "text": "Southern inspired comfort food combined with excellent craft cocktails, framed in a \"order to share\" style restaurant. If you are from the North and you need to experience a nice intro to Southern food, try Haberdish.  From a native South Carolinian, I was excited to try out Haberdish's fried chicken and their take on Southern sides. The sweet potato dumplings are an interesting addition to the menu and pretty tasty, although I was not blown away. The grilled okra with bacon marmalade on top was pretty good as well (that's about as sexy as okra can get folks). Yet another interesting side, kale grits, which were good. I think I enjoy regular grits better though.   Saving the best for last...the biscuits and fried chicken. I know good biscuits and I can truly say that Haberdish has some of the best in CLT. They have nailed the art of biscuit making. The same goes for the fried chicken. Their recipe and process are on point and have set the tone for fried chicken in Charlotte.   The downside to my experience was the service. Even at 9:30PM we had to wait 15 minutes to get drinks delivered and longer still to put our food order in. Hopefully the oversight in service isn't a common thing.  Haberdish hits the mark with craft cocktails, biscuits, and their chicken, but could use a little tweaking in the sides and service areas...4/5.",

We orders hush puppies as an appetizer and it was quite delicious they weren't at all grainy and they had this really good sweet tea butter to go with it. I ordered the egg biscuit with a side of grits and cheese. The biscuit was amazing and it was at all dry! The grits were decent I typically don't like stone grits and reason being is because of the texture. Otherwise it was an amazing meal and I'd definitely be back for brunch again!",

We also shared fried chicken, trout, kale grits, kale salad, and tater tots and enjoyed all of it thoroughly. All of that was too much for 3 people, so we brought a good amount home too. Definitely good to note that the small size of the sides is still quite large. The service was fine but could have been a bit more attentive in terms of checking in and refilling waters. Otherwise, this was a really lovely dining experience. Would recommend!",

I came here with my boyfriend and my parents, who were in town to visit. We each picked a few different items and I could never tell you what was the most delicious. Everything was exceptional.  We actually ordered the fried chicken but ended up receiving the baked. The waitress noticed about halfway through our meal and offered to bring the fried, but we (especially me - I don't eat gluten) were so happy with the baked that we didn't care!  Also, side note - I've noticed a few lesser-star reviews that mention the food being heavy and greasy. As I already mentioned, I don't eat gluten or any fried food whatsoever, and I had no problem finding plenty to eat. The menu has a ton of variety.  So good. Truly a gem in this city.",

Four of us started with the pimento cheese ball appetizer (awesome), split a whole fried chicken and three sides, and had some left to take home. The chicken had the right crispy/juicy ratio - cooked perfectly. Sides were tasty, though the mac and cheese was a bit al dente for my taste. Nice selection of local craft beers and full bar service. It's in a great location in Noda, easy walking distance from the light rail station.",

This is a great place to stop for lunch. Their cocktails are not only delicious but instagram worthy! On this visit my server was Deron and he was extremely attentive and knowledgeable of the menu! I ordered the Mac n Cheese and chicken tenders for my meal and some boiled peanuts for the appetizer. We were in and out within a half and hour which was great since I was on a time crunch. However, usually I stay longer and never feel rushed or pressured by the servers. I would definitely recommend to anyone that's looking for some quality fried chicken.",

And the service was even better! We ordered deviled eggs with the smoke trout...you HAVE to get it with the trout! Trust me in this!   For the main entree I ordered ribs with a biscuit. Believe you me that was literally (not the term kids use today to mean not actually literally) the best damn biscuit I've ever had.   My very significant other ordered fried chix and  a waffle. She thoroughly enjoyed both and couldn't get enough of the hot sauce butter. She could have gotten enough because the service was that good there...it's a figure of speech people. Her food actually took a few minutes longer so they actually comped her meal which we weren't expecting at all. All in all banging place and when we go back to Charlotte we'll hit up this place again  P.S. Put their Habenero hot sauce on everything!! I wanted to confiscate it for my own uses but that wouldn't have been kosher",

The menu is fairly simple but each dish is designed to deliver the taste of the South directly to your tastebuds. If you have to have one starter, I'd recommend the pimento cheese ball. Although the cheese straws or pickled items are tops too. The combination of pickled onions and green apples pairs nicely with the spiced pecan rolled pimento cheese ball on the house-made crackers. It's tough not to make a meal from it alone.  The star of the show though is the fried chicken. The skin is crispy and seals in the deliciously moist chicken inside. Paired with a delicious assortment of sides from charred okra with bacon jam to sweet potato dumplings, it's a filling dish.  Stop in. You won't be disappointed you did.",

Our waitress was really nice and very helpful. We placed our food and it did not take long at all. Between the time we arrived and the time we got our check took only 34minutes (yes, I counted it). We were curious about their cinnamon rolls and our waitress said they were pretty good. When they arrive what we thought would be one big cinnamon roll actually were two decent sized rolls that came with some caramel sauce that was simply amazing!  My husband and I both ordered chicken tenders and waffles that came with a Spicy honey butter.  We enjoyed our food very much. The price was fair and the service was good. The vibe of the place it is nice and the decoration has that rustic/hippie vibe that Noda has to offer. We had a great experience and we will return for sure!",

The food was outstanding,interesting, fun.  The decor makes the place inviting and warm.   I devoured the deviled eggs, loved the fried chicken, and enjoyed the sweet potato dumplings, purple cabbage and the glazed carrot.  Loved.  Yum.  Interesting flavors and delicious.    If your visiting Charlotte, this place is worth the trip, difficult parking, crowded street and getting lost twice.  Great adventure.",

    "text": "Be forewarned, there is NO ON-SITE PARKING, so plan on circling around neighborhoods behind it looking for a spot that's not a tow-zone, or using the gravel paid-parking lot a few blocks away. (Our waitress told us some people park at Heist and just walk the 6-8 blocks!)  Once you find parking and get to the restaurant, it's a hip vibe. Very cool bar setup, with patio seating options, both covered and uncovered. The menu is not huge, but the offerings all sounded very unique and they source a lot of stuff locally.   I came here with some friends for a girls night out. Unfortunately, none of the items I got impressed me. We ordered the PB & J Bacon Plate first but then our waitress said they were out of the jelly it came with (on a Tuesday night) and asked us if that was still ok. No thanks, we don't want just a PB Bacon Plate...  So instead we opted for the Smoked Deviled eggs which we had also been looking at. I'll be honest, for $6, I expected more than 4-halves (2. eggs. total.). They're eggs...and I'm sorry to say very bland ones at that. They weren't that smokey and I'm pretty sure I could achieve the same flavor at home if I just cut a hard-boiled egg in half and sprinkled smoked paprika and a few snips of green onions over it. I had thought about just ordering an assortment of \"Snacks\" for my meal, but by this point I thought I'd be safer ordering an entree. They have their standard fare but they also have a rotating Daily menu. I was originally going to order the Cauliflower Steak which a lot of people had said was really good, but our waitress mentioned that the \"Daily\" option of the Wagyu beef corn-dog had been so popular that it had stayed on the menu for several weeks without getting replaced. So I'm sorry to say I ordered that. Sorry because it was so underwhelming. It was literally just a large (1-2\" thick) all-beef corn-dog and a whole-grain Chinese-style mustard for dipping. It was too spicy/horseradishy for my taste, and honestly it completely overpowered the flavor of ANYTHING you dipped in it, so what's the point of that? It wasn't bad....but it wasn't great. It did come with a Cauliflower \"Slaw\" that I did enjoy. That might've actually been the best thing I ate there that night. The fries that came with it were extremely bland. I asked for ketchup and our waitress brought out the tinniest little condiment cup that wasn't even half-full and had barely a tablespoon of ketchup in it. I also ordered a side of their Cast Iron Purple Cabbage...which like the deviled eggs, sounded much better than it tasted. It just was \"flat\" flavor-wise. I don't know how else to say it. There was no pizzazz, no pop. And I was expecting the cabbage to still have a little 'crunch', but it did not; it was the consistency of caramelized onions.   I'm sorry to say the whole meal was a big disappointment for me and given the difficulty to find parking (unless you're lucky enough to live nearby) I don't think it's likely I'll be back.",

Ambience was awesome and loved the covered patio with the huge barn doors! We ordered a lot of different dishes with our favorites being the mac and cheese, the cold special of the day (arugula and bell pepper salad), and the charred okra. The fried chicken and chicken tenders were yummy! Also ordered the cauliflower steak to try and be healthy but it's deep fried so that was a loss  would definitely recommend!",

    "text": "This Gem of a restaurant is located in the former mill town of North Charlotte which is now known as \"NoDa\".   Features:  According to their menu; Notice at the bar the counter top. It is a soap stone bar top that came from a quarry in Virginia. The table tops were hand crafted in town (Charlotte, NC). The bar taps are used spindles from a former mill.   Menu Items Ordered:  Fried Chicken, Homemade Tater Tots, Mac and Cheese and Sweet Tea. All food was delicious. I was full when I left.  Customer Service:  They really took care of me while I was here. I sat at the bar because they were really busy since it was lunch time. Several bartenders and waitresses spoke to me while I was here. They gave me water to start off with. Then I asked for sweet tea. My order was brought to me within a few minutes after ordering.   Other Mentionable Menu Items:  Deviled Eggs, Homemade Dill Pickles, Hushpuppies with sweet tea butter, and Potato Salad with fresh herbs. These menu items I did not try but are popular reading the other Yelp Reviews.   How Discovered:  I found this restaurant while visiting a coffee shop about a block or two away using the Yelp App. The food pictures looked good so I book marked it.   College Students:  Looks like while visiting this area, it  is frequented by college age students. I see there are about 5 colleges or Universities within a 5 mile square radius of this restaurant which is why I see mostly people in their 20's out and about outside and inside this restaurant. There looks to be some apartments and condominiums close by too where they might be staying.  History of Local Area:   This is an old part of Charlotte that has been revitalized. I saw some industrial businesses in the area while on my way here. NoDa is a popular arts and entertainment district of Charlotte, NC. I saw a music venue across from the coffee shop I visited. You can find bands that play there too. I recommend visiting the online website of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.NoDa.org&s=fc8d00bd533c152eedeeeaaa4dd5f62aff299a8b4a85e92f5902cf9b3d76504d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NoDa.org</a> for more information to plan your trip in the area.   Final Thoughts: Yes, I highly recommend visiting Haberdish when you come down here. They also have a bar where they serve drinks such as beer and liquor and even cocktails too. So, you can have lots of fun here which includes dining out, having a cup of coffee, drink a beer and finally see a local band play all within a block or two of this restaurant.",

I ordered the As You Like It and my friend got some sort of hibiscus punch. To be honest, I don't really remember what was in each drink. However, both were tasty and presentation was on point. You have to try the hush puppies. I'm not sure what it is about them but they are absolutely amazing. I would go here just for them. The sweet tea butter that comes with them is the perfect touch. My friend and I also order some fried chicken tenders (2 each) and mac & cheese. The chicken tenders were so crispy and fresh. I paired mine with some wing sauce and ranch. We asked for honey mustard too but the waiter forgot to bring it over, which wasn't a big deal. The mac & cheese was good but I feel like the macaroni could have been cooked a little more. Overall, everything was great and I will definitely continue to visit Haberdish when I am in town!",

I'm not a huge southern fried chicken fan, so I ordered the chicken tenders. Two was plenty when paired with the sides. They had a lot of flavor and went well with all the different dipping sauces.  As we were told, the hush puppies didn't disappoint. I loved the butter they were paired with and ended up asking for more. (We used generous amounts).  I think my favorite thing of all was the chocolate peanut butter old fashioned. It was a nice combination of sweet that cut the bite of bourbon. It was a smooth drink.",

    "text": "Note: this restaurant was extremely busy on Fridays; check-in via app in advance to reduce your wait.  Appetizers - we ordered smoked deviled eggs and hushpuppies; hushpuppies and tea butter was tasty, the smoke on the deviled eggs was too pronounced for my wife but she loves traditional southern deviled eggs.  Entree - the fried chicken is a can't miss; white meat was crispy, not dry and not greasy. The pork shank was tender and delicious; the sauce had a bit of tang that help cut the richness of the dish. The mac and cheese with fried chicken skin bits was good but not outstanding. We both loved the chicken bits but the mac and cheese is average, creamy but not particularly cheesy in taste - a little on the bland side. The corn bread pudding was ok but not great; we felt the bread served no real purpose to the dish.  Dessert - Lemon meringue pie. We love the meringue and the lemon but the crust was hard and added nothing to this dish - so we left the crust.  Restaurant - waitress was very pleasant and accommodating. The restaurant itself is a bit loud so if you are looking for a quiet evening this is not your place.   We would certainly return again.",

Two things- (1) we were told that the small sides were enough to share for 2 people- they were except for the coleslaw which was inexplicably half the size of the other sides and (2) this restaurant really needs to up its Mac n cheese game - it came out dry, cold and tasteless.  Just avoid it. Saw other reviews of it and decided to try anyway. My mistake. That being said it was a nice evening with great chicken!",

There were a handful of tables open, but by 7PM, the place was packed!  I noticed at 7:30 there was a 1-2 hour wait.  Definitely get there early!  The decor was warm and comfortable.  The antique bronze silverware and the serving plates were complemented by mason jar candles & serving spoon holders.  Our table ordered 4 chicken fingers, 2 piece fried chicken, and the roast chicken (1/2) with Alabama white sauce.  Our sides included mac & cheese (large), sweet potato dumplings, tater tots, kale salad, and the special green been casserole.  We had more than enough food for the four of us and our food bill was only about $15 each!!  Everything was delicious, especially the mac & cheese and fried chicken.  Next time I'm back, I'll definitely give the hush puppies and fried cauliflower a try.",

The sodas are more \"natural\" and not \"real\" soft drinks.  The diet coke tasted watered down, with a vanilla after-taste.  We had fried chicken fingers, waffles, and mac & cheese.  The chicken fingers were dry and the crust/batter had no flavor.  The waffles were tough to cut and tough to chew.  The mac & cheese was so-so and just as bland as the rest of the food.  We went at lunch time on a Sunday and they didn't have two items we wanted to order and they also ran out of chicken skins for the mac & cheese.  On top of the food being so bland, the service was horrible!!  Our server kept playing with her hair and her nose ring was disgusting to look at.  She didn't bring our food to the table and she never stopped back by to check on us.  We had to wave her down for drink refills.  We were very disappointed.",

When we travel, we like to sample lots of things. This time we had deviled eggs (delicious), pimento cheese ball (outstanding!), pickles (solid but nothing out of the ordinary), roasted carrot and bacon soup (yummy), smoked chicken (super dry and difficult to eat because it was so tough...however the white sauce is delicious!) and charred okra (different but delicious). I understand that they are better known for the fried chicken, so that could be the problem. Unfortunately, I have a wheat allergy so that wasn't an option for us. Finally, the cocktail menu is unique with fun twists on the usual drinks. I had 'hey honey' and 'summer sin' and would recommend both. Solid place, but stick with the friend chicken!",

The typical wait is 45 mins but on a bad day it's 2hrs believe me we've tried a few times and the wait for a table is crazy.   Now on to the beers. H has a small craft beer selection but they make up for it with their awesome specialty cocktails. Looking for something strong try the Rooted in 28205, it's honestly straight alcohol but a good balance of bourbon and gin. Looking for something a little light but with a kick, try the Gin Smash.  H is known for their chicken so do yourself a favor and try chicken for your first time. The chicken and waffles are great. It comes with a spicy syrup and the waffle has a varying supply of tiny sugar pieces that compliments the syrup.   Looking for an interesting side, try the kale grits won't say anymore .  Overall a great spot to try. The only issue I had was with my server who was a little introverted. Didn't provide his name and no personality but could have been his first day. Maybe a smile or a how are you guys, welcome to H, is this your first time, try the \"insert here\". Just some hints H.",

I ordered the 2 piece white fried chicken and my wife got the ribs...we both ended up with max and cheese as they were out of collards.  The fried chicken was grwat...nice and juicy inside with a very crispy coating.  One negative was that coating was on the inside of the chicken where the tender sits and it was just raw coating sitting there...I scraped it off and did finish all of chicken.  My was very much enjoying her ribs....until she actually bit through the bone of the rib and since she didn't notice at first...she was chewing bone.  Needless to say it put her off and she did not finish.  I did offer her my chicken and she had a bite....but the experience threw her a bit.  We were not gonna say anything but the waiter could tell something was up and she showed h jim the bone with a bite mark out of it.  He did take them off the bill for us and was extremely apologetic.  The Mac and Cheese was good as well...the pasta was a bit toothy but the cheese sauce was tasty.  I am sure we will return as the chicken was quite tasty",

The Mac-n-cheese was creamy with large elbow noodles leaving my mouth wanting more and more. By far my favorite was the banana pudding, thick and creamy and quite rich. Definitely a dessert to share with others. Amazing ambiance that had plenty of space for children. Has both indoor and outdoor seating and a large bar. A trendy restaurant and was glad we went between 3 and 4 pm on a Saturday . We heard sometimes the wait time to be seated can be an hour or two but since we came before the Saturday night dinner rush we had no wait and were immediately seated. Waitress and staff were friendly, attentive and quick in service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return.",

WOW WHAT? We were told by our waitress it was served during the week so now we have to shift our focus to lunch unless we wanted chicken and waffles, the only breakfast on the menu. Well we we're next to a Large party of people who received all of our waitresses attention! We were told that at about 1145 AM they were out of Tater Tots, then after making other selections we finished our orders and proceeded to wait about 20 to 30 mins then our food came surprisingly my food was Good, i had the smoked chicken with macaroni & cheese, and kale grits instead of the Tots. The grits was just ok needed salt and pepper which we didn't have on the table, we had to ask the host and hostess for extras we needed which they helped out! But my wife's chicken and waffles were cold not even warm enough to melt the butter and the sugar sprinkled on the top was too hard to eat. So unfortunately our impression didn't live up to the Hype!",

It was very tasty had many bold flavors almost masked the liver, but that was OK with me. +Sweet potato dumplings - was nervous about the mixed review on these, but I loved them  the most. They ARE savory, but that's what I want a dumpling to be..with a hint of sweet potato essence. +Pimento cheese ball - yummy starter, made refreshing with apple slices +Trout - perfectly cooked, but a tad bit salty for my taste +Banana Pudding - tasty, but not incredibly memorable +Sonker - cooked to order and it came out HOT, interactive - pour your milk over it...very unique and would recommend",

The deviled eggs and sweet potato dumplings were both bland. The best part of the meal was the cocktail (pim's cup $11) and Mac & cheese with spicy chicken skins. Hostess wasn't inviting and it was difficult to tell she worked there by her outfit and demeanor (looked like a customer waiting for someone). It seems overpriced for what you get.",

And, the fried chicken, waffle and trout were all delicious. Most importantly, best biscuit of the trip! Atmosphere is casual and fun, staff is helpful.",

I would be happy to go there over and over if it were a coffee shop or someplace really cool to hang out with friends and enjoy yourself.  The people were nice and attentive. The server was quick and polite and happy.  The food was not as good as either the building or the staff. Very pretentious for chicken parts and mac and cheese doused in bbq sauce and fried chicken skin.  And if it were possible (which it was that day) the people are even more pretentious than the food. Starting with the 3 guys sitting next to us eating chicken waffles and sipping champagne at 2 o'clock on a Monday. (Not to mention the not 1, not 2, but 3 sets of glasses in the shirt pocket of the guy facing me).  We won't be back but I'm sure people will continue to pour into Haberdish and be very satisfied.  We weren't.",

    "text": "Came here a couple weeks ago for the first time, on a Thursday! It was busy & poppin' - they do not do reservations! But they do the app 'no wait' so you can get in line before you go. I recommend that every day of the week there! Our wait time was like 45-1 hour and we arrived at 8pm. By the time 8:40 rolled around a spot opened at the bar so we ordered cocktails, and then ended up just ordering dinner there too bc we were done waiting & hungry. Besides the bar wasn't a bad spot.   They have a lot of special cocktails that they apparently change out every so often. They are pricey. Like average $12 I'd say. I had the love potion ($11) only bc I was on the mend from being sick and didn't think I could handle anything too crazy. By reading the description I didn't think it would be too lemon-y. But it was, just a heads up!   I love that you can literally order ONE chicken tender. lol. Good sized though, with house made sauces. I had their honey mustard (Idk what they called it for sure). I also tried one of their sides, a kale salad. Was really good. I felt healthy and good about it, you know after pairing it with my chicken tender. Or maybe I had two, I don't remember.   The inside was cool, my kinda place. But I'm weird. Go give this place a try. The reason I'm not giving a 5 star rating is because: no drinks specials - ever, drinks are pricey, and no reservations.",

    "text": "Five stars for a strong start! I rarely visit restaurants in the first month or two of opening, but my dinner on Saturday, January 7 made me want to return again and again, both with locals and friends from out of town.   We were able to score three seats at the bar about 20 minutes before they closed the kitchen, so we quickly ordered a cornucopia of southern staples: biscuits and bacon jam, fried chicken, brined smoked chicken with smooth Alabama white sauce, sweet potato dumplings, mac and cheese, tater tots and charred okra. All of these things were delicious and came out on separate plates that made it perfect for sharing.   That being said, the hushpuppies took the prize for best snack; the fried cornmeal dough and sweet tea butter were amazing. They had the right balance of not-too-crunchy exterior and pillow-soft inside...I would say the hushpuppies had more in common with a donut hole than your standard southern kitchen fare.   I'll echo Nikki W's comments that it is good to be prepare with limited parking. My dining companions were impressed with their cocktails and our service was great, especially considering that weekend's dusting of snow that psyched everyone out with expectations for real accumulation.   We took a piece of the fried chicken home, along with a biscuit and okra with bacon jam, and all were delicious the second time around. I wish we had saved room for dessert, as the selection looked amazing. Next time I'm trying the savor corn bread pudding and fried chicken tenders. Cloth napkins, a real bar and a nice price make Haberdish a can't miss addition to NoDa!",

I just got the fried chicken thighs and I thought it was the best fried chicken I've ever had (way better than Price's Chicken Coop). I also sampled hush puppies, mac and cheese, the cinnamon roll, and the waffle. The hush puppies with the sweet tea butter were also the best I've ever had. The mac and cheese was just ok. The cinnamon roll was pretty good, but it's was more of a dry crumbly biscuit and I prefer doughy. The caramel sauce served with it was incredibly good though. The waffle was also very good.   The decor of the restaurant is really well done. It's probably one of my favorite in Charlotte.   This is definitely the place to come if you're looking for some amazing fried chicken and all around good Southern food!",

We waited for half an hour and no one even gave us water.  I came back with my boyfriend a few weeks ago, and a completely different experience. We were craving southern food, and decided to give this place a chance.  And I'm so glad I came back! As you can see by the photos, we went ALL OUT. We did not hold back. I'm not sure if our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, but either way, our stomachs left happy.  I had heard good things about their fried chicken, so that's one of the dishes we picked. But my favorite? The mac and cheese! Super creamy and loved the fried skin on the top! All the dishes were amazing, but I'm sure he rest of the items on the menu were good too.  Only giving this place 4 out of 5 starts because I'm still bitter about how my friends and I were initially treated. Maybe if I got a free meal then would I give them that final star ;)",

I got the fried chicken & waffle. The chicken was huge, and the skin was seasoned, but the meat was not. Also, I was not a fan of the sauce/syrup for the waffle.  Overall, I think that this place may be a bit over-hyped. This is certainly a type of \"southern\" that i'm not used to.",

    "text": "We went here last month on a whim when visiting Charlotte, and I'm so happy we stopped by! Since moving across the country, I've definitely missed NoDa, and I've only heard good things about this place, so I had to try.   I ordered the hush puppies (a southern staple I've missed!), the sweet potato dumplings, and the kale and grits. I love a good hush puppy, and they did not disappoint. Firm on the outside, nice and fluffy and warm on the inside - what's not to like?? I had bigger hopes for the sweet potato dumplings, however. They were tasty, but it's like when you're expecting one taste, and you take a bite, and it ends being nothing like what you want? My sweet tooth wanted these to be sweet, but they were more savory, which isn't a bad thing. Just not what I wanted at the time.   I really, really like the kale and grits. I don't typically do dairy, and I was assured that there was no cream in the grits. They were so good! The grits were cooked perfectly (no grittiness or mushiness), and the seasoning was on point. Our server also made sure to recommend a tasty virgin mixed drink (I can't remember what it was now), but sipping it made me feel like it was the real thing. Those are the sort of things you look forward to when you can't drink for a while.   I would definitely recommend them, and if you're a meat eater, I'm sure it will be even better. My fiance had the chicken and waffles and said they were some of the best he'd had!",

    "text": "Lots of hype here for Haberdish, which wasn't a huge surprise because it's in Noda and everyone Plaza and Noda adds a .5-1 stars because these are 'cool/hip' spots. We went here for dinner on a Saturday and used the NoWait app....Good news we were 78th in line! (With this kind of wait, this place must be giving away free biscuits) A mere 3.5 hrs later we made it to a table.  Unfortunately no free biscuits...but we soldiered on.  The place was jam packed but had a pretty cool look and feel.  I would probably enjoy the bar area on a lower key night and grab some apps and drinks.    We ordered some apps and eventually some friend chicken.  The food was fine/good.  The theme with this place is 'fried'.  Everything is heavy and you will feel it.  (Side note: In general people rave about fried chicken, but no matter how 'great' it is, it still a max 5/10 good in terms of food).  As long as you are good with fried and heavy food, then you will be a fan of Haberdish.",

Until I got an invite to sup and dug a little deeper. 331 reviews with a 4.5 star average with most of the complaints being a policy of not taking reservations. I can totally understand from a management perspective of not wanting to deal with the headaches of taking reservations! It probably makes life so much easier!  We used the App and waited only about 15 minute before being seated on the covered patio. Love the detail oriented design/decor that focuses on conservation and recycling. The outdoor section was surprisingly toasty and festive for December.  The Yelpers I roll with like to go whole hog - and boy did we - we ordered about every side they had some chicken tenders and starters. The Smoked deviled eggs and hushpuppies were excellent (perhaps egg-cellent) and love the addition of Sweet Tea Butter with the pups. Soooo  after eating massive quantities of Tater Tots (house made), corn bread pudding, charred okra, glazed carrots, mac and cheese with crispy chicken skins, kale grits, pickled coleslaw and sweet potato dumplings, there were some definite stand outs but no losers. For me the sun beamed down on the Kale Grits, Glazed Carrots and Okra - all of these had a special twist that really made them shine.  The servers are really on top of things here - love the cocktails and beer selections and the kitschy mismatched dishes. All the food/dishes were presented timely and hot - what a beautiful and delicious spread!  \"And then I ate their grits and now I'm a believer!\"",

We were told that the noodles were al dente, but I'm not sure that's the case - it should have some give but these were almost like they were barely cooked. Even when the second macaroni came out it was still just a tad bit over warm. I do want to give the restaurant a second chance though.",

I understand that it's the day after a holiday and the kitchen is slammed but we sat for 30 minutes after we ordered our food with no water.  I ordered the potato bowl and asked if I could have the poached egg scrambled instead.  The waiter said he would check to see if it's possible because of how slammed the kitchen was.  I mentioned i can order something different if not.  He never checked and the meal came out 30 mins later with a  poached egg.  I asked for if I could have a plate to take the poached egg out of my bowl and the waiter never apologized or attempted to make any changes.  Unfortunately I will not be recommending any longer until some changes are made.",

    "text": "I live close to Haberdish and was wanting to go more and more as I saw fellow Yelpers pictures they posted and reviews that were coming out. Its fairly new so staff is just now getting to wine training, etc., from what I heard. The owner of Growler's Pourhouse and Crepe Cellar opened Haberdish.  I am not a big beer fan and think there is a void in Charlotte for great cocktails. Its getting better though and Haberdish is helping me out there. They take on the classics and have their menu sectioned off in three sections from a low alcohol to high proof. I selected a lemon cocktail but did not jot the name down and they don't currently have a cocktail menu handy on-line. It was tip-top though! My friend and husband got their version of a Manhattan. Haberdish even makes their own tonic so make sure to get a Doc Portor and tonic while there. Their specialty is the fried chicken which you can get a few ways and can even get tenders instead of on the bone. Their sides are things like cornbread spoon bread, which makes for a killer breakfast with an egg the next day and they also offer homemade tater tots, charred okra and the list goes on. We did take out and the veg of the day was broccolini which came with crumbled bacon and a hot sauce hollandaise. We added some of that left over hollandaise to our egg the next day! Big score there.  I totally appreciated that the bartender who took our to-go order relayed a message from the Chef who wanted to let us know the sauce might break and may not look as pretty once we got home. It didn't though and was great. We tried to get the lemon meringue pie to go but they did not think that would work well as a to-go desert and recommended other choices. I like that because I know how particular I am with how my food looks and tastes when I cook.  We got taken care of really well, we had our questions answered and the staff was efficient and friendly.  I have one gripe; I don't think this bar/restaurant should have a TV in it. It totally kills the vibe and is unnecessary in my opinion.  During the spring, Ill come for the sliding barn doors that open up to let fresh air in!",

    "text": "I've been following Haberdish on Instagram since their construction days and finally got a chance to try them for dinner last week. I had really high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. We arrived early (around 5:15pm on a Tuesday) and were seated right away but the place quickly filled up and there were people waiting for a table by 5:45.   Everything on the menu was so appealing that it was difficult to choose what to order. We ended up over-ordering (as usual) and left feeling uncomfortably full but very happy. Here is a rundown of what we ordered:  Hushpuppies: Sneaky star of the show! Hushpuppies are pretty much always a safe bet, but these were extra crisp on the outside while staying soft in the middle. The sweet tea butter was a wonderful accompaniment and now I need it with all hushpuppies in the future.  Biscuits and Bacon Jam: wow are these GIANT biscuits! You get two with your order and they are covered in a salty-sweet bacon jam. I'm not a huge bacon jam fan, but I definitely liked these better than the ones at The Asbury.  Chicken Tender: I knew I was going to be full after all the appetizers and sides, so I only ordered 1 chicken tender just so I could try their fried chicken. The breading was thick and crsipy, well-done without being burnt, and the chicken inside was juicy and tender. Overall exceeded expectations.  Chicken and Biscuits: **Only available on Tuesdays** My friend ordered this and devoured it before I could try it, but seemed to really enjoy it. Lots of gravy and white meat chicken, some veggies, and more(!) giant biscuits.  Mac and Cheese: Creamy, cheesy, and homemade. A little salty for my taste but I would definitely order it again  Sweet Potato Dumplings: I was most excited about these, but they were really salty and a bit forgettable.   Tater Tots: Definitely homemade and, I never thought I would say this, definitely better than the frozen OreIda ones that I grew up on.  Overall I can't wait to go back. If I had one complaint it would be that the dishes were a bit salty, but I am kind of sensitive to salt so it may just be a personal preference. Haberdish is a really versatile space- great for a date, girls night out, brunch, or just some small plates and cocktails at the bar.",

Once we checked in, we sat at the bar for about 10 minutes, and our table was ready.  Our server was very informative, friendly, and patient. Drinks: We shared the Kentucky Hello Bourbon Punch and it was incredible. Almost too pretty to drink, and tasted even better.  Apps: We ordered the smoked deviled eggs - so so so good. As long as you are a fan of the smoked flavor, you will love these. Sweet potato dumplings - We were extremely disappointed after reading so many raving reviews about these. The dumplings were very bland. We were expecting an intense sweet potato flavor, and there was very little sweet potato taste, if any at all. To us, the dumplings tasted like dough topped with butter, salt, and pepper. Maybe my palette isn't advanced enough for these, but I just do not understand the hype. Main: Chicken tenders with honey mustard - oh my gosh. Delicious!! The chicken is so tender and moist (sorry for all who hate that word) and the skin is so crispy. The honey mustard has a little wasabi kick to it - pairs perfectly! Side: Mac n cheese - thick and creamy, just the way we like it. However, it came out lukewarm. That didn't stop us from devouring it, though! We will absolutely return to Haberdish but instead of the dumplings order the hushpuppies or biscuits. :)",

    "text": "My nine month pregnant wife and I ate here for the first time Friday night for our 5th year anniversary. Haberdish came recommended to us by some close friends who had glowing reviews. I'm a restaurant co-owner in Ballantyne, and I've set my standards pretty high for quality food and service. That said, Haberdish is the best meal we've had since we moved to Charlotte in January. The portions were huge, the prices were fair, the food was absolutely excellent (the ribs, fried chicken with Alabama white sauce, bbq carrots, and banana pudding were out of this world), and our server- Keer (sp?)- was such a pleasure. He was Conversational and light hearted but never lingered around too long, knowledgeable about the food with great recommendations, always came by with refills before we needed them, and even put our banana pudding on the house for our anniversary. We will absolutely be back and tell everyone we know about it. Well done Haberdish team!",

    "text": "In one word, Haberdish opening in Noda is exciting! Major props for converting an eyesore building into a super vibrant space with a cozy interior perfect for a cold, almost winter night. I'm sure that it will be equally hopping in warmer weather. Really, from start to finish, the space seemed to be transformed in record time. We were greeted immediately, as the hostess is basically posted at the door. They probably need to get some kind of small hostess stand. Anyway, the place was pretty packed and we were given options on tables and we chose the long community table just off to the right of the entrance. I think that they've been open for about a week, but the menu provided a lot of options for all kinds of diners and drinkers. We were 4 people, including the wife and another couple, so we just decided on a bunch of small plates and sides to share with our chosen entrees. But first let's talk about the drinks. There was a lot of variety on their cocktail menu to go along with beer and wine options. When one of us asked our server about their gin options, she had one of the bartenders come over and talked about the options. I really liked that added touch, whether it's a regular protocol, or maybe the server wasn't comfortable discussing the gin options. Either way, the drinks were good and I'm pretty sure that they can make you any drink that you want based on the many bottles on the shelves behind the bar.  For food, we ordered entrees of trout, half chicken, and pork shank. As sides, we shared the daily special pickled veggies, in this case beets and onions, the daily special roasted carrots, okra and the cornbread pudding. Now we ordered a large portion of cornbread pudding, but only got a small one but also got a small plate of sweet potato dumplings. We figured more variety, so we didn't make a fuss. Ultimately, we all wound up being stuffed, so again, we didn't make a fuss, but we all agreed that the sweet potato dumplings were our least favorite. For me they fell flat and were very doughy. All the other veggies were great, especially the carrots and pickled beets/onions. The okra was good too, but I'm not a super fan. As for the cornbread pudding, it was rich and delicious, and I usually don't like cornbread. The entrees were all presented well, and again we were all in agreement that the trout and chicken were the leaders of the pack with the pork shank trailing behind. Let's just say that the shank could have been more moist in some areas. The trout was cooked to perfection and while the fried chicken wasn't earth shattering, it was well cooked and moist with just the right amount of batter. Plenty of food for the price and we were stuffed, so no dessert for us on this night. Once again the group was in agreement on some return visits to have more of our favorites and we all look forward to see how the menu evolves. I know that I for one am looking for an ever changing seasonal menu going forward. On this go around the space and atmosphere out shined the food a bit but there is clear potential for the future.",

My wife had the chicken fingers and mac & cheese, and I had the pork shank. Please read the whole review to understand why I only gave it 3 stars. I will start with my 5 stars first.  Atmosphere 5 stars Service 5 stars Beer and Wine selection 5 stars Taste of food 5 stars Appetizer & side selections 5 stars Entree selections 2 Stars Smaller entree selection 0 stars Price 3 Stars  Bang for your buck 3 Stars (Unless it's the chicken fingers, then it's 5 stars)  Constructive criticism:   Install a coat hook for customers jackets.  If you serve chicken fingers, offer blue cheese and hot sauce as an option and serve aside large enough to dip your fingers in.   Offer more entree options then fried chicken, trout, and pork.   I understand they are new, and still figuring things out. This place has the ability to be five stars all the way around. I will say they've hired an excellent staff and I was very impressed with the service as well as the quality of the food. I just wish I didn't leave still hungry.",

It's like a fancier, more delicious version of bojangles with more options on the menu. I mean that as the highest compliment. Please try this place out in NoDa because they are amazing! I would recommend going earlier in the evening or trying to get in on a waiting app because the wait can be pretty long on the weekends. I can't wait to try their brunch!",

The service is great, interior design is super cool, you can tell that everything is very well thought out and there was a lot of love and effort put into it.  For the appetizers we ordered biscuits with bacon jam, which were amazing. Entrees were chicken and waffles. Not only they were delicious, and served with housemade habanero hot sauce, it was also a lot of food, for a very reasonable price. Also ordered banana pudding for dessert, very good too.  14$ cocktails are a bit much, in my opinion, but I don't drink, so it doesn't affect my impression of the restaurant.    Definitely coming back to try more food.  UPD: came back here for Mother's Day. The food was just as delicious and service was fast and friendly. This is definitely becoming one of my favorite Sunday brunch spots in Charlotte.",

    "text": "We have been to Haberdish twice now and have yet to have something we didn't love. I would recommend this restaurant along with Davidson Street Public House as the two mush try places in NoDa.   The old brick building housing the restaurant was abandoned a year and a half ago when I first came to Charlotte. They have done an amazing job turning something that looked like a tear down into a building with character and great ambiance. I'm excited to dine in the outdoor patio when the weather gets better. They have large barn doors in the inside space that open up to connect the two areas.   Of course you have to get the fried chicken. The 2 piece dark meat, a thigh and leg, is only $6 and the two piece white is $8. Not a bad deal for the quality they offer. It's hands down the best fried chicken I've had in the city and maybe anywhere. I love the extra crispy crust, seasoned to perfection and the tender moist meat inside. Fried chicken doesn't seem like it would be hard to do right, but it really is. They've figured out how to make it just the way I like it.   So far we've a handful of sides - the sweet potato dumplings, mac and cheese, hush puppies, house pickles, and the cornbread bread pudding. They have all been excellent, particularly the hush puppies and dumplings.   The full bar has a decent selection of beers and a great variety of cocktails.   Luckily I live right down the street so I can now frequent this place as much as I want. The food is decadent so I'll probably keep it to once a month at best.",

I had the chicken and waffles with the honey maple some kind of syrup that was a little spicy but definitely not good. For the chicken and waffles I should have stuck with the traditional syrup. Chicken tenderloins were tasty but the breading again just wasn't that good.  For dessert we split a space banana pudding which was good but it was more like a banana pudding mousse I'm a traditionalist when it comes to banana pudding.  After all of the hype I was expecting it to be much better. I doubt we'll return here.",

The mint julep was amazing but the best food was the fried chicken (perfect amount of crisp), their special hot sauce, and the mac and cheese. They have small plates for sides and larger plates so our group got the larger plates and decided to share everything.   Parking in NODA is a pain so we decided to uber which made our experience very pleasant since we already had a reservation via the app.",

Rather than maple syrup they serve a honey based sauce that has both sweet and savory elements (did I taste a hint of Worcestershire sauce in the housemade creation?)  Service was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was casual, rustic and urban all at the same time. A lot of attention to detail with the decor made it all come together using a lot of reclaimed materials.   We will definitely return!",

The setting is more of a rustic vibe with Mason jars, wooden floors and long bar. Start off the night with one of their signature drinks. A favorite of mine is the Amber Glass, super tasty. The menu is more of a Southern style with a twist. Fried chicken is delicious, and the trout is to die for! Also, keep an eye out for the daily specials. It's a great chance to try something new and yummy. Overall, Haberdish is just fun. Nestled in the middle of NoDa, you can enjoy a great meal and explore the neighborhood after. Must go!",

Portions were generous, flavors were amazing & the prices were modest.  Pros: Food, prices, drinks Cons: They are only in Charlotte!

From reading other Yelp reviews, the menu looks pretty fantastic but I didn't indulge. If you are coming for dinner on a weekend, be ready to wait. The restaurant was pretty much packed the entire time we were there.   The drinks delivered. They have an interesting menu consisting of craft cocktails which is what I stuck with. If you're looking for something lighter, they also have beer and wine. If you're just trying to get your drink on, they have a long bar as well as a patio in the front of the restaurant. Service was great too!",

The best, however, were the Hushpuppies, NC Trout, Corn Bread Pudding, and the Blueberry Ice Cream.  All of the chicken dishes were very tasty and I would order any of them again (I am usually a Pescatarian by the way; the chicken was that good!).  We were torn on the Tater Tots and Mac n' Cheese, both of which were very tasty but not \"special\".  The Hushpuppies and Smoked Chicken were truly outstanding and worth coming back for (we live in Los Angeles, by the way!).  To top it all off, our Server (who could easily pass for Zoey Deschanel's Twin Sister!) was really attentive, friendly, and made us feel welcome.   In short, if you are ever in or near Charlotte, NC, get yourself over to NoDa (North Davidson, an old Mill Town converted to a hip and modern arts and culture district), you simply MUST go to Haberdish!",

Usually how it works is you order multiple side dishes and share them all, then order a main chicken dish if you like. Very nice people and service in the prime location of NoDa. Most definitely will return! Definitely try the Okra and Mac N Cheese, but for sure try the hush puppies with the sweet pecan butter. Pure bliss!!",

Dinner was great and atmosphere was pretty cool too. Only complaint, it was extremely loud, hard to have a conversation with anyone at the table that wasn't sitting next to you.

Smoked deviled eggs - more please!  Subtle but statement making smoke flavors surrounded the egg whites, filled with velvety smooth yolk deliciousness.  Washed it down with a cocktail called Besame! Items I didn't have but Hubby had were: the fried chicken which he said is quite possible the best he's had. He also ordered the Mac n cheese with the crispy chicken skin and enjoyed it plenty.  But his favorite item of the night goes to (drumroll) the hush puppies with sweet tea butter. He washed his meal down with a mint julep which I did taste and it was delish.  That charred okra will haunt my dreams until we meet again. Until then....",

We arrived for dinner around 9:45PM, and the hostess, server and bartender were still happy to see us (or at least they fooled us!). Our jet-lagged-selves needed more than a few minutes deciding on beers and food, and our server was patient, friendly, and genuine. We asked for some menu suggestions of dishes to share, and landed on: Biscuits with bacon jam, which were piled high with a bacon jam that did not, thankfully, complete saturate the biscuits. The macaroni and cheese was cheesy but not overly rich, but we fought over finishing the kale salad and pumpkin-mushroom lettuce wraps! By the time we finished our meal, we were pretty much the last table- but were not hustled out, nor did the server drop our check like a hint! I would absolute go back and try more of the menu, including the cauliflower steak! As a vegetarian who dabbles in the occasional sampling of bacon, I was worried the South wouldn't offer too many vegetarian options, but was proved wrong, starting with this meal!",

Food: Walking in, I automatically knew the food would be good because it smelled AWESOME. I had the cauliflower steak and a side of tater tots. I also tried the Mac & Cheese. The cauliflower steak was good, the breading was awesome and the sauce on top as well. I think my favorite thing I tried: the tots. They're made in house from scratch. Major cool points for accommodating food options for all types of eaters whether you're a pescatarian, vegetarian, etc. The wait for the food was less than 20 mins. It was also a big portion. The food was absolutely the highlight of this place. Try the tots lol, you won't regret it.   Drinks: I tried a mimosa and an apothecary drink, the latter being infused with CBD. (So likely to bring a very relaxed feeling). Both very well made. More cool points: they squeeze fresh orange juice for all their drinks that have orange juice, right in front of you at the bar.   Service: The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and checked on us. No complaints there.   Restaurant hacks/Key Info:   1. If you're planning on dining here,  check for a wait on Yelp. You can even add yourself to the wait list. You can also order to go. This place can get pretty full so always check in and see if there is a wait.   2. Parking is pretty annoying/bad in this neighborhood. Prepare for that. Might need to drive around a bit.   3. If you are looking for BRUNCH, they only serve brunch on weekdays. Weekends they'll be serving the dinner menu in the afternoons.   Overall, I'd absolutely return. This place is great for outings with friends, significant others and even casual dates. The drinks are all really good as well as the food.",

    "text": "Finally made it here!!! I wasn't pleased with how they gave away my table that I called to  be put on the waitlist. See when I first called to inquire about reservations I was told to go on Yelp and join the waitlist. Problem was they only let you do 6 people and I had a party of 11 so it said to call the host. I called at 12:30 and placed my name for 2pm(Sunday). At 12:50 I receive a text stating that my table was ready and would be forfeited in ten minutes. What??? I know I told the Woman 2pm. Fast forward, we couldn't get down the street because the streets were blocked off due to a street festival. So I called them to ask them how to get around the closures and to let them know I was in the area. Welp I was told that my table had been given up because I didn't come within the ten minutes of the text message. I explained to the lady that I spoke with another woman earlier and I was to be there at 2. Well of course the lady said that she didn't know who I spoke with because they don't \"reserve\" tables. Ok so why did I have to call the \"host\" to tell her about my over 6 people?  Anywho, put name on waitlist again and waited about 45 minutes for a table. Ok now it gets better!!  The food was good especially the fried chicken. The Mac and cheese was different but tasty, as well as the coleslaw. I didn't like the deviled eggs, they were very bland. Their banana pudding is delicious to me. But our Server Margo was amazing and handled our party of 11 with such ease and grace. She recommended the pineapple infused spiced rum punch!!!! And I thank her to this very moment. It was refreshing and had a hint of jalapeno when you swallowed. AMAZING!!!! We ended up getting the large which came in a decorative bowl and a personal server(for the first round). The large was pricey but it was well worth it because three of us had 4 glasses each, and I believe the glasses were about 4-5 ounces. To me, the menu is very limited but straight to the point. But I'll definitely be back to sit at the bar for that amazing drink!!!",

They serve their dishes family style so if you'd like to try their menu go with a large group!   Drink menu is gorgeous and the drinks itself are mouth watering. I got the coffee.....SO GOOD.   Man and I ordered our chicken (me dark with a waffle, him white) and shared a side of Mac and cheese. Chicken was delicious- the breading was thicker. Mac and cheese was also yummy but I would opt for another one of their sides next time. The waffle was the most surprising part of my meal- while it looked small it was dense and very filling. It almost reminded me of a soft pretzel- so good! Their syrup is super delicious and not too sweet. Perfect bite consisted of chicken, waffle and syrup...YUM!   We will be back!",

This place delivers on every count. You can't go wrong with the fried chicken which is everything that its billed to be. You get many choices of sides and I would suggest the okra, cornbread and hush puppies.  This place is very popular and they don't take reservations. They do have a cool feature that allows you to track your time progress to being seated once you give them your cell number and allow use to the Yelp app. Our group of 6 found it to be very accurate.  They serve next level cocktails which are very popular. Not all because they include some creative and exotic names and mixes but because they are crafted and poured by True professionals. The bar staff are all licenses and trained and have continuing and on-going training.   If you pay any credence to Southern Living Magazine, it's rated the No 5 top restaurant in the South, ahead of Commanders Palace in New Orleans and the bar came in rated as number 2.",

We easily got seats and had to wait a little for our server- which was understandable considering how busy the place was. She was really nice and got our drink orders. I love the cocktail list here and the brunch specials as well. I got the Bellini and it was perfect with the right amount of alcohol in it. Next we ordered hush puppies, Mac n cheese with the chicken crumbles, collard greens, tater tots, fried chicken and ribs. The hush puppies were the BEST hush puppies I've ever had and the butter it came with paired well with the deep fried balls. The Mac n cheese was very al dente but I like it that way. I wouldn't get the chicken skin crumble on top though- just felt like a lot of extra oil. The collards were good and so were the tater tots, chicken and ribs. The only thing I didn't like was how oily and greasy everything was. I get that southern food is supposed to be deep fried but it doesn't hurt to drain off some of it afterwards. Next time I come, I'll definitely try more of the cocktails and just do a small side dish or two.",

Order these, trust me.  Dill House Pickles-dill because, what other type of pickle is there? Yummy.  Fried Chicken-came out hot and delicious. Seasoned perfectly. Also they make all of their sauces in house and are super flavorful, try their habanero sauce for some heat and vinegary addition that compliments fried chicken so well.  Charred Okra-cooked to perfection with balanced seasoning which highlights the natural flavors of the okra.  BBQ Glazed Carrots-they offer a nice touch of seeetness and were also cooked to perfection. Very yummy.  All in all, this place was an all around win.",

I got a couple brined chicken tenders as an appetizer . . Best fried chicken I've had in years.  I bet their chicken and waffles is to die for. . .  Dinner I got the lamb . .and it was a solid choice.  I even splurged for dessert ( a nice banana pudding) that just sealed the deal.

    "text": "Haberdish and haberdash and haberdish and uh-  Look, this place may be hipster as all hell with a bike messenger aesthetic and a Park Slope menu but hot damn if they don't nail it. NAIL IT!  Smoked trout deviled eggs nestled in a bed of their buddies' whipped innards had that paprika kick and the lakeside bold and oily taste of a line-caught fish straight outta A River Runs Through It. Bang up starter, as were the light and spongey (?) hush puppies.  Because I'm an idiot and maybe I wanted to slip in to a food coma, I went full bird on the fried chicken thigh biscuit sandwich. The dark meat? Huge, boneless, endless brined and packed with flavor under an excellent fry. The biscuit? The baked good equivalent of the Burj Khalifa. Calling this mound of food affixed to the plate with honey a \"sandwich\" is like referring to the Colossus of Rhodes as a \"nice statue.\" But it's not only the size that mattered - it had a divine crumbly without being dry. Nitpicking a bit, but the slaw was too oniony for me. Would have loved something a little more dill or poppy forward.  Oh, and the bonus dish! Decadent af mac and cheese pummeled - PUMMELED! - with spicy crispy chicken skin. After a moment of textural complement, the entire bite melts in your mouth.  It was at this time I realized I basically ate every aspect of a chicken, and I'm okay with that. Coffee is Counter Culture (I believe?) served in a Stanley Thermos (I know for certain). Clever.  Housemade hot sauce featured carrots and habanero. That factoid is for Nikki and Isaiah. Get a blonde bloody mary for a smoother, sweeter tomato and a guaranteed triple-digit like count on your Insta.  I wanna go back right now, but I just finished my last brunch five days and I'm still full, so whatever. You can have my seat.",

    "text": "Fancy southern food that gets the job done, without going overboard in it's modern trendiness. I was told this was a great place to get chicken and waffles. I decided to visit before I left for the airport, considering I would probably go into a food coma afterwards. I like the fact that you can order pretty much any type of chicken with your waffle. I was tempted to get chicken tenders, but I figured I should try the actual boned fried chicken. I went with dark meat, because not only does it have more flavor, but it isn't as big as a breast. I liked the spices on the breading. I can taste the sage in their mix, and it was quite pleasant. They had a great crispy batter, as it broke apart in chunks, dissolving into oily goodness. The meat itself was tender and moist. Not a single bite was dry or stringy. I also liked the grease factor was under control; the grease still had character, but never felt overwhelming on my hands or my mouth. Although I love my waffles crispy, I was actually OK with it being softer. They make their waffles dense, almost like a super thick pancake. In the center, there was a firm doughiness that I actually enjoyed. In a way, it felt like a hybrid of a pancake and biscuit, with it leaning more towards a pancake consistency. They offer maple syrup and honey butter on the side. I recommend you get both, but especially the honey butter. It was absolutely divine. I insured I dipped or poured my food with that honey butter every time. It was simple yet effective. I got tater tats for my side. I liked that I could get a half order size. Even though they actually made them extra crispy upon my request, I felt it wasn't to my usual standard of amazing tater tot texture that I forever crave. Taste wise an inner texture wise, it reminded me of a high-quality hash brown. I thought it went well with my chicken and waffles. All I was really missing was a Friday egg to make it a country breakfast hash. I would've tried the barbecue glazed carrots, but I already knew I wouldn't be able to finish it if I ordered it.   I like that this place stays focused on serving homestyle southern food, but still having a few twists and elegance thrown in the mix. Granted, this is my first time in Charlotte, but I thought this place was a great recommendation for having chicken and waffles (especially during dinner time). If you have a chance to come here, try to bring your family, as this is what the menu portions are geared towards. You can still eat solo, but make sure you bring your appetite.",

The interior and aesthetic was really open and gave you a really relaxed but upscale vibe.   We started off with a full Thermos of coffee and a round of Blonde Bloody Marys which are a lot easier to drink than your average Bloody in my opinion. They went down so smooth and come out a beautiful orange color I've not seen before. Next we tried the deviled eggs, hush puppies and biscuits. Everything was sooooo good and my mouth is watering thinking about it right now so I'm going to move on.   I went with an order of the Egg, Cheese and Bacon Biscuit and we all split a side of the Macaroni and Cheese with chicken skin topping. Just think about what I just typed right there.

Having come here on a Sunday for brunch I was little disappointed to find out that they don't have any typical brunch items here. Their entree selection was a little skimpy. The only thing that seemed the most \"brunchy\" was the chicken and waffles, which I have to say was really good. The syrup that came with it was a honey butter and it was delicious! The kale grits was also really good and creamy. However, I would not recommend the sweet potato dumplings. It sounds good, but it does not taste sweet like a sweet potato and it was very greasy. It had no flavor. I debated on whether or not to give this place 3 or 4 stars. I was disappointed that they did not have brunch and there we a couple of items on the menu that they ran out of but I decided to go ahead and give this place 4 stars because the most of the food was pretty good and I did like the southern style ambiance. Next time I will come here for dinner not brunch!",

My husband and I had brunch at Haberdish for his birthday today, and I am beyond impressed. I wish we had come sooner! We started with cocktails and hush puppies. Our waiter recommended beverages for us based on types of liquor we like and his recommendations were delicious! The presentation was excellent with a mini carnation frozen in the ice cube. Love! The hush puppies are out of this world good. I could've had another order, to myself, and been so satisfied, but I wanted to fit into my pants tomorrow.   We were deciding between the half chicken or each ordering individually because I wanted to try the chicken tenders. The waiter suggested we do both and it was way too much food, but delicious nonetheless. We also ordered the house dill pickles and the macaroni and cheese. The pickles are AMAZING and the mac'n'cheese was good but I've had better.   For my husbands birthday, the served him a banana pudding with vanilla wafers great in a mason jar. It was adorable and so delicious. I am so impressed and I can't wait to bring out of town friends. I want more hush puppies now so we will be back soon!",

In December we brought friends for fried chicken, sweet potato dumplings, bacon okra, smoked chicken and a variety of house cocktails.  It was truly honestly fantastic!    We took a second bunch of friends visiting from LA in March and it was good but collards were a bit bitter, chicken a little underdone, ribs were ok and service was slow (cocktails still terrific)     Try to get there around 5pm otherwise it gets crowded.  You can park at the Y across the street after hours.    Give it a go.. not a bad choice.",

There is a big dining room, a nice deck when it's warm (it's covered and functional in colder weather, too), and a decent-sized bar. You can go for weekend brunch or lunch/dinner any day of the week.  Their cocktail menu is never anything less than stellar. They have at least a dozen signature cocktails that are always evolving. They can whip up anything your heart desires, too.  Other than the mains, the menu is mostly small plates (but still decent portion sizes!). Most people will choose from fried chicken or ribs. As a vegetarian, I enjoy their fried cauliflower with chimichurri sauce. I can eat almost any side. Their house-made pickles and deviled eggs ROCK. The mac n cheese is too creamy for my style but the sweet potato dumplings are delicious. Next time, I'm trying dessert.  They use the Yelp waitlist, and you should be prepared for a long wait. Grab a drink and get ready - it's worth it!",

    "text": "This is a long over due review.   We went to Haberdish with a large group of 10 people (this is to be avoided in the future as the restaurant isn't really able to accommodate this large of a party -- reserve for date night or dinner with one other couple). Although we called ahead, used no wait app -- we still waited 40 minutes.   The wait really wasn't a huge deal to me. We posted up by the bar, perused the cocktail list and got busy sipping! I ordered 'The Local Melon' - Doc Porter's vodka watermelon and lime juice, sweet basil bitters, cracked black pepper and a salted rim. It was divine! I made the mistake of adding it without the flowered ice cube. The second one I ordered I got the flowered ice cube. Note: do not forget to ask for the ice cube. While their drinks can stand on their own as far as looks and taste go... they become instantly Instagram enviable when you get the gorgeous ice cube!!   Once we were seated, we ordered biscuits and bacon jam for the table. The biscuits were good - not great. I love a really fresh and fluffy biscuit. These were a little denser and drier. The bacon jam though -- I'm currently licking my lips thinking about it -- yes, it was that good! I ordered the roasted chicken and sweet potato dumplings. My goodness! Those little dumplings were delicious! Tender and sweet. I highly recommend them. The roast chicken was actually very tender and juicy. I really liked it. I know most people come for the fried chicken (which my husband ordered and it was great) but be open to the roasted chicken if you feel you need something lighter - you will not be disappointed.   The ambience is cool. Lots of grey shiplap interior. With sort of an old timey feel. Very clean. There is a cool exterior area that I would love to be seated in next time I'm there.   Overall-I was really pleased with our experience and I look forward to our return.",

My dark meat was good (nothing to write home about) but my boyfriend's white meat wasn't fully fried and the breading was mushy. And the mac and cheese isn't stringy cheesy but saucy cheesy, if you're into that. Best part was the banana pudding. Not sure if we caught an off night, but if I come back, it won't have been my first choice.",

The food has never disappointed us, and the service has always been amazing. The alabama white sauce tossed with the baked chicken is drool worthy. I highly recommend the mac and cheese with chicken skins. But really, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu, I've pretty much tried it all. If you're going with a group of people, split a punch bowl, it'll save you some serious $ on drinks. My only complaint here (if any) is the drinks. They tend to put a ton of ice in your glass, and give you a small portion of alcohol. Their drinks are refreshing but somewhat syrupy. Other than that, 10/10 we always recommend Haberdish to friends!",

My favorite thing to do here is to come as a foursome and eat family style (which is also their recommendation). We get one whole fried chicken and 3 sides and it's more than enough to leave us all FULL and HAPPY. :)   Last time we got the livermush appetizer on toast which was good, but a little small for a shared appetizer. We got the whole chicken and our 3 sides were the kale salad, the macaroni and cheese (with the added fried chicken skin crumbles on top, of course) and the sweet potato dumplings. They were all delicious.  The cocktail game is also on point here. I love their mules. They do a solid Moscow Mule and Kentucky Mule (with bourbon).   And, at the end of the night, we didn't have sticker shock on our bill due to the fair pricing and family style eats. We'll be back for many double date nights or friend groups to come.",

This is absolutely a place where you don't have to run to your favorite beer as a safe choice.  I'm still completely obsessed with the flower filled ice balls.  As good as some of the cocktails are at the bars in NoDa, this little detail is a nice touch to make the drinks stand out.  As for the food, absolutely yes to the fried chicken.  I also tasted the chicken tenders again and they were moist with less breading (MUCH better than the first time I was here).  The real winner of my visits though was the Chicken & Biscuit special during the week.  If you like chicken pot pie (seriously, who doesn't love chicken pot pie?!?!), you need to order this dish.  The Mac has always been a bit salty (which is my speed), so you may want to order some veggies to offset the sodium intake.  I'm glad I continue to come back here, because it gets better each time.  Service has always been a little slow, so be prepared to come in and relax with some friends and have a casual meal.",

    "text": "Want to love this place...but it's starting to slip. Starting with the decor--tables are weirdly sticky on top, and one of the metal chair backs bent backwards when my partner sat in it. The waitress just shrugged and said \"yeah they've been known to do that.\" Whaaaat?! Didn't make my 73 year old mother feel too safe. Craft cocktails are inspired, so kudos there. Food Menu is very limited (prompting our out of town guests to ask if \"that was it\"-yikes!), which is okay if the food is always exemplary--it's not. The deviled eggs are always good. The cauli-steak with chimichurri is *usually* good, but inconsistent. Mac and cheese....depends on the day. Roasted chicken and fish are usually okay. Just expect a little better than what they've been putting out the last three visits...not enticed to go back any time soon.",

    "text": "I loved this experience! I did so much researching before we came to Charlotte on the best spots to go and this one was at the top of many lists. I LOVED the vibe here, both the indoor and outdoor seating were nice and it just felt so trendy. We came early and were second in a long line and by noon this place was packed.  Cocktails: I got the spiked pineapple cocktail, which could be skipped, go for the instagram worthy mint julep instead. If something is supposed to have jalapenos I want to taste that spice and this one lacked (just tasted of pineapples and no cool flower in my drink either).  Food: We split a bunch of stuff which I thought was the way to go. You can skip the deviled eggs, they were good but nothing out of this world. I would definitely order the hush puppies and the biscuits, but the stars of the entire meal were the chicken tenders and the corn bread pudding. That fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had and the corn bread pudding was such an unexpected pleasant surprise. It had a perfect char and the combination with the gruyere cheese was amazing. Awesome spot in NoDa! I'm coming back for that mint julep!",

I had seen photos of the food on instagram and that made the anticipation of getting our meals even more. I was thrilled when our food came out looking exactly like the photos and wasn't just a nice look for the pictures (that's rare) the Mac and cheese was amazing we got the fried chicken skins on top and when it came out it had a spicy sauce on top and it was INCREDIBLE our server even gave us some to go!

The fried chicken is delicious and that habanero hot sauce is a must try if you like spicy food. Don't let \"habanero\" scare you away though, it's not that spicy. The batter on the chicken has great seasoning and a slight touch of sweetness. The kale grits were creamy and perfectly cooked -- tender but not seized. Now, there was a miss, the smoked deviled eggs -- those were not my favorite. By the time they are boiled and deviled then smoked, the egg white was rubbery and unpleasant. However, if you like pickles, they seem to always have at least a couple types on their menu at any given time. I always order them both. My friends really loved the pimento cheese - I wasn't wowed by it, I thought it was a bit under-seasoned, but I thought it was still pretty good. Now for the drinks -- I find they make a very nice drink, but their cocktail menu hangs out on the sugary side of the spectrum.",

    "text": "Great restaurant!  I had been seeing this restaurant all over social media so I was really interested to see if it was actually worth the hype or just another trendy Charlotte restaurant with high prices and mediocre food. Very glad to report that the food was delicious and the prices actually aren't that bad (besides the drinks)!   We were immediately sat on a Wednesday night around 8.  Still a happening place, but not overly crowded. Really nice atmosphere with simple industrial decor. We ordered the Mac and cheese, two tenders, kale salad, hush puppies, and deviled eggs.  We got all the small plates and it was plenty of food for us to feel satisfied.  I really liked it all, but was most surprised about how good the kale salad ended up being.  With so many other unhealthy/delicious options it was a bit hard to order kale, but it was super great with goat cheese and some delicious crunchy topping.  I'm of the mindset that Mac and cheese and fried chicken are always good, but I do think theirs may be above average.  The Mac and cheese was super creamy and the honey mustard for the chicken was amazing!  Deviled eggs were good, but as a deviled egg connoisseur, I do feel that they could have used a little more spice or something to help them not be as basic.    Only complaint would probably be the price of the drinks.  We got two drinks and the drinks almost ended up being the same price of our entire meal when we got our bill.  I got the red flower which I wouldn't recommend as it is just basically a small glass of champagne with a flower in it.  I only ordered it bc I thought it was going to have this fancy ice flower in it that I saw on Instagram, but I was sadly mistaken.  Apparently you have to ask for the fancy ice flower (next time I will be prepared!!).  Overall it would be nice if they had some cheaper drink options or at least drink specials like most restaurant do during the week, but I do plan on going back and can't wait to try the okra and cauliflower.  Oh, and for brunch!",

My dad and I were wrapping up some Christmas shopping and noticed there was no line for lunch!   My dad and I popped in and were instantly hungry by all the amazing smells filling the restaurant. Most note worthy were the multiple plates of fried chicken leaving the kitchen.   The menu is on the smaller side, but everything on it they are doing right!. We ordered the mac and cheese (with the hot sauce and fried chicken skins on top), the hot side of the day - collard greens, fried chicken, and ribs. Yes our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. Everything we ordered was the definition of comfort food. The mac and cheese was delightful with the kick from the hot sauce and the crunch from the chicken skins, the collard greens were in my dad's opinion the best EVER, and the ribs were smoky and fall off the bone. But the STAR of the event was the fried chicken! Crispy, salty outside and juicy, tender on the inside, some of the best fried chicken I have ever had and I was raised in the South.   In addition to the delicious food, they have craft cocktails and beers on tap. My dad got the founder's stout which was aged in oak barrels and so creamy smooth and I got the holiday Moscow mule which was a fun twist on one of my favorite cocktails.   We are looking forward to going back when my brother is in town!",

    "text": "I was so excited to finally go to Haberdish because I've heard so many great things about it and I have to say it mostly lived up to the hype. My husband and I went on a Thursday night and still had to wait at least 45 minutes, so pretty safe to say no matter when you go, be prepared to wait. Even with a packed house, our waitress was very attentive and gave great service.   We started with the pimento cheese ball and the house pickles for appetizers. I wasn't wowed by either of these, neither were bad but I've definitely had better pimento cheese in charlotte. The cheese ball was covered in pecans and had a chipotle taste to it, just wasn't my style. For dinner I got the two piece fried  chicken (all white meat) and my husband got the chicken fingers. The chicken was fantastic! It had great seasoning and the tenders were so big that two were more than enough for a meal. For sides we got mac and cheese and the pickled coleslaw which were both also amazing. The coleslaw was so different from anywhere else I have had before.   Overall the food was great, so don't let the long wait deter you.",

    "text": "We met some friends in Charlotte recently and wanted to try a new spot of course. She sent me a list of 6 places, we chose Haberdish. The pics and reviews were so enticing. It was an excellent choice. I will admit, I was taken aback by the small menu. But that shows confidence, and they have a little something to be confident about.  We ordered hush puppies for the table - and then we ordered another round. They were so so so good.  I went off the rails with my order, I had liver mush toast and a side of okra. Most of my friends know I love ordering from the appetizer menu, I'm not sure why - but I do. My husband had the smoked chicken. And we ordered macaroni for the little one. Disclaimer - The only reason we order her a meal is because it came with milk. It's usually a waste of money because she eats our food. She did not eat the mac and cheese, but my husband ate it. Our friends ordered the half fried chicken, kale grits, the mac and cheese with bacon crumbles. I tasted the grits. They were ssoooo good. My mouth is starting to water right now, hmm go figure.  Also, I love the decor and feel of this restaurant (just had to throw that in).  Would I try this place again, absolutely. Would I recommend it, also-freakin-lately, oh and I have recommended it several times.  Sorry, I completely forgot to say - great wait staff!!!  Parking is tight in the NoDa area. But it's still worth the trip. Besides once you find a space you should just walk around and enjoy it.",

It was a rough night so we couldn't wait to fill up on fried chicken. Ordered half, Mac n cheese with the skin, kale salad and the corn bread pudding. Fried chicken had lots of flavors, meat was still juicy. I loved the kale salad. I had it all to myself. Mac n cheese was good. We could have gone without the corn bread. It was on the drier side. The price was very reasonable.   I love the decor. It reminded of fixer upper of HGTV. The serving dishes are a bit vintage and they have these amazing barn doors. Southern chic at its finest.",

I'm a chef in Charleston, SC; there are more southern restaurants than I could describe; I am from Charlotte originally and I knew after I read the menu, I just had to go. How proud I was to see Haberdish, rep Anson Mills!   I seriously have no idea what the comment is about \"don't get the Mac and cheese\" I had the chorizo Mac and cheese and it was, simply amazing. I got the livermush toast, (OMG the cornbread pudding!!!!!) the deviled eggs and the beignet like hush puppies that were awesome, the collards with what seemed to be osso boco broth, because of the delicious pork jus like liquid in those collards were out of this world. Everything was amazing, I wanted to cry in Joy, so proud to be a southerner and a chef and get completely blown away by the passion and simplicity of the restaurant, $12 for a half chicken!!!!!? The fried chicken made anything I've ever eaten before, seem like a pile of mud. In other words, the BEST fried chicken I have ever had. Thank you, thank you, please don't open another store, haha, crown and jewel! Simply.... AWEsome!",

    "text": "First, here's what has to happen to get at ***** review.   * Staff is uneven. Some care, some don't. Waitress for the evening disappeared without a word to go home. Had to ask bartender for check ... which she processed with a great attitude. Welcome was underwhelming for a party of four, all above age 65. We had a total of four waiters plus a runner. Attending to the table was poor with us twice getting up from the table to ask for more wine, for example. Checking backing with the table was unacceptable with large times between even asking if we were ready to order. * Wine prices are double full retail or more. This is unacceptable. The Jordan Chardonnay can be found in stores for around $30-32; their price was $70. Since this is more of a bar than a restaurant, and since their wine list is so very small -- though nicely chosen -- I would not visit again with wine drinkers. We chose the Stellina Pinot Gringio (2 bottles) and the Jordan Chardonnay. * It seems that they are, in part, chef driven. The \"Biscuits & Jam\" had to be replaced because the biscuits were too hard to eat! This should not have been served! I actually took my knife and banged on the biscuit before it was removed! However, the deviled eggs are spectacular and recommended. The pimento cheese ball was also a hit. These are, of course, perfect bar food items and not restaurant appetizers but \"snacks\" as listed on the menu. Another favorite was the Liver Mush Toast. I asked if it was Neese's (a local provider less than one mile away), and the waitress was unsure. It was recommended by the clean plate, though. * The two entrees came with nothing ... that's nothing! No bread, no waffles, no nothing; all was a la carte. The pan fried trout was well cooked but a bit salty. The fried chicken was crunchy beyond belief; it makes KFC Extra Crispy seem soggy. For my taste, this experience reminded me of crunching ice, and the herbs in the copious breading gave an odd sense of burnt (which it wasn't) frying. For real Southern fried chicken, I suggest changing the breading to something traditional and frying in one of your cast iron skillets and not in a deep fryer. Also, the Anson Mills grits with kale is just plain weird, It reminded me of Irish steel-cut oats. BTW, I am an Anson Mills customer, just so you know. * The banana pudding was a huge hit.  If you're looking for a neighborhood bar with aspirations of \"sports\" and the loud pop music that often accompanies, and you're hungry for good bar food, this would be a fine choice. The care that is taken with the food is uneven (yes, I observed the kitchen) and it depends on when you come and the age of your party; young, energetic tables seem to attract the most attention. In some ways, this is understandable, but it in others it is just stupid. Our table of four old guys dropped an over $200 tab while the table of four cute girls next over spent a total of $55. 'nuff said?",

    "text": "Is everyone else drinking the Kool-Aid? The fella and I made a special trip to NoDa from Fort Mill to hit Haberdish, and we got there 2 minutes after they opened. There were already two groups at the bar and three groups seated; apparently this is the hot ticket in town.  I loved the atmosphere - twinkling lights, a magical bar, cozy lighting, and massive, wooden garage doors that open up to the outdoor patio on nice days. There are two unobtrusive TVs over the bar so you can keep up with the games, too.  We started with the pimento cheese ball ($9). We were hoping for a good, Southern pimento cheese, but it was a little sweet and didn't have much of a kick. It was rolled in pecans and served with Granny Smith apple slices and crackers. Huh.  For dinner, I got the fried chicken tenders($2.50 per)  and sweet potato dumplings ($4). The chicken tenders were pretty bland, but the honey mustard cleared my sinuses. When the dumplings didn't look like dumplings, I asked the waitress about it... she said they mistakenly brought the bread pudding. She left the bread pudding and brought dumplings. Ironically enough, I liked the bread pudding better. The dumplings were covered in Parmesan cheese, so they lost all sweetness I was expecting from sweet potatoes.  The fella got the fried chicken ($6 leg and thigh), and he said it was pretty bland, too. He got the macaroni and cheese as a side ($4), and although it was cheesy, it was pretty thin. I like a thick, hearty cheese, so perhaps that's just an opinion thing?  Our waitress Marnie was nice enough, but it took so long to get a drink that we almost canceled our order. Apparently the bartenders bring the drinks, not the waiters, but when we asked where our drink was, she said, \"Oh, that comes from the bar.\" Ummm, could you maybe check on it?  Man, I hate that we had such a blah experience because I was SO excited to try Haberdish. Thankfully, Crepe Cellar is right next door.",

The menu was sparse, not sure if that is just a Sunday brunch menu thing or if it's always like that. But it worked out great because the fewer options means that they specialize in certain items...and less indecisiveness from me. We ordered the half fried chicken, brussel sprouts, the sweet potato dumplings and the okra. Everything tasted fresh and satisfying! It was a little greasy, but what else do you expect from a southern restaurant. Haberdish is definitely a good place to come with a few people so you can order a couple of side dishes and sample everything.",

We were really blown away with our entrees (trout and ribs which were both delectable) and loved the small details like flowers in the ice cubes in our drinks. The ribs were the best i have tasted and soooo meaty. The sweet potato dumplings were DELISH. Unlike the other bartender who was blah and unenthusiastic when we asked questions and tried to make conversation (maybe she was sleepy), Christina sold us on everything and had excellent rapport and knowledge. Which is vital as a bartender!  There are TONS of restaurants/bars in Charlotte but service like hers and great food sets you apart. She is excellent and i appreciate the great dining experience.",

    "text": "It's fancy southern food. The menu is very simple. Pretty much fried chicken or fried chicken with some sides. Large portions are great to share. Some appetizers were just funny to me like cheese straws  (I got them) and boiled peanuts...you know, like the things you get in a huge styrofoam cup from the guy on the side of the road.    Atmosphere was nice. Very open fancy farmhouse feel. Ball jar glasses, candle light , but get ready to hear every thing the table beside you is talking about. The tables are really close. At one point our neighboring tables server had to reach over and her butt was pretty much in my face. I had to lean over.    Ok, lets talk booze. The beer selection was mediocre at best. I asked for a local beer and was offered wicked weed. When I explained I wanted a Charlotte beer she told me they only had one!  I am a person who will make a decision on where to eat based on the beer selection. I know I'm not the only one so I hope this helps somebody out there.  The cocktail list on the other hand was huge. I'm not a cocktail drinker but that list and looking around at other tables made me want one. They were really pretty and cool looking.   So after all that, would I go back? No, but if my  non southern  friends come in from out of town I would take them there. It was nice and the food was good. If they up the beer game I may give it another try.",

Tried the livermush app - it was burnt so very disappointing.  Smoked deviled eggs tasted okay-smoke gave it new twist, but the yolk portion was bland.  The smoked chicken was super yummy and fall off the bone tender. Okra, cheese straws, and kale grits were very good also.  Tasted fried chicken it was also good but heavily breaded compared to light at crispy.  This place will be good for a quick bite and i can see it being a hot spot as it warms up and they open up the patio.

    "text": "Haberdish is just the right vibe every Charlotte neighborhood needs. Indoor/outdoor seating, community and personal table options, long bar with unique drinks such as \"Red Flower\" and \"Love Potion\" aperitifs and \"Luck be the Lady\" spirit. Great wine bottle prices too- i.e. California Pinot noir as low as $25.   We tried the deviled eggs and hush puppies for apps. The eggs have a hint of bacon or bologna? taste- very unique. The hush puppies are out of this world!!!! Melt in your mouth with the best batter imaginable.   For the main course, we had the fried chicken tenders, Mac n Cheese with fried chicken skins, and charred okra with bacon jam. For dipping sauce, we had ranch and honey mustard. I recommend the ranch bc the honey mustard was more so a honey Dijon which is not what I prefer with chicken tenders. Chicken was meaty with a great batter, the skins in the Mac and cheese was delicious and made your spoon keep coming back for more, and any okra lover will adore Haberdish's version.   And the great thing is- you can order small or large sides depending on how you want to share. The small side is definitely big enough for two people! And the chicken tenders are priced per tender, so get as few or as many as you would like. For me, one tender was enough with all the apps and sides we had- just to at least get a taste of their famous fried chicken.  Excellent restaurant! We will be back.",

Here's the thing, I know they are poised for expansion and that is a good thing due to the awkward layout of the bar relative to staff needing to maneuver about the restaurant.  The bar area should have enough space to queue waiting patrons.  This one is a bit too tight to allow this.  And when you have a popular place such as this, that can be problematic.  With that out of they way, let's get to the food.  The food is divine.  Southern divine.  Just take a look at some of the photos and you'll get the idea.  I don't feel like I need to get into too much detail here in that regard.  The seating is nice and comfy and the wait staff was quick to deliver with a side dish of politeness to boot.  The acoustics are a bit tough but I find that to be the case anywhere such as this place where they have retrofitted an otherwise non-restaurant space.  A few acoustic baffles may help but doesn't really detract in my opinion.  In short, this is a solid addition to NoDa and I'm sure it will expand and grow into another staple for the hood.",

Their Negronis are in an ice filled glass with a rose trapped within the ice sphere which really gives it an elegant touch.  Their food prices are extremely reasonable on your wallet. For \"tapas\" style dishes, you really get heavy portions for your money. I suggest getting the 1/2 lb fried chicken for two, along with a few sides. Their smoked deviled eggs, charred okra, and mac and cheese are all delicious! Perfect date night spot, or for large parties too. Be sure to get on the nowait app to reserve a spot ahead of time!",

    "text": "Was overall very pleased trying out this new spot in Noda. A group of us went on a Saturday evening, and knowing it'd be crazy, looked into reservation options. Luckily, you can add your name to the waitlist right from the Yelp app!  The deviled eggs were fresh, sides including mac & cheese and carrots were really good, and the chicken tenders were tasty, though if you're picky about chicken and don't like a heavy breading when fried, it may not be the best menu choice for you. The sweet potato dumplings were just ok. The mint juleps were refreshing and served in nice glasses.  Will definitely try it again, perhaps for brunch when some of the buzz dies off a bit.",

They don't take reservations but the no wait app helps a lot (or you can use Yelp). You just have to try and time it right. And if you have to wait still (which we did), enjoy a cocktail from their robust list. The fried chicken (we had dark meat) and chicken tenders were quite good. I especially liked the Alabama white sauce. Best items we had were the hush puppies, which were the best I've ever had and the homemade tots. I also really like the sweet potato dumplings. Cool experience with good food. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I ran across Haberdish via the \"Nowait\" app.  My boyfriend is always in search of the best fried chicken- so we decided to give it a shot for Sunday brunch.  We started off with the biscuits & bacon jam.  The bacon jam was so meaty and delicious, it was great.  The biscuits were ok- while beautiful and golden brown on the outside, they were in fact slightly under baked.  This should have been foreshadowing...  For the main course we both opted for the chicken and waffles (you can select your chicken- we both opted for 2pc white).  The chicken was good- juicy, crispy fried skin, very good fried chicken - I think it could be improved with a bit more seasoning.  I just wish our server had offered us the hot sauce!!  In fact, I think it would be pretty cool if you could choose a dip (i.e. offer \"hot chicken\").   The waffle- it's a traditional liege-style waffle batter that is more of a dough base.  My issue was- both of our waffles were egregiously undercooked: the outsides were a beautiful brown/caramel color and the insides were raw dough (which according to our server is how they are meant to be??? Raw dough??? Ok...I know raw dough when I see it...).    We'll return- perhaps it was a rough morning- and we'll probably just stick to the fried things. :)",

Dish is your typical southern food that tastes like what your grandmother makes. Haberdish, is that, but with an amazing culinary expansion.  Everything we are was fantastic.  I wasn't raised in the south, so the typical southern fare isn't familiar to me and doesn't strike that childhood chord, but this place blew me away. I was caught off guard to say the least.   The biscuit with bacon jam is one of the best dishes in Charlotte.  And the fried chicken, forget about it.",

We went family style all the way; fried chicken, kale salad, okra and banana pudding. For $60 (without tip) we walked out completely satisfied and with leftovers.  The kale salad had a smooth flavor which included fruit and cheese.  I've not had this combination of flavors ever.  The okra with bacon jam was sensational.   And no, the okra was not slimy instead more sauteed.   Really good.  The chicken was flavorful ,moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Last but least, the $6 banana pudding was the perfect amount for 3 people to top off a great meal.   Very pleased.  Okay...the music was a bit loud for conversation.  There...I complained about something.",

    "text": "There are two restaurants in Charlotte that feed both the body and the soul - Haberdish is one of them.  First off, kudos to the creative name: the haberdashery of quality dishes. \"Haberdish.\"  The fried chicken is perfection. I thought another restaurant in town had the best overall chicken, but Haberdish is, hands down, better in every way.  The sides are on a whole 'nother level. I'm an avowed carnivore/omnivore, but their side dishes are so good that they may make you forget the chicken. Try all of them.  The sweet potato dumplings are a show-stopper - butter, sage... just glut yourself. You won't regret it.  The cornbread pudding is like the sweet, delicious, southern Jiffy cornbread staple but turned up so much that Spinal Tap would be jealous.  The cocktails are delicious and well-made, so Haberdish can double as a good place to catch the spirit(s) while chilling at the bar.  I hate writing this review because I'll rue the day that getting in here will be damned difficult. Parking is already a problem (it's NoDa, so that's not Haberdish's fault), so be sure to Uber/Lyft/cab it out there.  In conclusion, it's my and my fiancee's favorite restaurant in Charlotte.",

It seemed like most people got their food long before us. The food itself was delicious, though. The sweet potato dumplings were great, as was the kale salad. My table mates had some chicken tenders and said they were very good, as were the kale grits and barbecue carrots.

If you love bloody Mary's you'll love theirs  The 2nd drink I got was the spritzer; really light and refreshing.. definitely enjoyed it   We ordered the house fried dill pickles but they were out of it so the lady that took our order suggested the spears. We didn't know they would be deep fried. They were still amazing! Loved it and even better that it saved me the calories. They tasted like those cucumbers soaked in vinegar (how funny) that you eat at cookouts or that childhood snack.  Mac n cheese with chicken skins- I'm very picky with mac n cheese, I'm more of that baked crusted type of gal. So I was intrigued with this one. Not so bad it was good, definitely thick and not runny and the chicken skins did give it some flavor but it wouldn't hurt if they revamped it. The chicken skins as toppings didn't do it for me.   Hush puppies- OH-M-G were so good, best I ever had. They're just hush puppies though right? But the best. And the spread they had to go along with it was the right amount of sweetness to compliment it",

The ambience was chill, southern inspired.  There were copper accents throughout. The utensils, lights, shelves, were all copper.  On Sundays they have chicken and waffles. You choose your type of chicken (dark, white or tenders) and the waffle add on is $4. We ordered the huspuppies to start. The texture was fantastic. They were crispy on the outside and pillowy soft inside, served with sweet tea butter. We both opted for the chicken and waffles, white meat. For the sides, which are served family style, we got mac n cheese (w/crispy chicken skins), and sweet potato dumplings. The chicken was wonderful! Crispy,  juicy and well seasoned. The mac and cheese was ok. Nothing to rave about. The dumplings weren't good at all, we'll pass on those next time.  Drink wise, the menu is decent. Lots of craft cocktails, good bourbon and beer selection. I had the peachy keen with flower ice. The ice had a full rose inside. They don't have coke or Pepsi products, instead offering house made sodas.  All in all, it was good. We'll definitely return. Good service as well. Great spot for apps and drinks for sure.",

As the hostess was seating us, he came by and asked us what we wanted to drink - BEFORE BUTTS WERE IN SEATS. We said we obviously needed a few minutes and he took that to mean I'll come back in 20. And from there, his attitude just got worse, not sure why he's working in hospitality if he hates people.  As for the food, the fried chicken was good but nothing special, lacked seasoning and flavor. The bacon jam biscuits are to be avoided! Biscuits are good but smothered with the terrible bacon jam, I mean just covered to the point you can't even see the biscuits. The mac and cheese side tastes like there's only flour in the roux, way too starchy. The only standout dish for us were the hush puppies and kale grits, and if that's the star of the show, then it says a lot about this place as we ordered a ton of food!",

When I ordered the mac & cheese, I truly had a mind blowing experience because my server asked if I wanted spicy fried chicken skin crumbles on top!? \"Excuse me, what did you just say?!\"  And yes. It was as delicious as it sounds. The other sides we got were savory corn bread pudding and sweet potato gnocchi. We sampled each other's and continued to rave about each dish! Honestly, one of the best dining experiences we've ever had! Highly recommend!!",

The habonero sauce is delicious! I got the deviled eggs topped with trout and the coleslaw. Perhaps a weird combo but it was perfect. Service was outstanding! My water glass never got half empty. I will definitely be back to try more menu items and to try something stronger than water : ) I hear the cocktails are great.",

I will definitely come back and try it out again as the food was good, but our service was horrible. We weren't informed how the dishes would come out or how big they would be; and for a table of 4 we ordered way too much food. We all got different cocktails and they were amazing. For food, we ordered: the house pickles to try out, two orders of the cauliflower steak (loved it, but definitely too much for us), fried chicken white (which was great), tenders (waitress did not help us figure out how many would be good for one person, so he ended up getting a few), small tots, large dumplings-so many came in this size and they were so filling we could only eat a few of them, an order of the kale grits-different texture, they were pretty tasty, definitely worth trying out, large mac & cheese, and large okra. Food was okay, but I was expecting a little more. I will definitely give them another try since our first experience was so bad and the amount of food will have to be adjusted! Great location and love the vibe and atmosphere, I'm sure the patio will be great once it warms up more.",

    "text": "Wish I had gotten a chance to TRY Haberdish!  Planned to go with some friends on Dec. 20th - following the instructions on the recorded message on the restaurant phone, we downloaded the wait list app they recommended and were advised of a 15-to-25 minute wait time and told what time we should be at the restaurant so as not to lose our place in line.  We arrived promptly at the designated time, and, after the hostess scanned electronically what looked like a huge list of names, she advised us that it would be another 30-35 minutes before we could be seated. Although they have no designated seating area for waiting, we found space at the bar....and waited....and waited.  After 35 minutes, I approached the hostess again to ask if we were making progress.  At that time, she informed me that the wait list app was not working correctly and had given us a much shorter time frame for a table than what the reality was and that it would be \"at least\" another 30-45 minutes before we could be seated (making for a total wait time after adding our name to the list of over an hour).  Of course,  our party of five left and went elsewhere, taking our appetites and money with us.  On a positive note, the two appetizers we had at the bar - charred okra and hush puppies - were delicious and I would love to try more of Haberdish's cuisine - but not until they work out the kinks in or totally discard the wait list app they recommend. The phone message is quite misleading; the messages the app sends regarding wait time are, as well.  And, in our case, it led to a most disappointing experience.  My advice would be to discontinue recommending a system that doesn't work, and either start taking reservations or simply say you don't take reservations.",

My husband loved his food and mine was okay too.  My husband had the dark chicken and it was slightly overcooked.  I had the chicken tenders, which were also overcooked, but the breading was great.  The sides (mac 'n cheese, grits and okra) were good.  We chose to sit outside on the covered patio and I wish that we hadn't because there was a cloud of flies that we were swatting away our entire time there.

That being said, tonight's take-out was twice as good as Bojangles and four times the price. Ordered our favorites to try at home because we're not big fans of, well, people. Hush puppies, chicken tenders, tater tots, and mac and cheese--all delicious in restaurant. Expecting quality to go down a fraction (as is the case with all takeout) I just couldn't swallow paying $50 for cold food, and portions much smaller than in restaurant. It insults my intelligence when restaurants think I can't tell that they've halved the portions. The chicken tenders are huge when you eat there, they were measly for takeout. The mac and cheese  was dried up and half the normal size. Was given one sauce per person (two of us) and the small ramekins were half full, maybe one tablespoon worth. Lastly, I was given a to-go tea and coke, in to-go cups, with zero ice. Didn't even ask the bartender to fix it, just tipped him $5 and got the hell out of there. The order was $50 and I wished we would have just went to Chic-fil-a.",

Speaking of the devil, the Deviled Eggs are perfection especially since you get two double halves per order (no fighting over that odd half like other places make you because they are chinchy or the cook was hungry). If you are on a date, gotta try the pickled veggies of the day - fondly brings out that pucker face you know you wanna see. The Kale Citrus Salad is refreshing and crisp.

I would have gladly paid more without a blink!  Go!!!  I repeat, Haberdish shows up!!",

So I asked a colleague  to meet me there to cap off a stressful work week. The drink menu was very interesting. If you enjoy craft cocktails then you will enjoy the offerings. It was not easy to decide; however I ended up ordering The Apothecary Cocktail and it was worth it -  a bit pricey but definitely worth it!  As my meal I ordered a variety of sides (carrots, corn pudding, deviled eggs, pimento cheese)... EVERYTHING ... WAS... AMAZING!!!",

    "text": "Walked in on a Sunday morning to a pretty empty Establishment. The host asked \"inside our outside?\" And I said inside, and even repeated myself. Well they walked us right through the restaurant to a back door for a side patio--outside. Great. It's covered so we thought it may not be so hot even though it's the middle of May and there is a brutal heat wave. Our server was very kind and knowledgeable, but every table that was sat after us had their food before we ever gave her our orders. The air on the patio was STAGNANT, even though I saw a huge industrial fan sitting by the door, not plugged in. The gnats and flies were extremely annoying, another problem which could be fixed by turning on a large outdoor fan. By the time we finished our food and settled the bill, one member of our party was SO hot just from sitting outside, that he threw up. The food was good, but the lack of attention to our requests, as well as apparent lack of attention to details was a huge turn off. Probably won't be back.",

    "text": "HABERDISH.  First dinner my girlfriend and I went to after moving to Charlotte. Boy, did we pick a great place to make our introduction to our new city.  Since we live in NoDa, it was a quick walk to the restaurant since its right on North Davidson. It was poppin on a Thursday night and we asked to sit outside. There's a good bit of seating out front and a ton inside, and then to the left of the main dining area there is a sort of inside/outside eating area that is semi-enclosed by a roof, but gives you all the feeling of sitting outside except the sun in your face.   I started off with the Besame Tequila cocktail that was pretty to look at AND delicious. Sometimes you don't get both! It was very sweet, and might not have gone too well with the food we ended up ordering, but oh well.   My girlfriend and I ordered the biscuits with bacon jam, friend chicken tenders (we are obviously children), kale grits, and hushpuppies with sweet tea butter.  Hands down the best thing was the biscuits with bacon jam. The \"jam\" was literally pieces of bacon mixed with God knows what that was smothered all. over. the biscuits. It was amazing. 10/10 would bacon jam again.  The hushpuppies were fried to perfection and the sweet tea butter was damn good. I'd eat that on any kind of bread.  Chicken tenders, very solid. It came with four different dipping sauces which is always a plus.They're also sold individually so you don't get pigeonholed into ordering too much and can still order different things from the menu!  My only slight gripe was the kale grits. Maybe we got a \"meh\" batch, but they definitely needed some salt or some sort of salty cheese. They were still good, just lacked as much flavor as the rest of the dishes. Maybe that was the intent? I'm not sure, but I like my grits' flavor to hit me in the face.  Overall, the food combined with the ambience, and the great service, i would 100% recommend this place if you want some damn good southern cooking. Can't wait to go back to try other dishes!",

They always have a wait and I hate lines which is why it has taken me so long to visit this fine establishment, but I think that speaks well to the quality of their food and friendly waitstaff.   We ordered a medium punch bowl as our drink of choice - the hibiscus one and it was wonderful and refreshing!  For apps/snacks we got both the pimento cheese ball (comes with crackers and apples!) and the hush puppies, which come with sweet tea butter, and omg are those good!  I recommend treating it like tapas and sharing a bunch of things.  We each ordered two of the chicken strips and then split a bunch of slides. Do make sure you try the fried chicken or chicken strips because they are worth it! For sides, we shared mac and cheese of course, a daily special of hot kale and bacon with goat cheese (so good), and the okra - and I don't usually like okra but these were so great, and not fried!   Definitely need to give this place a try if you haven't and brave the lines, or call ahead for a seat! Next, I need to try the brunch!",

We were able to be seated right away, so I recommend going for early dinner!  We got to sit on their gorgeous side patio in the lovely spring weather. There's much more space inside and on the patio than I thought! We started off with their extensive cocktail list and weren't disappointed. My spring fever was original and refreshing, and the Goose loved his take on an old fashioned. Unfortunately our luck with cocktails ran out, and the second round wasn't quite as good. I give all the props to the Goose for finishing his Gibson - it was pretty potent. Drinkers beware.  As for the food, there were some huge hits and a couple of misses. The fried chicken is everything you could want and more, but the fried cauliflower was a bit of a miss. The extra greasy, crunchy coating just wasn't doing it for me. The hushpuppies are a must-try, as well as the corn bread pudding. The mac n cheese was also pretty delicious (but when is it not?).   We were a little bummed because we were told they were out of the sweet potato dumplings, but then we saw them get served to a table that arrived after us. I also still find it frustrating that it's so difficult to get a table! We went back the next night at 8:30pm to get dessert and was told there would be an hour wait - yet there were plenty of empty tables. Wish they took reservations.",

We opted for 8-chicken strips (with all their dipping sauces), small charred okra (with bacon jam), large homemade tater tots, small mac & cheese (with  the spicy skins topping), and small sweet potato dumplings. We ordered just right amount for 2-adults and three kids under 13. My youngest daughter ordered a specialty (not always on the menu) cinnamon roll with a carmel dipping sauce. It was the most amazing cinnamon roll we had ever had and it became our desert as she preferred to eat the chicken when everything came out.  The food here is amazing, atmosphere and location reminds me of my beloved Denver. We ended up eating the covered side porch and even on a cool day, it was comfortable.  The only negative has nothing to do with the restaurant... the parking in the NoDa area is terrible for lunch on a Saturday! We ended up at a small graveled/dirt pay lot a block down and over that was a couple bucks. Take an uber or bum a ride.  We will be back but not be bringing our vegetarian friends. Not many items on the menu for the vegs but there was so many things that we didn't order but want to try. See you soon Haberdish!",

Definitely a great starter. Next I had the two piece white fried chicken which had the most beautiful, flavorful, somewhat spiced crunchy exterior. The meat was juicy and flavorful. I got the sweet potato dumplings as my side which really just tasted like sweet potato gnocchi. -I wish they had some type of dipping sauce on the side with these. Something like brown sugary...

Highly Recommend!!!",

They have their own sauces for a little kick.  Waffle: The waffle is probably one of my least favorite things on the menu but is still good. The waffle itself has a good flavor but has sugar cubes in it which make it overpowering when you pour syrup on it. Mac and cheese: Mac and cheese is goooood and a must as a side dish.",

The chicken tenders were pretty good, but I'd skip the smoked chicken last time. Was quite pleased with all the sides (mac n cheese, sweet potato dumplings).

My husband and I shared Hibiscus Honey Punch, and it was truly a visually stunning drink. We also had the tater tots, which have just the right amount of Cajun kick to them. Our server was amazing, which was surprising because they were actually in the process of training. To top the night off, they served warm towels for our hands for the fried chicken entree. Choice!!",

They have specific brunch times during the week so be sure to check it out before you just go. But my favorite is there hush puppies. I'm actually surprised they are not the top tasting hush puppies in Charlotte; I think they're just so fluffy and flavorful so my best friend agrees. Thanks for always being great Haberdish, can't wait to go back.",

The space is cute, but I really didn't know what to expect. We started with the cinnamon roll because I love a place that puts dessert as a starter. My kind of people.  The cinnamon roll comes with the sauce on the side - it's more like a dulce de leche sauce. At first I wasn't so sure about it, but oh em gee. It's amazing. It's nice and fluffy with a great amount of cinnamon and then you get to choose how much dulce de leche you apply. Highly recommend.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a chicken tender and my bf ordered biscuits and gravy with a chicken thigh. We ordered some tater tots to split.  Their chicken is so damn good. Get it. Just order the chicken. Everything else is just meant t be with the chicken. The biscuits and gravy were good, too, but I am glad I ordered the tender to go with it.   The tots were awesome! Definitely made in house. Perfect amount of pepper on them. Get those, too.   Honestly just a fabulous meal all around and our service was equally great - we never had an empty cup.",

It was busy but we got seated right away- however they do have the no wait app. I recommend you use it.   All the drinks are seasonal and I instantly knew I was going to order the Egg nog milkshake. Something I would never order with a meal, but it came with bourbon whipped cream. I mean come on! It was absolutely delicious! My friend got the chia cocktail and it was equally as delicious. Everyone else's drinks were also very good and presentation was a perfect 10. I also love that the menu is changed out seasonally but damn that spiked milkshake was so fricken good.   For our meals we split the Mac n cheese (get the chicken skins on top!), devils eggs, corn casserole and chicken tenders/waffle. Not diet friendly.   I personally thought the deviled eggs were one of the best. The whip in the middle was the perfect consistency and very good. I didn't get a waffle, but  chicken tenders were awesome and I loved the homemade honey mustard and ranch with them. Everyone who got them with the waffle said it was very tasty and it came with a spicy maple syrup. Nice blend of flavors.   Now that mac n cheese is where it was at. I could not stop eating it. It was sooo cheesy and good! The chicken skins made the dish and you must order them!!!   Overall great time at Haberdish and I can't wait to go back. I look forward to trying the cauliflower steak and the veggie options they have! And of course, a cocktail!",

We arrived at 6:40 and didn't get our food until 8:00. No exaggeration. Our server took our order then didn't come back until well after we were finished eating. Someone else dropped off our food and left without saying a word. Nobody asked if we needed anything else (we were missing items and didn't have any spoons to scoop food onto our plates). We had to flag another random server down to get what we needed. Nobody ever asked how our food was. All in all, we were there for over 2 hours because service was just so slow!   The majority of time, the food is great! Tonight it was just decent. Mac and cheese came out luke warm and dry. The dragon bean side (one of the specials) was cold and tasted awful, like vinegar and dill. Fried chicken was good as usual.   Not saying I'll never be back, but I'm definitely in no rush!!",

Fried chicken- the larger pieces were undercooked as the batter was still mushy in the inside. The dark meat ones were good. I'd say the fried chicken was pretty average.  Ribs- awesome get them!  Mac n cheese with fried chicken skins - I should have probably sent this back but felt nervous as some one else in our party already was going to mention something about her food. The skins were soo salty I just picked them off.  Smoked chicken half - what my friend had. The chicken was dry like jerky.   Carrots- good get them!  Cabbage- good flavors but too salty again.",

    "text": "Haberdish is a Southern-American restaurant located in the NoDa neighborhood of Charlotte, NC. Its menu features dishes emphasizing locally sourced ingredients and refined Southern classics including fried chicken, biscuits, and mac & cheese.  Atmosphere: nice interior with a hip, rustic vibe and mood lighting. Brick walls, reclaimed wood tables, copper fixtures, and an open layout give the place a more laidback but classy feeling--which more or less sums up the food and drink experience as well. It is a fairly large space with an added room adjoining the main seating area and flexible table arrangements. I'd say small to large groups are all able to be accommodated here. Also, they use the option for live waiting on Yelp, so you can actually check to see how long the wait might be and even put your name down in the queue before you physically get there--a very helpful feature!   Food: while the prices on the menu may be a bit higher than your typical meat & three (and if you have no idea what that is, you're not from the South), it's sometimes nice to see good Southern fare treated in a more elevated manner. Moreover, due to the a-la-carte nature of the menu (proteins and sides each ordered individually), I recommend ordering / eating family style so you can try multiple of their delicious sides. Our group of four adults shared the following:    + House pickles ($4) + Half chicken fried ($14) + Half chicken smoked ($15) + Side order of waffle ($4) + Small side of mac & cheese ($6) + Small side of charred okra ($5) + Small side of sweet potato dumplings ($5) + Small side of kale salad ($7) + Banana pudding ($6)  My favorite dishes were hands down the charred okra, the smoked chicken, and the banana pudding. Everything else was good but those three items were excellent. Also, their house habanero hot sauce was a game changer to eat on the fried chicken. Yum.    Drinks: I was thrilled to see a full page (with three columns worth) of house cocktails. They also had a nice selection of aged whiskeys, wines; there was also a limited but well chosen craft beer list as well. Given the buzz about their cocktails, we opted for those, ordering the:  + Apple of my Rye ($14) - rye based; lovely smell; well spiced, a good, lovely drink for fall + Japanese Cocktail ($14) - remy cognac based; smokey, strong, solid drink + Happy Go Lucky Champagne Punch ($11--also available in larger, shareable sizes) - rum and champagne based; light, refreshing; decorated with a flower ice cube  Service: really terrific; we had an amazing waiter who not only provided us with pleasant service but even a few recommendations, upon request, when we were between a few options. All the staff seemed extremely professional and friendly.   Overall, I would definitely recommend Haberdish if you're in the mood for some refined Southern eats and / or solid cocktail in a well designed, laid-back setting near Uptown Charlotte!",

    "text": "Haberdish gives you a great first impression as you walk in. The bar and the restaurant have the whole Edison light bulb, open brick wall, utilitarian hipster look down, and the wait staff are friendly. Brunch was busy enough that the place appears popular, but not to the point that you decide to try somewhere else. The house julep I got was good. Was it the best I've ever tasted? No, but I did not feel ripped off, and I'm used to NYC and DC pricing.   The food, however? Only the biscuits with fixins transcended beyond \"meh.\" There was a special for the day of maciated strawberries on rice with benne seeds. Translate through the hipster filter: chopped strawberries on rice krispies and sesame seeds. This had the potential to be interesting if there was any flavor, but I have never had strawberries this bland in my life. At least I have an idea of what future synthetic strawberries may taste like if we lose the ability to grow them, and I'm not about it.  The egg tartine also lacked much in the way of seasoning. Even the waffles with fruit disappointed. As plated, the waffles came with a ton of whipped cream. Sounds great, right? Well, the cream melted quickly and the waffles arrived at the table with a very mushy consistency. The place may look promising from outside, but the food did not measure up.",

Beautiful decor and loved the atmosphere.   Fried Chicken was excellent. It was full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Hush puppies were delicious along with the butter they serve with them. Corn bread pudding was ok. They cut it in half so you have one side that is delicious, then the boring side which was somewhat lacking in flavor. I'd rather them not cut it in half. Macaroni and cheese I have mixed feelings about. The cheese sauce was bland but good(needed salt). Pasta was too large which took away from the flavor of the cheese. Last but not least was the banana pudding. It has very good flavor, but too much whip cream and not enough bananas and cookies.   At the end of our meal they brought us warm wet towels to clean our hands. Nice end to such a lovely dinner.   We look forward to coming back for more chicken and trying the other sides!",

We tried to use the NoWait app to get in line when we were on our way, but the app said there was no wait.  Then did not update (despite refreshing) which meant when we arrived we were disappointed there was a 30 min wait.  We decided to wait at the bar.  We ordered drinks - which were OK - and a couple dishes (one of which never arrived).  More than an hour later - 77 minutes to be exact - we still were not seated, the host did not say anything and wasn't that sympathetic to my disappointment in the wait.  It was made worse when another (large) party arrived and were seated almost immediately (ahead of us). When we were seated someone came by and dropped a few appetizers on the table - not knowing what they were, looking perplexed - someone eventually explained they were on the house and what they were. The food was hit or miss.  The hush puppies were fresh and probably the best I've ever had.  The ribs had a good smokey flavor, but they weren't very tender.  The mac n' cheese - my go to side - left something to be desired. All in all, not worth going for another long wait, but it had a lot of potential.",

The macaroni and cheese was rich and delicious but not what he expected. He assumed it would be a baked dish, but this was more like a pasta with cream sauce. I had the trout and okra, both of which were outstanding. The menu is limited, and we were surprised there was no main dish of beef. We loved the ambiance and lighting of the restaurant.

I didn't taste the tea. Just the sweetness. The waffle was already sweat but not in a normal waffle way. It just wasn't that good. I got a breast and a wing with the waffle and the chicken was actually fried perfectly and it was juicy, however it was the type where the batter doesn't stay on the chicken that well. It separates and I just don't like it. It was tasty tho. And the house habanero sauce was pleasant. The price was nice. And the atmosphere was cool they were playing all neo soul like Erykah Badu and D'Angelo. It was a cool vibe but I doubt if I will go back.",

    "text": "Well, come to Charlotte and expect good comfort food, well thank you Haberdish for making this a reality.  We enjoyed our last dinner here and boy was it great. The atmosphere at Haberdish is comfy and sophisticated, once again walking distance to our homebase in Noda. I can't believe how much good food was walking distance from our place.  Haberdish really delivered on the comfort food, with a small menu. When you see a small menu, sometimes it is a bad sign, but many times, a great sign - they have really mastered their art in the form of these foods, choose and be happy.   In this case, the center of the menu was fried chicken, so it was a no-brainer for me - I LOVE fried chicken. This particular fried chicken was everything you would want, it was perfectly portioned, crispy, the right amount of salty, and yet still juicier than the world, inside. I will put this as the top five fried chicken dishes I have had the pleasure to enjoy.   The mac and cheese was fine, nothing to write home about but a good accompaniment. The biscuits with bacon and jam were excellent, a great balance between sweet and salty, on top of flaky and buttery. I might say the biscuits were a bit doughy, but honestly I would be nit-picking at this point.  Overall, a great meal, served by an excellent waiter.",

We went for brunch and I got the chicken and waffles, devil eggs, and cheese straws. The chicken was a great choice because it was moist and very tender. You could cut through it with no problem. I really enjoyed their homemade hot sauce as well.   However, The service was not the best. I believe we got a interesting server who was awkward and not very personable. Is common nature to approach people and have open body language and not stand behind them and ask for their order. I am sure other servers are much more attentive.   I guess I was expecting food that would make me want to come back to this place over and over again but I honestly can't say I'm rushing back to go here for brunch . Nevertheless , I will definitely give it another try but not for brunch. I think I will stick with lunch or dinner here.   I believe that the side items on their brunch menu actually would have been fantastic. I believe the menu is too limited for brunch and they need more traditional brunch items.",

    "text": "Came here with a coworker on a quick trip to NC---  We ran the table with our order so we got to sample a lot.  The Brined Chicken was delightful and moist, drenched in sauce. My only knock is that it's a bit hard to eat since you can't use your hands to eat it, but the only reason you can't use your hands is that it is DRENCHED in delicious Alabama White Sauce! So in the scheme of things, yeah it could be easier to eat but this isn't really something to complain about.  The Chicken tender is truly spectacular. And for $2.50 per it's a steal considering how good it is. If you haven't ordered at least one you're doing it wrong. Almost tastes like the best corn dog you ever had growing up with delicious moist chicken meat. Seriously YUM.  Whatever you get, couple it with a chicken tender so you can experience it. Man, was this good.  Kale salad was a light and tasty balance to the rest of the meal.  Mac and cheese creamy but could use additional components... a bit simple for my palate but still good.  The hash browns were good but not amazing, but if you're looking for hash browns they get the job done!  Kale grits are totally unique but definitely satisfying... wasn't expecting to be wowed but I am so happy I got to try this!  To drink, the Smoked mint julep is not too sweet and definitely smoky if that's your thing... can't beat the presentation! It's not quite MY drink but it is definitely worth trying!  Truly if you get the chicken tenders and go with your gut you will land on something you're satisfied with. We sat one table over from one of the owners and it was clear she has invested considerable thought and emotion into this place and boy has it paid off. Definitely coming back and definitely recommended for anyone coming to Charlotte!",

The spicy honey butter syrup was quite tasty and I ended up mixing it with the other syrup. The waffle is amaZing, probably the best waffle I've ever had. The sugar balls inside provide a nice crunch with the batter that is used. The waffle is definitely a must as well as the Mac and cheese.",

    "text": "First and foremost, I am not the biggest fan of \"Southern Food\", even being from the south myself. Their food was very good, however, I think I had extremely high expectations after talking to friends and reading other yelp reviews that I went in from the viewpoint as if \"the sides and chicken were essentially from the gods themselves\".   I went here for the first time with a very large group (11 people) on a Sunday night and there was no wait, which was great! The ambiance is incredible, having both inside and outside seating (part of which is covered so you will not be basking in the sun). Our waitress was very accommodating and extremely knowledgeable and helpful. It is not too loud or quite, and you can either make it a fancy date night or a casual dinner with friends.   Thier drink menu is semi-expensive, consisting of mostly very fancy cocktails. However, I ordered a simple bloody mary and was NOT disappointed (the mix was similar to Zing-Zang).   For food, I ordered two chicken fingers (with multiple sauces) and the kale salad side. I really enjoy that they give you the option to order your chicken fingers individually (similar to what other yelpers have written). However, I wasn't head-over-heels, absolutely in love with them. To be honest, they were good (clearly better than fast-food chicken fingers), but not great, I wasn't really IN LOVE with them, like other yelpers have made it seem. The kale salad was really good as well (it came with goat cheese and oranges on top, which complemented the other flavors very nicely). I tried the tater tots as well and those were also good. I had a bite of the mac-and-cheese and it was extremely creamy and cheesy.   My biggest cons with Haberdash (and why I gave it a 3/5) would be that the menu is not that diverse in terms of light versus heavy dishes, and that the price point is just way too expensive for the amount/quality.   Like I said in the very beginning, I am not the biggest fan of 'southern food', but I do enjoy having fattening, creamy, what-your-southern-grandma-would-make food once in a while. I may have ordered different and more sides/appetizers if there were more options to complement all of the VERY heavy options. Second, the price point is annoying in itself. Everything is a la carte (which really bugs me when I have to pay extra for sides). The small kale salad was 7 dollars (see in picture) and I wish I had either gotten more or would have cost less. I think a lot of people end up getting the chicken fingers simply because they are the only thing on the menu that is appropriate for the price.  All of the other food that our table order looked and tasted delicious as well (I had a few bite of other random sides). I do not doubt that people will keep going here, I just think there are better options for your money out in downtown NODA or throughout Charlotte.   I would suggest giving this place a try if you haven't. Either you will be like the majority of reviews and absolutely love this place. Or you will be like me, where you aren't exactly disappointed, you just aren't WOW-ed by it. I am glad I went here, but I do not think I will be returning unless it is for a birthday party or group dinner.",

My friend tried their chicken tenders with a side waffle and loved it! Two tenders and a waffle filled her up plenty. Everything on the menu is meant to be ordered a la carte.

The fried chicken ( dark meat )was amazing and I love the crust that the cook made, and that crunch took my breath away. The sides , Mac and cheese and collard greens where actually mediocre. I give it a pass because I'm used to home cooked version of both and shall not hold it to the same standard.   Pros  - Polite staff  - Amazing drinks  - Super diverse and inclusive crowd - Quick food and drink turn over times  - Lovely atmosphere   Cons - A long wait at times  - Tricky NODA parking  - Meh sides   Pro Tip - Use the yelp app to get a place in line early, before you come.  - If your dining for two, order the full bird instead of two half's , save a little money",

I ordered the dark meat chicken and the Mac n cheese while my fiance also got the Mac n cheese with the skins on top.   The chicken was great, but the Mac n cheese was a disappointment. Mine at least was slightly cold on the inside and had a powdery texture to the sauce. But besides that it just wasn't good. My fiance also made the same comments about his order.",

Crunchy and juicy chicken with delicious Alabama white sauce, fluffy biscuit with flavorful jam, and tangy sweet carrots!   The waffle, sweet potato dumplings, and bloody mary were disappointing. Waffle was small for $4 and not fluffy like the biscuit. Sweet potato dumplings were shockingly bland, and bloody Mary was not strong at all, get a beer.   Service was good, location is great, and atmosphere is very cool. Price point was a lot more than I expected to spend, can't afford to come too often.",

About the only thing I didn't like at the restaurant was the chicken skin topping for the mac and cheese.  We arrived here starved and got a whole smoked chicken, fried chicken fingers, a salad, a pickle and more.   I like the house made ranch - that is really good.   They dump a sauce all over the smoked chicken - which was really great and had us mopping up the plate - but if you are a picky eater you may want to ask for the sauce on the side!",

Both cocktails I had were delicious. I ordered a couple chicken fingers and the deviled eggs to snack on. The chicken fingers were hot and crispy, and the dipping sauces were very tasty. They sell the chicken fingers as singles which I liked, I ordered 2 and they were very big, I couldn't finish them. I also ordered the deviled eggs, and I topped them with the local trout as was recommended by my bartender. I lovvveeeee deviled eggs, but unfortunately these just didn't do it for me. I want to blame it on the trout but I think that overall the deviled eggs just didn't have much flavor. I would definitely go back for cocktails and chicken when in town- Haberdish was the most frequently recommended restaurant when I was in Charlotte so I'm interested in the other food on the menu as well!",

We order the fried chicken, tater tots, sweet potato dumplings, purple cabbage and collards. Loved the cabbage, the tots and dumplings weren't the best I've ever had but still tasty.

We shared the biscuits and bacon jam and woah was it filling. The biscuit tho was a tad dry/hard. We also snuck a hashpuppy off a friends plate and it was really good. Better then any hush puppy Iv had in the past. In fact I used to say I didn't like them but after this one I guess I can't say that anymore!  Def looking forward to coming back and trying some of that fried chicken everyone talks about and sampling a few more drinks off the cocktail menu!!",

We were pleasantly surprised how much we loved our meal.  We started with the deviled eggs w/smoked trout...sounds a bit odd but really the best deviled egg I've ever eaten.  Moving on we tried the daily special Arranchinni.  Wow!  This was my favorite bite of the evening.  Our meal finished out with some of the best fried chicken, red cabbage and Mac n Cheese.  Our least favorite was the Mac n Cheese, but that's not to say it wasn't tastey.  Super friendly staff and great suggestions from our server.  Loved the vibe and ambiance here.  A little on the loud side, but still enjoyable.   Oh I'd be amiss if I didn't mention the awesome glassware and plates we were served on.  Definitely lived our meal, which was served family style, by the way.  For the quality and taste, the total check was very reasonable too!  Give them a try!!",

Chic and very fitting for the upscale soul food vibe. The place was hopping on a Saturday night and the noise level is a bit loud but definitely tolerable.  Food is designed to be family style which we really didn't abide by. I don't like sharing ha. I had the 1/2 chicken and Mac and cheese. It was immediately noticeable that the pasta in the Mac and cheese is freshly made. It was perfect! My chicken was delicious until I got to my chicken breast which had some raw batter inside. I kindly let the staff know and they fixed it and were very courteous.  Overall a decent place for upscale soul food and a good place for large groups. Make sure you check in on the waitlist before you head down there!",

The second cocktail was so pretty I almost didn't even want to drink it. The fried chicken is always tasty and the mac'n'cheese is awesome. I was not a fan of the fried okra, it literally was mush. The carrots were delicious and would definitely order it again.   I have said it once and I will say it again, the bar tenders are not friendly, at all..that really needs to change.

Not sure why my taste buds won't allow them to be my favorite spot, but nevertheless, if you enjoy or you think you enjoy Southern style food, then this place is the way to go!  I came here this past Sunday for an early lunch with my BF. I ordered their Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potato Dumplings, and my bf ordered fried chicken. I wanted to order their tater tots, but they ran out?! (at 11:30 AM?!) So, I made a random and quick decision and ordered the deviled eggs - I don't like deviled eggs, I don't know why I did this. Anyways, both the sweet potato dumplings & mac/cheese were great. My bf enjoyed his fried chicken as well. I did not like the deviled eggs at all, as expected. While I won't be back, I would definitely recommend to others because the place was packed within an hour of us being seated!",

    "text": "This great experience began by using Yelp's newer waitlist function. The restaurant had almost a 90 minute wait and I was able to waitlist at home then show up just in time to order cocktails at the bar and be seated shortly after.   This southern style inspired restaurant did an excellent job on the food. From the fried chicken, mac n' cheese, pickles, hush puppies, and more, nothing was amiss.  The beverage menu is extensive with beers, wines, and cocktails. I particularly liked how the cocktails are laid out by style. The bar tenders were friendly and attentive.   The atmosphere is original and warm. I felt very comfortable.   So, why the missing star? Clearly the wait staff is overworked here. Our waitress had way too many tables to truly offer the service she was capable of (as determined by the great interactions we had with her). The biggest miss was when I couldn't get anyone's attention, got up myself to the bussing station and got plates for my group before our served food got cold. Rather than be embarrassed, she seemed a little annoyed I had done this, but who wants room temperature fried chicken!?  I'd definitely go back, hands down.",

I've had better southern dishes, esp. mac n cheese, fried chicken, etc. But again, nothing was bad but just not memorable.  Price point also felt a bit high for what it was but I know the decor and drinks were more upscale. The food just wasnt. Get there early and get your name on the list.

We ordered the hash browns, livermush toast, two 1/2 chickens, sweet potato dumplings, Mac and cheese with chicken skin, and the banana pudding.  First off, we did not receive the livermush toast, one 1/2 chicken, nor the banana pudding because the waitress \"forgot to put in our order\".   Secondly, my husband tried to order a grey goose with tonic and our waitress \"didn't know if the bar had grey goose\" and kept insisting that we order something off the cocktail menu instead (clearly because she was too lazy to go check). Honestly, what  waitress doesn't know if they have grey goose vodka or not?! You shouldn't be a waitress if you don't know what's behind the bar.   This was the kicker, forty five minutes into our dinner, I didn't have one drink at the establishment yet. I asked if I could place a drink order. She said, \"Some of you are \"slurring\" your words and I don't feel comfortable serving you.\" Excuse me?! I'm Asian, enough said. This is what set me off.   Oh and top of that, she muttered, \"Maybe after you all have filled your bellies I'll consider serving you a drink.\" Insinuating we were wasted. Wow. Just wow. I'm sorry, but our table of four ordered a total of two drinks the entire time we were there, were more sober than 99% of the restaurant, and was just having a good time with each other cutting up. It was embarrassing and no one should ever be treated like that.   Worst experience at an establishment ever. I am definitely not the one to want a free meal, but when we complained to the manager he made zero effort to make things right. I have never been more offended in my life. Bad service, bad management and bad sweet potato dumplings (which I don't think was actually sweet potato dumplings). Who knows what our waitress brought us.",

Drinks were good start while we play word search and tic toe with kids mon menu.  Sat on patio on a hot day and it didn't feel to bad.  A misting system would make the patio better in the scorching temps. Kids food came well in advance of the adults food which is a good thing but it's hard to resist tasting their chicken fingers and it was out of this world good!! They brought my daughter and son lemon for their chicken and when my daughter wanted Mac N cheese as a side they accommodated no problem. Ok. But too long between adult meals and kids.  More than 15 minutes and counting......patience is a virtue. Ok. Quality of food redeem this place!! Everyone is loving their food from the fried chicken to the smoke chicken with the white sauce and the ribs. Sweet potato dumplings were also very tasty.",

    "text": "My husband and I have eaten at Haberdish a few times now, and really like their food.  But just be prepared for a wait, even if you visit during a non-busy time.  Their deviled eggs are delicious - very creamy, and filled to overflowing.  We've tried their fried chicken, fried cauliflower, and cast iron trout as our entrees.  Their chicken is very crispy and tender inside.  And the chicken pieces are quite large, too.  At $9.50 for a two piece white meal (without sides, as those are extra), I feel it's a great value.  Their cauliflower is an interesting concept.  I think it's a great option for a vegetarian, but I'm not sure we'd get it again, as their other options are just too good to pass up.  The cast iron trout is more than double the price of the chicken, but it was melt-in-your mouth delicious.  That could have been from the loads of butter they cooked it in, but it tasted fantastic and was not too salty, as some others have pointed out.  I didn't eat the skin, however.  Their sides are also good.  We've had their purple cabbage and collards, and both were decently shareable portions.    It does take some time to get drinks from the bar, as well as your food.  So just sit back, relax, and wait for a treat.  We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was spending the weekend in Charlotte and while doing my \"foodie research\" decided I needed to go to Charlotte's best restaurant of 2017, which is Haberdish. I know, I know we are in 2019 but still they must be doing something right... =]   A cool bar  located in newly gentrified Noda district this restaurant caters to young, trendy and chic crowds by offering amazing cocktails, many wines and beers. Once you walk inside you can't miss the metal chairs, and bare wood tables with just enough edge to make the space feel trendy without becoming pretencious. The name \"Haberdish\" was also inspired by the word \"haberdashery,\" in keeping with Charlotte's textile mill history.  Fried chicken and Mac and cheese with crispy chicken crumbs aren't just a must order--you can't leave Charlotte without a taste.   Enough said, lets move on to the good part...the food!  Let's be honest you come here for the chicken, Brined, battered, and fried, the chicken at Haberdish can be ordered half, whole, or in two-piece white or dark meat options. They also offer chicken tenders if you're not ready to commit to something bigger. Crisp and brown on the outside their chicken is just made to perfection.  From house pickles to smoked deviled eggs and sweet potato dumplings, the appetizers make for the perfect bite every time. I also highly recommend the mac & cheese, fried chicken and the smoked chicken (delicious white sauce)  From a well-thought-out theme that carries over from the food and cocktails to the decor, Haberdish is absolutely a must go in Charlotte",

The chicken is good, but it's all the other stuff that makes this place awesome - the sides, the appetizers (I was obsessed with the seasonal pickles), the drinks, and the desserts. Service was typically really great, and I found the prices to be excellent value considering the quality of the food, drinks, service, and surroundings. Last time I visited the woman working behind the bar found out I was in town for work and went out of her way to give me a bunch of great recommendations for local food and entertainment.",

We started with the drinks Honeybee and the Mint Julep which were both really good. The Honeybee is a bit pricey and doesn't actually come with a piece of the flower that gives it the special tingle but it was still a good one-time experience.   We ordered an app of hush puppies, a whole fried chicken, sides of mac and cheese, and savory corn bread pudding. Everything was excellent. The fried chicken was some of the best in town. If I was to critique any of the food I could only say the mac and cheese was really good but nothing fantastic and the corn bread pudding was great but I would have preferred it to be a little more juicy or have a drizzle of some melted cheese or sauce. Grilling the corn bread pudding on the flat top dries it out and with no sauce it looses its \"bread pudding\" title.   Regardless of the little details, I loved the trip and I will definitely be back.",

They don't take reservations so get there at a decent time because the line can get long. Everything from Haberdish is locally grown, even their chicken! For brunch (at the time) they offer a limited menu. The most breakfasty item they had was chicken and waffles. Probably the best I have ever had. The waffles have little pearl sugar in them which create a sweater waffle. Their honey butter syrup is to die for too, honestly goes so well over the chicken. Their sides are family style and I 10/10 recommend the mac & cheese. I had also tried their Blonde Bloody Mary, which is cathead vodka, yellow tomato Bloody Mary mix, lime, and olives. I personally wasn't a huge fan of this because I am really into spicy Bloody Mary's and this was on the sweeter side with an odd after taste. Next time I would like to go for dinner and I hear that they have a bigger variety of a brunch menu.",

Contemporary industrial(ish) without feeling contrived or \"me too\".  Our server was quick to greet us and always tended to our table - she was sweet and helpful but not overly sugary.  We got there about 545P (on a Tues) and were seated right away.  There were only a handful of tables occupied then, but within about 30mins, the place was packed.   We got hushpuppies for an app and the chicken-fried cauliflower steaks for dinner with sides of savory bread pudding and mac & cheese as sides to share.  We got a double order of m&c and it was a huuuge plate's worth!  Could've easily done the single order and would have been plenty, but we had lots of leftovers to take home.  Everything we had was phenomenal and had a hard time picking a favorite dish.  We were so impressed with the meal that we ordered the chocolate sheet cake (not a whole one...) for dessert and it did not disappoint.  Prices are more than reasonable, especially considering the high quality of the food and great service, and the portions are extremely generous.  We arrived very hungry and left stuffed (with more than half our meals in to-go bags too!).  Needless to say, we loved it and will definitely be back.  What a great addition to Noda and the Charlotte culinary scene.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the vibe and decor of Haberdish. I would say that their menu does lack a little variety as far as entrees go. I split a few dishes with a friend of mine and we didn't try the fried chicken (probably should have based on the fact that that's what everyone said is the best). We had the pickles, one of their salads (which was pretty large as a starter). We opted for the \"healthier\" chicken option which was roasted and it was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed everything that we ate.  Their service was a little wonky, and that could be because they are still fairly new. If you order a cocktail, the bartender will bring it to your table. You have a server, but you may see a few faces as your plates come out. There was some confusion surrounding the wine that we ordered. It finally got squared away by the time our entree was already out.  Despite the slightly unorganized serving style, we really enjoyed are time here. I'll definitely be back!",

He loves chicken and waffle, and we heard this place was famous for it, so we gave it a try. Because they had a small menu, I just ended up getting a kale salad, and it was so delicious! (I rarely say that kale about salads!) They didn't have \"chicken and waffles\" on the menu, but our server was kind enough to get that order for my boyfriend. His dark meat chicken was very tender and juicy. The waffle was so good that he had to order another one. We also ordered hush puppies (not pictured because we devoured it so quickly) and it was probably the best hush puppies I've ever had. In addition to the good food, service was really good and our server was always attentive. We will definitely be returning.   On a side note, my only complaint is that their menu isn't extensive enough. :(",

I have not tried a drink yet but their list is very extensive and lots of variety.  The staff has a long way to go in being comfortable with the menu - they were very hesitant and couldn't make the best recommendations - understandable considering they opened a little over a month ago.

One reviewed below hit it spot on.. someone has a super heavy hand with garlic salt on the mac and cheese, that's literally all you can taste. Kale salad is tiny for $7, okra was oily and bland. Service is also pretty apathetic, no water refills, dishes left on the table even after we paid the check.",

I decided to try a bookmarked restaurant and made an online order as I found close parking.  The order took about 15-20 mins.  The restaurant was warm and cozy.  The room was dim with romantic lighting perfect for a date.  Seating and bar was spaced appropriately.  I got some of the most favorite picks: Alabama brin chicken, Mac n cheese, and sweet potato dumpling (curious based on the name & topping). The takeout separated well and compacted neatly.  Everything was good and like another reviewer I oddly felt the dumplings could have came with a syrup in the side.  Seems a sweet topping could have fit in.  The chicken has be fired in bacon fat judging from the smell and taste.  It was good and fulfilling (non greasiness).  Mac and cheese was superb.  I was waited on upon visiting the bar and wish well on the way out by two different employees.  Always a good thing.  One bartender was snarky when I sat at the bar for my finished order.  I told her I had been helped by her colleague behind her but we'll look over her.  Glad to recommend and return.",

The deviled eggs were only five bucks, a little on the salty side but never the less worth it. Overall would definitely come back and try the other entrees although the food menu was limited they still had a pretty good selection. Big win for their drink menu. I had a champagne punch that was refreshing and surprisingly not too sweet, definitely would come back for drinks, great spot to grab drinks, meet up with friends, group settings with outside seating and indoor.",

Anything from the punch and refreshers column should serve you well.  SO the smoked chicken was dry and nothing of it tasted \"smoked\". More like \"baked\" and it was a huge plate of chicken, l must say. As l looked around, l noticed most people just had piles of chicken tenders on their plate. I see l made a mistake. The deviled eggs were delicious. I added smoked trout. Yum. The mac and cheese is a good concept, but it really has no flavor. You have to add the chicken skins with hot sauce and then it gets a little better. The second time l went- eggs not so good. I tried the tenders- over priced an overrated. Twice is enough for me at this place, but l would definitely suggest giving it a try. It is eclectic and different. It is small and they seat you pretty close to other people.",

Dinner consisted of hush puppies (appetizer), two pieces of friend chicken with fried okra and kale grits on the side, and the lemon tart (dessert). The hush puppies were delicious, but I think it's probably hard to screw that up. My favorite part was the fried chicken. Two good sized pieces (a breast and a wing) that were so SO good. Not too much breading, thick, and juicy - full of flavor. The fried okra was also a show-stopper. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale grits, but I have a bias against kale for no good reason! I'm not usually a big dessert person, but the lemon tart was great.  The service was not inattentive, but was slower than I would have liked, hence the four stars. We ended up spending close to two hours! Overall a great experience though.",

I would describe it as southern chic; I also love the outdoor patio area.  We ordered hushpuppies to start, and they were so good. They were really crispy on the outside and really soft on the inside. They're made with a different dough than typical hush puppies, and they were delicious. The tea butter was unique and added great flavor.  For dinner, I ordered 2 chicken fingers (you can order them a la carte!) and my fiance and I shared two sides -- the okra and kale grits. My chicken tenders were excellent -- juicy and crispy at the same time. The kale grits were fabulous and made me feel like I was eating something healthy. The grits has great consistency - not rubbery but not soupy.   For dessert, we tried the lemon tart and the buttermilk icecream. Both were excellent -- great flavor! The buttermilk ice cream was definitely unique, but I liked it.  I will definitely be back!",

I expected a lot more given the hype around this place. The food was good (just good) which is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. The other 3 stars are missing due completely to front of house issues I experienced during my visit. I served throughout college and am pretty patient, but frankly the service flat out sucked. Like really sucked.   We started by grabbing a drink from the bar while waiting for our friends. The girl that helped us was a snarky and condescending. It was pretty obvious she didnt really want to be there.  If you go to their bar, try and get the male bartender with the long hair as he's much nicer and friendlier.  At the table, our waitress was just a mess.  It was Sunday night and the restaurant was well staffed, and yet our waitress was seemingly too busy to stand by our table for more than 5 seconds. As a consequence we never got her name. After our appetizer we sat at the table for 15+ minutes before she came back to take our order, and she had to come back by and ask us again what it was because she'd forgotten parts of it. (Maybe she should have written it down?)  As the food came out, she was nowhere in sight. The foodrunners (or other servers?) ran our food out and we were  missing an item.  We just figured she didnt put it in and were going to let it go, but she came back to the table after we'd asked for our bills and noticed we hadnt gotten some of our food. Aka this item died in the window. She would probably have known if she ran any of the food or came by at all.   Foodwise...  Biscuits with bacon jam were very meh.  Never thought I'd say this, but it was too much bacon and not enough biscuit.   Fried chicken was okay. Pretty juicy but heavily breaded and a bit saltier than I prefer. Decently spiced. All-around, just alright.   Sides were the best part of the meal. Cornbread pudding, okra, and cheesy grits were all very flavorful and textually pleasant. The okra was not over or undercooked, and had some firmness to it. The cornbread pudding was very nice- rich, decadent, and a bit sweet.   Despite haberdish's played out concept, the restaurant manages to have some level of uniqueness and identity. One that I actually liked.  The food was alright and the ambiance was nice, but the service was terrible. Overall, I'd go once more to try it again if the service hadn't been such garbage. But it was. So I probably won't be back.",

We entered and a woman with very short curly hair just says \"How many?\" Whatever happened to 'hello' or 'how are you today?' We sit down and our waiter was ok at first but when it came time to get our food he was gone and some other guy literally just brought it to the table and dropped it down. Never said a word. The tables near us that came much later than us had their food already and we were just a table of two.  The guy that plopped our food on the table was taller w a red and black plaid shirt and dark hair. Just rude.  We ate and then sat there waiting for whatever server might show this time, then plaid guy showed up again after we called him over. . We told him we haven't seen our waiter and thought he may have gone home and that we needed takeout containers.  We had four sides and they only gave us two small round containers and one small container for the chicken and we had to ask for more containers and a bigger chicken box. So who showed up for that container drop off but our original waiter that was MIA before. So we walk out with all the lose containers balancing in our hands (because they didn't give us a bag) and then we walk out near the same female that was supposedly the greeter that was there when we walked in and she never said a word. She saw us w all the containers and didn't offer up a bag or say \"Have a good day.\"  Because of their lousy service and basically no real adults out front teaching staff how to treat customers (especially in the South, where people are supposedly known for their friendliness) we won't be back. Somebody at the top is dropping the ball with staff training about these important details and how to be more accommodating and just plain friendly in general. Unfortunate.",

    "text": "I really liked this new NODA spot!  It's not very big inside, but it has a beautiful layout and bar area, which i'm told is inspired by it's textile mill heritage. Good spot for dinner or to have some hand made cocktails and small plates!   The menu is fairly simple and not very expensive compared to the atmosphere it displays.  Two of us shared the half chicken, two starters and two sides and one beer for less than $30.    On to the food!  4/5 of the food items we ordered were delicious!  We got the pimento cheese ball, which comes like a standard cheese ball, covered with toasted spiced Pecans.  The special crackers they serve with it, makes for a delicious combination.  We also ordered the smoked deviled eggs, which were very solid.  For our entree we split the half chicken (two decent sized breasts, one leg and one wing)  the skin on this chicken was some of the best i've ever had! We ordered the mac and cheese as a side.  It was white cheddar mac and it was delicious.  You can order it with crumbled fried chicken skin on top, which i highly recommend!    The one thing we didn't like was the Sweet Potato Dumplings.  I was really excited for them, but the taste didn't do it for me or my wife.  Maybe it was a bad batch, but the waitress was kind enough to take it off.",

Very nice ambience and it appears that they know how to make cocktails as they had a wide variety of bitters and other accoutrements for cocktail makings.  This night however, I ordered a pale ale from their beer menu.  My order consisted of a hushpuppy starter which is served with a \"sweet tea\" butter.  Interesting mild flavor.  Nice.  My main was a 1/2 fried chicken which I was told they are known for.  It was good.  It's fried chicken but it hit the spot and was very reasonably priced.  As a side a had a collard greens special.  Tasty and went well with the fried chicken and as a follow on the hush puppies.     All in all, a nice place, with good atmosphere, food, beer or drinks.  Worthy of a return visit.  :)",

The interior is well decorated, clean, and the staff has always been super nice and welcoming. This place is very popular so the wait can get a little long but there is so much to see around the neighborhood that the time will fly if you explore a bit while you wait. Their fried chicken is cooked and seasoned to perfection while always being super juicy. The Mac n Cheese with crispy chicken skins is a must have. The fried okra is amazing and it's truly hard to cook well without it being slimy but Haberdish does it very well. The banana pudding is extremely good but needs a bit more cookies in it ( I personally like a lot of vanilla wafers in mine but to each their own). The bar also are on point with their drinks and never skimp on the booze. All in all a definite A+.",

    "text": "Holy moly. I stopped in here for lunch on a whim last weekend. What a treat!  It wasn't crowded at all at 3 pm on a Saturday. I was by myself so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered their fried cauliflower with a side of charred okra and sweet potato dumplings. I also ordered some cheese straws to start.   The cheese straws were good -- kind of hard to mess those up -- but not anything I'd just have to have again. I liked the presentation: served standing up in a mason jar.   The sides were delicious. The okra came kind of tossed with bacon jam which added a nice depth of flavor. It was charred just right and the okra had a perfect texture. The sweet potato dumplings were not at all like I had envisions but they were delicious, nonetheless.   The cauliflower though. My god, THE CAULIFLOWER! First off, I am fairly sure I got an entire head of cauliflower. It was huge! Second off, the textures and flavors were perfect. The sides complemented it nicely but I'd have been satisfied with the cauliflower alone.   Everyone I interacted with was really friendly. I liked the overall vibe but it could feel entirely different at a busier time.   As for pricing, I got out of there for under $40 including tip. This is more than reasonable when you consider I had enough leftovers for dinner that night and lunch the next day. It could be a really nice place for an in-between date night: not too dive-y but not too uppity either. Assuming the portion sizes are consistent across their menu, you could easily split an entree and some sides, then splurge on one of their amazing sounding cocktails or desserts.   I'm glad I finally got to try the place. I look forward to going back for a date night, or girls' night, and trying some more of what they have to offer.",

    "text": "Decided to try Haberdish last and wasn't disappointed. A lot of restaurants that try to add a twist on southern food miss the mark but for the most part Haberdish succeeded.   It's tucked away in NoDa and offers a great cozy atmosphere and a craft cocktail bar.  We ordered the fried chicken and roast chicken for our entrees. Everyone agreed that the fried chicken hit the rare combination between crispy-crunchy skin outside and moist juicy meat inside. The skin's flavor was okay--decently seasoned but could stand improvement. The roast chicken was equally moist with a tasty white sauce drizzled over it.  One area Haberdish could improve on would be the side dish department. The side selection is small and none really stand out. Our group ordered the kale grits, charred okra, and mac and cheese with spicy chicken skins on top. The kale \"grits\" were good but I wouldn't call them grits per se. The charred okra was good. Our group all believes that if mac and cheese isn't baked it's not real mac and cheese. This mac and cheese was the creamy stove top cooks version so it wasn't our favorite but the spicy chicken skins on top were delicious and I think Haberdish would do well serving a spicy version of their fried chicken entree.  All in all I think Haberdish was a good experience and I would recommend it to people for a good relatively inexpensive night out in NoDa. If you're looking for authentic soul/southern food you'll be disappointed but if you're looking for comfort food with a twist you'll leave happy.",

She provided suggestions for the rest of our day, all of which were great. Thanks Ali!",

We started out with the biscuits and bacon jam which was pretty good, but the real treat came when our main entrees arrived. We got the smoked chicken, a few chicken tenders, mac & cheese with chicken skins, sweet potato dumplings and the slaw. The smoked chicken had an amazing Alabama sauce covering it that paired really well with the smoked chicken flavor but didn't overpower it. For dessert we had the waffle. They were out of the buttermilk ice cream so we substituted the daily special peach ice cream and that worked pretty well. I honestly tried to pick out my favorite portion of the meal and I can't do it. No matter what we had it was all very good, and I can't wait to go back and try even more!",

I remember walking past the space for years wondering when someone would do something with it and man have they blown it out of the water. The food was incredible as well, we ordered a bunch of things to try and taste as much as we could and we loved everything. The Trout was insanely good and so was the fried chicken. NoDa and Charlotte are blessed to have this gem.",

As my meal, I got the chicken and waffles (white meat) and the sweet potatoes. Both were delicious - the skin on the chicken was my favorite part and the homemade hot sauce was a close second. Got the Love Potion cocktail - also delicious. Pro tip: ask for a flower in your ice cube! Will definitely be back for more fried chicken :-)  *only complaint is the parking in Noda is always a nightmare",

When we walked in I quickly realized that there was no A/C. I had requested inside because it was close to 90 degrees outside. We had drinks at the bar and the service was great! We were seated in the back part of the restaurant. There was absolutely no breeze or fan. It was very warm. When we ordered, we found that they were out of okra, ribs, and a few other things. Our food was good, but the temperature made the experience difficult to enjoy. We ate quickly, so we could get outside for some get relief. There was no mention that the A/C broken, so I don't know what the issue was. It was a bummer for sure!",

Seems like you can't go wrong with the sides, but **do not even think about skipping the mac n cheese with crispy fried chicken skin**.  Maybe I'll have it for dinner next time.

    "text": "Best dish in NODA.  The smoked chicken with the Alabama white sauce is absolutely wonderful.  Every last bite was amazing.  The chicken is perfectly smoked, the white sauce, a blend of creamy, tangy and magic, compliments the chicken so well.  They hand make their tater tots to give you an idea of how good their sides are.  The cauliflower steak is my favorite vegetarian dish in the city.  The cocktails are inventive and play off the menu really well too.  The prices are lower than expected for what you get.  What they do they do really well.    The only knock on the place is the small menu.  After coming in a handful of times I feel like I've tried everything (but I still want the smoked chicken anyway).  The outdoor seating is nice and should make the wait times better in the warmer months than the colder.  If they expand the menu or change it up once in a while it would be a five star place.      This is another offering from the owner of Growlers and Crepe Cellar down the street.  All of them are doing it right.  ***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***",

The restaurant itself has great aesthetic - cute little place with brick walls, thick wooden tables, and their food comes out on wonderful old time, country china. It's definitely an instagram worthy locale, so I give them credit for that. I am glad we went, I believe we went for my birthday and at the time, I wasn't vegetarian yet, so we tried a little of everything - veggies, deviled eggs, and fried chicken. All the food was good, there just hasn't been a draw for me that I feel like I have to go go back. I don't really have a rhyme or a reason, just haven't been as obsessed with it as everyone else seems to be.   Like I said, no negative thoughts and a place worth visiting but just never got the hype. Definitely give them a visit if you haven't yet.",

    "text": "I have wanted to try Haberdish since they opened, and we finally made it about a month ago. My expectations were high, given the great Yelp! photos and reviews.   Unfortunately, we did not have a good dining experience. Since that night, I have contemplated whether or not to write this review. I so wanted Haberdish to be great, but it wasn't. The manager and our server tried to make it right, so I was torn about posting a less than favorable review. But I think an honest review, especially knowing that we plan to try them again some other time is fair.   So here it is...  Smoked trout deviled eggs: FANTASTIC! We started with the deviled eggs and thought we were in for a good night. From there things went downhill.   Hightop chairs: This is minor. Butt...(pun intended) the hostess asked if a hightop would be ok. We agreed. The hightop chairs are metal and not for the ample-bottomed. After spending our first 15 minutes sliding out of our seats, we asked to be moved to a regular table.   Sweet potato dumplings: The sweet potato dumplings were tough, bland, and only had a sweet potato aftertaste. Queue the condescension. The manager explained that the dumplings were \"more like gnocchi\" and went on the try and explain the difference. I know the difference.   Charred okra: Charred but soggy. Not at all what we expected based on the menu's description. We couldn't appreciate the over-sized stalks of whole okra soaked in bacon jam. We exchanged it for the mac and cheese.   Mac and cheese: Meh.   Fried chicken:  I ordered the quarter dark. The chicken looked scrumptious. Building up to this point, I was waiting to get our sides straightened out, so I could bite into my chicken. I pulled the leg from the thigh and a drop of blood (not juice, bright red blood) hit my plate. The chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. I sent it back.   At that point, we asked to speak to the manager. We recapped the night and shared our disappointment. That's when the manager offered apologies and explanations. Again, he really did try to make it right. I won't go into the details, but we were pleased with how he resolved the situation.   In the end we chalked it up to a bad night and agreed to come back another time.",

Went home with half a chicken breast and half the Mac.   However, this is one of the places where they definitely take advantage of \"younger\" customers. We are both 18, and watched our waitress check up on the tables on either side of us multiple times while we sat there with empty waters. And she kind of scoffed at my date when he said excuse me and asked for a refill....?? Although the service wasn't that bad- she checked up on both sides of us a few times and just over looked us.

I've had the White Chai and the Wrong Place/Right Time, and both were incredibly unique and memorable drinks.   As for the food, it's contemporary Southern-style with fried chicken and a variety of delicious sides. My favorites include the chicken tenders (which you can order by the individual tender), the sweet potato dumplings, charred okra with bacon jam, and the tater tots. I've also had the waffles and the biscuits, which are very good as well. My absolute favorite item is the hushpuppies - I'm not usually a fan, but these are amazing! The sweet tea butter that accompanies them really elevates the entire dish. The only thing I have tried that I wasn't too wild about was the cauliflower steak - while the dish is a fun idea, it is a little too smoky in flavor for me.   I've had excellent experiences both at brunch and at dinner, and I'll definitely be back!",

Although they have a smaller menu, they do everything on it well and I always find myself recommending them to out of towners. My favorites are the fried chicken tenders, Mac and cheese, sweet potato dumplings, corn pudding, hush puppies and okra (ok, everything on the menu!). The cocktails are amazing, seasonal and innovative and their daily specials add some variety. Highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't been! It's my favorite restaurant in CLT",

    "text": "Friends and I visited Haberdish for a birthday celebration and I'll be honest... being 99.9% vegetarian made me nervous about ordering off the menu. The food is served family style and it's highly southern meaning that it's just about all meat everything! I definitely felt like I was taking one for the team. However, it worked out really well and I enjoyed my time here.   First, the place is beautiful! There is a ton of natural light, big windows and a patio, the whole shebang.  It was very modern farmhouse and my group was lucky enough to get seated at a giant family style farm table. We all gathered around and got lost in their drink menu. While I wasn't drinking during the visit, I did try a few of my friend's cocktails. I can't remember the names of them but they were all divine. I know one had jalapeno and cilantro in it and it was super refreshing and unique. I almost said screw it and got one but it never ended up happening.   I ended up deciding to just order on my own, separate from group. I choose the kale salad, which included orange slices, goat cheese, and candied sesame with a pomegranate molasses dressing.  It was fantastic and I was left wanting more. It was fresh, had some crunch, and it wasn't too sweet. I would recommend it to anybody. The group got a few sides that I tried a bite of. I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato dumplings, simply too heavy for me. The tater tots were fantastic! A good tot might not sound like a lot to ask for but I'll tell you, it can be hard to find sometimes. The bbq glazed carrots were definitely a standout! They were cooked well and the flavor was spot on. Don't skip these puppies!  To celebrate my friend's birthday, she was treated to some ice cream and we all got a few bites. It was very thick and creamy and almost tasted like cheesecake. We were all really impressed. All in all, this place is dope. If I lived near by I would imagine coming here for drinks on the patio and definitely for brunch. You should come, there's no doubt about it.",

For appetizers, we ordered the smoked deviled eggs and both agreed they had too much vinegar for our liking. The hushpuppies with sweet tea butter were fantastic. For entrees, my wife ordered the the two piece white fried chicken while I ordered the chicken tenders. Her chicken was good & moist, but my tenders were overcooked and very dry. The sweet potato dumplings were bland and heavy, while the mac n cheese was lacking in taste. I was hoping the banana pudding would save the day as it is my favorite dessert. Alas, it was not very good. Both of us thought the whipped topping was very salty. I mentioned it to our server, who investigated and removed it from our bill.   We were hoping this would be a place to take friends, but I don't think it is worthy of a second chance. It's too bad as I had really high hopes.",

The service wasn't the best (our initial server inexplicably didn't return even though she was still on shift, food arrived and we didn't have utensils, extra condiments never arrived etc) and the kitchen was out of the only vegetarian meal on the menu at lunch time. We got a few side dishes to share which were mostly very good - the hushpuppies, savory bread pudding, and mac&cheese were great. The tots were good but a bit too oily, which sounds like the fryer oil wasn't hot enough and they got saturated. The cocktail I got was very good and they didn't skimp on the alcohol, though it was just a bit overpriced. I will definitely return, though I may call ahead to see if the cauliflower entree is available!",

The patio would have been perfect if the seats weren't stained and food wiped from the table to the ground where the debris stayed.  The service was fine at first but after my appetizer was delivered, I never saw my server again.  I ordered hushpuppies for an appetizer and they were disappointing.  They were made to order but barely warm, dry and bland.  I waited for more than 20 minutes for my server and had to get someone else's attention for assistance.  I placed an order on tater tots and white meat fried chicken, I asked that onions, chives and shallots be excluded.  The entree arrived with chives all over the chicken and I had to send it back.  My original server returned to table to find out what went wrong and I responded.  The server left and returned to say that the person who took my order thought I didn't want onions, chives or shallots on the tots only.    I received another entree without onions, chives or shallots.  I asked if the meal would be discounted because of the wait and mix up.  I ate the tots which would have been perfect with less ground black pepper on them.  The chicken is brined than fried to make it moist and flavorful.  The chicken had a faint odor that I could not identify but just thought it was the brine.  I ate a little but stopped and concentrated on the tots instead because the taste was off-putting.  I boxed the remaining hushpuppies and chicken.  Although the server removed the chicken for the bill; a few hours later, my stomach began to ache.    The ambiance at Haberdish is inviting but the food doesn't come close to being decent.  I will not be returning to Haberdish.",

    "text": "Probably a 4.5 star (if Yelp let me give half stars). The meal was amazing. My husband and I nearly sampled a little bit of everything and then had leftovers for days.   Smoked Deviled eggs: Delicious. There wasn't too much smoke and just had all around great flavor.  Hush puppies w/ sweet tea butter: yes. And that butter. It's amazing.  Fried chicken: near perfect. It's definitely a must-have. And could very easily be the best I've ever had.   Charred okra: perfectly done. And the okra wasn't slimy (which, really, is a risk anywhere you go).  Mac & Cheese: So tasty it would make my mama proud.  Kale Grits: not bad - but it was my least favorite side we ordered.   Beer and drink selection is perfectly on point. My husband had a cocktail and it looked divine. I can't wait to go back post-baby to sample!",

We've gone once and the restaurant was half full and we were told an hour wait because they didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen. We were sat within 15 minutes and everything went great. Another time we were told 60-90 minute wait and were sat in 30 minutes. So if you go and the hostess gives you a wait time it's pretty meaningless.",

    "text": "My friend and I were told that this place had the best fried chicken in Charlotte. But it reminded us more of Cracker Barrel (not hating on CB), Haberdish' fried chicken tenders were dry, might have been frozen beforehand and had tough/bland breading. I think KFC or Popeyes has better fried chicken. The deviled eggs were bad. Way too much egg yolk in the stuffing, too much stuffing on top of the egg and it was on a bed of more yolk. Just too much yolk. Trout was tasty but unfortunately didn't make up for the actual deviled egg. Mac and cheese tasted more like Alfredo pasta. Cole Slaw tasted like nothing. Pickles were sweet, juicy and very vinegar-y. Not bad.  The sauces weren't show stoppers either. The Alabama horse radish sauce sounded very promising, in the end it was a glorified salad dressing.   Good service though.",

We have tried almost everything on the menu but highlights include the tea brined fried chicken, the smoked chicken with white sauce, got to have the hush puppies with sweet tea butter and if they offer charred okra with bacon jam  sign me up!  Even those who don't like okra will love this side dish. The kale grits are crazy good and they often feature another special dish featuring grits, in our case they were loaded grits and were very good.  The only complaint I have about Haberdish as with any place in NODA is the parking which can be challenging.  Food: 4.5 Sporks Service: 4 Sporks Atmosphere: 5 Sporks Sweet Tea: 2 Sporks Value: 4 Sporks Local Beer: 3 Sporks",

However, our waiter overhyped the rest of the food a bit unfortunately; saying it was without a doubt the best Mac and cheese, and fried chicken in Charlotte. The fried chicken and Mac and cheese were just \"okay\"...Definitely not the best I've ever had. Chicken was nice and crispy but didn't have much flavor for some reason.  They have a good assortment of mixed drinks and a stocked bar. I'll try this place again next time we're in town to see what the rest of the menu is like.",

If you want to try and schedule a dinner you have to use the Nowait app. You can only check in if you are within 10 miles of the location.   My wife and I tried to go to Haberdish on a Saturday for a post Valentines Day dinner. We checked in when we were 10 miles away from the location. There were already 41 people ahead of us! We left our house at 6pm. The suggested arrival time was 7:35pm.   We arrived and checked in at the restaurant. We were told it was going to be an hour wait, consistent with the Nowait app. However, at 8:30pm, there were still 8 parties ahead of us!   This location is only for people who live in NoDa and can check in right when they get off of work. They really need to reconsider allowing people to make reservations, otherwise it is a poor business model.",

Otherwise it's going to be a long wait and they don't take reservations. The chicken is pretty good as are most of the sides and appetizers. My personal favorites are the deviled eggs and the biscuits with bacon jam. The cocktails are really good and beautiful as well. Share a punch bowl if you are in a bigger group.

    "text": "Outstanding decor but the menu doesn't do much for me.  Drove down to NoDa from Cornelius today from brunch at Haberdish. I't gotten a lot of very good reviews across several platforms and maybe I ordered the wrong items, but it did not do much for me. More on that coming up.  Parking in NoDa is a pain but that is True for any venue in NoDa so be aware and don't let that bother you. Just be prepared to cope with it.  When you enter Haberdish, the interior is outstanding. Very light and attractive with the use of light to create a place of beauty. The bar is particularly well done and obviously, well appointed.  Service is excellent and we were immediately greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. Our server was there immediately with menu and to take our beverage orders..We both ordered coffee and since she was not driving, I ordered her a drink called a Love Potion which is as close to a Bellini as I could come.  Looking over the menu created a problem for my wife. She is on a diet and trying to stay away from fried foods and carbohydrates and there was little on the menu that did not fall into one of these two categories. There was a brined smoked Chicken but the smallest portion was a half a Chicken which is a bit or a large serving.  She ended up with the Kale Salad which turned out to be excellent and the Chared Okra which was OK although the texture was a  bit different.  I order the two piece Fried Chicken all white meat along with Corn Pudding and Chared Okra as well. I know that a wing is technically white meat because of the chemical makeup but to me, I still do not consider it White Meat.  The 2 pieces of White Meat turned out to be one breast and one wing, both overcooked with little flavor outside the coating on the outside and very dry. I felt the same way as my wife about the Chared Okra.  On the other hand, the Corn Pudding was the surprise of the meal. Simply but very flavorful like my mother used to make in the Summer when the Sweet Corn came into the Garden. This was the high light of our meal.  Again. maybe I chose the wrong items because there were another of other items on the menu that looked good and I could have tried. Family at the next table had the Mac and Cheese and it looked great. Maybe I'll try that next time.",

After reading all the amazing reviews I knew it was going to blow my mind. And well that just didn't happen for me. Now, don't her me wrong there were definitely some winners from my meal but overall I was a bit disappointed.  Here's everything we ordered:  Hush puppies Deviled eggs Chicken tenders (with alllll the sauces)  Cauliflower Steak Sweet potato dumplings Mac and cheese - with chicken skins  See what I mean...give me everything on the menu.   The big wins for me were the hush puppies and the mac and cheese with chicken skins. The hush puppies were light and fluffy and the sweet tea butter was excellent! And the mac and cheese was classic - all the flavors were there! But adding the spicy chicken skins totally won me over! Honestly, I should have just asked for a large order  of this for my dinner.   The deviled eggs and chicken tenders were average. Not too special for me but they weren't bad at all. However the only sauces that I really liked were the ranch and bbq. But shout out to the sauces all being made in house!   The things I didn't love were the cauliflower steak and the sweet potato dumplings. The flavors weren't there in the cauliflower for me. The fried chicken coating was too bland for me. And the dumplings just weren't what I expected. I'll chalk that up as to me not reading the menu description.   Oh well.   The service was good. The food just wasn't what I expected.",

    "text": "9/10/2018  Fried chicken, Mac and cheese, these are a few of my favorite things! If you're looking for farm to table comfort food, Haberdish is your spot. My family and I had the pleasure of dining with Haberdish again this past weekend. Our experience was a complete 180 from a few months ago. Everything was perfect, the ambiance, food, and the service (Thank you Heather!!!) My favorite was the creamy macaroni and cheese, next time I'll try it with the crispy chicken skins because the friend chicken is flavorful!   ------------------------ 5/2018 We headed to Haberdish today for my father-in-law's 68th Birthday. It was a very disappointing experience considering all of the wonderful reviews. The restaurant has a trendy earthy, vibe. Upon entering we were barely acknowledged by the hostess who seemed unhappy with her job, in spite of the unwelcoming vibe, I placed our name on the waiting list. 20 minutes later, I received a text notification that our table was ready. We were seated promptly outdoors on their semi-covered patio. Our waitress came over, super bubbly and introduced herself. We ordered rather quickly (within the first 15 minutes of being seated) but it took forever for our food to arrive. When it finally did, the appetizers and entrees came out at the same time. As for the food: the biscuits were burnt and the fried chicken was dry. We sent the biscuits back and the replacements were a bit better. The side dishes lacked flavor (macaroni and cheese, sweet potato dumplings, and kale grits) Shortly after receiving our food, the service stopped, no one came by to check on us and we received no additional refills. We were left with empty glasses of tea and lukewarm water. When we finally spotted our waitress, I had to flag her down. I asked for a water to-go (I was very thirsty) and the check. When she brought the check, I guess she was trying to save face since we were all sitting there with sad looks and she offered refills.   Bottom line: The food is instagram-able for those doing it for the 'gram but at best the food was mediocre and we left very underwhelmed. Maybe we stopped in on an off day but for us we wanted this to be a special experience for my father-in-laws birthday. I don't think I'll be back.",

Fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and FULL of flavor. The brine adds flavor and keeps the meat from drying out.",

Went on a Wed/Thurs with a friend. My treat.. walked in and was greet right alway. Love the decor. Wood beam with reuse jean fabric booth hosiery! Good ole chic farm feel.  We sat down. Order our drinks. And omg their drinks are strong. No joke. I had one and done. I don't think I even finish it. Got a nice buzz very early one.  Here's what I ordered.. and you better NOT judge. I wanted to try it all!   Deviled eggs,  dill house pickles,  hushpuppies,  biscuits with bacon jam,  4 pieces of dark meat chicken,  cast iron NC trout,  mac and cheese with chicken skin topping,  kale grits,  sweet potatoes dumplings,  corn bread puddings and  chocolate sheet cake!   Some highlights. The breading on the chicken is awesome. Right amount of season and crispy just the way I like it. I tried a little of kale grits. Meh. Sweet potatoes dumpling was comforting. A nice natural sweet taste to it. Love the corn bread pudding. And omg I'm crazy about the trout. Presentation was nicely done. Crispy skin up and perfectly cook. And best of all, mac and cheese with the skin.. I need to starve myself the next 3 weeks for that.  Lastly, the chocolate sheet cake. That's one thing I didn't care for. The cake is very solid and cold with the raspberry sauce was tart therefore it overpower the cake completely. I only took 2 bites. Many kudos to the manager Jim on duty that night. At one point I saw him darted pass just. Thought he was chasing a criminal. Nooo, a customer forgot their leftover. How sweet. You can count on me to come back!",

    "text": "Southern meets swanky. The hype is real, y'all.   I have been so excited for Haberdish to join the Charlotte culinary scene and it was worth the wait. Real talk: this is the only restaurant where I will ever order chicken tenders. You win #alltheawards for chicken tenders.   Before I talk about the rest of the food, here's an important life hack for this place: get on your Yelp app and use the wait list option. Yes, you can literally put yourself on the waitlist. It's always going to be busy. Don't act surprised, don't bitch about it, just deal with it. And if you don't feel like waiting (or talking to human beings), you can get on the Haberdish website and place to go orders.   Our visit here we got: cheese straws (the only thing we didn't love), dill house pickles (bread & butter and a daily option as available), biscuits & bacon jam (the winner of the apps), deviled eggs (a very close runner up), chicken tenders, smoked chicken (Alabama White Sauce is what made this dish), sweet potato dumplings, mac n cheese with crispy chicken skins, broccolini, charred okra, tots, and the waffle for dessert. Before you plan an eating intervention for me, please note that this was all split among four people. I thought everything was delicious. I love their homemade hot sauce. The table as a whole did not love the sweet potato dumplings. They are different. I liked them, though I may not order them every time because there are so many delicious side options. On Sundays, they do chicken and waffles. Tuesdays, chicken and biscuits.   I didn't do a cocktail this visit, just a glass of rose. Colleen was just named Charlotte's best bartender by Thrillist. I have no doubt you can't go wrong with a drink here.   The most surprising thing for me was how affordable a meal can be. I paid for my rose, an app, couple chicken tenders, couple sides, part of the dessert and spent less than $30 (before tip).   If you're not familiar with NoDa, a warning that parking completely blows in this neighborhood. Be patient, drive around, pay attention to signs, and don't block anyone's driveway.",

    "text": "WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, HABERDISH!! Sorry to yell, but I'm just THAT EXCITED about this new spot in NoDa. We went at 7pm on a Friday night and were greeted with a 70-90 minute wait. Sounded pretty awful until we realized a) they use a cool app called waitlist that told us where in line we were/how many parties were in front of us and b) we were only a few doors down from Salud! So, off we went for some beers while we waited for a table. We left Salud and headed back with 2 parties in front of us. Within 60-seconds of walking back in, our table was ready! Happy day!! Time to stuff our faces!!!  Now, I'm going to tell you that we ordered almost everything on the menu and you're probably not going to believe me. But seriously, check out this list and our photographic evidence below:    - Livermush - Deviled eggs - House pickles    - Hushpuppies - Chicken Tenders - 1/4 fried chicken, dark - Cauliflower steak  - Sweet potato dumplings - Broccolini  - Cornbread pudding  - Tater tots  - Mac 'n cheese - Banana pudding  - House made coffee, chocolate cake ice cream   We tried to order the kale grits but they were out. And that doesn't even include our drinks! (The mint juleps are the jam, y'all!)    Every single bite of every single dish was perfect! It's hard to pick favorites, but if I must... I loved the cauliflower steak and sweet potato dumplings. Ted's favorites were the livermush toast and pickles.   Our server, Marnie, was a dream! Just attentive and friendly enough without being over bearing or too \"in your face.\" We had a little bit of business to do with our friend over dinner (we're planning a wedding here, people!!) and Marnie was happy to let us take over the table with notebooks and a laptop for a couple hours.   The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. I loved the simple hostess \"stand\" at the front - a tablet mounted to the wall - and the bar area is big and warmly welcoming. The cutlery is a rose, copper color and just gorgeous! All the food is served on pretty platters, family style. And, their tasteful, restrained use of mason jars is strong!   So, I say again, WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, HABERDISH! Your upscale Southern food served with a smile is a welcome addition to the Queen City's restaurant scene. We can't wait to visit again and often!",

If there are any negative reviews on Yelp about Haberdish, I'll never understand why (to the man complaining about the types of people dining at Haberdish, specifically complaining about the mean wearing pocket tshirts, broaden your horizons and please get over yourself).   This place has some of the best friend chicken I've ever put in my mouth. The breading used for the chicken is out of this world. Haberdish takes \"tater tots\" to a new level. Rather than your standard fried tot, this tater tot actually tastes like a baked potato in tot form. It's absolutely incredible. They have a kale salad which is an amazing app that is served with goat cheese and mandarin oranges.  I've tried nearly all their apps, and apart from the tots, the sweet potato dumplings and the hushpuppies are incredible.   Their brunch menu is out of this world, and is so much better than most brunch spots you can find in CLT - OH and brunch i served on the weekdays here...find me a place other than Tupelo Honey that serves brunch on weekdays.   Oh...and that only covers the food. The specialty cocktails and the atmosphere are awesome. If you're wanting to go somewhere and have a full-on dining experience, Haberdish is your place. They have the culture, the food, the drinks, and the service to create a really one-of-a-kind place. Don't believe me? Southern Living just voted them #2 Restaurant of the South.",

Thank goodness because it filled up very quickly afterward.   Our server was new but he was extremely friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. We ordered a larger portion of one of the cocktails with a flower in the ice, and split it when it arrived. It was very good!  For apps, we split the hush puppies (oh my god, to die for) and the deviled eggs.   For dinner, I ordered two fried chicken tenders and the creamy kale grits. The batter on the chicken tenders was perfectly salty and flavorful. The grits were a little on the saltier side but still delicious. The saddest part of the meal was that I couldn't eat all of my chicken tenders, I was so stuffed.   Ugh, it was all so good....",

For dinner, we had fried chicken, mac and cheese, and loaded grits. All were damn good! Dessert was the flourless chocolate cake. It was overall good, but I could've done without the whipping cream and sweet potato garnish.   The waiter was somewhat aloof, but the young lady training alongside was super sweet and made up for it.   We'll definitely be back!",

We shared the cinnamon roll, which was delicious, especially with the milk caramel sauce. We ordered the chicken and waffles, which were good with the honey butter syrup, and the  delicious quiche du jour, which came with an overly tart kale salad.  While we thought the food was between 3-4 stars, what solidified the higher rating was the ambiance. We were seated in the outdoor side patio, which was wonderful in the fall.

The Hushpuppies were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and also accompanied by some delicious sweet tea butter. The sweet potato dumplings reminded us of gnocchi and they were sooo good! They were a little fried on the outside for texture and had sage and parm as seasoning. We decided to try the sonker for dessert as we'd never heard of such a thing before. It was made to order and was super hot (be careful!). It was kinda of pie crust with a berry sauce underneath. The milk dip that accompanied it was unnecessary as the sonker was good on it's own, plus the dip was really sweet. The service was friendly and the ambiance was super cute and quaint!",

For my meal, I ordered the chicken biscuit and a side of cheese grits. The sandwich was huge and worth the price. The downside to the meal, however, was that everything was over salted. The sandwich, grits, and hush puppies all had a strong salted taste, which took away from the meal a bit. The thigh on the chicken sandwich also isn't great. You are probably better off ordering it with tenders. The thigh was not very good and had a lot of fat.",

On the other hand their food is subpar. The flavor combinations would work well if they were executed correctly. I ordered the bacon and jam biscuit which the jam was good but the biscuit was very dry and the jam wasn't juicy enough to compliment it. I also ordered the chicken tender and a waffle. The chicken tender had grill marks on it under the batter. As if they cooked the chicken then battered and fried it. and it sure tastes that way DRY! The waffle tasted like they used the same biscuit batter and just pressed it in the waffle maker and added clumps of sugar on it. It was also raw in the middle but still dry. We came as a party of 8 and nothing anyone had was great all dry and subpar.",

I got the 2 piece white meat with a side and it was more than enough for lunch. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were making drinks the whole time and they looked very interesting. I didn't get one as I was going to a brewery after lunch.   I went with someone who is gluten free and they had a separate menu which told you which items were gluten free. It was awesome having that option. She ended up getting the ribs and they were fall off the bone good. Would love to come back and try some of their craft cocktails when I get a chance.",

It is the CUTEST place in Noda (a cute little strip of bars, shops, restaurants and breweries in Charlotte).   The moment you walked in, you were greeted with a smile and we sat down at the bar. They had creative and delicious different drinks (a bit spendy I must say). But the food was even better! I split a side of macaroni and cheese with fried chicken skin (this could easily be a meal). Tip - you HAVE to get the fried chicken skin, great taste and crunch! Then we ordered a fried chicken sandwich drizzled with homemade honey mustard and sandwiched between a homemade biscuit. I am already started to drool as I remember how amazing it was. You will be extremely full after, but it will be so worth it!",

    "text": "I wish, I wish, upon a star, to be eating here for dinner on a day, not too far!   Bring it on. Bring it all on. I'm trying to rationalize going out to eat again (okay, look, it's hard to get to uptown when you live at the lake.)   I'm impressed, and presently salivating at the memory of my dinner.   For starters...they use Springer Mountain Farms chickens which are vegetarian fed and pesticide/antibiotic/hormone free. The quality starts in the ingredients, I'm sure we can all agree.   The entrees are served a la carte which allows for some flexibility in your dinner plate!   I ordered a biscuit, one chicken tender, sweet potato dumplings, mac and cheese, cauliflower steak and a kale salad. I'm going to break this down for you, mostly because each item rocked my socks.   Biscuit- unique, flaky, buttery, and must have had an egg wash on top for the glossy finish it had. Served with a butter so tasty-so sweet that they must have churned it while whispering it sweet nothings.   Chicken tender-meaty, moist, juicy, and the breading was flavorful and actually stuck to it. I don't know about you, but when the breading falls off, it makes me sad. High-fives!   Mac and cheese- cheesy and delicious. Not the best I've had, though. Probably would pass on this one going forward.   Kale salad- this salad was stupid good. It could have been the candied benne mixed with the oranges and goat cheese, maybe it was the pomegranate molasses dressing. I don't know. But I was nursing this salad like it had no tomorrow. So. Good.   Cauliflower steak- since when do you swoon over cauliflower? Oh yea, since eating here. The flavor profile is so complex and tasty! The serving size was huge! You never know with vegetable steaks the size you're getting, and they didn't disappoint. It was delicious! Crispy edges, just what you need.   Sweet potato dumplings- brown butter, sage, and parm. Say it with me (in your best southern woman voice) \"Lawwwwwd have mercy!!!\" These dumplings brought me to my knees. It was a religious experience. You think I'm kidding? I literally thanked God then and there for the genius minds that concocted this heavenly dish. I have never had sweet potato dumplings before, and now I can say I need no other. They kind of taste like gnocchi in regards to their texture, which makes sense because it's potato based.   When you're willing to go back to a restaurant for their SIDE DISHES (and that's in no way a slam to their entrees which are amazing) that is a testament to the genius in the kitchen here.   They had a nice variety on their drink menu. I was a little unbalanced when my brut sparkling wine was sweet, but it was still good. The Tannat red wine was so smooth and even bodied! Definitely the best wine I've ordered at a restaurant--great item on the wine list.  We also utilized the NoWait app which allowed us to grab drinks somewhere else and be notified when our table was ready. Very nice!   True southern cuisine, my friends. I'm looking forward to a brunch here!",

The two pieces were oh so crispy and delicious best I've had in Charlotte in fact over the years. My side dish was of course the house made tater tots paired with my beautiful fried chicken. A habanero house made buffalo sauce was nice to experience pouring over bits of chicken and tots. My wife had the kale salad which doesn't sound exciting at all, but it had mandarin oranges w goat cheese in a large plate which tasted great.  By the time we finished lunch the place was hoping a buzz of activity. Really want to try the cinnamon roll, liver mush, sweet potato dumplings, and few other things next visit. Haberdish could easily open at 10:30am as we stood in line with at least ten people ready to eat.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to dinner at this popular NoDa spot, but came away wishing it had more successfully lived up to its reputation. Our party started off with an assortment of appetizers, including the Pimento Cheese Ball, Deviled Eggs and Hush Puppies. None of us found any of the dishes to be particularly outstanding, though I'll confess Southern food isn't exactly my thing. And while my friends enjoyed the cocktails they ordered from the restaurant's extensive menu, the limited selection of local brews was disappointing.  For my entree, I ordered Haberdish's renowned Fried Chicken, which I found to be dry and lacking in flavor. There are some outstanding fried chicken joints in Charlotte, and Haberdish didn't measure up to any of them. Service throughout our meal was efficient but not particularly attentive, requiring us to flag down the closest waiter on more than a few occasions.   The restaurant has a nice, casual vibe - tables are comfortably spaced and there's a patio that looks like the perfect afternoon to enjoy Sunday brunch in nice weather. But I was really expecting Haberdish to serve up great Southern cooking, and on that count, it didn't deliver.",

My Charlotte resident friends liked the place and I was impressed by the drinks, food and service. What really gets me, coming from Portland where you can't get brunch without a long wait and rude service, is that this place had no wait and all of the servers were incredibly nice!   Drinks: for brunch cocktails they have one of my favorite drinks - a boozy coffee and milk with a splash of club soda. They also have an extensive cocktail menu besides the brunch cocktails. I had the banana cocktail which was delicious and I was eyeing a few more for the next time I'm back in Charlotte.    Food: We started with some hush puppies - yum. I usually don't like hush puppies but these were good. As a group we ordered food to share, so we got a whole fried chicken, small order of ribs, okra, mac and cheese and roasted carrots. Everything was delicious but the stand out for me was the okra. I could not stop eating it.   Dessert was a banana pudding, a perfect way to end the meal. It went well with the coffee, which they serve in thermos containers - so quirky. If I'm back in Charlotte, this is one stop I want to revisit for sure.",

Come thirsty and try an extensively distinctive and intriguing cocktail menu that will have you driving back until you've tried them all. My latest experience was truly delightful due to outstanding service provided by Chris and the best cheesecake I've ever had! I would also suggest to ask for a side of bacon jam with your cheesy Mac & Cheese for a exceptional gratification to your comfort food needs.

If you're thinking about skipping dessert, don't-- they always have something incredible on the menu.   Anytime an out of town guest comes to Charlotte, THIS is the place I take them.

The cinnamon roll was dry which was disappointing since I was really looking forward to it when I saw that they were housemade. In all fairness I did not have a cocktail so I can't really give an opinion about that but they did look pretty good from what I saw. This place has raving reviews from many but maybe it's just not my cup of tea. One other thing that was a slight turn off was the massive amount of flies that were around outside. I realize the business probably does not have much control of that but it was a huge turn off for us. Fighting flies while you eat is no fun.",

We walked up and down NODA to find this lovely spot. It wasn't too busy so we went on into the bar area since March Madness was on tv. We got greeted by a cool bartender (love the Legends of the Hidden temple throwback shirt) and gave us some waters while we looked at the menu.  A look at the menu showed some craft cocktail drinks. I don't know how to emphasize that this was truly craft rather than just throwing that name out there. I ordered the Honey Hibiscus Punch and it has got to be one of the smoothest drinks I have ever ordered. My husband ordered the Peach Keen Punch. It had bourbon in it (something I'm not a big fan of), but after a sip - I think I could have ordered and enjoyed it myself since it was just as smooth to drink.  After enjoying a few sips, we decided to order some appetizers and small plates as our late dinner. I ordered some smoked deviled eggs. Husband and I shared his mac and cheese with spicy chicken skins. He got a plate of some of their fried chicken.  I like the twist on the food. I love me some deviled eggs and loved how smooth the filling was. I could taste the smoky flavors, but happily not overwhelmed. The fried chicken was tasty and the meat was tender. The mac and cheese was a big serving despite getting the smaller size. We're not big on spice, but the chicken skins were still enjoyable despite our weak palette for it.  I loved the vibe of the place. It was rustic with the wood touches and felt modern with the clean lines of the place. The staff was down to earth and welcoming. A one of a kind spot with some smooth drinks and a nice twist on southern food.",

A guy in our party ordered bourbon and they gave him a huge ice cube with a flower inside, beautiful!  Now for food. I'm really sad to be writing a review because I'm on a diet so I feel like I can't even review all the awesome food here. I swear I'll come back and order all the delicious looking items when my 30 days are over. We ordered deviled eggs and biscuits as an appetizer. The biscuits were huge! Everyone loved them. The deviled eggs were fine. Most people in our party ordered the fried chicken which looked amazing! The smoked chicken looked awesome too. One friend even ordered the fried cauliflower and she loved it too. I ordered the trout. It looked amazing but it was way too salty and I did not love it :(. I was really bummed about it because based on everyone else's reactions this place definitely deserves a 5, I will be back to order fried chicken, mac and cheese, cocktails, and dessert and re-review.   But overall I love this restaurant and can't wait to come back! We had an amazing time at our dinner, great props to the service!",

The service was excellent as well. We were really impressed with our server, Courtney.  To start we tried the deviled eggs and the hush puppies. The eggs were huge and deliciously flavored, and the hush puppies came with a sweet tea butter. We thought sweet tea and butter was weird at first, but it was really delicious!  We had the fried chicken and chicken tenders. Both were excellent! The waffles were really good. I wasn't a big fan of the sweet potato dumplings, but I loved the tater tots. We also went out on a limb and had the pickled green beans. They were pretty good.   Since we had a birthday to celebrate, we also got a banana pudding, and you are missing out if you don't try this at the end of your meal. It was awesome! All the desserts looked awesome! If we weren't so stuffed from all the food, we would have loved to have tried more.  I also really appreciated that they give us warm, moist towels to wipe our hands and mouths at the end of the meal.",

The fried chick was well seasoned. The white sauce ended up being a combination of ranch and horseradish. Take from that what you will. The kale salad was delightful and unexpected. It had the creative flavor.... sweet moments and texture from seedlike elements.   Service was great and the bar tenders worked as a team. Nice place.

FYI you can save your place on yelp, which is amazing because they usually have a long wait.  I began with a cocktail the bartender recommended. It was the BBQ apple milk punch. It was delicious. I followed this with a black Manhattan, which I was also very happy with.   I ordered Pickled asparagus, deviled eggs, biscuits with bacon jam, and 2 chicken tenders. I love that there is the option to order a bunch of small things. I loved the deviled eggs and the chicken tenders. They have a lot of flavor and I love that they give you a sauce of your choice to go with it. $2.50 chicken tenders is nice, especially if you want to just go have a nice cocktail and want a quick snack. I wish the bacon jam was more jam-like.   Our second time here they forgot our order (not sure how because we were sitting at the bar and hopefully they noticed how long we had been sitting there without food), but they took all the food off of our bill and we were able to sip great cocktails, so I was happy they took care of it so quickly. I was just surprised we had to ask where our food was and they didn't notice it had been a while.   All in all, I like this place. I love the option to get a big entree or be able to just order some snacks. The cocktails are really my favorite part of this place.",

    "text": "First off, this is a super chill place to just grab a drink with a friend. The environment is really cool and laid back.  The food is probably some of the best Southern food I've had around. It's one of the best places in NoDa to get good food and good drinks. I will say it is ALWAYS packed around meal times, the wait is usually over an hour but there's a good reason why!  The drinks I think are my favorite part. The bartenders who work there are super knowledgeable and actually contribute to the drink menu their own concoctions they make! They're great at making stuff up on the fly too. Went in one time and asked if they recommended something sweeter, and the bartender make a drink with Gin in it on the spot and it was delicious. Definitely head there as part of your visit to Charlotte, and more specifically the NoDa area in general.",

Our drinks were awesome and our waitress (Marty, I believe) was wonderful. They were super friendly and I have zero complaints. The serving size of our food was great. We each ordered an entree and shared two single serving sides. We couldn't finish it all.   Decent: the food.  I had chicken tenders -- they were huge and served hot. I asked to try all of the sauces and they happily brought them. Overall, the tenders were a little short on flavor but good none the less. My fiance had the fried chicken (white meat) -- I didn't have any but he described it as good and crispy. He said it had good flavor and wasn't greasy. Not the best he's ever had but solid. The mac and cheese with chicken skin -- I only had a few bites of it (cheese is not always my friend) and thought it was okay. My fiance and I both felt that the mac and cheese would've been better baked (but that's a matter of personal preference).  The sweet potato dumplings -- these were tasty, other than the fact that they were a bit too salty for me. Other than that, I loved the flavor and the texture of them.   Not my #1 spot in Charlotte but a solid choice that I am sure we will visit again.",

Tea comes in mason jars, rose gold cutlery, and reclaimed wood everywhere. Unfortunately my dish just fell flat.   I ordered the egg tartine. It sounded like an interesting dish, with a soft boiled egg over arugula, beet spread, pickled red onion, with a sage honey vinaigrette. I believe the main culprit was the amount of beet spread that just overwhelmed what should have been a light dish. I just couldn't get into it.  I will say the service was super friendly considering me and my coworkers parked it there for hours. I know that's not the most ideal situation for a server, so kudos to her for refilling our waters and being patient with us. I would absolutely give this place another shot, as I really feel like maybe this is one of the misses on the menu.",

My sister just recently moved to Charlotte and we wanted to carry on our Charleston tradition of having at least one 5-star dining experience per visit. She chose Haberdish for my first Charlotte meal and I am so glad she did.  We sat at the bar (as you should always do!) and we immediately hit it off with our bartender. I didn't get her name and she left early (she wasn't feeling well but didn't let it show at all) but she helped us pick a drink and our meal. We split the Liquid Pumpkin Pie Punch ($22 for a medium - ended up being about 4 1/2 glasses), which was given to us with a beautiful sprinkling of flowers and a great presentation on how to pour the punch.  For our meal, we started with the pimento cheese ball ($9, and we brought home most of it) which came with apples and homemade crackers that were delicious. We then shared the cauliflower steak ($12 and more than enough for 2 people) and the bbq glazed carrots ($6 for half or $12 for whole).   Everything was top-notch and each bite was better than the last. I am so very impressed and hope to check out more of the menu on my next visit.",

I grew up in the deep south, so I'm always a little skeptical when somewhere not in GA, MS or AL tries to serve southern dishes - but Haberdish was spot on with their food.  It was delicious.  And although I normally don't like anything but butter in my grits - the kale grits were good!    The inside had a cozy and comfortable feeling - they had tables for large groups or communal dining, as well as individual tables.  Will definitely go back.",

    "text": "As soon as I saw a picture of the Mac and cheese, I knew I would be a patron at this restaurant. A few weeks ago I made the foolish last minute decision to go to the taco place across the street (which must have been having an off night) instead of Haberdish. I didn't make that mistake a second time.  My date and I were seated immediately, near the lovely barn doors. No one was seated out there when we went, but it looks like a great place to enjoy a meal. The cocktail list was unlike anything I see regularly. I had the Love Potion #10 after much pondering, and it tasted just as amazing as the description suggested.  First up was the fluffy hush puppies. This is unlike what you would eat at a fish camp, tough on the outside and inside. Certainly the best I've ever had, and the sweet tea butter (sounded frightful to me but I gave it a chance) was the icing on top, so to speak. My friend didn't want any initially, and after I harassed her to try one, she agreed that they were smashing, and we finished them all.  She ordered the chicken and waffles, I went with the Mac and cheese with skin- large portion. I will say that at other places, I've chosen to get the smaller size, only to be presented by an amount that could fit into a cup- so I told myself I'd just go large from here on out. Well.....this time, I should've sized down. The Mac and cheese was incredibly rich- and I'm no slouch when it come to m&c. I eat it regularly, no waiting for Thanksgiving over here! I couldn't even eat half of it at the table. No worries, I had some for a late snack and then for lunch the next day. So none of it went to waste.  I'm one of those weirdos that only eat chicken when  it's in wing form, so the fried chicken wasn't something I wanted for myself. My friend had me try hers, and it was extremely tasteful and moist.   Miles beyond some of the other establishments around town which seem to have an aversion to well seasoned chicken. Maybe some people think all the taste will come from the oil it's fried in, but what do I know? I'm just here to eat!  The waffle was pretty dry and not to her liking. She would've soldiered along and ate it all, but the syrup was not something either of us wanted to partake in. I'm not sure what the flavor was, it reminded me of prune juice, I guess our palettes weren't appreciative of the creativity behind the choice. All in all, we were pleased and I will be thrilled to return.  It's a great date place also, the environment is great, whether for drinks or eats.",

We both got chicken and waffles with sweet butter syrup. Personally, was not a huge fan of it. Honestly, I thought the dish would come with more chicken than it did. The chicken was tasty, but over cooked. The waffle was too sweet and dense for my liking as well. Dish was too sweet for me. Haberdish has their own hot sauce, but was not hot enough to counter balance the sweet. I used so much. Overall, would come back for the Mac and cheese, but not the chicken and waffles. 4 stars for the Mac and cheese, sweet tea, and ambiance.",

We sat out on the patio, where it was comfortable at first but colder and colder as our meal went on. By dessert, we were ready to bolt! I'm sure they'll get heat lamps for next fall, considering they just opened and knew summer was coming. If you're going to sit outside, it's on you to bring a jacket. Don't be like us!   We shared Tenders, Macncheese, Hushpuppies, Dill pickles and each ordered a biscuit. I would recommend getting the full size Macncheese over the half portion because it's definitely more than double. We each took home a portion as leftovers. Everything we ordered was just as delicious and consistent as on my first visit. The pickles come as spears and could've used a little more time in the pickle but they were still crisp and sour. I ordered the lemon tartlet to try after seeing it featured on their Instagram page. Thin tart shell, light on the lemon curd and heavy on the whipped cream. Good ending to our meal but not your typical 1/2 in of curd in a traditional lemon tart.   Cheers go out to our waitress who realized we were going to take enough food home to make a plate and brought us a box for our chicken and biscuit, a container for our mac, parchment to wrap our pickles in so they don't get everything else soggy and bags since we had two containers each. Super thoughtful and way more attention to detail than I've seen anywhere for a to go box.   Haberdish, I'm in trouble, twice in one week. Who knows what's to come!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to go to Haberdish since I first moved to Charlotte! I had read such great reviews and wanted to try things out for myself! I got the chicken tenders which were huge, so I could only eat 2! I also got the small size of the charred okra which was probably my favorite part of the meal. You have to get the bacon jam on top! I also ordered the Mac and cheese with the spicy chicken skins on top! The Macaroni was very good but the chicken skins definitely bring some heat to the dish so be aware of that! The small size of the sides is definitely enough to feed 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are and the tenders are big so 2 were plenty! I also got a biscuit to go with the meal and it came with their sweet tea butter which was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back! Next time I want to go for brunch! I follow them on Instagram which makes my mouth water every time they post a picture!",

Since they have been getting so much traffic we decided to go early.  Well, unlike most other Brunch spots they don't start until 11:30 am. We just hung around for the 30 minutes. Now, the food is awesome!  Hands down, the BEST chicken and Waffles in the CITY!! I can actually enjoy a waffle without syrup, thank goodness, because the sauce that comes with the waffles is not very tasty. Its like honey...Its the only thing I didn't enjoy.We tried the deviled eggs: I like my deviled eggs sweet, but they weren't bad. The cornbread pudding: it was delish! Reminded me of corn bread that tastes a little like Thanksgiving dressing. BUT the COCKTAILS...I tried the Love Potion, Rum Punch and the Hibiscus drink, my, my, my...their concoctions are one of a kind! Quite a few flavors I wasn't familiar with but man, they were swell!!! Overall, they have a super exciting spot here. I look forward to going up on a Tuesday (Biscuit night, yay!)  Parking is dreadful in NoDa. Hopefully, that will improve in the near future as there is another restaurant next door that will soon open.",

    "text": "Our group of four visited on a Saturday mid-afternoon. We sat outside. The inside was decorated farmhouse chic and with the sun shining we opted for under the pergola outside. We had several craft beers and one of our group ordered a bourbon drink with an orange finish which we all sipped because it was delightful. We had one half fried chicken, one half brined smoked chicken, a 2 piece white fried chicken and a pork shank. All entrees were excellent. Moist, flavorful and tasty. We had sides of charred okra ( super good), mac and cheese (very good) and tater tots. My only slight ding is a personal issue with the tots. Since I've never had home-made tots I must be crazy because I like the Ore-Ida store bought slightly better. The Ore-Ida seemed to have more potato flavor. It seems illogical that in-house is less flavor than mass produced so I didn't deduct any stars because it makes no sense. Must be me. I felt like the prices were worth the fare....no issue. A satisfying meal. Oh, our server was excellent. We didn't see her a great deal but we didn't require much from her after the food was dropped off.",

I recommend the fried chicken, which is the signature entree IMO. I also enjoyed the deviled eggs appetizer. My first visit about a year ago I had the braised ribs, which were very good; however, they were not on the menu when I ate there about a month ago so I tried the bbq ribs w/ glazed carrots for my side. The ribs were overcooked and the sauce was way too sweet for my taste; same for the sugary glaze on the carrots. Generally, I found the menu options to be limited; a better mix of sides would also be a welcomed addition (e.g., rice pilaf, potatoes, sauteed string beans or broccoli, seasonal mixed veggies, etc.). I think they are on the right track. If they tone down the sugar in some of the dishes/sauces and tweak the menu options a bit, I would definitely consider returning.",

    "text": "Had a great experience! We went relatively early on a Saturday night (6:15ish), and got a table outside right away. It took forever for someone to take our drink orders, but they seemed to realize this and were really friendly and did a semi-decent job explaining the delay. Easily forgiven.  I wasn't super excited about the menu because I like to eat semi-healthy, but I threw calories to the wind and just enjoyed a super fattening, high sodium meal. If you want to enjoy yourself, go there with a similar mindset. We started with the pimento cheese, and I think it's the first time in five years of dating that my husband ate more of an appetizer than I did (cheese and crackers aren't typically his thing). The fried chicken was amazing (I got 2 which is plenty for a normal female appetite; the man - who usually eats enough for a small army - got 4 pieces and said it was too much). We also split a mac and cheese and sweet potato dumplings. Both amazing, but the dumplings were a little too salty for me at this point in the meal.  No room for dessert after we each had three drinks (Prosecco which was eh and Old Fashioned which he said were really good...mostly because of the clear ice cubes).  Highly recommend. But make sure to hydrate before. Your body will thank you for it later.  Also, a good value. 6 drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 chicken orders, 2 sides = $120 w/tip.",

How long is the wait? Depends. You won't mind. Go browse the great shops in Noda while you wait or grab a drink elsewhere.  Haberdish is a restaurant that gets it...and will continue to get faithful swarms of customers that love a restaurant that gets it.  The inside is spacious and appropriately lit for a jovial celebration or a romantic (albeit a bit boisterous on the weekend) dinner. There is a coastal Italian feel to the place that feels airy and light.  The food...oh the food! Let me get one thing out of the way. I don't think adults should ever order chicken fingers. It's just a thing with me. Pull them britches up and order chicken on the bone. There I said it...and will probably keep saying it.   That being said...I am always prepared to challenge my assumptions and assertions in every facet of my life. We ordered some chicken fingers...GASP!!  What did I just do? Ugh...regret pouring in...and the shame...oh the shame... boatloads of shame...day after day...more of the same...UGH....sorry!  Great service! Didn't trigger the chicken finger shaming. Great service!  Holy...What! How can this adults kid menu item be so delicious? As a good friend from back home would say...\"It's the Dippin Sauce.\" He's right! The chicken is insanely good...but it's the fact that you will finish your chicken strips before you ever decide which \"dippin sauce\" you like best. Fantastic! I will now allow you to \"not\" be judged by me for eating chicken fingers...at least here...lol.  Here's what else we had...and I'll spare you the lengthy gushfest...because you won't need it. Selling you on a kids menu item needed a bit of a sell.  The biscuit and bacon jam. You heard biscuit and bacon...right? Sweet potato dumplings...an odd addition...but good nonetheless. The mac'n'cheese was good...but I'm not replacing Aunt Jennifer's recipe with it. I can't remember if we had anything else...I was food-drunk halfway through the meal.  Ohh...almost forgot...the drinks. All of the cocktails (not that I had all of them...or did I?) were homeruns (sorry about the football talk)! Spot on and unique! The beer selection was nice...but I see room for improvement.  Lastly...come here. It's very reasonably priced. It's comfortable and delicious!  Try: The hushpuppies...I forgot to mention them. The best...yes...best I've ever had!  Avoid: Not a thing",

Let me back up...We heard about this restaurant from a friend who heard good things about this place. So, we were in the neighborhood and were excited to try the food. The only plus, we were seated immediately.   1. Our waiter was lackluster, it's as if we were wasting his time. Very little interaction on his part. At the end of our meal, I wanted to have him give a message to give to the kitchen, but he collected the plates and the paid bill so quickly, I did not get the opportunity to do so.   2. As vegetarians, we look for restaurants with new takes on veggies. We ordered the cauliflower steak and BBQ carrots. The cauliflower steak was a huge portion, and it looked absolutely delicious. However, the cauliflower was so salty, I was unable to finish my portion. I honestly would have been better off dipping the cauliflower in salt water to tone down the amount of salt on it. I don't think anyone from the kitchen tasted the food before they sent it out. The carrots were good.  We spent about 30 minutes in this restaurant, and spent less than $25. I am thankful that we did not come here with a large group and paid more for this experience.",

The chicken fingers were freshly made, moist and hot. The waffles were dense (in a good way) and well flavored. The dill pickles were nice and tangy and a great recipe! The tater tots were fluffy and crispy. The Mac n cheese disappeared in 5 min flat with all of us grabbing spoonfuls.   I would highly recommend this restaurant. The ambiance was just the right amount of cozy and trendy. With six people it is sometimes hard to accommodate us and they easily found us a table.   Watch out for parking though- it's tricky! We had to find a parking lot nearby to pay to park and walk a short distance.   I would definitely go back to this restaurant! It is highly recommended!",

I realize not everyone will like this, as the consistency is different and it doesn't look all that great but again it is my fav.

I've never had bacon jam before and I will dream about it for days to come. The biscuits were fluffy and the jam was abundant! The hush puppies were so soft and pillowy. I could eat basket after basket of them.  For dinner I had the cauliflower steak. I am obsessed with fried cauliflower and this did not disappoint. Some of the florets were a bit tough to cut into, but still delicious. I shared the fried chicken with my fiance and it was to die for. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and not too greasy.   Oh, and the sweet potato dumplings!!! That is the definition of comfort food. They were tender and tasty and I want more.  I can't wait to go back! This is my new favorite restaurant!",

The Southern menu is comparable to food you'd find in Charleston... I was highly satisfied. 2 chicken tenders  ($2.50 each) and a side will fill you up for right around $10. You can't go wrong. The cocktail menu is extensive and they have great wine selection. I'll be back!",

We arrive (two of us and my dog) and get seated outside, although it is clearly about to rain. Before she was even done setting up our table, I asked the hostess what we would do if it started to rain. She went inside to ask a manager and told us that if it started to rain we could (the humans) could move to the patio, but since the patio was no dogs allowed, the dog would have to stay outside. I brought to her attention that no one else was sitting on the patio and that would mean tying my dog up in the rain, and if that was the case we would be leaving. She said she understood, so we left.   Two stars because I'm sure the food is good. My dog is a service animal, but I didn't feel like retrieving her papers since clearly they were strongly opposed, as she was not allowed to come onto the (outdoor, but covered) patio, even in the event of thunder and lightings.",

I haven't had a chance to try the brunch yet since it's during weekdays only, but the dinner service has always been great. The menu is simple but still unique and incredibly tasty. The drink menu is also fantastic and their cocktails are one of a kind, although on the pricier side. If you want to give this restaurant a try, go as close to opening as you can stand or definitely utilize the wait-list feature on Yelp! Otherwise, you could be waiting 90+ minutes. Absolutely one of my favorite places to go and a great place to take family or friends when they come to visit.",

My husband said the white meat was juicy but the dark meats (drums and wing) were very very dry.  The hush puppies were mediocre but the butter was out of this world.  Pickles were good condiment to cut the richness. All other apps were very mediocre.   Service:   This part was the part I wasn't too happy with.  It was a mission to get a servers attention to save my life.  Some walking by staffs met eye contact yet looked away.  It was just really unacceptable.

The lighting and rustic wood really goes great with what I think the restaurant is trying to establish.   Make sure to fire up the Yelp app and check the wait list and put your name in early! They have quite the extensive cocktail list so you've got to try one! They are handcrafted and almost look to good to drink.   Their menu is set up so that's easy to share with friends or also easy to get just want you need. Their chicken comes in 4 different varieties. 2 piece white or dark or half or whole chicken. It is cooked so well it blew me away. I had heard about how good it was before I arrived but was still amazed.   What an awesome restaurant in the heart of NoDa. If you haven't you need to stop and try this place out. They have plenty of sides that you can't all try at once and will leave you coming back for more.",

And lastly, the chicken and waffles: overly breaded, needed salt badly, and the waffle was a somehow rock hard on the outside, and gummy in the middle. Not sure why people seem to like this place. Save your self the trouble if you want fried chicken, visit the Shell Station on East Blvd. Cool atmosphere, would go for drinks but not for food, especially lunch.",

We started with cheese straws.  Normally I don't like things like that because they taste fake cheesy, but these did not.  They were very good.  I shared a ton of sides and all were great: Kale grits-one of my favorites Carrots w/ goat cheese - a special that night, good glad I tried it  mac 'n cheese- it is mac 'n cheese it is delish corn bread pudding-definitely would get again brussel sprout salad special-this was good and I love garlic but it was a little too garlicy for me  I wouldn't go here if I was trying to eat healthy, but it was great comfort food!",

Some of the best fried chicken this side of Price's Chicken Coop!  As good as the chicken was, the sides were possibly the highlight.  We ordered mac & cheese (wouldn't get again, simply because it was the weakest of the bunch, but if you must, go for it!), kale grits (OMGG! O Maizing Green Grits), okra with enough bacon jam that it's approved by the Pork Council as a meat, sweet potato dumplings (some said they were a little on the salty side, which they were, but still the highlight for me), kale salad (sounds blah but try it and you'll change your mind), and tater tots (smaller than most other places, but it packs a flavorful punch).  The Alabama white sauce is good for dipping, as is the house made hot sauce (which is not overly hot btw).  A friend got the special, which was chicken and biscuits (described as chicken pot pie filling over 4 biscuits). A very large portion but it looked amazing.  I had too much food in front of me to try, but everyone said it was good.  The beer selection was a little weak for me, but still enough options to find something.  They certainly push the mixed drinks and wine as opposed to the beer menu.  I stuck with beer but a few folks at the table had mixed drinks and all were pleased with their orders.  2 beers, an order of 2 piece chicken, and a side had me out of the door for $30 after tip.    We were there by 5:30 on a Tuesday and had no wait.  However, the place was packed out by 6:30.  As others note, there is a waitlist option on the Yelp app, so save yourself some stress and take care of that before arriving.  Walk down the street to any one of several bars for a pre-dinner drink, or just hang out in the bar and run up your tab.  Whatever you decide, just decide that this place is worth the wait!",

    "text": "Overall really liked this place! We did order way too much, portion sizes are pretty big. Appetizers the hush puppies are good but need to be served with some sort of sipping sauce, I had to lather on the butter so they weren't too dry. Butter was really good though. Pimento cheese, it was ok. I felt it was a little bland and the simple saltine crackers were underwhelming. Biscuits good but need to be served with that awesome butter or once again super dry. Meals! Got the breast and wing and OMG the chicken was huge. Literally two ppl could have split it. But the fried chicken was really awesome, crispy, juicy and lots of flavor. Mac and cheese was ok, it had a gritty texture. Didn't like the sweet potato gnocchi, just had an overwhelming flavor I didn't care for and would not order again. Tater tots were our favorite for sure! Clearly we ordered too much but wanted to try a little bit of everything so tons of food to take home. As for service used the no wait app and timing was spot on! Server was good at first but once our food was served never came back to check in. Finally got boxes and again had to wait so long for check my husband just went tracked her down to pay. I knocked off a star for service unfortunately. Especially because we came at 9pm so wasn't like we wanted to have a long drawn out dinner. Overall would come again and now know what I like but not sure if it's worth the 90min wait.",

Both their fried chicken and chicken tenders were a lot juicier. We also ended up ordering the pimento cheese ball, okra, and mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok but everything else was fantastic. Looking forward to future visits!",
