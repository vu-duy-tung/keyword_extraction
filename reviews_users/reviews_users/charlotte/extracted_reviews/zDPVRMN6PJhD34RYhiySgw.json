My first impression was that it's very nice inside and the staff was very friendly. However they had very slow service and not many people were seated. We got our food and my husbands chicken was over cooked and dry. I had ordered the fish tacos and they were very good in taste however I noticed something crunchy. I wasn't sure if it was bones or what but I ended up not eating them. I was dissappointed because this restuarant was so close to our home and there's not that many Mexican restaurants near to our home. I will probably try this place again but order something different.",

We had tacos, nachos, homemade chicken soup (to die for) and huevos con chorizo. Everything was superb and very reasonably priced. To top off the wonderful dining experience we met Edgar who periodically checked on us to ensure we were experiencing a pleasant dining experience. Muchas Gracias!",

Tried out the new location tonight and was very pleased. We got a table right away and had chips and salsa immediately. Their salsa is so good that I used to get it to go for any time I was making Mexican at home and it's just as going at this location. Our server was attentive and pleasant and our food was delivered quickly, hot and delicious. I had the taco, burrito, enchilada combo and my hubby got a chicken fajita salad (not on the menu but they made it for him). If you like good, basic Mexican food, you will love this place as much as I do. Two thumbs up!!",

Price is reasonable. They have a full bar and offer lower prices on drink specials from time to time. Chips and salsa delivered immediately. Two salsas are given, one mild and one hot. Large beverage glasses so you don't have to ask for refills all the time. Our food server brought refills without our need to ask. Very attentive. Another employee, Edgar, came to see how we were doing. He is very personable and is an asset to this restaurant. The lower rating is because of the noise level. With tile floors and open space we found it to be noisy and difficult to converse. I suggest that they lower the music to help minimize this problem. Good food, so give it a try.",

The food was inedible, it made me sick (as in food poisoning?). The young man who answered the phone refused to refund our money unless my much older husband would bring the food back. I'm from NYC and no, I don't drive. There was no way they were going to get away with their \"take out crap\". So I put the husband on the road with the disgusting, inedible food. It was the WORST handling of a situation like this I've ever dealt with. I kept asking for this guy's supervisor, he kept saying he WAS the supervisor. \"Not in the business of giving away free food\". Was that a professional, decent answer? We'd ordered from them before. So 73 year old husband got on the road late night and returned the pig slop that usually comes as \"take out\". My NJ sister in law said \"never order take out, it's always crap! Wish I listened to her. So we got our refund (according to my credit card). After all the \"H\" I/we had to deal with, wouldn't ever deal with this restaurant which by the way can't keep their name staight. . .they answer the phone \"La Unica\" but now call themselves \"La Autentica\".  I call them \"La B.S.\"",

I have no idea what kind of cheese they use, but it does not go well with enchiladas nor quesadillas. I had cheese enchiladas and I couldn't finish them. I noticed the same problem with the cheese at the other location in Indian Trail, but I still decided to give this location a try. I will not be returning for food. However, I may consider returning only for a casual night to have drinks and watch some sports. The ambience does look good for a good sports night. This place is loaded with huge TVs all around.",

La Unica definitely serves REAL Mexican food. There are authentic offerings to on the menu, and even more important, authentic taste that hit the table. Their chorizo dip is incredible by the way.

Service is good, and their location is ok since they are hidden in a small shopping mall.  I'll keep trying other restaurants in the area.  Like I said, good people working there, but, their food needs to improve dramatically.",

    "text": "This could very well be a one-star rating, but it was our first time here and I generally give three-stars if it is A-OK; but La Unica (the only one in English) just might be the only one that came across that way...in a negative sense.  Newly opened we went for lunch.  It was 1pm, so the lunch mob had vacated and there was just one table of six Latinos finishing and two other tables occupied.  Seated, we waited for 15 minutes until our waiter came to our table.  The long wait was a surprise as there were at least four wait persons wandering around, but I guess assigned tables are just that.  The menu looked pretty good.  Lots of selections broken down by category, a lunch menu, a drink menu and a listing of sides.  Pretty much an array you would expect from a Mexican/Latino restaurant.  Attractive and interesting.  We begged off the waiter who came back for more time to read the menu.  Big mistake as he was gone for quite a bit of time.  While gone from our table a couple of ladies were seated nearby, at one of his tables, as he was right on top of their order, got their drinks and did respond to our waving of arms and approached our table to take our order.  Another long wait.  By now it was 1:35 and we were thinking of leaving.  I ordered the Speedy Gonzales special (ironic given how long we languished at our table!).  This was a carnita taco, a cheese enchalada and beans.  You have a choice of beans or rice, and it is extra if you want both.  Wife ordered another special of a chili rellano with beans.  We both had iced tea and those were $2.65 each.  Should have gone for booze!  Again a long wait for the order to appear.  The table with the two women already had their order served while we waited.  They had ordered after we did.  The slow kitchen confirmed to my wife and I that the theme of La Unica was the word \"slow.\"  The food was so-so.  My taco was a room temperature corn tortilla with dry pork pieces and a bit of lettuce.  The encilada just lay dead on the plate, cheese had already solidified and their red sauce was more like a chipolte flavored canned sauce.    Wife's chili rellano was pretty good.  Stuffed with cheese, that was melted, and the chili was not heavily breaded.  Excellent.    We both agreed that their beans were very good.  Not totally mashed into paste like found in many Latino restaurants, these were partially mashed but leaving a good amount of beans whole.  And they were flavorful.  Go for the beans v. rice.  We paid at 2:16pm, so the uncrowded lunch took over an hour.  Oddly, we noticed that our receipt showed that we paid at 1:16pm or maybe that was when our waiter took our drink order?  Our neighbors, along with some of the Yelpers rating, gave this place raves.  This is just NOT a five-star experience which equals \"as good as it gets.\"  Golly!  At least one Yelper did mention how slow they were.  We will give it another chance, but I just hate to think that I might pay for another less than satisfactory experience.",

Tonight really took it to a new level of absurdity though.  To avoid the saddened face of a child that looks like we just broke their favorite toy, we have learned to check our order EVERY time before we leave the parking lot. 5 orders called in: Order # 1 - WRONG Order # 2 - WRONG Order # 3 - WRONG Order # 4 - WRONG Order # 5 - Wait, how did this happen....it's actually what I ordered! Oh, but no Chips and salsa were ready to go. We had to ask. After numerous attempts to correct the order we still ended up with a missing entree in the end after arriving home.  Called the restaurant in the hopes they would make things right.  While it took some time they offered a full refund.  Queue hubby to go pick it up.  Enter restaurant, give name and gentleman (manager?) is waved over.  He casually asks if cash was OK, to which I responded, Yes.  A $20 bill is handed to me.  I don't move, but look at the register and say 'full refund' was promised.  Employees are called in for a \"huddle\" as they all look at each other confused.  A full refund is begrudgingly handed over with shaking heads and negative looks from the huddle.   That's it for me! I'm out!  Damn shame as the food is good, but can't deal with the terrible service any more.",

We had friends suggest this place because they knew how much we enjoy a good ceviche and it did not disappoint. Super fresh tasting and the portion size is just amazing. In fact, we normally end up taking a to-go box home and enjoying again the next day sitting poolside. But it's not only the ceviche....the tacos are phenomenal as well!!! And of course, the one thing that is a make or break is the chips and salsa....theirs is just perfect. You get a mild and a hot version with their crunchy, corny chips. Simply perfect! And the icing on the proverbial cake is cold Juicy Jay on tap at a very reasonable price. Go try this place and support this spot. It seems this space has been jinxed in the past, as many different restaurants have come and gone....let's make this one a permanent fixture. Cheers!",

My wife and I eat A LOT of salsa when we go for Mexican food and loved that this place brings out the large carafe of salsa so we don't have to ask 100 times for more salsa. It was also very tasty salsa, which is probably one of the most important things at a Mexican restaurant.  I had chicken fajitas for the main meal and my wife had a combo. The fajitas were very good, and I loved that they weren't all greasy like some other places. Plus they were a large portion for the price with some leftover for tomorrow. I had a few bites of my wife's combo and it was also delicious. The ground beef had a great flavor and wasn't super salty.   The service was also great, the wait staff was very friendly and helped in every way possible. The new owner was previously at La Unica in Matthews, which is also very good. He's super friendly and always has a smile on his face.  If you are looking for a good Mexican spot or love salsa like we do, this is a great spot to try!",

They're very simple, served open faced on a soft tortilla with only your choice of meat, cilantro and onions. No cheese, tomatoes or anything else.  I went with three shredded chicken, a shredded beef and a pork. They were all perfectly savory. Will be back (next Tuesday).",

    "text": "You must get the Margaritas!   Imagine this: It's Friday, you've had a long week and so has your husband. All you want to do is go out to dinner and relax. You decide on La Authentica.  You walk in,  and ask if there is a warmer section of the restaurant you can sit in because  you're chilly. The hostess and your husband both look at you like...what? And you realize you're being ridiculous and the hostess is being very nice. You're offered a seat outside but you'd rather be inside.   You and your husband are immediately seated at a booth and you order some guacamole,  you get some chips and salsa as well and you order 2 frozen margaritas.  The margaritas are huge and they are strong and delicious. The chips are warm and the guacamole and salsa are great.   You're getting buzzed after only a few sips as you realize you've made the right choice for a Friday night-- a very important decision. At this point,  not much can go wrong.  Especially when you realize those huge margaritas were only about 5 or 6$ a piece.   The chips and guacamole and salsa are plenty and you are just enjoying yourself.  And then,  you order some fajitas and some tacos. And the waitress is super sweet. The food comes and tastes fresh,  but you can't finish it.  So,  you get boxes.   Obviously you left some room for dessert.  So you order tres leches and it's a huge slice and you finish it sooo quickly because its absolutely delicious!!  And then you ask for the check and everything you ordered is only 56$ and you're happy.  And you leave full,  buzzed and relaxed with left overs.  Perfect end to a long week.  Now that's a perfect Happy Friday!",

    "text": "Of all the Mexican restaurants in the Ballantyne area, La Autentica is far and away my favorite. This is the third, maybe fourth, restaurant in what has been a seemingly problematic location for businesses. I've been to La Autentica probably a dozen more times than my visits to all the prior restaurants combined.  The food is excellent. Their lunch portion of Tacos de Asada is perfect and includes rice and beans. The first photo shown on Yelp is actually one of my photos of their Tacos de Asada from one of my early visits. The tacos are authentic \"Mexican street tacos\"; two soft corn tortillas, tender bites of steak, cilantro and onions. Simple food, but delicious.  Upon arrival you'll be brought two red salsas in small carafes, one spicy (it's the one with more of the pepper's seeds showing) and a more mild salsa. I like to combine the two to blend a salsa with a hint of a kick. Ask for their salsa verde as well, and you'll be brought out a small carafe of a spicy green salsa with bits of avocado in it. It's also delicious, although it's become much hotter since they opened. I prefer it a little milder, but it tastes so good I plow through it anyway, much to the dismay of my stomach.  I've never had bad service here during lunch and it's been pretty consistent for dinner with only a couple of early misses. I tried the quesadilla on my first visit and was unimpressed, so switched to the tacos on my next visit and haven't looked back.  I'm docking one star simply because getting delivery or takeout from La Autentica is hit or miss. I've ordered via Door Dash and over the phone and I've run into issues each time. Ordering via Door Dash, you have to purchase chips and salsa for a few bucks. That on top of the delivery charge makes it not worthwhile, especially when, after paying a few extra bucks for chips and salsa, they skimp on the salsa and chips included in the order.  We tried ordering directly via phone, and asking for the chips and salsa with our order, and weren't charged, which is nice. However, there were other issues.. Their \"lunch\" tacos de asada comes with rice and beans and two tacos. The dinner portion is three tacos, no rice or beans. You can order the \"lunch portion\" at dinner, for a dollar more, but it's confusing. When I ordered over the phone directly, I specified the lunch portion but got the version without the rice or beans, which wasn't what I was looking for at all. My husband went back to get some refried beans (I had just had a tooth extracted, could barely eat anything and was SO looking forward to the beans that night) and they gave him a hard time, but they were busy on a weekend night.  Now when we want carryout, we go to the restaurant in person and place our order with the menu in front of us so there's no discrepancy. It's an inconvenient step to have to take, but the food is worth it, and in person everything works out much better!",

My spouse had the fajitas and they seemed to be okay (not like what we've experience before at other places where they come out from the kitchen sizzling). Never-the-less, both entrees were very good.   The place was not crowded when we got there (before the lunch crowd), but by the time we left a fair number of people also came in. Prices were good and service was good as well. We would definitely go back!",

Really enjoyed the al pastor and carnitas, but not so much everything else. When I ordered, the waitress mentioned that we were required to order drinks in order to get the $1 Taco Tuesday deal. Neither of us drink sodas or teas so ordered drinks, but barely touched them. I rather they put a minimum on number of tacos you have to get since we thought the drinks were just a waste. Also wasn't a fan of the service. I had to get up several times to request more chips, ask for to-go containers, etc. Think I rather stick to my other taco Tuesday favorites but may come back to try the other dishes.",

They also have a green salsa (which is super spicy) that you can ask for (no charge) which has avocado chunks in it as well.  They have the best tasting chimichanga!  I always get the chicken chimichanga because it's SOO delicious!  It's always so fresh that it tastes healthy!
