Of course this isn't an everyday meal... certainly not cheap or healthy. But I'll absolutely make it a point to go back and try more items next time I visit the Charlotte area.  Or maybe I won't... I mean the mac and shrimp stand on their own.",

The bf and I walked in an hour before closing, wish they opened closer to Uptown...not a fan of the location, a little dark and shady. I recommend CALLing IN AHEAD FOR PICK UP, we waited for a while for the food to be done. The staff was nice but, the wait for the food was not. We ordered a 1/2 lobster mac, chicken and the red velvet waffle, and a side of seasoned fries. The food was delicious! That lobster mac was so creamy, seasoned, and laden generously with juicy lobster bits. My favorite, I could eat a whole order by myself I bet...your calorie counting body will not thank you but, your taste buds sure will. The seasoned fries were crunchy but, a little dry. My bf scarfed his chicken and waffles down, The waffle was nice and fluffy, and spot on with the red velvet taste. The chicken tenders with cajun dry rub were a little on the chewy side but, still tasted good.   I'd definitely come back here, but will be calling ahead for pickup. You will be waiting there for your food for a very long time if not.",

The cucumber lemonade was delicious.   *I will change my stars after waiting a good bit before returning for a chance to work of the kinks.",

THE best lobster mac I have ever had. I was most impressed because it took no time for them to fix my order. Considering it was fish, I assumed it must've been premade and sitting under a heat lamp. I expected for it to be Luke warm. I was Wrong. After driving to Target, I opened my container and everything was Hot and fresh. Very impressed! Then there was the mac and cheese. It was creamy, flavorful, and there I was scarfing down a whole meal in a parking lot. There were several chunks of lobster meat. At the price point, I'm not sure how they do it. I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.  I came back about a week later and the cook/owner wasn't there. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but my lemon pepper wings were great AND they had 3 drums/ 3 flats. Management assured me they're addressing consistency w/ m&c. Not sure if they take special request with wings, but I'm cool with it being even.  Needless to say, I'll be driving across town to return to Cuzzo's to get the mac and cheese. I'm rooting for them to open a second location sooner than later.",

Don't let that discourage you cause when i tell u this place has heart. It has heart. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and when i say \"bussing\". It was amazing. Not your traditional Mac, but it was good! I also ordered 10 of the 1/2 jerk 1/2 lemon pepper. They were on point. When your looking for some food with soul. Go check out Cuzzo's. This is now one of my top places and the customer service is top tier. I will be telling my friend to tell a friend because this place is dope. Good food and even better vibes. Keep up the good work!",

So he told them hold on why I go ask my girl....and since we had drove 20 mins to get the lobster Mac and cheese I said well let's just order it to go. He called to place a to go order, and before he finished with saying I need to place a to go order....they said all you prepared to pay over the phone as well. Huh???? I'm confused I never been to or order to go from a restaurant that asks you to pay over the phone as well before even placing your order! Not that we couldn't pay over the phone but WHY is that the only option when you place a to go order WHY can't I pay cash when I get their to pick up my food and make sure it's right first!!! Never again! I'm big on customer service and not doing shit the ghetto way!!!! Please do better....",

The fish tacos hurt my feelings. They just didn't hit. Maybe I'm used to local favorites like cabo fish taco or Pinkys fish tacos. They were just....bland. Like a giant fish stick on a tortilla (I'm sorry). Thank goodness for that cilantro, it helps. Maybe another smudge of the sauce or even a course slaw would make it perfect. However, the rest of the food was so good that I'm still gonna return!  Customer service: VERY PLEASANT. Felt like I was among family Ambiance: kinda absent but the vibe is still pleasantly relaxing with upbeat jazz playing in the background. Try it, you'll love it!",

I ordered the wings and lobster Mac, I chose jerk sauce as my flavor. My girlfriend had the wings, shrimp and fries plate. After ordering we were told it would take about 30 minutes for our food. An hour later (yes an entire hour later) we FINALLY got our food! For the price, location, wait time, and establishment the food was OK at best. The shrimp was not seasoned well, the fries were over seasoned and the lobster Mac was full of grease! Literally grease covered the bottom of my tray from the lobster Mac. The wings were cooked perfectly (so that was a plus). My jerk sauce taste more like BBQ sauce and had absolutely no spice to it. Overall the food was ok, honestly nothing to brag about. I only rated 3 stars because one of the workers tried to make up for the long wait by offering us a free drink! The Lemonade was the best thing I've tasted I would definitely go back for the lemonade, NOT the food!!",

    "text": "I am in debt to that yelper who posted a photo of her lunch a few weeks ago, bringing my attention to this new restaurant and prompting a mental note for a future visit.  Decided to take the 20min drive to experience their lauded lobster mac & cheese. Arrived around 11:20am Thursday. Redevelopment is slowly making it's way down Tuckaseegee Rd, yet based on the address, I doubted it had gotten that far down yet. Was looking forward to supporting the organic efforts of a few forward-thinking souls in bringing a fresh new business to this area.  Pulled in to the well maintained parking lot. Walked in to a well-lit and clean restaurant, and was instantly greeted by a young man at the counter. I was the only customer at the time, yet somehow the place still had an energy of fullness and life. After some jovial chatting, decided on a 1/2 lb order.   Taking a seat, the owner came out and greeted me very genuinely, all smiles and warmth. I mentioned I watched a cooking segment of his on TV, and a pleasant conversation proceeded from there. I really hoped the food would be good.  The lobster mac & cheese was indeed good. I should disclose that this was my first time ever having lobster mac & cheese, as I am a devout crab mac & cheese-er. Lobster is so subtly sweet & light tasting that I think it's flavor gets a little lost in a dish like mac & cheese. Thus, I think I arrived with misplaced flavor expectations. Crab mac & cheese comes at you bold; lobster mac & cheese is more discreet & refined. There were lots of chunks of lobster, and it was all marvelously fresh. Totally worth the drive.  For dessert, I had Banana Strawberry Pudding. Growing up, wars of mastery were fought at family reunions over banana pudding, so when the manager praised his version, I had no choice. Sure enough, it was splendid.  Cuzzos Cuisine is a fantastic addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene. Lots of customers piled in after me, and it was clear they have a lot of regulars. Even the local mailman was there. Grateful for it's presence, customer service, and quality of food, and look forward to watching it rise.",

(my type of music). A quiet atmosphere. I started to browse the menu and the same lady that greeted me helped me order. She explained the menu and educated me on what I should get since I was a first timer. I chose the shrimp and fish with lobster mac. Also ordered the kumelon drink. She also explained the point system to me for every dollar I spend I get a point .. the points add up and you can get 10% off . Good to know because I plan on coming back. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are good. Next time I will not be coming alone . Definitely will be bringing a crowd of people next time around . Food was A1.  #supportingBlackBusinesses #greatFood  #evenBetterPeople.",

    "text": "I try to support Black-owned businesses. This one I raved about after seeing an invite for their restaurant site grand opening on Facebook about 3 months ago. Even took a picture w/ the owner and urged my family members to go...which they did and we made it a monthly, even bimonthly (at times) family meal outing. So, when I saw that they \"were\" a participating restaurant on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> and that the site had a deal going on for cyber Monday, I jumped to it...again, even reached out to family members to purchase certificates...which my sister did as well! I called to make sure they would honor my deal, but they have no recollection of it. Even spoke to Curtis who spoke w/ one of the managers who stated they would honor my certificate. However when I got to the restaurant, claimed 1 of 4 of my certificates, all of a sudden the best they could give me is 25% off. I clearly stated over the phone what the deal was (purchase $50 of food and get $25 off). He said NOTHING about 25% off over the phone...his direct words were \"yes we will honor it\". I proceed to drive to the restaurant to show them what I was referring to...mind you again, I claimed my certificate. The hostess w/ curly natural hair, glasses who was wearing a striped top took my order, but I asked her not to place it until the owner spoke w/ a representative from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> asking when/why/how were they apart of their organization without having consented. As I waited other staff members made their way to the front as one of them (a light skinned/white lady in a white chef coat and black hat w/her hair in a back bun) kept glancing my way. It was obvious that they were discussing my situation as the girl who took my order, the one w/ the curly natural hair w/ glasses and a striped shirt made the remarks to her coworkers \"it was just $2). After speaking w/ the manager, I made it clear to the hostess (in front of management) that \"if you're going to talk about your customers, the better thing to do would be to do it away from them or after they leave, but while they're there is so unprofessional.\" My demeanor was perfectly fine and even if the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> situation couldn't have been resolved, I still would have placed an order because I USED to love their service & business. The food is amazing, but customer service & the discretion/interaction you have with your customer supercedes if they'll return. This customer will not! Check your first point of contacts!",

Myself and a friend were the second and third persons thru the door for lunch. We ordered at counter, both of us selecting the fried shrimp and lobster Mac & cheese. I also ordered the strawberry banana pudding, shared, and a take-out of ten wings, BBQ and jerk. Let me tell u, that lobster Mac&cheese is on point! Super creamy, firm and full of flavor! Yummmmy! The shrimp was fried to perfection and large, plump and delish. The strawberry banana pudding was cold and fresh. Nice spin on the ordinary. The wings were delicious as well, even after reheating at home. The kmelon drink was beyond words!!!. Will go back just for that. The owner actually came out to bring my order to the counter. I shook his hand and congratulated him on his restaurant concept. He was smiling broadly and for a moment I was mesmerized, off my game(Wassup!!). Check out the wall of celebs near the back booths, impressive. Can't wait to go back.",

I had jerk wings, red beans & rice. On my most recent visit, I had the same but I added the lobster mac & cheese. I love the jerk flavored wings which has a hint of sweetness, a pinch of heat that doesn't linger on your pallet too long. The red beans & rice was flavorful & seemed to pair well with the wings & M&C. The M&C was cheesy, bold, & very unique. I really enjoyed this side however think it would taste that much better if real lobster was included. I'd pay the up charge! Overall, this is a restaurant I will continue to frequent & has become a staple of the local Charlotte area community. I see why.",

Our lobster mac and cheese was seasoned well, but there was not one piece of lobster in the dish.  We were disappointed because that dish was the main reason for going there.

I tasted more of the butter instead of the the lobster & Cheese. Some of the pasta was uncooked and some was over cooked.  At least the shrimp was cooked perfect and seasoned great. The tarter sauce wasn't really Cajun but it was ok.   The homemade lemonade was delicious. Should have order one to go.",

The Lobster Mac and Cheese is Orgasmic. Came on Sunday, they have it setup buffet style. All the food was very delicious, the yams tasted like candy so good! I don't usually like greens but I liked the greens here. The chicken was finger licking good. They also have sweet tea which is one of my favorites. All around this place was bomb. Felt so full after I was done eating yet I was still craving more. Hats of to the chef. It was a pleasure coming here. I will be back hopefully sooner than later.",

    "text": "So I'll start out by saying, I was a little skeptical of coming here after hearing a number of mixed reviews. I work literally 3mins down the street, but was too nervous to try it, until recently!! I decided to try it and was PLEASANTLY surprised!! I walked in around 12noon and noticed that the music was a little loud for a lunchtime crowd, more fitting for a party atmosphere. People were yelling over the music to place their order and talk to each other as they ate. I would suggest turning the music down a smidge, to create more of a pleasurable experience for guests. I was greeted by the staff and they were very friendly and helpful, as I had no clue what I was in the mood for! I ordered the fried shrimp and lobster Mac n cheese, along with a Kumelon (cucumber melon pink lemonade). My food came out within about 10 mins and I headed back to work. When I got back, I was blown away by the flavor!! I was told that the lobster Mac n cheese lacked the lobster but this wasn't the case for me! I had the perfect lobster/mac ratio! The shrimp was fried to perfection and the portion was excellent! I would definitely recommend it!!  During my second visit, they were running a special and I ordered the lemon pepper wings, lobster Mac n cheese, and cinnamon chips for $10. I ordered my lunch over the phone before heading to work and was 15mins away when I placed my ordered. When I got there, I still had to wait another 15 mins before my food was ready but the staff was very apologetic about the long wait and offered a free drink because of the inconvenience. I would encourage everyone to try it for yourself!! You won't be disappointed!",

First I'll start with the good: The staff were very personable and helpful. They were friendly and appeared as if they enjoyed being there. The lobster mac... wow.... the lobster mac. Never had it before, but I need more of it in my life.  The bad: The area where I was sitting seemed a bit cramped. It wasn't a deal breaker, but I was almost tempted to eat in my car. The chicken wings were fried hard. I know there are some people that like that (for some reason), however I am not one of them. Tender and flavorful is the name of the game for me when it comes to wings. Because of the texture of the wings, I could not enjoy them. They were edible, but I ate them because I paid for them.   Either way, it was a pretty good first visit. I probably wont get the wings again but the menu was full of other things I'm curious to try. But I WILL be getting more of the lobster mac, that pretty much goes without saying. If you're in the area, check them out.",

Finally, things got slow at work and I fought my way through the cat calls to the safety of their four walls.   \"Welcome to cuzzos\" the cashier said as I walked through the door. My eyes were big and my stomach was ready, shrimp, wings, tenders, lobster Mac and cheese... I wanted it all! But I had talk myself down, I have a waistline and a wallet to be considerate of. So, I chose the lobster Mac and cheese and tenders.    They are not very fast and to be honest, my portion was a little smaller than I anticipated. The tenders were kinda skimpy but they tasted good. The Mac and cheese was everything I could have hoped for and the lobster isn't \"too much\" but nicely added in there.   You can add a sauce to your tenders, the bbq looks like mild but it tastes good. There's room to eat in here but most people were taking their food to go. It comes in little black containers that can be reused to that's useful. I'll definitely be back to explore more menu options.  Oh, they offer 10% off for students!",

Seriously, if you are looking for a rich, indulgent, throw your diet to the wind type of place...Cuzzo's is it! So good! And, the jumbo shrimp are perfectly crispy. You MUST try the CuMelon Lemonade- a perfect compliment to any of their dishes.  The food is good, but the service is better. When you enter Cuzzo's you are greeted with a welcome, smile and excellent service. The staff are friendly and personable. You can tell that staff make a habit of learning the names and orders of regular patrons. I noticed that many staff referred to guests by name and many guests greeted staff by name.   The owner has created a great atmosphere including a spotless facility (I love to see tables cleared and cleaned quickly in a dining space), jazz  playing in the background, and ample seating.  As much as I wanted to try dessert, I simple could not. The portions are quite large and left me full for most of the day.   I will certainly return for brunch! Right after I lose the 5 pounds gained from the mac.",

I read all the reviews, my hubby was dying to try it so we gave it a go. We arrived at 6:15 on a Saturday, got to the counter to order and before we said a thing the cashier said it's an hour and a half wait on ALL food.  WTH.  Right then I wanted to leave but my hubby wanted to wait it out. We waited. Now mind you, we're at a table, their drinks are bottled so you can't even have a drink while you wait unless you purchase multiple bottles.  We ordered wings (hot), fries, chicken tenders, and the lobster mac & cheese.  At 7:25 our food is ready.  Sigh. I'm literally dying.  I had tenders and mac.  The tenders weren't breaded they were covered and I do mean COVERED in seasoning salt.  If anyone eats there more than once in their life they will need blood pressure meds for sure. OMG.  The mac n cheese was good, though.  I was just so put off by the chicken that I couldn't finish my food.  My daughters picked over their food while my husband tried to save face and eat everything. Long story short, I wouldn't go back.  As much as I wanted to like it, I didn't.",

I am actually feeling some type of way that I've been living in Charlotte and just went today.  I did the dine-in brunch buffet option. So let's move right along to everything I had on my plate. The yams..listen!! I don't know whose garden these yams are growing in and how they cook them to perfection but these are the best I ever had (no exaggeration). The yams are coated with sweetness but still firm. No mushiness around these parts! I love how the collards have a sweet taste yet a well seasoned kick to them. The cabbage has a vinegar taste to them but it's weird because it isn't strong and the taste it still just right. The cajun chicken....oh my...I don't want anybody else's chicken anymore except Cuzzo's. I'm on a chicken strike!!! Everybody needs a little rice on their plate so the rice met standards. I don't like macaroni and cheese but the lobster mac & cheese is a must try. I loved the cajun taste it had going on. I think that covered my plate.Ohhh, don't forget your cornbread!!! Nice and moist!  I hope by now you've stopped your car, got off the boat, or whatever you are doing and made it to Cuzzo's!! See you there!",

After my card was swiped I was told that it would be about 30 minutes. I'm thinking it was lunch hour there is no way they are really taking 30 minutes to give people their food so I waited. It took the full 30 minutes and I was a little upset because my plan was to sit down and enjoy my good but ended up having to take it with me. Told myself I would never go back on my lunch break again...until I tried the food. The lobster Mac and cheese was AMAZING! It has just the right amount of spice to it. I really could have just gotten a plate full of lobster Mac and been just fine! The shrimp were also delicious they were seasoned to perfection! The wings were just okay. They were seasoned well but were cooked a little too hard for my liking. I will definitely go back and will wait just for that lobster Mac and cheese! I also can't wait to try other things on the menu since I ended up really enjoying the food. Subtracted one star for the long wait but like I said the food was worth a little extra wait time in my opinion, at least it didn't taste rushed.",

This restaurant is in the middle of a lower middle to low income area that is getting closer and closer to gentrification daily (think NoDa) so I hope they stick around. Parking is directly in front of the restaurant and wasn't a hassle. There is also plenty of space inside to eat.   I ordered Cajun wings with a side of their famous lobster macaroni and cheese. While the wait time was longer than I wanted, my food was HOT. The wings were really good, fried perfectly! The lobster mac was good. It was well seasoned and was a good portion.   Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and great food. Definitely a great addition to Charlotte.",

Love the fact that the shrimp is lightly battered versus the heavily, which tends to be greasy. Lobster mac was very creamy and had  an okay amount for lobster pieces. It was appropriately  priced  and we will check out the brick and mortar in the near future. For the food truck, seems like only one is preparing. May suggest someone box and the other prepare to speed this popular stop along. Will say the young lady taking orders was very personable. She  smiled and even apologized for the wait. She also typed and accepted tender with quick efficiency. She gets 5 stars.",

Has seating for about 20 people inside, everything is made to order so wait time is about 15-20 mins. They make this known with signs everywhere. When paying with a debit or credit card you must show ID that has the same name on it, which in the age of scammers this is a total positive for me. They have signs that state that as well. And the same applies when ordering over the phone and pick up. I suggest if you have a problem with the whole ID thing is pay in cash.  Staff are friendly and what I love about it is the blackness of the clientele and the Diversity of it all. When I went there were elderly folks, college students, families, single folks. It was awesome to see.  Along with my chicken tacos, I also got a Kumelon Sweet tea.  The chicken tacos were good and were still warm when I got home with them. They are simple tacos, cheese, meat, tomato and a chipotle sauce. Not authentic obviously but still delicious. And of course the Kumelon was great.",

Everyone said \"it's worth the wait\".  I ordered then ran a few errands, came back after about 50 and the food was ready in about ten minutes after I returned.  FYI - Door dash picks up from here and may be a better option.  The funny thing is the restaurant is full of tables and chairs but everyone sitting is simply waiting on their food.  Not actually eating at the tables.  To go seems to b the preferred option.  My family and I ordered an assortment of food.  Non of which is worthy of mentioning once you taste the lobster Mac.  By far, this is the best thing I tasted and I'd assume it's the best thing on the entire menu.  Of you go, go for the lobster mac!!",

    "text": "In Charlotte visiting my sister-in-law and we were getting mani/pedis together when our nail techs started talking about a place called Cuzzo's that had the best Southern food they'd ever had. They described the best lobster mac n cheese they'd ever had and if we were looking for a place with great food to check them out. So post mani/pedis we were off to Cuzzo's to indulge in the succulent food we'd heard described.   Upon arrival, mid afternoon, there weren't many people in front of us and we checked out the menu. A self-proclaimed shrimp and grits connoisseur, I had to order theirs, especially since I haven't had any since I moved West. I also ordered a 1/2 pound side of the lobster mac n cheese. My sister ordered the fish shrimp and grits. I also got the Kumelon \"Prickly Pear\" drink.   We waited like 10-15 mins for our food and then our names were called and we were served our food in to-go plates (sidenote: all of their food is packaged to-go, even if you're dining in) I'm grateful that it was piping hot when it came out and so worth the drive. I truly enjoyed the shrimp and grits, I usually turn my nose to shrimp and grits without red sauce but it was so savory and down home. They also serve it with plenty of shrimp! I have never had shrimp and grits were the grits were that seasoned, but wow these were incredible!! My sister's fish was incredible salty though, like a vat of salt was poured on it. It kinda ruined her shrimp and grits.   BUT THAT LOBSTER MAC N CHEESE WAS WOW WOW WOW! They have that thang down. It was perfectly seasoned, cheesy, tender lobster. It's mouthwateringly amazing. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life. They lived up to their \"World Famous\" name.   Overall we really enjoyed our visit and will be back. Next time I'm going to try out the wings with the mac n cheese.  Go!",

    "text": "I've waited and do believe they have enough healthy scores for my truth.   Service:  Shawn saves the place and should remain front house or backhouse  mgr while training others to do hee job. She makes the 4.5 star level. I hate the whole you've got to give your credit card over the phone, but I do like they have the online system to text or Email receipts.   Food: 3 stars. The fish and shrimp saves it for me. *Meant to try the waffles, wings, beans  No luck just yet.  *Quality fish and it's not fried hard so you'll have to ask for that.  *No catfish which I adore. I gave it up.  *** This isn't semantics it's just a fact. The mac & cheese has Langostino. Lobster is buttery. Langostino is akin like a cousin parallel to crawfish being in the family. Red Lobster was sued for this misnomer usage. I don't expect a small business to do as Red Lobster, yet disclosures are most helpful with the allergens that are prominent. ****  Delivery/DoorDash: 3.5 stars Placed order via Doordash  as I prefer to ordering online versus waiting in person and holding the line to give my cc over the phone. See pickup time? Arrived to wait 19more minutes per the counter. See screenshot  time on latest photo.     Calling In: give it up. 1st of the month, Fridays, weekends - nearly impossible to get through except Sundays because of the buffet.   Pricing: although business is robust the prices are increasing. Idk  what to tell ya. I didn't ask for an answer.    I've got 5-7 minutes based on that adjustment I was told about upon asking. There seems to be a designated \"pick up\" area now and the 2 cashiers are only for ringing up orders not even checking to see if your online/call in is ready. This may be attributed to they know the actual wait time. Again, idk but maybe I'll try again in a few months.   It's a better wait than some other local FUBU  places in town.",

Fresh off the highway I was told this is the place to stop for a quick eats. It's a small place in a big parking lot. But after a few mins I understood why. Cars came pouring in which just leaked my interest.   Tried the fish tacos and the world famous lobster Mac and cheese and everything was really quite good. Not sure about world famous, couldn't really find the lobster. But def really tasty.   Shrimp tacos were on point. Also very flavorful and delicious but I felt like it needed some trimming. You literally get shrimp in a soft taco shell. No pico no veggies nothing. I wasn't even offered that as an option.   Service was ok. Nothing special. I didn't feel the southern hospitality I thought I would receive maybe my expectations were too high.   I would def recommend this place. Especially in the area. Check",

When we first walked in, we were warmly greeted by the entire staff with a \"Welcome to Cuzzo's!\"  This followed by every other guest that came in, which definitely set the tone for us.  The girl that took our order was very friendly and overall the service was incredible.    The restaurant is very cramped, with the maximum seating capacity per booth at a very intimate 4.  Maybe this isn't the case when there are less people, but it was slammed when we got there.  Certainly a tight squeeze.    You should also know before ordering that you're going to wait.  There's a sign on the wall that says all food is made fresh and your wait is estimated between 5-20 minutes, and we were told it would be more like 30 for us as the restaurant was very busy.   We ended up waiting 30 minutes exactly.    We ordered:  Red Velvet waffles and chicken wings Fish tacos Shrimp and grits Seasoned fries Lobster Mac and cheese  As far as the food goes....wow.   Everything was absolutely outstanding.  The red velvet waffle was amazingly moist and delicious, the wings were fried perfectly.   The shrimp and grits had an amazing flavor and perfect texture, not runny in the slightest.  The lobster Mac and cheese was actually penne pasta with generous chunks of lobster throughout and delicious.  The fish tacos are what really blew me away -- it's an entire fried fish filet per taco!  Amazingly seasoned and by far the biggest knockout of the meal.    Cuzzo's is definitely a small, friendly, down-home eatery that is not somewhere to stop in for a quick meal, but certainly a must-go for delicious soul food served with a friendly smile.",

I just happened to be out near that side of town when I saw the owner standing outside speaking with a small camera crew. Cuzzo's was offering free meals to the federal workers effected by the govt shut down - and he was getting the word out.   Do not be surprised by the size, look, or location- Cuzzo's is a must visit for the Charlotte food enthusiast. I was heavily greeted with hello's and welcomes when I entered the restaurant. The staff was smiling and friendly and I ( with my huge personality ) told them I had arrived! They entertained my antics and the owner even pointed out a few suggestions for me off the menu.   Of course I tried the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Baby!!!! it was heavenly.. giant chucks of lobster meat, penne pasta covered in a smooth slightly spicy cheese. It was perfect. I ordered the side option to go - which came jam packed in a plastic container. I also order a PEACH COBBLER BELGIAN WAFFLE... and yes I had to yell it at you because it was that great. I could not believe they could master the taste of homemade down home peach cobbler and turn it into a fluffy yet crispy waffle. I am in love with this place and I cannot wait to go back.",

I must say the wings were really big in size, but I'm not sure the jerk flavor was there. I really liked the mac n cheese. It was pretty flavorful. This place has a pretty good following from the line of people that were there. I think I'll try it again but maybe a different wing flavor. The staff were really nice and the location was nice. It has a lot of community pictures and appears to show a lot of love for the area. I really like that so I'll definitely be back.",

Customer service is always good. Food sometimes can be inconsistent on quality but when it's good it's really good!

I came on a Sunday with my husband and we got the buffet for $16. We waited about 20-25 minutes, which i didn't mind at all. We both ordered the same meal. Collard greens, which were meatless, rice, Mac n cheese, lobster Mac n cheese, mixed vegetables that consist of squash, broccoli,and carrots, yams and a red velvet waffle with strawberries and a cream cheese drizzle. There was meat included but we are non meat eaters.   Every single dish was flavorful and seasoned to perfections. I would give them 10 stars. Best soulful spot in town. Hands down.",

Wife had the shrimp and grits.    Wings were perfectly cooked. Lobster Mac and cheese definitely the best I have had.  Chunks of lobster so big I thought it was shrimp.  Shrimps and grits were off the chain as well.  Best I have ever eaten in this region as well.    Small dining area but big enough to find a table. Very friendly employees and clean spot.   The place is pricey but worth it.  I have no problem paying as long as the food is awesome and it was.   I will definitely return and highly recommend to anyone else.   The food is cooked to order so there is about a 10-15 min wait depending on what is ordered.   Well done chef and owner.",

The Lobster Mac & Cheese....AMAZING!!!!! I wanted so much more than I ate!  The shrimp and wings with the Carolina BBQ sauce was delicious! I would've gave them more stars...but my veggies were really overcooked and the chicken tenders didn't have any flavor.  They have this cucumber lemonade drink that was super refreshing!

And the drinks are bottles for $2.50. No free refills. The food is served on to go containers with incredibly chincy \"plasticware\" with a tiny TINY napkin.  Just.... no.  Oh my WORD I can't get past this pine cleaner smell as I'm writing this!    No servers; it's self  service.  Be aware before you go in expecting to relax.

I was easily able to make two meals out of it for myself, and it was very reasonably priced for the portion.   The lobster mac is necessary. I've never had any complaints about the lobster/mac ratio personally. For me, it's about the spices that they use in the mac, they're out of this world.   On my second visit I got cajun dry-rub wings and those were fantastic as well. A coworker of mine got them on a previous occasion and said, \"I would fight someone who tried to take these wings from me.\"   Also, they were running a special on the day I went for the second time. Fried lobster mac balls and fries. My friend who I was eating with ordered these and they were awesome. Hope to see them as a menu item in the future.",

The icing that they put on those waffles are so good you don't even eat syrup and the red velvet waffles are so delicious unlike any other waffle.  My husband and I finally found their restaurant location after looking for their truck on numerous late nights when we were on a red velvet waffle crave and they never seem to disappoint.  The people in the restaurant were very courteous and remains professional and greeted us the environment was cool and I like the fact that everyone was nice and had a great vibe.  We also try their famous lobster mac and cheese and that was delicious so we will definitely be back again and I'm so glad that we found the actual restaurant so we don't have to chase the food truck!",

We ordered the lobster mac and cheese, wings and fries, the red velvet waffle with wings and two lemonades (the regular and the one infused with pineapple and some other fruits). Let me kick this review off with the lobster mac and cheese - definitely a winner and the world's best! The wings (with the homemade seasoning) were cooked perfectly and seasoned well! The crinkle fries were also seasoned and tasty. That red velvet waffle was everything! Now the lemonade: I wasn't a fan of the yellow/regular lemonade but the raspberry colored one (the one infused with pineapples and other fruits) was good! I'd definitely order that one upon my return because I will be back. Now the reason this gets four stars is because either ranch/blue cheese comes with the wings (whatever you choose) but we wanted hot sauce for the wings and they charge you $0.50. Typically when you sell wings, people like hot sauce. We originally planned to dine in, but after that we said we would go home because we had hot sauce had home. Who charges for hot sauce??? Luckily one of the employees ended up giving it to us for free since it was our first time but we just thought that was ridiculous! Despite that hiccup, our visit was great and we'll be back!",

The chicken was just friend chicken, the greens were good, man and cheese was good but I've had much better. Candied yams could use some depth of flavor instead of just white sugar, more cinnamon etc. spaghetti was kind of off the wall with the other items.",

I went to the Sunday brunch buffet. I typically don't do buffets but I liked the fact that the staff serves the food and is generous. The Yams  brought a tear to my eye. They tasted like an angel flew down from heaven and kissed the cook. I'll certainly be back.",

It probably doesn't matter to most people but I love that they using whiting for their fish instead of the tilapia or catfish you see at most places.   Everything is perfectly seasoned and taste fresh. I can't recommend this spot enough.",

The portion was very small for the price. I also order a lemonade cucumber juice $3.00. Which I never got. I called in my order so I guess I forgot and so did the lady. Maybe I'll get it next time.  As far as my fish plate it was nothing to write home about. Pretty much basic. I'm sure my husband will visit again.",
