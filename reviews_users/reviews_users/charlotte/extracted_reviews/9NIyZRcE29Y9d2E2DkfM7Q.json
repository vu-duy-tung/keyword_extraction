Waited over an hour for  table on a slow Sunday night only to end up at bar anyway! Bartenders were friendly and helpful pairing drinks and courses! Spirit list and wine list to die for!! We sampled mussels with chorizo and grilled bread, the filet and grouper special. Each dish was phenomenal and deserved it's own 5 star rating. Cant wait to return and have already made reservations!",

Fine, but nothing special. We had unsalted fries that were clearly from (the bottom of) a freezer bag; not cut or made onsite which is disappointing for a \"private club\" of this stature. Our second seafood appetizer also lacked salt.The place looked great, but I think execution is seriously lacking for the hype and the reputation. Bathrooms hadn't been serviced and there were no hand towels to be found. They should have waited a few more months to open and got it right. Service was friendly though and it's far less pretentious than Dot Dot Dot. We'll give it another shot in 6 months. Please salt your food, chefs.",

The open fire stove and exposed brick gave it a nice, cozy feeling similar to the location in Chapel Hill. Although this place was packed, we were served promptly, and the bartenders, staff, and owners ensured that we were looked after all night. The drinks were great as always and we ended up getting charred oysters, which were amazing. I'm excited to go back when the hype dies down some and have a full sit down meal here. The food smelled and looked awesome.  Overall, I would highly recommend you check this place out!",

We arrived at 5:30 pm and the place was pretty busy. From the beginning the confusion was evident. We were seated and then re-seated at a different table. We could not tell who our server was because 3 different ones stopped by yet it took 20 minutes to get a beer. The menu is incredibly limited, so iwhat you serve better be delicious. All 4 of us ordered the burger and on first bite all commented that it was way too salty. The fries were good. Twice the wrong drinks were brought to our table and once the food was brought a server did not come to our table. We had to get up and find a server to get our check. There did not appear to be a manager on the floor to manage the chaos. Overall, not worth the time or money.",

Love the original Chapel Hill location which has just enough of the tweed elbowed patched professorial vibe to soften the preppy collegiate scene. The Charlotte version is like if brooks brothers and BofA opened a bar - Except not as cozy. Lots of alligatored, plaided and pulitzered professionals hanging here. Biggest complaint is that the bar is too brightly lit. I was hoping for a dark, warm, old school vibe me where you could order a top shelf high ball minus the star anise and mole bitters. Craft cocktails are so passe. The decor is spot on if they would just take down or turn off the giant chandeliers. The place has so much potential - it just needs to do some soul searching.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place and will be back to try it out again in a few months.  It's a beautiful space and the seats at the bar are very comfortable.  I ordered the Dusty Cactus and it was SUPER sweet.  I didn't understand it since it didn't mention anything sweet in the ingredients.  My husband ordered the Post Prohibition Old Fashioned and thought it was good but had one better later that night at Customshop.  From what I have read, the cocktails are supposed to be the star of this place but we didn't order a second because we weren't that crazy about the first.  I asked if any of the Chardonnay's were French or unoaked and the bartender said they hadn't done much training on the wine.  He did offer to let me try them but I didn't want to try all 3 since they were pretty busy.  If there was some information on where they came from, I am sure I could have narrowed it down to one I would have liked.    For food, we ordered the chopped salad, the charred Oysters and the Burger.  The chopped salad was so salty we only took a few bites. I like a good amount of salt but this had to have been a mistake in the kitchen.  The charred Oysters were good but didn't have that much flavor.  The burger had a nice char on the outside and was super juicy.  The fries were not hot, but were still good.     We had tried to go on the Saturday after they opened at 1pm since their website said they were opened at 12pm on Saturdays and Sundays.  They had a sign outside that said \"Google is incorrect, we open at 4pm.  We hope to see you then.\"  Google was not incorrect, their website was incorrect.    I hope once they are open awhile the food and cocktails get better.  The service was very good and the space is really comfortable.",

I expected an upscale lounge with fine and exclusive choices of spirits and house cocktails. I was truly disappointed! The establishment was brightly lit with obnoxious TVs with the sound of football blaring! Was I at a sports bar? I may as well have! No dim mood lights, no candles on the tables, no chill/lounge music, and no amazing staff! After having dinner elsewhere, my group and I wanted some late night cocktails and conversation, but the space is set up more as an open restaurant as opposed to a lounge/chill cocktail bar. Upon closing out our bill, the server even said, \"Maybe next time you'll come with an appetite!\" Excuse me?!?! The Crunkleton has a lot to live up to compared to other places that are far better such as Dot Dot Dot, Backstage Lounge, or The Punch Room.",

If your group is full of meat-eaters, try the Tomahawk for the table - it's a 48 oz steak cooked to perfection directly over their Argentinian wood burning oven, complete with roasted hearth vegetables, the best garlic bread ever, and drizzled lightly with an herb-infused butter. Service is phenomenal - Ask your server what their favorite drink or item is and their recommendations will not disappoint. I recommend the prohibition era old fashioned or the Mezcal Mule! Try the berry crumble pie or the s'mores for dessert. You will not be disappointed!",

It's worth noting that tables turn quick as most folks seem to come in for a drink to instagram and maybe their burger. We said for a few hours and explored both the food and drink menu. Charred oysters and the tomahawk steak for the favorites for food. Cocktails were well done, the penicillin being the favorite new school but the old fashioned and sazerac were both well done.  I know the owners intentions were to make this place welcoming For everyone but \"a hippo is a hippo\" and this place reminds me a lot of the negative reviews Dot Dot Dot got when they opened.

First of all, you have to sign up for a membership for $10, (which their website describes is NC law for private clubs, which is True, but usually only places that don't serve food have this restriction), which is fine, whatever.    When we get there, the bar is full except for 2 seats at a smaller bar by the hearth grill.  I actually prefer to sit at the bar so this is fine with me, but then it becomes very unclear who we would be ordering drinks or food from.  A couple 4 top tables open up and the hostess says my wife and I can have one of them, so we do.  After ordering a first round of cocktails and the wings, I let the server know we have food cooking at home and came to check out the cocktails (mostly because it's new and is billed as more of a cocktail bar, and also has a private club membership, which doesn't exactly scream PLEASE EAT HERE).  From that point some more people came in and by the time we had ordered another drink it was clear that they wanted us to leave since the manager looked at us every 5 seconds and loudly said as he walked by our table \"people are waiting\".  I fully understand that they don't want people waiting, but if thats the case, don't sit us there in the first place.  It's not like we ordered waters either.  Our tab was still $80+ in under an hour.  The waitress also became a little passive aggressive about it, I'm assuming because he gave her a hard time.    Other than that, the cocktails were definitely good and reasonably priced, but far from the best in Charlotte.  The wings were actually very good.  Just a weird vibe and kind of annoying to feel rushed out of a place when I would prefer not to even be sitting at a table in the first place.",

Only downfall I've experienced is the occasional line at the hostess table. Often this is due to folks applying for membership at the door. Perhaps require the membership to be purchased ahead of arrival? Otherwise, a perfect place for drinks, snacks or a meal.",

We had the Brussel sprouts (some of the best in Charlotte), oysters, and fries.  Nothing disappointed!  We each had a craft cocktail (highly recommend the Elderflower Sour) and a glass of wine(Hayes cab sauv) and loved it all!  The service was fantastic, we really felt like we were part of the family!

    "text": "Definitely a cool vibe in Elizabeth! The cocktails are amazing and styled beautifully.  I enjoyed the Elderflower Sour it was refreshing, interesting kick due to the ginger and took the edge off a perfect choice for me..I had to try their acclaimed burger and fries which was delish...the burger blend was rich and flavor.  The. Mussels and unlimited grilled bread was good, would have been fantastic without the tomatoes which made it too acidic.  I don't eat oysters but my friends loved the grilled oysters.  Everyone else ordered the nightly specials and seemed to enjoy them especially the lamb and squash blossoms.  The pecan pie and ice cream dessert was yummy, not as sweet as grandmas but rich deep pecan crumbly goodness with a salty caramel like flavor. The friendly staff all worked as a team and really knew the menu and could answer our endless questions.  Tips: make a reservation a couple weeks in advance and the restaurant can only accommodate a group size up to 8. Your tab for the night could vary from $30-$300 depending on your drinking taste and food pairings.",

    "text": "I went on a Saturday around 5pm. Saw the wings here on a list for best wings and of course had to try them. My first impression was not good. I wanted to place an order to go but wasn't sure if I could since they are joining the many restaurants that now want to do the stupid private club thing. Anyway, I was immediately annoyed when I couldn't find a phone number to contact them. Luckily, I was nearby and decided to swing by. I was able to find parking quickly but can see it being tight/nonexistent on a busy night. Walking in was another little annoyance. There was a very short line but it took awhile to get to the hostess because there were a few people who weren't members and had to fill out the application. But there isn't a lot of space in the \"entryway\" so it felt crowded even though there were only 3 or 4 people in front of me. On the plus side, the space is beautiful and I loved the vibe. Also, the staff were nice enough.   Finally get to the hostess and am able to order food to go. Random, but I like their to go packaging. As far as the wings go, I can't say I'd want them again. The flavor of the wings was good but I felt like they could have been cooked longer. Also, I consider any order of wings that's more than $1 per wing to be expensive so I thought these were expensive since it was $12 for 8 wings.   Would I return? I really don't know. If I wouldn't go back for the wings, I can't think of any other reason why I'd return.",

So it shouldn't be surprising that I was slightly miffed when I walked in the other night after the Avett Brothers concert and was greeted by the host asking me for either 1) my membership card, or 2) $10 for my membership card. I am really not a fan of having to pay to get into a place where I'm ultimately going to spending a lot of money on drinks and giving you my business. When I questioned the $10 and suggested to my group that we look at other options, the host informed me that they \"are proud\" and that I could \"definitely go somewhere else\" while making a hand gesture shooing me out the door. How kind. BUT I DIGRESS.  My sweet husband bought the membership card and we walked over to the bar with our group of 5. The Crunkleton is really beautiful inside. I love the look, and it definitely feels upscale. Our bartender was very kind and attentive. I ordered the Elder Flower Sour and it was very refreshing, strong, and delicious. It had a long, thin, piece of cucumber wrapped inside the glass that made the drink almost too pretty to drink. I wasn't letting that cucumber go to waste; it tasted delicious! Overall, I think the Crunkleton is a cool spot. Maybe my husband will take me back on his membership.",

The antique bourbons are impressive, and so interesting--you literally cannot buy them anywhere else, which I just think is the coolest. I'm not a bourbon drinker myself, but their wine list covers essentials with a few uncommon choices. They have this sparkling rose I could put a straw in.  The mussels are out of control, and are hands down  my favorite so far. I can't wait to try the dry-aged tomahawk! Anyway, I can't speak to the same sentiment as those Chapel Hill fans (Go Wolfpack!), but this location does a great job of standing on its own!   It's more than worth the $10 annual membership. Just do yourself a favor and make reservations, or get there early enough to grab a seat at the spectacular bar!",

    "text": "Breaks my heart to write this compared to the excitement I had of its arrival. Wrote a note to the partners via the website after having been there opening night and the day after - was encouraged to share my feedback by a bar tender. Waiting to hear back, if at all, from the partners.  Per the previous reviews, there was A LOT of neighborhood hype for this establishment. Having been to the Chapel Hill location, I had certain expectations.   The whole membership thing is a cash grab. I was willing to pay, but the process was unorganized and not all the staff were briefed, which took away from a premium experience membership should provide. Food is provided; membership not required by law. If it is, most of Charlotte's food and beverage scene is illegal. **Membership in one, does not allow membership in the other**  I really love the lounge space at the Chapel Hill location and disappointed this location didn't have something similar. I was also disappointed by the large TV's flanking the bar, detracting from a higher end experience.   Real kicker - asked a bar tender how the day was going and told, \"Shitty.\" In the end, we chatted after an apology and learned that the staff felt rushed to open the place and they weren't ready. The bar tender's description matched my experience. Drink recipes visible, bar tenders clearly lost, and lack of knowledge on the wine when asked.   Didn't try the food - can't comment there. They used a lot of space for tables and kitchen for the limited menu they have. From a business side, I wonder if they couldn't have done without and stuck with membership as a bar, and actually had the lounge space I hoped to be there.  The exposed brick is great, the original ceiling beams awesome, and the flooring amazing. The bar stools are top notch and the large booths really inviting.    It has been packed for days, people will continue to go and I doubt my review will change that. I'll go back hoping things improve, but at this very moment in time, The Stanley (2 doors down) has a better drink menu, better service, and a welcoming staff.",

The portions were tiny. And the menu lacked enough selection, unless everything on the limited menu is ON POINT, which is wasn't. We had two cocktails, two glasses of wine, and three apps ($135 w tip) before deciding to go elsewhere for a main course to finish our evening. The charred oysters were the highlight, the rest...meh. They were out of steak (at 7:30 on a Wed) which is what we were craving. We may be back, but will let some time pass before we try again. Hopefully our $10 a piece memberships are lifetime. The service was GREAT. Our waitress Jamie was attentive and quick to deliver.",

We sat at the 2-seater chef counter area and had a lot of fun watching all the guys do their thing. When we were there, 2 huge boxes of fresh oysters from the Virginia coast had arrived. One guy in particular, Billy, was awesome and told us a good bit about the restaurant's fresh food sourcing. Very impressive how much is straight from the ocean or fields in the morning, only to be served at The Crunkleton later that night! I ordered the most underrated item on the menu, but don't miss it -- the half marinated chicken with skillet vegetables. OMG that flavor! Melt in your mouth. Hubs ordered one of the amazing burgers with house made fries. The S'mores dessert in skillet is a must-get!!!",

    "text": "My first review of 2019! My friends and I came here on a rainy cold Saturday night. There are quite a bit of new restaurants and lounges opening up in the QC and we're checking off our list. When I arrived, it was super packed at about 9:30/9:45pm. There was barely any room to get into the space to the host stand. I checked in with my membership. I still don't understand the concept of having a membership when they serve food. The membership is $10 if you haven't heard and you can purchase it online. The downside is that the membership only lasts a year and you can only have one other guest. The wait time for a table was an hour for our party of four. I was definitely not going to wait an hour for a table but some people left the bar area and 4 seats opened up that we quickly grabbed. The bar and bar area are first come first serve. The hostess told us that there wasn't any bar service at the high top tables in the bar area but a nice gentleman came and served us. The food menu isn't extensive and it had some interesting dishes such as peas and rice, chicken wings, oysters, mussels, wedge salad, soup. The kitchen closes at 10:30pm I believe, so if you're looking for late night food, this isn't your place. I ordered the burnt garlic and herb fries and a mocktail. I wasn't drinking that night thanks to a dry January challenge so I asked the server if the bartenders could concoct me something and he said absolutely. I told him to surprise me. The food came within a decent amount of time. The fries are okay, they put a lot of shaved parmesan cheese on them. The garlic flavors is not overpowering but you can definitely taste it. I'm not sure what the burnt herbs were on the fries, but I couldn't taste them over the garlic. My mocktail was quite delicious. I'm not sure exactly what was in it but it was orange and it was tart and tangy. I loved it so much, I ordered two.  The owner was also there and he came and talked with us. He was really nice. My overall impression of the place is that it's okay. It's not a big place. There are two large tvs that were showing the game. I'm not quite sure how it's different from any other lounge in the QC that serves hand crafted cocktails and that don't have a $10 membership. If I come back, I'm going to try to do so before my annual membership expires. My overall experience was a good one, and the service was good. I just can't justify continuing to purchase an annual $10 membership when this place was reminiscent of several other free lounges in the city.",

    "text": "Look, Charlotte definitely has a need for more options that embrace the craft cocktail culture that thrives in other cities. This place had an opportunity to fit that bill if it wasn't an epic fail all around.  My girlfriend and I were looking for a nightcap after a Friday night dinner so we stopped by. The hostess wasn't welcoming, assumed we should already know about or have a \"membership\", and walked away after we paid for one. As soon as we made it clear we were only getting drinks she was done with us. We found our own spot at the bar and sat ourselves. No one at the bar greeted us for over 10 minutes. I get it, fancy drinks take time to make, which is fine, but sitting there parched, envious of waters around us, and without a hello, not cool. When we finally got our drinks, which weren't anything special, the interaction was very transactional and impersonal. Who likes being so serious? I'm in the mood to have a good time so I tried asking a simple question and the response equated to - I'd rather be dead than here in this moment.   It would have been so simple to impress us. Have good customer service to support the 10-dollar fee and produce amazing drinks. You could even be... excited you're doing it! I do not recommend this place at all. Full stop. I wish I could get the 10 dollars back.",

He helped us out with our drink choice...started with the Desert Cactus followed by the Elderflower Sour (with vodka instead of gin). Loved the vibe....sat at the hightops by the front window. Also had a few appies which were delicious. Nice addition to the Queen City",

It was long-hyped in the Charlotte Agenda, had a following from Chapel Hill, and featured my favorite classic cocktail: the Vieux Carre.   I was underwhelmed.   We visitors late on a Saturday night. The place was busy but not packed and we were promptly seated. We reviewed the menu. Two of the party inquired about specific cocktails and asked \"are they sweet?\" We were told no. The drinks came out sugary sweet.   My Vieux Carre has a ton of ice and the volume was huge. The ice looked like ice from an ice maker on your standard refrigerator. One of the things I was expecting based on writings about the restaurant is their attention to details, such as ice.   I didn't finish my cocktail.   Our waitress also left us sitting with empty water glasses and a beer that needed a refill (which we ordered) for over 30 minutes.   My drink was better at the Stanley next door. Go there.",

    "text": "Six years ago, if you were serious about getting a proper cocktail in North Carolina, you made the trek to go see Gary Crunkleton at The Crunkleton in Chapel Hill. So when there first started to be rumblings about a Crunkleton opening in Charlotte, I was very excited. Years later I am left wondering how the magic got lost coming down the I-85.  To be fair, they are still in soft opening mode, but our experience there was well below expectations. The staff were nice enough and they were understaffed , but two separate parts of our order (one food, one drink) got lost somewhere between executiion and our table. When food arrived, silverware did not, and I had to flag down the manager to get some.   Although the cocktail menu suggests ordering bespoke drinks, they were really only prepared to offerwhat was on the menu of classic cockatils. What is on the menu is fine (e.g. Vieux Farre, Last Word, Aviation, Jungle Bird), but it faltered by being neither really modern nor executed at a high enough level to warrant the tightly edited menu.  I will say that they get points for the food coming out of the open fire hearth kitchen, which has a nice woodsy smoky flavor.   On the whole though there are much better cocktails in Charlotte and better food. Hopefully The Crunkleton will find its footing in the coming months, but for now I would pass on it.",

The cocktail menu (for a cocktail bar) left a bit to be desired, but overall a really good meal. Atmosphere wise - it was pretty loud in there and sitting by the kitchen was neat, but definitely not the most intimate dining experience. Also, we were obviously two couples, but our waitress didn't even ask about splitting the check, but just brought one to the table. If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but just didn't seem like a 4 star overall experience due to price v. Atmosphere",

Wanted a good steak, but their best steaks require you bring others to share it with. No single servings.  Drink was good, but it should be for what I paid for it.  Nice look and feel, but very loud inside.  Nothing there to help absorb sound at all.  Chairs also very low.  Kinda felt like a kid at the table.  Lamb was good, but also very expensive for only four small chops.  Staff was very nice.  Maybe a better place to just drink vs. eat.",

Ordered a spring grain salad which according to the menu was arugula, farro, beets, chevre, spring veg, pesto, shrooms, blood orange vinaigrette.  The salad arrived without arugula, beets, shrooms, barely any chevre, not sure about the pesto and had strawberries on it.  For $16, I would expect the salad to show up as advertised.  The drinks were pretty good, so I would recommend just going for drinks and eating elsewhere.",

    "text": "This place was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS!!!  I've heard about it, but haven't m tried them for myself, and I'm so glad I did. Walking in I was blown away by the massive spirit wall, which also had a sliding ladder. The host greeted us and shared their availability for the evening. When we arrived, they were full with reservations, but the host suggested the Chef's table to us. I was sold when she said Chef if I can always sit at the chef's table of a restaurant I certainly would. So with big glowing smiles in our faces.   Membership Oh we also paid $10 for the membership with is required due to the number of spirits they carry within the restaurant. It outweighs their food menu, so with No laws, they are required to have a membership. I was okay with it because it was only $10 and not $50.   Chefs Table Our Chefs for the night were so great! We introduced ourselves and every question we had, and they provided an answer. And of course, allowed us to do a little sampling which excited my heart and belly. We even had too secret dessert which I will not reveal but note it will blow your socks off! So good!  Seating The restaurant is small and not built for large parties at all. But great for a group of 6-8 at most and especially great for date night.   Parking I must say as many of you know CLT is a construction nightmare and parking is taking a massive hit during that process. So this also goes for the parking at Crunkleton. The parking lot here is tiny and planning for dinner at 6:00 pm I would not advise. Suggest Uber for sure, or you'll circle the parking lot.",

    "text": "I've been looking for a place like this in Charlotte for years.  My girlfriend and I decided on the Crunkleton for date night Saturday night.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by Joe who we dubbed, \"Joe-Easy.\" (Don't tell Halsey.)  He made us one of the best old fashioned I've ever had.  Extremely well balanced and smooth.  Then we had a round of Mint Juleps.  Joe put a great deal of care and work into making the cocktails.  They were immaculate.  Lastly, for a finisher I couldn't remember the cocktail I wanted and described it to Joe.  Bam, he knew exactly how to make a NY Sour and killed it.  The staff as a whole was so pleasant and if Joe stepped away to make another cocktail someone was always checking in to make sure we had what needed.  We started with the Mussels... They were perfectly done and the Chorizo was such a nice touch I'm going to begin including that in my recipe at home.  I had seen previous reviews that the broth will knock your socks off and we definable had to indulge in a little more bread to sop up the sauce.  They knocked them out of the park.  Next up, my girlfriend had the chicken and I went with the calabash dish. The chicken was perfectly cooked and a super generous portion.  My calabash was the perfect hangover buster and so fresh and not greasy or over fried in any way. Both portion were very generous.  Let's talk pricing... we've been to places like 5 church and other similar concepts and they charge so much more.  I think that the price points at Crunkleton are so fair and appreciated.  Easily we'd have paid $200 at similar places in Charlotte, but were able to get out of there under $150.  The atmosphere was amazing; however the only small critique I would have is to figure something out about the use of the space.  Although once seated at the bar we were fairly comfortable, the bar area in general is very congested and cramped.  Perhaps rethinking the oversized seating, although comfortable, not very conducive to socializing.  Go here, you'll love it!!!",

We got to sit at what they call \"the chefs table.\" You basically sit at a bar and can see the kitchen while they prep these meals up. Not my favorite spot since it was really hot, but the food is amazing! I didn't mind sitting there because they do a really good job with bringing your food on time, hot, and nicely presented! Next time I'll go I'll make sure to nail a table under the AC for sure!   The atmosphere is great and the staff is really nice! We got there and hanged out at the bar for like 10 min and enjoyed a classic old fashioned and it was really good quality! It wasn't pricey either; drinks are pretty affordable!   We ordered multiple appetizers and they are pretty big and filling. By the time we had to order our main dish we had to share because we were getting pretty stuffed and wanted to save room for dessert.   I love the restaurant decoration and how they have arranged their tables! The acoustic is great since it's loud, but you can have a conversation and still are able to listen!   Please save room for dessert and have the s'mores pie since it was fabulous! One of the best desserts I've had in a while. Hopefully I'll be back soon for more!",

My husband and I went for date night, and we were so happy with our experience. It was a random Wednesday, early, which probably had something to do with the attention and love we received.   I began with the penicillin cocktail. I had had this cocktail at their Chapel Hill location and loved it. It was just as good and still remained our favorite cocktail of the evening. My husband had the dusty cactus and he wasn't too happy with it. We also had a Sazerac and a painkiller and they were both delicious.  We started with the brussel sprouts. A few were undercooked, but otherwise the flavor was good and we loved the sauce. We then had the gumbo with two fried oysters on top. It was fantastic. After eating that, I was convinced I needed a full plate of their fried oysters.   We shared the burger, which was just as fantastic as everyone has said. I appreciated that it was affordable and came with fries. The burger was cooked perfectly. Very juicy.  We ended the evening with the new s'mores dessert. I am a s'mores fanatic, so I'm very picky regarding these deserts. This was one of my favorite s'mores desserts I've ever had. The bourbon marshmallows made in-house over chocolate were delicious. I appreciated the pairing with gingerbread cookies. This was new and different and I appreciated this.  The bartenders were very attentive and kind. They made fantastic drinks and were passionate about working there.   I expected this place to be too fancy to afford, but they had plenty of affordable food dishes. The cocktails are pricey, but no different than anywhere else in Charlotte. You can split a burger and have a side and a cocktail or two and still won't be too expensive.  We Loved our experience and will be back.",

There is a $10 membership charge, which is similar to other places in town. I will say that I was not a fan of the amount of personal information required on the membership form. Giving you my driver's license number feels like an invasion of privacy.   We came for the cocktails. I was impressed with them overall. I tried a sip of what everyone got and all of them were very good. I got the Elderflower Sour which was by far my favorite drink of the night. It was light and refreshing -- probably one of my favorite cocktails. I had a sip of The French that someone else had and that was my second favorite drink of the night. We finished with the Penicillin which was very good. Whiskey isn't my liquor of choice, but it was a good drink.   I needed some food while we were there so we got the burger and the wings. Both were incredibly good. The burger wasn't anything fancy, but it was delicious. We upgraded to the burnt garlic and herb fries which were great. The wings had and amazing spicy/sweet sauce and were served with a great blue cheese. The food menu is pretty small, but it's good.   It's not a cheap place as far as cocktails go. They're at the same price point as the other fancy Charlotte cocktails ($10-$15), but don't come expecting a cheap cocktail. They have beer and wine too which were reasonably priced. The food was also reasonably priced.   The decor is absolutely gorgeous. It's very cozy inside. The shelving and ladders behind the bar remind me of a library. There is a completely open kitchen in the back. And a final random note - they have warm washclothes instead of paper towels/hand dryers in the bathroom.   If you're into cocktails, this place is one of the best in Charlotte. I would definitely recommend checking it out!",

    "text": "This place definitely lived up to the hype.  On my radar for a while, I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this Chapel Hill staple, and they did not disappoint.    As an upscale cocktail club in accordance with True NC law, you must have a \"membership\" to enter.  Memberships may be purchased at the door, but are best purchased in advance online.  The cost is $10 annually and your membership grants you and one guest entry.  Once in, as you'd expect, the focus in on the handcrafted cocktails, but the food is amazing as well.  I had the burger and was wowed beyond my wildest imagination.  Easily one of the best burgers I've had in my entire life.  The only miss that the printing on the menu read \"cheese, pickles, lettuce, sauce.\"  In reality, it also had shoestring sweet red onions.  Personally, I do not like onions, so I would've asked they be left off had I known to expect them.  Despite this, the burger was still amazing.  Perfectly cooked with the best char flavor.  Even the bun was flame toasted.  The cocktail menu will change seasonally, but the winter menu offered an amazing ElderFlower Sour served with thinly sliced cucumbers lining the glass.  My group tried a variety of drinks and I was able to sample a few as we shared our glasses around the table.  Every taste was exquisite.  As with most businesses in this tiny Elizabeth shopping center, parking can be a True challenge.  However, this place is very much the type to Uber to, so you may unbridledly enjoy the cocktails.  Keep in mind, they do not take reservations, as it is a members only club, so plan accordingly.  If there's a wait, it's worth it!",

    "text": "I had been waiting for this place to open for quite some time, and I'm so glad I got to try it on Valentine's Day! I think that Charlotte sadly has a dearth of great cocktail bars, so I'm really pleased to have another option.   I'm not sure at all why other reviewers think the sign-up process for a membership is unduly taxing. It's pretty standard information, and it's a breeze to do it online on their website. Maybe I'm just a weirdo because I have Alexas all over my house and have done 23AndMe, but I didn't think any of the details they asked for were too invasive.   Anyway, it's a cute, smallish space. It definitely feels more like a restaurant than a bar, though, which distinguishes it from places like Dot Dot Dot that feel more bar-y.   The cocktails here are great. I really enjoyed the three (oops...maybe one too many) that I had. But I was not expecting the food to be so amazing. The charred oysters with Parmesan cheese were delightful. I also tried a sugar toad for the first time in my life. It's not a toad, mind you, but apparently a small pufferfish. Don't look it up on Google. It's kind of adorable, and you'll feel bad you ate one. Anyway, it was a delicate fried fish. We also had a duck tamale that was quite good. But the shining star here was the gumbo with fried oysters and duck that was on special when we went. AMAZING. And thoughtfully served with Louisiana Hot Sauce (even though I'm #TeamCrystal).   Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Maybe we just got there early, but I didn't feel rushed at all. We were there a solid hour and a half.   A couple tiny things I'd love to see: some vodka-based cocktails would be great, and dessert would be wonderful. It's nice to have that conclusion to a meal. I heard another table voice this idea, as well, so I don't think it's just me.   But regardless, we had an amazing date here and will definitely return!",

Eventually, I asked \"what's The Crunkleton?\" and I got the response \"Only the best bar ever in Chapel Hill!\"  Ok, got it.  It's a bar, and since we really do need some more bar options in the Elizabeth/Plaza area, I welcome you with open arms!  When this place finally opened, we of course had to go.  To our surprise, this place had food, so we all went for an early dinner.  I started out with their version of an Old Fashioned.  They have an entire wall behind the bar with a beautiful selection of liquors, so I just had to order a cocktail!  Then we moved on to the wings. Delish. Our main courses were the the ones to write home about. Our friends had the burger and chicken. Three words for you...Get the Chicken.  It was incredibly moist and tasty. The gold star of the night was the tomahawk. It's $110 well spent. They slice the meat off the bone so you don't have to do it, and it comes with veggies and potatoes with bread to sop up the juice. I know they say \"for the table\", but my husband and I crushed the whole thing by ourselves and left nothing but the bone on the block. I would literally go back to The Crunkleton just for this meal.  Overall a great experience and super fun to go with friends for dinner and a good, solid drink. Once this place settles down, I'm excited to have a new cool spot in the neighborhood to visit!",

Great bar area along with u-shaped booths on the opposite of the room with tables in between...our Party of four was seated on a booth.  We started with several specialty cocktails and some apps before dinner.  Don't laugh..my wife' ordered the wings..and they had a nice sweet and tangy sauce..two thumbs up ...the second app were the grilled oysters..delicious!!  we couldn't decide what we wanted and I spotted a 42 oz tomahawk ribeye on the menu... something I've always wanted to order and convinced the rest of the table to join in a carnivore's dream.  We all dove in... the meat temp was not an issue as the chef cooked it medium rare and sliced it off the bone... my wife wanted hers well done so the waiter took several pcs back to the grill. By the way the grill was an oak pit that was constantly stoked which provided a great flavor finish  Overall a very good experience as the apps and steak were perfect.  The only negative is a little place is a little pricey.  We will visit again",

If you have ever gone to the original Crunkleton in Chapel Hill, this one takes it up a notch (and by notch, I mean it has food). We came in late on random Wednesday so we really didn't get to try any of the food yet, but I'll definitely update my review once I do. Anyone want to split a 36 oz tomahawk ribeye made in their open fire grill?  I'm a whisky drinker (bourbon, scotch, etc). So when I go to a new place I usually give the bartender dealers choice on what to get. Alyssa gave me her signature pre-prohibition old fashioned on rye (less sweet, more booze forward). It wasn't a trendy old fashioned, it was a good ol' classic throwback that may have been the best I've had in Charlotte. It could have been the drink or if could have been the fact that they have super duper machine that makes ice blocks.   The service was good, most of the bartenders I talked to were very knowledgeable and friendly. I'm looking forward to many nights hanging out at this fine establishment.",

There was a long line waiting for tables and this was further slowed down by the fact that most people were having to purchase a membership (which is $10 and lasts for a year) before they could be seated.   The space is beautiful - loved the decor, exposed brick, tile in the open kitchen, cool barstools, great lighting. They did an awesome job!   We got a table and a server immediately came to us. Our group of 3 immediately ordered cocktails and it took over 40 minutes for them to come. We also ordered food and this came out before the cocktails. So overall the service was a big disappointment, but this is something they can easily fix.   When we finally got the cocktails they were awesome! We tried 3 different ones and loved them all. For the food we had a wedge salad, wings, fries, and oysters. Fries and wings were ok, and the salad and oysters were great.   Overall. Cool spot for sure. Great spot for drinks (if you have some time), but I'd eat elsewhere.",

Halfway through our second drink the manager asked us to leave our table and finish our drink at the bar because there was a long wait. I was shocked since Crunkleton prides itself on service. Don't sit us at a table if you plan to rush us out. I might go again for a drink but probably no more than that. I'm sad I wasted $10 on a membership.

    "text": "I can't compare, as others have done, to the location in Chapel Hill.  We arrived just prior to 6 pm Friday night. We knew they didn't take reservations and had tried to get there earlier so our party of 4 could enjoy a cocktail at the bar prior to getting a table. We missed that by probably an hour based on the packed bar. There were a few of their larger tables empty and we \"hoped\" we wouldn't be told a wait that was so long we'd decide to go elsewhere. Lucky us, we were just in time to be seated at the last table available. We did have to pay $10 membership fee each for two of us. You have to fill out a form and pay $10. Each member can bring one guest. Not sure how I feel about that but honestly it is what it is. Once seated, our server described the concept and helped us select cocktails. I chose their version of the Old fashioned. ( as noted by one of my friends, it's a big girl drink ). After drink orders, the server came back and described the fish and steak specials. We ordered a lot of the menu. And I do think the server thought we were crazy for the amount of food for 4 people. We ordered the Wedge salad, the Hearth Charred Wings, Tobacco Tamales, the fish special which was red snapper and for sides we ordered the Mushrooms and Walnuts and also the Sea Island Peas and Rice. And we also ordered the 36 oz Tomahawk Ribeye. Everything came out as it was ready so we basically we kept getting dishes delivered almost every few minutes with the 2 entrees being delivered last. I'd say the highlights were the Wedge Salad, the wings and obviously the Tomahawk Ribeye. But everything else was good and the chef delivered several dishes and stopped back by to ask about our dinner.  The Tomahawk is huge and certainly got the attention of other people in the restaurant. The veggies that come with it are delightful and I'd recommend cutting a bite of steak and placing it on the bread. A Ribeye is a fattier cut of steak and it kind of melts in your mouth on the bread. Ok. Enough about the Tomahawk because now I am craving leftovers and someone else took them home. I'd say everything about my experience was great. Several of us ordered an additional cocktail and we also had a bottle of red wine. (I can't even begin to remember what the wine was called, food coma was setting in) They haven't been open that long and the only thing that indicates they must be still working things out is......no dessert yet. Bummer because knowing us, we'd have ordered at least 3.  One last thing about the Tomahawk, it's $110 so definitely have 3-4 people that want to share. We didn't flinch at the price because there was 4 of us and we were splitting everything. But someone did comment \"I have never spent $100 on an entree.\"   My final Recommendation is to get there early for a table or plan to wait. I think there are only 8 tables, maybe 9. It was even more crowded when we left and I could tell by the end they wanted to turn our table.",
