    "text": "I will start by saying the pizza at Mellow Mushroom is good and they have a good beer selection. However, we will not be going back any time soon because of the crappy service and terrible atmosphere. We were there Sunday evening around 5:30 and were seated right away. As we were there we saw kid after kid come in. It was like being in Chuck E. Cheese. There were even kids in the bar area. It was extremely chaotic in there. I don't know if it is always full of kids or this is just a Sunday night thing.  Also, our service was not good. Our server scoffed because we didn't want to keep our dirty salad plates to use with the pizza. He did not check on us a single time after we got our pizza, never refilled a drink. When he brought us the check he didn't say a word.  I'll stick with Revolution in NoDa.",

    "text": "So I walked in for a semi late lunch with a friend because we were having trouble deciding where to go and ended up here. Well I was ready to walk back out after standing around waiting to get a table in the dead empty restaurant.  But right before I could make that suggestion someone walked out of the kitchen and offered to show us to a table, okay fine. Sitting outside on the patio it took a solid 5 minutes for someone else to show up and offer us drinks, then another 5 to get menus. Now I wasn't in a hurry on this particular day, but most people are on a time limit for lunch and would not appreciate this kind of service. I'm kind of shocked by the prices here 20+ dollars for a pizza is a bit expensive. So I opted to try a sandwich for $12. I selected a tempeh sandwich which theoretically sounded good on the menu but after it arrived and a couple bites I took out all the tempeh which tasted quite sour and rancid and just dumped a bunch of parmesan and pepper on the remaining lettuce, and tomato and ate it like that. During this whole time no one came by to refill water, ask how I was doing, if I liked my food, or if I would like the check.  I don't really care to come by here again after this sloppy experience I don't really plan on returning, even if their pizza is amazingly out of this world.",

    "text": "I have loved Mellow Mushroom since my first bite about 10 years ago. Coming down south to visit family and getting to have MM pizza has always been a very special treat since their franchises haven't made it far enough north yet. But now that I've moved to Charlotte and am less than 10 miles, I was fearful that my MM memories would be crushed. It took me about a month to finally gain the courage to go, and this location DID NOT disappoint! I'm a huge fan of the pretzels, but opted for the muffuletta bread app instead. It was delicious, and not lacking in the olive area. It came out a little colder than I would have liked, but it was tasty enough that temperature wasn't a deal breaker. Our pizza came out quickly, piping hot, and perfectly correct despite our make your own pizza order being somewhat excessive. Our server didn't complain about our lengthy order. In fact, she was impressed by my creation and even complimented us on developing a pizza that, to her, sounded \"really incredibly good!\" The crust is always the best part, chewy, flavorful, and with just the right crunch. If I had to say anything negative at all, it would be that the shrimp was overcooked; however, a pizza oven cannot really be considered the best vessel for making perfectly prepared shellfish. I'm going to have to try to forget how close this MM is for the sake of my waistline, but I can say with certainty that we will be back!",

The bottom of my pizza was completely burned and the pizza was so greasy the toppings were falling off.  I know this isn't the usual experience at Mellow Mushroom, so let's just caulk this up to growing pains.  My next visit I decided to sit at the bar because it was a Friday night and there was almost an hour wait for a table.  I didn't realize Friday night is kids eat free night, it was more like a Chuck E Cheese than a Mellow Mushroom.  There were actually two little girls with their babydolls sitting beside me at the bar.  I am happy to report the pizza was great this go around, but I'm still not sure this location has found their groove like the Asheville and Charleston locations have.",

    "text": "Yay, Mellow Mushroom is back!    Eating here is a really fun experience.  This one is actually a bit more fancy on the inside than the Asheville or Boone locations, but it's in a fancy part of town.  Fancy other than the mushrooms growing out of the booths and the bus parked right inside, with booths and names scratched in the paint.    The menu is downright chatty and kind of makes me laugh.  It's got starters - oh, excuse me, \"munchies\", salads, hoagies, and of course pizzas and calzones.  All of which are customizable.  Just choose a base, a sauce, cheese, veggies, and protein.  And some of the protein is not animal based for the vegetarian crowd.  There are also several sauces to choose from, not just your standard red sauce.  You can also choose from pesto, olive oil and garlic, or barbecue.    The quality of the ingredients is the best part.  I've never had anything from Mellow Mushroom in any city that wasn't delicious.  I'm not into fancy pizzas so I always just go for the standard pepperoni and olives.  The cheesy bread is magic, and the spinach and artichoke dip is creamy and comes with crostini for dipping.  I don't know exactly what kind of bread they use but it's really good.    They also feature an extensive beer list to go along with their extensive list of ingredients.  Nothing goes with pizza like beer!  Get your beer and pizza (or calzone, or salad, or hoagie) at Mellow Mushroom and you won't be sorry!",

    "text": "Mellow Mushroom sticks out in the Myer's Park neighborhood for all the right reasons- laid back atmosphere with pleasant service, a casual family-friendly environment with colorful decor, and it's deliciously scrumptious pizza.   When entering the restaraunt, I immediately notice the vibrantly colored murals, the bright bubbling lava lamps over the bar, and the many flat screen tv's that line the walls (there's even tv's on the patio!). If you enjoy a relaxed environment where you can catch the game, race, or even the news while enjoying a beer, this is the place for you. With ample seating,  this  Mushroom offers quite a spacious environment. I noticed several large groups sitting toward the back of the restaraunt (under the festival murals), which told me they are capable of catering to birthday parties, and social gatherings. If you have children that are easily fascinated, the \"magic bus\" will be your first choice seating arrangement- and you can't miss it! It's a REAL schoolbus that was painted and overhauled to fit tables. Be forewarned, they do NOT offer reservations, but the hostess took our names, gave us a buzzer and we were seated in 20 minutes(Granted, we went on a weekend night). Despite having to wait, the staff we encountered were very pleasant, and seemed to enjoy doing their job!  Now- the best part- the food and drink:  The menu offered several choices of appetizers (pretzels, spinach dip, hummus, caprisse, wings, etc). We chose to try the spinach dip, which came to our table bubbling hot from the oven, served with crispy garlic toast points. It was gooey, cheesy, and nothing short of incredible, most importantly- the spinach and chunks of artichoke were fresh, along with the layer of shaved parmesean that came on top. Sooo good.   While we pondered the rest of the menu, I embarked on the beer list. If you like good, high quality beers and microbrews, the beer list is a gem. The drink specials they offer are quite reasonable, considering most of the beer IS craft brew. Tonight they were offering Abita pints (their featured brewery of the month) for $3.50 and $11 pitchers. Knowing our own thirsts, we settled on a pitcher, which went quite swimmingly with our meal.  If you like a thin, greasy, foldable triangle slice, this ain't NY. The crust is hand tossed, the toppings are all fresh, and the pizza is baked to order. That being said, you'll wait a humble conversation or music-filled 30 mnutes for a pizza if it's very busy. Understandable, because this isn't Domino's or Little Caesar's- I saw at least five people tossing dough in the kitchen, and two others pulling pizzas out of the oven. That tells me enough. And the wait was well worth it! The crust was a nice brown (but it's NOT a wheat crust, i was told). They brush their yummy crust in garlic butter and parmesean cheese, which can only be good! The cheese was practically dripping off each slice, and the toppings were a-plenty. We got the philosopher's pie- complete with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, feta, provolone, mozz, and steak. It was every bit of delicious that our server promised us it would be  The best thing a pizza place can offer is variety and options. They offer a gluten free crust and a list of gluten free ingredients, and if you prefer, vegan cheese. If you want to modify or build your own pie from the ground up, you can do it here. They will accomidate it all!  Based on this experience, I'm definitely coming back. Next time, for lunch. Though it's not advertised on the menu- this particular mellow has lunch specials (a mere $5.95 for two slices+drink or a slice+salad+drink, if you prefer!!). If ya haven't jumped on the bus yet man, you better hurry up!",

The places along Selwyn have been sprouting up left and right so the area is pretty nice to spend an evening in.  Never-the-less, I was super hungry when I parked and ventured in with a friend.  It was a Tuesday night so there were a ton of tables available (none in the bus though :(  oh well).  Tuesday nights is apparently trivia night so we walked in halfway through the 2nd round of questions.  It was actually kind of fun racking our brains for the answers (while we were waiting on our food) but not really playing at the same time.  I ordered the 10\" Kosmic Karma... man was it good.  All the pizza is baked to order so it may be a wait for the food - SO WORTH IT THOUGH.  To entertain you, you could probably order an appetizer or sample their extensive beer selection.  The staff seemed to be a mixture of people and very laid back.... don't expect quick service here, but I guess the lackadaisical service adds to the mood of the place.  I didn't really mind it too much.  The only downside I did take note of was the noise level of the restaurant... granted there was trivia going on so there wasn't any music playing but maybe it was a combo of the HVAC, the kitchen, and all the conversations around us....",

That's exactly7 what we found here.  Our server, Ashley B. was the sweetest, upbeat, knowledgeable, most awesome girl we could have gotten.  She knew the menu inside out and the beer selections as well.  When my husband and I were asking  questions about different beers she knew all about them and even brought us little samples to try.  We ordered 2 pizzas.  They were absolutely delicious.  All of the toppings, sauce and cheese were fresh, perfect and so tasty!!!!    I love the atmosphere here and cannot wait to bring the whole family back again soon for another visit.",

The dough is different than anything else I've tasted.  It almost tastes like pretzel dough.  The only thing that was weird was the table configuration. I was with a group of 8 people.  We were seated in a big booth with 2 tables and a walking space between the two tables. It made conversation to the other table difficult since the restaurant was so loud.  Other things I love about this is the decor at the bar...there are lava lamps on the wall behind the bar.  Very Cool!!",

We decided to be adventurous and try a pie we'd never had, the red potato pie.  It was fantastic!  Who would have thought potatoes would be good on pizza?!    a world to the wise, the pretzels aren't pretzels, they are pizza dough in the shape of the pretzels, which was disappointing since i'm a huge pretzel fan.    We ended up so full from the pizza dough pretzels that we each only managed a slice of pizza!    The beer list was a little weak, but I expect it will get better once they are open longer.",

On a beautiful day, you cannot beat sitting on Selwyn, watching one of the tvs, and enjoying the sun.

When taking our order, our server (never gave us her name) wrote on her hand. Not exactly the best tool to use as she forgot parts of our order which never made it to the table. Had to ask several times and waited more than 15 minutes for plates and napkins. Didn't get them so I had to go up to the counter, only to see her chatting with a coworker. Our server was pretty much oblivious. I will go back to this location as the food is always great but will ask for another server next time.",

I think pizza is the only thing that stands in my way of looking as trim as Brad Pitt.  Okay I'm lying.  It's the Calzones too.  The thing that sets Mellow apart from others is the crust.  If you love a great steamy hot pizza with a nice crisp crust and not burnt at the edges, it's your kinda pie.  The edges are buttery and sprinkled with parmesean.  It's absolutely addictive.    The staff is extremely friendly and you just have that feel of being in sort of a hippie joint where everyone is chill.  The porch is fantastic and we try to sit out there as often as possible.

The bright lights in your face, no garlic on the table, and unabsorbent logo-bedecked recycley napkins will remind you where you are (a chain) and what the original once was (VW van booths, well built specialty pies, regional beer selection). A good place to eat in if you're a breeder. Might be better off with take-out if not.",

I've stopped in on occasion for dinner and always end up getting the pizza... ummm... it's MM... that's what they are known for.   The pizzas can be a bit pricier but look at the menu and you'll see why. The larges are indeed quite large and comes with toppings aplenty! Worth the price. You can get your typically pepperoni, veggies and whatever else here but I adore a pizza parlor that tops their pies with a variety of sauces as well, like the pesto swirl. If you're a mushroom fan, grab the holy shiitake pie - topped with mushrooms, onions, garlic aioli and black truffle oil - whaaaat?!  The draft selection is extensive as well and the last time I went Mellow was doing a pint night with Sam Adams... good beer and a free glass? Two, please.   The service is excellent. From the host to the server to the management, all I've ever received has been supreme customer service. Nice job, Mellow. I need to swing by and see you all soon!",

Very cute 60's disco like decor 2. There is even a car used as decoration inside the restaurant! 3. Excellent waiter/ staff services like other reviewers have said 4. Food arrived fairly quickly, but pizzas and subs and sandwiches shouldn't take too long to make 5. The biggest drawback for me is the food. We tried several subs here and they are all mediocre. This is so sad because I've definitely had better food at other mellow locations 6. I requested more mayo and ketchup for my sandwich and they were very willing to bring it out. My friend wanted a different flavor of chips and they brought out another bag for her while letting her keep her original bag. 7. All in all, if I were just to rate my dining experience, this place will be a 5. However, taking into consideration with the food, 3.5 stars.",

As a vegetarian, I enjoy the avocado hoagie & the Kosmic Karma pizza. If you're eating clean, this is not the place for you. If you are like me & easily tempted by the awesomeness of dough, stay clear of MM!  This MM is a nice size with a space for outdoor seating. We've never had to wait for a table. However, I will say that the service, once we are seated, is never fast. If you're in a rush, pick another place.

I've stopped in here on several occasions for a beer at the bar, dinner with a group of 12 people and lunch with friends. Each time has been a pleasurable experience.   The staff does an exemplary job of seating, serving and managing the entire dining room. I've always loved the personalities of each staff member. Very easy to connect and they make the meal fun. Fast and easy.   Draft beers aplenty at this establishment, folks. There are tons of local brews to choose from. My favorite? Abita root beer. Though there are not free refills, it is the best experience watching a frosty mug filled with delicious root beer on draught. Just a cool novelty to go along with your 'za!  The food, I mean....come on. It's pizzza. What's not to love? The crust is a bit darker and wheaty than others. A little heartier and stands up to loads of toppings with ease. The calzones, salads and sandwiches are great, too. Calzones are big enough to split for two people, or one ambitiously hungry diner. Everything was great. Also, splitting a large between two people always garners two slices to be taken home. A note for those who like leftovers: reheat in the oven. The microwave will kill that delicious crust!  Glad to have MM in Selwyn. Keep up the great work!",

I have been on a quest to find amazing pizza in Charlotte, and I can say that this place has the best pizza I've eaten so far.  What makes their pizza so amazing, you might ask?  First off, their crust is scrumptious!  It's part whole wheat, and it has a great, chewy texture.  The wheat gives it such a great flavor.  And secondly, they have such a plethora of toppings you can add.  You can get several different types of cheeses, meats, veggies, and even fruit.  I've got to say, that's pretty wicked awesome.  Finally, at certain times of the day, you can get pizza by the slice.  And I'm not just talking about one tiny slice - the slices are giant!  It's like eating a quarter of a large pizza (well, not quite, but you get my point, I hope).  And it's not just some pre-made slice, you can choose what toppings you add to your pizza.  What a stellar idea!  They have several vegetarian options, and they even have a selection of gluten free pizza offerings too!    Besides pizza, they have appetizers, salads, and even calzones.  They also have a large selection of beers, and apparently you can join their beer club to get rewards.  How awesome is that?  And in addition to great food, the decor is all trippin' in there.  They psychedelic theme permeates the tables, walls, and bar area.  They even have an old hippie bus all decorated up, with booths you can sit at in there.  We had great service there, and our server was so enthusiastic.  Their prices are a little higher than other pizza places, but the quality is outstanding.  And if you get pizza by the slice, you can get a large slice with multiple toppings for less than $5.  It's very filling.  Oh yes, I will definitely be back here.",

I alway eat a slice of whatever my friends and family order when we come here and I never can complain. Their pizza is hot, have a nice favor to it and not greasy.  However, one of my all time favorite thing on their menu is the bruschetta. I dream and crave for it all the time. Their freshly diced, not watery tomatoes, basil and seasoning tossed in a balsamic vinegar. Topped with feta cheese and fresh basil on a nicely, heavenly garlic toast and don't forget the icing which is drizzled balsamic glaze. Whatever they're doing. The tomatoes alway taste like it's in season. And the balsamic glaze make it a little sweet. Omg, writing about it make my mouth water and I just had it today. If I can buy their recipe, I totally would. Love it.  They let you know off the back, their pizza takes time because its made to order. You literally get hit in the face with that sign. They salad is huge. I order their \"lil\" Caesar salad. Which is good but it's big enough for 2 1/2 ppl to share.    From what I heard, Mellow Mushrooms went away for awhile. Well, I'm glad it's back and hope they will stay. Nice place for kids and of course the hipsters. Will definitely be back for more bruschetta.",

    "text": "I used to love MM, but they just seem to continue to go downhill.  I took some guests out to lunch there, on a slow day when there were a total of 3 other tables there, and STILL received \"so-so\" food and service.    First, not only did our cheese bread app take forever, but when it finally came, it was cold and dry.  And we couldn't even eat it until the waiter decided to finally bring plates and utensils.  Why this was not done right away, or anytime during the 25 minute wait, I don't know.  I actually got up to go get stuff for us to eat it with, along with salt and pepper that was also not on the table, and as I was coming back to the table, the pizzas were arriving.  WTH?  There were seriously THREE tables in the whole place...thats not even acceptible when a place is actually busy!  And if your app comes within like 3-5 minutes of your appetizer, it should be free!    Then, we specifically ordered our pizzas with extra cheese because this place has been very light handed with it in the past.  Not only was there still not much cheese on it, but one pizza was burnt, while the other was still doughy.  Gross.  Too pricey a pizza for what you get. I'm gonna have to throw in the towel on wasting anymore time or money here.",

Fans of White Zombie beer by Catawba Brewing Co will be glad to hear that both locations keep this yumminess on tap!  I've also discovered a delicious white wine here called Conundrum. So creamy and rich!   They have a fairly straight forward menu but can do almost anything with pizza.  The crust here is my absolute favorite in town. It is right down the middle between thick and thin, has a hint of sweetness, and perfect proportions of crunch and chew. They also do great salads with a huge selection of toppings.   Parking can seem tricky at first but there's plenty behind and under the Selwyn location. Staff is friendly, and they do a nice bingo and trivia.   Welcome back, MM, and keep it coming with the great pizza and brews!",

    "text": "Groovy dude... A kitschy, franchise pizzeria that makes totally funkadelic (and awesome) pizzas with a great beer selection. We've been Mellow fans since living in Denver and we were psyched to see that there was a Mellow on Selwyn. The portabella mushroom appetizer is awesome and could totally be an entree. It's a large portabella mushroom cap baked with artichokes, feta and sundried tomatoes served on top of spring greens with a balsamic reduction. Our favorite pizza is the Maui Wowie pizza. This pizza is loaded with toppings. I highly recommend subbing the banana peppers for candied jalapenos. Those candied jalapenos up the spice level and compliment the pizza really well. The pizzas seem pricey but when you see what comes out you'll see it's money well spent. I love their crust. Perfect texture, slightly sweet taste... Brushed with butter and sprinkled with parm. Divine.  Helpful Tips: - Parking is never a problem. If the top deck is full, head down to the garage. - Service has always been good at this location. - They can easily accommodate large groups.  - They have TVs in the bar that are always tuned to sports.  - If you frequent the Mellow, make sure you join the Beer Club.  - This location offers GFree, vegan crusts",

Half of one of the pizzas was only dough with no sauce or toppings at all! And for $30 a piece you'd hope you were getting all 3 toppings you ordered, but we did not and had to drive back and wait around for a new one. Yes, yes I know the decor inside is cute, but so what?!?! I can't eat the bus or decorations! Don't waste your time or money, just down the road is Portofinos and they know how to make pizzas. We only came here because we do not eat dairy and Mellow Mushroom does offer vegan cheese. Next time we'll just order from Portofinos or Hawthornes and add our own Daiya cheese at home. They're getting 3 stars because they did replace the messed up pizza.",

They have the usual hippie-tastic decor coating every inch... there's even a full-sized tye-dyed bus you can eat in (inside the restaurant!)  Mellow will always hold a place in my heart for two reasons: The crust on their pizza pies is hearty (a partial whole wheat mix I believe?) AND they have a huge topping selection! My favorite combinations: 1-Feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. 2-Jerk tofu and onion.... mmmmm.  Cons:  Weekend evenings at this location are insane, you WILL have to wait to be seated because this place get's packed.  My only other complaint is that the prices are a bit steep.  Pros:   Very good, attentive staff here. Pretty good beer on tap selection. Lots of vegan and vegetarian friendly options, discounted menu after 10pm....  Yep Yelpers, you heard that right! Come to this Mellow after 10pm and you get an awesome deal: Pizza Slices are - $1.50 + 25 cents per topping (50 cents for the fancier ones). This is a great deal!!! The slices are huge.  They also have a late night appetizer deal: Bruschetta, Spinach Artichoke Dip, or Hummus... ALL ONLY $3 each for a full order!  My favorite is the hummus, but all 3 are yummy.",

While I love the decor inside, the staff is just OK. We've had to wait a long time to even get our pizza. However, any time we've ordered it to go, it's ready & waiting for us, after the 15 minute trip over there to pick it up. The inside service is pretty slow, even if they aren't busy.  So for the pizza itself...it's yummy. The slices are huge & mama mia, the toppings are plentiful (which I love).  Again, sometimes the pizza is better than other times.  Families LOVE this location, so if you don't like kids, you're best to get your order to go.  Like Nicole, I've been to plenty locations, really almost every one in NC.  Charlotte though has some catching up to do to be on the level of the other locations.",

I literally jumped for joy when I learned they were coming back. Simply put, you will not find a better pizza period. The only detractor is that is very pricey for a pizza and the menu can be a bit overwhelming. Their calzones are also top notch. Another great thing about Mellow Mushroom is the variety of beer. I am sort of a beer snob and enjoy many craft beers. Mellow Mushroom always seems to have something I have not yet tried. If you have never been, you need to go yesterday.",

    "text": "One of the stars I gave Mellow Mushroom may have just been because I was so excited to see it come back to Charlotte.  I shed many tears when the previous franchiser closed down his doors while trying to break away and open Moon Dog.  Bleh.  I have had three great experiences so far at the new Mellow Mushroom in Myers Park.  Going exclusively on Friday or Saturday night, I've never actually had to wait more than 10-15 minutes.  The staff is working hard to get people seated and keep people informed of their wait.  The bar area is nice and open, although it would be nice to have a little bit more space to congregate, rather than backing up onto tables if you're two deep at the bar.  They have great selections on draught beer.  I was excited to see that they had a lot of North Carolina beer on tap like Big Boss and OMB.  The food is pretty consistent with what you love and know from Mellow Mushroom.  I think they still have some kinks to work out with their pricing and/or the waitstaff's knowledge of how to key things in.  For Example:  Got a cheese calzone with buffalo chicken in it (effectively a buffalo chicken calzone).  The first time I was charged correctly ($7.95 for a cheese calzone + $2 for buffalo chicken), second time not so much ($11.95 for a chicken calzone? + $2 for buffalo chicken).  I didn't realize the mistake until later, but consistency should come through experience over there.  Overall, excited to have MM back in Charlotte!",

This place was a bit more kid friendly than I anticipated.  I almost felt like I was at a Chucky Cheeses because practically every table had 2 or more small children.  And don't even try getting a table on the magic mushroom bus in the middle of the dining area because it's packed with kids.  Not that I'm anti-kids, I just felt out of place without any little people at our table.  They have a large outdoor patio that looks nice but unfortunately it was too cold to go outside during our visit.  We will be back, but maybe at a later hour for a more adult dinner.",

    "text": "I debated with giving Mellow Mushroom a 4 star, but I definitely think it is a 3.5.  Charlotte is lacking in the \"great\" pizza department, but Mellow comes close.  Let the analysis begin:  Food:  Mellow Mushroom has many creative dishes and goes beyond just pizza.  Their salads and apps are excellent.  They also have calzones  (I think they are a better value than the pizza if you are going for an individual).  Most recently I got the Philospher's pie (steak!) and hummus - which were both tasty!  Ambiance:  this operation is a little more done up than some of the other MMs I've been to.  They have a colorful bus and many interesting things to look at.  I specifically enjoyed the little springy mushrooms by the booths.  They move and bounce, try it out.  Location:  location in Myer's Park is excellent, one of my favorite little areas near Selwyn Pub and Yoforia!!  Perfect for post mellow drinks or desert.  Service:  the service wasn't outstanding.  I ran out of water and never got a refill and was extremely thirsty!  Final Comments:  MM is not your typical pizza place.  It has it's own little niche in the world of pizza that I can appreciate, is customizable and a general crowd pleaser.",

    "text": "I was recently invited to check out Mellow Mushroom at its Selwyn Avenue location in Charlotte. Although I have seen Mellow Mushroom locations in both Charlotte and Atlanta, somehow I had never before tried it. There are actually locations in more than 15 states including another Charlotte location in Ballantyne. The Selwyn location of Mellow Mushroom boasts a large bar and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating including a groovy decked out school bus with booths inside! Although the focus is on pizza, the menu varies including Greek, Caesar and Chef salads as well as an option to create your own salad with all sorts of protein and topping additions. Additionally, a large number of hoagies are offered such as jerk chicken, mushroom club, spiked sausage and shrimp hoag'boy. Vegetarians will find plenty of options including 5 veggie hoagies - the tempeh came highly recommended - and lots of salad and pizza options. Munchies such as the famous pretzels, stuffed portobello mushroom, meatballs, wings, hummus and Muffuletta cheese bread round out the mix. Pizza and calzones are offered in specialty varieties and their is an option to build your own as well.  We started with bruschetta, a nicely executed version with basil and feta served on crisp garlic toast points with balsamic glaze, definitely a solid choice. Our wonderful waitress also recommended the stuffed portobello mushroom, which I will have to try next time. For pizza we opted to try 4 different specialty varieties by ordering half and half on 2 10\" pies. The pizza is not too thin or too thick - a nice medium body crust - and you can tell it is fresh. I also enjoyed the addition of cheese around the crust's edge.  At this location only, there are three location-specific specialty pizzas available. We tried both the Black and Blue: olive oil and garlic based pie topped with blackened steak, crumbled bleu cheese, mushrooms and onions and the Umami (my personal favorite): candied jalepeno slices, pineapple, Applewood smoked bacon, fresh mozzarella, feta and caramelized onion, topped with basil. Wow, need I say more? Umami is considered to be the fifth taste - savory - which includes such a good combination of the four other tastes (sweet, sour, salty and bitter) that it requires its own unique name. The word comes from Japanese and means \"pleasant savory taste\".  We also tried the Holy Shiitake Pie, which includes Shiitake, button and portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, mozzarella and Montamore cheeses with garlic aioli and black truffle oil on top. This was a close second for me - definitely a lot of great mushroom flavor and the aioli really adds an extra special touch. The Red Skin Potato pie, our final pizza selection was tasty although I would ask for the sour cream and spicy ranch on the side next time as I felt they overpowered the delicious potato flavor. This pie also has bacon, caramelized onions, cheddar and mozzarella - yum!  We tried a salad as well - the Enlightened Spinach Salad, which includes feta, dried cherries, apples and pecans. The homemade signature Esparanza dressing was delicious - definitely a must try and also good with pizza crust! We also tried the tempeh hoagie - a good flavor and lots of veggies make this a wise choice for the non-meat eating crowd.  For dessert we ordered the pretzels with honey/cinnamon sugar and the chocolate chip cookie. The pretzels (also available as a starter with garlic butter and parmesan or with butter, salt and mustard) are made from the pizza dough and are absolutely delicious. I had to get these and the cookie to go since I was already stuffed but I'm glad I tried them - definitely a treat.  Mellow Mushroom is a fun place for the entire family. Live music and trivia are offered weekly and the patio will be perfect for the upcoming fall weather. I suggest you give Mellow Mushroom a try. Let me know what you think!",

    "text": "When you wander in off the street in the middle of the afternoon, it's a pleasure to find a place where you're treated well, the drinks are cold, and the food is good.  Nor was it obvious that it was a pizza place. (That is the only menu item, aside from a few calzone choices.) Fortunately, for the purposes of this review, my wife and I consider pizza as one of the three essential food groups.  We ordered our drinks first, and were well into happy mode when we opened the menu and found the pizza-only offerings. Hey, we're not purists, but maybe a few choices?  We ordered a medium Hawaiian and took a few minutes checking out the decor. The place is well-appointed in muted 60s psychedelic with plaster mushrooms and a painted school bus right out of the Partridge Family.  The waitress kept an eye on our booze, and was prompt in suggesting another round when the glasses got a little low.  The pizza arrived in good time, and I deemed it worthy. The toppings were plentiful and the crust was above average in flavor.  The only food negative was the crust was overdone -- a little too dark on the bottom and around the edge. Which brings us to the next problem; the pizza wasn't cut all the way through. Tear the pieces off by hand. Hot pieces, with cheese.  Wipe your hands and pick up the fork for the first bite. It was the cheap stainless flatware that is so thin, the edge cuts into your hand.  Minor irritants, for sure; but irritants nonetheless.  But by then, physics had taken over and the slice was cool enough to pick up and bite as God intended.  Good Pizza, reasonably priced at $14 to $19 for a 14-inch medium!   Lots of flavor with lots of topping. We'll be back.",

    "text": "So I just moved here from Philadelphia, and had never heard of Mellow Mushroom til a native down here recommended we check it out one night. SO DELICIOUS !!!! I was  blown away by how the chefs are able to completely transform even the most basic pizza by adding their special ingrediants and flavor! :) For example, the Mediterranean pizza REALLY tastes like a Gyro! And the Mexican South of the Border Pizza really captures the taste of Mexican cuisine. Every pizza is so dramatically different and unique. There is something for everyone, vegetarians included. I cannot say enough good things about this place, I went there three times last week so that should speak for itself.. Safe to say this is one of my favorite things about the South sofar :) My friends up north are missing out!  If you haven't been here and you live down south.. What are you waiting for? They are everywhere around here, so check them out! Enjoy!",

My daughter absolutely loved the bus and the fact we could dine inside of it Perfect, good atmosphere and entertaining my 3 year old.   We started with the Brushetta app.  This Brushetta is perfect for me.  It is served with feta and a balsamic glaze.  I will go back for this alone. I am from NY and love my pizza so with that being said their pizza is a little different than the tradition NY style I am use to.  They have a sweeter crust and it is a bit thicker than my liking.  We did get the house pizza which came with a generous amount of toppings.  The pizza was good but it is not the best I have ever had.   The beer selection was huge which was great, I ordered 2 of the \"dirty hippy\" beers they had on the menu.  This was actually really good, it was Sweet Water 420 layered with Guinness VERY TASTY!   I will be definitely be back and recommend everyone to try it out if they have never been to a Mellow Mushroom.",

My husband and I decided to go there last night for dinner to check it out.    Pros: Food is yummy!  Our pizza and calzone were delicious!  Cons: Service is crap-  Our server barely spoke to us and when he brought us our drinks he sat there and held them waiting for us to take them out of his hands??  Weird..  I was in the middle of eating my salad..??  He was the most unpleasant person I've met in a while.    Way too many kids!  I saw a couple comments about this below as well, so I know it's not just me!  It definitely felt like Chucky Cheese!  It was loud with kids yelling and screaming and running up and down the aisle.  Whatever you do, don't let the server seat you in the bus if you don't have kids!  That is the like the Chucky Cheese playground! Eeek!  Overall,  good place if you don't mind being surrounded by kids.  Food is good, and service needs some serious help!  We might go back, but we'll definitely be sitting at the bar next time!",

If you're looking for unique pizzas on fluffy, gooey dough while wrapped up in an atmosphere that is \"groovy, man\" you've hit the pizza lover's jack pot.  Each Mellow Mushroom is uniquely decorated and this one is one of my favorites.  A fun atmosphere where you can eat inside an old school  bus, or sit at the bar and watch lava lamps do their thing.  The service is always on time and the food is delicious.  Only here can you get one of a kind pizzas such as the \"boozer\" which is made with beer cheese, ham, bacon and chicken.    This visit would have received 5 stars, but we went on a Sunday night and they were out of some of the ingredients (fresh mozzarella) to make one of the apps we ordered as well as a few beer selections.  Nevertheless, what we did get was yummy!  I recommend starting off with the meatball trio and the parmesan pretzels.  You will not be disappointed!",

I'm not usually a fan of bruschetta because the hard bread kills the roof of my mouth - but I thought I'd give this a shot.  It was delish.  The flavoring was amazing and the bread just right.  We also got a Meat Pizza.  We ate half of it and the other half some how ended up on the floor, slipping off the pizza stand.  We were devastated as the late night snack was something we were looking forward to!

Having said that, I still love mellow mushroom, wherever it is but can tell the differences immediately.  The sauce tasted sweeter than I remember but it was still good.  We split the lil' Caesar salad, ham & pineapple calzone & the honey-cinnamon pretzels.  All very good.  I also love their pizzas.  We usually get two calzones and take home leftovers because we love it so much.  It was a Tuesday night, apparently trivia night.  It wasn't too crowded, but most tables were playing along in teams.  They have many themed nights, so something to check out if you want entertainment with your meal.    I loved the layout of the restaurant and bar area.  The decor is typical mushroom style.  Love the selection of beers on tap and always ask the server for the special taps not on the menu.  Our server was very knowledgable in helping us select a new brew to try and he was very nice and attentive.    If you're in the area, stop and grab some great pizza.  If you're not in the are drive on down, it is worth it.",

I'm still perplexed why they left given the crowd that was there on a Friday night but image they will be staying for years to come. They don't take reservations and the place was packed which made it a bit hard to get a drink at the bar but the service was quick (thank you bartender for scanning my ID for more than five seconds, you don't know how much that boosted my ego). Tons and tons of beer on tap plus beer specials of the day which allowed me to try some I've never heard of before.   Like other locations, they have the psychedelic bus plus booths, tables and extra big wrap around booths with a backdrop of Woodstock. Service was great but the big dilemma was what to order. I am partial to their Magical Mystery Tour but was thinking about their Kosmic Karma but the Tour yet again won my heart. One o the girls I was with is vegan and they even had options for her--score! The crowd (which I found it amusing that it was packed full of yuppies) seemed to dwindle down around 815P so if you're not looking to wait long, may be a better option to wait a little for dinner. They have a huge patio area which faces Selwyn where you can watch the cars pass or drunkards of Selwyn Pub, I imagine myself coming back in the summer time to enjoy that. All in all, lived up to my expectations and then some of past Mellow visits and looking forward to my next visit!",

Although, a little over priced for pizza(IMO), its damn good and honestly its not that bad $ wise.  Also, they've added a few menu items that are all worth checking out.  Not to mention they've done a few things to bring in the crowds.  A $3 pint night on Mondays and I've heard they're doing a movie night as well.  Don't know if they are kid friendly movies though.  A Shrek/Nemo matinee when schools out for the summer would kill it.  This is probably the best kid friendly restaurant in town where the parents can actually eat good food and drink good booze.  The environment is very chill and the staff are quite cordial.  I highly recommend the shiitake pie or the Cosmic Karma but you can't really go wrong.  Bottom line:  I feel like I could go on and on about this place but don't know that I need to, just check it out.  Its a hippie themed pizza place with top notch ingredients, a kind vibe, a beautiful outdoor dining area, and overall sense of well being.  Just know that the pies are made to order so be ready to wait 30-45 minutes+ when they are busy.  So grab a beer and app.",

They have great beer selection and a great pizza menu to back it up, but they also have options if you aren't feeling in the pizza mood.  I think I order their sandwiches more than anything.  I've never sat in the bus since the place can get swarming with kids at times.  The bar area is nice.  The place gets crowded at times but aside from a wait for a table I've never had problems with service.",

They recently changed the menu but will still let you order whatever you want (I always get Maui Wowie pizza). Me and my boyfriend were just here last week and our servers name was Eric, and he was also great. He gave us our appetizer which was the soft pretzels- (SO good by the way) for free because we had to wait awhile for them since the first batch came out burnt and he didn't want to give them to us that way.",

    "text": "I went here with the Vegetarian and Vegan Social Group.  There was supposed to be eight of us, but only five showed.  They gave us a smaller table without any negative attitude. I ordered a small Magical Mystery Tour pizza.  It had a pesto base, cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and, most delightfully for me, jalapeno peppers!  It was a good pizza. But, I will tell you the real reason that I am giving Mellow Mushroom five stars.  Number one:  the waiter.  Do you know how hard it is to serve vegans and vegetarians?  We made Meg Ryan's ordering in When Harry Met Sally look like a piece of cake.  \"Can you give me a raw crust?\"  \"Do you have soy free tofu?\"  Ok. I am exaggerating a bit.  But, these folks really did place some detailed orders.  This sweet, patient man actually went back over everyone's order, delivered our pizzas to us and made no mistakes.  Plus, he was pleasant (although I am sure it made for an interesting story to tell his friends). The second reason that Mellow is getting five stars is because of the valet parking staff.  And, I know that they help the whole shopping center, but still.  Nobody called me ma'am, and they were flirty-appreciative with me (in an appropriate way).  They were fast, efficient, and friendly with the taking and delivery of my car.  Refreshing! I want to go back.  Give me the same waiter.  And valet parking please!",

    "text": "We've only been to this Mellow Mushroom about three times.  That's where it's going to stop.  We stopped by this past Saturday night.  For a Saturday, they weren't very busy at all.  Because it was an awesome night, we asked to sit outside.  Most people at the restaurant were outside; there was hardly anyone inside.  That's why it puzzles me that we received awful service and there was no obvious management overseeing the operation.  Our server, Julianna, was extremely inattentive to us and, frankly, couldn't care less that we were there.  I asked her about what a particular beer was like and I could tell she wasn't really listening to me.  She just wrote down that I wanted that beer.  Fine, whatever.  The others ordered water.  She rarely visited our table after that.  When we had been sitting there awhile waiting on our dinner, we had to actually ASK her to refill the water glasses.  One of them was empty, so she took that one to refill, but she didn't even bother with the one that was halfway.  A good server would fill them both.  And I didn't want one, but I was never asked about another beer (or obviously water) either.   The food came out hot and delicious, but it seemed strange there was no offer of Parmesan cheese or red pepper flakes or anything.  There weren't any on any of the tables.  We didn't see her again until we had finished our dinner and asked her for a box for the leftover pizza.  Despite the restaurant being practically dead, it still took her awhile to bring the box, check, etc.  We were just in the restaurant for way too long, especially when our drinks were never refilled.  A manager never came by to see how everything was going.  Nobody seemed to care, and it wasn't even busy (and it was a Saturday night).   Also, during everything, my partner apparently ended up leaving his credit card there (or else it wasn't in the book after she processed the charge).  The next night (Sunday night), we called around 8 PM to see if the card was there because we'd swing by to get it.  The hostess, Victoria, said they were in the \"dinner rush\" and she'd have to take our name and number and have someone call us back.  If their dinner rush was anything like the \"dinner rush\" Saturday night, there was no rush.  And now, here it is Monday as I write this review, and no one ever called us back.  We just reported the credit card as stolen, as basically that's what it was at this point.  We won't be back to Mellow Mushroom.",

The place was not busy and sparsely filled.  We were quickly seated.  For the next ELEVEN minutes, we watched one waiter go to the patio area FIVE times.  We watched a waitress go in the school bus at least THREE times.  All of this happened in the ELEVEN minutes we sat there without a single hello or drink order taken.  We got up and left.  As I passed the guy who sat us, I told him that it would have been nice to even be acknowledged in over ELEVEN minutes. So, we went to the Ballantyne location.  We were quickly seated and out waiter came by in less than one minute.  According to the Ballantyne manager, upon hearing about our Selwyn location visit, they (same owner of all three Charlotte locations) have a target of 30 seconds to greet a customer.  Well, Selwyn location, epic fail on meeting that goal.",

There were no \"thank yous\" even though as I left I said thank you very much. The place was also hot, their air conditioning did not work well. I will never go there again.

They did fix both of the service errors without hesitation. But it wasn't the mellow, smooth experience I've come to expect at a mellow mushroom. The issue with freshness involved overly chewy dough that lacked flavor that MM usually has. The pizza and it's toppings seemed really dry.

Mind you, it was 8pm and the people right in front of us got seated.    We begrudgingly went someplace else. Driving back home, the place is packed.  We walked back in, and asked and they said sure.   We are open.    \"We had a minor issue with a bathroom l, but got it fixed immediately \"  No other explanation was provided.  Sad and poor service all around.",

Kid friendly restaurant as well. Received our food in a timely manner. They offer specials like 5$ pizza on Tuesday and daily lunch specials.",

    "text": "Went to mellow mushroom for the first time last night (after living in CLT for 5 years) and it didn't disappoint. It's still different from a Jersey/philly/nyc pie, but good none the less.   My husband did a make your own, and I opted for the buffalo chicken pizza. As we looked at other patrons, we both went for mediums because the smalls, well they looked too small. There is a huge price jump between the small and the medium on all their pies, like almost $10, which I was surprised by, and honestly not worth the extra price hike. The pizzas came out and they were very tasty, although I think mine could have used a few more minutes in the oven, as it was a little doughy still. But the flavors were good, and there were a decent amount of toppings on each pie.   We will probably be back, but only when we both want the same pizza and then split a medium. $20 a person for a pizza is a little steep in my book.",

Reminded me of the weekends spent cleaning in PA. The decor here can be classfied as eclectic-hippie-industrial. I had the Thai flavored baked wings. My son ordered the vegan artichoke and mushroom pizza. The pizza was okay but the sauce could be improved with maybe an Italian seasoning and some sweet (which happens when tomatoes are slow cooked). The server messed up my Yelp coupon giving me percentage off instead of making my pretzel bites free. She didn't come back after she dropped the bill off. The server was friendly. The pretzel bites came wrong the first time but the staff did a quick refire and corrected it immediately.",

We went last night with a group of friends and my wife and I were the first two there. We put our names in for a table and then went to the bar to grab a drink. I was surprised because it was more than five minutes before the bartender actually addressed us, and there were only about five people at the bar in the first place. The beer menu was crossed through all over the place with beers they no longer had, so I consulted the \"specials\" menu that was a separate flyer. Problem was that they no longer had the beer from the specials menu that I wanted. Womp womp. I ordered something else and got on with my life.  When everyone arrived we got seated quickly and (using my Yelp! check-in) got a free order of bruschetta, which was very good. The table agreed that the bread was firm enough to hold the goods, but soft enough not to slice your mouth open like bruschetta bread at most restaurants. I ended up ordering the Pacific Rim - ham, bacon, onions, pineapple, and jalapenos. So good. I devoured a couple of pieces and saved the other half for a later lunch.   Overall the service was good, outside of the initial neglect at the bar. Food has never been a problem at this location, but they obviously need to work on the beer situation. It's always concerning to see when a national chain has menus that someone has manually 86'd items with a Sharpie... get it together people.",

Yes, PBR is there for all of us premium drinkers, so enjoy.

The ambience was a bit cheesy and corporate, the mushrooms all over the place were fine I suppose, and the magic school bus - but it did seem like it was trying a bit hard to disguise the fact that it is in a cookie-cutter building with no natural ambience.  Honestly, that didnt bother me at all.  I had a nice experience.  I just cannot get over the fact that this is supposedly the best pizza that Charlotte has to offer. I suppose if you like a thick spongy crust with cheese and butter baked into it, this place would be ideal.  For me it is not.  The combinations of toppings offered were not that appealing, though you can make your own.  I just found it quite mediocre.  Lots of flash which doesn`t make up for a crappy crust, a sause without tang, and too much cheese.  Where can a great pizza be found in Charlotte?  Where???",

The first time was on an extremely crowded Saturday night.  The outside patio, the bar, and the restaurant were completely full.  The inside was so noisy that earplugs were just about necessary, so I put our name on request for the outside patio.  They said 10 minutes for an outside seat.  I said that was fine.   After 20 minutes they never called us and the hostess was nowhere to be found so we left.  Also, the waiting area is RIGHT in front of the entrance door and people were constantly trying to get past us and everyone else who was waiting.  What a stupid setup!  The 2nd time we came here about 4:30pm on a Friday afternoon.  Hurray, no waiting!  We were seated outside immediately, however no one came to take our order after 25 minutes.  I left and we told the host about this.  They didn't seem to care.  Looking at the menu, the drinks are very overpriced here.  I won't come back to this place!  It is obviously mismanaged.",

They don't take reservations... okay I understand. They told us good luck and the wait for our large party was going to close to an hour and a half on a Saturday night. I was so disappointed in them loosing our money! The parties bill at Revolution Pizza was very large with pizza and beer for hours! The manager was so rude about the whole situation. He told me I must not understand the restaurant business. Funny thing is I worked in a restaurant for a long time! Sad really. We now take our business to Revolution and if we want The Mellow we will trip it up to Asheville!",

    "text": "I almost feel like Mellow Mushroom tries just a little too hard to be trendy and keep the \"stoner food\" theme going while making it family-friendly at the same time. I will admit, though, the hippie school bus and the mushrooms on springs are a fun novelty that keep me entertained.  But kitschy-ness aside, the food is pretty darn good. The pizza crusts are chewy without being rubbery, not too thick and not too thin. The topping combinations are certainly interesting - not anything I would have thought to put together on a pizza.  But they work.  I tend to go for the Philosopher's Pie, which features steak, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, olives, mozzarella and feta on an olive oil and garlic sauce. I recently tried one of their sandwiches, too, which make for great lunch fare. Added bonus: Mellow Mushroom can easily appease the vegetarian/vegan diners as well as providing gluten free options (expect a wait for gluten free, though: they take it pretty seriously and clean the kitchen before making gluten free dough to ensure it's safe and truly gluten free).  And the beer list is well developed for a chain, too. Yeah, Bud-Miller-Coors products are there for the unadventurous, but the craft selection is enough to keep most beer fans happy. You get the usual suspects (Bell's, Dogfish Head, Smuttynose, etc) as well as a great selection of local brews too. If it's in, be sure to grab a glass of Catawba Valley Brewing's White Zombie.  Be warned: they are a bit pricey. All said, it's a fun place to gather with friends for pizza and beer.",

And giant mushrooms out front to climb on (which are currently inside the Neighborhood Theater.) I mean, it's not that this location is bad, exactly. And I'm sorry that they carry stigma from another closed-down location. But in my mind, MM is supposed to be fun, quirky, makes you go \"Whoa!\" when you walk in. My reaction was \"This is supposed to be the Mellow Mushroom?\" It's edging on boring, except for the bus, which honestly, took me a minute to even notice.   My food and service were excellent. I'm impressed with their beer selection. The crust was delicious. So, that's good. I just couldn't get over the feeling that I was inside a Ruby Tuesday's or somewhere similarly generic. You'd think, after knowing what kind of reputation they had to live up to, they'd go all out.  I'm not saying I'm never going back, but I'm not going out of my way either. I've seen better.",

    "text": "So I've heard many a good thing about Mellow Mushroom and have been itching to get myself over to the now not-so-new location on Selwyn Ave. Tonight I finally graced the restaurant with my presence.  I was impressed with the sheer size of the restaurant which doesn't look that big from the street, it also wasn't that crowded for a Tuesday night (not that I expected it to be).   I went against the grain and got a salad instead of a pizza (I eat pizza a lot). There were plenty of decent salad choices on the menu, I decided to go Greek (anything with feta screams my name). The waiter recommended the Esperanza dressing so I went for it, and thank goodness for that! The salad itself was H-UGE (the regular is more than enough for leftovers) and the dressing was perhaps some one of the most scrumptious I've had - definitely get it if you go.  The only downside was the wait for the checks. And if that's the only downside I'll give it another go and try the pizza when I return.",

It's actually rather impressive the large amount of options vegan folk have when ordering a pizza there.  They also have a great beer selection, in fact I am a member for their \"beer club\", where you can get prizes for drinking beer. The price for their beer is also very reasonable.   I'm 90% sure all of their crusts are gluten free as well, which is a plus but doesn't matter to me as much as just having yummy vegan goodness.  The only reason I'm not giving the MM 5 stars is it's quality fluctuates a lot. Some days I'll go in and it's great service and food quality, other days I go in and It's ok (never a bad experience yet).  I do recommend the garlic bread, just let them know to make it vegan if that be your preference.",

    "text": "In the land of Charlotte pizza, Mellow Mushroom falls squarely in the good, A-OK category for me. I've been to many a Mellow Mushroom - Atlanta, Charleston, Raleigh etc. and while this location didn't disappoint me, it didn't thrill me either.   The Good:  1) The decor is hippie kitschy with a really cool school bus in the middle of the restaurant. I want to eat in a school bus.  2) The bar is pretty spacious and they have trivia on Monday evenings. 3) Beer specials *can* be good, all depends on the night you go.   The Fine: 1) I've had a variety of pies from Mellow Mushroom and I've enjoyed the White Pizza and the Veggie. 2) Our server was on point with multiple checks and beer orders. However, we did ask for a few things off our pizza that were left on, though.   The Not So Great:  1) The wait can be astronomical - and it's not *just* because it's a new location. Folks flock to Mellow Mushroom. In droves. 2) That being said, there can be tons of kiddos in the restaurant. Now, I don't have any problems with little ones - they have to eat too. The environment can be bit too conducive for the wee ones to run amock and into tables. Not so great.  3) It's a bit pricey for what you get. Since I don't love love love the pizza, paying $20 for a 14\" pie leans on the higher pie price point.  Will I go back? Sure...if I can have a low key evening at the bar with minimal wait!",

    "text": "I had to go back a second time before writing this review to be sure that I was right. Maybe there was some extraneous factor to my first visit here that colored my perception? Was I just really hungry, or was I caught up in the hype? So it's been a few weeks since then and I went again late on a Saturday. And, well, you can see the stars. My brain didn't trick me the first time around.  Mellow Mushroom makes every other pizza place look plain and mundane in my eyes. Walking in the door is already a huge sensory rush - it's bright, colorful, the decorations are warm and cartoony, the music is rockin' and my GOD does it smell good. Instantly my expectations were met with the atmosphere.  Step one: ordering. The menu's big and the beer list is diverse. Everything from $9 pitchers of Magic Hat #9 to $20 pitchers of Young's Double Chocolate. Order a pitcher (it comes with incredibly sturdy glassware) so you can dig into the menu. I've stuck to the pizzas and calzones as it's hard to break such a delicious habit. I have heard the sandwiches and salads rock too, so if that's your boat you won't be hung out to dry.   Side note: if you want an appetizer, you must MUST get that cheesy garlic bread. Holy crap, it was like eating the food equivalent of gold.  But what really brings me here is the pizza, and it has yet to disappoint. The crust is crisp and has a bit of sweetness; it's thin in the middle and thick at the edge -  like getting a free breadstick with every slice. I repeatedly order the House Special, a supreme pile o' flavor starring pepperoni, ham, sausage, bacon, olives, onion, green pepper, mushrooms, and fresh-sliced Roma tomatoes. Every piece of my pizza was bursting with fresh flavor and I could taste most every ingredient. Danielle has had the Philosopher's Pie and the Buffalo Chicken on our two visits and I've tasted both with impressive results. The Buffalo Chicken was especially impressive and had a great spicy flavor to compliment the chicken.  The one request I have of you, fair Yelper, is to try something new. I typically avoid mushrooms and olives, but they rocked my world on this pie. Don't just get a pepperoni and cheese because you will miss out on what the Mushroom has to offer!",

I've tried other (3) Mellow Mushrooms in other states, like Atlanta, GA.  Now the BEER. Great selection. FIVE STARS for having plenty of things on draft.

Not on the menu but if you ask nice they will still do one for you.   ============  2012 review:  A great spot that has kept us coming back on a regular basis. With only a couple of exceptions, service is typically very good.  If you visit at peak times (seems to be Friday - Sunday) from dinner time through 8 or 9 -- expect a wait to get a seat and longer times for food to come out...but they are typically good about getting appetizers out in a reasonable time so pick one and enjoy.   A cool feature about this place is the school bus... a big yellow bus cut open with booths inside. Kids love it and they are free to graffiti the insides.  If you are looking for a more tame, kid-free zone you will want to stay away from the bus.  The outside patio is a perfect spot when weather is nice and they put out heat in the colder months.   The food is awesome. My personal favorite standbys are either the Kosmic Karma pizza or the Jerk Chicken Hoagie on pita. Unique (wheat?) dough and some funky pizza creations are what they are known best for  I've liked everything I've tried including other pizzas, calzones, and sandwiches.  Beer selection is also top notch. Look at the board near the entrance for any daily drink specials, and check out their beer blends for some interesting mixes of two beers.  If you can't decide from among the long list of craft beers, go for the sampler and pick 4 highball samples to try.   Overall the food, service, and atmosphere keep us coming back. Well worth a visit if you have not been before.",

    "text": "When you talk about pizza you have to talk about 2 categories: down & dirty pizzaria style and fancy pants pizza restaurant style. Mellow Mushroom takes a swing at the latter category and knocks it completely out of the park.  We were here on a Saturday for lunch and had no trouble getting seated (although we might haveif we wanted to wait for the patio). We immediately perused the impressive  beer list and settled on a pitcher of Highland Gaelic. The bf ordered some garlic cheese bread while we decided on pizzas and for this I am indebted to him. So cheesy, so garlic-y, so delicious (esp. once we added red pepper flake that was sitting on the table). You must eat it, okay?  I went with the Philosopher's Pie (steak, portabellos, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, provolone, feta & mozzarella on oil & garlic sauce). The mushroom slices were large and firm and the brine from the hearts and olives was in no way overwhelming. At one point while eating my eyes may have rolled back in my head in delight, just maybe. He went with the house special sans olives (pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, onions, green peppers mushrooms, roma tomatoes, ham, bacon and extra cheese). As far as supreme pizza combos go this is apparently as supreme as they get.  We left feeling OH SO fat & sassy and with half of each pie in a box, so head somewhere else if you are just a bit peckish...unless you want to eat leftovers for the next 2 days. I'd just like to throw in here at the end that there was a bit of a discrepancy in the sturdiness of their supplies. I swooned over the heavy pizza servers and thick glass pitchers but those had to have been the saddest metal forks I have ever seen. Oh well, had the fork failed me I would have Jersey folded that baby up because I wasnt missing out on a bite.",

The salad was typical salad, the meatballs were typical meatballs...and the pizza, well, it's good, but not the kind of pizza I like to go out for.   We had the mighty meaty and house special pizza, and it was LOADED with toppings and cheese.  This is one dense, doughy pizza.  If that's you're thing, then go for it.   If you're like me and like a thin, crusty chewy Neapolitan style pie, this ain't gonna cut it.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the fact that they don't take reservations..we had a large group of fourteen people and we did end up waiting almost an hour and 1/2 for a table. Luckily this place has a great selection of beer and a nice bar area. What really made up for our long wait and a bunch of cranky hungry adults was our waiter Tom I honestly don't think I have had this good of service in years.   Tom put in our appetizers right away made sure we all had drinks split our checks a million different ways and trusted us with the gratuity. Even though seating is first come first serve they have really large tables that can seat at least 14 people together and its a great place for large groups.   Now for the food. I've eat-in at other Mellow Mushrooms and the food has always been pretty good - I don't know if I was starving our what but my pizza was awesome. I had the red skin potato pizza it tasted like potato skins on bread it was amazing and I could only it one piece it was huge. OR maybe it was the pretzel appetizer that I was full from. All in all check this place out you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Do you have the munchies for an undisclosed reason?  Like your pizza joint with pyschadelia memorabilia and menu items that evoke memories of So-Cal, circa 1970?  Wanna eat in the magic bus?  Well, I think Mellow Mushroom might do the trick.  Despite the overly-thematic interior, I thin the latest reincarnation of Mellow Mushroom has alot of potential.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised at how family-friendly this place is (lot of little people-thanks, Sam P.).  We waited a long while for the food to arrive, but when it did-holy mackerel!!!  I ordered calzone that covered a platter plate and served with marinara sauce.  It's been a long time since I've had a good calzone and this one really hit the spot.  Real steak (not the frozen meat strips like at the grocery store), ricotta and mozzarella cheese, onions, and bell peppers.  Dios mio, I'm in love!  I ended up taking about half of it home, for which it made a gluttonous lunch the next day.  Our server was friendly, he answered several questions about the menu and made suggestions.  What was I expecting anyway...an aloof  stoner?  However, he could have been more attentive with refills and \"how is everthing?\"s, ya know. I hear they have trivia, so I will be back so the world can see how much useless knowledge I posses.",

The reason I have been going here religiously for the past month is TUESDAY NIGHT TRIVIA. Plus you know, My Man loves the Beer.  Pizza is solid like I said and either veg or meaty it is solid, nuff said. Beer here is pretty vast. Man has tried a couple then found a Blue Point Toasted and that has been his mainstay. I'm usually so dehydrated from being at the farmer's market that I'll throw back waters all night.  Service is on point. The bartender-dude is a pretty rad guy. Always takes good care. SO ANYWHOOOO this TRIVIA night is pretty fun. Lately they have been doing like decade themes and those are fun. The cool part is the round prize is a pint-o-beer or $10 gift card. Yup being smart and knowing useless things can actually pay off who knew? The music is lively and the hosts: Evelyn Rose are pretty cool. Yall should come and enjoy this awesome shin-dig Tue nights!",

Sure we were mad at first that there was no room to eat on the school bus, but i'm over it.   We ordered the buffalo pizza and liked it a lot. i mean $20 for a medium pizza seems a little high on my pizza price scale, but that's the way it goes for a delicious pizza in a fun environment.    They appeared to have some wickedly huge booths that could probably seat more people than i know at one table which seemed kind of cool.     i was pleasantly surprised at a reasonably priced delicious beer on special for $3 draft on a Friday night. Also, outdoor patio will be nice to enjoy the weather and for those who prefer not to stare at the 1000 mushroom tips decorating the inside.",

We went on a Friday night, 11pm and they weren't offering their main menu, instead a late night menu, which is as follows:  Slices - $1.50 + 25 cents per topping (all toppings available) Wings - $0.50 each Bruschetta -  $3 Spinach Artichoke Dip - $3 Hummus - $3  We started off w/ the bruschetta and my taste buds were high fiving each other it was so good! Crumbled feta on top, there were six 2 inch rounds on the plate and all were fresh and delish (did I mention only $3?!).  I tried the buffalo chicken pizza w/ pineapple and the jerk tofu w/ jalapenos and both were A++. My date got steak and onions and BBQ chicken, and the steak was so great he ordered a slice to go for lunch the next day! Pizza was just great and I'm excited to try more combinations.  Our server was Tom and he was great - attentive but not overbearing. I had a specialty beer drink called The Lava Lamp - Guinness, Stella and some Framboise - YUM! Only $5.50 too :)  Only beef I have with this place is the lighting is HARSH. We sat in a booth under a bunch of street lamps they have set up as decor inside - we were the only people there and it was just TOO bright. Uncomfortably bright. Don't know if they can dim the lights as the evening goes on, but it was enough to agree to always sit at the bar away from those lamps!",

    "text": "I've been here before and the food is great but the service was ok (not bad but not great).  This rating is based on an attempt to order a pizza.  I work at a near-by University and tried to order a pizza for pick-up.  We were ordering pizza for an event on campus.  Our in-house dining services is preparing our pizzas but we needed a vegan and gluten-free pizza option.  So that removed the normal pizza places including our campus dining services.  Last year we used Mellow Mushroom.  I was hoping to place the order for pick-up later in the day and pay for it over the phone (which your standard delivery places do).  First, the person who answered the phone definitely made it sound like I was being a big burden with the request for pick-up later in the day.  Then, when I asked if I could pay for it (so a student could pick-up the pizza) I was told they needed to get the manager.  When the manager took the phone they stated that due to an incident last week where someone committed identity theft they could not help me.  The individual didn't ask any questions or try to understand what I was hoping to do or where I was.  I understand how people may try to scam a system and I'm sure pizza places get a fair share of scam calls.  It would be really easy though to confirm who I was and that the order was legit.  Apparently, one incident is enough for them to change their policy on phone orders.  It's up to them, they must have done the math that the business from these orders isn't worth it.  Their customer service could definitely use some work.  I told them I would take my business elsewhere.  I easily found another pizza restaurant nearby that would work with us.",

BTW, have you tried the calzones?? They're bigger than ME! ..Possibly not, but they're pretty huge. My favorite is the House Calzone with spinach, mushrooms, roma tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. I like everything I've tried except for the wings. It was an appetizer that my friend ordered.. but who comes to Mellow Mushroom for wings anyways??",

I have a low tolerance for bad pizza, having grown up in the Midwest within a stone's throw of Papa Del's, and I had forgotten how good the Mellow Mushroom actually is. It comes down to the sauce and the creative combinations of flavors. The gluten free crust holds up to being held in your hand and has a good texture. I ordered the Kosmic Karma. It's big enough for two and the toppings are fabulous.",

    "text": "Went here based on the reviews on the Social Media outlets like Yelp. Boy, were WE in for a shock when we went to the Myer's Park location on Selwyn. For some strange reason, we were expecting an \"adult\" upscale pizza place. But when we got there, it was laden with TONS of children and we both were reminded immediately of Chucky Cheeses (in atmosphere, not food). And do NOT get me wrong! Families and children are sacred and they have to eat also, but it's just we were NOT expecting this when we walked in.....  We thought about running out, but decided what the heck, we're here, let's try the food. So we did. At least they have a good beer selection, and many on draft. Yeah! I needed it to quell the seemingly thousands of screaming kidlets running amok.   So we ordered 2 different pizzas as is our custom as my wife and I like different things on our pizza. So after eating them, we were both \"underwhelmed\" for what we got for what we paid for. The pizzas were good, but nothing great considering the money we paid. Total bill was almost $60 for 2 pizzas, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers. Pretty steep for pie, wouldn't you say?  Overall, they do have a good product and nice beers. But, when you can drive a few blocks away to Portofino's and have AWESOME (NY-style thin) pizza for less, then why come here? And at Portofino's, chances are you'll have a much more intimate time than you will at Mellow Mushroom.",

I used to frequent the one in Quail Hollow because the pizza was outstanding and the beer selection was top notch.    The problem with this one is, that it's just not as good.  The pizza recipe has changed, I don't care what they say, it's different.  The sauce is sweeter, the crust not as delicious, and for the love of god, please turn the oven down.  Every pizza I've gotten here, and I've given it a good 4 or 5 tries, has an overcooked crust that's obviously the result of a pizza oven being too hot.  The service is exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant that has a hippy bus inside it and is named Mellow Mushroom, not good.  You might be able score some reefer here though, not sure if that's an ingredient you can put on your pizza or not...  \"Can I get the Maui Wowie with extra Wowie on my 'za.... brah?\"  The only reason I'm cool with 2 stars is that the decor is sweet and they have those Dyson air-blade hand dryers in the bathroom - how cool are those!?!

    "text": "Mellow Mushroom isn't exactly the sort of place I'd ordinarily go. Woodstock murals, giant hippy-painted school-buses in the middle of the dining, and awkward wrap-around booths just don't quite appeal to my more refined dining sensibilities. But, my coworkers dig it. And the one on Selwyn has a reputation for slow, inattentive service - which is perfect when you and your coworkers are looking to extend your one-hour workday lunch break into a 2.5 hour marathon.  During the carpool-carride over, the majority of us joked about how terrible the service would be. Shauna, our lone female (and lone optimist), righteously defended MM's honor. \"You guys are so harsh,\" she groaned. \"We got bad service one time... and now it's like they're the worst place ever.\"  We were quick to point out to Shauna multiple specific examples of the bad service we had received on several separate occasions:  \"Remember the time Mark had to go behind the bar and pour his own beer because the waiter never came back?\"  \"Remember the time we were seated for 47 minutes before anyone took our drink order?\"  \"Remember the time we had three different (lousy) waiters because none of them knew whose section we were in?\"  Nevertheless, we keep coming back, hopeful each time that the experience will change. It never does.  Last Friday we were welcomed and seated promptly. Out waitress approached, comely and upright, with jet-black hair, loose but not sloppy clothing, and a lovely porcelain-skinned face - plain and inexpressive... but not entirely lifeless. She introduced herself with a breathless murmur: Kim, Amy, Amber... I dunno. I don't think she even knew.  \"Hi,\" we all said with genuine enthusiasm. She just sorta stood there and teetered like a weeble. \"We need drinks,\" I declared. \"Any specials?\"  \"Um...\" Kim/Amy looked bewildered.  Bart leaned forward and read off the specials on the chalkboard behind her. The last one was a \"Mystery Beer: $3\" \"What's the 'mystery beer'?\" I asked.  Kim/Amy shrugged. \"It's a mystery.\"  I was intrigued. So I ordered one. (Turns out the mystery beer is just a random bottle of a crappy beer like Grolsch or Longboard or something else they're trying to get rid of that shouldn't be sold for more than a buck...)  Bart cleared his throat. \"Is there a lunch special?\" he asked, catching Kim/Amy completely off-guard.   \"What day is it?\" she asked us, sincerely.  \"Um... Friday.\"  \"Oh, then yeah. We have the special.\"  We all, then, politely extended a protracted pause. When no further information was offered, we were compelled to pry: \"Oh yeah? So... what is the special?\"  \"It's a slice and a salad,\" Kim/Amy replied, quite matter-of-factly.  \"What kind of slices can I choose from?\" Bart asked.  \"You can get anything you want,\" She said.  \"Oh!\" Bart's face lit up as he started scanning through the specialty pies in the menu's center page. \"So, I can get the Mighty Meaty?\"  As if he should have known, Amy/Kim halted him sternly, \"No, you can't get those. You have to make your own.\"  Bart, a bit flummoxed, tried to reason this out. \"Oh, so I can't choose a specialty pizza but I can get whatever toppings I want?\"  Kim/Amy nodded. \"Yeah, you can get whatever you want. I mean, you have to pay for toppings.\"  Bart, now more flabbergasted than flummoxed, persisted. \"Ok, so... toppings are extra?\"  \"I mean... you get one,\" she said.  Now the picture was forming more clearly. An audible \"ahhh!\" of clarity was released by half the table. \"So, it's a one-topping slice and a salad?\"  Kim/Amy nodded. Now we were getting somewhere. But then, as if she were somehow made uncomfortable by the sudden moment of clarity, she decided to throw us an additional curveball. \"Or you can get two slices.\"  Bart, now just being a jack-ass, forced her hand. \"Oh, so instead of toppings I can just get two slices - but does cheese count as a topping?\"   \"No, a slice and a salad.\"  We all laughed. And she laughed too. Not sure if she knew it was an at-you-not-with-you type thing.  Orders were placed. Most of us got the special, some got sandwiches. I ordered pretzels for the table (garlic bread in the shape of a pretzel with marinara for dipping).  The side-salads came out promptly. Unspectacular - just some greens with onion and tomato sprinkled in. Then, we waited. Took about half an hour for the food to arrive (the appetizer brought at the same time as the entrees... sigh). And we did get one or two more rounds of drinks served in that time. So, all in all, not too bad.  The food is... mediocre. Greasy slices of pizza with run-of-the-mill ingredients. The slices are large, so there's that. The guys who got sandwiches were impressed and noted that \"sandwiches are the way to go here\". Good to know.  Checks were a bit of a situation. We had to each recount what exactly we'd ordered since Kim/Amy evidently didn't split it up as she took things down. No big deal. It's Mellow Mushroom.  1.5 hours in and out. Best experience I've ever had there.",

Our waiter was a lot of fun and the food was absolutely delicious and affordable. I got the portobello sandwich and I wouldn't have changed a thing. I got a bite of my friend's pizza (what they're known for) and that was a little slice of heaven, too.  Also, any restaurant will get 5 stars if the adorable waiter sings to me.",

The pizza was not cooked and the soup smelt absolutely horrible. We left and would not recommend or ever go back.",

    "text": "I'd really like to be able to visit this place more than 2x's a year but it takes about 6 months to get over each bad experience.  The Quick & Dirty: Good atmosphere, good location, good beer selection, excellent pizza, horrible service.  Server inexperience kills this place, last time we dined there the lack of urgency brought out my inner 10% tipper, which is physically painful to do as a former bartender and server I generally average in the 30-50% range, but I cannot enable that crappy of service.  The previous time we probably waited 10 minutes at a bar table before even as little as being greeted, we got up and went to Duckworth's.  See you guys again in September.",

    "text": "Ok, so I love pizza, I eat too much of it and so does my husband but we have both agreed this is the best pizza we have had in Charlotte.  I'd seen this chain around in other places but never tried it out.  The location of the place is great and the atmosphere inside is cool, they have an old bus that's painted you can sit inside and all of the servers are nice and friendly.  There's always a beer special that's decent and pretty cheap too.  On to the pizza, I've been more than once and each time we have gotten the same thing.  Pepperoni and Mushroom pizza, I'm sure all their other flavors are amazing as well but this one was so delicious we just stick with it.  The crust is a little crunchy but still chewy, the cheese is melty and salty and the toppings are great.  I was stuffed and still ate my entire half of the pizza (I think we got the medium sized one?)    Anyway, it's not the cheapest place in town but it's worth it!",
