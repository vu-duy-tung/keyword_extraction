    "text": "We visited Leroy Fox this past Saturday night for the first time.  They don't accept reservations (except for big parties), so we took our chance, hoping that it wouldn't be too long of a wait.  Fortunately, despite the restaurant being packed, there was hardly a wait at all (only a couple of minutes), and there's a BIG waiting comfy area anyway.    Our first impression of the restaurant was the fantastic outdoor seating area.  It's all enclosed so you actually feel like you're not jutting out into the parking lot.  If it wasn't 50 degrees outside (the outdoor heaters still weren't doing the trick), we would have liked to have sat out there.  But then we would have had to contend with the smokers out there, too, and that would not have been fun.  Just passing through, we noticed the smoke tended to linger in that enclosed area.  Bummer.  Maybe summertime outdoor dining might not be an option either.  I really liked the interior of the restaurant, too.  It's casual, but very nice with the rustic wood.    Our second impression of the restaurant was the loudness of the place.  Wow.  We got used to it after awhile, but it definitely was crazy loud.  Sound really carries throughout the whole rectangular-shaped dining room.     Their drinks are very reasonably priced.  It's not often you see beer anymore at those prices without being \"on special.\"  We opted for the fancy hard liquor drinks, though, which ran about $8-10 (also good).  I tried the Pamarita -- tequila, Pama, Cointreau, and sour mix.  They definitely do not skimp on the tequila!  You get your money's worth, and it tasted great, too.    For an app, we shared their \"world famous\" zucchini fries.  They were really big and tasty.  The fried coating on there tasted like KFC's fried chicken coating to me!  It was very peppery, just the way I like it.  I'm usually not a fan of fried chicken on the bone, but if it tastes like the coating on the zucchini fries, I might give it a try.  I saw lots of BIG plates of fried chicken go by our table.  Their portions will satisfy hungry appetites.  For my entree, I opted for the Honey Buffalo chicken sandwich.  It was sweet and spicy with blue cheese crumbles melted on top.  Very good, just like the zucchini fries.  To give my body a break from the fried app and entree, I picked a side salad as my sandwich's side.  It was only a $1 more.  They do have a wide variety of other sides, though, too, so you don't always have to have fries.    Would we go back?  Definitely.   The food was \"foxing fantastic\" (their phrase, not mine), the service was great, and everything was very reasonably priced.  The downsides are that it can be quite loud in the restaurant and if you want to sit outside in their awesome-looking patio, be prepared to inhale second-hand smoke.",

    "text": "What does this fox say?  He says \"There's better food than this in Charlotte\".  The wife and I dropped by this much-hyped Sharon Amity eatery Sunday after church.  While Sunday after church is usually a suicide time slot, the wait was short and the staff very nice.    The dining room was packed and loud but not in an off-putting way.  The lady at the hostess stand, the waitress and even the busboy were all great, offering kind words and big smiles along with the fast service.  On an accessibility note, I will say that my wife is in a wheel chair and everything was very easy for her, no steps, a nice ramp outside and wide doorways.  The biggest turn off, aside from the food, is the limited parking situation.  We had to make a couple of laps before a spot opened up.  The food was not what we were hoping for.  Having read several glowing reviews in the local papers, we were looking forward to a good sit down restaurant that really knows how to make great fried chicken and wonderful home-style sides.  Looks like we'll have to keep looking.  We both had fried chicken, so I can't speak for any other entrees etc.  The chicken was just OK.  It was hot but a little greasy and way too dry.  I expect it was overcooked.  The highly touted brine and seasoning process didn't bring much to the party.  Could have used a little more salt and a little less cayenne pepper.  The corn muffing was OK, but not even warm enough to melt the room temperature honey butter.  The mashed potatoes were OK, the texture was a little loose and not a lot of flavor.  The mac and cheese was a huge disappointment, slightly warmer than room temperature and totally devoid of flavor.  They should have called it just Macaroni because for the life of me I couldn't find and cheese or any flavor.   Maybe the biggest disappointment in what was turning out to be a symphony of inefficacy was the so-called banana pudding.  I've seen it recommended by other reviewers and since, I am a fan of the dish, I gladly shelled out 6 bucks to give it a go.  A huge bowl of very thick flavorless pudding like glop filled the bottom of a large bowl.  there were 3 banana slices stuck into the gloppy mess and on top was a huge pile of flavorless whipped cream with exactly 3 hard vanilla wafers stuck into it.  a fourth vanilla wafer had been crumbled over the top of this disaster.  Absolutely no flavor of anything, much less banana.  Maybe the burgers and some of the other sides are better, but I won't be finding out.",

The old Hotel Charlotte was nicely transformed into a trendy, sports bar/southern comfort type environment.  Well done.  Between the 4 of us we tried quite a few items on the menu.....We tried the fried zucchini sticks which came with a spicy dipping sauce and they were awesome.    We tried the mashed potatoes, cheesy grits, fried chicken, baked beans and chicken salad.  All were phenomenal.    I have to give a special shout out to the lovely waitress, Erica, that offered our table a free dessert.  It was a heath bar blondie....yes, you heard right.  It was smothered with whipped cream, drizzled in caramel and chocolate sauce and it was heated through.  It was divine.  Their whole dessert menu looked scrumptious so I'd go back just for that.  They sell T-shirts as well.  I'm not sure I get the point of that but some of them were pretty cute....especially the ones for females.  However, $24 or $25 for a t-shirt of a local restaurant hardly seems worth it.  Just my opinion.",

    "text": "A month or so ago, I was lucky enough to check out Leroy Fox during their soft opening. And while I've been meaning to head back much sooner, I finally got a chance to check it out again last night! Overall, I'm thinking that Leroy Fox is going to be a neighborhood staple in Cotswold!   Hubs and I rolled in on a Wednesday night, hankering for some fried chicken. What? Don't judge. It sounded delicious. The exterior of Leroy Fox features a really cool looking patio, surrounded by what looks to be a Lincoln Log/Jenga-esque wall. There are plenty of cutouts and openings to ensure plenty of air flow. When the weather turns lovely, this patio will be a hoppin'.  Speaking of hoppin', the restaurant was super busy for a Wednesday night. Considering the number of TV's and comfy booths, it's no surprise. The place itself is warm and modern, yet Southern. There are tons of local influences from Poppy's Bagel chips to the decor to the locally named items.   Because the place was perhaps abnormally busy on a Wednesday night, service was a bit harried overall. However, the food and beverage certainly made up it! Here's what I ordered...  Selwyn Avenue (cocktail): 5/5: Wow. They should just name this happy juice. It's an Arnold Palmer esque (1/2 tea, 1/2 lemonade) but with a twist of Dragonberry rum. And it's yum. I also love that it's served in a mason jar!   1/4 North Fried Chicken: 4.5/5: Super delicious, crispy fried chicken. This plate is served with a wing and a breast and both pieces were very flavorful and juicy. The breading on the bird is salted and peppered and perfect with hot sauce!   Mac 'n cheese: 4/5: This was one of my side items and I was scraping the bottom of the ramekin to get every last bite. It's creamy shells and it's delightful.   Green bean casserole: 3/5: The casserole was just fine, but nothing crazy or overly spectacular. If you love green bean casserole, you'll likely enjoy it.   Cornbread: 3/5: I fully appreciate that I received not one but two cornbread muffins with my meal. Score! This cornbread was solid, but dry. Hubs dunked his in gravy and ate it right up.   Gravy: 4/5: That being said, the gravy was tasty...and I'm not even a gravy lover!   I can absolutely envision myself coming back to Leroy Fox for another helping of that practically perfect fried chicken and Selwyn Avenue cocktail. At an affordable $17 for the two ($9 chicken and $8 cocktail), my belly was full and very happy.",

Our server was fast and friendly, keeping our waters topped off and making sure we were good with drinks and food.

I was slightly disappointed in the size of the mac and cheese side - I was jealous of the child's portion!

There were 2 tables that had words and actually walked out . So after a hour and half we get food , guess what COLD,NASTY,POS.  I had ordered  the Brussel sprouts ad no kidding every one but 8-9 were nothing but leaves. The fries  were stone cold, Mac and cheese was Cold. How can you almost burn fried chicken ,when that is your main menu. We NEVER got a apology from mngr, poor waitress never maid eye contact and said the bill is covered. This place is usually great but when your kitchen/ manager staff screws the dog that bad . I think  my guests and I won't be coming back anytime soon. The real kicker is one of my group is working with the new Apartment communities about good places to eat in the area. I don't think you will be recommended any time soon.",

The Man and I shared the Zucchini Fries, which were perfectly seasoned with cayenne pepper, and generous enough for a whole meal. I ordered the BBQ Peach Salad and my date had the Grilled Chicken sandwich with a fried egg and pimento cheese.

It was delicious and had quinoa in the patty!  Overall food is really good.  Service is good and personable.  The only part I didn't particularly enjoy was when I ordered my mimosa I was only intending to have one, but was charged for the bottomless.

    "text": "To start, solely for the great service, I LOVE the Leroy fox on South blvd but after two visits to this location, I feel I can leave this review. The food, for the cotswold area, is just nothing to write home about and a few dollars over priced on every menu item. 13-17 for a sandwich or burger....this is Charlotte and you can get a way better brunch or lunch for that price. The Friday/Saturday drink is $9 cocktails... wait, what!? Again, this is Charlotte and a HIGH end cocktail is typically $10. That's not a special I'm interested in. The customer service is half and half- some of the people here are clearly trying, but the younger staff members just don't get it. There was a young hostess today and acted super busy and rushed (during a no wait time) and did not even bother to say hello or kindly say she would be right with us while helping others. We were just standing at the empt hostess stand. To me, thats just a super simple customer service tactic. We shouldn't stand around for 5 minutes with no greeting while she is walking right past. I have rated every place in Charlotte I can find with great customer service an easy 5 stars. Busy or not, it's just not difficult to put on a smile and kind voice. She is very young so room for growth on that. Our waiter was a very very polite young man and was trying hard so that's where the three stars comes in. Between every table having 5+ babies and high seats at pretty much every table and no room between them and your own personal space, this restaurant location is just truly not my favorite.",

It took a minute or two for our server to get around to us.  It wasn't crowded.  More at the bar.   Our group had the haddock sand, prohib burger and I got the chicken fried chicken. The sands came with fries or sweet potato tots. Fries are fries. The tots? Very good.  I enjoyed them more than my sister.  Sweet and salty.  More sweet but definitely worth a try.  They split sands and shared.  Haddock got rave reviews the burger not as much.  I has an entree that came with 2 sides.  They were out of my first choice potato cake so I went with mac and cheese and grits.  I'm no veg head and I swear cheese does make everything better but the selection could use some variety.  Mostly starchy choices, green beans and slaw. Anyway, I'm paranoid about ordering grits. I always suspect they were cooked early that morning and kept on life support all day. I went against instinct and won't do that again.  The mac was watery, lacked body or any distinctive cheesy flavor or appeal, noodles were well cooked but sauce disappointed.  The gravy on my chicken was bland and unimpressive.  I scraped it off to get to the highlight. The chicken was flat out good.  I did not share.  1) entree portion was very small 2) not getting much from the accompanying sides.  I did snag a few tots,that helped,  It was moist, tender and well seasoned.  I'm not big on the crunchy crispy outside trend. We didn't have a frydaddy growing up.  We did have cast iron.  Clearly chicken is well respected here and it shows.  I considered dessert, (light supper), but was disappointed at a short list that offered 2 puddings and more super sweet choices.     Service lacked.  The only person that seemed to have any kind of hustle was the young lady that brought out our food.  She also brought out most everyone else s. Servers seemed to clear tables and take orders. I hope they pool tips.   Will I return?  Probably not.  Can't see myself passing by Eddies where service is pretty tight and I feel like I get more bang for my buck and more and better choices. Will I think about that chicken again. Hell Yeah!  Best to them!",

Today I ordered the pimiento egg fried chicken sandwich, and it was incredible. So much flavor. My husband ordered his go-to dish of shrimp and grits, which he claims is the best he's had. The grits have a great consistency and lots of flavor, as well.   Great place for brunch, lunch, or dinner!",

I liked the vibe immediately, Leroy Fox seems to standout among its peers on Sharon Amity. I wasn't expecting such a large space, but when you walk in, you realize, this is BIG. It has plenty of seating, bar space, and TVs. The bar has some great local beers and other fun selections.   The hosts and waiters were all very friendly and efficient.  I have not had a chance to dig too deeply into the menu. I've had a few bits of the chicken wrap, and it was so YUM! The chicken had so much flavor. I had the Grilled Buffalo Chicken Salad- again, lots of flavor and freshness.   I can't wait to go back and dive deeper into the menu!",

    "text": "We were hoping for much more than we received. We went with another couple for brunch. It was everyone's first time eating there. The decor is beautiful, until you realize there are tvs all around you. Rather than being a nice, quiet restaurant, it was more of a sports bar atmosphere. The tvs are a distraction and do not belong is a restaurant this nice.   The waitress came to take our order on a Sunday for brunch, wearing very short shorts. Now, it really seemed like a sports bar. We were expecting a much nicer atmosphere for some reason.   Shortly after we ordered, the waitress came back to tell us that they were out of breakfast casserole, which both my husband and I ordered. We then re-ordered the Which Came First?. Our food was delivered by some random person, who basically plopped it on the table without saying a word. It was very rude!  My friends ordered three entrees, one to share and their own. One of the entrees came out wrong. After telling the waitress that it was the wrong piece of chicken,  she argued telling us that a chicken drumstick was  chicken wing. What kind of waitress argues with the customers knowing it is their first time at the restaurant and secondly, it was a drumstick instead of a wing? Three of us had to say to her that it is not a wing so she would take it back and get a wing. So ridiculous!    It was NOT surprising when she argued, because she kept forgetting everything we asked for. I ordered lemon with my water, and then had to as two more times before getting it. I also ordered a mimosa, only $3, and I think she forgot that for a while too. We asked for sauce when we realized the food was dry, and had to ask at least one more time before getting it.  Oh, and the mimosa was mostly champagne, but that isn't really a compliant, just a comment.  Our experience was not good to say the least. The only good thing was that another waitress or manager, not sure because she never said, came to our table to fill the water glasses and asked how everything was. So, she got an ear full. She eventually came back and gave us our checks that were 50% off. Honestly, that is the only thing that was good about our experience. We appreciated her effort very much. All in all, I believe the waitress caused our entire meal to go downhill.  We will give it one more try for dinner, just because the chicken on the Which came first was actually good.",

First of all, the outdoor appearance of this place is gorgeous (but frankly it SCREAMS infill, it's nothing like the rest of the shops in that strip mall. Thank goodness that it's located on the end and not in the middle). There's a ton of faded gray-ish wood surrounding an amazing patio with tons of tables and TVs to check out whatever game is on. The inside is nice and open, we were sat quickly. They have a pretty good beer list - The Lady and I both started with a beer. I had been craving wings for a while, so I ordered their wings (6 for $8) with honey buffalo sauce which was fantastic. Add a side of cajun fries, and you have a great meal right there. The Lady ordered the BBQ Chicken Chopped Peach salad and it was gone before I even had the chance to ask her how it was. So...I would say that she enjoyed it.  Put all this together in a family friendly atmosphere that's definitely wallet friendly as well, and you have a stellar weeknight dinner location! I will be back!",

We were seated immediately and given menus to look over.  I already knew I wanted to try their burger and my date was anxious to give the chicken a shot.  I ordered a Prohibited burger. I absolutely loved the bacon marmalade...a great way to enjoy the flavor of bacon without having to gnaw on too crispy or too big pieces of bacon that can plague other bacon cheeseburgers.  I wish there was more cheese on my burger, but I'm a cheesehead so perhaps I'm bias and someone else would not mind. Whenever I stop in again I'll ask for double the cheese!  My date (daughter) was a bit underwhelmed with her chicken, she found it a bit bland. She is young, so she doesn't have the most developed taste yet- I will say she absolutely loves meat, I've rarely ever heard her complain about fried chicken.  We both gobbled up the macaroni and cheese and would have rather gotten more of that than fries.  I will certainly return to Leroy Fox, most likely when it is warmer so I can sit in the patio area. More cheeseburgers and mac please!",

The Cajun wings are awesome and perfectly seasoned. I want to like the fried chicken-- I really do but every time I go it's bland despite having a special blend of spices and over cooked. It seems like the recipe tries really hard to be authentic southern fried chicken but just misses the mark. For the atmosphere and because there are  some quality items on the menu I'd still give Leroy Fox a try.",

My response in my head was yeah it's Friday if you weren't busy I probably would not be here. The problem wasn't only that the food was behind but we didn't feel wanted by all staff as the LGBTQ and Black communities. All money is green and spends the same as like it.

Leroy Fox's green tomatoes - not the fried ones - are an item over which someone just admitted to fantasizing. Not me, though.  Sarah is a nice server. Brandon is a charismatic manager. Cailin is Top Eight, and they also have a private room called the Fox Den that can have up to 18 or 20 people, perhaps uncomfortably.  The Shrimp Cobb salad is notable and I recommend the recommended dressing on the side.   Their chicken sandwiches can be grilled or fried, and both methods are pleasing.",

    "text": "Strikes two and three, sorry Leroy Fox, but you are out - forever.  The 3 steps to a successful business model that every business should follow if they want to slither down the spiraling drain of restaurant mediocrity like Leroy Fox:  1. Take group order (4:00pm). So far, so good, nothing too crazy yet.    2. Notify customer that their group order has been canceled (4:45pm) without justification other than \"we are just too busy.\" But it's a Tuesday...and you were not too busy at 4pm to take my order, so what changed?  3. Loss of sales revenue $200-$250 from tonight's order, and into perpetuity.  Every night during quarter-end, our team (approximately 15 people) orders in dinner and we rotate the restaurant selection. Tonight's selection of Leroy Fox was from our newest team member (let's call him \"Drew\") and he was pumped about the selection since he is new to the Charlotte area and has never been. Not only will we never be ordering from Leroy Fox again as a team, ever, but this dinner decision made by the new guy \"Drew\" will be forever reflected poorly in his permanent performance record.  The question I ask myself after this is - I wonder if Leroy Fox management would agree with this decision to not compete the order?  What about strike one someone asked? Aren't there usually 3 strikes in baseball? See Evan T's Leroy Fox review from March 28, 2016. I guess he was wrong about only using Leroy Fox as a carry out restaurant.  All names, except Leroy Fox, have been changed to protect the innocent.",

There are TVs on all the walls that give a sports bar vibe which I didn't mind since the SF vs KC World Series was on!   Unfortunately most of the deep fried appetizers tasted like typical sports bar food although the fried pretzels with 3 dippings were pretty good.   I wasn't sure how big the fried chicken pieces would be so i ordered a \"Northern\" which includes a leg, thigh and breast. What I got was a tiny wing and a small back. Hardly any meat. The chicken was ok but I was disappointed in the meal and the waitress said I must've got someone else's order. I guess I should've said something when I got the dish but couldn't tell if it was a back or breast until I started it. Plus another person in our party received the same non-Northern.  The crispiness of chicken was good but overall I wasn't impressed with the size of the pieces. Does that 2\" wing qualify as a \"piece\"?  I liked the beer selection though as they had a few local brews and they had NoDa Jam Session pale ale which was yum!",

    "text": "I was craving fried chicken, but it's not something I normally eat so after living in Charlotte for three years I had no clue where to go. I've heard of Prices and South 21 from others, but neither are open on Sunday's so I turned to trusty Google and found 'The 15 Best Places for a Fried Chicken in Charlotte' on Foursquare. Leroy Fox was listed as number 4 and since it was closest to my location I decided to give them a try.   We called and ordered one winner winner chicken dinner with mac & cheese and sweet potato tots - and were asked if we wanted sweet or regular tea. The menu doesn't state this selection includes a gallon of tea so the was an awesome addition to our meal. Got it all home and five of us loaded up plates and stuffed our faces in silence. Needless to say, the chicken (and everything else) was fantastic!!! Sweet potatoes tots were served with awesome (would imagine made in-house) honey mustard that we pretty much dipped everything in and couldn't get enough of. Aside from the four cornbread muffins there was about 1.5 servings when we were done.   I look forward to going back and dinning in here. The atmosphere seemed great and I saw many amazing dishes on their menu I plan on trying.",

    "text": "Paul\"s Y Rating: 3.5 Stars Rounded up to 4  Came in because I had such a great time at a Yelp Elite Event earlier this year, and I was in the area, and said, WHY NOT?   I am glad I did. I have not tried their \"world famous\" fried chicken so this was on my agenda. (Side note: just what the F#%+@$&k does \"world famous\" really mean? Like they know about this place in Zimbabwe? Just ssyin.....Hummmmmm)  Sorry for my digression.....back to the review. Could have gone straight bare fried chicken boob plate.....BUT I asked my (really cute by the way) waitress Kayla about their fried chicken sandwiches and she said that HER preference was the Piemento and Egg fried chicken sandwich. So I said let's do it!   Uhhh, ahem, No, I didn't mean \"do it\" (with the really cute waitress)......Crap maybe I did in a Freudian way.....Uggggg. Bad impure thoughts. Bad Paul Bad Paul! Lol....  More digression....feelin frisky today.....Duh.......Back to the fricken chicken!  So this sandwich comes out with supposed \"Cajun\" Fries and looks and smells incredible! See my pic.  So......  The Good - The chicken! To me its better than Price's. Half the bacon was very crispy the other half probably lost that edge under the hot bun. It's ok. The egg! Excellent addition to this sandwich!  The Ok How I Wish It Was better - The bun, described as Brioche. Hum.....this was NOT a Brioche bun. Sorry. It didn't have that requisite butteriness that a True BRIOCHE bun has. IF this sandwich had the real Brioche bun this could be a Top 10 in Charlotte sandwich.   The Meh - The fries. Very AVERAGE! Guys at Leroy Fox you descibe them as CAJUN FRIES. There wasn't one molecule of any Cajun Seasoning on these relatively limp fries! Come on how hard is it to put a simple dusting of Zatarans or other CAJUN spice on the fries? And you need to CRISP THEM UP!  The Ambience was good, felt more like a Sports Bar than classic restaurant with all the TVs on the sport channels. And the aforementioned waitress.....ah to be about 25 years younger......  Overall I can see why the close-by locals really love this place. Sure I'll be back",

The downside it the concept of take out doesn't seem to be friendly enough, you have to fight your way through the bar crowd to the back of the place and hope to get someone's attention to find your food.  Wish they could put it up front and let the hostess finish the transaction or something.",

I ordered the grilled chicken entree.  It was ok, nothing like my husbands fried buffalo chicken sandwich.  I should have gone that route.

Absolutely! The chicken tender app was lightly breaded and served with delicious homemade ranch and honey mustard dressings. My wife had a chicken salad which was large portioned and came with plenty of chicken and of course she requested the homemade ranch dressing again! I had a mimosa (pretty much everyone in the restaurant had one) and the shrimp po'boy with fries. The shrimp was decent sized, cooked to perfection, and came with a delicious sauce that at first didn't look like there was enough of but ended up being plenty once I began to eat it. The restaurant itself is clean, has excellent decor and atmosphere, prompt service, and is great for families, brunch dates, or singles/couples. Leroy Fox is a prime example of what makes a small, locally owned restaurant successful.",

If this is this restaurant's process, Leroy Fox (via Open Table) should not have allowed guests to book reservations near their desired meal time. Now we had to wait an EXTRA 20-30 minutes to be sat.

It was a slow day (granted it was a Monday), but there were some other patrons in the dining room.  Service was great - not over attentive, but there with a refill whenever needed.  I love love love the feel of the restaurant and the decor was perfect.  The food was average.  We had an order of the fried zucchini and it came out thick and hot, with a  plentiful three sauces.  The house specialty Boom Boom sauce was spicy and tangy and delicious.  The second was the staple, Ranch, always a favorite and the third was a spicy remoulade that kicked your mouth into high gear.    I was so excited about the Boom Boom sauce, I ordered the Sweet Carolina Dip with a side of mac and cheese.  The mac & cheese was beautiful, but lacked in flavor.  Maybe if there was some Boom Boom sauce on it . . .  The sandwich was good, large and fun to dip, except my chicken pieces kept falling into the chicken au jus and I didn't really taste any Boom Boom sauce.  A friend got the Shrimp Cobb Wrap.  I was told the shrimp were bland, but I didn't have the option to taste.    I'd love to go back for cocktails and to enjoy the atmosphere.  They have great nightly specials.  I'd also like to try their brunch!  (Sat & Sun, but probably moving to only Sun).",

If you've been there, you know how awful and bland the pasta is. This mac and cheese uses the same exact pasta as CiCis pizza. And the \"cheese\" is white flour paste. Flavorless and blah. The chicken sandwich was hot, which is a plus, but equally as bland.  For 15 bucks I'd expect just a little more. Flavor and effort.  Wife got the Cajun fries which were just OK.  If you're looking for a decent watering hole, its a good option. I'm a food lover though.  So for me, it's two stars only. If it were a bar only, it would be a decent 4 star option.",

For just $12 I got a WHOPPING burger cooked to perfection and loaded up with all the fixin's. Now I've had quite a few Pimento Cheeseburgers in my life, (having attended school in the South) but I can honestly say this was one of the best I've had in a very, very long time. Deciding to go real light and healthy, I also ordered the Mac and Cheese as my side. This too, was also delicious and had I not been there with about 8 of my coworkers I probably would have licked the bowl dry...seriously, you NEED to try the Mac and Cheese.

This is typically a \"go to\" standard for us, however, it's worth my time to leave this review as the service tonight was just horrible. I cannot tell whether the trouble was in the kitchen, with our waitress, or even with sub-par management tonight. Whatever the reason, we'll think twice about dining again.  We brought some out of town friends here, and left a bit embarrassed about how long and frustrating our experience was. I could understand if the restaurant was overwhelmed or seemed understaffed, but the dining room was (at best) 2/3 full and there seemed to be plenty of staff roaming the floor. Here's a fair description of our dinner:  - Drinks were never refilled (and I would have purchased another cocktail) - Our food took at least 40 minutes to arrive to our table - Our waitress never stopped back by the table to check on us (hence the empty water and tea glasses), until she brought the bill. - I noticed several staff hanging out in a private dining room near the front of the restaurant as we left. Maybe the reason we never saw our waitress. - One of our guests' order came out wrong, but because our waitress was nowhere to be found, we couldn't ask to let them know.  I assure you that we're not fussy customers and we rarely leave this aggravated. However, tonight's experience is worth the review. I hope management is reading and taking note.",

    "text": "I have to admit I was quite disappointed in my expect today! I arrived with two friends around 11:20am for brunch. We were greeted by the hostess and sat at a half booth table which was WAY to close to the two tables next to us. Basically like a family style table because the strangers next to us were so close we could hardly carry out own conversation on. Also it's extremely uncomfortable to have to stick your butt in someone face to have to sit down!!!   Once we sat down we literally read the whole menu, picked what we wanted to eat and had a decently long conversation before we started to wonder where our server was because we hadn't been greeted. We started to look around and saw around 5 servers standing in a corner, \"waiting for the rush\". Still no one greeting our table. We saw several people walk by and finally a young lady with brown hair came up to our table. Same girl I saw walk by our table 2 or 3 times without even a \"I'll be right with you.\" It wasn't busy in the restaurant yet either. We ordered waters and told her we would order cocktails at noon (NC laws don't allow alcohol on Sunday's until 12). We ordered an app and our entrees.   Again we found ourselves looking around wondering where our appetizer was when we noticed a table next to us had been sat down after us and had an appetizer already. After what felt like forever we received the one good thing from our experience, Fried Green Tomatoes! These tomatoes have pimento cheese under them and were absolutely delicious which is why I am giving this experience 2 stars.   Then we wait for our entrees which arrived with on egg missing on one of my friends plates and after about half way through our entree we noticed that we didn't have the chicken part of our Chicken & Sausage. I'm not sure if the waitress rang it in wrong or if the kitchen messed it up but it was a price difference and a manager didn't even stop by our table to address it.   My mimosa was ALL orange juice and my friends Bloody Mary had no flavor at all, basically just pure tomato juice!   We noticed that our waitress seemed to have a private room and a full section which did make us a little bit more understanding but to me that says poor management because no server should be sat an amount of tables that they can't handle.   The ladies I was with were talking about our bad experience and we hear the table next to us, which are basically sitting in our laps, say they have waited over an hour for their food. We heard that the Mitch lost their ticket and the manager did go to their table but it really seemed like they didn't have their stuff together!   They need to clean up their systems of service before I will return and work on excelling in True customer service!!",

If this stays consistent I will remove what I posted about the chicken inconsistency's  Right now this is one of my favorite places for good food with a home cooked taste, nothing fancy...just good home style cooked food.  And that's what I prefer most of the time:)",

    "text": "Did a ladies night here with my sister and a friend last night. The place was jam packed which I loved. The energy was great-- lots of people,  good music (which I feel only the crew I came with appreciated). Anyway while we waited for a table we ordered drinks at the bar.  One of the Male bartenders pretended to not see us and got irritated that we were standing where the servers were picking up drinks.  We didn't do it on purpose.  There was literally just no place to stand.  Anyway once we moved the female bartender took our order and made our drinks-- super fast.  I had a  blueberry drink which I can't remember the name of but it was AMAZING!!!!! BEST COCKTAIL I've had in a long time.  My friend and sisters got the cucumber basil cocktail and they all loved it! To eat I had the shrimp wrap.  It was good.  The sweet potato tater tots I got as side were THE BOMB!!! OMG. Piping hot and so good!! Our server was super sweet. Blonde slim girl who was fast, efficient,  and just super nice.  My rating of 3 is because the bar staff was rude and towards the end of our meal a man who I believe was the manager came over and just stood in front of our table staring at us for a minute.... and then said  \"are you guys ok?\" It was so strange.  My sister told me earlier he was behind the bar and super rude to her and my other sister.  Not sure what that was all about.   All in all it was a good time.  The wait was about 30 min which I didn't think was bad.  I'd go back and probably sit at the bar and order drinks and apps next time.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Leroy Fox in the Cotswold neighborhood of Charlotte. Cotswold is named after Cotswold Village Shops, a large shopping center at the intersection of Randolph and Sharon Amity Roads. This southern style neighborhood restaurant specializes in golden fried chicken but serves a full line of southern favorites.  Dora here. What an inconspicuous exterior. Wait until you see what's on the other side of that wall. I confess when hubby preferred to sit inside, I copped a wee attitude. How could we pass up this gorgeous patio? But, then, it was 95 degrees outside, so maybe he had a point...just don't tell him, okay? lol. Instead, we ate inside where it was cool, jammed and loud.  For our appetizer, we chose the Hot Pretzels, bite size nuggets served with Leroy's honey mustard and ranch dipping sauces. The pretzels were great, especially when dipped in the honey mustard sauce. We ate every last one.  Dora here. Well, I did, anyway. Ernie exercised a bit more restraint. lol. Yum, the honey mustard was the big seller, with just a hint of sweet trailing as the pretzel disappeared down the hatch.   For my meal, I chose the 14 North (breast/wing) Leroy's World Famous Foxing Fried Chicken with a side of mac n' cheese. This fried chicken was great, juicy and tender on the inside and crispy skin on the outside. The mac n' cheese was good but not to the level of their chicken.  Dora here. Y'all know that a salad with fruit has my name on it, right? The Berry Almond Chicken Salad won my vote over a couple other entrees by a notch. The chicken was grilled with a nice char, the almonds added texture, and the strawberries popped with color, red and fresh. I would've preferred the poppy seed dressing on the side, but forgot to ask for it that way. The mozzarella clumped with the warm chicken, and while all the elements tasted good individually, I wasn't impressed with the combination.  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 (Ernie 4, Dora 3.5), for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "We went to Leroy Fox back when they opened in 2014 I think? We really liked it, it was delicious food but the service wasn't that great.   We do order from a food delivery service once a week, and when Leroy Fox appeared on their service, we ordered dinner from them back in November of 2014. The food arrived, and it was delicious. Except several items were missing and they ended up crediting us for the missing items.   We tried again on 5/3/15: Once again, great food but missing items that had to be redelivered an hour later.   We still loved the food so we tried again on 11/2/15. Food was great, missing entree.   At this point, we just gave up. It seemed like they were never going to be able to get their act together to actually put together a ticket as ordered (and we aren't complicated orderers or anything either; just basic stuff).   Fast forward to yesterday 6/15/17, we were REALLY craving some Leroy Fox fried chicken, so we thought we'd try one last time.  Good news and bad news. The bad news is that after 3 years, they still can't get an order right. We ordered 1 app and 2 entrees, and they forgot one of the entrees and we had to wait an hour for it to be redelivered.   The good news for us (bad for Leroy Fox) was the food is now really sub-par. Both chicken entrees were massively overcooked and bone dry; the mac and cheese seemed to be no cheese all mac, and the quality of the side dishes was just really not even close to what it was when they opened. That's good news for us because we definitely won't be craving this anymore. Goodbye Leroy Fox - we miss the good food you once provided way back when.",

We went with a couple appetizers to start. The pimento cheese and pita chips were on point. I've been on a pimento cheese kick this week after trying Queen Charlotte's at a Yelp event. Leroy Fox has some good stuff too!! We also tried some of their wings. I like the fact that they through them on the grill before serving them. Adds a nice texture! Of course the beers were cold and refreshing too. My daughter tried one of the signature drink specials too. It tasted like a strawberry milkshake. Not my thing but Kaitlin really liked it. I do wish they had more variety with the appetizer menu but overall a great experience but get here early on the weekends because it gets packed. Need to go back to try the Sunday brunch. I can't say NO to $5 Bloody Marys.",

If you need something tasty along with it, try the zucchini fries.  They're good, too and the dipping sauce is perfect.     And there ends my praise for the Fox.  Sadly, everything else I have tried on the menu has been bland, or just fallen short of my expectations.  I've tried the catfish, the fried steak, the BLT, and several other things.  Everything tastes like they're out of seasoning.  After my last visit, I won't be back.  There's just too many other great options.  I would meet friends there if asked, and if so, I'd get the chicken.  The place is also pretty loud and the tables are crowded.  Service has never been an issue, the wait-staff is very nice.",

They are big appetizers and everything comes with multiple dipping sauces!   We always eat the fried chicken - it's delicious! Also, an entree choice is a \"Side Plate\" - for only $10 you can get one plate of 3 sides! That's perfect for sharing or family style eating, plus the sides are delicious! The mashed potatoes & gravy are my favorite (with mac and cheese a close second).    Also, ask to sit in Jabari's section! He was our waiter during our most recent visit - very friendly, gave us good recommendations when we asked, and attentive to our table! :) what more could you ask for from a waiter?   My only -.5 would be because we had an abnormally long wait when we sat at the bar for one of our visits - and our bartender/waitress was texting on her phone while we were waiting to order and waiting to receive our check at the end.",

Found this restaurant on Yelp and needed a place near my parents house that accepted reservations and could accommodate 8 people for lunch the day after Thanksgiving for a surprise 80th birthday party/lunch for my mom. This restaurant totally delivered! The food was outstanding, generous portions, reasonably priced and the staff could not have been more accommodating. They gave us a room that was separated from the main restaurant which allowed us to hear each other and have our balloons and presents in a bit of privacy. The waitress was spot on and always had our glasses filled and every order was exactly right. They even allowed us to bring in a cake and provided a knife and plates and brought it out with candles lit. I can't thank them enough for making this occasion so special for us and for taking such good care of us and for providing outstanding food! I highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "My family and I have been to here numerous times since we lived so close by. Food and service were excellent for the first two years.  We have shared meals with friends here and referred people to eat there more times then I could count.   We recently moved further away and don't get to frequent them as often. The times that we do, we have noticed there has been a considerable decline in their food and service, with it getting worse with every visit.   The most recent visit which will be our last, was horrible. We have allergies in our family so there was some items that needed to be returned because they would cause an allergic reaction.  This is understandable, but apparently our server decided to write us off, and we went almost 20 minutes without seeing him again. I played around with the idea of talking with a manager, but he walked by our table 3 times, and never stopped to ask how our meal was.  Considering we had a few problems with our meal, we found it very unusual that the manager didn't do a table visit.  To me that would seem like management doesn't care either.   The restaurant hardly had anyone in it at the time we came in, so being busy or in the weeds wasn't an issue.   Because we have piculuaritis with our families meals when we eat out, we often tip well. He should be glad my wife was there to leave a tip, because for the first time in my life, eating out, I wasn't going to leave one.  Considering that the fried chicken meal starts at $14, this is not a cheap place to eat.    Go here if you would like to be disappointed.",

Very impressed with the shrimp wrap. They weren't stingy with the shrimp. This time I decided to dine in for lunch. I was dining alone at around 12:30 pm on a Friday. I thought that they would be packed but the place was almost empty. This was surprising to me given that they are the South Charlotte area and the food is good. Anyway, Abby was my server and she was very nice and friendly. She described several dishes and made recommendations. I ordered an alcoholic drink \"lemonade...\" something...can't remember the name. It was sweet and good. I ordered 2 appetizers- the zucchini fries and the fried green tomatoes. They were interesting - served with pimento cheese. Both had good portions and were DElicious!

    "text": "The building certainly looks fresher than the others around it, so it makes it stand out a bit.  It has a large covered dog friendly patio that looks very appealing.  The interior is also nicely done with that relaxed industrial modern feel.  There is ample seating and a very large bar.  While it's great to have a TV or two for the single bar patrons who need to zone out while eating alone - the size and number of the ones here was a bit distracting - giving it more of a bar hang out feel than casual restaurant.  The bartender I had was a bit leisurely.  She was nice and all, but seemed as if I waited around a while to order a drink, then even longer to order my food.  After my food arrived she only checked on me once and she just seemed weary.  Guess the lunch rush had worn her out before I got there.  The menu seems as if it wants to be a little more upscale southern food.  Now being a vegetarian in a place known for fried chicken can be a test, but they had several options on the menu for me.  I opted to try the zucchini fries so many speak of, the fried green tomatoes and the mac n cheese.  Being a southern girl the last two were going to have to be spot on to get my approval.  Regrettably they failed.  The zucchini fries were large spear cut sections with a nice batter, but where was this spice that so many talked about?  The batter just seemed salty to me.  The boom boom sauce was too much like a zesty mayonnaise to me, so when I did opt to dip I went with the ranch which was decent.  As for the FGT - well for starters if you are going to call them green - then that's what they should be.  These however were just tomatoes - fully ripe, soft, red tomatoes.  No green, crisp un-ripeness to them.  The pimento cheese was good, but it was all too rich with the boom boom sauce all around it.  The batter was also the same as the zucchini.  I prefer the lightness of a customary cornmeal batter on my FGT.  It really needed something to lighten it up.  As for the mac n cheese - my grandma would roll over in her grave if I even pretended it was good.  It didn't taste any better than the Velveeta stuff in a box.  Guess it did have fancier noodles than elbow, but it was a letdown.  The sangria was good however, spicy and tart!  I could see this place doing well as the after work hang out in the area, but not sure this is the place in Charlotte I'd suggest for visitors to go or if you're wanting to have that foodgasm experience.",

The service was friendly and prompt. Pricing was reasonable and the food was great. Our table had the shrimp wrap, cheese steak, and Cajun wings with an assortment of sides--all of it was excellent. We had the zucchini fries as an appetizer and they were very good as well.",

    "text": "Looks a lot better than Hotel Charlotte, less Charming, still they fixed it!  No hugs by an incomplete Stranger!!!    Since I did not speak Football, my \"server'\" quickly handed me off to someone who spoke, Hungry Chimp!  I'm so hungry I have to get an appetizer to have enough Brain power to read enough Menu to Order!  What's in a Name???  Leroy Fox!  First I'll ask some questions... Do I want these Zucchini Fries as L' Fox intended!!!  YES!!! They are GREAT an easy five stars, think about GREAT Fried Chicken, then replace the Chicken with Big Chunk Sticks of Zucchini!  WOW!!! Did NOT Believe until I tasted them, so Glad to-be-so-wrong! GREAT Flavor!  Fox Please keep these!!!  Forget what I said before!  One time Unbeliever, now BELIEVES!!!  Pretzel Appetizer!  You have my attention now tell me... \"Flash fried\" Sounds Great!  Not Great - AMAZING!!! !! !  My New Favorite Pretzel!  Wins the virtually unknown Rod0 award for Creative Geniusry!  Served with (you could lose stars for this) Ranch and Honey Mustard [next note : YOU better do better]... The Pretzels win 5 yelp stars!  More Creativity Needed on these sauces!  Burger!  I did not know they had Burgers, I had not read reviews and really NEVER planed on eating here. EVER! In fact I had planned to NEVER eat here ! ! !  If they did not have Burgers I would go to somewhere across the Lot!  They do have Burgers and they are Excellent! I will bring my Fiancee here so she can replicate the Bacon Marmalade so I can eat it at home on everything, especially a Large spoon! The Burger is \"Blended whole cuts of USDA Choice Short Rib and chuck\" ground and shaped somewhat burger-like! So when they saw my Camera during the appetizer they knew they could keep it slightly pink in the middle (not red, pink and barely and only in the middle,middle center) meaning PERFECTLY Cooked (hey George, bet you would like this one) They said they will make it more rare for you if you like! ! !  NEEDS some HELP!  Fox, are you listening ?  Fries too!  Their Fries are not as good as a few places (very few) still good enough for about 3.70 yelp stars - still these make my \"Lonely Fries\" yelp list!  The quantity of Fries is Gargantuan (as a side with a Burger).  Need A LOT of HELP ! ! !   Mac and Cheese PLEASE START Over or REMOVE this Dish!  Better REMOVE it!  Very Poor!   Pasta Salad (NO Mayo Yay!) the Flavor is too BLAH!  Revamp or Get rid of it!  Sauces: : With the Exception of the Very Exceptional Bacon Marmalade the Sauces need work (they are the opposite of Good) Fox, you came up with Bacon Marmalade your Creativity can NOT end there!!!  How about a Moonshine BBQ Sauce???  Dessert???  Consider two things:   1.)   I'm getting Dessert, here or somewhere right after I leave   2.)   Sitting before you are two Men (both me) one you should be Very afraid of, now where is my Dessert!!!  It all sounded too healthy for me!  Here are my ideas for FOX * * * Note to the Owners maybe something like Beignets or some Deep-fried dough delight Dipped in Chocolate, then sprinkle Powdered Sugar on top and serve it with a little Toyota on the side, maybe some kind of exotic Gelato!  Break the Bank or Millionaires Coffee if you must have it so healthy!    3.)   Dessert on Fire - Use someones Imagination and get on it Fox!  Is this a Sports Bar???  PLEASE Do NOT tell me because that would ruin it for me (I hate Sports and Sports Bars)!  I would never ask someone who works here... Because, really do I want to know?  Nine TV's Mmmm I think it is a Sports Bar, ooohhps 10 counting the one outside... No TV in the Boys Room!  That  is a dead-giveaway unless it is the only one in the place... Gotta be able to check the scores, right?  Right!  More enjoyable and better food than Hotel Charlotte and still some of the old H.C. Doors!  Boys Room is almost the same, very close friends of complete strangers, still better than incomplete ones!  Advantage Leroy Fox - No one at the Door offering to hug me, Nor in the Boys Room!!!  Boys Room has a Working Lock on the Door - Advantage Leroy Fox!  Justin Kasee!  Girl walks in takes a seat at the Bar  (True Story) orders a Beer and chats with the Staff - She is looking for a job (HERE)... I think this was a good approach to get comfortable with the Staff!  Did they hire Her? These are NOT the Jokes!",

I ordered the cheese steak sandwich and had them put it into a wrap for me. I was worried about this cause most places dont do it correct and there never any meat and thin slice of tomato etc. This was the opposite,  stuffed with meat and thick Slice if tomato, mushrooms,  onions it was awesome.  I would recommend this to anyone you have to try it. Ok, now for the side. I wanted something different and they had several unique and different side choices. The bartender said I had to get the hashbrown casserole, OMG it was incredible.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The night before we left Charlotte, we decided to go to Mert's downtown, but when we got there, we discovered that once again we had managed to visit North Carolina during a basketball tournament.  Parking was pretty hard to find, traffic was heavy and we decided we would not get into the restaurant, so we used our fall-back, Leroy fox, based on reviews for the fried chicken.  Ms T had chicken fried chicken, which is a breast that is fried and served with pepper gravy.  She substituted mac 'n cheese and grits for her sides.  I had fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and green bean casserole.  The fried chicken is good, a little non-traditional with a fairly heavy coating.  The coating is however, crisp and well salted.  The chicken was moist and hot.  There was plenty of black pepper and a fair amount of sage in the coating making it somewhat unique.  I did like it.  Ms T's chicken fried chicken was Ok, nothing really special.  We both found the pepper gravy to be too pasty thick, like it is only thickened with flour and not cooked down cream, but it also had good black pepper flavor, which I like.  The mashed potatoes were certainly home made.  The cheese grits had good corn flavor and were not overcheesed.  The mac 'n cheese was cavetappi with a smooth white cheese sauce.  It was a creamy style, not baked or if baked, not in a small pan that allows it to setup.  The green bean casserole was the only miss for me.  The green beans had a lot of strings in them so Leroy needs to find a better supplier of green beans.  I don't know where you would even go to find green beans that are stringy these days.  The casserole was over thickened a little.  All in all this is pretty good food.  I would say strong three stars, not quite four, but it wouldn't take much to fix a few details and be there.",

The regular fried chicken is the highlight; however, the sides are awful.  The gravy is thicker than pudding and tasteless.  The mashed potatoes are mixed with so much sour cream they don't even taste like potatoes and then they are covered in more of that gloppy gravy.     By far the worst though was my husband's \"Nashville\" fried chicken.  It was so greasy it left pools of grease on the bottom of his plate.  The taste wasn't spicy...mostly just burnt flavored.  We should have sent it back but didn't.    In addition to the bad food, the staff is young, inexperienced and flippant.   Many of them stand around the kitchen door and chat as opposed to waiting on tables.    Last time for sure.",

    "text": "Leroy Fox (L.R.) is slowly becoming my new favorite restaurant/sports bar in Charlotte.  You know that excitement you get from the beginning stages of a new-relationship?  You know those \"butterfly-feelings\" women are always talking about??  Well that's exactly how I feel about Leroy Fox!   Let's start with the food.  The fried chicken ranks as some of the best I've ever had anywhere on planet earth.  I'm talking BETTER than Price's, better than Chicken box and better than your grandma's!!  Yep, I said it!  I usually go with the \"1/4 North\" which includes a wing and breast, but they also have the \"1/4 South\" (leg and thigh), and other combinations.  No matter what pieces of chicken you get, it's all fried to perfection.  Went here last week with a buddy and though it took some time for the chicken to arrive to us at the bar, it came pipping hot.  I love that they don't over-fry the chicken - its always really moist on the inside and full of flavor (that's what she said - LOL).  I've also had the \"Fox Den wings\" on multiple occasions and can say they are excellent and very underrated as far as wings go.  Yes folks, I would also put these wings right up there with some of the best in Charlotte.  They are perfectly seasoned, charred (for no up-charge a la Hickory Tavern), and are served with a cold, healthy, serving of ranch or blue cheese.  I usually run the fries or sweet potato tots as my sides - both are great.  I would warn against the mac-n-cheese however - its all mac, and no cheese if you know what I mean.    I've sat at a table before, and although there weren't any notable concerns, I found it to be a bit slow.  Ever since, I've dined and drank at the bar.  The bartenders are always super friendly, willing to strike-up a convo, and willing to accommodate any request you may have.  I don't know if its the location in the heart of Cotswold, the spacious, comfy bar, or the super-chill bartenders, but there's definitely a unique, friendly, southern vibe to Leroy Fox.  From the looks...or TASTE of things, this is going to be a one long lasting relationship!",

Overall, decent experience, but the prices reflect the cost of living in downtown Charlotte, rather than the quality of the food.

Once we arrived we were seated quickly although it was March Madness Duke vs. Michigan State game.

    "text": "This place is a disaster. We came at 1pm on a Sunday, the restaurant was around 30% full. We were seated immediately and the server came up to take our order promptly which was great, but then things started to go down hill from there. First, there was a significant amount of food under our table. As in, no one cleaned up after the toddler party before us. Our server didn't come back to refill our drinks for several minutes after they were empty. We were wondering where our server was most of the time actually. We were delighted they offered stevia sweetener, until we asked for more and the server said \"we're usually out of it.\" She didn't even look for more, that was it! Our food came and the chicken was great. The fries were not. It was obvious they had been sitting for a while or were perhaps reheated. Also, the side salad had chickpeas in it. What's up with that? That's just weird and annoying.   This place had good fried chicken, but everything else was a sad performance. Get it together!",

In addition to a great selection of food, their kitchen is open late on Sunday nights. I recommend their buffalo chicken nachos (grilled), buffalo chicken salad, and their grilled chicken club wrap. My sister loves their sweet potato fries and their pimento and egg chicken sandwich. They also have a great variety of cocktails. My favorite is the champagne mojito. Seriously, i could drink like 5, they're amazing!   i definitely appreciate their kitchen being open late since my boyfriend sometimes works late on Sundays and its one of two nights he has off, so Leroy Fox gives us that chance to eat great food after 9pm on Sundays. :)",

I had the chicken salad sandwich, which had light mayo and a good flavor on homemade-like bread. In fact I took half the sandwich home as leftovers since it was a generous size. The sweet tots were the main attraction--seriously the warm, fragrance and hint of sugar made these sides the main event! I wanted a whole bowl of sweet potato tots. We also shared an app of zucchini \"fries\" that had a yummy dipping sauce.     The parking lot is tiny so I parked nearby and walked over to LF. We didn't have drinks but I hear they have a good list. Excellent service!",

The table had an array of food between the perfectly crispy fried chicken, the amazing zucchini fries, the fried chicken sandwich, BLTA, and a bunch of other things.  The zucchini fries definitely deserved all the rave I've heard and I don't know how anyone can make hot pretzel bites taste so good but they managed.  Hailing from Miami and dining with all southerners, they were all more than satisfied with Leroy Fox's. We will definitely be back on a regular basis.   They only lost one star on a personal taste level - the live music on Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays. While the musician was fantastic and the choice of music was wonderful and the concept is great, for a restaurant that's a little smaller in size, it was a bit too loud. For being 9 at night on a week day and being a restaurant and not a bar or lounge, I wasn't ecstatic that we could hardly hear one another. However, this will not stop us from returning. It's too good not to go back!!",

    "text": "So I've been wanting to try Leroy Fox ever since they opened.  Much to my surprise, my boyfriend took me there last night for Valentine's Day.    My first impressions were: YAY, they're working on outdoor patio seating out front. That will be nice in the spring / summer / fall.  The interior is so nice & cozy...I love the wall with all the street names.  The bar has plenty of seating. There was in excess of 5 or 6 TVs.    We were seated immediately upon arrival (we had 6 PM reservations).  Brittney, our waitress came to our table as soon as we sat down. She was very upbeat & friendly.  She had great recommendations on drinks - she talked me into The Hotel Charlotte martini & my boyfriend had the King of Foxes whiskey drink - they have a whiskey club you can join!  For our meal, we decided on the fried chicken sandwich with mac & cheese for me & Shawn got the 1/4 north foxing fried chicken, with the mashed potatoes & peppered gravy.  We waited less than 10 minutes for our food to come out.  While waiting, our water glasses stayed full.  We were VERY pleased at the presentation...the food looked delicious - & the taste of it matched!  The portions were huge (we decided there was no way we could have eaten an appetizer along with our entrees)! The chicken (on my sandwich & the foxing fried chicken) were lightly seasoned & breaded, juicy & tender. The mac & cheese & mashed potatoes!!!!! HEAVENLY. If I were stranded on a desert island, I want these two sides with me!  These are probably the best restaurant sides I've had in Charlotte.  The cornbread muffins were baked perfectly & were moist inside. YUM.  We ate our entire meal & felt just the right amount of full.  During the meal, Brittney came by frequently & checked on us & we had a manager come by, too.    Extra details: the fox theme is throughout the restaurant - waiters & male bar staff wear shirts that say \"Sly\" & waitresses wear ones that say \"Vixen\".  Beverage glasses have a fox etched on them. I love the color choices on the dinnerware. Nice white plates & turquoise bowls for the sides.  Neat design on the chicken tenders appetizer - wire basket, with 3 holders for dipping sauces.  Appetizers are in portions that could serve as a meal.  At 6 PM, they weren't busy yet, but about 30 - 45 minutes later, it began filling up.  The noise level is normal with customer & wait staff chatter. Prices are reasonable.  While I expected this place to be \"grown folks\" only, there were several families dining.  We've already decided this will be a regular spot for us. Long live Leroy Fox!",

Very trendy but not overly done. Inside seating was a little tight, but not terrible. There were TVs to watch, seats were comfortable and the place was clean. The host was friendly and so were the waitresses.   I ordered the 1/4 South with Mac & Cheese. While it was not exactly what I was hoping for, it was delicious! It was more of a modern twist to a southern comfort meal. Don't get me wrong, it really was outstanding! The chicken was lightly fried, the skin was crispy and the cornbread was perfect. The macaroni, which was a surprise, was a in a runny cheese sauce instead of the thick cheesy mess I was hoping for. It was still great though!  I went on a Thursday night and it was still relatively busy, but I hope to go back on a Friday night and hear some of the live music.",

Since it's not far from where I live, and the prices reasonable, I agree with Angie P.  This is going to be a regular spot!   The environment on a Friday night is kind of loud, but very warm and inviting.  Not sure how to describe it but \"Southern Plantation\" -ish style.  (Think, perfect place for a date, or to catch up with friends and chat.) Not pretentious at all-- wear whatever you want, and you'll be comfortable. Our server was just a doll and provided us great service and was knowledgeable about the menu.   (Example: The famous chicken is brined for 24 hours, and the pretzels are flash fried (which is why they're soooo good) and served with a homemade cheese sauce, ranch and honey mustard dip.)   I feel I can't give 5 stars yet, only because I need to try more of the menu.  But my dining partners all loved their fried chicken and sides.  My shrimp and grits were pretty great-- though I would have loved some sausage in it too.  (Still, by far, the E2 Emeril grits are my #1 in Charlotte!)   Stay tuned for a follow-up review soon!",

When we asked what the issue was, we were told it would be about 15 more minutes as there were 2 more parties before us. Then we watched a party of 6 THAT ARRIVED AFTER US get seated. When we asked if they took reservations, the hostess said no-and when we asked why we werent getting seated we were told it was because there were smaller parties ahead of us-and when we pointed out the 6 top that got seated, she back tracked and said, ohhhhh well maybe they did have reservations. Ohhhhhh, well maybe if you stopped wiping down menus and ran an efficient seating chart, this wouldn't happen. Then we were told it would be another 15 minutes!!!! No thanks. We left and went elsewhere-and I'd advise you to do the same.",

Give me the original fried chicken sandwich and some cheap miller lite and I am happy and Leroy Fox serves both, all the time.   I have tried several other menu items and the only thing I am not a fan of is the mac n cheese (just find it to be bland). My husband loves the BBQ peach (insert some type of meat) salad. The first time he had it, he talked about it for days. The next couple of times, he just talks about how he still can't believe how good it is.   I like to get one of the big booths in the back or grab a seat at the bar. I find some of the table seating to be awkward, but I am like that everywhere I go. The service is always fine and this has quickly become our go to spot when neither the hubs or myself want to make a decision about where we should eat.   Just a heads up- it can get kind of loud in the space, especially on live music nights but that isn't enough to keep me away. I think it is just a sign of a fun place full of people having a good time.",

Service was great both times with food coming out quickly, glasses always filled and attention to detail.  Wide variety on the menu from several sandwich options, salads and bigger entrees.  First time out, I had their basic burger called \"the prohibited burger\" and it was quite tasty with the combination of short rib and chuck in their ground mixture. Also, since they grind their own beef in house, they can cook it to your liking.  Second time out, I had the BBQ Chick Chopped Peach salad, which had chopped peaches, red onions, tomatoes, cheddar and grilled bbq chicken with sweet vidalia onion dressing.  I was a little skeptical going in, but was pleasantly surprised how all the ingredients worked together.  My only issue with the salad was the amount of dressing, which was excessive for me.  I will ask for the dressing on the side in the future, but I would certainly order this salad again.  All in all, really good food and atmosphere at Leroy Fox, and they look like they have a good adult beverage menu as well.  I will have to return to check out the libations.",

The food was pretty good overall. The fried green tomatoes were excellent with the spicy pimento cheese! I could eat a million of those. The buffalo wings were nicely grilled and equally as spicy.  My main course of chicken fried chicken was good, but it was missing some spice and/or flavor. Also, the little cornbread muffins were delicious.",

Pretzel app was good. However, our food took forever!!!!  Manager was standing at the bar the entire time doing absolutely nothing. Our server was great but for as long as the food took to come out, and considering the place had about two other tables sat, I found no reason for our food to take that long and then have the nerve to be sent out luke warm.  We always tip well, and our again our server was great.  Probably won't be back though since we live in University area and have many better choices to choose from.",

Here's what we had: PRETZEL BITES: we opted for the cheese dip, which was good but so is the ranch and honey mustard that these come with. I think these are deep fried pretzels and oh man are they good.  PIMENTO AND EGG CHICKEN SANDWICH: hello! Perfect chicken oozing with pimento with bacon and a fried egg on top! Whoa nelly! HONEY BUFFALO CHICKEN SANDWICH: sweet and spicy, with buffalo cheese and these amazing sweet green tomatoes (kind of like pickles, but so much better) SIDE OF MACARONI AND CHEESE: creamy and perfect SWEET POTATO TOTS: soft, lovely nuggets of golden goodness with yummy honey mustard dipping sauce BANANA PUDDING: okay... Here's the one thing we didn't like. It was like they forgot to add milk, it was so thick, almost like a custard and my friend with a super sweet tooth even said it was too sweet for her. Something seemed wrong with it. We should have sent it back but we were too full anyways.",

    "text": "Not sure why it took me to long to check out Leroy Fox, this place is super fly.  I love the rustic but sleek exterior: gray washed beams, with cute pergola topped patio. The interior has just as much personality. As a design nerd, I totally fell in love with the exposed brick, paneled ceiling, and mouding. Along the walls are super cute vintage-looking prints of animals on book pages, LOVE. I also wanna give props to the amount of seating in this place, especially all the booths.  My only complaint is that the menu is not especially vegetarian friendly. There are some appetizers to choose from, and then sides (you can make a sides plate: $11) This place seems way too cool to be ignorant of all of us herbivores...  I ordered a \"Sideways Plate\" which comes with your choice of three sides. I ordered the mac n cheese, cheese grits, and zucchini fries. I ALMOST ordered the green bean casserole, but luckily I had our server check with the kitchen and yes, it's made with chicken stock... BOO! No fair. The mac n cheese was ok. Good, but nothing special, won't waste my time with this again. The cheese grits were pretty good, but not my favorite in town, but I'll definitely order them again. The shining star of my plate was the ZUCCHINI STICKS. Oh boy, these things have a ZING! Super crispsy, chunky, and filling. At first I thought it was the sauce, but the breading on these things is spicy. I like moderately spicy things and these sticks hurt so good. If you like foods with a little zip, make sure you try the zucchini sticks.  The staff here were excellent. Nice, helpful, attentive. Kudos.",

The food was good, but I think it was the clean, well placed table and overall feel of the restaurant that truly added to my overall satisfaction. I felt comfortable and relaxed as I ate and enjoyed the predominantly mellow crowd.   Now for the food. My husband ordered the fried chicken and macaroni and cheese, which was accompanied by cornbread and white gravy. I had the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado...although I had mine without the avocado), and the shoestring french fries. Everything was good, however I found the macaroni and cheese to be a little bland. Salt and pepper probably would have remedied that. My BLT(A) was great!!!  I loved the pickled green tomatoes that added a bit of sweetness to my savory sandwich. The white gravy complemented the fried chicken very nicely. I would no doubt return to this restaurant.  Next time I might eat outside on the lovely front patio....it looked lovely!!",

    "text": "Great southern food here with a little more of a \"upscale\" vibe to its presentation.  I just had a few of the appetizers and a couple bites of the chicken sandwich but everything tasted great. The mac and cheese is very good and prepared with a white cheese and absolutely delicious. The hot pretzels are also a good app and served with 3 dipping sauces (honey mustard, ranch and a cheese sauce). I also tried the chicken tenders which were fried to perfection in my opinion. Not too over done, soggy or underdone. Everyone I was with (a large party of 14) seemed to like their meals. We had a lot of members of the \"clean plate club\" with us that evening.   The food seems to be reasonably priced but the beers, starting at 3,25 for domestic up to 5.5 for imports, are a little on the high end. Also, we tried one of the specialty drinks (maybe the peach tea? I can't remember) and it was served in a small mason jar and very tasty but the specialty drinks can run at up to 10$ a pop. I guess you could say overall this place is moderately priced on the food and a little high end on the drinks.   The one bad thing I would comment on is that our server, while being very good at running our orders and checking up on us seemed a little too friendly with the females at our table. If one of the guys placed a order he would just kinda give em a dead pan look and fetch whatever you asked for but if one of the ladies placed a order man was he all \"hey how you doing?\" and smiles across the board.",

    "text": "POOR MANAGEMENT, SERVICE and CARRY OUT. I am really sad to write this review. We actually sometimes travel from NY to Charlotte just to eat Fried Chicken at this place and of course stay at the Ritz and enjoy the pool and spa, but that's besides the point. This trip I came with my Mom and daughter to go furniture shopping in High Point. We ate fried chicken twice in 3 days at Leroy Fox and decided to take some home on the plane to my husband and father. We ordered two winner winner chicken dinners which is basically two whole chickens and 4 large sides. When we got the food we didn't check it to make sure it was correct and to our surprise we were missing a whole chicken. We didn't realize this until we were back in Brooklyn!  I called and the management was pretty rude telling me we must have lost it or misplaced it and they were sure we had it because the staff said they put it in there. Do you REALLY think your staff would admit if they forgot to put a whole chicken in a carry out bag????  Do they really think we would call to try to get a free chicken?????  Do you think that many to go containers can fit in one bag, which is what we were given....1 bag?  Come on people. These people need to go to Customer Service 101. We didn't even want our $$ back necessarily, but some acknowledgment of the problem and apology or offer to fix it would have been appreciated instead of being made to feel like a crazy person trying to get a free chicken, lol.   Other problems we had that day was our server was so new she didn't even know the menu and messed up our lunch order and the breasts and wings were dry and way over fried by the kitchen, which btw has happened many times but we usually overlook it because they will correct the problem and bring fresh chicken out. The other BIG MISTAKE on their part is they put the 1 chicken we did get in the to go containers right out of the fryer and brought us the to go order right after we started eating. They should have let the chicken sit to cool down before packing it. AMATEURS!!!!  We ended up with 1 soggy chicken back in Brooklyn.  We used to tell all of our friends and colleagues who live in Charlotte and New York about this place. We can no longer do that as we wouldn't know what kind of service, treatment or quality of food they will get.  GONE DOWN HILL LEROY SINCE WE STARTED EATING THERE 4 YEARS AGO!!",

A cool but relaxed and unpretentious ambiance with huge plasma TV screens that will satisfy any football-loving boyfriend or dad.  And the food - not even worth me elaborating on, b/c I'm just gonna lose my entire evening describing how absolutely delicious, succulent, generous, and crazy good everything is.  MUST HAVE = Zucchini fries.  They DO deserve to be \"world famous,\" like their menu says.  The dips that come with the appetizer are amazing too - remind you a lot of the ranch & chipotle dip that California Pizza Kitchen offers with their Avocado Club Egg Rolls.  So far, I've tried their Shrimp & Grits - very generously sized and great quality.  My sister had their BBQ Chicken Sandwich - um, to die for.  Definitely recommend.  Overall, everyone should give this place a try & give it some serious business.  No complaints over here!",

Looked like it was left over from the day before and reheated, it was that bad.  My sons catfish was so greasy it was floating in oil and he could not eat much of it.  We did not complain to anyone while there as you get what you are served and we vote on a restaurants food by either going back, or not.  Leroy fox will not be a place we go back to.  We have a chance and so eat out @3-4 times a week trying different places and revisiting the ones we like often.

    "text": "Must say that Leroy Fox has carved out a nice little space for themselves along Sharon Amity. Most of the other locations are lackluster in appearance and seem to get lost in your passing commute.   Leroy Fox is just the opposite. The entire facade stands out with layered, aged beams of grayish brown wood. The juxtaposition of each piece of wood seems to exhibit the careful, yet disheveled, look of the exterior. It goes without being said. This place just looks bad ass.   The interior is HUGE. Much larger than one would anticipate. Mounds of tables and a rather long, full-service and fully stocked bar. A conservative amount of TV's line the walls above the bar. Not too distracting like some other restaurant/bars. Tons of great beers on draught. Locals, too. NoDa and a few from OMB.   The service was fast, friendly and helpful. Didn't visit the table too often, didn't ask too many questions or hound for an up-sell. Just the right amount.   The food...woo. Where to start?   Pretzels: Great. slightly crunchy and neatly seasoned with salt. Three dips to choose from: cheese, ranch and fantastic honey mustard.   Sliders: Beef was so flavorful and smokey. A welcome aroma. Pretty sure on mini brioche buns. Perfect as a standalone or an app split amongst all diners.   Mac n' cheese: Let's just say, if you don't end up getting it, I feel sorry for your taste buds.   My fellow diners had a salad with fried chicken and the tiger shrimp wrap. The wrap looked nice and fresh. Would definitely consider for a lunch option. The salad looks great with nice helpings of lightly battered and fried...uhh fried chicken. I had the serendipitous opportunity to try a piece of the chicken. Divine.   Next time, I'm trying the fried chicken as an entree. This place knows the way to a southerner's heart (in a good way).   Looking forward to many visits in the near future!",

It's thanks to South Beach farm to table operations like Yardbird that really set my palate straight. Then I traveled to Charlotte where my local expert led me in the direction of recently opened, Leroy Fox.   This gastronomy focused Southern pub features indoor dining options fit for anyone searching out a finely casual eatery or even an outdoor patio to welcome the hens looking to bask beneath a beating sun. The latter was our choice. Whether you're after a crafty cold brew or a serious spirit, there's a full menu of regional beers and mixology forward cocktails.  For starters, the hot pretzel appetizer arrived with a bouquet of dipping sauces. Between the cheese, honey mustard and ranch, I found my mini pretzels readily diving into the honey mustard time and time again. Then, feeling somewhere between good and glutton, I opted for the fried chicken salad.   I mean, sure, I'll take some greens with my delicately fried tenderloins. Everything danced together wonderfully... naturally, considering fried chicken was in the room. Then again, at Leroy's, \"chickens are fresh, all natural, hormone free and blessed.\" Yes, they're blessed... which must have something to do with how godly they taste going down.  Next time, I'm running for the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado).",

The other two times, the servers were slow--not checking back to see how our food was, not refilling drinks, etc.  Last time, our server was outright rude.  She made several mistakes (forgot our appetizer, cornbread, did not refill water) and only offered a half-hearted apology.  She rolled her eyes at my husband.  Just totally uncalled for.  Honestly, I love their food, but I probably won't go back here when there are so many other options in Charlotte.  They really need to invest in some server training.  Also, it would help to have a manager out walking the floor.  I have never seen a manager here, and would definitely have welcomed the chance to give feedback in person rather than on Yelp.  I really wanted to like this place, but I don't because of the poor service.",

Ya I am lame because I got a side salad.    The chicken itself was tender and juicy.  The batter was gourmet-ish.  It was salty and tasty.  Definitely trying to make it fancy instead of good-ol Price's Chicken Coup style.  It was very good!  And it came with a little container of gravy - i had never had this combination before and I guess you are supposed to eat the two together - YUM!!!!  It was fantastic!!  We will definitely be back!!!",

The wait staff was slow (long time to get drinks, extra dressing, not checking up, etc.) and the kitchen took a long time (45 minutes) to get two salads! Yikes!",

The Southwest salad that my coworker had was topped with blackened chicken and I sampled it.  It was so delicious and I'm not a chicken person.  The salad dressing was the house and had a mix of  sriracha and sweetness to it. I had the beet salad and it was wonderful as well. Fried beets, avocado, and goat cheese with a white vinaigrette.    The prices are the only thing that gets you. $12 for a salad at lunchtime? Really ridiculous.  I took one star away for that.  I would love to go there for lunch every time I'm in the area, but unfortunately I don't have $12-15 to spend on a lunch salad.  My coworker added blacked chicken and her salad was $16!!!!!!!!! WHHHHHAT?!  They should really look into some lunch menu options with more reasonable price points.",

I had the shrimp n grits which were some of the tastiest I've had in Charlotte with good sized tasso ham and even a sunny-side-up egg on top. You can get it without the egg which would still be great too. My wife had the chicken fried chicken. The sausage gravy on it made the dish. The green bean casserole is excellent. The Mac n cheese is also good...which is saying a lot because I don't really care for Mac typically.  We went around 6:30 on a Friday night and had great service.",

We started out with cocktails, and they do have a nice selection. I got a blueberry smash which was yummy & refreshing without being overly sweet.   I dont eat a lot of fried chicken on a regular basis, so of course being here, I decided to splurge and get that instead of a salad.  I went with 1/4 north which comes with 2 sides and a biscuit. I chose the mac & cheese and succotash.  Honestly, the chicken was not as good as I remembered it being. It was good but not the best fried chicken I have had. The crust didn't have the same spicy kick I remembered. The chicken was tender & juicy, but just lacked a killer crust.  Now, the mac & cheese on the other hand was better than I remembered it being here. I could have just eaten this and been happy!   Sadly, I did not enjoy their succotash at all. It was wayyyyyy too onion-y.  I don't mind a little bit of onion in succotash but this was so bad, you couldn't get a bite without having a mouth full of onions. Bleh!   One other disappointment was the biscuit & gravy. I would actually prefer a good piece of cornbread instead of a biscuit.  Especially since their biscuit is ok but not as good as grandma's. The white gravy was bland as well. Hardly any flavor there.  Of course, we were too full to order dessert but I bet there are some good things to be had here.   Overall, I still like the Fox, but next time i think I will branch out & order something different here.",

They were so good and so soft! I ordered the 1/4 chicken, Mac and cheese, and the Brussel sprouts. I really liked the Brussels sprouts especially because they had bacon in them and were seasoned really well! The Mac and cheese was also good! The chicken was okay. The skin could use a bit more seasoning but the boom boom sauce was really good! It also comes with syrup but I didn't use it and very large portions! I probably wouldn't go back for the fried chicken but definitely for the sides!   10/10 for customer service it was excellent and they even turned on a light for us when we wanted to picture!",

I tried the blueberry smash drink and it was good, but the food is the star of the show. I've gotten the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole, which was awesome but super filling. I've also gotten the chicken tenders with fries, added on mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is one of the best as well, crispy breadcrumbs are baked on top of the creamy noodles. All in all, one of my favorite restaurants with options to please everyone, especially kids and picky eaters.",

First off, thanks for not judging me when I come into this restaurant on a weekday sweaty from Flywheel.  Second, this place has a nice mix of healthy and indulgent options.  I'm a big fan of restaurants that stick to their cuisine and style, but offer a variety on the menu.  I usually order a salad with Grilled Chicken, and it always comes out correct (hey, what can I say, to me, the menu is a starting point of ingredients for me to add/take off).  Their chicken and waffles is great if you're there for brunch!  Their outdoor area is really nice when the weather is right.  I sat out here last time and the waiter was completely attentive, which is hard sometimes to find someone when you need something and you're not actually in the restaurant.  I would recommend this place for the following situations: 1. You're hungry after a flywheel class and need a casual place to have a great meal with a friend. 2. You want to watch a game.  Lots of TVs! 3. You're on a double date or with a group of friends and you need a place that's a lively atmosphere, but you can still hear people talk. 4. You're by yourself and just want to have a drink and dinner at the bar.",

    "text": "If there's a place in town that's super slept on, it has to be Leroy Fox. Why? Because this place, hands down, has some of the best fried chicken that I had in this city. Golden, crispy, succulent, juicy, tender and just simply a well executed fried chicken. From their Chicken Fried Chicken dish to their Fried Chicken Pimento & Egg Sandwich, this is some of the best fried chicken that I had in a very long time. Not greasy or burnt or simply tasteless. It is what fried chicken should truly and always taste like.   Their culinary chops don't stop there. If you're a big fan of Mac & Cheese, Green Bean Casserole, Mashed Potatoes and some delicious Nachos, this is the place to go as well. Trust me, it is well seasoned, to the point you don't need any salt to get those exquisite flavors flowing through your taste buds. Now, the portions are kind of small. But trust me, it'll get you full. Take it from a guy, that'll eat not just my plate, but your plate as well.   The servers are extremely courteous, professional and engaging. You can tell they love the place, and I don't blame them. Plus, I love their music selection.   Now, I know you're wondering, why did it only get 4 out of 5 stars, if this place is soooo good? To answer that question, it was based on consistency. The night before as a great example, the Mac and cheese was oozing with cheesiness, that'll melt in your mouth. However, the next day, although the Mac and Cheese was good, the quality wasn't as cheesy. To be honest, I didn't see any of that mornay sauce that they slapped on the night before, and that Mac and Cheese was extremely dry. It had a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top, but that cheese sauce was non existent.   Would I eat here again? The answer is a HELL YEAH!   Just please have some consistency. After all, nobody wants to go to a place where you are playing Russian Roulette in the quality of the dish.",

I like the word play and the drink was very good and strong. See pics.  Service was ok but could have been more attentive. Seemed like the focus was on closing, but they still had an hour to close. We ordered the jalapeno pimento cheese appetizer, and it was good. I wish it was a little but warmer but it had a great taste.  I ordered the naked tenders, they were grilled and tossed with honey buffalo sauce. I would have had more sauce, especially since there was no breading for the sauce to stick to. See pics.  I had enough for lunch the next day.   The grade was very disappointing to me with it being a 90. I may come back again just for a drink.",

We were given a drink menu and we said we would be ordering food then sat for a good 10 minutes waiting for our drinks and appetizer to be taken.  We started off with the pimento cheese app. I've heard very good things about it and it did live it up all the talk. Pita bread was warm and ohhh that cheese. So good! Plenty for two!  Service got better and we chatted with our bar neighbors. They gave us food recommendations and talked about Leroy Fox's new location.   For my entree, I decided to get the sideways plate (three sides of your choosing). I got the sweet potato tots, side salad and mac and cheese. Those tots were delicious! They were covered in cinnamon sugar and came with a side of honey mustard. I normally don't like honey mustard but this stuff was good. The mac and cheese was oh soo delicious. My salad dressing was homemade (I forget what kind) but it was different and good.   I actually would return and order the exact same thing! :) I was very happy with my food choices.",

We also enjoyed the mac and cheese and the salad dressings have to made in house they were so good. Oh and a small history lesson, the doors that line the wall are from Hotel Charlotte. Hotel Charlotte opened in 1924 and was demolished in 1988.",

    "text": "Went here last night and I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the food.  We started off with the zucchini fries and pretzels with different sauces.  The honey mustard sauce with the pretzels and the 'boom boom' sauce with the zucchini fries were my favorite.  I wasn't very hungry, so just got the grilled Buffalo salad, which was very good; love the dressing.  Everyone's meals looked great. Wish I wasn't full going there or I would have stolen from their plates.  I would like to try the pimiento cheese appetizer next time.  The dirty martini was perfect and the Leroy's lemonade was great - love any drink that comes in a mason jar.  The atmosphere was very loud and there were a lot of kids there, so this will be a family night out type of restaurant going forward, vs. dinner with friends/sans kids.  Our waitress was fantastic - knowledgeable about everything on the menu, friendly and very accommodating.   Will definitely be one of our go to restaurants when we go out with the kids.",

I find the food lacking, with the exception of the savory creamy pimento cheese and pita appitizer.  Awesome!t  Obviously, LF is known for fried chicken, so the menu features A LOT of chicken dishes, too many if you ask me.  I went for the chicken fried chicken wih mac and cheese and my friend Lauryn ordered the chicken grill.  My chicken filet was over breaded and too spare on the gravy.  My other side with the mac and cheese was another specialty, the fried zucchini. The zucchini also suffered from an overload of the same batter as my entree.  I did enjoy the creamy white cheese mac and cheese on curly tube pasta (sorry don't remember the italian name for the noodles.) The patio is a relaxing with a rustic vibe and some beautiful hanging plants.  You can tell a lot of thought was put into the patio and it shows.  Our cocktails were quite yummy too.  I had the Selwyn Ave. and  Lauryn chose the Sassy martini, we followed them with Red Sangria (her) and an ice cold Stella for me.

My friend wanted to try Leroy Fox because she heard they had a Bloody Mary bar on Sundays, but unfortunately, when we arrived, they didn't. I won't complain about the $4 bloody mary special though, and when I asked for spicy, they definitely delivered. Best bloody I have had in Charlotte (but I hear Boudreaux makes a mean one).  We enjoyed drinks on the patio while waiting for a table outside (we were in a couch,c hair situation). However, everyone who had a table outside never wanted to give theirs up, so after about 1.5 hours of drinks, we realized we still wanted to eat, so moved inside for brunch (it's still brunch if it is 3pm right?).  I really wanted an omelet, but their omelet station closes at 230, so I settled for a traditional fried chicken sando and mac and cheese. SO GOOD. I also shared the pretzel bites with a friend. Definitely get the queso dip with those.  I would love to come back to try some breakfast food (the french toast looked amazing). Overall, the food was solid, our waitress was attentive and it totally was a satisfying brunch. Nom.",

The pretzel bites and the zucchini fries (more like sticks) are fantastic.  The dipping sauces are great!  The boom boom sauce is perfectly spicy... I wish I could recreate this at home.   Dinner:  I did not enjoy my dinner.  Get the fried chicken.  My husband did enjoy his buffalo chicken sandwich.  I had some kind of salad-- obviously not a great choice in a bar but there veggie selection is limited-- it was not great but what is great is their brunch.  I prefer that to their dinner menu.  They also offer bottomless mimosas and bloody marys but-- good grief-- who can partake in that at noon on a Sunday?  Not me.  If you can, stop reading right now and say a prayer of thanksgiving.   The french toast, the omelet, the toast and grits, is all great.  They have a good beer selection on tap.  What they do not have is a good wine selection... this is definitely an area in which they can (and should) improve.  They have several specialty cocktails which usually are good.  There bloody marys are delish... especially the bloody martin.    They have a cute little side room that you can reserve for parties. They have also been generous in the community, hosting fundraisers of various sorts.  Their marketing campaign-- Leroy Fox for President-- was awesome.  I loved seeing those signs in front yards.  \"Free chicken for everyone.\"  This area needed this spot.  Hotel Charlotte had seen its better days... and the face lift and the thorough cleaning this spot got is great.  Even the restrooms aren't awful anymore.  I wish they had left the train running around the ceiling...  This is also a fun place to watch a game.",

Service was great both times even though the waitress made sure to point out that the burgers were pricey. They will customize your order. The burger was quite tasty. I did not enjoy the bacon marmalade as I did not know it was made with onions (that was my first try of a marmalade). For the to-go trip, the beef was not nearly as tasty. It was disappointing since I had talked up my first experience. I will definitely try it again but there are cheaper, tastier places to get burgers in town.  There are many different types of tables that you could be seated at and there is both indoor and outdoor seating. The seating runs into similar issues as it did when this location was Hotel Charlotte, it can get a bit cramped. The two-tops don't provide a lot of space for food and drinks if you do more than 1 drink/entree per person. If you plan to move along the bar, you'll have to do some scooting and maneuvering if parties are seated at the tables nearby.",

Everything looked amazing on the menu but as a table of 12, me and 4 of my gfs decided to share the dinner meal of fried chicken (2 pieces of each meat part and comes with two large sides) for $40. The fried chicken itself was great! Not the best I ever had chicken, but eating it didn't make me instantly fall asleep. I look for the amount of oil left in the chicken, the crispiness of the outside and how it stayed together to ensure maximum juiciness. As sides, we got mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, cheese grits, fries and mac n cheese. My friend got an appetizer of the buffalo chicken nachos which were dank!! My only concern was that it took so long to get us our food (one hour and 15 minutes to be exact). We may have been a big party but there were other big parties as well. We couldn't ask the waitress how long our food would take since she didn't come by much until after the food came out.  Regardless.... if you have an out-of-towner, bring them here. This place is screams homegrown Charlotte! Love it.",

It does get really crowded at dinner time at both locations, but they take reservations or you can plan to get there earlier. Their drinks are on POINT. I've tasted lots of different ones and I can't complain about any. They did take their Leroy Lemonade off the menu which was my favorite, hence 4 stars.   Their food is delicious and so filling. Everything has a little bit of spice to it though so if you don't like spicy, be careful what you order. Even the fries zucchini app has a kick to it.

With me already being home I figured it's too late.  I am not mad, or anything for the food was good.

I had a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich and was met with a relatively mild experience. There was no signature flavor, no stand out seasoning, just basic generic buffalo sauce on grilled chicken, slice of cheese, lettuce with a store bought bun. This place is styled in a way that makes me expect some sort of chef twist to the food. Maybe I'm being too hard on this sandwich, it met all the requirements after all.   The mashed potatoes on the side saved my experience. I should have ordered a few bowls of that alone. So good....so good.",

The Young George Washington and the Queen City Stoplight are a tasty rendition of an overpriced cocktail ( I do not believe on an Earth with $12 craft drinks, they should be more like $10).  The Cotswold location has a private dining option for celebrations ( I would only recommend the space accommodating 10-12 adults comfortably).  The parking options are not grand at all to meet the demand of their shopping center. They could benefit in investing in valet and having the cars parked in one of the businesses lining Sharon Rd.",

It was a foreshadowing of the rest of our experience. This was especially frustrating because it was Game Day...Panthers hosting the Buccaneers. Entertaining friends from out of town. No lie, it took us 45 minutes to get our food for a party of 4. We were there at 11am and it wasn't even that crowded. By the time we left, we missed the kick off and the first TD.  I had the eggs benedict which was just OK. Ask me if I ever got the refill on the coffee?  So many other choices, take another one.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! I often end up back here whenever I'm visiting - it's simple, convenient and serves up delicious chicken.   Food: I HAVE to start every meal here with the pretzel bites - the honey mustard and queso sauces are the perfect compliment to truly perfect, pillowy bites of pretzel bread. I also highly recommend the wings. They are fresh and never frozen, which makes a huge difference (and comes with a price tag). For my main, the pimento & egg sandwich is fabulous if you're super hungry and not worried about your cholesterol. Any of the chicken dishes are good as well: fried chicken, chicken lizzies, fried chicken salad, etc. For your sides I would go with Brussels (something green!) or mashed potatoes.   Drinks: Don't get me wrong, the cocktails here are good (shout out to the Russian ruby rose and cucumber basil lemonade). But they are definitely pricey for this area of Charlotte. It's always weird for me when my cocktail is more expensive than my whole food order. The beer menu is extensive and a little more budget-friendly.   Atmosphere/Service: The interior restaurant space is large with patio space, so there's usually tables available for walk-ins. There's also a side room available for rental for large dinner/lunch parties. I've always been a huge fan of the wall of street names here - it's definitely fun to look at if you're a Charlottean. The fox theme is cute without being too in-your-face. I've always had pretty good servers here, so I'd say service is adequate. Parking can be tricky during peak hours because it's a shared lot.",

We were seated at a cute high top table and our friendly waitress came over right away for our drink order.  On Sundays they have $4 mimosa specials which is a good weekend deal in charlotte.  We each ordered a mimosa and ordered the blackened shrimp wrap with our drink order.   Our drinks came out promptly along with some waters.  We then waited a long time for our food after we got our drinks.  We said multiple times where is our food?  This is taking forever.  When the food came out it was all really good and fixed perfect, but we had to wait too long for our food.  I would come back if I'm wanting to sip a couple of mimosas and I don't mind a long wait.",

The fried chicken here is excellent, different than others in Charlotte.  It is not as breaded, but sill has an excellent taste.  It was very very affordable to eat the fried chicken dinner as it came with two sides and a biscuit.  You left full, but not super full dreading the walk to the car because you can't even move.  For sides, I recommend the sweet potatoe tots (MUST) and the zucchini fries.  The Mac n cheese is good, but not as thick as others.  Just depends on your type.",

My New Years Resolution was to try new restaurants in the Charlotte area. Great resolution right? I decided to explore the menu before arriving, thank goodness! The weather was super nasty! I arrive thirty minutes late to brunch! UGH! Thankfully, my friend made a reservation for eleven people. The staff was both accommodating and patient with us. First order of business, Mimosas! Which are four bucks on Sunday's. Winning!!!   I choose the Chicken & Waffles. This was served with a peach compote, over-easy egg, and a Belgian waffle. The chicken was fried to perfection and seasoned perfectly!! The Peach compote was soggy and unnecessary, and the egg.....was not over easy. Of course, I ate the chicken and the waffle, duh! I left the peach compote and egg on the dish.  I selected the Mac & Cheese as my side item. The breadcrumbs were a perfect addition!    So will I come here again? Yes. I'm interested in trying the crab cake benedict and french toast with cannoli cream.    FYI, I would highly advise arriving early or make a reservation for a good seat.",

Went in between Lunch and Dinner yesterday, which was a Sat and got right in.  Had a nice waitress, who explained the menu. I ordered the Chicken Fried Sandwich. It was a huge piece of white meat of chicken, fried with a delicious batter on a reg bun. I got the most delicious little Sweet Potato Tots! They were sprinkled with Cinnamon sugar! We also had the Fried Zucchini for an Appetizer. Huge slices, but fried crispy and crunchy. My sandwich did come with a side of sausage gravy, which was filled with sausage. I had to ask for some mayonnaise, the sandwich was just plain on the bun. But it really was a GREAT piece of Fried Chicken! I will also recommend this establishment for their Chicken..go and try it!",

I came with a pretty large group, it was about 15 of us and the staff was accommodating and very kind. We were in the room right by the front door, which worked out great. It gave us just enough privacy to really enjoy our time there. Tip! If you're looking for a cool place to host a brunch or dinner (check them out).   I started with the mimosa, it was quite tasty. For my meal, I ordered the chicken biscuit with scrambled eggs and sausage gravy. The sausage gravy was not quite what I expected. I wouldn't order it again.   But the chicken was well seasoned and nice a hot when it arrived. I can definitely see why that's a restaurant favorite! I was also able to sample the chicken and waffles, hash brown casserole and sweet potato tots. All of which I recommend.   I'm looking forward to giving them a try again and sampling their lunch or dinner items. For now, they are A-OK in my book.",

They had the duke versus kanas game on and there were several families present. I was greeted no reservation needed and soon seated. They got my drink order to me quick but after that it it got a bit slow. I had the bourbon themed drink it was wonderful. They have good bar bites and nice place to relax. They have a small section in the front where you can do a small private party or gathering. I had the chicken wrap with the honey mustard on the side and it was pleasant. A friend of mine ordered the fried chicken and felt it was too salty. They have sweet potato tots which is very different. We also had the wings no sausage fried hard and they were okay. I would recommend. It's a casual setting with easy crowd.",

Turns out every place we wanted to try was closed, womp womp. We came in to LF around 2pm, place was quiet but it was Monday. After tasting our food my friend said, \"why are they not slammed?\" It's //that// good. I ordered the tenders and fries, she ordered the fried chicken on the bone with gravy, mac and cheese and green bean casserole. I will say not a single bite was left behind on my plate. I know what you're thinking, \"it's just chicken tenders and fries, how good could it be...?\" It was //that// good. I don't know if their sauces are made in house but the honey mustard is a must. If it's not made in house then I need to know what brand it is so I can hoard it at home. My friend was also raving about her plate; I dipped my fries in her mac and cheese sauce.. oooh! By dipped I mean to say I scraped the cast iron pan clean. I will definitely be back!  p.s. Don't skimp and skip the cocktails. The blueberry smash tastes like summer in a glass.",

The Brussels seemed over cooked and it was like chewing bubblegum. The salmon was just ok. I did like the $4 mimosas! I sampled my friend's green bean casserole and it was also just ok. My other friend's mashed potatoes came out cold so he didn't eat them. My friend said her black bean burger wasn't great either and she could only eat it with ranch.

It took a long time to get served and we never had the same person serving us through the entire night. The only thing we really like here are the zucchini fries. The chicken is way over priced and not better than you'd find at publix. We also tried the nachos, they were decent at best. The sweet potato tots are good too, but I'm pretty sure they just fry those from a frozen bag.",

    "text": "Eat here. Do it. Dooooo it. Big fan of Leroy Fox in Cotswold. Stopped in here a few times now. And always excited when I do. Out front is a covered patio, perfect for any summer weather since there's plenty of shade. Only downside is small patio so I always have my fingers crossed I can eat or drink outside but have yet to do so... next time I venture to Cotswold, I'm going to awkwardly stare at patio tables til someone gets uncomfortable, leaves and I can jack their table... you've been warned. But the inside is relaxing - cool, laid back vibe with a long bar and a front area decked out with couches for your lounging pleasure.  The menu is sensational with southern-inspired entrees scattered throughout. Last time I stopped in, my date and I posted up at a table and started with the zucchini fries. Whoa. Very good. The fried coating around the zucchini rods was seasoned perfectly. And out app was served with boom boom sauce, a orangish dip with a slight kick. Perfecto. Believe these fries would also rock with a side of sour cream.  Next I opted for the grilled chicken club. Fresh ingredients and drizzled with a sweet honey mustard. Light dinner choice (if you're starving I wouldn't advise it) which is exactly what I wanted. And I snagged the mac and cheese as a side.  I saw a list of drink specials for every day of the week, which I love when specials are valid on the weekends as well, yet I chose just to stick to a refreshing Angry Orchard.  Already decided my next meal there will be the honey buffalo sandwich, topped with blue cheese crumbles and sweet green tomatoes... you got to know a place is good when I already have my next meal planned out!",

    "text": "I'm glad they opened this place up in Cotswold - a neighborhood joint with plenty of TV's and a decent menu.  Because I'm adamantly opposed to Eddie's Place (in the same shopping center) Leroy Fox is a decent alternative.  I like the decor - kind of trendy, southern comfort, hipster.  Sort of looks like pottery barn barfed all over the entry way.  The little outdoor area will be nice in the spring - if you like looking at parking lot views - but it'll be brutal come July.    The food was good, not great.  I had the shrimp po-boy with shoestring fries, the wife tried the chicken fried chicken, and my son had a the chicken fingers and grits.  The fries were great, the shrimp was cooked well, seasoned decently, and overall was a decent sandwich.  The verdict on taste was that the food was decent.  Better than bar-food, but certainly no gastro-pub.    The one take-away from the food?  PORTION SIZE - holy meatballs batman.  Seriously, you're not leaving hungry.  I'd be surprised if this place turns a profit knowing how large each of the meals was.  Each plate was enough food to feed at least two people - including my sandwich plate!  It's not an exceptional value type place, I have to say.  The three of us (considering my son is 15 months old) dropped about $45 for lunch - with no alcohol.  I'd much rather get a smaller portion for $3-$4 less a plate.  I'd probably come back again for lunch, but will certainly keep in mind the portion size and look to see if I can order of the kids menu.",

For a side, I tried the zucchini fries.  They were recommended and well worth it.  The rest of the menu looked good.  But I can't wait to go back for more fried chicken!  Outstanding!",

The food is not your typical bar food. It has a definite Southern theme and the fried items are, unfortunately for my waistline, their strength. Fried chicken and fried zucchini border greatness. The staff is always very good too. It can get a little loud and the patio is sorta weird because it is basiclaly in the parking lot with a wall in between. Sometimes its crowded and sometimes its wide open. We have gone on Friday nights and had our choice of tables with zero wait, and we have also had to wait on a Wednesday. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the parking is a pain and the patio is not the best. But if you want a bar and grill and want to step off the beaten path, this place rocks.",

What I found on last Sunday early evening  was  sadly that I should have waited longer. Let me explain#1 My date and I went early enough to have some time before the busy time to talk and enjoy the Sunday at a new place to eat. When the server came to take our drink order I had told her that it was our first time and needed her help around the drinks and food... She offered a starter that we ordered when it came we found it was so really over coated w/batter that it was a pile of batter on a plate that she took away.  She then by that time had come by 3/4 times asking too many questions about what we had in mind to eat...Isn't that alot?  When knowing we had never been there before and were in deep conversation each time..It didn't seem to matter to her as we could see on her face as she walked away. ..We did order main dishes ,2 of the same and they came cold .  And with food still on the plates she again and came back 2 more times to ask if we wanted more food ......No we wanted to finish our food and conversation w/o her there with us .I don't think I have ever had that much inter-action with a server anywhere........ It was a Sunday early night meal ,not a Friday or Sat date night w/a packed house...... I ask that this be looked into and hopefully this does not happen to others.. I ask that this be a learning tool........ It does look very nice and that seems to be the best I can say.",

The Gatsby themed drinks were really good. These things are why I rated it the two stars that I did. The food however, was terrible. I was expecting something reminiscent of what their menu looked like online but I was wrong. To start off with they brought us our shared appetizer plate which consisted of 4 small stuffed button mushrooms were cold, 4 deviled eggs which were alright but nothing to brag about, and some crudites.. which was 4 cherry tomstoes, a few slivers of red pepper and some dry Brocolli. The next thing brought out was our choice of appetizer. Everyone got the pigs in a blanket and I got the oysters. Both were pretty good in my opinion. Then the Waldorf salad came out; it was soggy and weird. After that we were planning on where we were going to go after the main course because we were sure it would be disappointing.. We were right. I got sea bass with truffled risotto and it was down right terrible. I still want to give the restaurant a chance when there isn't another event solely because all the prior reviews",

My husband ordered the $22 pork chop with Mac n cheese, and baked potato.  The pork chop was tiny, maybe 6 oz which is absurd for a $22 entree, and it was over cooked.  The mac n cheese was bland and watered down.  Both of entrees were like warm, not hot and fresh.  My fried chicken was good.  In addition, all kids meals are $7, and again, small portions, just 2 small chicken tenders.  I rarely complain about portion sizes, but when the portions don't justify the prices, I have an issue.  Overall not a do over and a waste of money.",

My suggestion is to head a few doors down to Eddie's, different atmosphere and food but way more worth your time.",

The bacon was crisp and not too hard to bite into. The fried egg on the sandwich was perfect. Not runny or messy. Just right. There was an orange sauce there as well. No clue what that was, but it complimented the other ingredients very well.  My waiter was very kind and had personality. Not cut and dry like most dine-in restaurants these days. He checked on me to make sure everything was good every few minutes without making It seem like he was forced to do so.  I also had the Delirium Tremens beer and it complimented what I had very well. It was a light beer, possibly the best light beer I've ever had with a slightly sweet taste with a nice kick behind it.   Lastly, I had a brownie dessert that included a light brown brownie with chocolate chips, ice cream, caramel, chocolate drizzle and whipped cream. It was absolutely one of the best desserts I've ever had.   All together, it's a very warm environment with charm and you can tell they have standards for their upkeep as well as their food. My waiter made the experience one I'd come back for. I'm big on people, and you can tell at least from my experience that they have at least one great guy on deck. Go there!",

    "text": "Friendly service and plenty of space inside. It just gets crowded with the limited outdoor seating on nice days. Prices were fair and the chicken was a hit or miss.  We ordered the breast, leg, and thigh platter, and unfortunately, they gave us two thighs instead of a breast.  After informing the server, he immediately suggested to get us a breast piece, even though I told him not to worry. Once that piece arrived, it was freshly cooked, making it perfect and juicy.  However, a friend at the same table ordered the same thing, and afterwards said that his piece was too dry and needed extra hot sauce to liven it up. Dry breast meat is the worst, so hopefully you get a fresh piece.  Not sure if I'd gamble again on the chicken.  Will have to try some of their other dishes.  Also, we really enjoyed the sweet potato tots as probably the best thing to get off the sides menu.  An afterthought is their banana pudding.  For serving southern style fried chicken, their banana pudding was plain and the wafers were hard.  They need a better recipe for that.",

The chicken fried chicken was juicy and done to perfection. The macaroni and cheese might be the best I've ever had and the green bean casserole topped it all off. The Tollhouse cookie dessert didn't disappoint either. Warm, gooey, melt in your mouth delicious. Also, I'd highly recommend their cocktail selection. I had the blueberry smash!

    "text": "Went here with the wife tonight. Because of our schedules, we usually have dinner late (Late usually being around 10pm, sometimes later) I went to my trusty Yelp app to find \"late night\" restaurant options nearby and poof, found Leroy Fox.  Driven by this place a number of times, but never knew that it would be so cool inside. Upon reading a few reviews from friends it was \"Go time!\"  I really like the layout. Big tables. Very comfortable space in the dining room. You can sit at the bar, sit at big tables or booths. I know, that's just like everywhere. But this is different. It's cool. Trust me. The way it's set up if you're at a booth, you're not that close to the bar. So if you're on a date or something you won't have to be around too much rowdiness.   It felt like just the right amount of tvs in there too.Some places have too many tvs and it's almost distracting. They hit that perfect balance here.  There's also a very cool outdoor seating area. I can see myself coming back for evening drinks or happy hour or something. Very cool outdoor area with tvs.   Now onto the food and service.   The menu looked awesome and we were super excited to try some of the things on the menu. Then we were informed that because of the time we could only order from the late-night menu. It was kind of a bummer since obviously the late night menu isn't as comprehensive. We had to compromise from our first choices. But my wife enjoyed her chicken sandwich and pasta salad. My chicken tenders and fries were pretty solid too. I look forward to coming back and trying some of their other specialties.   The service wasn't bad. Our hostess got our drinks started and server took care of the rest. He was friendly and chill. He wasn't super attentive, but it was later in the night and things usually are slower. Overall the service was fine.  The prices were reasonable and they even have a cool selection of gifts/shirts, etc.I could see myself buying a shirt one day. LOL  In any event, I like this place a lot, Definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "Oh Leroy Fox, your zucchini fries stole my heart (or rather, my stomach) at first bite.  I can't say this place necessarily has a lot of healthy eats, but what they do have is some pretty tasty Southern cooking.  My partner and I have been here twice now for dinner.  Both nights we came, this place was PACKED.  The tables are pretty close together, making it a little difficult at times to navigate through this place.  Still, they have plenty of tables and a decent amount of space at the bar.  The decor is great, with nice earthy tones, dark wooden tables, and hanging lights.  The staff has been incredibly friendly and our food came out reasonably quickly.  Prices are very reasonable as well, with most of the dinners at $11-16.  It does tend to get a little loud in there when it's crowded, and don't even get my started about that tiny parking lot.  But don't let those things deter you.  Now, onto the food -  Fried chicken: I'm not  going to lie, it is pretty  amazing.  The batter is crispy and perfectly seasoned, and the chicken is moist and flavorful.  The second time I had it, it wasn't quite as good and was a whole lot spicier than the first time.  I imagine maybe it was an off day. (4.5/5)   Prohibited Burger: the patty itself was pretty good, and the meat tasted higher quality than standard beef.  The brioche bun was good as well.  I was quite excited about the concept of the bacon marmalade, but it ended up being a little too sweet for my taste.  I don't know why I'm surprised, since it IS marmalade.  Still, overall it wasn't bad, and if I'd been in the mood for that sort of thing, I might have liked it more.  (3.5/5)  Fannie Flag: I loved the batter, but the tomatoes were a little too vinegary for my taste.  The sweetness of them grew on me after a while, and I liked them with the boom boom sauce.  (3.5/5)  Zucchini Fries:  THE MOST AMAZING THING ON THIS MENU!!!!  These might be my favorite fried veggies anywhere.  The batter is very crisp and flavorful, and they are cooked so perfectly with just a little bit of crispness in the middle.  I could make a whole meal out of these.  (5/5)  Cheese grits:  Pretty good, and plenty of yummy cheese.  Not my favorite grits, but they're pretty solid.  (4/5)  Mac-n-cheese:  I give them mad props for having an original dish.  It's more like a parmesan and garlic macaroni dish, which was pretty good.  (4/5)  Toffee Tollhouse:  Really, can you go wrong with a big cookie topped with ice cream?  Definitely not here!  I loved the blondie, which was soft and buttery delicious.  The caramel drizzle was a perfect addition.  (4.5/5)  J.D.'s bread pudding:  After it cooled a few minutes, I really enjoyed it.  It had a great balance of sweetness and I loved the sauce.  (4/5)  I can see myself coming here pretty often.  I'm so glad to have great Southern cooking close to my neighborhood.",

Umm..well...   Evan:  No, what is its name?  What is on rotation this month?   Server:  No, that's the name, it's called \"Sugar Creek Rotation\"!!    Evan:  Really (and at this time I was questioning myself for a minute...)?? Typically when you see the word \"rotation\" next to a beer it's to indicate that the draft selection is on rotation with that particular brewery. You know like seasonal beer?.   Server:  No, not this one.  This is its name.  Sugar Creek Rotation.     Evan:  Interesting, so what is the OMB Rotation below it??     Server:  OMB, well that's Olde Mecklenburg Brewery.     Evan:  I know what OMB is, but it appears that you have a rotational draft with OMB too or is it coincidence that OMB and Sugar Creek both have a beer called \"rotation\"?    Server:  Yeah, that is weird.     Evan:  So weird. So to be safe, I'll just have the Sugar Creek Pale Ale please.  And a water.     Water never came, but at least the food was good.  Will probably not go back and will only consider Leroy Fox as a carry-out option only in the future.",

The patio is a really cool atmosphere and it's neat that they have big screens mounted outside. We had the Zucchini fries and they were awesome! The eggs Benedict was also great and I liked that they used chuck Taylor roll instead of Canadian bacon to give it a little twist. The cucumber tomato salad was pretty good as well. The service was friendly but extremely slow. They didn't refill our drinks until we hunted them down. Not as attentive as I would like. Overall solid spot and I will be back next time I venture over that way!",

    "text": "What can I say that hasn't already been said about Leroy Fox... Being a Cotswold resident, LF has become my local watering hole. It's also the only venue that I'll suggest for a \"first Tinder date\" (because the drinks are strong, and I know all exit routes, just in case...).   I've been to Leroy Fox for probably every type of dining or drinking experience possible... casual post-work happy hours, formal events, sit down dinners, business meetings, and the like. My favorite aspect of Leroy Fox is that it features an inviting, casual ambiance with a swagger that prevents it from feeling like a dive bar. It's the perfect blend of \"business\" and \"party\".   I've seen the same bartenders slinging drinks for years which is always a testament to them being paid and treated fairly. I am a stickler for Wednesday Sangria night, or trying a new cold beer on tap for Draft Night.  In addition to being a great place to get drinks, the food is sublime. Whoever thought of \"fried zucchini fries\" should be immortalized in a hall of fame. Those things are completely, utterly addictive. They even taste good the next day, if you've ever been guilty of ordering a full size portion, and get too tipsy off Copper to where you can't finish your food until you've sobered up the next morning (oops). Every single thing that I've consumed from LF has been delicious.  Give it a shot, get a spot on the patio on a warm summer night, and let's keep this place in business. Cotswold needs Leroy Fox to stay \"cool\" and \"hip\" in center city!!!",

    "text": "The dinner group had plans to visit Eddie's Place last night but Eddie's was jammed so we ended up here instead.  First off, it was half-price on specialty drinks but they were out of the Raspberry vodka for the Hotel Charlotte drink which is my first choice.  Bummer...so i opted for a second choice which probably wasn't as good.  It was a bit weak in the alcohol.  I guess 1/2 price means 1/2 the alcohol.  Some of the things we noticed as we were browsing the menu....This place is definitely southern with a lot of fried options...chicken and shrimp and zucchini to be exact.  Also, one of our group was on a restricted diet and couldn't do salt.  Your only salt-free options here are the salads.    Our table opted for the Zucchini fries as an appetizer and these were wonderful.  The trio of sauces were great especially the Boom Boom sauce.  Nice spice to it!  For my dinner, i ordered the Sweet Carolina Dip which contained Chicken slathered with that wonderful boom boom sauce and onions and served with chicken jus.   For a side, I ordered the mac n cheese.  The Sandwich was mostly bread which while tasty, I do like my sandwiches stuffed.  The mac n cheese was good and had a wonderful addition of pepper!  Desserts were ok...nothing special.  I had the toll house brownie which was quite rich but the ice cream cut the richness.  Service-wise, they were excellent.  For decor, the restaurant still has some of the old doors from the original Hotel Charlotte and I like that the drinks have local names.  The place was a bit loud between the music and the other patrons.  We were seated at a round table and I couldn't hear the person sitting across from me.  Overall, a decent place but with just a few flaws.",

I ordered a bloody mary and a shrimp po' boy.  My friend ordered a starter of pretzel bites.  The server said she didn't really like pretzels that much, but she loved these.  I hear ya sister.  When they arrived, they were little fried pretzel nuggets, with ranch, cheese dip and honey mustard for dipping.  I am a sucker for condiments.  Yay!!  Pretzels good.    My sandwich was a great size portion and the shrimp were fried and hot, my french fry barometer registered a \"wicky, wicky woooooow.\"  So I was happy, the one thing that I was not pleased with was my $10 dollar bloody mary was supposed to have a shrimp garnish, I didn't get the shrimp skewer, so I was hoping I had a $5 bloody mary, but I still had a $10 on my check, WAH!!!!  I hate $10 cocktails in the daylight.  Day drinkin' should be a bargain.    They do have really cute American Apparel t shirts, (with Vixen, sly fox and Leroy fox) you can pick one up for $20. And they are garnished with a shrimp skewer!",

My husband ordered a beer and it was just dumped in the glass by the waitress, which left a huge foamy head. But I can chalk that up to inexperienced service. I ordered the Caroline Dip with cheese grits for dinner. The grits were creamy and perfect. My sandwich was pretty good, too. My husband ordered fried chicken with mac n cheese. He really liked the mac n cheese and corn muffin, but the chicken was super salty. We ordered a toll house brownie dessert to go and waited a good 20 minutes for our check. The manager did remove the chicken and dessert from our bill, and maybe the waitress was just inexperienced or having an off night. I still tipped 20%. I will give Leroy Fox another try because overall the food was good and fairly priced.  Tip: The restaurant is very family friendly, casual, and sports-friendly. It'd be a good place to watch a Panthers game.",

    "text": "Food: I came here with a large group and started off with an assortment of pretzels/dips and fried green tomatoes. I wasn't a big fan of the pretzel dips but I did enjoy the novelty of the fried green tomatoes as I had never had them in my life. For my mail course I ordered the salmon filet with mac/cheese and seasonal vegetables. The salmon, veggies, and mac and cheese were all well cooked and not over/underdone, though I did feel hungry after the entree and thus ordered the berry tart w/ ice cream for dessert. I definitely enjoyed both my entree and dessert, but I wouldn't call them special in any way, except for the mac and cheese, which is more like \"coils and cheese\" which I definitely liked. It would take me too long to explain but I think a few patrons have posted pictures of the mac/cheese to illustrate that they use fancier pasta :-P.  Service: Because we were in such a large group, service took longer than expected for both the entree and dessert. That being said, they were very courteous, and I my water was refilled regularly.  Establishment: The establishment itself is PERFECT for sports fans. I came on a Sunday night and there were big-screen TVs everywhere with each of the NFL games on a different screen.  It was wonderful and if you hate your family, you can just stare at the TVs all night. It's also clean, comfortable, and great for groups. I didn't use their bathroom but it seems like the kind of place that would have a nice clean bathroom.  Conclusions: To summarize, this is a sports-bar + restaurant that makes simple, American food that won't wow you, but won't leave you disappointed.",

Food wise, I've gotten a couple different things and I've been happy with my selection every time. For appetizers, I'm a big fan of the Zucchini fries- lightly fried zucchini with Boom Boom sauce, which is a spicy creamy aioli type sauce. It's not great for takeout, but delicious at the restaurant. I also like their Fried Green Tomatoes, which has some sort of goat cheese in between in tomato which leaves a nice flavor variety with the saltiness of the fried tomato and the intensity of the goat cheese. Most of the time, I get the Elizabeth to eat, which is their chicken tenders with a side. If you like spicy, I highly recommend the Nashville style, which gives it a hot and spicy fried taste. I've been to Nashville and I would say that it's on par with what I've had there. The sides are great as well, the Cajun Fries and the Cheesy grits are my personal favorites. They have a large variety of sides which is much appreciated when you want something different.  The service is also pretty good. I have had some trips where it's a little slow, but overall the wait staff is friendly.  The only downside is that I wasn't overly impressed with their brunch, but I'll have to give it another try.  Great spot in Cotswold to enjoy some fried chicken!",

I highly recommend their \"world famous\" fried chicken.  The meat is juicy, the batter is perfectly seasoned and the portions are large.  Roll up your sleeves, ask for extra napkins and dig into some of the best fried chicken you've had with one of their awesome sides.  I love the green bean casserole.  If brunch is your thing, this needs to be your place.  Remember that fried chicken I spoke of?  It comes on top of a waffle.  Enough said.  There are other amazing options such as omelets and breakfast sandwiches as well.  The hashbrown casserole is slap-your-momma amazing.    The only thing I have had at Leroy Fox's that I didn't love was the sweet potato tots, as they are rolled in cinnamon and sugar.  But hey, that's personal preference.",

They don't open til 10:00, so I was a little bit gnawing my arm off, but it was worth it.  As we walked up, I noticed how cozy the outside patio looked. It was too cold to sit out there, but I made a mental note for a future trip. There are heaters around and a TV, and it looked like a nice place to hang out. Inside wasn't anything like what I expected, but I loved the old Hotel Charlotte doors with the bar that runs the length of the restaurant, and the booths that sit up a little bit with a window overlooking the tables.  I was hoping for a few lighter choices on the brunch menu (I know, I know), but I went with the make-your-own omelet. The fella noted that he's never seen me order an omelet - because I feel like the innards are never that great - but this one was decadent. I ordered ham, bacon, red peppers, and cheddar cheese, and I couldn't stop eating it! The fella got Which Came First (this place loves its chicken), and he loved it. The side of grits were good, but he said they needed just a smidgen more seasoning.  There were a few, tiny service mistakes - we got the dinner menus when we sat down, and we got two coffees and a water instead of two waters and a coffee - but our waitress was so apologetic and sweet that I didn't even mind.  By the time we left around 11:00, the place was hopping! This place may be off our beaten path, but I think we'll have to adjust our beaten path again pretty soon.",

The server took it back to the kitchen where they tried it and determined \"something definitely wasn't right.\"  The zucchini fries that were the BOMB had been changed--they were nice and thin, but this version came out, not as fries, but as large pieces of zucchini that had been dipped in batter, crunchy on the inside.  Such a disappointment.  One other suggestion:  since this is a family place and kids typically prefer blander food, they really should revamp the kid's chicken tenders.  WAAAAAY too much pepper and spice for most kids.    I'm so bummed.  This place is convenient and has potential a neighborhood go-to spot.  But they've got a LOT of kinks left to work out.",

The restaurant was very nice and it was good to see that they had incorporated parts of the old restaurant into the decor of the new restaurant.  The restaurant was packed solid.  The noise level was probably the most negative aspect of the experience.  In addition to the already deafening noise level, live music started up and it soon became impossible to hear the conversation at our table.  I had the \"north\" chicken which consisted of a breast and a wing.  It was fried and was quite good.  The chicken comes with a choice of a side item.  The menu looked quite good.  The service was also good, but I believe the kitchen got backed up with orders since the restaurant was full.  I wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant, if you have hopes of having normal conversation with the people at your table.",

    "text": "So, I guess I am a glutton for punishment.  Tried Leroy Fox again.  I have several issues -   1.  If you change your menu items but still hand out the old menu, at least have your waitstaff inform you when ordering of the change.  Hubster ordered the double breast dinner (he says breast always come in two - yeah right!) but when his dinner arrived there was only one.  We asked our waiter about it and he shrugged and said they were losing money on the two chicken breast dinner so now they only serve one breast.  That is fine but a heads-up would have been nice. 2.   If you advertise 1/2 priced wine on Mondays which has become the norm, you really should clarify that is by glass only.  We got all excited about the $30 wines on the menu (all wines are $30) that we could try for 1/2 price only to be informed the 1/2 price was only good for glasses, not the bottle.  Again, meh ok - kinda picky but whatever. 3.   The last issue is really not the fault of the restaurant.  Parents - the outside patio is not McDonald Land - don't let your kids run around on the patio so that waitstaff who are carrying glassware and hot plates have to dodge your rugrats.  Just because you choose to sit outside does not mean you don't keep your kids at their table.  I love kids but not when they are left on their own to find some source of entertainment while you sip your wine and converse with your friends.    Ok - enough venting.  Probably will not go back based on the lackluster menu - too much chicken - although zucchini is awesome.",

    "text": "Went on a Saturday afternoon. Food was great! I had the wings with mac n cheese. The mac and cheese was creamy with white cheese and the wings were fried and lathered with sauce just right!  Service was a tad slow considering there weren't a lot of people in there but still a delicious meal!! Also, you wouldn't know from the outside but the inside is very classy and appealing not your typical hole in the wall bar.",

    "text": "Leroy Fox (no relation!) is a recent addition to the Cotswold dining scene, occupying the space which previously housed Hotel Charlotte. The focus here is on chicken and from the above fried chicken salad, Leroy Fox has their chicken recipe spot-on. I also tried the shrimp wrap, which included chopped tiger shrimp and bacon. To me the bacon overpowered the shrimp a bit too much but it was delicious nevertheless and the zucchini fries are really something to try. For dessert I tried the tasty brownie sundae with ice cream - a great choice for sharing. I look forward to coming back soon for the whole pieces of fried chicken. Leroy Fox also offers a kids menu and a gluten free menu. They are open late, serve brunch on Sunday beginning at 10 AM, offer live music Thursday through Saturday nights and have wine, beer and cocktails including special brunch cocktails.",

    "text": "I just had one of the most disappointing meals in my 17 years living in Charlotte. To be fair, my family has gone to Leroy's every Sunday for the past four weeks so I could get their Shrimp Cobb Salad (with the shrimp blackened).  While a bit on the pricey side ($15), it's been something I have looked forward to as a way to end the weekend. Tonight, however, ruined it for me. Not only did my order come out incorrect (I have never sent a meal back in my life), but it took over 10 minutes to get someone's attention to point out the error. My entire family, who I insisted begin eating, were practically finished with their meals by the time I was able to point out the error. The server offered to bring out the shrimp cooked correctly, but at this point I just wanted to eat. The correct shrimp never found its way to our table. Again, to be fair, they didn't charge me for the salad but it didn't make up for such a poor experience. I still spent a great deal of money for the one appetizer and three entrees I bought for my wife and two kids, and I don't feel Leroy's did an adequate job of making such a poor experience right. The manager cleared our table so I voiced my frustration and let her we were regular patrons. While she was somewhat apologetic, I still don't feel we received the proper acknowledgement of the issue or poor dining experience.  It was so bad, I can say with confidence we have had our last meal at Leroy Fox's",

It was a Friday night so the place was pretty busy and noisy but the vibe was upbeat and exciting.  Everyone that ordered food raved about their dishes.  All and all two thumbs way up!  I can't wait for them to open the patio space out front!",

It was also the first time I have ever complained about food to a server.  Parts of the meal were fair.  The fries were inedible: chewy and cold.  I told the server and he said he would \"bring us a fresh batch\".  Never got them and no mention when he brought the check.  An $80 meal for 4...could have gotten better at nearby fast food and for much cheaper.  We will not be returning anytime soon.  Unfortunate since we live in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "We have been to Leroy Fox several times and our most recent visit was a couple nights ago.  We were seated quickly upon arrival and the server took our drink order right away. It was fairly crowded for a Tuesday night.  The place has a comfortable feel. There are booths, tables, and you can sit at the bar. Behind the bar are many TVs.  My wife and mother-in-law ordered the fried chicken.  I had the chicken fried steak and my son had the BBQ sandwich and my daughter had the mac and cheese. A couple, pieces of the fried chicken were not cooked thoroughly so we sent it back. Two entire meals were returned to us and they comped our desserts.  They handled the situation perfectly. Things can happen once in a while anywhere but the way it is handled is what counts the most and Leroy Fox knows customer service better than most. The food was very good. My daughter loves the mac and cheeses and my chicken steak was delicious.  The asparagus and fries are also good. The desserts were tasty too.  The food, service and ambiance are all reasons to return to the Fox.  It is a good value too.",

    "text": "Mixed bag for us tonight at Leroy Fox. I had the Po-Boy w/ zucchini fried, my wife had the North fired chicken w/ mac & cheese, my son had sliders w/ fries and my daughter had kids mac & cheese w/ fries.  Starter: shrimp cocktail - interesting take, shrimp was fat and incredibly good, well cooked and very slightly seasoned. The remoulade replacement for cocktail sauce was a tasty and clever and pleasant surprise: I really liked it.  Sliders - they were fine. Not newsworthy, but fine. Came with fries, and they're pretty good - crispy and tasty.  Mac & Cheese - the most boring mac & cheese I have ever tasted. Creamy, bland, a little overcooked. Just blah. Salt didn't fix it - the cheese was utterly flavorless. Fix that. How hard can mac & cheese be, people?  Chicken - like most popular fried chicken, it's always way too much about the sear and crunch, never enough about the flavor of the chicken. Look at it this way, chef: if I like it off the barbecue or out of the broiler, sans breading, it's well made and flavorful. Make flavor happen AND good breading, you win business. This chicken was as bland as the mac & cheese: Great breading and crunch, but yawn. My wife got the mac & cheese too. Oops. Strike two.  Po Boy - NICE! Shrimp was fresh, sweet, perfectly cooked, and flavorful (note - whatever you did to the shrimp, which was breaded and fried, do that to the chicken). Sauce was simple and lovely, not too spicy and oddly tart, maybe a little extra lemon. Bread was fine, Lettuce was fresh. Tomatoes were good. Too many onions, but hey: take e'm off. This was the winner of the night. Zucchini fries - also nice! Breading was again a winner, and the zucchini wasn't overcooked: it didn't snap, but it didn't squish. I rather liked it.  So: deep fried and breaded stuff with hit and miss flavors for whatever food was encased and featured. Presentation was mom's house, but I don't care. Room is a little tight and busy, and MAN is it noisy. Family land: great for kids and families in the early evening when we showed up. Service was clumsy and irregular but always extremely polite and eager to help. Price was a great surprise - seems very reasonable. No wasted time on 75 exotic beer selections: a couple popular crafts, the regular stuff, fair prices on mixed drinks - smart to focus on the cuisine, even though it needs some maturity. I need 125 beers to choose from I'll go to Taco Mac (and starve to death rather than eat the tripe they serve) or the Saucer.  So: grow up a little bit, cover your seasoning skills under the batter and be flexible, keep that oddball attitude among your staff (kinda like the Pizza Peel; friendly and aloof and always willing to make you happy) and this tight little room could be a serious contender for my money.",
