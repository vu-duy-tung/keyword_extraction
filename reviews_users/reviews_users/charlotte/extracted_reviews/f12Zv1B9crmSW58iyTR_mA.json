    "text": "This was my first time trying out Midwood Smokehouse.  I'm a huge fan of North Carolina BBQ with the eastern NC vinegar based sauce.  Service was great. I was seated quickly. The waitress asked if it was my first time visiting and went into detail about how they are known for their brisket, that they make all of their own sauces and dressings from scratch, and they have a special smoker.  It was a Tuesday night so they also had a $3 special on all NC beers.  I will say their drink menu was lacking and confusing.  Instead of naming the specific beers they were on tap, it just named the breweries that they had beers from. We all know there are lots of breweries in charlotte with a wide selection of choices.  It would have been beneficial to be able to see which specific beer they were serving from that brewery and a description. (Not everyone is super familiar with what each local beer brewed is) I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of coleslaw. You had a choice of which type of cheese you could put on your sandwich and I chose the pimento. You couldn't even taste the pimento cheese on the sandwich.  It was my first time trying brisket and I won't be trying it again. It was served on a basic piece of toast.  I only ate half the sandwich because it really was disappointing.  The coleslaw was terrible. I really had high hopes for this restaurant and would like to go back and try something else but I just don't know if I will since there are other BBQ places I have already tried that I know are better. I will say the waitress was fantastic and the food was served promptly. If I go back and try something else I will update my review. Until then, I wouldn't recommend this place.",

    "text": "Am pretty pleased with this place.  They have beef brisket...hard to find in the land of pork.  The pork is also very good.  It is always crowded so avoid prime times for coming here.  And it is loud and busy.  If you have a senior with a walker or wheelchair they can accommodate, but it really gets in their way and to their credit the staff work around it.  I like their appetizers which include jalapenos stuffed with cheese and fried.  We had an order and they just were not cooked well.  Told the wait person and very quickly the manager came to deliver a fresh, perfectly made order to our table.  THAT is excellent customer service and satisfaction.  You can order mixed portions of meats and can also select fatty or lean brisket.  Or a mix of the two.    They really do aim to please.    97 year old Dad likes their mac & cheese and we found the staff more than willing to customize portions and selections for him rather than just stick to what the menu dictates.  Parking is also crowded, but somehow the lot outside does accommodate.  This is a good BBQ joint.",

Shaved beef brisket with a patty (medium well for me), gouda cheese, some type of Chipotle sauce I can't remember, banana peppers, and a lot more. Right when it was put in front of me you could just smell it and it tasted even better than it smelled. I've also had some of their meats, sausage, ribs, just about all of them and I can't complain about any of them. Hush puppies are amazing, Mac and cheese is amazing, baked beans amazing. Oh and did I mention the BBQ sauces? Those are... amazing!",

    "text": "We got so much food here. It's a good spot for bbq, and worth trying if you're in the area.  Bacon wrapped Jalapenos - So I'm probably not the target demographic for this since I hate cheese and bacon, but I think if I liked those two items, I probably would have liked this.  Smoked wings - I liked the smoked version better than the crispy version. Actually had a nice smokey flavor. Although I'd probably skip the wings in favor of some of the other bbq options.  Burnt Ends - I wasn't the biggest fans of these, but some others in my party loved them. I guess it just depends on if you like this kind of stuff. I was honestly expecting it to be more crispy, but I've never had burnt ends before, so no point of comparison. Also not a huge fan of BBQ sauce in general, which was the main flavor component for this dish.  St Louis Style Pork Ribs - THESE WERE SO GOOD. Very tender and flavorful. You have to get this.  Beef Brisket - I thought that this was okay, but not spectacular.   Carolina Pork - I really liked this too, very flavorful and tender.   Hickory Smoked Sausage - Not bad, although I feel like ribs are just always going to be better than sausage.   The hush puppies and pickled onions were also great accompaniments to the meat. We got a couple of side dishes, and I quite liked the smoked veggies (although they were a bit too oily for me). The banana pudding was also quite good, though very rich. All in all, enjoyed the meal here, and I think I prefer it to City Barbecue, solely on the strength of its ribs and Carolina Pork (although admittedly they are different styles).",

    "text": "Let's be honest - I have only had the brisket and the burnt ends. But they keep me full, happy, and coming back for more.  This Ballantyne location has done very well. The staff is friendly, the food is hot and consistently good. The mac and cheese is amazing too - some days I could just get a whole plate of that and fade happily into a food coma.   The restaurant is set up with a bar towards the front, so you don't feel awkward buzzing past the host stand to get to the bar. There are tables and booths everywhere, and they even have a little patio outside. They've made this into a very comfortable, casual place to come and have dinner. You could come with the family, or grab drinks with a date. You could even take food to go - but I guess that depends on how the date is going - haha!  I had friends in town from PA, and we saw the burnt ends on the list of \"50 things to eat in Charlotte before you die\". They weren't kidding. These are incredibly good - and most of their food pairs beautifully with the NC craft beers that they have on draught. Eventually I think I'll branch out to the other food items on the menu, but for now these choices are plenty.",

When I told them that my ribs were cold they didn't offer to warm them, instead  they said that the air conditioner vent above me was the reason for the cold ribs!  Cocktail refills were hard to get.  They used standard lip service to talk away the conerns rather than taking action to cure.  The manager took our glass for a wine refill and literally 10 minutes later returned with a refill.  He offered it for free because he reolised the failure in proper service.  The food tasted great.  Their service left a bad taste.  We took the ribs to go.  Went elsewhere for dessert and drinks.",

    "text": "Why can't half stars be implemented? This place seriously deserve 4.5 stars but I can't give it a 5. Here's why. I've been a big fan of Mac's speed shop and I heard this place rivals Mac's and so I had to try it out. Luckily, Midwood opened a location right next to my house (yes!) so it makes commuting so much easier.  Once we walked in, we noticed how the whole restaurant is decked out with televisions. It seems like a nice place to watch the game and grab some grub. But for a Sunday night, the joint seems pretty dead. The place was only about a quarter full but I attributed that to it being a newer location. Now onward to the food:  We ordered the pimento cheese fries loaded with beef brisket and smoked wings as starters. The wings were ok but the cheese fries? Oh man, it was really good. It had the right amount of melted cheese and a generous amount of smokey brisket bits on top. The serving portion was also a lot bigger than we thought and so we already started to get a bit full before our entrees arrived. For our entrees we ordered the burnt ends with smoked veggies and a combo platter. Let me break it down for you:  The goodies: Burnt ends: the star of the night. Not many places do burnt ends (or in this case make it right) and it had the right amount of crispness on the outside and tenderness in the inside. It even got my Chinese family of 6 (that are not fans of American barbecue) fighting for that last piece.  Carolina chopped pork: moister and more tender than most BBQ joints Mac & cheese: well it's hard to mess up Mac & cheese and they definitely did not. The flavors were spot on but I wished it was a bit hotter. Bacon wrapped jalapenos: hot and spicy. Just the way I like it.  The not so goodies: Beef brisket: it was just alright but could be more tender, juicer than even a bit fattier. I thought their brisket was too lean to get that smokey flavor that brisket tends to have. St. Louis pork ribs: I've been spoiled with some good ribs and these were just alright. With the right dipping sauce they became enjoyable. Chopped chicken BBQ: too dried for my taste. I wish they offered a whole piece of chicken on the combo plate instead of shredded.  We also ordered the banana pudding and it was really good. I liked how they used actual cake bits instead of just wafers. However, the star of the show was definitely the burnt ends and that by itself made my night. I would definitely return just to order a whole large plate of burnt ends for myself alongside their vast amount of draft beers on tap.",

But twice now, I have ordered food for a party, and both times the beef brisket was so fatty that guests barely ate it. NOT what you want to have happen when feeding 25 people. NOT worth $18/ pound, when it's 50% fat. The 1st time, I assumed it was a one time bad batch. But this 2nd time causes me to think that the restaurant willingly buys and serves very fatty beef brisket, at least for bulk/catering orders. Not cool.",

The first bad experience the waitress charged my card for more than what was specified and did who knows what with the cash we gave her to go towards the bill. It took 3-4 calls to get a manager to assist me they refunded me the difference but didn't seem that concerned. I just recently visited this past Sunday and was so disappointed. When i ordered my drink it was watered down from where the tea was still warm. This caused it also to be unsweet. My waiter didnt come to check on me as I had just received my meal but couldnt eat it without a beverage. I had to ask the person bringing out drinks to help me. Because of this my food was cold. The waiter had 3-4 tables at the most so I wouldnt expect such horrible service. When i was ready to leave and asked to take my leftover meal home I was given random containers to pack it up on my own. Then when I gave the waiter cash for the bill and told him I would need change. He didnt come back with it and was trying to send me on my way. I had to let him know about the miscommunication which he didnt seem so happy about. I've taken many people out to dinner at this location but really not sure if I want to go back. I left disappointed.",

I started off with the bacon wrapped jalapenos today and the bacon tasted a bit old, which is not normal for what I am used to at Midwood.  I also order the TX Brisket sandwich with the Philly-style Mac and Cheese, which also happened to be the day's special.  The Brisket sandwich was spectacular, but the Mac and cheese was basically a few peppers and a couple pieces of brisket slapped on top of Mac and Cheese... definitely not worth the $5 upgrade to the premium side.  The service was excellent and I will continue to go to Midwood as my 'goto' for BBQ in the Ballantyne area.",

Winner was the brisket by a landslide.  Moist tender flavorful and oh so delicious.  Burnt ends were a mixed bag of dry but flavorful and moist and flavorful.  Ribs were a little dry and tough but still good. then the pull pork, its ok, its pork strips with a vinegar dressing.  We had it as 'take out' so it wasn't all their fault.  The sides were smoked veggies (meh), sweet potato fries (crunchy and good even when cold), cream corn (good), bbq cole slaw (tasted like minces cabbage in watered down pull pork dressing), bbq beans (good and tasty), mac and cheese (good).  I would go here again but would try the famous one on Central Avenue.   i guess next time when we drive 700 miles again to see my bro in law.  by the way Charlotte, NC is beautiful.",

My wife ordered the ribs, I ordered pulled pork. The food arrived promptly, but, unfortunately it was not particularly outstanding. The portions were generous, but my fries were limp and greasy, pulled pork was good. My wife's ribs were dry and not very \"meaty\". We found out later that if you want the \"meaty\" ribs you have to pay double! Really? The couple next to us found this out the hard way when they received their bill, which was over $30.00 for a rib dinner. While our dinner was ok, I doubt we will return, there are better choices available. I don't know, maybe it's the building they are in. Sticky Fingers closed because it went downhill in quality, hope Midwood Barbecue has better luck. They will have to improve greatly to ever get me to return.",

    "text": "We love the original Midwood location, so we were pumped when this location opened up. We finally made it in for dinner, and I was so pleasantly surprised that the new location was just as great as we were hoping for. My boyfriend always gets a dish called the \"Pig Out\" where you can select a variety of the barbeque and also get a few sides. I usually trust the creative genius and go with the special. Very rarely, I'll opt out of the special and go with a loaded grilled cheese sandwich. SOOOOO good.  A few tips: 1. If you're going in on a busy shift, try using the app called No Wait. It allows you to get in line without actually being at the restaurant and will wait for you. Our favorite restaurants use it, and it has saved us from the crowded and hungry waiting scenario that everyone dreads. 2. Get the mac and cheese, then dip it in the Carolina style sauce. One of the servers at the Midwood location recommended it to me once, and I've never looked back. The bacon wrapped jalapenos are also delicious. I respect Midwood for leaving the heat in the jalapeno. If you don't like spicy, opt for the creamed corn instead. 3. If you're on a diet, save up for a cheat day. The fatty brisket will make you so happy you did. If you never take a day off, however, you can get your brisket lean.  4. Get over there as fast as you can! It's so so good.",

First visit was within a month of the opening and everything was great, food, service and atmosphere. my second visit was a month later was considerably different. Dined in, poor  service and received the wrong food order twice.not really a major problem because we were in no hurry and the waitress was new. But this third and last visit was today. Take-out order for myself and my brother who had never been there before  that take-out order was incomplete not once but twice.  Thank goodness we checked the order before we left. The manager was very responsive and tried to give us partial credit for our food order. We said no thanks just needed a complete order. The barbecue pork was greasy and very salty this time   macaroni cheese was delicious and the smoked chicken was tender  it is quite apparent that this location has a higher turnover of staffing based on my observation and service   Unfortunately this will be our last visit at this location. The other location is excellent food and wonderful service",

It was time to splurge since I don't come here often.   My group ordered two Pig Out Platters for the four of us.  Pig out comes with 4 proteins, 2 sides, hushpuppies, and pickled onions.   What we got:  Proteins:  - lean beef brisket: skip out on this and indulge in the fatty beef brisket because it's so worth it  - fatty beef brisket: so juicy, tender, and fatty. It literally melted in my mouth. My favorite!  - St. Louis Style pork ribs x2: fell off the bones, and super yummy!  - chopped pork: don't recommend. It was kind of dry and too smoky.  - hickory smoked sausage x2: Just okay, nothing out of this world.  - chopped chicken: Same as the chopped pork.  If I come here again, I would order 2 fatty beef brisket, pork ribs, and hickory smoked sausage. I also got the sauce on the side which was a good move because I don't like my bbq drenched in sauce!    Sides:  - Collard Greens: didn't try  - Smoked Veggies: surprisingly very good. My favorite side! This is a must!  - Classic mac & cheese: wish it was more cheesy  - Crinkle cut fries: wish it was more crunchy!  - hushpuppies: wow, so crunchy on the outside! SO GOOD.  - pickled onions: didn't try this because I dont like pickled stuff  It was quite a lot for us and we went home with leftovers.   Our waitress was really friendly! Great customer service.   Definitely a must when in Charlotte! Even Hillary Clinton & Obama thought so!!!",

To compare to my favorite place, I ordered similar items--beef brisket, collard greens and baked beans.  The plate also came with hush puppies. The portion was excellent, and don't leave hungry-good value for the food.  The brisket had a little fat, which made it moist, and good smoke.  They offer the BBQ sauces on the side - a vinegar base and tomato base sauce, I stayed with the tomato based sauce. Overall, the food was good, and the service was excellent! I've had their burnt ends before and thought they were excellent.  Some BBQ joints only offer the burnt ends as an appetizer, this place it's a meal with sides.

    "text": "We LOVE Midwood Smokehouse and have been to 3 locations.  We have visited this location a couple times.  I stand by my 5 star reviews with the main location and this one had the potential to be 5 stars as well, as the food has been top notch each time.  This location just has issues with service.  One time we we missing a side with a large to go order but we didn't realize until we got home.  Didn't do anything about it as it was just a side. Just worth mentioning now since there are issues with this location.  Last Friday we came here to send my brother in law off with his last bbq before he went overseas for awhile.  Midwood was busy and had a wait, no issue, but when we were called in we were a table of 3 put in a booth meant for 6-8 people it looks like.  Made it incredibly hard to have a decent conversation with how wide we were spread out!  We ordered drinks from the bar.  Wrong drink came for me but it was fixed.  This was because the server wasn't paying attention, I even said my drink twice because I don't think he got it, clearly he didn't.   Food came and was prompt.  Was great as always.  Loved the pork and burnt ends!  Always consistent.   But after we got the food, it just seemed like they were trying to get us out as quickly as possible.  Asking if we were done.  Nope not yet.  My husband and I were finally done and had ours boxed up.  Server came back with the box and asked the two of us if we wanted anything else.  No.  Then he tries to take my BIL's plate when he was still eating.  Then he comes back with the bill.  Okay BIL is still eating and just got a new beer.  What is he wants something else?  He eventually finishes his plate and then he starts on his beer.  Waiter tries to take the bill but there is nothing in it, plus my BIL and husband are still working on beers.  One of the hostesses comes by and takes our water cups.  Okay, I guess we are done here then.  We just decide to pay and go on our way since they probably needed that large table for a different group.  Either way, we are still customers and should not be pushed.  Fix your service and you could be 5 stars too!",

    "text": "Maybe it was an off day, but I have seen others say good things about the burnt ends here............. I have to say, I didnt agree with them too much. Mine were kind of dry and lacked flavor. Sucks because I need to find a good burnt end place in the area (I am new here). Now, I will praise the wing appetizer that we ordered. That was the best thing my group ate. The other items were decent (mac & cheese, hush puppies, bacon wrapped jalapeno), but the crispy wings were the move for me.We also tried the ribs (pretty good) and the 1/2 chicken entree (also pretty good).   I will try another spot for my burnt ends craving, but the wings are awesome.",

Our server, Melissa, outshined everything, even the food (which is darn near impossible in this spot.) She was so friendly, she brought us everything we didn't know we were gonna need and made spot on recommendations regarding the menu. Legit, even if the food wasn't great, I'd come back for her.  Luckily, the food is incredible and everything we ordered was unbelievable. Normally I would've driven to the Plaza Midwood location, but we were right around the corner and I am so glad we got a chance to check out this location because otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to meet Melissa!",

Add in alcohol and the adults can be equally just as much of pains. Thankfully our kickass server (Dylan) was able to maintain control. Although I do apologize again for our repeated spillings (by the adults).  I came in wanting to try everything. The only meat I didn't include in my order was the burnt ends. It'll have to wait till my next visit. As for everything else, we loved it. Jalapeno's wrapped in bacon were great. Also tried some fries with pork or brisket on them.. The ribs were delicious and fell right off the bone. Pulled pork was exactly how I like. The chicken was my least favorite but even that was good. Sides were what you would normally expect from a place like this.   If you haven't been to Midwood and you live in Charlotte, you are missing out.",

    "text": "(5/28/17) I felt like bbq tonight so my wife drove us over to Midwood. We got a trainee waitress Ally and her trainer who failed to introduce himself. I ordered bacon wrapped jalapenos. They had good flavor but no heat. The next course is nachos libre with brisket and an old Mecklenburg hornet's nest beer. My wife is getting chicken wings. The trainer, whose name was Trent but we found that out when we got the bill, had promised us BBQ sauce which was never given to us. He also recommended the excellent beer but had promised a glass of water as well that was never brought to the table. My wife asked me why I didn't remind them about the missing items. I told her that it wasn't up to me. The nachos were average at best. There was so little brisket that it was clumped in a thin strip down the center of the dish rather than spread throughout it. That was disappointing.  My wife had ordered the chicken wings on Trent's recommendation because he told her that they had switched suppliers and that the wings were larger than they had been previously. Apparently he didn't remember how small the previous wings were since my wife said that these wings looked like pigeon wings too. They were definitely the smallest wings I'd ever seen.  Well at least I have two less dishes that I will choose the next time that we eat here.",

The waitress asked if she was finished before she was finished. She then presented the check & had to take it back because my wife wanted the banana pudding.

Next the food: our server, Iimane, suggested the well-fed combo platter which includes your choice of 4 meats and 2 sides for $24. We chose the burnt ends ($2 extra), the brisket, pulled pork and chicken. For sides, the mac n cheese and the bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers. So, the burnt ends were delicious chunks of brisket bathed in BBQ sauce and they were tasty. The pork was lightly covered in vinegar sauce, white meat chicken comes plain so you can choose any of their 4-5 sauces. The mac n cheese is homemade and the poppers are hot and spicy, so good.  Service, food, music and atmosphere was all excellent so I highly recommend.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Norwood Smokehouse, and it will not be my last. Shantel was our server, and she was excellent. I decided to try a few new things: Burnt Ends (of bee brisket), Smoked Vegetables, and their Collard Greens. I can not properly describe how delicious the Burnt Ends are! I really could eat just them for the rest of my life and be eternally happy. The Smoked Vegetables did not disappoint -- yummy!  The Collard Greens were the way I like them as they did not contain too much vinegar; however, for those that enjoy more Shantel did offer me vinegar if I had wanted more. Everyone at the table was really pleased with their meals. Norwood Smokehouse is definitely on my local favorites list. Enjoy!",

The service was lackluster at best. Too many other really good places to eat BBQ to make a special trip here again, at least for us.",

    "text": "Ate there for the first time today. Out of ribs at 4pm but it was Father's Day, so it's understandable. On the waitresses recommendation, I ordered the supposedly one pound beef rib. When it arrived me and my wife both looked at each other saying that's one pound of meat. It was cooked right with good flavor but no where near a pound of beef. I made mention to the waitress and she kind of agreed with me. She said she mentioned it to the manager but nothing was taken off the bill. Oh, the meal price was $28.00 which if it was a full pound of meat would be worth it. My wife could not get ribs, so she ordered a burger which she said was good. I guess I should have ordered the burnt ends which I originally wanted. Not saying I will not return but you would think that first time customers with an issue would be comped in some way.....anyway, my dog is happy, he's currently chewing on the rib bone which probably made up close to 1/2 of the one pound weight.....",

Attentive service, friendly staff, hot and fresh food - overall a great experience.  We have been talking about going back and we're looking forward to making it a regular dining out spot.    Fast forward to today - 4th of July.  From the moment outer server came to the table, it was obvious she didn't want to be there.  Same went for management, food runners, etc.  By the time the meal came my husband and I felt like we didn't want to be there either.  Then the food... It was gross.  So apprentice the cooks didn't want to be there either.  We got a plate with 4 meats... The brisket was dry and lukewarm.  The pulled pork was also dry and cold.  The ribs were the only thing that came out hot besides the macaroni and cheese.  Our server didn't come to check on us, we flagged down a food runner to ask for some hot fries, the second set of fries also came back cold!    It's unfortunate that no one wanted to work today.  It has potential, as we loved our first visit.  But went downhill quickly.  Maybe a hot or miss depending on the day.",

However, the waitress handled it nicely and checked on me until I was ready. She made recommendations & answered any questions that I had. I ordered the Small plate of Chicken BBQ with Mac & Cheese. It came with Hush Puppies & Pickled Onions. I also ordered a side of Texas Toast. The chicken was really good. It was Tender & Flavorful without too much sauce. The Mac & Cheese was also surprisingly good for a restaurant. It was creamy and the top was layered with real cheese and they used seasoning/salt lol. A lot of restaurant Mac & Cheese is bland so I appreciate that. Hush Puppies were good, your average hush puppy. I also enjoyed the pickled onions. I can't really explain them but they were good. I ended up mixing them into my chicken. The Texas Toast was OK. I ordered it thinking I would need something to put my chicken on but I could have went without. It was buttered and toasted to a crisp (Not hard). I prefer my Texas toast to be a bit more soft. But it still wasn't bad. Decor wise it was ok. I'm not one to really notice the decor unless something about it bothers me. The only complaint I have is the booths are high with no foot rest. I felt like all the blood in my legs was rushing to my feet and got uncomfortable so I boxed most of my food to eat later. They do have a few tables but not many. I will be giving this place another try. I'd like to try the ribs, they looked delicious!",

    "text": "Midwood Smokehouse has excellent, 5 star fatty brisket and mostly good other items.   My family of 6 (5 adults + 1 kid) split a Pig Out combo platter, 2 tacos, and a few sides.   Pig Out Platter with...  - Brisket (fatty): Amazing! So flavorful, moist without being gross like I've had at other places. Probably the best I've had.  - St Louis Style Pork Ribs (dry): A lot of nice smoke flavor in the ribs. I liked them even better when I added sauce which is an option but my dad prefers dry.  - Carolina Chopped Pork: The weakest item in the platter. Texture was good, but the taste wasn't there.   - Hickory Smoked Sausage: Good, nice flavor and texture. The brisket and ribs were good enough that I wish we had just gotten 2x brisket and 2x ribs though!   Stockyard Tacos - Why order tacos at a BBQ place? I think the answer is, \"Don't let kids order anything.\" Somehow the addition of all the taco toppings made the brisket less interesting, not more.   Sides - Hush Puppies: I really liked these hush puppies. Nice crunch on the outside, soft inside, and buttery corn flavor. The only downer was how few we got. The platter came with hush puppies, and we also ordered a side of them, but we still only got about 9.  - Mac & Cheese: Not great. Dry without any strong cheese taste.  - BBQ Baked Beans: Really good! Hearty and meaty.  - Creamed Corn: I've never had this before so I can't really compare it to any other versions, but I liked it. Very rich.  - Collard Greens: They were collards... not much else to say. As good as others I've had.  - Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos: They tasted mostly of bacon. No taste of the peppers themselves or the cheese that was inside.  - Sweet potato fries: A very generous amount of fries. I love sweet potato fries and this was no exception.   The only other weak point to mention is that for a BBQ place, they're surprisingly stingy with the sauce. My whole family had to split 4 small containers of sauce (like takeout ketchup sized). It was busy so it was hard to get more. Even after asking mid-meal, we didn't get any more until our server came by to pack up our leftovers. I've mostly been to places where the containers are just on the table. If you like sauces, ask for more at the start.   Overall: delicious brisket, generous portions, and friendly service with a few minor issues. I'll definitely be back again the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

We really liked the food, but didn't like the layout of the Central location.   A few weeks after opening (and getting their liquor license) we stopped by on a Thursday afternoon to get dinner. The dining room had a wait so we sat at the bar. The bar staff works so hard to make all of the drinks and deliver food to the bar guests. We ordered the sampler platter which is 4 meats and 2 sides + hush puppies and pickled onions. In our experience we find that it is best to get the following: pulled pork, pulled pork (x2), ribs, and brisket (combo lean and fatty) along with another order of hush puppies, and macaroni and cheese. We would get another rib vs. another pulled pork however, it costs extra and we are cost efficient.   The ribs are so good, fall off the bone, doesn't need sauce kind of good. The brisket is so good, my husband, (who said he doesn't like brisked) ate his fair share. We got 2 orders of hush puppies because they are worth it. And the mac and cheese, which I am the queen of picky, was gone. Like poof, where did the macaroni go? Kind of gone.   This is also the perfect share with another meal. And they have OMB Copper. And they have BYOM (bring your own mug) night.   Go there. But don't take our seat at the bar.",

Also had the make your own salad which was awesome.  My daughter ordered collard greens which she said were better than mine and she loves my greens.  I told her that she ought to be glad that she was sitting so far away from me.  But, I have to say that they were good.  Not vinegary like some places.

You really can't make a bad choice. They are almost always busy but that doesn't seem to impact service or speed, so that's a big positive. We always bring guests here from out of town and while the ambiance of the one in Plaza Midwood is better, the burbs still love having their new location so close.   So why four stars instead of five? Seems silly, but they literally REFUSED to let me order from the kids menu. I'm not a big eater and was leaving town where leftovers would have been wasted, and the waitress told me no, it's against their policy. She \"asked\" the manager who also said no, something about the portions being the same size. I was with my husband and father in law, and if you serve children the size of portions they got, those are kids who probably don't order from the kids menu anyway.",

Order was as follows:  Sweet potato fries-cut approximately the size of shoestrings. Lightly salted and a nice mixture of crispy and softly cooked pieces. (I prefer the softly cooked.) There were several in my party, and everyone who sampled them enjoyed them.  Baked beans-flavorful with the tangy sweetness of bbq sauce, and small amounts of meat added in. Not sure what type of meat it was, but it was very tender.   Sweet creamed corn-corn had a nice smoky, peppery flavor, but the cream sauce seemed a little greasy, and the corn was undercooked.  Mac and Cheese-No flavor, just pasta with some cheddar cheese added in. Also had several overcooked bites.  Texas toast-Cost $1.00 extra, and they serve you 4 pieces. It was overcooked, almost to the point of being burnt.  I also received hush puppies with my order, and they were soft, chewy, with a little bit of sweetness, and very good.  Banana pudding-very good, and they serve you a fair amount. I would definitely return just for this!",

I ordered their $24 combo platter (because that is the most cost effective way to have two types of meats, they make you order FOUR and spend $24!). I only ate less than half of the food. It wasn't great tasting. THEN an hour later - let's just say I got SICK and spent the next hour in the bathroom. I'll NEVER be back!!!",

Then for entree I had the burnt ends with sweet potato fries.  Both were amazing.  The burnt ends were cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing.  The sweet potatoes were great too.  Then tried the banana pudding.  It was homemade and perfection.  Lastly Donnie was one the most amazing servers ever.  We may go back tomorrow!  I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Excellent BBQ...there's no other way to put it. The ribs were tender and didn't really even need sauce but I still had to try the house sauce and honey habanero. The latter hit you with a little sweet and then just enough heat to get a little sweat on your brow. The burnt ends that accompanied were caramelized in a Cheerwine sauce and were melt in your mouth tender. For my side I chose bacon wrapped jalapenos because why not. Another winner in my book. My wife had the Carolina pork plate with vinegar slaw and thoroughly enjoyed it. All meals come with hush puppies so honestly you only need the small plate which allows one side. The protein portions were large, everyone brought leftovers back to the hotel. We ended dinner on a sweet note with a small banana pudding and it was pretty solid. Not the best we've had, but it was pretty darn good. Service was excellent, drinks were never empty and our server checked back frequently to make sure we were taken care of. Everyone in our party was happy we chose Midwood and next time we are in town and wanting some BBQ, we will definitely stop back.",

There's a great bar, a large dining area, and every server we've ever had has been knowledgeable, helpful, attentive, and just the right amount of fun/playful.  Food, served on cute home-y dishes, is incredible. I alternate between the brisket and shredded BBQ. My husband will order nothing except for burnt ends because they're \"the best meat candy you could ever have.\" The sides are just as delicious. Bacon-wrapped jalapenos (a signature Midwood dish), mac-and-cheese, fries, and hushpuppies are a few of our favorites. The banana pudding is KILLER as well. I've truly never been disappointed with anything I've ever had at Midwood. The meal can get a little pricy for BBQ, mostly because we tend to not be able to decide and order a lotta food. But, it's totally worth it! Midwood is one of our Charlotte favorites!",

The meat smelled foul and was gray (over cooked?)... it tasted like it may have been microwaved at one point, but I'm not sure. I have no idea what would explain the smell and taste of the meat, but I just know it was gross. I tried two ribs (I hoped the first was a fluke, but it wasn't) and ate the side of cornbread.   Service was great, but hard to make up for the gross meat. Our waitress asked if we wanted to box it up, and was probably confused as to why the plate was relatively full.   I will say that my wife did enjoy her dinner, but was likewise grossed out by mine.  It'll be a while until we go back... at least until this special is over.",

    "text": "Today we stopped in to the Midwood Smokehouse in Ballantyne on the suggestion of one of our group members (my daughter) who had been previously.  A couple of us were newbies and a bit hesitant because none of our group are pork eaters.  The manager had explained to my daughter that they have very strict rules in the preparation of the food keeping all meats separate with no cross contamination.  The manager was very clear in explaining which side dishes and veggies contained pork and which did not.  The facility was large, very uniquely decorated and well lit.  They had TVs playing so we could watch the March Madness Games if we wanted but they also had music playing at a pleasant level.   We decided order and our server Matt made that very easy.  He had such an easy going, laid back demeanor that we could have stayed all day.  We ordered some beer, wings and all tried the brisket in one way or another.  The food was simply \"off the chain\" and Matt's service was superior.  Everything came out HOT and straight off the grill.  The flavors were amazing and the meat was so tender.  If you are on a budget consider an entree and an appetizer to share.  Portion sizes are good.  The bathrooms were clean, smelled fresh and were well stocked.  I will definitely go again and will look forward to trying additional things from the menu.",

Did a ToGo order of a half rack of ribs w.crispy fries as my side. Got in my car, opened the fries to have a few, but they were so good I ate a little more than a few! Tawny golden, thinner then usual crinkle cuts which actually came as a full side, in it's own separate container (yay!). The hefty Texas style ribs were smokey, very moist, topped with a smear of a tomato-based, sweet & savory sauce and fell-off-the bone! Look at how much meat was on them! I only ate 2! Hush puppies, a side of BBQ sauce and slivers of sweet onion also come with the meal. This is the best BBQ I have ever eaten! This gem is somewhat hidden so I forget it's there, but not anymore! I'll go back to try other food, bc the dishes coming out of the kitchen looked scrumptious! Even better, the staff was courteous, friendly and very well trained. $15 well spent!",

My lean brisket had a great smoke ring and the right amount of juice.  My bacon wrapped jalapenos were just amazing as I remember and a highlight for me.  The pickled onions were also very tasty.  My wife's salmon was cooked perfectly.  The kids' meals were very good as well.    The only downside was not particularly attentive service.  The best example was when she refilled my iced tea, she brought room temperature tea which melted all of the ice in my class.  This left me with a like warm overfilled glass...  Yes, overfilled in that she spilled it on the floor and table when refilling.  I am not a fan of hovering wait staff, but this was to the other extreme.  It was not particularly busy so maybe this was just a bad night.    In all, we are reminded of how much we love the food at Midwood and look forward to more visits soon.",

Last night was a terrible experience with the service, we waited about 25 to 30 min for a table which I understand it was a Sat night around 7ish. Once our table was available we sat and waited for a good 15 - 20 min completely ignored until a woman I believe was a manager noticed and offered to take our drink order explaining that our waitress was just taking another table's order and would be with us soon. We watched this woman go back and forth from two tables next to us and the register to put orders and not once approached our table to explain or just let us know that we would be next or anything at all! My son is in the hospitality industry and he was fuming... I was trying to be patient because I love this place, I have to agree this was completely rude and left a really bad feeling. 25 minutes later no drinks except for water, we decided to walk out and went to Firebirds, were we felt more appreciated.",

I am surprised by some of the reviews bc we came with a big group and had an excellent meal. The BBQ was just as good as any of our previous meals at the central location. The ribs we had were insanely good along with the burnt ends, pulled pork and brisket. Midwood did not disappoint.",

    "text": "We had our rehearsal dinner at Midwood a few weeks ago and it turned out absolutely fabulously. Midwood is one of our favorite spots and we both knew we wanted to have our rehearsal here b/c the food is so Carolina and southern to us. I want to be clear that the success of this dinner is a testament to the staff at Midwood Ballantyne rather than the Midwood private events coordinator. I hate leaving negative reviews for 1 person but I felt Mark, in comparison to all of our other wedding vendors we worked with, was an office oriented person and regurgitated our contract when asked about things. It seemed like he was quick to say no or put restrictions on simple requests. An example of this is when asked if his staff could hang up 1 small banner and light a few LED votives in paper lanterns, he said no and told us we could get there 30 minutes before our scheduled dinner to set up decor but added that he couldn't guarantee our room would even be available 30 minutes prior. As a rehearsal dinner, of course we were going to be rehearsing right beforehand. Fortunately, I stopped by a few hours before our dinner on a whim (was getting manicure at Apple Nails across the street) and the staff on site was SO HELPFUL and didn't hesitate to say \"yes, we can easily take 5 minutes to hang a banner & turn on 10 LED votives!\". Anyway, with that rant out of the way, I want to make sure that I give credit to not only the awesome wait staff (wish I remembered their names!) but also the kitchen team b/c the food was wonderful. As always! We had about 30 people, so we chose to do 2 meat buffet with several sides, wings as appetizers, banana pudding dessert and beer and wine. Now on their private events menu they don't offer fries as a side and they actually forgot them initially but when I mentioned that we were supposed to have fries, they served a bunch of baskets of fries on all our tables! Which turned out great and I think people enjoyed having them to snack on (especially since french fries don't really translate well to heating dishes, right?). We stayed late and almost closed the place down, they were so nice and even brought out takeout boxes so that our guests could take leftovers! I would probably hesitate to book another Private Event with them b/c I like a more receptive Events Manager.  I have booked private events at The Capital Grill and Dressler's (both locations) and their Events Team were more customer service oriented, flexible and understanding with small requests. They are willing to go around their \"rules\" to make your event a success... and while the staff at Midwood Ballantyne were awesome, I shouldn't have to show up in person and request things on site and hope they are willing to do it for me, it's not fair to me or the team working that night. Love Midwood as always and I think it's the best BBQ in Charlotte so I will definitely be back :)",

Wasn't a fan of that sauce, but my wife had the standard midwood sauce, and I was able to dip the burnt ends in that and it was a lot better.  The macaroni and cheese was the highlight.  That was really enjoyable.  The beer was ice cold and the server was friendly.  Food came out quick.  I like to eat, but I'll tell you, they give a lot of food in the large portion.  Couldn't finish it.  I'll go back again.  Either way it's worth a visit.",

Sides of collard greens, Mac and cheese, hush puppies were all delicious with flavors that held their own along side the smoked meats. Last note on the service. Not only was our server on top of keeping our drinks filled but every server and manager who passed us were scanning the tables to take away plates or fill up drinks. Team work has the place running smoothly during an otherwise busy lunch hour.",

When employees go out of their way to show others the level of respect that the employees did at this restaurant today, it not only makes the dining experience memorable, but it shows that good people are in every corner of the world and are ready and able to serve others.

I usually go for the ribs but our server had suggested the burnt ends and they were phenomenal.  Will definitely be ordering them again in the future.  The banana pudding is the best I've ever had.  My only complaint is the music- needs a lot of improvement. They had also ran out of a beer that I wanted but our server, Jennifer, gave me similar options and I ended up picking one I liked even better than my first choice.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable- excellent service and good at her job.  I also appreciate the manager checking in on us to see how we were doing.  Great food and service, just work on the music (type and volume).",

I love the True flavor of grilled meat, without all the sauce and seasonings. My bro in law makes the best ribs, so juicy and succulent and real, no smoky flavor. With that being said, we ordered the Smoked Jalapeno popper wrapped in bacon. They were inedible, thats how hot they were. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know jalapenos are hot and I love heat, but these were horrificly hot and the smoke \"flavoring\" was so overbearing, I had to send them back. They were very understanding about that. We split the combo of ribs with coleslaw and hushpuppies. The ribs were tender and meaty and tasted good, but Not succulent and juicy and unctuous like my bro in law's. The coleslaw was a little dry, need some mayo. The hushpuppies were delicious!! They were really small tho. They were not hot, but they were crispy and oh so flavorful. We ordered dessert. I ordered Keylime pie and he ordered Banana pudding. He loved it, I didnt taste it. Mine was ok, but too cold and hard. I'll try again and the looks of the pics posted here, I'm going with the Brisket. You southerners might love this place, but its just not what I'm used to.",

I've made trips to nationally rated BBQ joints in both states, Sweatman's, Scott's, BBQ King and Lexington, among others. None are close to Midwood to me. If you don't like smoked meats then this is not the place for you. But if you do, you won't find any better. Moist and tasty, don't ruin this by putting sauce on it. Kudos to Hayley, an excellent waitress on two occasions I have been. To management, make a trip to Pit BBQ in Griffin Ga for some outstanding Brunswick Stew. You would make a killing as a side here in Charlotte. And gluten free, please.",

I have a million things to do to ensure everything runs smoothly. I come here on Monday to ask about an order I need on Saturday (they require 24 hours notice). The manager said I can pay on Thursday if I want (I want to get that money out and have that order taken care of). She took down my name and that I need this by 12:30.   I'm not sure what sides I want so I place an order for several sides and the dude at the bar messed it up. My husband, baby and I are waiting.... Waiting... Waiting... I come to the bar to ask about my order. He's like \"I'm sorry I thought that was for the order you want to place for this weekend. I thought that's why you wanted the manager.\" Huuuu... When I went to the Take Out side I told the guy I need 2 things: I want to place an order to go (he took down the sides that I wanted) and that I needed to discuss an order for Saturday. Smh.  Anyway, fast forward to the day of the party. I'm having it at the Gymboree (read my review for that) and I had 30 minutes to set up, so I'm scrambling, trying to get everything in order before the guests show up. My Godmother and Godsister show up early to help out. I ask my Godmother to pick up the food as it's already paid for. She calls me after getting to the place at around 12:45 saying that it's not ready. Ummmmm... I told them I needed my order by 12:30. Why isn't it ready???!!! Perhaps they should have taken my number down to update me that my order would be a little late. Actually, wait... they told me they didn't have my order. And I'm like \"HUH???!!!\" Uuuuuuhhhh... I paid $300 for that food. THEY BETTER HAVE MY ORDER!!!\" She said they found (whatever they needed to find) and that they would have it out to my   Now to the food. Huuuu... Another disappointment. The mac and cheese was good when I ordered a side to go. But ordering this in bulk is clearly no bueno. Along with the chicken (which was dry as shit) and the tea. Everyone kept asking me if it was sweet tea. It was not sweet. It tasted like leftover tea from the bottom of a canister.   The only items that were good were the shredded pork (should have had 3 lbs of that), veggies and baked beans.   I made some rainbow fruit skewers and everyone tore that up! I mean literally those joints were gone in seconds. I got rave reviews about the skewers and the party in general but yea nada comments about the food. I feel like it was a waste. Should have ordered from Viva Chicken. I think I'm done with this place. The food is not good enough for me to order in bulk or even return for a sit down.",

We came on opening weekend and it happened to be Mothers Day weekend too, they were slammed but still accommodated our large party.   I had the brisket and was shocked to be asked if I preferred the lean cuts, fatty cuts or both (I picked both). I'm glad they offered b/c they both were delicious.   We can't wait to come back to have a beer or two with some good Carolina BBQ!!!!!",

The place has that rustic feel to  it that you would expect at a BBQ joint, and there is a quaint little patio area outside for dining as well.   My fiance suggested the smoked wings, and Midwood Smokehouse didn't disappoint! The wings were smokey and actually seasoned very well without the seasoning being overbearing. The sauce was great, but it honestly wasn't required.   Our waiter was Zach, and although we only ordered two sets of wings and a Bloody Mary, he treated us as though we had a $150 tab. We interacted with several over staff members during our stay that were extremely pleasant as well.   I would recommend this location if you had a choice !",

I placed my drink order and received it before the others, who then waited another 20 minutes for theirs to arrive. That should have told us what kind of night it was going to be. After looking over the menu, which I will say is a lot, I decided to go with the small pulled pork plate. Others ordered the Cuban sandwich, ribs and pulled pork as well. My platter came with one side, I chose cole slaw and ordered a side of sweet potato fries.  Service was a little off, but we did receive our dinners and unfortunately I received fries as my side, not cole slaw, plus another plate of fries. Okay, too many fries going on. After catching multiple waitresses I finally received my slaw. And, not really sure it was worth it. The pulled pork was great, the fries were crisp and cooked too perfection, but the slaw...very blah in my mind. Definitely missing something.  Overall the others enjoyed their food, but not sure I would rush back to this location.",

They bartenders at this location all act like they are better than you, and the same goes for the waitresses, it is a shame that they act like that when they are depending on tips as their income.  The food quality is ok, they do use the cheap ketchup though, and also charge extra money for such small things as ranch sauce.  If you can skip this place I would recommend doing that.

When the order finally came out, it was wrong! When I asked to speak to the manager, he wasn't even apologetic. It was as if it was a chore to deal with a customer who had every right to be frustrated. He did not offer to right their wrong, in fact he offered me nothing! I got my money back and left. You can do better than this Midwood. Hope it was worth losing a long time customer.",

Very good greens. The pepper vinegar has a bit of heat to it be careful. Glad the meat had such great taste because their sauces are OK.

When you walk in, you'll be amazed at how big this place is.  Super clean, lots of seating and a large bar.  The decor is pretty neat- bbq themed stuff (check out the ladies room- you will crack up!) also, according to my husband, slave leia from Star Wars is hanging in the men's room which is AWESOME.    Now let's get to the most important part- THE FOOD.  We ended up getting the combo platter and selected the largest portion they offer which is called \"pig out\".   You get to chose 4 proteins so we did the Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, pulled chicken bbq, and the saint Louis style pork ribs.  You also get a side of hush puppies with it and a It choice of two sides.   We obviously picked the mac n cheese because who doesn't love that?  The other side was the bacon wrapped jalapenos.  I also ordered the smoked vegetables on the side because those sounded interesting.   (Try the tangy mustard sauce, I put that on the chicken and was not disappointed at all).  EVERYTHING we ate was fantastic.    The manager came over to us to say hello and also explained that the hickory wood is locally sourced, they don't use a gas smoker- This is the real thing here.   We initially planned on wrapping half of our food for leftovers but we cleared our plates.    I would be doing this place an injustice if I didn't brag about the whiskey and bourbon menu.  What's bbq without a good whisky on the side?   It is pretty expansive with plenty of options to chose from.  You can also pick your own flight!    Our waitress Erin was a doll.  She went over the entire menu with us and was very knowledgeable and kind.  Overall we were extremely impressed.  We will be coming back when we are back in town.",

Those running the restaurant on the floor to oversee the operations were clearly visible, giving all sorts of verbal instructions to the servers of what is needed or where. This completely interrupted our dining experience.  Service was basic -- not outstanding. We had to flag down our server on several occasions.  Once the food arrived, it was also disappointing. I had asked for \"lean no fat\" brisket and there was clearly fat along the edges in several places.  This location does not stand out as one I would like to visit again. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "This is a great Midwood Smokehouse location. (But shouldn't it officially be called Ballantyne Smokehouse if it's here?) They have all the same offerings that the other location does except in a larger and less densely packed layout. Also seems to not get hit quite as hard as the original Plaza Midwood location. And for out of towners, it makes for the best southern BBQ.  The menu offers everything they've got at the original. Pulled pork and chicken, burnt ends of beef or pork, ribs, brisket and so on. These days I take it easy on the meats and they make that an option with some salads on the menu. Still, their claim to fame is clear. You can get the Well-Fed with 4 different meats chosen from a list of 5 or 6 including beef, pork and chicken. This also includes two sizable sides (collard greens, mayo OR vinegar based slaw, mac and cheese, and the to-die-for bacon wrapped jalapenos, among others) meaning you will end up quite well fed. If you leave hungry or without a to-go box, you messed up somewhere...  The prices aren't bad, especially when you consider the volume and quality of food here. The service I experienced was excellent, especially since I was visiting with a colleague from out of town.",

It is back and I love it!  My favorite time is to swing by after church (Calvary Church...shameless plug) when the Panthers are playing.  I enjoy the first half of the game with my family and then head home at half time!    My favorite dish is their smoked brisket with collard greens.  Get their pepper sauce!  If the color is bright...it is new and not too hot, but if you want good flavor, look for the more muted colors.  They have at least 3 types of hot pepper in the sauce, which makes for a yummy taste.  The brisket is tender and smoky, and really does not need sauce, but the sauce is tasty too.    The bacon wrapped jalapenos vary in heat...be warned...sometimes you will get a tasty one that seems mild, and then sometimes you will get a heat bite...still tasty, but be aware.  Oh, and the pecan \"cobbler\" is rich and yummy...plan on rolling out of there if you get that.  It is football season, see you there.",

Went to the Ballantyne location and my Mac and Cheese was dry, my pull pork sandwich barely had any meat on it, the burnt ends were not as tasty! I give it 2 stars only because the baked beans were great! The Ballantyne location is nice and pleasant however if you want EXCELLENT food the real Midwood way go to the location on Central for the real smoked, southern, good taste of food! Ughh! So upset!",

This place is so overrated and just plain SUCKS. Their macaroni was acceptable, but the bbq was purely unpleasant. Very soggy, oily and just a bad taste with nasty sauces. I have had way better bbq at Shane's Rib Shack, Sonny's and the Golden Corral. Midwood is thriving on the herd mentality of people for now. Those who assume that they must have good food if they are busy. There are too many options that are far better. I took my food home, reheated it and tried it with Sweet Baby Ray's. Still was plum nasty. Hopeless. I didn't even want to complain because I was done with that place.",

Even though the restaurant was packed she kept refills coming, table clean and packaged up to-go items with fresh containers of sauce. All done with a smile.

We walked in for lunch one day with our baby and the hostess started to ask us all these questions about our child, which we were totally fine with. Then she proceeded to tell us 1. Our baby was way too young to be out in public, how dare we be out grabbing lunch 2. That we don't have him \"bundled up enough\" (it was 60 degrees) and 3. She even made an extremely rude comment about my husbands weight to him! We are new parents and we felt totally \"parent shamed\" by this complete stranger. This was in the span of 5 minutes where she sat us down and then wouldn't leave our table. She completely over stepped her boundaries. Her job was to simply take us to our table! The waiter was pretty great though probably trying to cover up her idiotic behavior. Horrible experience. We will never come back because of her extremely inappropriate behavior. Management- do yourself a favor and reprimand your hostess.",

I'd say the sides were better than the BBQ.  I got the pulled pork and brisket.  It was under flavored.  The BBQ sauce was decent, but it just wasn't good enough to season the underflavored meat.  The creamed corn and the pecan pie were the stars of the meal.  The hush puppies were dry and flavorless.  The baked beans were good too.  Overall, a very disappointing meal.",

I remember coming in before Midwood took over and having my pick of the tables at lunch - now you have to wait 5-10 minutes on most days.  Service is however still quite fast, and my colleagues and I are typically able to get in and out within the hour.    Have tried several different options and enjoyed them all.  The mac 'n cheese is a bit too cheesy for me, but the smoked veggies and collared greens are both delicious.  Had the Abilene Press today and enjoyed the brisket and melted Gouda.  Will definitely be coming back for more BBQ when back in the Ballantyne area!",

With that being said, we waited the 20-25 minutes they told us we would. We were seated, with our waitress showing up shortly thereafter. She wasn't rattled or rushed and got our drink order out quickly; she took our food order, and our meal came out fast, considering the crowd. Like with any other time we've been to Midwood, we thoroughly enjoyed our food- my husband got barbeque and I got chicken tacos. More than enough food and always consistent in taste. We spent $25 on 2 meals, not including tip. People were waiting outside and several deep when we left at 7:15. Worth the wait! Apparently they now take reservations, which we will remember next time.",

Also, this location doesn't have the fried Mac and cheese which the Central Ave location does.  There are two main perks with this location.... 1. I haven't had them run out of food, like the central Ave location. 2. The place is definitely more spacious.  All in all.... I would visit again since it's close to my job, but when it's the weekend, I would rather go all the way to Central Ave than to go to the location that's 10 minutes away from my house",

I've been to the Plaza Midwood location a few times and decided to give this location a try as it's closer and newer (I think). The parking lot is pretty small, especially if you drive a big truck. We were quickly greeted and sat, even on a Friday night. The booths were large and comfy. The one we were at in particular, was round which was really cool! Our server (I wish I caught her name to give her a shoutout) was so phenomenal. From the moment we got there, she was so welcoming and asked if it was our first time and since it was for a few at our table, she took time to explain what they're all about.   We tried their special of the day as an app, which was a jalapeno cornbread skillet with a sweet butter on top. Wow was that ever good! You don't totally taste the jalapenos in the sense of their spiciness but it definitely added to the dish. We tried a variety of things for dinner and everyone had great things to say. They give you plentiful portions, so much that mine turned into two more meals for myself.   This is the first NC BBQ place I ever tried when coming to Charlotte and it has remained a steadfast favorite. I recommend this location based on their service, restaurant size and quality barbecue",

    "text": "Although Charlotte isn't known for barbecue, a lot of new barbecue joints are popping up in the area. These places are much different than the old school joints like Bill Spoon's. For example, Midwood's original location is a full-size sit-down restaurant much like this location in Ballantyne. I typically prefer to get my barbecued meats to go or at least in a fast-casual setting. However, Midwood is great for larger groups and special occasion celebrations.  The prices are higher than some of the other places but the quality of the meat is similar. The brisket is very good but probably not the best I've had. The pimento cheese fries and bacon-wrapped jalapenos are popular appetizers and we almost always get the former. On Saturdays and Sundays, they offer a 16 ounce beef rib for $28 and it is outstanding.  Our service has been excellent except for some miscommunication about a dessert on our most recent visit. They advertised a seasonal peach cobbler but we received their normal pecan cobbler. It was good but just not what we expected.  If you're in the area and  want a nice sit-down barbecue meal, Midwood Smokehouse is a solid choice.",

We ordered the burnt ends and they were outstanding. My 4 daughters ordered rack of ribs and backed beens. Pulled pork sandwich without coleslaw. Cheese fries. Kids pulled pork sandwich and fruit. They loved it all and they are picky as he...... The wife ordered the half bbq chiten all white meat and loved that also. I got the pick 4 meants with jalapeno cheese sausage, ribs, burnt ends, and brisket  and it too was outstanding with double mac and cheese. Try the sauces as it brings out a great new flavor to the meats. We finished with banana pudding and other than not being as cold as i like mine it was great. Give this place a try and you will keep coming back.",

    "text": "I was on a road trip with my girlfriend, her two kids, and my two kids heading from Cleveland to Orlando for a vacation. Along the way I was determined to find a BBQ shack for some good ol' Down South BBQ. Unfortunately, I never found it. What I did find, while stopping for the night in Charlotte NC on our way back home, however, was Midwood Smokehouse.   I don't know if Midwood qualifies for \"real deal\" Down South BBQ or not, because, like I said, I'm from Cleveland, and my idea of BBQ is maybe Famous Dave's, or Old Carolina Barbeque Company, or even Michael Simon's Mabel's BBQ (but Michael Simon is from Cleveland too, so he's probably not an authority on the subject either), but what I can tell you is this was some darn good food.   We arrived on a Saturday night at about 5:30, and the six of us were seated immediately. Had we arrived 10-minutes later, I bet the wait would have been 45 minutes. Seriously. By the time we left the line was out the door. This place is really good.   I ordered the Chicken and Ribs combo (1/2 chicken and 1/3 slab of ribs) with Mac n' Cheese and Baked Beans. I don't know if I've ever had better as far as the chicken and ribs are concerned. Portions we're huge. I couldn't finish, but I relished each and every bite that I had.   Our server, Walter, was also top notch, and definitely the reason for 5-stars. He took his time to explain the menu, their smoking process, the different sauces; had a little banter with each of the kids. He really made us all feel welcome. Really great guy with a great personality for dealing with the public. It's often a thankless job, so this one's for you Walter - THANK YOU!   I may not ever get back to Charlotte, but if I do, I know where I would stop if I want great BBQ and even better service. Midwood Smokehouse for sure.",

I always get the brisket because it's juicy and flavorful. The vinegar based slaw is really good, as well as the Mac and cheese.  I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking for good southern BBQ.",

The jalapeno wrapped bacon appetizers arrived super fast but, I'm kind of leery of food being too prompt as my mind wonders if it's been sitting under warmers. However, it was delicious with ranch dressing on the side.   Beef ribs plate w/vinegar based slaw and collards. On point!  Smoked wings crispy style. First, I had asked what the crispy means. It means twice fried. Honestly, my wings were shriveled up and dry with barely flavor. Crispy yes!   The selection of sauces are slim, and lack flavor. I feel like they need something memorable for sauces. Disappointed about the sauces, i look forward to trying them.",

Plus, they have Cheerwine in a glass bottle and a fantastic whiskey selection. Who could ask for more? Delicious sides: mac & cheese, baked beans, bacon jalapeno, and the hushpuppies. The creamed corn didn't do it for me and I'm not a fan of the pickled onions. But it doesn't matter, because the meat is amazing and that's what's most important. Also, the staff is super duper friendly and they have a separate gluten free menu for those who need it.",

The character of the Plaza Midwood location is gone, and this location feels like any chain place in the area.   While the food was pretty good, my wife and I had a generally bad service experience. Our waitress was far from attentive, so ordering and getting refills was a tedious process. The worst thing came hidden in our chips and queso: random nasty, burned pieces of fryer garbage were strewn throughout our chips. Apparently general kitchen cleanliness is an issue at this location. Worse yet, when we brought the issue up to our waitress, she barely apologized and didn't comp it at all.   Overall, I won't be back to this location, even if I'm in the area. There are too many food choices in Charlotte to settle for mediocrity.",

    "text": "Visited the new Ballantyne location of Midwood Smokehouse yesterday for lunch. I was by myself and figured the location would be insanely crowded, but decided to walk in to see.  I've tried to talk my husband into going, but he's always adamant that he likes to give new restaurants \"a month or so\" to work out any kinks before he tries them. Since he was off doing something else for the afternoon, it was my chance to try it without him.  The restaurant was busy, but there was no wait and there were seats available at the bar. I grabbed a chair and ordered a PBR ($2.50 drafts!) and after a brief review of the menu, figured I'd try the side dishes/veggie combination plate instead of going for actual barbecue on this visit. I figure this way my husband can't get TOO upset that I went without him for my first visit!   I ordered the creamed corn, cole slaw and stuffed jalapenos. I was originally going to get hushpuppies as one of the items but Chad, the bartender, assured me my dish would come with a few since the platter of sides was considered a \"plate\". When it came out devoid of hushpuppies he noticed instantly and said to the foodrunner,  \"We're going to need a side of hushpuppies and pickled onions for that.\" They were delivered right away. Thanks for having my back, Chad!  The creamed corn was delicious. I chose to believe it was \"healthy\" in spite of the clear abundance of well, cream, in the dish. I was least enthusiastic for the coleslaw, but it ended up being my favorite item on the plate! The 3 jalapenos were delicious, but a little small. I'm used to a friend's bacon-wrapped jalapenos which are not halved, and are enormous.   Some people have written that they find the hush puppies too sweet. I find them to be just perfect, no ketchup needed to enjoy! I also loved the pickled onions. I devoured everything on my plate quickly, and found it to be just the right amount of food. I've never had a chance to try all the delicious sides I've wanted, so this was a great opportunity.  Chad made me feel welcome and was very attentive, getting me a second PBR just before mine went empty. We shared some Words with Friends strategy during a moment of downtime, as he saw I was playing on my phone.  I was very impressed just watching Chad work. He handled a few carry out orders, and as each one showed up, he opened up all the containers to quality check them, and went back for a few items with each one. This restaurant, being so new, probably still has a little confusion going on, but he made sure every order was right, whether it was mine or the carryout orders.  All told, my bill was $12.99 for a delicious meal and 2 PBR's. The value for what I received can't be beat!  I was originally thinking I might be uncomfortable eating solo at what is so clearly a sit down family restaurant, but the bartenders were all very friendly, and it was such an enjoyable lunch I definitely see swinging by for more solo lunches in the future!",

My boyfriend ordered the Carolina pork which he couldn't even eat because the after taste was terrible. The waitress then told us that the after taste was probably the vinegar that was in the pork. We hate to make any trouble but we just couldn't stand the taste of it. She nicely offered to take it back and get us something else. My boyfriend then ordered the burnt ends. He liked it much more than the Carolina pork but still it wasn't that great. As for me, I got the 1/2 chicken. The only pro was that the serving was huge but I was disappointed that the chicken barely had any flavor. I had to constantly put salt and black pepper on it just for it to taste ok. The cream corn had a weird taste to it and I just didn't care much for the collard greens. The only thing I probably enjoyed was the hush puppies. I didn't want to cause more trouble than we already have so I just tried to eat what I could.  Even though the food wasn't great, I'm giving this place a three star for their service. They took the food back with no trouble and constantly checked up on us. Everyone was very nice and our waitress was very understanding.   To conclude this, I probably won't be back just because the food was mediocre. But thank you to Midwood Smokehouse for the great customer service!",

And despite waiting nearly 40 minutes for a table, we were not disappointed. The brisket and pulled pork were both cooked to perfection, the mac & cheese was delicious, and the hush puppies completely irresistible. As at the original location, the beer selection was outstanding, with a wide variety of local crafts on tap and an extensive menu of bottles.   My only real complaint was the lack of seating in the hostess area, which made the long wait for a table more unpleasant than it needed to be -- especially with the kids in tow. But otherwise, the Ballantyne location is another fantastic addition to the Queen City's 'Q' scene!",

I almost let go of the steering wheel she was so good.   Just as a preface...I smoke bbq at my house often and have eaten it all over the country, just look at my profile pic. I've actually stopped eating bbq unless it's a special occasion because so many places are let downs. This place isn't a let down so start driving now if you're considering.   We started with the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeno's which are money. I don't order straight up bbq anymore so I had the taco's. Well thought out and executed as I would do them. I had to do the hushpuppies and they were worth cheating with fried foods. My son did the brisket sammich, I tasted it and they did a good job on it.   It was lunch time so I didn't order beer but they have a cool bar with tons of different beers. I may have to come back after 5 for some beers.   I will go back when in the area and so should you...always good to have a legit bbq joint in the hood near me. Just an FYI my dad went here three days ago on my advice and did order the straight up ribs, pulled pork and brisket. He's into bbq too and said it was spot on.",

Everything was wonderful, from the meat selections to the sides on to dessert. Portion sizes are huge so be prepared to either share or have leftovers to take home. We were there on a Sunday mid to late afternoon, our server was excellent. Our friends had previously shared how great their dining experience at this location so we couldn't wait to give them a try. We certainly were not disappointed in the least. They have a full service bar as well as numerous draft beers on tap from local breweries. It's nearly impossible to pick our favorite menu choice as everything was so good. If you've not had the pleasure of enjoying Midwood Smokehouse you are missing out!!",

I tend to find something on menus I love and stick with it, and I struck gold my first visit. Their 1930 Cheesesteak is ridiculously good. A Philly cheesesteak with brisket, genius. The girlfriend usually orders the burnt ends with the Cheerwine BBQ sauce, and I've snagged an end once or twice. I'm happy to report that Midwood isn't a one trick pony. Hers is always fantastic as well. To top it off, they offer a fairly extensive list of beer, wine, and spirits. You've done it Midwood, you lit the fire inside me for pork BBQ. You're the new yardstick by which I judge all other BBQ. Hats off to you Midwood. Well done.",

The issue I have with this place, which is why I am leaving four stars, is that they are more expensive than the one on Central Avenue.   I made the mistake of ordering something that I would normally get at the other one and it cost about nine dollars more here. Needless to say I was fuming. I just chalked it up because I never looked at their menu prices because I thought they were all the same. When I told the lady about it she seemed to have a very nonchalant kind of f@$# you attitude. Obviously the food is good enough that I returned because this one is closer to my house. But still... At least you know.",

Menu of beef, chicken, and pork sandwiches , entrees, bbq plates, appetizers,   tacos, salads and a variety of sides, bbq sauces, and 2 yummy dessert items, banana pudding and pecan cobbler.  Menu prices reasonable, food nicely plated,  and served hot. Walter told us everything prepared  fresh on premises except the fries. We ordered the hickory smoked bbq chicken with 2 sides. I got the sweet potato fries and coleslaw, my mate the baked beans and coleslaw. Hush puppies and pickled onions came with the chicken. The chicken was delicious and tender, coleslaw mediocre, baked beans delicious as well as the hush puppies and pickled onions. Sauces  for our chicken were mustard based and a sweet hot Midwood sauce. 2 other bottled sauces on the table were heated in plastic bottles. I asked how they were heated, yes in hot water, not the micro. We would return to try other menu items.",

We were worried that we'd have to wait a while for a seat, but the place is definitely bigger than it looks and we were seated right away. There was more of a crowd closer to 7, though. I was dead set on getting a brisket quesadilla, but I think I saw an outdated version of their menu, so I got the Midwood grilled cheese with brisket instead. I'm not sad at all I had to pivot because it was delicious! The cheese pull was real. I poured the Midwood sauce on it and it was fantastic. I got that sandwich and a side of sweet potato fries for less than $10, which I consider a steal!",

No joking Midwood smokehouse literally blew my mind, and not only did it blow my mind but it was raved by the group I was with last night that swore up and down that Texas had the best BBQ. I believe that Midwood Smokehouse made some converts!  I came here with a rather large group probably around 14 people and the staff was great and the restaurant accommodated flawlessly! Of course with such large groups everyone of course was not seated at the same time.  Everytime but noticed that no matter when another couple came the servers were right there to get drink orders in big props to the FOH Crew. Now here was what really blew my mind with a 14 top everyone's orders came out about the same time and was just still hot and delicious,Big big props to the BOH Crew. I'm sure that's not a easy task.  Now for the food yeah anything on the menu is going to be really good. Your standard pulled pork I've had before and it is  banging. But last night I tried the Burnt Ends mainly thinking the name sounds absolutely disgusting, well rest assured it's anything but! Seriously those burnt ends were just soooo good My mouth is watering just thinking about them.   If you're in the area and looking for some probably some of the best BBQ in Charlotte don't need to look any further.",

The mac and cheese was dry so I decided to get the smoked vegetable, which was absolutely delicious. I was surprised they used fresh vegetables instead of a frozen medley. My son ordered the cheeseburger for $9 and it was a very decent size. He also ordered the mac and cheese and liked it. Different taste buds I guess.  My husband ordered a half a slab of ribs and fries for $16. He thought his ribs were okay but not the best he's had. We are from the south so we've had some pretty good barbecue.   The North Carolina vinegar sauce wasn't really to my liking. My favorite barbecue sauce is usually the Carolina mustard sauce, which was just okay. I was surprised that I wasn't a big fan of it. The house sauce is actually really really good. The waitress was really nice and so was the host, even though they forgot to call us when it was time for us to come in. Overall, pleasant experience.",

Now the food...I feel like the amount of food for the price is definitely worth it. You get your \"bang for your buck\". I enjoyed my chicken and I loved my fries. It is one of the best crinkly fries I've had. It wasn't over fried or soggy, it was just right. Our server recommended the mac and cheese. My boyfriend loved it but I didn't care for it. That's why I didn't give this place 5 stars. I thought it tasted doughy. The texture just wasn't there for me but everything else was great. I would definitely come back.",

This is a fairly large place and has a good aesthetic. The beer selection is extensive with a lot on tap. We ordered the burnt ends and bbq chicken. The burnt ends were basically brisket tips cut from the edge of the brisket then tossed in a sweet bbq sauce. It was quite good actually, very smokey though which for me was great. The sides were done well. The service was friendly and we received our food quickly even though the place was pretty hoppin. The experience was good all round. Highly recommend.",

I don't typically like smoked/BBQ food, but this was chosen by friends so I thought I'd give it a shot. The brisket was delicious! I got it on a salad, which was filled with fresh lettuce and other vegetables. We also got the cheese fries and BBQ cheese dip, delicious as well! Everyone else loved their meals too. Service was also superb! Like I said, I typically don't care for smoked/BBQ food and I am already looking forward to going back! I have also been to Mac's and would choose Midwood over Mac's in a heartbeat!",

The chicken was delicious, but I have to save the Mac and cheese was awesome!  My fiance had the burnt ends....said they were perfect, with a great smoke flavor.  Service was spot on, and the atmosphere was nice.  We'll be back next time we are in town.",

Our server ( who was sooo attentive, and patient with our chatting it up at length before ordering) suggested the Midwood sauce with the brisket if I desired sauce - and he was right!  The combination of the beef flavor, smoke, fat, and sauce was absolute heaven!  The baked beens were good too, but I didn't much care for the charred/burnt pieces of meat in it.  This was my first time at this location and I really enjoyed my visit... The music selection was also spot on...just sayin'",

    "text": "After some extensive searching on Yelp, I knew I had to try Midwood Smokehouse while I was in Charlotte. I'm a sucker for good barbecue and was excited to give Carolina-style barbecue a try. Midwood Smokehouse has three different locations in Charlotte, but I chose this one because it was closest to my hotel.  I arrived around 7 pm on a Monday and it was pretty empty. I sat at the bar and the bartender was incredibly nice and helpful, and made great suggestions on what to get. On Mondays they have $3 off all cocktails which is a great deal. I got the Bramble On cocktail which was delicious and refreshing.   If I wasn't alone I definitely would have gone with the Combo Platter, where you can choose 4 different meats. Instead, I decided on a small platter with Lean Brisket. The bartender also suggested I add one of their Smoked Sausages and for my side I chose Mac and Cheese (of course). All I can say is WOW, it was all fantastic. The brisket melted in your mouth and I liked that you could choose between lean, fatty, or both for your cuts of brisket. You also have a choice of 5 different barbecue sauces to compliment the meat. I went with the spicy one for a little heat. I'm really glad I added the Sausage on the side, it was stuffed with jalapeno cheddar and couldn't have been more tasty. The Mac and cheese was delicious as well, not the best I've ever had but I don't have any complaints.  Sure dinner was a little on the pricey side, but it was worth it! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch and had a great meal. Split the Pig Out Combo Platter option with my boyfriend. Options for proteins are: Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, Saint Louis pork ribs, pulled chicken BBQ, and Hickory smoked sausage. You are supposed to pick 4 proteins, so you only have to decide which one of the 5 options you do not want. We decided to skip the sausage. The ribs were incredibly tender and effortlessly fell off the bone. I enjoyed the ribs the most, then the brisket, then the chicken, and then the pork. All of the meats were juicy except for the pork, which was dry. You are also given 4 sauces: South Carolina mustard, Eastern North Carolina vinegar, and Midwood signature and spicy habanero. I absolutely loved the Midwood signature sauce. It was sweet and tasty. The spicy habanero is mildly spicy. The mustard is just slightly too overpowering for me, but if you love mustard, it's great. I didn't care for the vinegar at all.  The meal also comes with 2 sides in addition to hushpuppies and pickled onions for $34. We opted for the mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapenos. Mac and cheese is usually our go-to side, but this was one of the few times that it disappointed me. The pasta was too chewy; it just needed to be cooked an extra minute longer. The cheese was not melted and gooey, but rather, clumpy and unappealing. I wish our meal came with more bacon wrapped jalapenos instead of only 3 pieces because they tasted great! Same issue with the hushpuppies; the meal only came with 5 pieces but I wish I was given more. The hushpuppies were dense and delicious. The pickled onions were great to mix with the meat.  Service was fantastic. Our waiter periodically checked on us to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. Boyfriend received soda refills without ever having to ask. Bathroom is decently clean. Parking was easy to find.",

The first thing that I thought was that it might not be that great because its in a retail shopping plaza. The atmosphere for having bbq should be one step removed from a tin shack, with a ceiling fan stuck on high speed and a dog barking in the background. Well, Midwood is nothing like that, but the interior decor suggests that they are serious about their food.   I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, slaw on top (natch) with crinkle cut fries. Absolutely delicious! I had a couple of beers and a nice chat with some locals across the bar from me. Normally, I write longer reviews, but I only had time to visit once so here are my impressions based on just one visit.  I liked the atmosphere and decor very much. My sandwich was very good, and a good value considering how big it was. The bartender was friendly. And, one of my biggest concerns about any restaurant is cleanliness. Midwood is clean and so is the restroom! That is a good sign that management is on top of things. Based on my one visit, I would recommend Midwood to anyone, and if I am in this part of Charlotte again, I will be sure to stop by.",

Midwood could get a 5 star rating with their baked beans alone. The beer selection is great and food is even better. Prices are extremely fair for the portion sizes. Their meats are all outstanding. Mac n cheese could use a little makeover, but overall it's not bad. Both locations are fantastic. If heart disease and obesity were not legitimate concerns, I'd eat here everyday.",

I called and inquired as to the wait time and they said that there wasn't one. We get there 10 minutes later and they said it would be at least 45 minutes . Hostess seemed totally indifferent. Too bad. Too good a restaurant to fall victim to poor staffing.",

    "text": "Ugh so disappointing. The other Midwood got such great reviews and I had my expectations set so high for this one, clearly too high. It's been open for a month or so now, but I haven't been since yesterday. I was really excited to get some good barbecue and went to Midwood with a friend on a Sunday afternoon.  The inside of the place looks great. Lots of wood colors that you'd expect at a barbecue place and a good amount of TVs. The bar even had power sockets which is a fantastic touch.   I got a half rack of ribs with the dry seasoning (per the waitress's advice, usually I go with wet ribs) and hushpuppies on the side. The food came out quickly, and the ribs looked delicious from the outside. The best ribs should be able to be eaten with a fork and no knife at all. These ribs did not pass the test. Lots of the meat was very tough and required heavy knife and mouth work to get it off. Not good. The taste was average. I didn't love the dry rub, but the sauce it came with was excellent. The hushpuppies were fantastic--not too heavy or buttery.  Our waitress was pleasant but really nothing more, maybe a little bit rushed. I wouldn't be running back to Midwood, but it would do in a pinch.",

Felt like i consumed a salt shaker with sub par service.  Had to stop at a gas station to get water after our meal, i was so thirsty.  Sides were good.  Mac and Cheese, BBQ Baked Beans, Fries, Hushpuppies (although on the small side).  Ribs were meaty but oversalted so there were hard to finish.  Same with the Chopped Pork.  The brisket was fatty.  The only thing that was worthwhile was the sausage.  Don't know why people would wait here to eat because you are better off going somewhere else for BBQ.",

Menu said it was chopped but the texture was more like they threw it in a blender and pureed it.  They also served it with bleu cheese on it, which sounded strange but I figured it must be good or they wouldn't serve it.  I was wrong.  It was not a good combination at all and I found myself looking for mints after my meal to get rid of the aftertaste.  In addition there was hardly any brisket in the sandwich.  In fact I think there may have been as much bleu cheese as meat.  My friend had something else and simply said their meal  was okay.  Was expecting more for the price. In addition the meat tasted strangely like it wasn't really smoked but just had some artificial smoke flavoring added.   Wanted to love this place but that isn't what happened.  Went back about a year later - Was better.  Got the burnt ends and they were pretty good, along with some collard greens.   Nothing amazing but pretty good.",

Went in for lunch on a weekday and sat at the bar again.   Was greeted and served immediately.   Order was taken and food arrived promptly.   My wife ordered a pork sandwich and I had the pork plate.  The pork was great.  This time the fries came out hot but still not as crisp as I like them.  They were good just a little too limp for my taste.  Cole slaw was good.  Hush puppies were great.  And I loved the pickled onions.  Two complaints:  1) the music is too loud for lunch time.   2) again, why no self serve sauces?  But those are minor complaints. Overall great food and a much better experience than my last time here.",

I had called ahead to make sure if there was a wait it was reasonable and when we showed up we were taken straight to a table. Great since we were starving! Almost immediately we put an order in for the cheese fries with brisket. The fries came out after we had ordered our mains and several of the fries were burnt.   Moving on to our mains I had ordered the big plate of lean brisket and a friend had ordered the half lean half fatty. When the waiter was handing me my plate I asked to verify that he was handing me the lean and not the mix (since my friend and I had the same sides). He said it looked like the mix so my friend and I swapped plates. Halfway through the meal we realized it was right the first time so we traded strips of lean and fatty. However I wasn't super invested in getting any more brisket since the strips I already had were dry and unimpressive. The brisket at the original location is one of my favorite meals in Charlotte.   Overall it was a fine experience but as other reviewers have mentioned it felt more like a chain than a delicious and authentic NC BBQ joint.",

    "text": "Very tasty meal. Order the beef brisket (mixed with both lean and fatty meat)! It's so delicious and oh so filling too! The ambience is very casual inside. There are booths and floor seating as well as a bar. Decorations are eclectic and exude an air of laissez faire in the face of eccentricity. Our servers were kind and wordy but not pushy. As I was from out of town (out of the country actually) I asked for the public wifi password, but that was unfortunately given to me incorrectly so I was stuck off the grid for the duration of the meal. About 10 minutes after our order was taken we were given our meals, rather more promptly than I expected (kudos to the pre-prepping work). With both our meals came pickled onions and hushpuppies. I had never had hushpuppies before, and I would say for my fellow Canadians who do not frequent the south, they are similar in texture and taste to Tim Hortons old fashioned donuts, without the glaze of course. I ate them with ketchup (which I don't with donuts I might add) and every bite was heavenly; reminded me of home - walking out the door in the blustery dawn, not a soul stirs in the frigid street, only sound heard was made by the crunching of my boots along the freshly fallen snow - I hope my car starts up today. It did and I race through the frozen tundra down the street to my neighbourhood Tim's and order a large double double with my favourite treat: that subtly sweet, dry but my not crumbling yet melt in your mouth pastry, the old fashioned donut.",

    "text": "I came with some friends on a weekend for dinner, and even at around 5 PM, the place was already starting to fill up.  Thankfully, we got a table for the 8 of us.    I ordered the burnt tips, since the description on the menu sounded so promising.  I ordered it with bacon wrapped jalepenos and baked beans as sides.  I got the large portion, but was a little disappointed at how small of an amount of meat it seemed to be.  But even placing that issue aside, the quality of the meat was disappointing.  I mean, burnt tips are my favorite part of brisket - I love the smokiness and depth of flavor the burnt-ness adds to the meat.  Therefore, I thought a whole plate of it would be heaven for me.  Maybe it's the fact that too much of a good thing can be a bad thing - Joey needs Monica just like awesome burnt tips need regular brisket.  They balance each other out.  Or maybe it's that my tips were chewy, dry, and at times hard to eat.  Regardless, I wasn't a fan of burnt tips on their own, and I wouldn't recommend getting it.  Joey just couldn't sustain his own show, right?  Oh, and there were only 3 bacon wrapped jalepenos (which tasted good) and the baked beans were just ok.   My wife got the pulled pork barbecue with a side of smoked veggies.  The barbecue was dry and so-so in flavoring.  It definitely needed the sauce to make it taste better.  And the veggies were not bad.  Our service was pretty friendly and fast, and they did a good job accommodating our table of 6 adults and 2 children.  I was just a bit underwhelmed by the food that we got.  It seemed like the friends we ate with enjoyed their ribs, though.  So maybe next time, that's what I'll try.",

He was without a doubt the most informative server that I have ever come across in my nearly 50 years of dining out. Matt explained to us about the smoker, the whiskey, the brisket, the different sauces, just everything! He was awesome! He even brought us out a sample of brisket and the sauces to try out to help us decide on what to order. The brisket was phenomenal and my husband went with ordering the fatty style brisket and added on the burnt ends. He shared, of course, and OMG! Heaven in your mouth! Best brisket I have ever eaten! Definitely order the fatty brisket as it will literally melt in your mouth! I ordered a rack of ribs and they were the best ribs that I have had since moving to NC three years ago, and we have tried many, many ribs down here! I shared as well and STILL brought home enough for us to have lunch the next day! The ribs were soooo good that you do not even need any sauce but I did still dip a few in because their sauces are delish too! I couldn't decide which sauce I liked better so Matt brought me all 4 on the side! How cool is that!!! For dessert we split a banana pudding and it was fantastic! The texture was more like a fluffy mousse and it was so creamy and yummy! Just thinking about it is making my mouth water! This please was off the hook fantastic and we will definitely make this our go-to barbecue place!",

    "text": "Midwood Smokehouse opened its second location on May 7, 2015 in the Ballantyne neighborhood of Charlotte. It's in the old Sticky Fingers Smokehouse space at Toringdon Circle (shopping center). I visited this restaurant a couple weeks after it opened with a group of friends, two of whom make up two-thirds of the Barbecue Bros (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbarbecuebros.co%2F&s=aad79aa8027827aeca509541d93b0f3fb387d2ee1efd65543864491c8c2042fe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">barbecuebros.co</a>). We ordered a nice sampling of BBQ and enjoyed the experience. The food and service were good.  At 5:45pm on a Friday, the restaurant was already very busy. We were told by the hostess that our wait would be about 30 minutes. We were seated in about 20. There wasn't much space at the bar so we waited outside with others. By the time we left around 7:15pm, the number of folks waiting had grown quite large. There must've been at least a half-dozen groups/families waiting.  The inside of the restaurant resembles an American restaurant chain such as Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. The clean, open space features both a bar and dining room with a mixture of booths and tables. Our group of six sat in one of the circular bench-style booths by the windows. The interior sports several large TVs (great for watching sports), vintage North Carolina artwork and memorabilia, and artistic metal cutouts with a BBQ, farm, and kitchen theme.  I haven't been to Midwood Smokehouse's original location in Plaza Midwood, but I was told by my tablemates that that location is different in look and feel. This location in Ballantyne is designed for the suburbs. There's plenty of parking too.  The BBQ served here is influenced from various styles from the Carolinas to Texas. Aside from the standard sandwiches and plates, Midwood Smokehouse also serves salads, tacos, and appetizers like Pimento Cheese Fries, Fried Pickles, and Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos. Expect to spend about $8-10 each for most sandwiches (includes a side) and about $10-18 each for most plates. Plates come in both small and large sizes.  We went with the following:  BBQ: * Burnt Ends (small, $13.50) - crispy caramelized cubes of brisket tossed in a housemade Fat Tire BBQ sauce * Combo Platter (\"Well-Fed,\" $22), which came with: * Carolina Chopped Pork - hickory-smoked chopped pork lightly dressed in Eastern NC vinegar sauce * Beef Brisket (both fatty and lean) - Texas-style sliced beef brisket served in natural juices * Smoked Sausage - combination of beef, pork, and garlic * Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs (dry) - smoked  Apps & Sides: * Hushpuppies (whole basket, $5) - scratch-made, slightly sweet and warm, served with BBQ sauce * Collard Greens * Classic Mac & Cheese * BBQ Slaw  I liked everything. The food had simple presentation and was served in old-fashioned plates and bowls with floral decorations akin to something you'd expect to find at your grandma's house.  The Burnt Ends were rather tender and flavorful. They were more tender than I was expecting. A good bit of sauce, flavor (sweetness), and caramelization. These were probably my favorite of the BBQ meats. The Carolina Chopped Pork was on par with other chopped pork I've had around the state. Moist and tasty, the meat was smoked with hickory logs from North Carolina.  You have the option of ordering the Beef Brisket fatty, lean, or both. We got both and the brisket was delectable. Smoky with an appetizing chew and consistency. The Smoked Sausage was A-OK. Plump and glistening, it was charred on one side and had firm texture and bite. The Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs were excellent. Near \"fall off the bone,\" the somewhat fatty meat and rub were packed with delicious flavor. Note the ribs are available with sauce as well.  BBQ sauces at the table included South Carolina Mustard, Eastern NC Vinegar, Midwood Signature, and Habanero. My favorite was the subtly sweet Midwood Signature, but really, none of the BBQ needed any sauce. The meats tasted fine without it.  The Hushpuppies were small and soft, almost squishy. They weren't crispy nor crunchy, but had comparatively smooth centers. The Collards, with bits of pork, were alright as was the BBQ Slaw. When it comes to slaw, you can order both mayo-based \"Coleslaw\" or the NC traditional vinegar-based \"BBQ Slaw\" (a.k.a. red slaw), finely chopped. The Mac & Cheese was great. Made with elbow macaroni, it was nice and cheesy with small, chewy bits of hardened, charred cheese. It was moderately oily, but lots of good mac 'n cheese are greasy.  Service was terrific. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time and I was impressed with how our server remembered our food and drink orders after we'd changed our minds and switched them up on her. Kudos. Founder/owner Frank Scibelli personally checked on our table. Midwood Smokehouse plans to open more locations including one in Columbia, SC.  If you like BBQ, these guys are worth checking out.",

Maybe it's not as authentic as like, a shack in the woods or something but since I have no experience to compare it to, I just have to say, it was great.  Hot, tasty, reasonably priced, and a fun atmosphere.  This is for the south Charlotte location. First, it was already super busy on a Saturday night and they let us book a reservation about 40 minutes before we got there. The table was waiting for us when we arrived. Our server was friendly, attentive, and happily answered 20 questions from a bbq newbie (me).  He brought us a bunch of extra sauces and always kept our drinks filled.  The (beef) burnt ends were amazing, and it seems like each entree is enough for two people.  Mac & cheese, the bomb.  The food came out fast, but not so fast that we couldn't finish our appetizer first. 100% will go again.",

    "text": "I've been to the Midwood Smokehouse's original location in Plaza Midwood but with the help of my dinner group, we met at this new location because parking is easier.   They took over an old Sticky Fingers location so it has the feel of a family style restaurant rather than the funkiness of the original location.  Our server indicated she was new and she did well despite some challenges. She knew the rotating beer selections which was plus. She told us at first they were out of ribs but then asked how many of us wanted ribs and went back into the kitchen to see how many were available and we were in luck. So a big plus for that.   But parts of the service fell flat. The first part goes to the bar staff.  3 of us ordered the same beer, NoDa's Ramble on Red. Another person arrived later and ordered a Stella and her beer arrived almost immediately.  We waiting close to 30 minutes for the NoDa beers. It was almost like they had to drive up to NoDa and pick up another keg. Thanks to our server for at least following up with them a few times.   Another flaw came with the ordering. One person at our table ordered their meal with cole slaw and sweet potato fries as their sides and they brought out two sides of the fries. After notifying two servers, there were then almost duplicates of cole slaw. So the wait staff seems a bit frazzled here. Is everyone new??  As for food, I had the ribs and they were tender and sauced just right with additional sauce for dipping.  The mac n cheese was amazing! The hush puppies were a bit dry and hard.  So I'd come here for the food but you might want to stick with soft drinks until the bar staff gets their act together.",

My boyfriend and I are visiting Charlotte from Philly and were really excited to eat at Midwood but she ruined the ENTIRE experience. She does not need to be in customer service. She started off being very rude to us from the time we sat down. We switched tables because it was too cold and her exact words to greet us was \"let's try this again, my name is \"Audrey\" and I'm gonna be your server.\" Well it only got worst from there. I ordered Sprite to drink, which tasted like Seltzer water so I asked her to please change it. She told me this is the only sprite we have so do you want something else - clearly Audrey. Clearly. We asked for meal recommendations (it's our first time here!) and she said \"well everything is good, I can't recommend any one thing over another.\" Oh ok Audrey. Thanks! . After ordering, not once did she check on us. My boyfriend had to go ask someone else for a refill bc who knows where she was. The food was OK, which is another reason for this poor review. The fries were cold. The mac and cheese was hard and cold. The brisket was dry. The hushpuppies were awesome though. Nevertheless, do better Audrey! Do better Midwood!",

I knew right away with the unfriendly hostess, that acted like we were an inconvenience that something was amiss.  Then just ok food - real quick, but luke warm, like it was just sitting in back pre- cooked. Plus, skimpy on pours, like the bartender just wants to empty the  remaining part of the bottle and not open a new one? Being cheap doesn't impress customers, just has them go to the next place. It is not like you have good prices? So if service or attitude is not good why patronize? Staff and manager just going through the motions, they walk around but no focus on customers.",

The food  I ordered the ribs and they were good but nothing special.  I was really hoping for better but they were nothing to write home about.  I heard that the original place is better so maybe next time I will try their other location. My sides again were solid but nothing special.  The service We had a group of 10 and our waitress was great she was very kind and attentive.

    "text": "Midwood BBQ Bar was suggested to us as it is quickly becoming a BBQ institution in Charlotte. We had the pleasure of dining there at their Ballyntyne location on New Years Day for dinner.   North Carolina and Charlotte in general have a lot of BBQ restauarants. Most are very average. Some pulled chicken or pork smothered in copious amounts of some mysterious red sauce so you can't even tell if the meat was actually good ! That is NOT the case here at Midwood. For starters they only use hickory wood to smoke their meats in a one of a kind old school manual commercial smoker.  Someone has to feed the smoker constantly to keep the fire going and maintain a even temperature in the smoker at all times. That takes a lot of work . More art than science and it shows in their food.We started with some smoked wings. dry on the outside but moist and flavorful inside. My daughter chose the kids pulled pork sandwich w/sweet potato fries. She loved it ! They have a wonderful taco selection {yup, tacos at a BBQ spot !} You have a choice of 3 . All were fresh and yummy. The baked mac and cheese disappeared promptly also ! I had a new years special that is not normally on their menu. Pork shoulder , collards and black eyed peas. All for good luck to start 2017. Their extensive cocktail and bourbon/whisky list made a choice rather difficult. My hubby kept it classically simple with a Makers Mark 46 and Ginger Ale.   Service was prompt, informative and friendly. The manager demanded we try some brisket before we departed , so we managed to try a few bites. WOW ! tender, tasty and perfect mix of lean and fat.Midwood is now our \"GO TO \" spot when we are in Charlotte and craving REAL BBQ !",

I asked why we never got a drink period and she said she'd get a manager. Just a real \"BITCH\"!  We had an angry exchange. The manager was trying to be helpful but the damage was done. If she worked for me I would have fired her on the spot! Absolutely awful. My grandson knows the owner and I will write to him to make him aware. Really bad experience!",

We actually wanted dessert! But ok, fair enough, we'll pass on dessert..... She saw we still had food on our plates about 10 mins in and she asked if we wanted boxes. I thought for sure that I was on a hidden camera show... Are you kidding me? She tried to offer a box for our toddler and almost took his half eaten food away to clear the table. How bizarre!!! The place wasn't packed with tables waiting either - it wasn't even noon. We were so put off that we were rushed out that we can guarantee we won't be back for quite sometime. Waiting tables is NOT about rushing customers out the door. I was disappointed and can only hope this young woman gets coached - tips and \"regulars\" come from good service AND good food.

This from the one place where you could always order anything dry knowing that the flavor of the rub and smoke would shine through. Not so today.   On top of that, there aren't any bottles of BBQ sauce on the table to sample from. You have to ask for it and they basically have only three sauces (regular, vinegar and mustard).   Maybe I'll need to go back to the original location on Central. I'm hoping that they bring back the flavor. Even if it means a longer wait.",

    "text": "This was my second, and likely last, visit to this restaurant.  On my first visit last year, I ordered a half-chicken.  It was burnt on the outside, fairly dry on the inside, and really did not have much taste.  Tonight I tried to get my standard order when I visit a barbecue restaurant:  a sliced bbq sandwich with hush puppies.  Much to my surprise, the restaurant does not serve sliced bbq.  Really?  This is NC, the self-proclaimed bbq capital of the South.  I realize that most folks prefer their bbq chopped.  That said, this is the first bbq restaurant that I have EVER been to in NC that didn't have sliced bbq as an option.  What a disappointment! So, I ordered the chopped chicken bbq plate, which came with one side and hush-puppies.  Just like my last visit, the chicken was dry and had very little flavor.  Even the SC version of mustard-bbq sauce that came with it could not save the chicken.  The five miniature-sized hush-puppies that came with the meal were bland and basically tasteless.  The only redeeming feature of the meal was the macaroni and cheese that I ordered as my side dish.  It was quite good.  Also of note was my server who provided excellent service.  But despite the server and the macaroni and cheese, I will pass this restaurant by the next time I am in South Charlotte and get a hankering for bbq.",

There are not many places that serve burnt ends, and it's worth going to Midwood just for that. Their smoked wings are really good, and the banana pudding is delicious.  The only problem is that it gets crowded and there is a wait during peak hours, but what else would you expect?",

The food and beer all came out within a reasonable amount of time, and the wait staff were friendly, even those rushed and being trained.  The pulled-pork with super tasty and warm - pink coloured, with a smokey undertone and NOT at all dry. The coleslaw and hush-puppies were a little too sweet for my liking, but each had a good crunch and good texture. Unfortunately I did not get enough BBQ source, (a bigger dish please) nor were they any to taste test on the tables.  The OMB Copper was ably poured by the bar staff and tasted wonderfully fresh and crisp. It could have done with being a fuller pint!  I am looking forward to returning. Easily the best BBQ in south Charlotte.",

I waltzed in, bypassed all the folks waiting for talbes, went to the Take-Out area on the right of bar,  paid, and walked out with my food.  It took longer for me to park than it did to get the food.  This is a staple in the \"list of restaurants to take guests to\".  Keep up the good work.",

I was promptly greeted as I walked in and I must say, I loved the vibe.  First impression was very good.  Out of the gate the service was on top of it.  Quick to say hello, welcome me, and even gave me a tour of the menu and some insightful knowledge into their smoking process.  I loved hearing that their smoker was custom made out of Mesquite, TX.  This must be the real deal.  I had to try the brisket as it's a hometown staple.  I have to say it brought me back.  I fell in love with Midwood at that point.  Service A+, Food A++.  Nice job Midwood.  See you again real soon.",
