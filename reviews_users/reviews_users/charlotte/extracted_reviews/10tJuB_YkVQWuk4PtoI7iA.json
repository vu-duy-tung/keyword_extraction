    "text": "Solid 4 stars... verging on 4.5 stars for Intermezzo!  I will definitely come back and try their other menu offerings.  A small group of us went on a chilly Thursday evening.  The bar regulars looked to be out in force but the dining room was pretty quiet.  It did pick up a little towards the end, but I did appreciate the cozy environment, the available art (for sale) on the walls, and the personable and nice service.  Definitely needed a martini to drown out the workday so I asked the barkeep/server if he had recommendations and he recommended the French Martini.  I had been eyeing it on the menu so that's what I went with.  For my dinner, I was determined to order some Serbian delight... and went with the Ground Beef Burek.  It was accompanied by a side of greens with a balsamic drizzle.  Super yummy... it was a big plate of food and I ate it ALL.  Unfortunately didn't have room for dessert based on my entree and my (multiple) martinis.  Overall a great place.  I'm already planning my return trip!  Side Note:  It also helps, being an avid tennis fan (and wannabe player) that the current #1 player in the world Novak Djokovic is Serbian.  Now I doubt this diet regime would include the items offered here to maintain his fitness, but I have no doubt he would totally be eating at Intermezzo whenever (if ever) he comes to Charlotte for some \"home\" cookin'.",

The waiter was very rude and ended up skipping our table a few times before he was stopped and asked when it would be our turn to order. He then proceeded to roll his eyes and put out a finger saying you wait a minute, then when the owner was approached about the waiters Behavior comma he was not any better. The owner as well was very rude to us, and told us that his waiter would never do something like that again and if we didn't like their service that we didn't have to come back. The owner was not apologetic about the staffs Behavior at all and the food was even worse. They portray themselves to be a Serbian restaurant but don't really have any authentic food. They serve more bar style Italian style type of food period with the service and the food this is one of the worst experience I've ever had going to a restaurant and will never do it again.",

I wish i would have ordered that!  I ordered the stuff peppers and they were ok. I expected a little more since the waiter talked them up so much but to me it was an ok dish. It basically was a pepper stuffed with beef and a small amount of rice with tomato sauce. Also, when I received my dish it was cold in the middle :( hopefully it will be better as leftovers at lunch today.",

Given the glowing reviews, we went and ordered the pizza and salad and were honestly a bit underwhelmed... the pizza was okay and the salad was humdrum & it's hard to drive past all of the amazing restaurants on Central and pass them up for something that we considered \"just okay.\"   Two weeks ago my opinion of Intermezzo changed for the better... we were invited to a friend's birthday dinner there and went because we love our friend (not because we wanted to eat at Intermezzo again)... our friend recommended that we order off of the Serbian menu and OH MY GOODNESS, the food we ordered was off the hook! My husband ordered a Piroska (a fabulous stuffed pizza dish) and I sampled the Chicken Frickasee... both were amazing.   Thanks to our much more exciting second trip to Intermezzo, there will definitely be subsequent visits -we'll just make sure we order off of the Serbian section of the menu from now on!",

My favorite is the Milanese pizza....omg yum! If you can't decide, they will do a half/half large pizza for you. We did the milanese/intermezzo supreme split...no regrets!!! WOOOH!

    "text": "The idea of a Serbian restaurant was enough to entice me to purchase the Groupon to check it out, especially since I had never really thought about what Serbian cuisine was about. We headed to Intermezzo before hitting up The Comedy Zone and walked away impressed with the place.  Intermezzo does not look like much from the outside, but don't let the old building and gravel parking lot scare you...they serve up some decent grub. The interior is pretty neat with exposed brick walls and shelves of all these little miniature toys. The interior dining area is small but not cramped, and the outdoor patio area looked to add a lot more space, weather permitting. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and got us going with our drinks. I got a draft of Founder's Porter ($5) and the miss' got a Cantaloupe Martini ($4.50 on a 1/2 off martini Saturday.)   For an appetizer we started with the Corn Dip ($8.75) which was a bit pricey for what you got. It was a small ramekin of corn niblets mixed with peppers, onions and cheese. The ramekin must have been placed in a salamander before coming out because the cheese topping crustified, much like a french onion soup would. Once we got everything mixed around it was pretty tasty paired with the tortilla chips, but it definitely wasn't $8.75 worthy. It was really surprising because the rest of the appetizers, and even the entrees, were reasonably priced, so I don't know what made a bunch of corn and cheese so expensive in comparison.  For dinner, after seeing all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I had to go with the Ground Beef Burek ($11.95.) It is a huge roll made of fillo dough, but not the fillo dough I'm used to. It was denser and crunchier than what I've had in Greek-style cheese pies and other foods, and it worked as a great exterior crust to the contents inside. It was filled with tons of a ground beef and onion mixture, and that was it. No sauce, no seasoning, just pure beef and sauteed onion. I think it was missing a little something initially, but I added some tzatziki sauce on top and that gave it a bit of umph it was initially missing. It also came with a decent-sized side salad of greens, tomato and cucumber with a balsamic dressing. The veggies were nice and fresh and the dressing had a nice sweetness to it.  The missus ordered the Cheese & Spinach Burek ($11.95) and I'm surprised to say that I liked hers more. The cheese consisted of ricotta so it was similar to a calzone filling, and the spinach was not obtrusive at all. In fact, I would go so far as to say that a burek that contained both ground beef and this cheese mixture would be a slam dunk hole in one home run goal.   Intermezzo is a pretty great restaurant that takes pride in their food. They also do pizzas and I am looking forward to returning in the near future to give them a whirl. Definitely worth checking out. One last note, I saw a guy running around doing deliveries so if you live nearby that may be a great option.",

The woman at the host stand told me the pizza is cooked on a conveyor oven.  Again that's not a bad thing, but you need to know what you're doing to make a conveyor oven pizza taste great.  Maybe the Serbian food is better, I'll have to come back and try something else.  My advice is to go elsewhere for pizza.",

He was very belligerent, snapped that the order was correct, and walked away.  Unfortunately when we got back home we discovered it wasn't correct... the sides were right but the meals were someone else's dinner. We spent $30+ for a meal my GF couldn't eat. To the owner's credit when I called and pointed out the mistake she replied quickly and corrected the issue.

    "text": "So I'm drafting this in the restaurant as we sit to eat dinner, so it doesn't get any more real or firsthand thoughts than this. I came here and invited some folks that. First things first. All my elites recommended the bruschetta, so we got both types cause it was half off.  Bruschetta: the first one I had was the one with basil. This one was good, and knowing that they make the mozzarella is something to mention. The basil taste I liked because it balanced the tomatoes. The second type of bruschetta was more tomato based, so that had more of that kind of flavor that I thought was okay.  I ordered the beef Burek and let's say its something new, it's sort of hard to explain but inside the bread it's stuffed with beef and onions. Not much taste, but it's different and I recommend you to get it. I feel like it lacked a sauce or something,  but it was good.  We also had the capriccioso pizza? I'm not sure if that's how you spell it, but it was delicious. I recommend any pizza, it wasn't overloaded with sauce at the same time it wasn't salty.   I also sampled the Wienerschnitzel that they had, which was pretty big. I recommend this dish. It's breaded pork served with a creamy sauce, topped with potatoes. The creamy sauce is a must though because if you don't it'll be a little dry.   Another dish we sampled was the Stuffed Cabbage, which was I say wasn't my favorite. It was sort of vinegary based, stuffed with beef and rice. It was sort of new, but not really that amazing in my opinion.  Inside is small and quaint. They have a full bar, no worries on getting drinks here! It's a casual type of restaurant, so no worries about what you wear. They have dining inside as well as outside, but outside has more seating. Our waiter was a girl named Veronica, who was very polite and nice.  I think I found a new place for pizza. And after looking at the pictures and reading this I hope I found you a new place to discover!",

Pick any from their list - you can't go wrong. - delicious traditional Serbian dishes (nothing healthy about 'em :) but so worth all the calories!) - comfortable, casual environment - super friendly staff - and they deliver to uptown!! so for those lazy evenings, when you're craving something delicious, you can order one of their perfectly created pizzas. i'm not sure if the magic is in the dough or in the sauce or toppings, but the pizzas are magical :)",

And I am both happy and sad I did the Piroska is real good.  Service atmosphere and over all menu worth the trip!",

    "text": "We went in on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see that it was pretty empty. We had looked at the menu online so we had an idea of what we wanted.  Our server seemed to have already had a bad day or something because he was unbearable. He seemed like he would rather be anywhere but there. They were out of the sarma which was a huge bummer because I really wanted to try it. We settled on a large pizza. The server kept trying to finish my sentences as I ordered and it was really irritating.  One thing I was confused about was the different pricing online and on the menu. The menu was priced at almost $2+ more than online. When I mentioned it to the server he said he would check on it...still waiting.  The pizza was good but not for $22. It had chicken, onions and cheese. Pretty overpriced for that thing. I figured I would be paying that amount for something phenomenal but the 99 cent pizza places in NYC beats their pizza. I loved the restaurant itself. The outside seating was great and the brick walls inside added something special to the decorative vibe.  3 stars for the decent pizza but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there again when I go back to Charlotte.",

A group of 7 of us came here after going to an event at The Filmore, and we were hangry for some carbs. Pizza you say? That sounds like an amazing idea. Intermezzo it is!  We were seated promptly at one of the tables in the patio (covered and heated, so we weren't frigid). The service was quick and really helpful, I ordered the personal size of the veggie pizza (Garden Fresh) that was loaded with broccoli, mushrooms, and other veggies and had...*gulp* smoked gouda cheese. Let me tell you, I haven't been more excited to eat leftovers since the last time I went to a japanese steakhouse. All pizzas at the table were excellent! I can't wait to go back and try more dishes from them, and experience the Serbian side of things. In the meantime, please go and try their pizza, yelp!",

My daughter had one of the best Chicken Francese dishes ever in a restaurant with a large, soft breaded chicken cutlet over a bed of delicious Rosemary seasoned mashed potatoes. My other daughter has a delicious mushroom pizza and I ordered the Ground Beef Burek (Filo Dough, Ground Beef, Onions) which frankly looked like baked intestines (with a similar concept, coiled tubes) but don't let that gross description dissuade you from ordering it, was quite delicious, also came with a nice salad and a cucumber like sauce on the side.  The portions were also very generous.  The outdoor seating was nice, but near a very busy intersection.  If I lived close by I would sample other items on the menu which seemed very appealing such as the stuffed cabbage and stuffed peppers.",

Every time I pass by, the restaurant is packed - at all times (always a good sign). Plus, I love discovering new places to eat and indulge.   As we walked into Intermezzo, a dimly light setting coupled with wooden booths greets us - very elegant for a \"pizzeria.\" Why the quotations, you may ask? When I surveyed the menu, to my surprise I found a list of Serbian Specialties. My eyes lit up and I am pleasantly surprised. Everything sounded delicious, but we locked down on a Smoked Gouda Burger and a traditional Serbian dish - Cheese and Spinach Burek. Both were delicious and I am excited to try the other Serbian dishes next time. Mission Eggplant Musaka is next!",

We were seated on the enclosed patio which felt isolated and unwelcoming, not to mention noisy from traffic and the blowing heaters. Our waiter is the reason for 1 star. He seemed annoyed when asked for a menu recommendation. Our food was brought by another server and our waiter never came back to check on us. Finally, my friend went in herself to ask for more water and a new fork for our table. The servers inside didn't even help her, so we had to wait even longer for our waiter to finally come back out and he did not even apologize and basically threw the new fork on the table. Terrible experience head to toe, will not come here again. Food was fine but not good enough to come back for that kind of experience.",

I've been blown away by beef short ribs and root veggies (and introduced to roasted radishes). I've had a bone-in pork chop worthy of happy tears. Others are probably glad for the occasional seafood weekend specials. But there's always a great option on the menu if it isn't a weekend night or the special isn't for you. I love that I can order a good beer or a nice glass of wine or a well mixed Manhattan and be pleased by any choice. Though the wine and beer lists aren't extensive, they have been well selected. Martinis are a specialty. Maybe the best thing here, whether in the cozy, exposed brick interior or on the large patio, is the staff. I am always made to feel so welcome here.",

I would say the restaurant has character, it's a unique spot.  Service is basically fine, though once or twice they seemed perhaps a little overwhelmed.  They maintained a good attitude, in any case.  The pizzas seem quite good to me, by current Charlotte standards: flavorful with fresh ingredients and a tasty, thin crust (wood fired?).  My frequent dining companion says good things about some soup they have, I think it's chicken and pesto (and I didn't know you could reasonably use pesto as a soup ingredient).  Another well-traveled friend did not have such high recommendation for their kebobs, unfortunately; I think he would describe them as \"run of the mill at best.\"  I will continue to visit this restaurant, on the strength of the pizza alone.",

I ordered an 20 oz and they brought me a 16oz glass with a 4 glass on the side and told me they are out of glasses and I accepted that.  The icing on the cake was when we ordered dessert it was the worst piece of crap I've ever tasted in my whole entire life.  I informed the waitress she went and told the manger, she returned telling me he is not going to remove from my bill.  I asked to see the manager she told me no, so I went looking for him.  I found him at the bar making drinks this guy basically confronts me saying I altered my order because I didn't want hazelnut cream on my dessert, therefore I cannot get a refund.  His rude a** then proceeds to over talk me not allowing me to get a word in.   Word of advise please do not eat @ this establishment unless you want to be treated like s***.   I guess that is how they do in Serbia",

    "text": "This is more than just another pizza place!!  I am tired of reading reviews calling this spot \"another Italian place\" for this could not be further from the truth. The owners of this interesting space are actually Serbian and the best dishes on the menu are Eastern European rather than Italian.  I assume most people are making this Italian reference due to the large pizza section on the menu. The pizza is pretty tasty and a good crowd pleaser but the real gems on this menu are the more unusual items. My hands down favorite item  is the Ground Beef Burek. This is house made phyllo dough stuffed with ground beef and onions and served with a cucumber sauce (similar to a chunky tzatziki sauce) and a salad. Now I admit this isn't the first thing that I thought about ordering but the server my wife and I had on our first visit almost insisted we try it. And I am very glad he did!! I am addicted to the Burek and eat it almost once a week! The menu also features a Spinach and Cheese Burek which is also very good. The Sarma (cabbage rolls) are also excellent as are the stuffed peppers. If you want something a bit lighter, the sandwiches, which are served on house made bread and toasted on a wood-fired grill, are great.   You will be hard pressed to find a restaurant in Charlotte with more house-made items, particularly at the price point offered at Intermezzo. Intermezzo makes their own bread, their own Mozzarella, and their own Phyllo dough (if there is another rest aunt in Charlotte making their own phyllo I would be surprised). Another reason this spot sticks out is their use of wood fired ovens, grills and stoves. And this place actually uses wood, rather than just saying it on their menu like some other local pizzerias (particularly ones that start with \"B\" and end with \"xx\").   If the food wasn't enough, there is a full bar, a limited but well selected beer and wine list, and some of the best drink specials in town. The only down side is the interior is small and if you are coming with more than 4 people you may have to sit on the patio or in separate booths. However, the awesome food if worth this small annoyance.   If you go to this gem in Charlotte be bold and look past the pizza, and make sure at least one person orders the Burek!!",

This is sad since they were amazing the first year.   Martini's were half off however it was poorly made, so we put it aside and ordered a different martini.  They charged us for the one they screwed up even though we didn't drink it!  I guess we have no complaints about the hummus since it tasted just like the one we normally get at Trader Joes, but the bread they served... cold and chewy.  Our server gave no eye contact and could care less if the cafe served something bad.  We left and went to the Fig Tree... which the food was amazing and the staff was great!",

I've eaten there twice in the last week and Nadia from our office has been there three times.  My first visit was a Friday night and the place was full.  We took a seat at the bar and Georgie the bartender was full of energy and personality .... and served us dinner.  I had the Boureck (spelling) which is a ground meat mixture in a pastry crust that was delicious. Served with cucumber sauce and a great little salad.  My boyfriend had the lamb mixture hamburger which is served on a fresh made pita type bread.   His was so big he could barely eat it all.  The next trip we had an appetizer plate of meats and artichoke hearts and cheese.  It looked small but it was delicious.  Then we split the moussaka which was different than any I've ever had.  The eggplant was lightly fried and stacked with a meat blend and a chunky tomato sauce... yummm.   Nadia recommends the grilled veggie sandwich... she said that was the best she's every had! This restaurant is a great addition to a terrific neighborhood.  Oh... if you go on a nice night you can sit outside and have a terrific city light view.",

    "text": "First let's start off with the service. Waitress Julie B. was awesome. She was very warm and very quick on the welcome. She gave us our menus and our drinks were on the table in seconds. She gave us a little time to check out the menu then came to our rescue to tell us the best things to get. Boy was she ever spot on.   My wife and I started off with the Intermezzo Salad with the balsamic vinaigrette. I don't know about you, but I am not a salad eater, but this salad I could eat all day long. The sweet vinaigrette, and the home made mozzarella really set that badboy off. Julie then ran off a list of her favorite items until we told her to stop at the pizza. We ordered half capriccioso and half intermezzo, and from then on it was nothing but lip smacking and finger lickin. I have had pizzas in NY, Chicago, SF and plenty of other places in the US, but this little corner restraunt in Charlotte is the best I have ever tasted. I'm not just saying this, try it for yourself. The crust was perfect;y crispy and not too thin, nor too thick. They make the dough by hand, and all of the ingredients are fresh. You can taste the freshness as if you were in the garden when they pick  the basil and tomatos. After we downed the pizza it was dessert time. We got the crepe with bananas, strawberrys, and hazelnut choclate sauce and that immediately put me in heaven and didn't want to come down.   If you haven't been to this little hole in the wall spot, then please go. You will be back. You will find yourself forgetting about Papa John's.",

We went back again the following weekend for a girl's night and it was just as good as the week before. On Saturdays they have  1/2 price martinis...you can't beat that! Everyone at the table had something different off the menu and everyone was more than happy with their choices. I will say the goat cheese appetizer and the corn dip appetizer were both amazing...we got them both weekends. Of all the places I have eaten in Charlotte, this place has one of the best atmospheres. It is so warm and welcoming inside and I can't wait to sit out on the patio this spring. Oh and definitely try the mint chocolate chip martini...I had it for dessert and it was AMAZING!",

Not to mention the fact that if this place was not as great as it was hyped on Yelp, my friends would have killed me or made me pay for the food. I must say that the place lived upto the Yelp's  reviews.  Ambiance was great, very casual.  Good music... Good service,  the server (who was great, very excited about this job)  suggested 2  pizzas, both of them, were  AWESOME !!  So thanks for the server..  We had chicken florentine (without bacon) and  Garden Fresh. The pizza were great,  made us think why we order Pizzahut pizza.  I found this place to be better than Brixxx.  They do home delivery in 3 mile radius, too bad, I dont live in that radius.   The crowd was also good .. not noisy ...  there was a waiting for a place indoor.  Do not visit this place,  you might cause to this place to get famous and make it crowded ....  just kidding ... do visit.  it is nice place.",

The menu said the food is Serbian and since I've never had Serbian food (nor could I point out Serbia on a map), my friend suggested I try a dish.  I ordered the Spinach and Cheese Burek and was extremely pleased.  It's enormous and comes with a delightful side salad made of mixed greens... scrumptious.  Their homemade filo dough was the lightest and fluffiest ever, coupled with warm warm spinach and cheese... this dish definitely brought a smile to my face.  I went on a Saturday night so the martini's were 1/2 priced (originally they range from $8-10).  I had a dirty martini (yummy!), a Pink Lady (very strong and made with tequila), a Pamarita (pomegranate... two thumbs up) and the Espresso Martini (I still have dreams about this one).  I also recommend the Mint Chocolate Chip martini which tastes like ice cream.  Of course when I went we were on a girls night out so it was a perfect place but I also recommend visiting this place for date night or when you're just looking for someplace cool to hang.  It's not too loud, the lighting is a little moody and the staff is very friendly.  This is a must visit in Charlotte.",

It was good; however, nothing about it resembles a tower; more like a short stack.    Next, I ordered the Gouda Burger.  The flavor was decent but the pita bread bun made it hard to keep the sandwich together and about one-quarter into my meal I bit down on a piece of wood.  The waitress initially attributed it to them grounding their own meat; I didn't follow her logic.  I tried to give the burger one more try before I bit down on some gristle and decided I could take no more.   My side of roasted potatoes tasted like they were roasted a week earlier so I had it replaced with a salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette tasted like olive oil; there was no hint of balsamic vinegar or spices.   The waitress came back and explained that the wood was from the wood grill they cooked the burger on. Ah-ha!  That makes sense but it's still disgusting and the owners may want to consider replacing their grill.  By the way, they did not charge me for the burger.    My sister ordered the veggie lasagna.  It was edible but very bland.    At any rate, I left very dissatisfied, nauseous and determined to never eat at Intermezzo again.",

Since then, each trip to the restaurant or online order has been progressively more disappointing. The majority of the wait staff is visibly irritated with customers and is inattentive even on a night when the restaurant is basically empty. On one occasion, we took company there and our waitress came to the table maybe twice the whole night. She forgot to put in a dessert we ordered to go so we sat for close to 20 minutes waiting while she stood in the back on her phone. I finally asked someone else and they couldnt find the order. Another time we ordered online and the bartender gave our friends attitude when he couldnt locate the order despite a confirmation email and a name given. Seemed annoyed to have to do his job. The hostess has been unhelpful and unfriendly on several occasions. There seems to be a pattern of genuinely good food being ruined by staff who just doesnt care and treats people like crap. I really hope the manager/owner does something about this.",

My dad and I went here one night because we love to try out the restaurants featured on DDD. We were confused and intrigued by the combination of Italian and Serbian, but willing to give it a try.   In terms of the split, they have a list of apps that pull from both cuisines. Then a list of about 10 pizzas - which were freakin' amazeballs, we got the capriccioso - a handful of Serbian entrees (we are Armenian so that was a real treat), a list of about 5 different pasta dishes, and an EXTENSIVE \"martini\" list. The martinis are really just cocktails, but still delicious in their own right. On the consumables front they get straight A's.   Also, our waiter Steve was so great. He went above and beyond great customer service and genuinely seemed enthusiastic about working there. He also was the perfect balance of helpful, attentive, and giving us some space. I'm not sure if all the wait staff is of the same caliber, but either way the food is more than worth it.   The only down side I would say is that it is very small. We went pretty late on a Wednesday evening, so we didn't have to worry much about crowds. But I can definitely see this place filling up quickly on Saturdays for the $5 martini special.",

The establishment was beautifully decorated/integrated into the original brick building, and the ambience was similar to some of the culinary gems I've stumbled across in Europe.  The music was kind of an eclectic mix of smooth electronic/trip hop, (Think Massive Attack, Zero Seven, Beats Antique, ect...) and a nice compliment to the overall Euro vibe they had going on.    Our waiter was very friendly too, and knowledgeable about the Serbian food selection.  I ended up choosing the stuffed peppers, and they did not disappoint!  The use of yellow bell peppers and a sweet and tangy pepper sauce made the dish light and refreshing. Stuffed peppers can be heavy sometimes if the balance of ground beef, rice, and veggies is off, but Intermezzo's proportions were perfect.  Presentation was beautiful too, and the serving size generous enough to not think twice about spending $15 on an entree.   Will definitely be back again, as they've got a pretty chill bar setup, and raving reviews for their sarma!",

    "text": "This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" takes us back to the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte, to a restaurant recently featured on Food Network's \"Diners, Drive ins and Dives,\" Intermezzo Pizzeria and Cafe. This European style restaurant serves hand-tossed pizza and traditional Serbian dishes. It reminded me of some of the cafes we visited on our past trips to Europe.   Dora here. Yeah, especially the cozy interior with brick exposed walls and only a smattering of tables and booths surrounding a hearth-like bar. But they don't need many interior tables with this generous outdoor patio!  After DDD's feature, I was all set to order the cabbage rolls (Sarma), but they were out. So, at the waiter's helpful recommendation, I ordered Karadjordjeva, a ham and cheese schnitzel breaded and pan fried, served with skillet potatoes and tartar sauce, although not the typical American tartar sauce, with a definite hint of dill. Similar to Cordon Bleu, but elevated a few notches, especially with the drizzle of lemon on the top.   Dora here. I ordered the Burek, ground beef and onions baked in Fillo dough. An unusual combination, right? But isn't it beautiful? Nothing spicy or too complex. After a few bites what came to mind was comfort food, much like Mac 'n Cheese is to Americans. Between Ernie and I, we finished off the whole thing. Didn't touch the salad, but that cucumber mixture made for a nice dipping sauce.  I'd definitely order the Karadjordjeva again, but I'd also like to try the Sarma or the Piroska. And the pizza...  Dora here. Guess that means we'll be going back. lol  We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.

    "text": "Okay, so I was skeptical about this place when we moved to Plaza Midwood 2 years ago.  We tried to eat there twice, but have up because each time the wait was ridiculously long and it didn't feel like it was worth it. Then one night, we decided to order take-out.  Holy moly!!! Best decision ever.  Take-out is almost never as good as when the food is served fresh in front of you, but everything we ordered was phenomenal!  I had pasta carbonara, which was really good.  We have ordered pizza and/or pasta from here several times since then, and each time the food has been spot on!  Surprisingly awesome place, highly recommended!",

We were celebrating a birthday and started out at a booth but people kept joining us and we had to add chairs. The server was accommodating and friendly, never made us feel we were asking too much. I've tried several things on the menu but now I always order the ground beef burek. It's so delicious!! A Serbian dish with ground beef and onions, wrapped in phyllo dough. It came with cucumbers in a tzatiki sauce and a small salad. Heavenly. If you want an appetizer the bruchetta is always a hit, and I also recommend the crepes for dessert.",

I Highly recommend this dish, you won't be disappointed.  Ordered dessert this time around. The Crepes...

Literally took 5 mins for our drink order and another 10 mins for our actual order. I think the server had tables inside and outside the patio. Drinks were never filled or asked if we wanted more drinks at the bar. Food took forever, over 30 mins. Other than that, the food is good for the most part and depending on your server, you might get good or bad service.",

I didn't try his veggie lasagna, bc we were already eating dinner together and it seemed fruity to do so! I'm insecure ;]  Food was delicious.  It tasted very good and served in reasonable portions.  It definitely had a home-cooked feel to it which for some reason always hits the belly a little better than \"restaurant\" food.  It was like fireworks going off in my mouth - the way the melange of flavors were distinct, yet blended well.  One word to describe it would be: Elegant - defined as \"simple but genius\"  Service was attentive and informative.  I didn't even finish my diet Coke, I mean, Coke Zero (manlier) and server had my next one ready (kinda just had to drink it bc it was prepared)  How did this place miss out on 5 stars?  Dishes were slightly overpriced. Slight meaning like $1 or $1.50 overpriced.  Will I come here again? Absolutely.  I recommend it highly as it is a perfect blend of home-cooked and deliciousness.  Parking lot sucks - it's gravel ;/  dmo out",

We started with the portabello mushroom tower. It was somewhat of a disappointment in portion size - for $9, you get a tiny serving with maybe 2 mushrooms. The goat cheese is delicious but I don't think this was worth the money.  We wanted to try True Serbian cuisine. I got the Becka Snicla (Wienerschnitzel) - Breaded Pork Tenderloin, Skillet Potatoes, Creamed Spinach. The spinach was a little too peppery, and the pork tenderloin was rather dry. I think it needed a slice of cheese or some marinara sauce. It was also lukewarm in temperature, as if it had been sitting out for a while. My husband got the Piroska (Balkan Style Stuffed Pizza), which was much better than my dish. It is very similar to a calzone, and stuffed with ricotta and mozzerella cheese and with sour cream on top. Our waitress wasn't overly friendly either.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed by the experience here, and not sure I would recommend it!",

My husband had the cabbage rolls. Both were amazing. I stole a bit of the fresh made pita that came with the cabbage rolls to sop up the wonderful sauce that covered my pasta. I didn't want to waste a drop. It was everything we expected and more. We will definitely be back. I would like to try the recommended pork chops and work through the pizza menu.",

Upon opening it, I noticed it was a very tiny portion, which is NOT usual.  I have been ordering here for 7 years, and have never had this issue.  I called just to let them know it was a little disappointing, but still delicious.  The owner drove BACK to my house herself and delivered another one free of charge.  You never get quality service like that anymore.  I was so thrilled and surprised.  My favorite place in Charlotte still, now even more.  They truly care about their customers.",

    "text": "Intermezzo is a small, intimate restaurant with a steady cast of bartenders/servers.  You feel like you're walking into a friend's restaurant each time you walk through the door.  There is a small bar that seats 10 or fewer - this is my favorite place to sit - a patio that is heated in the winter and then a dining room with a small nook near the bar.  It's a unique and charming venue.  While many people (including me, sometimes) order the pizza at Intermezzo, their Serbian food is really where the menu shines.   Going in, you should be aware that this is not light food - it's hearty, stick with you, comfort food.   The piroska is outstanding - essentially a Serbian calzone.  The becka snickla - pork tenderloin cutlet with potatoes and creamed spinach - is so very tasty.  I recommend spreading the creamed spinach - which I could eat by the bucketful - on the pork tenderloin.  I also recommend the eggplant musaka - ask for an extra side of the marinara - it's addictive.  I really don't think you can go wrong - and, if you're not sure, just ask your server - they're very knowledgeable and helpful.  The bar offers a few wines by the glass and about about 8 beers on tap that rotate.  If you're going to have more than 4 people, call ahead and see about reserving a table.",

I asked for a Bev nap from the bar and she said I couldn't have one because  they are too expensive but I could have a C fold towel. Can you believe that? Atmosphere is extremely dark and dirty on a bright summer day, yet if you want to sit on the patio you literally have to sit under the heat of the kitchen exhaust fan. It's completely absurd. The food is bland and comes with a blob of aged salad. Tables and seats in the booths are sticky. I can get a burrito with sour cream anywhere (aka Serbian pirotska)  nothing special. Highly do not recommend :(",

Took a little bit  to get our appetizer but then we learned this is truly a farm to table restaurant. Everything is fresh made. They have no freezers in the restaurant. I'm telling you it was the best marinara I've ever had.. for a small place they have a great draft beer list including 2 high gravity ones tonight.. I'm still in awe as to how great our meal was. As for all the triple D places we've ate at in Charlotte.. this one definitely is the best ever!! Hands down!!",

It is clear when you get your food that it's home made here and not a chain. We got a supreme pizza. Huge and hand tossed. Fresh toppings enough for 4 and still brought some home  In a past visit we got the Sarma. Served in a light sauce. Wanted it again but was sold out. The becka snicia is very European and also good but order lots of lemons to give it more flavor and moisture  Parking can be a little tough when busy Worth a try, really good food",

I went on a Saturday afternoon with my mom. The bartender/server was very friendly. He was as fast as he could be, considering he was the only one on staff. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich w/ grilled veg & my mom got a veg pizza. She let me try some of her pizza, which was quite delectable. I really enjoyed the crunchy crust, no doubt a result of the wood-burning stove. My food on the other hand was not so impressive. I should've gone with my first instinct & ordered pizza, but hey ya live ya learn. The sandwich was average at best, a little on the dry side. The biggest disappointment was the grilled veg. Throwing some zucchini & onion together just doesn't cut it guys.",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to try this establishment on a rainy friday evening. Parking was iffy but we managed to find a spot. It was nice to see so many patrons. That is always a good sign.  We had to wait just 10 min or so to be seated and my only complaint here is the lack of a comfortable waiting area. Small gripe though. While waiting we were able to watch plenty of food coming out of the kitchen (which looked great) and everyone seemingly having a good time.   We were ultimately led to a small table outside. This is where the service starts to slip. It took far too long for someone to get our drink orders. I think they were just understaffed that night. Moving on...  We couldn't decide what we wanted but finally settled on the goat cheese crostini and a large pizza (I confess I cannot remember which one). The appetizer had great flavor and the bread was clearly made with care. My date liked it so much she ate the crusty edges I discarded.  As for the pizza...fantastic! The crust was nearly perfect with a slightly crispy exterior and a light and chewy interior. The amount of sauce was perfect and it was very fresh tasting and tangy. The cheese and toppings were clearly of above average quality and used appropriately. My date said best pizza she has had in charlotte...but there are others to try. Says a lot that it is her benchmark. I still think Portofinos is its equal if not a different style of pizza altogether.  Will I return? Without a doubt. I want to try some of the Serbian entrees. Yelp did not let me down this time.",

Like some other Italian style Charlotte restaurants, this one isn't run by Italians, but Eastern Europeans - which has resulted in a great pizza menu (haven't branched out yet) and some unique offerings, like a Balkan stuffed pizza. I haven't tried it yet - I keep telling myself \"next time,\" but I haven't been able to get away from the mushroom or spinach pizzas. The kabob was only so-so (my husband got it once) but we were back a week or two ago and they've cut it from the menu.   GREAT drink specials on Saturdays (half off their martini list) and Wednesdays (half off mixed drinks, top shelf liquors) and they have some excellent - and varied - choices for beer on draft. Everybody's friendly and the prices are good.  Occasionally there are too many servers, in my experience - they loiter around next to the bar waiting for work. (I have only been here in the winter, though...summer might be a different thing.) Overall, one of my new favorite places for a night out.",

Nonetheless, if the food is good, that will overcome the decor.  There were at least 4 open tables in a relatively small restaurant.  As she was talking to another patron, the waitress told me to sit anywhere I wanted.  She promptly took my drink order and after about 10-15 minutes, and again not many patrons in the restaurant, she never came back.  I have limited time for lunch so I had to leave.  I will never go back to this place. There are too many other good restaurants in town that really want new business.  Obviously, this is not one of them.  I eat lunch out every day, and tell everyone that I know my experiences.  I am writing this email to help others avoid wasting their time.",

    "text": "We went last Friday after hearing such good things about this place.  It smelled fantastic when we got inside, and the place was packed, so I figured we would be in for a great meal, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  We ordered the roasted red pepper bruschetta as an appetizer.  First thing we noticed were the canned red peppers.  It was obvious they were canned and not fresh.  Fresh ingredients are so easy to prepare and make such a difference.  I am not sure why they would use canned red peppers, but it was disappointing.  Second, the bottom was black.  It was burned bad.  It was basically cheesy bread (same stuff you can get at Dominos) with canned red peppers.  It was awful.  For entrees, I had the Beef Burek and my fiancee had the margherita pizza.  The Burek didn't taste bad, but it was completely boring.  It was dough filled with beef spiced with onions and garlic.  That's it.  No sauce, nothing.  It was horribly dry.  I didn't know if this is how it was traditionally served, since I have never had Burek before, but it was awful as well.  The pizza was probably the best thing we ordered, and even it was terribly bland.  Just no taste at all.  We had to cover it in crushed red pepper just to get some flavor out of it!  We were both pretty upset because we had heard such good things about this place, and everyone else there seemed to be enjoying their meal, but ours was just awful.  Its probably safe to say we will not be returning.",

My favorites are the Spinach and cheese borek (although this is the Serbian version of the Greek spanakopita which is what I grew up on), the pizza with Ham & Onion, the bean soup and of course the crepes! Best crepes in CLT! The only thing that they need is more tables and paved and more parking.  Other than that it is a great restaurant.",

It was a beautiful day so we sat outside. At first the beeping from the crosswalk was annoying, then they turned on some music and it sort of drowned it out and it was not really an issue.   Food-wise, it was good. We went with the Piroska (calzone-like thing) and a spinach pizza. The Piroska was pretty good with mushrooms, ham, mozzarella and ricotto cheese. The spinach pizza was okay, we thought it was a little bland overall.   Our server was excellent and friendly.   Overall, nothing that would make me want to return right away, but it was good.",

Not many tables inside, but more seating is available on the patio when weather permits.  We came here on a Saturday night last winter. Every table was full, so we sat at the bar. The pizza looked great, but we wanted to try Serbian dishes.  The bartender (owner?) was friendly and fun and helped us decide what to eat.  We started with the shopska salad. Tomatoes were not in season, and the bartender apologized for that, but the salad was dressed well and the feta cheese (sheep's milk) was delicious. Then we ordered and split the spinach burek and cabbage rolls - hearty, hot, wonderful flavors. Both were really great and the sauces were incredible. The bread was dense and crusty.  I think this is a special place and I would love to go back! It will be hard to not order that same meal all over again ...",

We opted for inside since the pollen is AWFUL right now.  Julie waited on us.  The menu didn't have any kids items but she told me that they are happy to make kids pasta with sauce or butter or cheese (or all of the above.)  She got my daughters order in immediately so she wouldn't starve.    I had a pizza and my wife had blackened chicken pasta.  We all loved what we got.  I'm talking DELICIOUS.  And Julie was awesome and kept our drinks refilled.    Overall i would rate it as one of our favorites.",

Not only does Intermezzo have a great patio, with plenty of fans mind you, they sport a cozy interior and a really unique menu of pizzas and Serbian items I haven't indulged in before. I popped in here for a quick lunch with a friend and while I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich, I had a severe case of food envy when I saw my friend's dish come out - the ground beef burek. It looked like a pretzel roll and a beef slider had a baby. And she was quite pleased with it too!  Onto my sandwich, two pieces of delicious crusty bread hugged wood fired squash, portabella mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes. The best part though? The incredible goat cheese spread that was thinly layered beneath the veggies - I would like that in a cup, please. I chose the roasted potatoes as my side - nice and toasty, with a pleasant crisp. Prices and service were both friendly and I definitely want to head back and try a myriad of their Serbian dishes. And maybe a pizza. Times two.",

    "text": "Many thanks to Yelp for introducing me to a restaurant I likely never would have ventured to otherwise!   The reviews for Intermezzo were great, so my expectations were high. I met 2 friends here on one of those uncharacteristically warm, still technically winter, Charlotte days, just to give you an idea of the perfection I had ingrained in my mind.   Intermezzo did NOT disappoint. It met my high standards, and then some. As I waited for my friends to arrive, I caught a whiff of, what I believe was the Garlic Braided Twist appetizer. Must try them next time. They smelled UNREAL.   We began with the antipasto plate and Portobello Mushroom Tower. They were both great! I loved the assortment of meats and cheeses, and the goat cheese on the Mushroom Tower was so creamy and just, perfect really. Next time, I will ask for a bread basket.   I ordered the Sarma (Cabbage Rolls) as my entree. With all of the amazing sounding Serbian dishes on the menu, I figured, do as the Serbians do! I may as well have licked my plate.   One friend ordered a pizza. She raved! I was too busy wolfing down Sarma and my other friend's food to get a bite. The other dish I tried was the Blackened Chicken Pasta. The menu's description doesn't sound that enticing, but I was in chili powder heaven. It was subtly spicy, smoky, creamy, rich...   Ok--remind me not to write restaurant reviews when I haven't had my lunch. GO TO INTERMEZZO!",

We didn't even wander inside.  I wish I'd known that dining inside is a completely different experience.  This time around I loved Intermezzo!  The atmosphere was very cool and cozy and had that Plaza Midwood feel.  They have cool local art work on the brick walls and they had kind of a funky music playlist that half the time included rave/techno ish music and the rest of the time was more low key alternative.  I don't know if it was just because I was starving, but I thought their pizza was amazing!  I actually ventured to say it's my new favorite pizza in Charlotte.  We had the supreme style pizza and all the veggies were so fresh and full of flavor.  Yum!  Plus they topped if off with slices of tomato which I'm not usually a big fan of but this time around I thought it was delicious.  Their menu isn't terribly extensive but it doesn't matter to me because I will always be ordering this pizza from now on.",

I recommend the Breakfast and Spinach Ricotta Pizzas as well as the Wood-fired Vegetable Sandwich--all are delish.  If they have any Balkan specials, those are worth trying too b/c the dudes who own this place are totally representing their motherland.    As an added plus, they always have great drink specials (e.g., half-off martinis on Saturdays) and appetizers are 50% between 5-7pm (I recommend the corn dip and portabello mushroom tower).  Their outdoor seating area is a big hit in the warmer months, too, and is a good place for groups.",

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday evening around 11:30 and while I went with a friend, my first impression of this place was \"Wow, great little romantic place for a date!\". With exposed brick walls, low lighting and some rustic Italian/Baroque charm (think Milan art gallery, not Olive Garden decor). The bar was full and a few booths had people, but we didn't have to wait and got a little booth by a window looking out at the street.  Saturdays they have 1/2 priced martinis so I indulged and got a Honeydew martini as well as a Berry martini and both were amazing. The Berry had over 6 liqueurs in it, so needless to say I was a happy camper only having to pay $4.50 for it!  My friend ordered the Fungi pizza and it was great - the crust wasn't thin like a cracker but was just thick enough to give a great wood grilled taste and allow the fresh ingredients to really speak for themselves. I had the Intermezzo salad (balsamic dressing came on top and it was a BIT oily for my taste) and the veggie lasagna. The lasagna was a spot on choice. I dare say it's the best I've ever had with wood grilled vegetables, an aromatic array of spices, a nice chunky but light marinara and fresh Parmesan on top. Our meal also came out with homemade bread cut into 4 pieces which was just icing on the cake - the bread was just hands down impressive and really a memorable addition to the meal (how often do you get to say that about bread??!?!).  Our server was Trey and he was a great balance between attentive and relaxed, and was so warm it definitely made a great impression on us - we left saying \"Can't wait to go back!\".  Excited to try some of their Eastern European dishes next time....",

    "text": "Intermezzo is one of those gems that didn't catch my eye from the road but word of mouth about their delicious food caught my ear!  My short reasoning for giving Intermezzo 5 stars - a) food is amazing, b) price can't be beat.  My only desire for this restaurant is to update the decor inside, and dust the wine racks.  Other than that, I had no complaints.  I went with some friends around 6:30 on a Friday.  We were pleasantly surprised to get a table immediately (only 2 left inside).  The menu made my mouth water.  The selection of appetizers, pizzas and entrees sent me into sensory overload!  Since we were all so undecided, we decided to share.  I was able to sample the Mediterranean Salad, the Grilled Eggplant and the Sauteed Spinach Pizza.  The Grilled Eggplant absolutely surpassed my expectations.  It was perfectly dressed in a basil olive oil, ripe sweet tomatoes, and a dash of balsamic - I could have eaten the whole plate.  Similarly, the pizza swept me off my feet.  I'm from NY, so it's hard to find pizza that can do that!  The dough is fresh, and allows me to fold my pizza (sign of a True NY'er).  All of the ingredients blended together wonderfully.  Last on my food list was the salad.  There was a mix of baby greens, feta, black olives, and we substituted the sun-dried tomato dressing for a balsamic dressing.  It was light and a perfect fit to our meal.  The added bonus to the food menu is the martini menu.  Holy freaking cow.  There must have been 20 different choices.  I opted for the Cantaloupe - a refreshing choice it was!  As most martini prices go, they ranged from $9 to $11.  However, there are much cheaper drink options.  My friends opted for the draft beer specials - $3 Stella's!  We will definitely be dining in again or taking advantage of their delivery very soon!",

Despite a wait, Adam was a super nice server and took care of us.  App: Portabello Mushroom Tower - wouldn't call this a tower, more like a small speedbump but it was good, goat cheese was delicious  Entree: Vege Lasagna - great, really like the sauce  Entree: Wood Grilled Vegetable Sandwich - dining companion had this and she raved about it  Also liked the small, cozy bricked interior - good stuff.",

I ordered the shopska salad and I have to say, it was the worst salad I've ever had.  For 8.75 I got the most mealy tomatoes and a saucer sized serving that would barely qualify as an appetizer. A True chef would never serve those tomatoes. I blame myself for ordering something with tomatoes when they are not in season. But the size of the serving is on them. I give it 2stars for the service and atmosphere. Next time I will suggest we try somewhere new. There are too many places in the same area that are competing for our business.",

Their plates are huge and you'll definitely have leftovers to take home.   This trip, we came on a Saturday night. My husband got a large pizza and I got the Breca something (it was breaded pork cutlet). My husbands pizza was full of veggies and meat on every slice and he couldn't have been happier. My meal was extremely dry, and I asked for olive oil to help. Our (wonderful) server said that the Serbs eat this meal with the creamed spinach on top of the pork. I wish it would have been served that way, or I was told how to eat it when it came to the table because I couldn't get past the dryness, but the spinach did help!   This is definitely a spot to check out and expand your pallet on (or stay in the safe zone with their traditional fare)!",

    "text": "Pizza plus old world Serbian fare? That equation may sound odd, but it feels so right. And delicious.   I think I've had almost everything on the menu. It's all pretty good. Their pizza is some of my favorite in Charlotte. I like both the Capriccioso and Intermezzo Supreme. App wise, the bruschetta is great. I love how the housemade Mozzarella is melted over the tomatoes. Portabella mushroom tower is yummy as well, just note that it's a smaller size starter. The shopska is a good salad-like option to share. The eggplant musaka and cabbage rolls are delicious. I think the Piroska is a hidden star on this menu. It's kind of like stuffed pizza or calzone type dish. I always add spinach to mine.   You can order online via their website for pick up or delivery. They do half priced wine on Wednesdays. The patio has a nice view of the skyline. Gah, our city is so pretty.   I've known Branko and Djordje since back in their days of working at Cosmos a decade ago. They are hard workers, take a lot of pride in what they do, and are just great people in general. So proud of them and all they are doing at Intermezzo.",

The bartender greeted us and a waitress unenthusiastically mumbled that we could sit anywhere.  We told our server that we had never been before and since there seemed to be a lot of delicious options on the menu, we asked her for a couple of recommendations. The waitress was extremely short with us and acted like we were a burden even though we seemed to be her only table.  We ordered an appetizer and our server asked us if we wanted marinara sauce. We said yes and when we got our bill, we discovered that we had been charged $2 for about two tablespoons of marinara. I know $2 is not a lot of money, but my friend and I likely would have turned down the marinara if we had been informed that it would cost extra.  I ordered the \"House Made Ravioli\" for $16.95. My plate came out with five lukewarm ravioli and way too much tomato cream sauce.  I doubt I'll return to this place.",

Last visit we lucked out and found out they have half priced martinis on Saturday...they were not skimping on the booze in them either. You really can't beat a $5-6 martini on the weekend. They also had half priced apps until 7, this may only be at the bar though.   Definitely a fan of Intermezzo and I need to make a point to go more often!",

For my meal I ordered the Piroska. Geesh, it was amazing! I absolutely agree with Nikki - this is definitely a hidden star on the menu! I mean it's similar to a calzone and packed with flavor. Based on a recommendation from our server I added spinach and it was a perfect combination of awesome. I also got to sample a bit of the eggplant moussaka and it's just as yummy!

It was awesome!   For dinner, we started by sharing some of their homemade bread. It was warm, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. For entrees, we both resisted our urge to go with something tradition and instead opted for some of their Serbian dishes. I had the piroska and added spinach and onions. I was hesitant about the sour cream but it was delicious. My boyfriend had the karadjordjeva and he loved it! He described it as similar to chicken cordon bleu. I had hoped to have room for a Nutella crepe but was far too full.   Great food. Great drinks. Great service.  We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "After months I finally made it to Intermezzo. I decided to try a variety of items, to get a good idea of their food. I started with a house salad. House salad is lettuce, carrots, cucumber and onion with a balsamic dressing. The salad was good, but nothing great.  After the salad I had the bruschetta and chicken and vegetable soup. The bruschetta was amazing, toasted homemade bread with tomatoes and cheese. I did ask for a side of marinara for dipping and that made it amazing! As for the soup, chicken and veggies, carrots, zucchini, onion and corn, served in a light broth. Very nice and served perfectly warm. Service was on point and I found the environment very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will be back!",

They have a great happy hour with half price apps and they have a solid selection of local beers. They have the best eggplant we have ever had in a restaurant it is a nice thick cut that has not been breaded and deep fried like most places! Amazing you must try it:) everyone we were with loved their meals and we sat out side and enjoyed the view of uptown.",

She proceeded to seat us at a table off to the side, which had hard card table style chairs.  The table itself was on a slope, and I felt like I was at the top of the hill and my husband was at the bottom.  We asked to be moved and were accommodated by the hostess, who appeared to be harried. Our new table sported chairs that were more comfortable. We ordered the Quattro fromagio pizza.  It appeared to be dry and over cooked, with some of the crust darkened, however, it was edible.  But, hey, it was date night!  We still had a good time!",

We usually just get pizza - the crust is just perfect, nicely thin but with a lovely \"crusty\" crust. We love the \"pepe ed olive\" pizza that comes with ground beef. In fact, the ground beef (which first sounded a little odd to me) is so good, we often opt to substitute it for other meats. Ask for Parmesan; it's not just a green tub of dusty cheese, but a bowl of nicely grated actual cheese (how crazy)!   They have a relatively small but respectable selection of beers and wines. Great when you want an easy dinner, not too many choices! It's a nice, cozy setting with brick walls, just the right lighting, and really friendly servers. We often get caught up in conversations with our servers, and although they don't mind stopping to chat, you're never left waiting on them.",

    "text": "Cozy place with old brick charm that manages to successfully bridge the 602km, two countries (Slovenia and Croatia), and the Adriatic Sea  to offer both traditional Serbian and Italian fare. Somehow, this formula works!  Came here on a late fall Friday night around 6:00pm and was able to get seated immediately, though things soon changed. By 7:00 there were people waiting in line to sit outside, though the enclosed (and actually acceptably warm) patio had plenty of space. The takeaway: arrive early, this place fills up!  Inside, the tables are spacious, not too crowded, and a good place to relax! Service was stellar and happy to help us take advantage of the $3 draft Stella or Fat Tire beer specials. Well played!  We ordered the much acclaimed Ground Beef Burek and the Wood Grilled Vegetable Sandwich. As fate would have it, right after ordering the table next to us began wafting a buttery-garlic aroma that resulted in 8.0 rumble in my tummy. We had to call back the waitress for an order of the garlic bread sticks. Yum.  Food was all-around delicious. The Burek is simply amazing: fillo dough encasing beef and onions. While the description made me think of flaky fillo dough like on Greek spanikopida, it is actually more on the doughy side (in a very positive way!). Definitely worth it and I would )and plan to) come back for the express purpose of getting this again.  I had a few bites of the Vegetable Sandwich and it was a very well put together mix of veggies and cheese. The garlic bread sticks were good, but I was expecting more based on the smell--probably worth getting once.  I shall return to sample more Serbian food!",

    "text": "IMHO the cuisine rates 3 stars at best.   I'd award it another star for the excellent service, reasonable prices, the cozily grungy dining room and good vibes ...  but I just can't do it because it's already received too many 5 stars for a restaurant that still has plenty of room for improvement  Those red curtains outside give the wrong impression, walking into the restaurant for the first time was a pleasant surprise. The waiter/bartender was super. He was friendly, always on top of things and struck the right balance between casual and respectful. Also for once I was not driving so I finally got to enjoy a Martini fueled dinner (plain with olives for me).   The Portobello tower was misnamed - it was about 2\" tall. No biggie in itself, that was source of amusement really. The mushroom was a bit tough, the red peppers were great but the goat cheese was that generic (cheap) kind that every restaurant uses and almost tasteless as always. If real goat cheese is not in the budget I'd rather have some feta or even blue cheese but something with a little bite to it. At $9 I can only rate it OK, not bad.  2 1/2*  I confess that I came especially for the Spinach and Cheese Burek. I'm familiar with the Greek, Turkish and my mother's Romanian version but not the Serbian. I should have read David A's review, he did warn about the Phyllo leaves. :-[ Yes I expected crispy and flaky layers of Phyllo with sharp cheese and fresh spinach. It's been my favorite dish since childhood. Instead I was served a large artistically shaped portion of ....dough. It looked a bit like hallah but tasted like a calzone variant. The cheese was not Casieri, Cascaval or anything of the sort, probably ricotta and it was totally bland. There was not enough spinach in it to notice. I didn't expect a calzone.   Very possibly this is exactly what the Serbian version should be like I have no way of knowing it. Simply rating it on how tasty it was, I'd say 2 1/2 stars, but the salad that came with it was very good so together I'd rate the plate 3 stars.   The Moussaka was not the traditional kind either but it was excellent, it was served with a very good tomato sauce -while the Lasagna gets the bechamel, go figure. Wish it had been served with a little something on the side but the menu doesn't offer any. Still I'd rate their  Moussaka 4 stars.    Dessert was crepes stuffed with a big mound of fruits. It kind of looked like crepes but it tasted like, and had the consistency of, American pancake - only thinner.  The pricing is generally moderate but inconsistent. Main dishes are only $11-13 but appetizers like humus ($9.25) corn dip w/tortillas ($9) or the Portobello I mentioned are way overpriced for this venue. Plus they don't offer any side dishes, IMO the menu needs a little tweaking and I'm offering this as constructive criticism.  All together it made for an enjoyable dinner and I'm looking forward to going back and trying other dishes. I'm thinking of the pork schnitzel and the stuffed cabbage  next time.",

We don't have a freezer or a deep fryer, we make everything, including our mozzarella in house\".   How could I NOT love this place!  It's got a cozy interior, most everything is made in-house, and our server was super helpful in recommending dishes and telling us about how each is made. Just don't whiz by and miss this place, because it's easy to do, despite it's prominent position smack dab in the intersection of some busy streets.   To the food!  Appetizer, Ricotta/Goat Cheese Crostini: Super fresh tasting ricotta and goat cheeses, melted and toasted on a pizza crust like bread, light and airy and super crisp. Delish!  Margarita Pizza: Just how I like it.  Fresh home made mozz, big slices of tomato, plenty of basil and the crust in a crunchy, chewy, olive oil brushed crust.  Super fresh.   The creme de la creme...the jewel of our meal...the warm-your-insides-on-a-brisk-fall-day...the stuffed cabbage. We were told the cabbage is pickled in a barrel for a month, then stuffed with bacon, ground beef and other ingredients, and cooked for 4 hours until it's delightfully tender and flavorful.  The two stuffed cabbages come in a super savory, salty broth you sop up with either the homemade bread, or...what we did, our pizza crusts.   The strawberry, banana and hazelnut chocolate crepe was recommended to us, and perfectly eggy, lacy and brown on the edges...with a nice cup of tea it was the perfect ending to our meal.   Intermezzo is definitely my latest restaurant obsession!  TIP: Mama loves Tennis and Djokovic so the Tennis Channel was on both the TVs we saw. Our good service, delicious food and stories behind the restaurant made me want to write Djokovic's agent, and ask if he could send Mama an autographed photo.",

Attentive. Knowledgeable about food and their menu.   FOOD:   Everything tastes good! Great selection.  Eclectic menu. Full of flavor.  There Pizzas are thin crust with FRESH toppings and True italian seasonings.  My favorite is the Grilled Vegetable Sandwich - it's so tasty!  Made with home-made bread, some goat cheese then filed with fresh vegetables grilled in the wood burning grill.  The Serbian food is yummy, too.  Authentic European style!  Satisfies my craving for wienerschnitzle and other delectable treats.  The brushetta is my favorite appetizer - perfectly crusted bread with fresh tomatoes and tons of fresh basil then melted fresh mozzarella on top.  I could keep writing but it's making me so hungry :-)  DRINK:   Good pour for a good price!  Always fun to hang at the bar, good service and good selection of liquors.  They have an awesome happy hour drink special on Thursdays ... only $3 for Stoli flavors.

Pictured: -Ricotta and Goat cheese crostini (not a goat cheese fan myself) but the flavor of the ricotta mixed was excellent.  -Mexican Pizza (seasoned beef, mozzarella, black beans, tomatoes, scallions, cilantro, jalapenos, and spicy cream) HOLY COW! This was one of the best pizzas I've had in Charlotte, the waiter told us it was good but I was blow away. Great taste and flavors.  . . If your Looking for a wonderful place to check out, this is it. Perfect for family dinner or a night out with friends.",

The service was great, we were seated quickly, my server was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations, and out food came out quickly. They also have a covered patio are if you want to eat outside and not get beaten down by the hot sun.   Now the menu is a cross between Serbian and Italian. It threw me off for a little bit but as long as you give it a chance you won't be disappointed. I ordered the chicken francese normally the dish comes with mashed potatoes but I subbed it for noodles and it came out very very good. Great lemon flavor and not too over powering.   I would totally recommend this place to anyone. I also hear they have great Pizza. I'll have to try for the next time I come.",

Started off with the Ricotta And Goat Cheese Crostini with a side of marinara as recommended by the waiter. Very tasty and the ricotta evened out the goat cheese flavor a lot. Then my boyfriend and I split the 16 inch Mexican Pizza which was very tasty! The crema on it was great. Perfect portion for two people. Cool space with a nice outside patio right at the 5 way intersection in plaza. Only wish here would be for there to be a few more apps to choose from. Great experience and will definitely be back!",

The hubby and I got here around 6:15 PM on a Saturday night and there was NO wait - yes please. We sat outside because at the time it was still warm out in Charlotte, and slightly regret that decision due to the influx of flies that bombarded us as soon as our pizza was served... but I guess that's part of the risk, right? Our server was friendly and attentive which balanced out the annoying bug issue.  We started off with the Garlic Braided Twists with marinara sauce for dipping and were thrilled when our server told us we made it in time for half-off apps. We ordered the Intermezzo Supreme (no olives) and were quite happy with our choice.   Next time we're here, I'd like to try one of the non-pizza options -- everything looks and sounds delicious. Looking forward to it!",

We ordered the Bruschetta app that was very tasty and had fresh tomatoes and delicious mozzarella cheese (we ate it before I could snap a picture). We have tried the eggplant musaka - it is surprising in how great the flavors are in this dish!!, lasagna - a Italian favorite that does not disappoint as it taste like everything came straight out of a garden so full of flavor and freshness, chicken and veggie pasta - a generous amount of pasta and veggies smothered in a light flavorful sauce.  We are back for more! This time we got the corn dip as an app - heat from the jalapenos perfectly complements the corn and cheese. We ordered the lasagna and eggplant musaka for this evening. Just as delicious as the first time we came here!!    This place continues to amaze me! Always delicious and flavorful. I will keep coming back for sure!!",

I prefer my pizza, to be real Italian style with a twist of risen and light crust- just a personal preference!  On another note, here are some facts about Intermezzo: - It has been serving Charlotte for 10 years.  - Handmade dough and mozzarella.  - Hand-tossed pizza - Traditional Serbian dishes - They deliver to Uptown, Elizabeth, and the Plaza-Midwood areas!

It took 30 minutes to receive the drinks we ordered. Almost 50 minutes for apps and over an hour to get our entrees. I understand that may have been busy and possibly a little understaffed. We watched other tables around us be sat and leave well before we did.  I worked in the food and beverage industry for years. If there is one little thing wrong at my table or there's long ticket times, I get management to go over and check in.  And I get them a free dessert.  I want my guests to know I care about them.  Especially if it's a special occasion like it was last night.  It's not that hard to make people feel valued.  Needless to say we did not feel valued after choosing this restaurant for our dinner. If someone makes a reservation for a special occasion, I'd suggest making sure they are taking care of.",

We tried the corn dip appetizer which seems weird for an Italian place but it was top notch. We also got the Capricioso & Chicken Florentine half and half pizza. When I asked for ranch my server said absolutely not, we don't carry that...but I do have a homemade feta dressing. It was WAY better then ranch, just like my server said.

Grilled veggie had ample toppings that were chopped small enough to get a good splattering of everything everywhere without them being too small to taste and the goat cheese wasn't so overbearing that it took over the pizza.The Milanese had a nice mix of cheeses that gave the whole thing a great flavor blend. The hummus wasn't as awesome as the pizza, but we really just came for the pizza anyway and it was just a randomly chosen prelude. I'm definitely a fan overall.",

The staff is always very friendly and willing to give you suggestions about different dishes!!  My favorite thing on the menu is the Wood Grilled Fungi pizza. The flavor, the crust, the EVERYTHING is just phenomenal. Appetizers, you can't go wrong with; from the bruschetta, to the garlic braided twists and the goat cheese crostini!   Intermezzo also carries one of my favorite beers, on draft: Blanche de Bruxells!!!   The atmosphere is awesome, inside and out!  All in all, there is not a single thing about Intermezzo that I dislike!!",

Food was bland, beer glasses always warm. Small space and average food and warm-ish beer -- no thanks! Nothing to write home about food wise, so save the time and hit up Pint Central or Pizza Peel.",

I had a turkey burger, asked for no onions and it was covered in both purple onions and white ones were cooked in the meat, which also made it taste like meatloaf instead of a turkey burger. Not a fan of the bread it comes with personally, but if you like their pizza crust, the bread on this sandwich is the same. We also ordered fettuccini and blackened chicken, which was very bland. It just didn't have much of a taste at all. The last thing we ordered was the pepperoni sausage pizza (can't remember name). It was exactly what you ordered, so if thats the pizza you want, you'll be good to go with that one.",

This was my third time going to Intermezzo. The first was to score some sweet happy hour deals (which are in fact, sweet including half priced appetizers) and the second was a pizza delivery when mom was in town (let's talk about how it was super quick because I'm just up the street and the pizza was piping hot and delish).   Tonight we were fortunate enough to drop in on half price martini night. I will not complain about a martini that is only $4.50. I had the peach nectar which was good, really sweet, but only had a subtle hint of booze.  For dinner, I had the Intermezzo Supreme pizza. It's a solid pizza with all kinds of toppings, a hearty crust and delicious cheese. It was so good it was hard to put down (luckily I had enough self control to bring some leftovers home). My friend had the crepe (I appreciate her dessert for dinner approach) and I stole a few bites, and that was also excellent.   Prices are definitely reasonable. 10 inch pizza and a drink for under 20 bucks. I'll definitely be going back. A lot.",

If you are coming down Central, the restaurant is on the corner of 10th & Central but you can not make a left turn - go figure!  After several u-turns, we finally made it into the parking lot and enter a whole new dining experience.  Can not say enough about the aroma when you enter.  You start salivating before you are seated.  Service was spot-on with our waiter suggesting several items and explained how they were prepared.  The three of us ordered all different dishes then played round robin.  The broyke (?) was phenominal - pastry stuffed with ground beef, onion and seasonings - how can you go wrong!  Stuffed cabbage was great especially with the recommendation from our waiter to put some hot sauce on it.  Crowning piece was the chocolate creme brulee - this was actually a vanilla creme brulee with chocolate pieces and strawberries - was so good and I do love my creme brulee.  This would stand up to any I have tasted.    Don't be put off by the appearance from the outside.  Once you enter, it is foodie heaven!",

Interesting combination of foods on the menu but it all seems to work together.

It looks like a honey bun and tastes amazing (also very filling).  As good as the beef burek was, the Karadjordjeva was even better.  It is extremely tender and the Kajmak cheese and dill tartar sauce make it amazing.  If you want takeout and/or pizza, I highly recommend ordering your pizza from here.

The fella and I had Groupon, and we ventured in on a Wednesday night. Although outdoor seating is a possibility, it was too cold the night we went.   I don't know what I expected it to look like on the inside, but it sooo surpassed that - exposed brick walls, nooks and crannies with quaint tables, knick knacks lining a high railing around the bar, cozy, red, hanging lights illuminating the bar... love! We were greeted by the nicest, friendliest man when we walked in, and our waitress (Kate?) was so helpful and fun. I loved everything about it. Seating is fairly limited inside - there were maybe 6 or 7 booths, a few tables, and then 6-8 chairs at the bar.  I decided to get the Becka Snicla (which is pretty much like wienerschnitzel) for $13.25, and the fella settled on the Karadjordjeva for $13.95. He definitely won. Mine wasn't bad; it was just a little bland and dry. He gave me a few bites of his - I had been a little worried about the tartar sauce before we ordered, but it was just drizzled on top, which made there enough for a kick, but not enough to gross me out like tartar sauce usually does. Overall, it was better than mine, but still a little underwhelming.  Maybe we just got the wrong thing and should've stuck to the pizza or the burek? Either way, I'd go back just for the atmosphere and service and chalk up this trip to ordering the wrong things.",

The service is good but the hostess can stand to learn some customer service skills. But all that aside, we really enjoy Intermezzo. They have pizza and Serbian food. Yup. That's right... One strange combination but it works!  We've tried the pizza (excellent!) and the Serbian dishes (BEEF BUREK FTW!). I also love places that bring you freshly grated parm. It's entered the rotation as a usual spot!",

    "text": "Don't be fooled by the sign reading \"Pizzeria and Cafe\" on the outside of Intermezzo's flavor-filled walls. There's gold in them there walls. Lovely, Serbian and Italian culinary gold. That's right. I said Serbian. You're in for a roller coaster ride of freshness and delight.   The location rests off of 10th street and accessed from Central. Pull into the gravel parking lot and sit in the small dining area or on their glorious patio. Stays cool even in the summertime!   Intermezzo is a small staffed joint that makes everything in house. They don't even have a freezer! They make their own phyllo, mozzarella and salad dressings. It doesn't stop there. Ask your server and they'll be able to tell you ad nauseum on how many fresh items are being churned out of that tiny kitchen. It's ridiculous.   So, feeling a bit nervous about trying Serbian cuisine? Never fear! Order the Burek and thank me later. Phyllo filled with cheese and spinach or ground beef. It comes with a house salad, the balsamic reduction and small side of tzatziki-ish cucumber salad. Each bite of the Burek is tender and savory. Mix up the flavors! I take each bite with a bit of salad and the cucumber mixture. Everything swirls with happiness.   Best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had. The marinara and ricotta work together like old pals. My goodness these guys make lasagna like I've never had. Out of this world fresh flavors and packed full of zucchini, squash, onions, tomatoes and other veg.   Bruschetta. All I can say is GET IT. House made mozzarella and fresh bread, tomatoes, basil. Need I say more?   This place packs a punch with their small bar, too. Tons of local beers and plenty of mixed drinks for you to pair with your meal. Great wine list as well. What Italian joint comes sans wine? Not this place.   If you haven't made it into Intermezzo yet, you're in for a treat. One of the Charlotte gems that you'll frequent on the regular. Cheers!",

    "text": "This is my homage to my new favorite pizza place in Charlotte.  My husband and I found a Groupon for Intermezzo ($16 for $30 worth of food). We ordered the house Sauvignon blanc while pondering the simple but diverse menu) appetizers, pizza, sandwiches and salads, and Serbian dishes). We settled on garlic knots, the quatro formaggio pizza and the beef burek (one of the Serbian dishes - filo dough, beef, and cheese).   Everything was incredibly delicious - even though they were some of the more generic/plain dishes.  The house wine was semi-sweet and subtle. The garlic knots had fresh garlic and butter on top and came with the best marinara I've ever had while dining out. The pizza was perfectly salty and cheesy, and the Serbian dish came with the best green salad with balsamic dressing and a cucumber & sour cream salad. Normally, I don't over eat, but everything tasted so good that I was quite full when I made myself stop. Portions were quite large, so half the pizza and about half of the burek were brought home.   Ambiance: The building is old and unique with a kind of New England style (brick with wooden rafters and shuttered windows). It was a great setting for a quiet romantic date night - the music selection was pretty awesome as well.   The only complaint I have is that there are televisions at all (but whatever, some people like that kind of thing).   Overall: I was really impressed with the service and quality of food. My husband and I are excited to try other pizzas and Serbian dishes here.",

When the lady got here she sat in her car for like 3 minutes so i went out & she continued to rustle around her car for another couple of minutes. When she finally came out she said, \"Oh, you must be hungry!\".....weird. Girlfriend got Cajun chicken pasta with extra broccoli & they gave 2 very small pieces & 1 medium piece & half the pasta portion they used to give. My fungi pizza needed salt & was cold & to top it all off, the desert crepes were burnt. Ha. I called them to try & talk to someone in charge but all I could get was the bartender, who kept oddly calling me buddy lol. He told me that the owner had just delivered my food & she would be back shortly. Wtf? Why was the owner delivering food? Anyway, 30 minutes later I actually get a call back & it's some guy. I start to tell him what happened & he starts immediately getting defensive & arguing with everything I say. Then he tells me I don't seem to be happy with anything. Insinuating that I just like to complain. I tell him about the broccoli & he tells me I'm lying & that i never ordered it online....wow. Not to mention, it seemed like around $15 worth of food for $47!!! Bad food at that. Never going back, sorry guys. Maybe you should read these & learn something.",

The inside was a bit small and cramped but the more I hung out there, the more I found it to be cozy instead.  We sat at the bar since the place was busy and we wanted a good beer.  I ordered the Eggplant Mousaka and the bf ordered Sarma (cabbage rolls).  I never finish my meal before my bf but I inhaled every bite of my mousaka!  Not only was the food absolutely amazing and as authentic as it gets, the owner (I assume) was behind the bar and we talked for a good 20 minutes about authentic Serbian cuisine and how all the dishes were made.  He was so enthusiastic and excited to talk about his food and share it with us!  We learned so much!  To top it off, some of the beers on tap were local.  Enough said.  I will definitely be going back!",

Our waiter Georgie (sp) one of the owners was extremely nice and full of personality and very helpful throughout.    We started with the corn dip, it's was sweet and flavorful with a hint of spice, the tortilla chips were average and a little too salty but overall still a great appetizer.   My girlfriend and I shared a 10\" pizza and the beef burek and they were both great.  The pizza was a Capriccioso which is basically meat lovers and was excellent, could stand alone as just a pizza place for me.  The beef burek was also very good.  I didn't know what to expect it was my first experience with Serbian food but it was a nice surprise.  It was meticulously stuffed fillo dough made from scratch and had good flavor, we were encouraged to try a bite of it with the cucumber mixture and the salad and it was quite good but I enjoyed it by itself also.  Finished with crepes for dessert and again owner went out of his way I have a hazel nut allergy so he made one regular crepe for my girlfriend and one crepe for me using a different chocolate sauce.   We will surely be back and happy to pay regular price but will also be on the lookout for future groupons as this place was a hit!  Speaking of groupon they made it super easy to redeem and did so with a smile on their face!",

We had to wait about 15 minutes on a Friday night which isn't too bad.  We sat down, received pretty good service and ordered a couple 10 inch pizzas.    They were good!  I don't remember the names but one had bacon on it and mine had chicken, tomatoes and goat cheese I think.  The toppings were minimal therefore unmemorable.  The crust was good but the pizza slices were a little greasy and so the tip of the pizza was flapped over...just a personal pet peeve.    The prices were a little high for what you get but probably market.  I don't know..everything was just OK.  I could easily go to Harris Teeter and pick up Amy's margarita pizza in the frozen section and be just as satisfied.  There were other things on the menu that looked decent but I just wasn't overly impressed.  It gets a solid 3 stars for my whole experience.",

All gone! For the mains, since my mom is a veggie, she had the vegetarian lasagna and really enjoyed it. I went with the stuffed cabbage and wow, it was excellent. Thick cabbage leaves with a spicy (not hot spicy, this is tasty spicy) ground beef and rice mix in a broth that was served with a loaf of homemade bread. I used up all the bread to soak up the fab broth.  For dessert, we went with the fruit stuffed crepes. Fresh (not frozen) strawberries and banana slices with a hazlenut chocolate drizzle.  There was some fighting involved for the last bit.  Interesting beer choices, I had a Belgian wheat beer that was excellent.  Strong recommendation! Great food, nice ambiance!",

    "text": "We (four of us -- two adults, two teens) visited Intermezzo this past Monday night.  We had been there once before for dinner and found it just ok.  We hadn't tried the pizza, though, so we decided to give it another try.    Upon entering, we could see that there was no one manning the host desk and little to no \"waiting room\" inside the door.  We could also see that all of the tables were already occupied.  We were greeted by someone who basically informed us that they were \"all full,\" as if to rudely imply that they didn't need any more customers.  \"Unless you want to sit outside\" (it was 40 degrees out) or \"eat at the bar,\" we were then told, spotting four available seats together.  We agreed to eat at the bar and began taking our seats.  We were then asked by the bartender if the teens were underage.  Yes.  Duh.  He then informed us that they couldn't sit at the bar because they were underage.  We then tried to explain that we were just there for dinner and weren't going to drink.  We further explained that we only came to the bar because we were TOLD and OFFERED to sit at the bar by the person by the door.  The bartender just kept insisting that we couldn't sit at the bar.  No one -- bartender, manager on duty, etc. -- offered an apology for the error and miscommunication or even gave us alternatives!  Instead, they all just made us feel unwelcome.  How crazy is that?    So, instead we just left all furious and went to enjoy a fantastic meal and service at Midwood Smokehouse just up the street.  We'll never even attempt to return to Intermezzo with its crazy rude service and inability to function as a welcoming establishment.",

    "text": "Couldn't wait to try this place while in town, after seeing the DDD episode with that Piroska.  I wasn't sure about the sour cream part of it, but it works so well.  I went here three times in one week.  I got the sauteed veggies pasta, stuffed cabbage, and Piroska.  The stuffed cabbage and that bread were so good, and hit the spot with the juicy meat stuffed inside that crisp cabbage.  The tomato sauce juice in the bowl you can just drink, it was that good.  But dip the bread in there, that bread is amazing!  The Piroska everyone was getting, and when I got mine I must have eaten it within five minutes.  It was awesome!  Go here and order anything off the menu, even the pizza looked great!",

The waitress was so awful I was afraid to ask for a water refill and when I did she gave us warm water with no ice. Half the time you were mid sentence and she would walk away. Also, we waited over 2.5 hours for food that was either under cooked or over cooked. Will never go here again.",

    "text": "I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place. I've been eating here for a year or so and I used to love them. Used to.   The food was really phenomenal. Everything I ordered was delicious, from the appetizers to the burgers to the traditional Serbian dishes. I'd get a hankering and try something new every so often and it never disappointed.... until recently.  Several months ago, the incorrect dish was delivered to me, and I'd barely even opened the food before the guy showed up again with the correct dish and apologized. Wow. I told him it wasn't necessary in this case, or I would have called, but he insisted that they had to get me the right order because of who I was (loyal customer). I was really touched by how concerned they were with getting the exact order right. Great food, great customer service - what more could you ask for?   A few months after that, things just tanked. Things were left out of our order - I called to let them know and said it wasn't a big deal, but FYI. The second time, I asked for their tomato sauce. That stuff was seriously delicious the first time I had it - so I wanted some more without having to order an entire dish of it. I called and totally offered to pay extra. They charged me $3.50 and I got the equivalent of, like, 2 ketchup packets of sauce. Really? That is super chintzy. This last order (offense number three), we got the stuffed peppers and the weinerschnitzel. It was the smallest piece of meat they'd ever made for us in over a year. On top of that, we were given one small pepper, instead of the two that normally come in an order. We paid $15 for one single medium-sized stuffed pepper? To make matters worse, the taste of this insanely expensive tomato sauce was just not the same. Did they change chefs?   I called and was nice about it, but just was wondering what the heck was going on. I was told I'd get a call back and I never did. I don't know what's happening with Intermezzo, but they've gone from possibly my favorite place to eat in Charlotte to one of the worst amount-of-food-for-your-money ratio and with zero customer service.",

And the roasted veggie pizza offered only a handful of chopped onions and other diced greens rather than the smokey slices we'd enjoyed previously. Anyone can have an off night so we'll try again.",
