We had a few cocktails, both of us loved the melon/Japanese whiskey drink, very refreshing. We shared a few plates, and they were all really good. The shishito peppers were delicious, the ricotta tortellini with the green curry sauce was also tasty, but we thought the pasta was a little thick on it. We had the lamb belly also, which was odd at first but actually we warmed up to it by the time we got done. We had the carrot cake dessert which I would also highly highly recommend! All in all a great spot for a date night or even a casual dinner, really excited for this neighborhood!",

After impressing us so much with her work flow, we decided to work our way through the cocktail list. My wife who doesn't prefer cocktails is still talking about going back for the mezcal cocktail and the local gin cocktail(I forget the names). I preferred the Balancing Act that has an impressive presentation.  Bardo is bound to be a top restaurant in the region if they keep up this high level of quality. Can't wait for our next visit.",

Service was very attentive and the place has a fun and hip ambiance. We tried three cocktails (Putting Down Roots, Cooling Effect, and Professor Plum) and loved them all. We shared six different small plates (beef tartare, charred shishito peppers, roasted sunchokes, aged Ribeye, scallops, and tempura maitake), a dessert (chocolate), and enjoyed every single one! Parking is limited, so plan to Uber or Lyft (worth it just so you can enjoy one or two extra cocktails), or allocate a few extra minutes to find parking. This restaurant is very popular, so definitely make a reservation. When we sat down at 7pm on a Friday evening, the restaurant was full but quiet. By 9pm, the place was hopping! Charlotte has several great restaurants. This place is definitely one of them!",

We loved the menu so much that even when our waiter suggested we split four items, we ordered six -- and I'm so glad we did.  We decided on the tartare, crudo kampachi, octopus, lamb belly, egg & grains, and shishito peppers.  Each dish was memorable in its own way and it is impossible for me to pick a favorite.  i would definitely order each one again.  The service was well paced.  We never had too many plates on the table, nor did we have to wait too long for the next course.  Drinks were also delicious.  I loved the salt/spice rim on the cooling effect and my husband enjoyed the south mint.  Overall, a fantastic dining experience.  I wish we lived closer!",

Cocktails, wine, food, and service were all top of the chart.   I won't get into details of each dish (we shared 8, I think, and had to order more of the beef tartare and crudo), but each was exquisite.   Whatever the opposite of heavy handed, this food represents.  Crafted.  Delicate.  Precise.  Fresh.  Flavor bombs, each bite of everything.   And any complaints about portion sizes are silly...look at the prices.  This is a menu set up as your own personal tasting experience...order 5-6 dishes with your partner and you'll have had plenty to eat and have spent no more than at any other fine dining joint in town.  Bravo, best food we've had in Charlotte in awhile...been eating in this town 20 years.",

The atmosphere is somewhat loud, cramped, and cold; but stylish.  The floors are concrete, walls are cinder block, and ceiling exposed account for this.  The wait staff are casually professional.  The wine list lacks recognizable favorites and come up short on value. I had a bottle of the Cab Franc and a glass of the Columbia Valley Cab; both disappoint.

Here's what I mean - it's a pretty small space (beautiful, but small), so in my opinion, not ideal for large groups and not ideal for fam dinners with kids! But perfect for small intimate groups, or date nights. The menu is limited, but not really i.e. there are a variety of meats / seafood but one dish of each kind - a veal dish, a scallops dish, an octopus one, oysters, one made of beets, one of shishito peppers... you see what I'm saying. If you're looking for something more conventional, your options will be limited. If the above sound good to you - you're in for a treat. The portions are on the smaller side, the good part about that - you can try everything on the menu. the bad part - it's gonna be an expensive meal. The decor is minimal (on the outside too) and beautiful. I am a fan of the semi open kitchen, and they have some delicious cocktails too. It's definitely a place worth experiencing a couple times, if you haven't yet!",

We then had the aged ribeye w kimchi butter perfect. We did wine by the glass a list of nice offerings. The chef came and visited our table as they should so it was nice to put a face to the artist preparing our food and yes each plate looked like a little price of art!Nice bonus.

    "text": "excellent food.  went there on their first opening.  had a great dining experience.  we ordered couple courses to share.    the oyster.  fresh and delightful.  the yuzu sauce doesnt overtake the freshness of the oysters and the oysters were fresh and yummy.  shishito pepper w/ xo sauce.  its spicy and crunchy, not extremely spicy which I like.  Spanish octopus.  crunchy outside while its soft and tender.  the diced sausage and the sauce compliment the octopus big time.  a very thoughtful dish.  the steak with some kind of rice.  mix them!  the rice is a bit salty by itself.  but the dynamic changes upside down when u eat with the steak.  steak is cooked perfectly.  lamb belly.  I have a thing for belly.  this rates top of my list.  the belly has layers of flavors bursting out on and after your first bite.  it's a must order item.  the service is attentive but not overwhelming.  the chef owner even came out to explain his creations.  I usually don't rate 5 stars for restaurant unless it shows their passion, great service and good food.  this one has all of above.  must return and highly recommended.",

We showed up just before 8pm on Friday night and without reservations (not advised), but we were able to squeeze in at the bar for a few of their signature cocktails. My favorite was the cruel summer. For dinner we ordered the charred shishito peppers, tempura maitake, aged ribeye and the Spanish octopus. The octopus was a last minute decision because the bartender said it was his favorite, and oh Lordy I'm glad he did. Every bite was to die for. The peppers were not too spicy but oh so flavorful. The mushroom may have been our favorite, whatever cream sauce they have paired it with was divine. The aged ribeye and kimchi rice were perfectly tasty and filled us up fast. The ribeye sat on a nice soy glaze and went very well with the mushroom, I was glad that they brought those two dishes out together despite being initially confused with the timing. The octopus came last, and I swear I came too. It was better than dessert! So tender, with a dense, rich dollop of creamy potatoes and a bit of bacon.Dear God, I think I said aloud at least three times, \"I've never been so happy in my whole life.\" I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",

We actually had reservations elsewhere, but when we saw that the cocktails here sounded a lot better, we decided to change our plans.   This is now one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants, and I have eaten at 120 places here in the last year and a half.   We started with shishito peppers, which had a very yummy sauce on them. Next up was crudo, which was one of the best crudos I've had. We followed that up with beef tartare (very good) and brandade (a new dish for us -- it's basically a warm cod and potato spread that you eat over bread). But the BEST dish was the 60-day aged beef. Mind blowing. It was so flavorful and tender...I could've had about 10 plates! For dessert, my wife had the carrot cake (paired nicely with ginger ice cream), while I had charred peaches.   Drinks are very unique, and the bartender was really nice and even came over to help me choose my second cocktail.   Service was outstanding. Our waitress provided excellent service and was attentive to our needs. No one was snooty or pretentious, although it's clear everyone takes pride in their work.   Decor is super cute. It did get difficult having so many plates on the small tables for two, but that's a minor complaint. Open-concept kitchen and bar is nice to see, too.   I can't wait to come back here!",

We had 5 things for the 2 of us: octopus (ok), shishito peppers (sizable portion, decent flavor), mushroom dish (meh, the raw mushrooms were overly doused in vinegar),  pasta (terrible - no flavor and didn't even finish it), steak (meh... it was described as melt in your mouth but in reality it was the opposite ... tough and overly salted).  -No hostess and our waitress left unannounced midway through the meal and then someone else started serving us -The price. Portions are small for a big price tag. The steak is $23 and literally 2 bites.",

The cocktails were great (I had the South Mint 75) my girlfriend had the Cooling Effect which I tasted and loved as well. Between us we ordered the NC Shrimp, the Oysters, the Crab and the aged Ribeye and the Scallops. It's really hard to say which one was my favorite because they were all unique and super delicious. I would probably lean towards the NC Shrimp because it was just so extraordinarily good and I honestly didn't have high expectations with that dish because to me there's only so much you can do with shrimp but my mind was blown with that dish. I loved the music and it was funny to me to see people dining who, based only on appearances would bet they would not love the music but also bet they didn't care because the food was soooo good! So I'm already looking forward to my next visit so I can try the other items on the food and cocktail menu. This is a True foodie destination. If you want your taste buds to have a party then bring them to Bardo- they will celebrate with every fork, spoon and sip!",

It requires a foodie & albeit the most consummate foodie to understand the menu offerings w/o looking at photos or online to understand the ingredients. One can be adventurous & just go for it!   My selections this evening were the dry aged beef & the Japanese broth.  The rice accoutrement that came w/the dry aged beef was quite tasty & had a little kick too it but not too much for a palate that isn't a fan of any type of heat this did not overwhelm. The sauce on the beef itself was delicious.  The meat was tender & cooked a perfect medium rare.   The broth itself was good.  The accompanying white fish if it had a taste was completely overwhelmed by the broth & the seaweed.   My small group during prime dinner hour & 1 gentlemen were the only patrons.  The establishment down the street was booming from the time we arrived to the time we left.  Bardo's menu may be a bit too ambitious & pricey for its location on a weeknight.   Bardo's creativity is second to none.",

First, you will likely need a reservation. The place is small so it can get loud. They have replaced the seats along the wall since my first visit. Thank goodness as they sunk in so much you felt like you were lounging and couldn't sit comfortably at the table. Others commented that the chairs were too low and they felt like they were sitting too far down. We had a party of 5 and ordered 10 of their 12-13 menu options. Each item comes out when ready and arrives nicely spaced out. Our server did a nice job describing drink and menu items we asked about. We kept calling her Sarah but I think her name was Natalie.  I really enjoyed the ribeye, octopus, shishito peppers, mushrooms, scallops, and finally the lamb neck was my favorite. We also had the sardines, crudo, sunchokes, & the egg and grains. Really everything was great and very skillfully plated. We also had all 3 desserts with the carrot cake being my favorite. Watching the Chef is cool as the kitchen is very open. Also, you can see him lose his sh*t on the staff. All part of the experience of a small restaurant, intense menu and an open kitchen. I'd definitely return and recommend Bardo. To some it will seem pricey, but Charlotte really needs this caliber of a chef in our restaurant scene. One final shout out to the bartenders and the cocktails. Excellent.",

The food was great! It's a tapas/small plates concept, which some love and others hate. We enjoyed all our our meals. As a vegetarian, I appreciated the options even amongst the small menu offerings I was still able to get a full meal.  We ordered a few of the mocktails, since the restaurant is still awaiting its liquor license. They were all well crafted and enjoyable.  The cons:  My partner ordered a beer and it was not cold in the slightest. Not sure if this was due to them just getting their beer permit or not.  The music - the music itself was great, but we were interrupted twice by pandora ads. And not just quick ads, but 1 minute+ advertisements. This would have been fine had we not been the only ones in the place, so it was very distinguishable.   Service was pretty much great, except a few hiccups that I'm sure will be taken care of as they work through some of the growing pains. We twice ran out of water/beverages and the waitstaff was congregating at the bar chatting quite loudly (it's a small place, and again we were the only table - so took a little away from the experience, but nothing too serious!)   Bottom line:   Will return again sometime. Hope this place does well and works out a few of the minor kinks!",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, delicious food and wonderful service. We came here on a date night, after hearing raving reviews from many friends. We sat at the bar (as we normally do), and enjoyed some cocktails - the South Mint and Putting Down Roots. We started with the Sunchoke (a newer, seasonal item) and enjoyed the crunch and flavors that marinated together. We also tried the Ricotta Tortellini, which was served with green curry, coconut, cauliflower and chopped peanuts. The flavors were very precise and the tortellini was delicious. My favorite was the Spanish octopus, which paired nicely with the spicy chorizo. If you've never tried octopus, this is the place to try it! For dessert, we tried the carrot cake with ginger ice cream, and again, were very impressed with the taste and textures. While the portion sizes are smaller here, they are very detailed and delicate, and for many of the dishes we tried, the flavor went a long way. The restaurant is on the smaller side and gets very busy on the weekends, so I would suggest making a reservation. The atmosphere is very cozy and romantic with dim lighting. I also appreciate the open kitchen concept, where diners are able to see the chefs at work. The service is great. Overall, I would definitely return and look forward to more delicious meals here in the future.",

The menu includes beautifully-plated small plates by Chef Michael Noll and phenomenal cocktails by Amanda Britton.  Our favorite cocktail was the Putting Down Roots with Muddy River Rum, Sombra Mezcal, yellow beet, carrot, dill, ginger and lime. So fresh and so tasty.  The beef tartar is amazing, as is the Crudo Kampachi and the Smoked Beets.    The restaurant itself is cozy and intimate, with modern decor. The design includes an open kitchen so you can see the food being prepared.   It is a small restaurant and they don't take reservations, so get there early or plan on getting a drink from the bar while you wait.    Great in concept and in execution.",

Food is beautiful, but truly overworked.    The portions are tiny for the price, and you can tell the restaurant is trying to be really fine dining (and charges for that) but the flavors/seasoning don't live up to that promise.    We had the beets (presentation is outdated at this point elsewhere and goat cheese and beets isn't exactly revolutionary), the tortellini (good but the curry sauce is really pretty bland), steak (good but actually pretty over seasoned especially the rice on the side, which definitely did not have the texture of a risotto as the waiter claimed) and one other item I can't even remember just a few days later.  Service was nice and wine was quality.    I just moved from San Francisco, lived years in Seattle, NY and Amsterdam before that so I am not opposed to paying a lot for a quality experience but the price/portion ratio here is really not right.  We were starving after four dishes between us and not willing to pay a high price for several more dishes. We closed out and went and had ramen.  Again, I hope the Charlotte food scene continues to develop but this place did not meet the hype for us.",

However the service was appalling. The most rude servers and hostess. When my generous friend stepped aside to pay our bill for the table (she wanted to cover the tab and not have a back and forth at the table), she was told how rude and horrible WE were and how there were so many complaints about us. Our group was absolutely astonished as we did not complain about anything, we were not intoxicated as they accused us of being, and did not behave poorly in any way. Yes admittedly we were late for our reservation. But that treatment towards guests of this restaurant for the first time was something I've never seen.   Do yourself a favor and choose any other restaurant in Charlotte and you'll have a much better experience and equally delicious food.",

A girlfriend treated me to a belated birthday dinner here. We both had heard incredible things and were elated to finally give Bardo a try. Wandered in on a Friday night to a nearly empty space. We ordered 5 of the 8 items on the menu and while the dishes were beautifully plated and presented, we were completely underwhelmed by the lack of taste, flavors or uniqueness of all dishes. Luckily the evening was slightly salvaged by an incredibly tentative waiter and delicious drinks. I would recommend coming here for a quiet date night for drinks, but at $150+, I'd say save your money for a trip to NY for a worthy $$$ dining experience.   Drink Recommendation: Cooling Effect (lunazul reposado tequila, arbol & guajillo peppers, aloe, agave, lime)",

    "text": "I've recently been hearing so many good things about Bardo (including that it's the best restaurant in Charlotte), that it was the obvious choice for my birthday this year.   There were 11 of us that went. Some wanted to try more of the menu than others, so we split the table in half. My half tried the entire menu (13 small plates). Right now the menu is: oysters, scallops, lamb neck, mushrooms, shishito peppers, ribeye, octopus, veal shortbread, beef tartare, egg and grain, crudo hamachi,  sunchokes, and sardines. I loved everything with one exception: the sardines. They were better than other sardines I've had, but I'm really not a fan of sardines.   If I had to pick my favorite dishes, I would pick the scallops, the Tempura Maitake (mushrooms), the beef tartare, and the Spanish Octopus as my top 4. I would order all of it again though (minus the sardines).   They also brought me a complementary squash dessert for my birthday which was amazing.   This style of food is not something you'll find elsewhere in Charlotte. The plating is gorgeous. I honestly had no idea what I was eating most of the time (even after they explained the dish), but I didn't care because it was delicious. The preparation styles were incredibly unique.   We also got a couple of cocktails -- Putting Down Roots and the South Mint 75. They were some of the best cocktails I've ever had. Incredibly unique and delicious.   The price is on the higher side, but I would expect it to be a lot higher for the quality of food that's being served. Small plates are about $10-20 and they recommend at least 2-3 per person. We paid about $50 per person including tip and cocktails (only half of us got a cocktail). Other small plates restaurants around here are much more expensive for not nearly as good of food.   I think our group size was less than ideal. I think you're better off coming with 2-4 people. The service was great and they were very accommodating to us, but figuring out how to share and split checks with that many people is hard.   I'd agree that this is Charlotte's best restaurant. I don't know anywhere else where I could order everything on the menu and love it all. Everyone should definitely give this place a try!",

    "text": "Food-wise I can definitely understand why people are raving about this place. I'm pretty picky and at least half their dishes are a hit for me (and I ordered more than half of their menu...). Of course, I could definitely stand larger portion sizes here. They were fine for sharing among 2 people but would not have been good to share among three or four. Sharability is a must for me.   On the other hand, I wasn't a fan of the ambiance or the service. Although we were told we'd be served faster at the bar, and accepted seats there instead of our table, we couldn't get anyone to bring us freaking menus. Another party arrived, was seated, and served before we got menus. I even got up, went back to the host area to ask fo our menus, and was told to go away and that the bar would bring them to us. The bar did, eventually, but not before another party was seated and served.   The bartender/server we had also was rather snide. I'm accustomed to Charlotte's fancy restaurants being highly pretentious. But snide? In a customer service dependent location? That's a new one for me. At this point I was starving and not willing to go anywhere else until I had food in me so I stayed. But for the food, not the service. Also, later we we brought someone else's dish. It was obvious to us because we had just put in our order mere seconds prior and the party that had ordered it earlier was eyeing it hungrily. We tried to explain it to the not-our-bartender but he thought we were saying we didn't order it and that the dish was a mistake. He left it with us anyway. The other party had to wait for a new dish to come out which took quite a while.   Actually, that was another issue. At the beginning, our dishes were way too slow. Nearly half an hour passing between each one. Then at the end we had our last five dishes in front of us all at once--plus dessert! And, with the exception of the dessert, we had ordered all our dishes upfront. (I admit early on that I intend to try nearly everything on a menu, and I mean it.) So, yeah, not thrilled with the pacing.   But I'm a food lover in the end. Despite the prices and the sizes and the lack of all of the drinks I ordered (from the menu!) not being available, I'd go back for a chill meal with another friend looking to try it out and see what all the hype is about. Not five stars, but nice to see Charlotte upping her game in a way that doesn't involve meat only, fried only, or beer only.",

    "text": "Bardo, oh, Bardo.  I can't really think of a better way to describe my experience at Bardo other than \"A-OK\"  There was some good, some bad, but it did leave my intrigued enough to want to come back at some point. There aren't many places like Bardo in Charlotte so my girlfriend and I were really excited to visit. After seeing the type of cuisine, it reminded us a lot of the restaurants we'd go to while in DC - whose food scene has been booming the last few years. Unfortunately, it feel a little bit short of expectations for both of us.   Let's start with the good:  -The Spanish octopush dish was top notch. It was served with avocado, chorizo, pineapple, and espelette. If you got everything in one bite, it's a 5/5 easily.  -The aged ribeye and carolina gold rice with a wakame chip. The ribeye could have done with a little more sear but the flavor was damn good. The rice with the chip on top gave it a nice seafood-y flavor. -The beef tartare was probably the best I've ever had - and I'm not a beef tartare fan. I think it came with like an egg aioli instead of an egg on top which gave it a fun twist. -The drink selection was pretty solid. AND the night we were there they had a special speakeasy themed cocktail menu. Pretty neat!  The not so good: -The scallops with persimmon - just a weird dish. The scallops were a little gummy and the persimmon just didn't play great with them. -As good as the beef tartare tasted, it honestly looked unappetizing. When it came out, it was very grey in color and I automatically told my girlfriend there was no way I was eating that. Luckily looks can be deceiving sometimes. -The fish dish. I forgot even what the fish was that we were served - I think monkfish? I know we ended our night on the fish and it was a disappointment. I wish I could remember what it was - I remember the broth was a 10 out of 10 but the fish and its accompaniments were just not good. Kind of a sad way to end things.  Aside from the food and drink, this place will run you a few doll hairs. I'm OK with paying for a great meal or experience, but Bardo didn't deliver as much as I had hoped in both food or experience. I feel like I got the DC price without the full enjoyment.   All in all, I'll give it a 3 out of 5. I know this menu changes seasonally, so I will be keeping my eye on it.",

I love the concept of an open floor plan where you can see the kitchen work its magic. The intimacy of the place, limited seating, makes you feel as if you're special and reduces the noise because it's not a swarm of hungry Homo sapiens.   The service was impeccable. From the hostess/GM/owner greeting you as you walk through the door to the bartender catering to my drunken needs to the waiting staff and their awesome overall attentiveness and knowledge of the menu. Probably the best service I have had in Charlotte.   The food was why I came and it surely was, by far, one of the best meals I have had in Charlotte. I tried a cornucopia of dishes such as (see the pictures and no, it's not in order)  1) beef tartare, 2) razor clams, 3) Spanish octopus (my favorite), 4) Crab , 5) aged ribeye , 6) white asparagus, and 7) Carrot Cake   **NOTE: see their menu for the descriptions   All in all, I give this FIVE  stars because IT IS one of, if not, THEE best restaurant in CLT! I highly recommend you go try it. O_o",

Firstly, the atmosphere is nice, but not remarkable. It's a (small) open room with a bar and an open kitchen in the back that you can't really see from most of the restaurant. The menu is tiny - there are about 10 items, so not a ton of selection even for looking to split with others.   We ended up having scallops, peppers, mushrooms and egg/rice bowl. The scallops were really good, everything else was unremarkable. Our waiter was nice, but again, unremarkable.   While I don't have anything bad to say, if I'm going to a place with $15 - $25 small plates and only a few items, I expect each item (and the service) to be out of this world. I just wasn't impressed.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I luckily were able to snag the last 2 person table on a Wednesday night. Overall we had a wonderful experience, but there were a couple hits and misses I'd like to highlight.   First the hits: the Tempura Maitake was the best mushroom dish I have ever tasted. The tempura itself was crunchy and salty and the brown butter sauce was to die for. There were also cold-ish sauteed mushrooms on the side that were super citrusy and fabulous. By far one of the best dishes I've had in Charlotte! We also loved our cocktails (South Mint and Cooling Effect), the beef tartare (looked unappealing but was delicious), the spanish octopus (the pineapple was to die for, make sure you get a bite with every component), and the aged ribeye (which had a fabulous hoisiny taste).   Unfortunately the two misses are what docked a star: while the scallops themselves were delicious, the accompanying persimmon sauce totally missed the mark and was way too overpowering. The cobia dish was also totally underwhelming--the dashi broth was tasty but needed an extra punch (maybe some acid? some salt?) and the cobia was just bad. We couldn't tell if it was supposed to be crudo or not because there were portions that were flaky and other parts that were completely raw. It also had no flavor so we were just VERY confused by the dish.",

My friend and I tried the octopus, scallops, shishito peppers, tempura maitake, crudo hamachi and the carrot cake. Everything was really good and by the end of it, we both were full. I will have to say halfway through, we talked about going to get sushi next door because we didn't think it would fill us up. We were wrong. It was just enough food to feel satisfied. I would definitely go back for the scallops, maitake and crudo, I'm just not sure I'm willing to pay the price. I very much enjoyed the open kitchen and seeing the woman behind the bar put the final touches on the masterpieces. I will for sure be back for another cocktail and maybe some nibbles at the bar.",

Immediately when arriving, the owner Jayson greeted us and made us feel right at home. The vibe is super chill and the staff was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu.    This was by far one of the best meals of my life. Mike, the CO-owner/chef is dynamic. We started with cocktails crafted by incredible staff. I highly recommend the Mint 75.   We indulged with shishitos, beets, beef tartar, sea trout, octopus and we wish we had room for more.  Next time I can't wait to try what we didn't get around too.   We can't wait to come back!   My husband and I just went to Bardo for the fourth time and I absolutely have to update my review. Once again it is by far the best restaurant we have ever been to in Charlotte and dare I say anywhere?!We went on Friday night without reservations knowing we were taking a chance since we heard they have become more and more popular since they opened. We didn't mind at all and we found two seats at the bar. We had excellent service by the bartender and Jayson, the owner, stopped by several times to check on us and also give us further details about the elements of these masterpiece dishes.  This time around we had to get the tortellini and the shititos and then we tried new menu items including the sunchokes, the tempura fried mushrooms and for dessert we had the carrot cake and the new butternut squash dessert. Let me tell you. Oh my god delicious. We each had a cocktail - my husband having Professor Plum and myself having the Cooling Effect and the bartender let a sample of the new fall cocktail and by sample I mean she generously gave us a drink. We switched to wine and beer and had such a wonderful time. Before we knew it we were the last two people in the restaurant. We absolutely cannot wait to come back. The food is out of this world, the service is unmatched and the atmosphere is super hip and fun. Thanks again for a wonderful night Bardo!",

My incredible fiance, without my knowledge, reached out to Bardo a few months after our first tepid visit, to inquire about gluten free options. He was pleasantly surprised when Jayson responded that, in fact, most of the menu is actually gluten free. Whaaa?  He suggested we give it another go and we decided to go with another couple, which I would highly recommend. The boys eat all the gluten and the girls -- not so much. So we were able to equally enjoy almost the entire menu and share plates. We absolutely loved the steak and the octopus was out of this world. I also could have (and might have) eaten all of the shishito peppers...  Now if I have to have one criticism -- it's that we required mis en place with every dish and our server never (without me prompting and asking) brought us serving spoons to share dishes. So I had to literally ask for a spoon every dish he brought out to us so we weren't using our forks since we were sharing all of the dishes.  The vibe inside as I stated before is wonderful, and I'm so glad that they have gluten free options.",

It's kinda like a little day trip feeling for me which is cool. I don't get that vibe anywhere else I go in the city! As others say, it's small. But who really wants to go to a huge restaurant anyway? It seems diners like to go around 8. A group of four of us went at 7 and pretty much had the place to ourselves. It filled up quickly though.  We started with drinks. My selection was exactly what I wanted; a Bad Habit - brandy, benedictine, aperol, orange, lemon and peychauds. Very nice. Served shaken in a coupe.  To share we got the hamachi crudo, oysters (6 with a lime foam on top), poached razor clam in a sauce that stole the show, shishito peppers and the scallops. I think the razor clams were my favorite but the scallops, albeit only 2 per plate, were served with a little bamboo rice cake the same size as the scallops. It was surrounded by coconut and Thai flavors. Pretty fun to eat. The crudo looked stunning, like a little island or volcano almost. It had shaved, frozen carrots which is a nice touch. I do prefer my fish a bit thinner. It was fresh though! Maurice was our server who explained the dishes well and was spot on when he saw we needed new flatware or plates.  I'd like to go next for a date night.",

The mixologist was very kind and knowledgeable. She made sure to come over and say hi, which made us feel welcome.   Food: Sea trout - our favorite dish of the night. The corn puree was so delish Lamb belly- tie for second favorite dish. The cocao nibs were an interesting touch Ricotta tortellini- our least favorite dish of the night. Needed more seasoning and flavor overall.  Shisito peppers- tie for second favorite dish. The smoky char and sauce over the peppers was so great! I could eat these forever.  Tart- underwhelming and not the finish we expected our meal to have.   Staff was kind, but I felt as though our waitress didn't have great knowledge of the menu. She seemed to dodge every question we asked. I anticipate and hope this will get better with time.   Lastly, the food is so fresh and definitely high quality, but dang is it expensive. I feel with the size of the plates they could step down the prices a bit.   We will be back, but we can't afford to be regulars.",
