    "text": "We had read all of the good reviews for this place and we finally had a chance to try it. The ONLY reason I am not giving it five stars is because they seemed to be ginger averse in my opinion, which is odd for a Thai restaurant.  We went for lunch and we were happy to see they had a nice crowd. We definitely want this place to do well and stay open. The Thai options in Ballantyne are meager.   My wife had the Pad See Ew and it was very tasty. I had the panang curry which was also very tasty but had no ginger in it. Ginger would have made that dish really pop. I also got the Tom Ka Gai (chicken coconut soup) which is my measuring stick for any Thai restaurant. If your Tom Ka Gai is good, you have won me over. Theirs was good, but lacked ginger and lemon grass and they put a fist full of whole cilantro on the top. The cilantro really made the soup tasty, but it was gone in the first spoonful.  My advice would be to add ginger and lemongrass to the Tom Ka Gai... and chop the cilantro and onions for the soup (onion pieces were really large). Otherwise the chicken pieces were large and tender... and the overall flavor was above average.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Thai or is on the fence about it. The bonus is they also have sushi there, so if you are Thai averse and all of your friends want to go there, you can get sushi and everyone will leave happy!  Edit: we had take out from Bahn Thai for the night before Thanksgiving... these folks are SO NICE... I'd go back there just because they were so friendly and helpful with my large order. Additional dishes you need to try based on our new experience: Pud Prig Paow... REALLY SPICY.. I got it a little extra spicy and wow, was it good! Gaeng Keow Wang if you like a green curry.. my wife loved it.",

    "text": "The wife and I have been to Bahn Thai on a few occasions and have always had great food. I typically get the green curry, actually I have always had the green curry here. I usually get it 4 out of 5 spicy, which still has some pretty good kick to it.  It's always nice to ask for something spicy and actually receive it just how you like it. On my last visit, I also tried some of their sushi as an appetizer and the nigiri was all fresh tasting fish. The service has always been great as well.  The wife and I have recently moved away from south Charlotte, but I would not hesitate to stop in if we find ourselves in the area or even making a specific trip to Bahn Thai. I just have to venture out on their menu and get something different, but man those eggplants in the green curry get me every time.",

    "text": "Hands down the best Thai food in Charlotte. Restaurant is relatively cozy and tastefully decorated. Service is attentive and rather impeccable but the food is the True standout.   Though I've never been to Thailand (yet), I've been quite an aficionado of Thai food since I first discovered this wonderful cuisine in the late 80s. Thus, I cannot attest to authenticity, just to taste.   Every item I tried was perfectly cooked, flavorful and vibrant. I strongly recommend the som thum (green papaya salad) as we'll as the fresh summer rolls. For dinner I had trouble deciding which entree I enjoyed the most. It's a total draw:  I really loved all the entrees I shared.  The pud Thai (that's how it's spelled there), the pineapple fried rice, and the red curry with pineapple were all wonderful. And mango sticky rice for dessert was a befitting end to a terrific meal.   This was my first visit but I plan in becoming a regular. I can't wait to return.",

The chef asked if I had tried a different type of tuna from what I got, and when I said I hadn't he made me a sample of nigiri for that that type of tuna.  Ordered Pud See Ew with a 3 out of 5 on the spicy scale.  Thought it was great and a large portion.  The sushi chef also recommended a couple different sauces for me to try, and when I had to pack up some to take home they gave me containers to put the other sauces in.  Overall, really happy to see a casual Thai place pop up near my home.  Will definitely be back.",

We ordered pretty broadly across Thai staples and sushi rolls, and none of that was bad.  But you can certainly do at least as well among other local Charlotte thai spots (and Charlotte is hardly a haven for this type of cuisine).  But our daughter ordered a simple roll, which she had to wait for for more than 25 minutes after the rest of us got our food.  Our whole family was done eating before hers even arrived.  The server blew it off with \"the sushi chef is overwhelmed\" ... despite the fact that our other roll arrived on time, and we had a direct line of sight to the sushi chef to see that was plainly a lie to cover for having forgotten to put in the order.  To top it off, she refused to comp the roll.  The manager wimped out and avoided my obvious attempts via eye contact to engage him.  Weak, weak, weak.  Sometimes a restaurant has food so good you're willing to put up with poor service.  Bahn Thai is not one of those restaurants.",

    "text": "Three 1/2 stars First thing I noticed when we walked in was the decor in a West Elm style - possibly by an earlier tenant? A pleasant break from the usual Bangkok palace anyway.  The lunch specials were $9-12 according to the protein of your choice and include soup or salad. The soup of the day was egg drop something -no thanks- so we went with the salad, Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Tum Yum ($6)  and Crispy duck ($18) - same as we did in the last few Thai places we tried.  -The lettuce was crispy, the ginger dressing tangy and tastier than we're typically served. It also wasn't thickened as usual but that was fine too.   -The Tum Yum made for a fine medium spicy soup with many ingredients - mushrooms, shrimp, tomato etc- but no trace of lemongrass and malanga. The waitress told  me they don't put lemongrass in the bowl because customers objected to bits of \"wood\" in their soup but the chef uses it to make the broth. Maybe True, the soup had some nice flavor but my taste buds could not recognize it as Tum Yum : 3 stars  -the Pad Thai was very tasty but fell just a little short overall because there was no crunch to it (no bean sprouts or anything of the sort) and it was made with thin noodles instead of the wider, flat kind :  3 stars  - Crispy Duck: now we're talking! I've had good, bad and indifferent Asian duck around town but this one was the only one that came close to the experience of *Crispy* Thai duck. What looked like a whole half duck chopped into thick slices with a cleaver, crispy meat with lots of crunchy skin (like rind) to nibble. That's what I was looking for. The meat had been deboned, which I didn't notice at first because it had been carefully put back together for a traditional presentation -a compromise I can live with. Excellent duck:    Four stars  Now, I'm NOT going to claim this or that Thai restaurant makes THE BEST DUCK HANDS DOWN, nope! Apples and oranges, they all use different recipes. Thai Orchid's for one, serves a duck dish that's every bit as tasty -if not more- than Ban Thai's.     However Ban Thai was the only restaurant in my admittedly limited sampling which -in spite of claims to the contrary- actually serves Crispy Thai Duck .",

I thought the eggplant was mistakenly beef and I didn't eat it. I had extra vegetables and tofu as my protein. The dish was very flavorful. I would like to try the Gaeng Karee next.  I also had the Thom Kha soup, coconut milk with onions, scallions, mushrooms, herbs and dried chili.. And I got mine with extra vegetables- broccoli, carrots, bamboo shoots, etc. The soup is $5. I always get Thom Kha soup or a variation of it to compare with other Thai restaurants.  This restaurant stacks up very well. With that being said, price is higher end but definitely worth it.

I was very pleased with the food, i am already planning to go back and try other items :)",

I didn't get the ladies name who was our waitress, but she was so nice and very friendly! Since it was my first Thai, I had some questions and she was patient in explaining and helping me to decide what to try... it was very flavorful and just a little spicy, but not hot at all... Suzanne had the Charlotte Roll and her Mother had the Shrimp Teriyaki... Let me say, there was not one morsel left on anyones plate! We will probably go back this week! I recommend trying it at your earliest opportunity!",

    "text": "A 1 star, yes. On a restaurant that has so many great reviews. The reviews are the reason we tried this place.   We are always at viva chicken (they are a solid 5), and decided to get take out from here instead this time, change it up a bit. Well, never again.   We ordered a tofu fried rice, tofu pad thai, and an avocado and tofu roll. We got home (in Fort mill, so about 25 minutes away) and I opened up the sushi first and WOW, it looked like my 2 year old made it, and each roll was the size of a bottle cap. I didn't think an avocado or tofu roll could be messed up, but it was and I just couldn't believe it.   My husband called and asked to speak to a manager and the girl who answered asked why, and he told her that sushi looked like a child made it and was almost microscopic. She really could care less, had a major attitude, and didn't want to put the manager on the phone. She then made a comment like \"yea well take that to heart\" and my husband just hung up.  He called back again because he was in disbelief how this girl was talking to us, after we just spent hard earned mone and weren't satisified. He insisted we speak to a manager who was apologetic, and told my husband he could come in for a full refund whenever it was convenient.   We ate the dinner and the pad thai was so dry and was nothing but noodles and tofu, no oeanuts, or scallions, or anything else that was supposed to be on it. The fried rice was decent and just like any fried rice you can get somewhere else.   30 minutes later my husband gets a call from a different woman (this is now the 3rd woman we are speaking to) who says she will \"gladly refund the sushi but not the rest of our order because you only had an issue with the sushi\" little did she know we actually ate the food and wasnt happy with most of it. Anyways, we told her we were already promised a full refund for being disrepescted.   Apparently the woman who told us we can get a full refund wasn't the manager, and this woman would not budge on the full refund.   We finally said, you know what, you guys are obviously hurting real bad that you can't give us a full refund ($35) so don't even mind refunding the sushi. She said ok.   That was our first and last time there.",

Loved the mix of tangy flavors and crunchy papaya and everyone who tried it gave a thumbs up as well. (Also they were able to make it non-spicy upon request, which I loved because usually I love papaya salad, but can't eat too much because of the spice).  Summer Roll - Solid rendition, and better executed than the one at Be's. It's got a better a balance of ingredients inside the roll and the sauce on the side ads a nice bit of flavor.   Pad Thai - Found this to be too gloopy and sweet and it was definitely the least favorite dish at the table.  Among the other noodles, I honestly couldn't tell what they were but I think we ordered a few different versions of pad see ew / pad kee mow (wide noodle dishes). The seafood version was actually quite good, and if you like spice, ask them for Thai level spice and they will deliver.  In general wasn't super impressed by the mains, but would come back just for the appetizers.",

I stopped in for lunch one day.  While it was a pain to get to because of 485 construction, thankfully 485 will hopefully not be under destruction for too much longer and getting here will be a bit easier.  When I arrived, service was a bit slow.  There were 3 servers and a sushi chef behind the bar.  I waited about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me to seat me.  Once seated service improved a bit.  Compared to other Thai places that might have 5-8 lunch specials, this place has a bigger lunch menu.  You can order your meal with various types of meats or no meat at all.  You can also opt for brown rice instead of white.  Lunches come with soup or salad and a spring roll.  I went with soup and my standard meal for trying out a new Thai place, Pud Gra Pow which is choice of protein with Thai basil, peppers, carrots in a light sauce.  I also ordered it level 5 on the spice meter.    The soup was kind of meh.  It consisted of chicken with julienne strips of veggies.  The chicken flavor was overpowering.   The spring roll was chewy instead of crispy and lacked real flavor.   The meal was nicely presented and it tasted wonderful.  The spice level was about a 4 rather than 5 but still decent.  For my first visit I think there were too many flaws to consider this more than 3 star review.  But I will definitely add this to my list of Thai places to return to.",

The 2 stars comes because there was at least 1 piece of chicken that was definitely a spoiled piece.  It tasted as bad as bad chicken smells.  I discreetly spit that into the napkin.  The tea, mango with sticky rice, and water was not enough to get the taste out of my mouth.  Only 3 bites into this dish and unable to finish.  Let the server know the situation when she came over. She apologized,  took our plates, and returned with check.  No manager ever came to check on us to follow up.  I know people who go here regularly and love it. I will probably try them again.  I do hope they are more cautious with their raw meat. I would think that that chicken left an odor when it was raw that should have been discovered.  Also, I would suggest follow up with customers who have legitimate complaints.  I usually only give reviews when extremely favorable, I don't bash for poor service or food I don't like.  I just don't respond.  But after 5 days, I am still bothered by the lack of concern on their end and I am grateful I was not affected with food poisoning",

    "text": "So my husband and I moved from California to South Carolina this year. We both love asian food in general, and Thai is among our favorites. When we looked up Thai places, this one seemed the most like the ones back home so we tried it out.  We were greeted and seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Perhaps it is because we haven't gone much on weekends, but during the day or early evening, but I haven't had an issue getting seated. I am also naturally friendly and willing to say hi when I arrive to a restaurant. That being said, they have a wide variety of Thai dishes, and also a sushi menu.  While it is a bit pricey, you could share a single dish and you would be comfortable. The portions of Pad Thai are big and so the cost could be cut that way. The first time we came here, our friend and us shared 3 dishes and some sushi. Sushi, surprisingly, wasn't bad, although typically you don't go to Thai expecting sushi. The curries are all very delicious, we love Panaeng and Gaeng Dang in particular. Also the heat levels are hot (like most Thai food) and so a 3 is pretty good for most people who enjoy some heat with flavor. Of course, you could always ask for mild (like 1 or 2), and for their spice wrack, then add it in to your taste if you aren't sure.   While I have experienced a wait on ordering drinks, it didn't really bother me much. It wasn't that long, and I could have hailed the girl if I needed to. We also are very familiar with Thai customs and foods, since we've been to Thailand, so the menu is not foreign to us. That being said, the owners of this restaurant are not Thai, but do a very good job at cooking and their food is delicious and flavorful.   We have also ordered mango sticky rice, and thai tea. It tastes almost exactly like Thailand. Oh man I miss it! LOL  All in all, I would try it out and see for yourself. They do have lunch specials as well if you are trying to budget tighter. We have returned 4 times and really enjoy the food. Hope this helps! Go out there and experience your own adventure!  *Something to note: in most asian cultures, asking for your food to be changed and not pay for it is both uncommon and rude. I cannot speak for the general population, nor am I asian myself, but I have experienced it over and over again first hand. So take it with a grain of salt. Be willing to try something new, but have a friend to share it with, so that you can experience it together, and decide if you like a lot of different things. Be willing to ask the waiters/waitresses questions. They are willing to help you as best they can. Also, try not to knock a restaurant until you try a little of everything they offer. Sure, they may not be the best or have a Michelin star, but they might specialize in something that could be a real treat!",

The service was very attentive and friendly and our food was delivered quickly and prepared correctly.  We'll definitely be back to Bahn Thai.

For dinner, I ordered Pad Kee Mao, which was superb. I really can't think of any other place that I thought was better. 4 stars was plenty spicy for me! My fiance got the red curry with seafood combo and I think we were both surprised by both the quantity and quality included in the entree. The actual curry was delightful as well. It didn't seem to be as heavy and coconut milk forward as with other places.   We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, just had to subtract a star for the tough calamari and the price - still trying to understand how a party of 3 racked up a $100 bill at a Thai restaurant! Oh well, at least it was delicious.",

The Mr's Pud See Ew was equally well-executed and satisfying.  Our server was delightful and talked us into the mango and sticky rice dessert. Simple, not overtly sweet, and the perfect finale to a fantastic dinner experience.  I'd recommend checking out Bahn Thai on a date night before catching a movie at the Ballantyne Village Theatre, or after a pre-dinner glass of wine at Cru Wine Shop close by.",

As we were seated we had to wait for 15 min for some one to notice us and take an order ,as nobody showed  we had to call one of them to take our order.The lady who took the order was young.we ordered our food amongst which were tuna sushi ,thai basil & pineapple fried rice also.once the order was placed she repeated the order and she asked us for the spice level on a scale of 1 to 5 .5 meant thai hot, so we told her hot was good.once the food arrived we ate sushi and was good.With the same expectation i started eating pineapple fried rice and it was hot as hell and to confirm i asked one of my friends to take a bite and they had the same reaction too.The other fried rice my friends ordered was supposed to be equally hot as we mentioned hot for both pineapple & Basil.I took a bite of their fried rice it was not even close to Hot.So we called out for the young waitress and explained to her what the problem was her reply to us was\" when i say hot you should assume it is thai hot.Another waitress just stormed in with a slip in her hand even before we explained anything to her she started talking and telling us\"you asked for thai hot and that is what you got and that is what was written down while taking your oder\".When my husband tried to talk to her and tell her may be there was a miscommunication she told my hub\"HOLD ON\"in a very uncivil mannerly and to us that \"i cant help you if you cant handle the spice level\".Again the young waitress immediately came back with the bill and when my friend tried to place a take out for her son she replied rudely that the kitchen was closed.There was no prior notice that the kitchen was closing,in most of the restaurants they usually ask for last order before closing the kitchen.We paid for the food with 20% tip and left.There are many reputed restaurants where people replace your dish if you don't like it.Some restaurants don't even charge you for the food if you don't like it.But there they acted like they were serving free food and we had to jus eat without any complaints. service industry is all about experience and hospitality but in case of this restaurant it is just not True.The waitress did not care to replace the dish nor took it of the bill. This review is to help others and not for free food. Visiting Bahn Thai was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone.",

Our waitress was attentive regarding dietary issues for two in our party. That worked out well.   The appetizers of fried calamari and tempura shrimp were excellent although for four guests there could have been more of each. The crispy duck was excellent per two guests. I had the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. Excellent, not greasy and an abundant serving.  My wife had the Pud Thai with chicken with no complaints.   I had forgotten to look for the beautiful lobster roll with sushi & tempura pictured here elsewhere. I'll have that next time.    All in all a good visit with more to come.",

It ended up turning a once week spot for lunch every week for almost a year! Pineapple fried rice is amazing! Gaeng Mussamun is also amazing. Almost everything on that lunch menu is amazing. Even their Japanese food options and sushi is great! Ask for Mary! She's great!!",

We waited and waited. They weren't even that busy. No one looked rushed or running around. We were about to leave and finally a server came up to us and didn't even greet us. All she said was \"Ready to order??\". I didn't know if she meant for drinks or for food. We gave her our drink order and then our food. Right when we gave her our drink order someone came right after her and asked what we wanted to drink. Super confusing. We got our food at a decent time. I did not like my noodles. They were sticking together and there were way too many vegetables compared to noodles or chicken. My husband wasn't crazy about his food either. Our drinks were filled once and that was it. Their prices are more expensive compared to others. But the thing that would keep me away is the awful service.",

    "text": "We are getting to be regular pimps for Bahn Thai, continually bringing neighbors to try it out.  A number of people are afraid of Thai food being too hot or spicy.  To their credit at Bahn Thai they do reassure diners that the spice will be low, but, sad to say, the kitchen does, on occasion over dose and you get sizzler.  When that has happened, they graciously take the plate back and re-cook it for the low spice crowd.  On the other hand, if you REALLY want to light up your life they will bring a condiment tray to the table with four pepper varieties that will water your eyes as well burn your nostrils.  So go for it if you dare, although their five spice levels should please you.  Their volcano fish and ginger fish specials are very good.  The ginger fish comes with two generous half-inch thick cuts of fish with around a three inch diameter.  A good satisfying portion.  Service is so nice.  The wait people don't rush your ordering and will delay staging your meal so you have time to chat, snack, drink over an appetizer or two or three before ordering your main courses.  I like that as I dislike getting the main dish while we are still on appetizers.  Don't be afraid...come on in and enjoy the experiment without suffering bodily harm.  You won't regret it.  Just look at the reviews!",

I had chicken cashew and it had great flavor. Thai tea was also good. Then we decided to try mango and sweet , sticky rice. My first time trying this and it was great!  Who would think something so simple would be so tasty. I've also had Pad Thai here and it was good as well. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the wait for take out was pretty long. They told us about 15-20 minutes. It was more like 30-45. Definitely could've been worse but it was around 1 on a weekday and not very busy. Still food is great and the staff has always been very friendly.",

We started with the spring rolls, they were crispy, fresh and served with a nice dipping sauce, order came with 4, we could have easily eaten 8 especially since I only had the opportunity to eat 1 and a half!. For dinner I ordered Pud Kee Mow level 3 spicy with chicken. Noodles were perfectly cooked, generous amount of chicken and fresh veggies and not overly loaded with sauce. I like things spicy and the level 3 gave a good kick. BF ordered Ped Met Ma Muang level 5 spicy with beef... also excellent, as with my dish generous amounts of beef, fresh veggies and not overly loaded with sauce. We didnt notice much different between the level 3 and level 5 spicy so the BF would have liked it hotter. We both ended up with leftovers to take home and mine was even better the next day... the thai basil flavor really shone thru on the leftovers. I have already told two friends about this place and look forward to going back.",

He replied, \"We close at 9:15\", I said \"Oh, your sign says 9:30 as I take a seat\", Server \"Yea, but we close at 9:15, so we can go home at 9:30\", Me \"Oh, I work in the industry and I never heard of a business doing that\", Some guy sitting at the bar (appeared to be a manager) interrupts conversation and states \"If you don't like our policy you can leave\". ME \"Ok\". Walked out, now wonder why the place was empty. As, I walked out I noticed how dirty and un-kept the restaurant was and I thought it was a sign that maybe I should not have eaten there. If a business wants to close at 9:15, then put 9:15 on the door. Granted I was close to closing, but 30 minutes away for someone who was just ordering a single take-out dish did not warrant this treatment. Ended up going across the street to Midwood, having a great dinner and leaving $20 tip ($19 check) to a great service experience!",

I was super indecisive and not sure what I would like because I'm normally a picky eater but I wanted to try a Thai noodles dish.  I asked the very helpful waiter which he preferred between the Pud see ew and the pud kee mow and he said that if I can handle spice he recommends the pud kee mow.  So I got the pud kee mow with shrimp and no mushrooms and it was SO good.  I already want to go back and I was just there.  I highly recommend this place and I highly recommend you bring me if you go so I can have it again!",

I don't know what it was exactly, but it seemed like a spin on a chicken and rice. It was a tasty start to he meal. As for lunch, I went with the 2 sushi rolls and that did not disappoint. The sushi was very fresh and made to order. Each lunch dish also comes with a spring roll and it was just the right amount of crispyness to go with the light lunch.

It's possible that we just need to get used to the cost of food out here (as opposed to Southern California); but we ordered Pad Thai, Red Curry, Papaya Salad and chicken soup. My husband had iced tea and I had Thai tea. Our bill came out to $66. We'd have Thai food regularly in CA and we'd try different Thai restaurants to change things up, but I don't think we've ever paid that much for Thai food. One thing I thought was interesting was that they also have a sushi bar. I didn't see an itamae there so I don't think we'll be trying their sushi.",

Its a place to try if you love Thai food or feeling adventurous.",

    "text": "I was glad to see the place open on a Monday night.  We were greeted with smiles from across the room and from the sushi chef.  It was around 530 and only 3 tables occupied which had me concerned.  But our waitress came right over and took our drink order.   We ordered a couple of sushi rolls and a Spring roll.  Took about 12 minutes to receive (remember 3 other tables), but all the apps were very good. I ordered a grilled cod fillets entree and phad thai; my son had a dish with wide noodles.   They restaurant was filling up while we waited for our entrees.  Others were served before us that came in after our appetizers were served.  I was told that they wanted to be sure the fish was cooked.  About 15 minutes later four hot steaming meals came to our table.  My fish was great but coated with a slightly bland sauce, and I ordered it 3 chili style.  Side if broccoli was cold. I loved the phad Thai, best I've had in Charlotte.  Tender noodles, spicy peanut sauce with a hint of sweetness.   The others enjoyed their meals without any issues. Nice addition to Ballantyne.",

    "text": "My family and I have been going to Bahn Thai for quite some time now and we always have a great experience.  The restaurant is a mixture of Japanese and Thai Cuisine, and it does a phenomenal job with both of them. I am going to review my experience with their lunch specials (served until 2:30pm).  Overall, this is definitely a place to go for lunch specials if you're trying to get a lot of delicious food for a great value.  When we arrived, the restaurant was not too packed and we were seated immediately.  The ambiance was good and there are TVs throughout the restaurant if you want to watch sports.  The waiter was very kind and refilled our waters in a timely manner.  For the Thai Dishes, you have the option of choosing your level of spiciness (scale of 1-5). As someone who likes somewhat spicy food and experience, a 2 is enjoyable while a 3 is right at the point just before it becomes uncomfortable.  For food, we ordered sushi and their lunch special is 2 rolls for $9.99 along with soup and a  spring roll... pretty hard deal to beat! The soup was a rice soup decent, not too flavorful, but appetizing.  The spring roll was great and compliments well with the sweet and sour sauce. The sushi though (crunchy shrimp roll and California Roll)... was DELICIOUS!  I was surprised that I was able to get sushi of that taste and quality for that price.     For my main course, I had the pud kee mow ($8.99) with chicken since I was craving noodles and also since the dish was rich in vegetables.  For the lunch special, it comes with a spring roll, sweet and sour sauce, and soup.  The dish had just the right amount of noodles to allow you to also taste the vegetables, egg and chicken.  The sauce was tasty and made the dish complete.  I would definitely order this again in the future.    For dessert, we had the fried banana with ice cream which was delicious.  Not healthy, but you'll feel less guilty if you share it with someone else.  In the end, I left the restaurant feeling full and satisfied without feeling that I had just spent a fortune.",

    "text": "Let me just start off and say the Sakura Rolls are amazing! It's a white tail tuna wrapped over a roll of eel and cucumbers. The flavors and the fish were super fresh and amazing. The sushi are freshly rolled by the sushi chef in the back of the restaurant. My sister who is vegetarian ordered some avocado and cucumber rolls and those were also freshly rolled (since it was a custom roll not on the menu).   While the sushi was amazing, the Pud See-ew was okay/decent. I thought it was a bit too sweet for my liking and lacked a good amount of noodles in the dish so the ratios between the pork/veggies and noodles were kind of off. Usually their stir fry noodle dishes are excellent so I just waved this off as a one time mistake. The fresh summer rolls were good but also the flavor of sauce seemed a bit off and the ratio between the veggies in the roll to the shrimp seemed unnatural to a summer roll.   Lastly, the Gaeng Mussamun Curry was delicious! The coconut flavors were amazing and the veggies and chicken were cooked very nicely. Every time I come to Bahn Thai I always get their curry dishes because it never disappoints.  Overall, their sushi and curry was 5/5 and the other dishes were decent and below average compared to how good their food usually is. The service was also very pleasant. I'm definitely coming back soon for that Sakura Roll!!",

They can make your food any level of heat and they are not afraid to fire it up if you ask them to! They have daily lunch specials until 2:30 PM. All in all this is a good Thai restaurant and a great addition to the Ballantyne area!",

Here are some things that stand out to me: 1. Freshness!  Veggies cooked into dishes are still crispy and never over cooked and wilted down.  Everything is ALWAYS super fresh! 2. Their rolls and dumplings are always on point! 3. Their food is never overly spicy or salty.  Should you wish for more spice, they're more than happy to oblige, but they won't over do it to begin with! 4. Have I mentioned their soups?  Utterly scrumptious!  The Gaeng Jerd Woo Sen is delicious for dinner... the leftovers are delicious for lunch... get it with tofu... it'll make you LOVE tofu!!  5. Their sushi rolls are absolutely to die for!! 6. Service service service!  Their staff goes out of their way to make you happy.  From table service to take out, I've never had a bad experience here!!   I'm SO glad to have such a delicious Thai place so near my home!",

    "text": "Despite the dreary, rainy weather, had another tasty Thai experience here tonight. Also surprised to see how crowded it was when we arrived (considering its strip mall location?), but luckily, we were seated right away. As usual, I ordered the fail-proof Thai Tea...always delicious! Also, started with \"Lucky Bags\" as my appetizer, which were fancy, little fried dumplings all wrapped up (as implied in the name)...and they were perfectly delightful as well. Then I went with my usual Thai favorite, Pad See Ew, with Beef and Shrimp. Not sure if that was a custom order or not, given that I didn't even bother to see the menu! As expected, this entree was just as satisfying as the appetizer. But here's a warning... especially to Asians. When the waitress/waiter asks you for the desired spice level, always say 3 or less...given how they tend to bump up the spice level anyway.  Not sure if I'm often stereotyped to be super-tough when it comes to spice level (given that I'm Asian), but this seems to be a regular occurrence for me...of getting a spicier plate than what I asked for in most restaurants. That is, I asked for 3, but got a 5 in terms of being super-spicy. I even cried a little...but that's O-Kay since I was still able to eat it all. Still, I felt I should point this out...that it's better to play safe with the spicy level...if you're Asian. ;P Finally, the service wasn't great, but not terrible...good enough, considering it was a busy weekend night. Overall, I'd give this place 2 thumbs up...4 stars, in this case!",

This place was close to the freeway and had been reviewed buy a few friends so I decided to give it a try. I am fairly new to eating Thai food, but know a good pad thai from a bad one and so I was hopeful that this would be better than several, less-than-stellar iterations I've had locally recently.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately greeted and seated but I noticed it was freezing cold and it was uncomfortable for at least 10 minutes while I was trying to decide what to eat. Fortunately the restaurant was very clean and pleasant in every other way, as was my server. Pleasant that is!  I am happy to say that I was pleased with the pad thai ordered as well as the Philadelphia Maki roll I had as an appetizer. Both items came quickly and my pad thai was hot and had just the right amount of heat. I asked for a level 2, and it was enough that my gums were tingly 10 minutes after I finished eating. LOL The sushi roll was adequate for its price range and the fish was fresh and tasty. It was perfect for an appetizer or for including in a multi roll meal. I only wish they had garnished the pad thai with a few more fresh vegetables or something to take away from the fact that it was just Pad Thai heaped on a plate. A simple Improvement in presentation would go a long way.  The food was good enough that I will consider returning on my next trip to the airport to try something else, which is more than I can say from several restaurants I've tried recently! I give it 4 stars because I have not yet felt like it was out of this world. I will reevaluate after eating there a few more times.",

The favor is good, spice level 4, although next time I will try 5.  They serve a little tray with 5 different sauces, which I hadn't experienced before. Very delicious! Try the green one..yum! Very spicy though.  I had mango sticky rice for dessert..they used a green tea rice?! Why? I don't know because it was honestly disgusting.  Yuck! Days later I can still taste the grossness.  Please use white rice!  The service was good. Good sweet tea. Friendly and fast waitress.  The food come out very quickly which is great! The sushi was pretty good too.",

    "text": "Entering inside you would notice it's not any regular Dark and Gloomy Thai restaurant that has dimmed lights - instead it's the opposite - large windows, well spaced tables, spacious booths and a really big bar area. The menu is a regular Thai - Appetizers, Curries, Stir Fry and Pad Thai. One surprising section though was Japanese! And even more surprising was the Sushi Menu that came with its own card! I wasn't ready to try a sushi at a Thai restaurant so went with the usual Thai dishes.  We got some coconut soups to start with - The soup was flavorful but loaded with a ton of veggies which will make you 'eat' the soup rather thank 'drink' the soup. For entree, we decided to order three dishes and share between ourselves so we don't get bored. We got some fried rice, pad Thai and paneng curry.   The service was quick and our waitress kept checking our table often. The taste was not exceptional and rather blend without having any real kick to it. The Pad Thai seemed okay but it was too sweet for my taste buds. The paneng curry was a let down - felt like they added too much peanuts over coconut in the curry that made you feel like drinking a bowl of watery peanut butter!   Overall it is the kind restaurant where you could enjoy the ambience and the hospitality but the taste of the food is little too bland that makes you think about not bookmarking this restaurant!",

Perfect hint of spice in delicious coconut milk with peas, carrots, and eggplant. Over jasmine rice, this is AMAZINGLY good. The curry can't be beat. They can be a bit slow in terms of service, but no big deal. I never would have expected to find one of my favorite Thai places in Charlotte!",

I tried the lunch special - chicken and broccoli in oyster sauce. The soup that came with the meal was a rice soup. It was mushy and bland. Then they swapped it our for a Miso soup and it was not better. The rice was mushy. The chicken was okay and the egg roll was good. I left underwhelmed. About 30 minutes later I threw the food back up. Needless to say, I dumped the leftovers immediately. Probably won't try this place again. Server was great but food left a lot to be desired.",

My coworkers ordered the mango and sticky rice, said it was great but just needed a little more sauce. And pad thai portion was large and excellent.   For spice leevel it goes from 1-5 . 3 is quite heavy but doable.  I reccomend 2 for those with a hankering for spice but flavor as well!!",

The inside of the restaurant is really nice; much nicer than you would expect for the location.  They have a sushi bar in the back and then booths on each side.    We ordered miso soup to start; for entree we got Pud Gra Pow with tofu and Pad Kee Mao with tofu.  We chose a 3 level of spice (out of 5).  The miso soup was what you would expect but the other two dishes were outstanding and the portions were large.  I especially liked the Pad Kee Mao; the spice really kicked which is right down my alley.  My girlfriend loved the Pud Gra Pow and continued eating the leftovers 20 minutes after we got home.    When our waitress brought the check, she gave us a little after dinner drink for free (thai tea).  I don't know exactly what was in it, but it had the consistency of a liqueur and was very tasty.    Lastly, the waitress was great and went into great detail about the spice selections.  She even came back by our table to make sure we were okay with eggs in the Pad Kee Mao since she knew we were most likely vegetarians based on our order.    Overall, it was a great experience and we will return many times. On a side note, 3 level spice was plenty spicy.",

I was just here for the sushi and was both pleased and a little disappointed.  Here are my nuggets for consideration:  - No warm towel available to clean your hands before handling your sushi.  Overall not the traditional Japanese sushi experience, if that's what you're looking for. - Tamago didn't seem to be made there and was pretty bland as a result. - Maguro was very good.  Nice texture and taste with very little fat. - A really good family atmosphere.  Definitely a nice place to bring the kids.  Casual. - not a place for sushi snobs, as thats not their focus I believe. - Miso soup was pretty basic, mostly broth. - Overall, I'd recommend the place for a good, quick meal as long as you're not looking for the full sushi experience.

    "text": "Best Thai place in Charlotte, hands down! But I apologize to all my papaya salad lovers because I am not a papaya salad fan and I can not handle the spice so this is a review on basically everything else.   Service is always great and all the servers are very attentive and friendly. Yes, I've been here so much that I did my fair share of having the chance to get served by all of the servers.   Food is always delicious and consistent. One thing that gets to me about other Thai places in charlotte is that they are never consistent. Whether it's too sweet, salty, or way too much coconut milk in the curries. But bahn Thai always does it just right. And I would never in a life time think about ordering sushi here because... It's obviously a Thai place but the sushi here is pretty awesome. And the quality of the fish is great.   These are my all time favorite dishes.  Thai Tea- the legit kind too, not the bottle kind.  Sake Nigiri (omg.. melts in your mouth)  Salmon Crunch  Ballantyne Roll Bahn Thai Roll Gaeng Karee- Mild Curry (C6) even better the next day for leftovers Pud Woon Sen  Pud See Ew - they should rename this dish  Pud See Freakin' Yum!!!  CRISPY DUCK!!",

The papaya salad is so delicious, the sushi is pretty good too and my favorite it Pud Kuang Gaeng. It is soooo good! But be careful Bahn thai loves spicy!! haha We usually get our dishes at spicy level 3 and its pretty darn spicy!!   If you love thai food, def give this place a try!

    "text": "My cousin comes here at least once a week, so he HAD to take me when I was in town. I'm sure glad he did! They have everything: sushi, Thai curry and noodles, and even hibachi. Too hard to choose for the indecisive like me! I finally decided on the massaman curry. Delicious! The portion was big too, definitely enough for two meals.  My cousin ordered the hibachi steak. They even ask if you want to spice up your hibachi. Never heard of that. I'm not a fan of spice at all, but that's cool. I tried a bite, and although too spicy for my taste, the steak was juicy. So good that I wanted to come back the next day to get some (non-spicy)  for myself.  My other cousin and her friend both ordered one roll of sushi each. Usually, one roll isn't enough, and I order two. I was very surprised (and pleased for them) when their rolls came out and it was almost the equivalent of two rolls! Good thing I didn't go for the sushi and order two! Although I didn't get to taste their rolls, they looked just as good.  For dessert was the \"must-have\" sticky rice and mango. I was so full by that time, but couldn't help myself to the fresh mango. Yum!  Coming for a late dinner on a week night, the place was pretty empty. I don't know if that's the reason the service was so great from all the staff, or because they personally know my cousin who is always there. I believe it's the former because they seemed to treat the other customers the same way: friendly, having fun, and very helpful.",

Well, unless their sticky rice is to die for!  This place failed in their sticky rice, but, the Pad See Ew was spot on. Perfectly chewy noodles with a liberal dose of egg doused in a slurpy sauce makes this my new go to Thai place. Glad we moved so close to this gem.   Some of their seafood specials looked worth deviating from the pad see ew. Some day.",

The curry seasoning seemed to be a bit stronger than the many others I've tried in Charlotte. I personally loved the flavor but can see where others wouldn't. The portion size was just perfect for a lunch trip. Although, the itis--sleep that follows a great and normally large meal--still managed to catch up with me when I returned to work.

They were very understanding of our situation and allowed us to eat lunch in the restaurant while it was closed (they were there cooking for a catering event).  The Pud Thai (pad thai) was some of the best I've had in the entire country. I live in LA, and can't find pad thai this good.   5 star thai restaurant",

The Thai Chicken wings were crispy but could have had more of a Thai flavor, served with a sweet and sour sauce. Our entrees, which we shared were the Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, a order of Pud Thai, which we call Pad Thai? And a order of Pud ma Maung, which was vegetables and cashews and we had Pork added as our protein. All the dishes were very good. Although I never found a Cashew in the Pud ma Maung. The Fried Rice was especially good, just a perfect Thai flavor. We ordered everything with a heat level of #4 and it was not overly hot.

We came in for an early-ish dinner on a Friday evening.   The place is really clean and has great attention to detail. Plenty of tables, booths, and ample seating at the (sushi) bar. We grabbed a booth and our server promptly took our order(s).   We forwent apps and went straight to entrees paired with a few Sing Ha beers. Ordered the Pud See Ew, #2 spicy, and chicken. It was fantastic. Those wide noodles are executed so perfectly and retain such a unique and smoky flavor. The #2 level of spice was enjoyable and served up a balanced twinge of heat throughout. About the same as a moderate helping of Sriracha.   My wife ordered a veggie dish with the same wide noodles. Can't remember the name, but the flavor was so peppery. I'd order that myself.   Our server is was really rounded out our experience. She was so, so, so friendly and explained the menu thoroughly.   5 solid stars for this Thai joint. I'd head back in a heartbeat. Only wish it wasn't all the way down in Ballantyneland.",

    "text": "After all the hype, this place was a pretty big letdown. The ambiance is pretty cliche 'strip mall asian' restaurant. My friend and I shared the chicken lettuce wraps which were good, but nothing to write home about. For our entrees, my friend got the pad see-ew and I got the pad guey teow, both with shrimp. We both are not spicy food eaters so we went with the minimal spice level on both meals. Apparently no spice means no flavor at all! Both entrees were extremely bland, to the point where we had to ask for salt, pepper, and some spicy sauce to give it some flavor. The pad guey teow had a fishy taste to it. Not sure if this is because a couple of the shrimp hadn't been de-veined and cooked in with it, but it was rather foul tasting. I am puzzled by all of the wonderful reviews because not one of our plates were worth the money or even the meal. Save your time and go to Basil.",

    "text": "On me newfound never end quest for awesome thai food, I am happy Bahn Thai opened up and wish them much success.  They have only been open about a month and a half and have all the class of an established restaurant.  Saturday night, I called ahead since I hate waiting.  It was not needed however and we walked into a nicely decorated casual type atmosphere.  A few TV's were strategically stationed throughout which provided a nice outlet for ignoring your dinner companions if you so choose :-).  Sushi bar in the back and booths on each side.  Service was attentive which is very nice especially in Thai restaurants so that they can explain the level of spiciness and the intricacies of the dishes.  Our waiter was friendly and did a great job of recommending dishes to suit our taste.  When one of my co diners chose a level 3 for spiciness, I had to pop in and make them back it down.  First rule of Thai food is you can always add, but you can't take away you know?    We started with the Fresh Summer Rolls which were mui tasty.  Shrimp, lettuce, carrots, thai basil and rice noodles rolled tightly in rice paper with a well put together plum sauce on the side.  The plum sauce and the plump shrimp are key to making this dish awesome.  Next up, Pud Kee Mow, chicken.  Al Dente wide rice noodles, egg, bamboo shoots, peppers, carrot, mushrooms and thai basil.  This dish was nicely fragrant thanks to the abundant use of the thai basil and blended together nicely in a rice dish that did not disappoint.  Nicely flavorful and piping hot.  I'm glad I chose the level 2 spiciness because my pansy a** couldn't have handled anything hotter.  My only issue is that the chicken was slightly tough which is about standard for these types of restaurants so I'll probably switch proteins the next time I go.  That being said, I think Ballantyne has a big hit on their hands.  Great work Bahn Thai, see you again soon.",

    "text": "If you are craving some spicy Thai in a casual, yet well decorated atmosphere, look no further. Bahn Thai is new to Charlotte serving up some deliciously spicy dishes.   The spice level is on a 1-5 scale. Being cautious of a new place I tend to start on the low end until I get a feel for the spiciness. Wow, even level 2 is spicy! Ask for the spice tray too...4 different types of dips or dry spice to add flavor to your meal. Bring a few tissues with you as the nose starts to run and the eyes water because the cloth napkin just won't do. I ordered the Pud Thai and hubs got the Pad-see-ew. Both were great and plentiful! The sushi is good too, but upon return I think I'll skip the sushi and just hone in on the Thai dishes. When mangos are in season, I love to get some sticky mango rice dessert. Their version is pretty standard and good.  The service is good and friendly. Felt like our water glasses never got empty.   It's a nice, new Thai restaurant...and I left completely full and satisfied.",

    "text": "Saw that they had positive reviews on Yelp for papaya salad so we decided to head here for dinner and try it out since I was craving for it.  I'm a huge fan of papaya salad so I was supppperrr excited to devour it! However, it was such a disappointment.  The sauce was too sweet in my taste and wasn't as authentic like most places I've had.  (Pho Hoa and Viet Thai's papaya salad are more of my taste bud)   We also got the beef larb which wasn't terribly bad. Just ok, nothing really special. The tom yum soup was good, they give you a lot of meats and big jumbo shrimps which I thought was pretty nice. (Considering the price $7 for a bowl is kind of pricey for a small soup bowl) However, they do give you a pretty good amount of foods and service was good.   Love the decors though. Very clean and was still very new inside.  Had the papaya salad been good, I would have been sold on this place but too bad it didn't.",

    "text": "I Love Great Thai Food!!!  Opened May 1st!  The food was Very Good and based on them only being Open for 10 days it seems they have Great Potential!!!  Beef Satay tasted Great without the Peanut Sauce and even better with it!  Peanut Sauce!  This is the kind I Love!    Onion Carrot Cucumber side with the Satay was Very Good!  Pud Gra Pow - Beef with Thai Basil Stir Fry... Very Nice! Ordered with a Spiciness of two out of five...Two is quite spicy!  Spice level is similar to most Thai Restaurants (the Better ones)!!!  Brave use of Garlic!  More than most places I will say it is about perfect for me!  Crab and Cucumber Salad was very nice!  Thom Kha (Coconut Milk Soup) included more Chicken than most versions of twice the size!  More than one source if Spiciness gave this one a Moore complex flavor! Nice flavor though still needs some work  They gave me a Taste of the Green Tea Ice Cream!!!  Reminds me of the Fine Flavors designed for  \"i\" years ago!!!  It was that good!  My Waitress said they order it from a ________ for Japanese Food!  This version of Green Tea Ice Cream was PERFEKT as I have eaten! Described as \"mildly sweet\"... I thought it was Perfectly sweet with a fine Green Tea flavor with no overpowering Tea, tea taste!    NOT to the Onwers : : This Ice Cream does NOT need to be served with \"whipped cream\", nor Chocolate sauce!!!  It stands on its own very well!  OK you can decorate to sides on a dish without putting all that extra 'stuff'\" \"on\" the Ice Cream!  For Dessert they tempted me with a shot glass of Thai Tea, presented on a white dish !  Very Nice Flavor! They are SMART !  !   !  Thai Coffee was Very Nice too, though a distant second to Vietnamese Coffee!  Mango with Sticky Rice needs work and was better when we put some of the green Tea Ice Cream on Top!",

    "text": "It just didn't do it for me. All you Yelpers are crazy for this place but wow...I must have had a pretty bad experience compared to you all. We went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't terribly busy. The restaurant isn't big in the first place, and it was only about half full. We were seated and water was eventually brought out.   We ordered some spring rolls (I think...this was 2 weeks ago, forgive me!) for an appetizer and I ordered Pud Thai for dinner. The spring rolls were pretty good, and the sauce even better. Immediately after it looked like we were finished, our waitress ran to our table \"Can I take this from you!?!?!?\" \"...no thank you!\". A few minutes later \"Can I take this from you!?!?!\" \"...no thanks!\" She even put her finger on the dish before asking--my mom's biggest pet peeve. It is quite disgusting.  Our entrees came out, and my Pud Thai was...okay. I didn't love it, sure didn't hate it, it was just in the middle somewhere. My dinner was interrupted by a few more \"Can I take that for you!??!\"'s which was exceedingly annoying. Oh well. The portion was huge, though. I ended up getting a stomach ache after it was all said and done. My parents both said they enjoyed theirs, which makes me give the third star. I don't want to ding them too much on my taste buds alone.  Maybe it was a one-off, but I really didn't love Bahn Thai. I probably wouldn't head back, but who knows.",
