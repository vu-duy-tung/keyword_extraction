When I crave a hotdog, I want a firm dog that's snaps when I bite it. These were soft a pale in color. This place offers something very very far from a Nathan's, Sabrett's, Hebrew National, etc. The biggest sin..THEY DON'T HAVE MUSTARD!!!!!  They do offer some weird bright yellow stuff that may resemble mustard to those who do not know better. If you think French's or Hienz is mustard, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.",

I ordered the DDD combo (of course) because it is the touristy thing to do, but also because I enjoy being gluttonous. The cashier rang me up a different way because the daily special made it cheaper than the combo. My friend, who ordered the same thing didn't get so lucky - he paid the combo price which was about $1.50 more. The flavors were great but the texture of both dogs were not appealing. This was my first visit but my buddy had been to the other location before and agreed that they were soft and just mushy. He said he never had a bad experience at the other location. (Not sure where it was - I think south of where we were eating). The onion rings were also greasy and not crisp at all so there really wasn't much positive to take away from my visit. I might try again the next time I'm in Charlotte - I believe in second chances/bad days - but if they don't impress then, I won't be back.",

The Char Heel has chili and cole slaw while the Dirty Jerz is topped with mustard and sauerkraut. Both were extremely good and I'd get them again if I went back. I also had the house chips, which were also good but nothing out of the ordinary.    The food comes out very quick.  There was a group of 5 of us that went and we all had our food within 10 minutes.  Definitely a good choice if you're in a hurry.   I was expecting this place to also have killer sweet tea but that wasn't the case.  They also don't have lemonade, so those Arnold Palmer lovers are out of luck.",

It was a perfect afternoon/evening and the patio is a great outdoors space.  Conveniently, the hot dog was set-up out there.  On the bar were buns, hot dogs, chili, baked beans, relish, pickles, brown mustard, onions, and shredded cheese.  For $6 it was a great deal.  Our great stayed for the whole time the bar was out (5-8) and had a gluttonous amount of hot dogs.  The dogs themselves were very good.  The buns are thick potato buns which I normally very much enjoy but they are extremely filling.  The chili on the bar had an odd after taste for me.  I wish there was slaw on the bar too to do the full carolina dog.  I tried the onion rings which had a nice spicy crust.  PBR was $2 and they had them cold and for sale upstairs which made everything easy.  I'd definitely return to JJ's to try some of their more unusual dogs but the hot dog bar was a huge hit for me and my friends.",

Since that time I've been relegated to accepting my only taste of home would be on the very rare occasions I made a trip back North. Today, I learned that I was wrong! This place was awesome! The Sahlen's hot dogs were grilled to perfection and the toppings were perfect. It wasn't until after we began eating that I realized the onion rings looked like those served back home at Ted's as well. Definitely a must try next time! The staff was super nice and fun to engage with and all around it was just a great experience. I will definitely be making return trips on the regular!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to go to this place for a while. Unfortunately, the  establishment and food was just \"meh\". My first issue was the restaurant itself. My party and I walked in and observed unswept floors and a smell that reeked of dirty dishwater. The kicker was that the restaurant was virtually empty! Why?! Definitely not what I expected for a Saturday evening. An employee eventually came to sweep up the food particles and trash, but the odor was still present. I thought a food establishment was suppose to smell like ..ummm, I don't know...FOOD!...*sigh*.... I should have hit an \"about-face\" due to those things alone. However, my hot dog hungry teenage son convince my partner and I on giving this place a try. We halfway mozied our bodies to the front counter and was greeted by a rather friendly cashier. I settled on the Seasonal Sausage with an order of fries and their TRU ADE \"Orangeade\".... well, I really didn't have much of a choice because their fountain drink machine was out. My only other options were bottled sodas, Lemonade, or beer....*ugh*... While waiting on our food, I took a swig of the famous \"Orangeade\"...I looked back at my cup. Not in astonishment, but feeling hella ripped off! * insert my WTF face here*...That ish tasted like water-down Kool-Aide minus the sugar! The only thing that made it \"orange\" was the color and the bits of pulp flying around in it! Oranges sacrifice themselves for this?! So disrespectful....Anywoo, our food came out within 5 minutes and once again the presentation was just \"meh\". I was expecting \"Hot Dawg Heaven\". But, my meal was stuck in hot dog purgatory....a dawg that was waiting to redeem itself... The chicken sausage was very pale. I know, I know...it's chicken...but, I was at least expecting some grill marks or a little char on the skin...*super sigh*...the caramelized onions on it was good, though...and the rosemary mustard let me know that it was trying to impress me...moving on to the fries...they were \"room temperature\" warm and a little too hard for my taste...my son polished my fries off, along with his fries and two hot dogs! However, a 15 year boy doesn't require much, especially when he's not spending his money...Overall,  I would recommend this establishment ONLY if you are in the area and hankering for a hot dog or you're a 15 year old spending your parent's money.",

We spent approx $43 and the food was very disappointing. It was our first time visiting after seeing on Diners, Drive-in, and Dives. I must say the onion rings were very good and that's it! The corn dogs were greasy, the sauerkraut tasted old, the cole slaw and chili just seemed flavorless. We really expected more from this restaurant but for us, we will not be returning. Also the guy that added the toppings to the order didn't have on a hair net for his beard and as we left, he was drinking a water bottle in the same location where the food was being bagged (near the food lamp).

    "text": "I went to JJ's this weekend for drinks with a large group of people. A few people in our party got hot dogs and seemed to enjoy them. The rooftop seating was pleasant, and there was a girl playing guitar and singing, which was fun.  However, some parts of our experience were rather strange. After a few people asked for Miller and Bud and we realized they didn't have either, we asked for a beer menu. It turns out they serve a lot of local craft beers (yay!), but they had one beer list for the entire rooftop seating area! Our server kept coming up to the table and taking the menu away from us every time she seated a new party so they could look at it. Then the beer list turned out to have factual errors--my boyfriend ordered a beer listed as an ESB on the menu and got quite a shock when they brought out an imperial stout--not what you want when you're sitting outside in 90 degree weather! (Note: this was not an issue of the server bringing the wrong beer--she brought the exact beer we asked for, but the actual menu was wrong!) I applaud the effort to serve nice beer to go with their fancy hot dogs, but if you're going to do so, you need plentiful and accurate menus.",

    "text": "The first exposure I had to JJ's Red Hots was at an event where they were providing samples. My own internal monologue went a little something like this \"Hot dogs ... seriously?\" Oh, how wrong I was completely wrong!   The gentleman behind the counter slinging these tasty delights at me just so happened to be the composer / creator on the main features in these entrees. He had magically worked his own little twist in to the Andouille and Bratwurst, and I was digging it. In the back of my mind I thought that this may be a fluke. I bet this guy brought the best of the best just to lure in new clientele. There's no way it's like this all the time. So, I decided to swing by the establishment and see if this joint is the real deal. The first words out of my mouth as I walked through the door was a little like Keanu Reeves, \"Woah!\" The place was ridiculously clean, and I'm a neat freak. Even the restrooms were on point. That alone will keep me coming back, but they were able to mix a 50s malt shop decor with a modern chic twist which is very comfortable and welcoming. On top of that, the gumbo was amazing and the Andouille was just as delightful as before. During the dining endeavor, I was introduced to their pickle bar. If you're a fan of spicy foods like I am, you have to try their pickled jalapenos. They have a great flavor and pretty big kick, but not in an overpowering way. I hope at some point they jar these so I can take them home with me to add to my own dishes.  I will definitely be adding this establishment to my short list of fantastic restaurants to bring guests when they come to visit here in Charlotte.   I can't wait for the summer time to be upon us. I can get myself a succulent meal and hit the roof top to enjoy the fabulous weather.",

    "text": "First off, if you're looking for a good, healthy meal, then this is not the place for you. As advertised; it's hot dogs. Sure, hot dogs with all different toppings, but hot dogs nonetheless.  As expected, it's a totally casual place. You order at teh counter, and then they bring your order to your table. The booth we sat in, however, was totally weird. On the side I was sitting in, it was a normal sized booth, that could fit 2 people, but no more. But the side my husband sat on was about a half of a booth, so that only he would have been able to sit on that side. Weird, and kind of awkward.  I ordered the \"No. 1\" - which is topped with chili relish (which I love whenever I can get it), mustard, onions, and a pickle spear. It really was a pretty good hot dog. The pickle spear made it a bit difficult to eat (it pushed the dog out of the bun), but I just kept mashing it back in after each bite. I was not, however, thrilled with the bun; plain, like from a grocery store shelf, cold, and kind of doughy.  My husband ordered the Cheese Coney, and I had a bite of that, too. That one was also pretty good; topped with chili, cheese and onions.   The 2 of us split an order of their homemade chips, and there were more than enough to share in that order. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The chips were hot and crunchy and had a cool dipping sauce to go with it. My husband puzzled (a few times), about why they didn't even have fries available. I didn't really care, and I like the chips, but I do agree that a lot of people probably would like some fries with their dog.  I also enjoyed the small bar that had some free extras, like ginger carrots and pickled vegetables. I munched on those while we were waiting for our dogs to arrive. This was a really inexpensive, enjoyable lunch (I think it cost $11 for the both of us), and a good family place. I'm a little baffled at some of the excitement that I've read in the other reviews, because, I mean, I just can't get that excited about a hot dog, even if it's good, but I'd go back every once in a blue moon for a cheap, quick, yummy, totally unhealthy lunch.  There's not much else to say; other than: hot dogs.",

    "text": "I think my experience was like a lot of others on here.  I was really looking forward to trying JJ's, but was underwhelmed after the meal.  The decor is great and it's a cool spot.  I stopped in after watching my Noles get a win on a Saturday night and the place was dead at 10pm.  I guess a hot dog place is more of a lunch destination, but I thought there might be some other drunken college football fans looking for some food to soak up all the booze from the afternoon.  I kind of got the suspicion it was dead for a reason.....  We tried an assortment of hot dogs, the onion rings, and the nachos.  The nachos were on special for $2 and they were definitely the highlight of the meal!  I was expecting tortilla chips, but they came with crunchy kettle chips topped by beans, cheese, and salsa.  The kettle chips added a nice crunch and stayed crispy even though they were topped with salsa.  The hot dogs were 'Meh'.  First of all, they came with buns that were right out of the bag.  They weren't toasted or steamed or even MICROWAVED.  The hot dogs were also charred black.  I like my dogs crispy, but not completely charred.  Do you need to specify that?  I did order a 'Charheel', but damn.  Maybe they should rename the place 'JJ's Black Hots'.  The hot dogs themselves aren't even that great.  I like all beef dogs like Nathan's, but these tasted like the cheap 'grocery store' brand.  You know what I'm talking about.  The onion rings weren't good either.  They were served cold, but I had already eaten half of the small basket before I thought to say anything.  Remember, I was there after a long day of beer drinking.  There could be some potential here, but I will be going for the more expensive sausages if I make it back.  The hot dogs just weren't that great in my opinion.",

They use great buns and we did enjoy the onion rings. I didn't hate it, but hot dogs are so easy to make at home that I wouldn't bother coming here again. Maybe if I'm in the neighborhood again, I'll give them one more try! The restaurant itself was clean and interesting to look at!",

Hubby likes bratwurst.  We ordered a bratwurst and a Chicago style.  Opps - they are out of bratwurst - I thought the menu said housemade (how can you be out of them).  so hubby got something else - let's just say that if it's not a hot dog - it's going to be more than $6 and that is just plain expensive for something on a bun with kraut and mustard. My Chicago style dog was burnt, which seems to be common place based on other reviews.  I didn't mind but it was just ok.  I did like the toppings on the Chicago style.  The homemade chips are good. I think IF we come back, we will stick to the hot dogs and ask them not to burn them. Update: was contacted by the manager and he offered a free bratwurst when we come back.  I'll give an update when we get to do that.",

Onion rings were greasy and no surprise here...not much flavor.  Save your money--you can get a better hotdog at a ballgame.  Great location and atmosphere.

Hubby and I both went for the Char Heel Dog that had house-made chilli, slaw, diced onions (we skipped because we both had to go back to work) and yellow mustard. And you can get an all-beef dog! We both made ours combos; fries with cheese for me and tater tots for the hubby. Everything tasted great. And...they give a discount to CHS employees. Score!",

The fries and tots (free Yelp check in!) are also good. They also have a loyalty program where you can additional discounts and freebies - good for the wallet, bad for the belly. :-)  The rooftop is nice when the weather is good. The only challenge is parking can be a little hard to navigate.   Keep slinging them dogs , JJ's!",

It was quite crowded as it was Fathers' Day and all dads got a free hot dog.  Thanks to my son's girl friend, we had coupons to use also.  Your order and payment is taken at the counter.  You are given a number, find a place to sit and your food is delivered to your table.   There's a pickle bar and next time, I plan on seeing what that is all about. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Cheerwine is on the drink menu.  I live in PA and it is not available.     Great place to stop by.",

I'm not in Charlotte very often but when I return I'm definitely heading back to this place.  The charred weenie on my Char-Heel was a pleasant sight and the fact that the weenie sticks out both ends of the bun is a special thing. The toppings were not only fresh and flavorful but were also the maximum amount you can put on a hot dog before it becomes a hot mess. My lunch would have scored a 10 at the hot dog Olympics.   Ordering is at the counter where you take a  number for later delivery by a server. The toppings are already enough but there's also a pickle bar if you're so inclined.  All the accessories are easy to find and are offered in spotless efficiency.    The dining room is large and offers variety and comfort but If weather permits take the time to dine on the outdoor roof-top patio.   Great classic rock art adorns the walls here and there (bathroom) and the Guy Fieri  sheet pan is pretty cool too.",

It's on the short list of my favorite things.. a charred (almost black) hot dog.  Maybe I was dropped on my head early in life, I don't know, I have no explanation.  But JJ's did it for me.  And it was glorious!  They have great toppings, yummy milkshakes, and good fries.  I also tried their onion rings, but I wasn't that crazy about them.  Let's face it, I was there for the dog.  They also have some \"higher end\" items, like a salmon sausage and other 'brat' type things.  We really enjoyed our visit.  I can just imagine how nice their rooftop area will be in early autumn or spring.  They have a decent beer selection, and even have wine.

    "text": "I had heard about this joint on the radio about new successful restaurants so when I was in the area I was excited to try it out.   The dog of the day was \"Shred, Hot, and Bleu\". Right up my alley!  I asked about the dog size and the nice lass behind the counter said average size.  She was right and I was a little disappointed.    I figured one dog wasn't enough for a lunch, and at $3.99 I wasn't going to spend $8 on 2 hot dogs of average size (there was a 2 dog meal but it didn't seem like a value) I was certainly ready to be wrong!  I got the onion rings as part of the combo (which was a good deal).   I was quite disappointed with the dog, flavor and bun. There was supposed to be a hot sauce component but I never tasted it (I saw a tiny bit of a reddish sauce). The slaw was good and the Bleu cheese was just the right strength.  The dog itself was small and not hot (temp), the bun was 2nd rate (maybe a bit too humid? It didn't taste fresh).   Onion rings were hot and delicious.  Very light batter.  Little crumbly made it tougher to eat with a nice shirt on but worth the effort.   If the dogs themselves were better (a lot larger and hot) and they get the balance of toppings right then they may have a $4 hot dog but as it is now, I would pay $2.00-$2.50 for one.  So I came back about a year later and got a Sonoran w/rings (free rings thanks to Yelp coupon!).  The bun was much better this time, but the rings were greasy.  Dog itself (good beef taste) was really good (& messy!). Pickle bar was cool but no plates to put the stuff on!  Verdict: still overpriced for hot dogs but good for a change of pace.",

I got the Chili Cheese Coney without the onions, my dad got the JJ's \"No. 1\" Red Hot, and my mom got a Chili Coney without cheese and onions. We also got a side of JJ's French Fries. My dog was good but the chili was super flavorful, my mom had the same feelings about her's. I will say my dog was a bit more burnt that i like so i would have preferred a little less char. My dad loved how chard the hot dog was and thought the toppings melded perfectly. I would definitely go back but i'll give it a little bit of time.",

The Sonoran dog (with a splash of hot sauce and salt) is by far my favorite, and I feel compelled to order it every time.  Another favorite that I've had is the dog with the peanut butter, sriracha, and bacon on it.... Unbelievably good!  We've tried almost everything on the menu, and have never had something we didn't like.  Being from up north, I have high standards when it comes to hot dogs---- and I can honestly say that JJ's nails it! I also love that they use martins potato rolls (a True northern thing).  If you're looking for a delicious, affordable, and creative lunch/dinner option, check this place out! Best hot dogs that I've had yet in the south.",

I'm on my veggie kick and while they do not have veggie dogs on their regular menu, they offered a portabello sausage on the day I was there. Tempting as it was, I choose their chopped salad with salmon sausage on top. Even though salmon sausage sounds kind of funny, it made for a flavorful dish! I was really impressed at the size and quality of their salad. I also got a milkshake...it was more on the milky side than thick side.   The staff are really friendly and completely clean conscious. There was always someone cleaning, sweeping, or tidying up. The interior is fantastic and fun with excellent lighting. They offer a tremendous special on Fridays for an \"all-you-can-eat\" hot dog bar. Wow, go dogs!  I'm a fan and hope you are too!",

I had been seeing hot dog posts on Instagram from Good Bottle one week announcing their collaboration dog with JJ's.  That did me in.  I had to go & check it out.  I had the Good & Southern Fried Dog, a deep fried hot dog with bacon, shredded cheese, chopped onions, 'good' sauce (Wicked Weed BBQ Crema) and FRITOS!  with a side of fries of course.  It was delicious.  I sat up on the rooftop patio enjoying every single messy bite of that dog.  King of Pops can frequently be found in their parking lot, but don't fear if they're not there - JJ's sells the pops inside as well.    The only thing that could make this any better would be Dr Pepper.",

Well, let JJ's change how you think of hot dogs.   They use quality encased meats (hot dogs & sausages from Sahlen's in NY) and top them with well thought out combinations of ingredients, ranging from ordinary to extraordinary! You can get a plain jane hot dog, a Chicago dawg, or many other signature creations. Don't like what they have... fine... make your own! They also offer sausages, chicken options, and vegetarian options.   Service is great and they always have some sort of special going. I'm just waiting for them to add sweet potato fries or tots...

    "text": "Went here on the 4th of July for a few dogs, and I have to stay, I was impressed.  Due to the fact that I came there at lunch time on the 4th and that it was the Grand Opening, its no surprise that the line was pretty long.  Its set up so you place your order, pay, are given a numbered sign, and your food is brought to you at your seat.  I ordered the Char Heel ($3.49) which came with Chili, Slaw, Diced Onions, Mustard.  I made it a combo and was able to get onions rings which were great, and a refillable fountain drink for an additional $2.49.  I also ordered the The Whistle Pig, which came with house-cured bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, diced onions, and mustard.    I have to say, it took a LONG time for my two buddies and I to receive our food.  Once again this may be due to the fact that it was the Grand Opening and therefore somewhat crowded.  However, once our food arrived, I knew after the first bite of that warm, tender Char Heel, that it was worth the wait.  Its hard to pick one particular flavor of the Char Heel that stood out because they all perfectly complimented each other.  Not to be outdone, the Whistle Pig was full of salty goodness as the bacon added a unique texture and taste that you've got to experience for yourself.  I've really got nothing bad to say about JJ's sans the long wait.  The staff was very friendly, there is plenty of parking on either side of the building, the prices are reasonable and most importantly, the food is legit.  If you are looking for a new spot to Charlotte, I highly recommend JJ's.  PS: Dear JJ's Management, I know you guys are from upstate NY; much love for the Nick Tahou's sign you guys have hanging up.  But you guys have got to bring a REAL GARBAGE PLATE TO CHARLOTTE!  You would be the only spot in the south us implanted Western New Yorkers could go for a Plate!  Give it a thought...

A nice crunch to it from the pineapple. However because of the sauce of the salsa. It made my bun very soggy. It fall apart when I took my first bite. But I still like it tho. And the 2nd thing I'm totally in love with is their string onion rings. It's not big, and have a nice crunch to it. You can tell by how much I like crunchy foods. Customer service was great. They check on us twice. First by one of the staff then by the manager. I will definitely come here again. Except put the salsa on the side since I really do HATE soggy buns.",

July 4th 2012.... 1:59 1/2 pm and the Rooftop is BOOOOMING with an All-Drum Banging \"band\" (of sorts) - WBTV News Van taking up two parking spaces!  Many people parking way down the street and walking and waiting outside 40 minutes (including me) to see and taste what they have heard and read from the media saturated coverage (good job) of this grand event!  The OFFICIAL [in a very DEEP voice] so-called official [in a very whispered undertone] OPENING DAY! ! !  YAY!   By the time you are reading this the staff will be very familiar with the menu and you can order in your sweetest southern accent: Yes (some people are not sure how to respond to sentences that start with the word YES)!  In a more diplomatic (for me) manner of ordering I just pointed to the menu on the wall!  Maui Gold: Blackened on the outside and perfect on the inside... Loaded with Grilled Pineapple salsa and Chopped White Onion!  JJ's White Hot, stripped (almost it did have a bun) - They say this Brat is House-made, it was very tasty - Usually the \"JJ's White Hot\" has Sour Kraut probably Sauerkraut (not an angry German, uhhhh Deutschelander, I mean!  Sorry to the Germans).  On the Buns!  Martins Potato Roll, hummm...soft and an OK flavor, though NOT able to hold much more than a Hot dog without spilling some on your bling bling (if you know what I mean!   On a serious note...If you have never dined on this Roof-Top, especially at night, especially when the weather is just right, even when its Hot or cold, you could imagine how fun it must be or... you could find out for yourself!  The Orangeade and Limeade looked really Good.... I keep hearing about the Onion Rings (from people not eating anything on opening day [I'm guessing these are Investors or Friends of the Owner...How else would they know they were in line with me???)  They did a great job for this Busy and grand scale event, so I imagine it will continue to get even better!  If I give them 3 stars on \"opening\" day imagine how much you will like it!  Sub-Plot Staff seem very Nice!  Owners knew how to Hype-it up...Serious Social Media planning and I fond out about them from a Radio Spot...What I did not like were the people making the line outside Artificially LONG!  Once inside, a bunch of these people did NOT Order Food, nor did they Eat!?!???  I'm not kidding, they talked to the Dinning Guests asking them if they liked everything...These line Posers were simply in place to make a \"Can't wait to get in this place \"line\" to build the intrigue!  Bet it worked!",

My favorite is the Char Heel, all beef hot god, cole slaw, chili, onions and cheese. A traditional dog, but it always hit the spot. I recently tried the corn dogs, OMG, those are wrong. And when I say wrong, I mean so right, but definitely can be addicting.  JJ's offers beer and wine and has a great condiment bar with pickled veggies that always add a nice treat to any dog. Don't forgot to check out JJ's, especially the rooftop patio when the weather is nice.",

Grilled beef dog on a pretzel bun with beer queso, sauerkraut, mustard and sweet sauteed onions.  And it took me until Saturday to get there, but the wait was worth it. The dog was tasty and super fattening and very messy. The queso and the pretzel bun were awesome, but about three quarters of the way through, it collapsed. Still, very tasty.

The Hot dogs are fair .. but I know I can be biased... because no one .. and I do mean no one... can ever make me a better HOT DOG than Grey's Papaya.... But their no longer in business.... and their in NYC so... next best choice.... JJ's Red Hots.   Ambiance... Love it love it love it.... why???? - well I love to eat outdoors, and JJ's is situated on a busy street with spots for people watching... The beer is cold and local an the sun is usually hot on the top deck...   Frowns: - The first time I went here I was under the impression these hot dogs were all beef ( another northern thing) - they arent ... and that's why I think the taste is just fair...   The second time I tried the dogs, ... I specifically ordered a beef hot dog!!!!! Ureka!!!!!  So long story short.. this is a very fun and mildly friendly place... you, your friend and your kids will love this place....",

Sent them back because they were still white and crunch less, got the second basket and they were not quite as white but still crunch less, guess you can't expect much from a crinkle cut. That's okay though, it gives you a reason to get more onion rings. The staff is polite and helpful. The joint is always clean.

We were kind of hanging out waiting at the soda machine when one of the guys assured us that he would bring our food, even if we were sitting outside. He did, shortly after. (Confession: I was just standing there so I could keep eating their homemade pickles and picked onions- yum!!). We sat on the rooftop, which was perfect for a nice November evening. After two dogs and a side, we were stuffed.   I love the fact that this place really tries to incorporate other Charlotte businesses, whether it's local beers or King of Pops, etc. The service has been excellent every time I've been- everyone is super chill and patient, and encourages you to try new things! They have special dogs every week and deals every day but Monday.   Awesome place for a quick dinner, especially with kiddos.",

I went with the chicken sandwich with pickle and coleslaw, onion rings and an orangeade; came to $9 with change. The sandwich was on a hot dog bun - two chicken fingers, 1/4 pickle and a heaping amount of coleslaw. A mess to eat but still good. The onion rings were thin and crisp. A friend of mine got the nachos which I ate most of. Whoops. I will order them next time because the chips were thick and a perfect mix of crisp and chewy. Sometimes you just want nacho cheese, can't be eating clean all the time. I have to mention the orangeade was fantastic! It tasted like a better version of Snapple orangeade from my 90s childhood. I would go back for this drink alone!",

Neither will disappoint! As for sides, you can get fries, tots, onion rings, a side salad, etc. and no matter what you get, they are quite generous on their side portion! They also have a pickle bar to compliment any dog and soda/beer to wash the deliciousness down!   Definitely a great lunch spot in Charlotte!",

    "text": "Last week I had the opportunity to meet the owners, managers and staff at JJ's and to sample a good portion of the menu. JJ's is in the space occupied by The Drum restaurant, which operated from 1948 - 1995. Following the end of The Drum's operation several restaurants have opened and failed in this space. Judging from the new design, the level of enthusiasm and the quality of the food I think JJ's is here to stay!  We tried sample portions of most of the offerings and all were well-executed and tasty. JJ's uses smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's Packing Company in Buffalo, NY and the dogs are chargrilled over an open flame - yay for that charred smoky taste! Then come the toppings. There are eight signature hot dogs like the Char Heel (house-made chili, house-made slaw, diced onions and mustard) and my favorite: the Joliet Jake (Chicago style with tomatoes, sport peppers, diced onions, pickle relish, deli mustard, celery salt and pickle spear). You can also build your own with a long list of toppings, some of which are made in-house. House-made picked jalepenos and pickled vegetables are available at a self-serve bar near the soda fountain to top things off. I didn't try these during my visit but next time I'm definitely going to load up!  JJ's also serves several specialty sausages including house-made smoked salmon sausage with quick-pickled cucumber, red onion and herb aioli - so tasty and a good option for the non-pork eating crowd. The chicken sausage with grilled onions and bell pepper was another favorite of mine but the andouille sausage sliders take the cake with delicious cole slaw on top. Bratwurst, Italian sausage and a Polish round out the sausage menu. Salads and homemade chili are also offered so yes, you could even take a vegetarian here - the onion rings and desserts are great too!",

    "text": "I so want to like this place. However, my dining experience last night has made that a bit difficult. My son and I went for dinner because Wednesdays are Kids Eat Free night there. He got the Corn Dog Nuggets & I got the sausage special, The Royal w/ Cheese with no onions, a water and french fries. Our bill was over $10 - that's with his being free and neither of us getting a drink. Thought that was pretty pricey for a sausage. I looked after I sat down and the normal sausage combo, which includes drink and fries is $7.99. I thought, \"oh well, maybe this particular sausage doesn't count toward that.\"  When our food came his was hot and he loved it. I took one bite of my sausage and realized it was super cold. I took it back and the woman said she'd fix it. I will note that they had suddenly become busy in the time that we ordered and when I took this back.  I waited a good while before they brought it back out. My son had completely finished when they finally brought my meal back to the table. They did not bring me my fries back and there were onions on it. She said, \"Oh, was that not suppose to have mustard?\" Upon saying that I realized that the first sausage didn't have mustard either. I told her don't worry about it as my son is young and keeping him occupied at this point while I scarfed down my food would be a challenge in itself and I didn't feel like waiting another 15 minutes for another sausage. It was warmer this time, but not what I'd call fresh off the grill hot either. In fact, I didn't even finish it. I didn't go back up to say anything because they were so busy and frankly I was over it. I left feeling disappointed and still hungry. Pretty bummed about our experience overall and don't think we will be returning.",

We came on a Saturday about noon and there wasn't really a crowd so luckily we didn't really have to wait in line. I got a veggie dog combo with fries. One dog I got with rocket sauce and slaw and one with the cilantro lime crema and grilled onions and peppers. Both were amazing but the crema with onions and peppers was my favorite! My husband also got a veggie dog combo with fries. We were so shocked with how they looked and tasted that we went back in to make sure they were veggie, they were! We couldn't hardly believe it! We also got a free onion ring with our order because we used the yelp deal! The onion rings were ok but nothing I would probably order again, they were very greasy and the breading didn't stay on super well.  They had a good beer selection and we were able to get drafts for $2 each! Luckily on the day we went the weather was nice and we sat up on the deck to enjoy our food. We can't wait to go back!  Also, make sure if you live in Charlotte or frequent it often that you get a rewards card. If you get 50 points then you get $5 off anything, 1 point = $1... in two trips you could easily get enough points!",

I sampled the pickled bar, and got over-excited to see a sign that read pickled okra, but the container turned up empty. In JJ's defense, it was during lunch rush, and the pickled cauliflower (kind of) made up for it. Overall, the meal was just OK. My dog was all bark--it looked good, but I like the kind of sausage that \"snaps back\" when you bite into it. If you can't have the casing, though, at least have the burn. The dog was too pale for my taste. My hubby liked the bun, but I found it rather heavy and bland for a potato roll.  My side was the borracho beans, which boast a little beer and a sprinkling of shredded cheese. But even with a douse of Tabasco AND Texas Pete, the flavors didn't pop. It's a nice try, but for gourmet dogs the king is still Miami's Dogma, at least in the southeast. Shout-out to JJ's Dog of the Week, the Creative Loafing-inspired dog Fear and Loafing. You can't go wrong with bacon, crushed pineapple, Sriracha, no matter what.",

The food tastes delicious (I recommend the Char Heel, which is smothered in chili, slaw, and mustard), the homemade Arnold Palmers are great, and the dessert (King Pops -- the Banana Pudding flavor a firm #1 in my book) are the bomb! The service is great and the people that work there are super friendly.",

Order your dog traditional style, or go with one of their fancy takes.  You can also build your own.  They have a few other options to choose from as well, including sausages, salmon sliders, etc.  Take your tykes because they have little dog choices too.    The rooftop patio is a fun spot to eat if the weather is nice.  Be sure to stop by the pickle bar for a variety of housemate pickles.  Onion rings. Yes.  Fries.  Of course.  They even have a King of Pops cooler to satisfy your sweet tooth!  Hotdogs have gotten a bad rap over the years.  Don't view the hotdog as the underdog.  Go get your weiner on at JJ's!",

The only down side was the sides, we tried the beans and cole slaw and didn't care for either one. The cole slaw had no flavor what so ever and the beans were simply not what I was expecting.

The second dog was the whistling pig; it was good... didn't taste the bacon much. The chips were good and their home made buttermilk ranch is pretty good - I would slather that on everything. Both dogs had a nice 'snap' to them which to me is the mark of a good dog.   Overall a good place.",

I wondered over to JJ's Red Hots in the middle of the afternoon on a Tuesday (don't tell my boss).  It's super casual.  You walk in, order your food at the counter, sit wherever you want and they bring you your food within minutes.  Perfect when you need to get back to the office before people start wondering where you are.  You can't beat $2 signature dogs on Tuesdays after 3pm.  YEAH!  I had the Quarter Hounder with a whole lot of pickles from the condiment bar, and it was delicious!  Although it was too early to start drinking (come on, I do have some standards during work hours), they seem to have a great selection of local beers.  I'm pretty sure I'll be back on the weekend when it's warm enough to sit upstairs and throw back a cold one while enjoying the view.  If you're looking for a place to hang out with friends over some beers and some yummy unhealthy food (healthy eaters, you can have a veggie dog and a side salad)...this is the place for you.  See you all in the summer on the roof deck!",

Also this place has a neat outdoor space and several local beers and desserts to please all age ranges.  I have been here a few times and have enjoyed everything I tried. My most recent visit was to get out, enjoy the sunshine, and eat something other than soup after a bout with the flu. My wife and I ended up getting one of the No. 1 Red Hot, Sonoran, and the special dog of the day which featured candied bacon and pesto. All around, everything was great with the Sonoran taking the crown. I appreciate that they have multiple style dogs that you can mix and match with the menu. I recommend trying the veggie dog as it has become my go to. Pro tip: you can get a free fry when you check in with yelp. This place also serves local beers on tap and don't pass the sauce counter with home-made pickles and ginger soaked carrots.   My favorite part of this place is the outdoor seating, namely on the roof. Great place to sit and relax with a beer while you watch the commotion on East Blvd wiz by. Also during the summer they have a fair amount of live music. JJ's has filled a void in my life that I didn't realize I had, gourmet hot dogs. I look forward to my imminent return.",

Collard greens just make everything better. Go get this. Delicious.  My other dog: The Char Heel. Chili, slaw, onions, mustard. You can never go wrong with this Carolina classic.  The two dog deal comes with a side (I went with the beans. They were good, but I wish I had went with onion rings. Rookie mistake) and a drink for less than ten bucks.  Workers were friendly. Didn't take long at all to get my food. I believe it took longer to try to bust a left turn out of the parking lot. Oh East Blvd, you win every time.

We finally got Midwood Smokehouse to come and I'd say there is very little hot dog competition by the lake with a slight nod going to Matt's Chicago Dog in Cornelius).  There are many beautiful things about JJ's... The first is the Sahlen's dogs they use and how they char them just right before hitting the bun.  The second thing they get right are the myriad of choices for toppings on these lovely charred tube steaks of joy.  So many pre-thought out and yummy combinations of ingredients with my two current favorites being the Char Heel and the Quarter Hounder.  Don't like being put in a predetermined box?  JJ's has you covered with a build your own option.  Same thing if you don't eat beef (go Turkey Dog) or don't eat meat (Veggie Dog it is!).  If all this is not enough, they make their own sausages of differing varieties and the sides are homemade and delicious to boot.  The kicker.  One of the cutest logo's ever.",

I wanted something traditional and one to be daring.  I decided to try both the Sonoran and the cashier recommended the Brisket hot dog.  I love BBQ anyway.  I didn't have to wait in line or wait for my order long as it was made on the spot.  Young patrons 20 and 30 something's were all dining in on a Monday night.  Pricing is sort of fair for a non-traditional hot dog joint.  I want to go Hawaiian and come back for the pineapple dogs.",

Walking in, we found ourselves transported to a classic diner space. You walk up and place your order then have a seat. Thankfully we beat the lunch rush since there wasn't a line yet. Also appreciated how clean it was inside.  I ordered a Single Dog Combo with the Chili Cheese Coney Dog and subbed the fries for the onion rings. My brother did the same thing except he ordered the Sonoran (Southwestern Style). The Chili Cheese dog was delicious. The bun held up the dog and fixins. The onion rings were out of this world! Thin rings like onion straws that also reminded me of The Outback Steakhouse's Bloomin' Onion but a way better version. Excellent seasoning in the batter and crispy texture. Some parts could be a little greasy, but it's worth it. I'd come back just to order the rings but the dogs are also great.",

They carry the best horseradish mustard in Weber's. Their staff works extremely hard to make the best meals and experience. The locations are clean and well kept both inside and out. Yes they carry some great beers from Upstate NY like Genesee Cream Ale. They have been featured on Diners Drive-ins & Dives. The have a great owner. I have their shirts and a hat & a Sahlens clock. When in Charlotte it's a must go try!  They also have Frank the Tank which is the most awesome Sahlens hotdog tow along cart. You can get your parties catered by JJREDHOTS. Pretty cool!!!!

We sat on the inside which was well kept and clean.  There is, however, outside seating on the roof which is nice as well. The staff was friendly and served the food promptly.    I ordered the char hill which was extremely good!! It's the standard hot dog (homemade chilli, slaw, mustard, and onions).  They loaded my hot dog with mustard, so if you're not fond of it, please take heed or tell them light mustard.  My dog costs only 3.99 which is reasonable to me because of the quality!  I've also had JJ's No. 1 \"red hot\" which was great as well and has a little kick to it.  For this hot dog (and many others) there is a vegetarian option available.  It's labeled on the menu which hot dogs offer this option.  I found it neat that this restaurant was on the show Diners, drive-ins, and dives and they have daily specials!!!  I highly recommend this restaurant!",

You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. Even if you are sitting all the way up top on their rooftop patio!!   They are constantly dreaming up new flavors so stay tuned to their social media for updates. Their tots are amazing but onion rings were not. Their pictures looks great on the menu but they could work on the final products when they are served. However above all the flavor was on point which is all that really matters to me.",

    "text": "With a menu featuring eight unique chargrilled smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's Packing Company in Buffalo, New York it quickly became a daunting task trying to decide what we were going to try first. I figured if the first thing on the menu is named after the restaurant itself.. I'd be doing the world a disservice by not checking it out. So we ordered a JJ's \"No.1 Red Hot Hot Dog, the Chicken and Herb Sausage, Andouille Sausage Sliders, and Onion Rings.  The Chicken and Herb Sausage was very well received at our table and ended up being a favorite of the night. The sausage was cooked to perfection and the toppings were piled high. As for the JJ's \"No.1 Red Hot Hot Dog.. it was good. I guess I didn't realize that the Webers Mustard they use is a horseradish type mustard and not anywhere like the typical French's yellow mustard I'm use too. The first bite sent my nose into hyper drive and my brain scrambling to figure out what had just happened. I cant fault the hot dog for the mustard... there's plenty of people that love horseradish, I'm just not one of them. Without the mustard the hot dog was amazing. The smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's were chargrilled, juicy, plump, and full of flavor.  The Andouille Sausage Sliders were also on our favorites list for the night. It came out piled high with andouille sausage, creamy cole slaw, on toasted Martins bun and except for being a little on the messy side was perfect. The onion rings had a mixed reaction at our table. We couldn't decide if the batter needed a new recipe... or if they just needed some ranch to dip them in. The texture was right on point but we couldn't shake an awkward taste after every bite.  JJ's Red Hots also has hand spun milk shakes in four different flavors. We tried the mocha (which was delicious), the vanilla (which was a little on the boring side), and the strawberry (which needed just a little more strawberry). For the most part they were all delicious and well worth checking out.. .especially if the whether stays above 100 degree's like it is right now.  Charlotte is in desperate need of more restaurants serving up incredible food, at a great price, for the average person and JJ's Red Hots hits that mark. In a neighborhood over taken by platinum cards, vip parking, and fancy dining... JJ's Red Hots is a much needed breath of fresh air :)",

    "text": "For some reason I am always hesitant to go to JJ's, because \"it's just hot dogs\", but every time I go, I never regret it.  I have gotten a few different hot dogs, but the Chicago is my favorite.  It just has a ton of 'stuff' on it, so lots of good things are happening with each bite.  For a side, I highly recommend their chips, which are seasoned, crispy, and served with a nice side of ranch dressing for dipping.  The atmosphere/seating is really nice as well.  You can sit in a booth or at high tables.  The tables are also huge and have great views of the televisions.  JJ's would probably be a good place to enjoy some hot dogs and watch some baseball games...or any other sport.  I also loved the amount and variety of condiments/pickled vegetables.  Nice compliment to the meal.  Overall, the food, service, and atmosphere are quality, and it is relatively inexpensive.  I will definitely make some more visits back here.",

    "text": "I've wanted to try JJ's for a while so my expectations were probably a little too high. It's so hard to find really good hot dogs and I thought this was finally the hot dog haven I've been looking for. They were ok, but I was a little underwhelmed.   First, the hot dogs were barely warm, and the onion rings were just about room temp. To me fried food is nearly disgusting when it isn't piping hot. But on to the flavors. I really enjoyed the Char Heel, the hot dog had a nice crunch, and the chili was flavorful and savory. Not at all the cheap hot dog chili found in a 79 cent can. The Chicago dog was a little less enticing. I'm all for complex flavors, but with so many toppings they overpowered the hot dog. I felt like I was eating a meat flavored pickle and pepper in a hot dog bun instead of a hot dog with toppings. Finally, the onion rings were sweet and had just enough batter on them, but I've definitely had better.  The prices are good; two hot dogs full of toppings with a side and a drink for $9. The interior is very clean and warm, a mashup of old school diner with a slight hipster vibe.   I'd like to assume they were just having an off day, and the next time I visit they'll have the best hot dogs in Charlotte. For that hope, I'd come back.",

    "text": "For a hot dog restaurant, JJ's is pretty decent. In my visit, I ordered the double dog combo with the Sonoran dog, the Dirty Jerz, and onion rings. It was a little over $10 with a drink, which isn't too bad of a deal for a decent amount of food. I was particularly impressed at how quickly my food came out too; I checked out the pickle bar (Dill pickle, sweet pickle, pickled red onions, pickled jalapenos, and pickled carrots), grabbed a seat and the dogs were on my table in 3-4 total minutes. The dogs were decent quality, and the buns were really nice and soft. Turns out they use Martin's potato rolls, which are probably my favorite buns so that explains the high quality. The Sonoran dog was good but not great. The beans and salsa had just a hint of heat and added good flavor to the dog, but the cilantro cream was basically just ranch, and there was way too much of it for my liking as it overpowered everything else. I scraped off a lot of the cream, added a few pickled jalapenos, and the dog was a lot better. The Dirty Jerz was essentially the same: decent dog but nothing life changing. The sweet pickles balanced the sauerkraut well, and mustard is always perfect on a hot dog. The onion rings were pretty bad in my opinion. They're pretty greasy, thin, and VERY crunchy. I can understand why some people are fans, but I prefer much thicker cut onion rings with good onion flavor, and these were the exact opposite of that. Overall, my two dogs were decent but nothing special and the onion rings were just not my cup of tea, but the prices weren't bad, the food came out very quick, and the pickle bar is pretty cool.",

However I was pleasantly surprised to have the pleasure of trying JJ's Red Hots at a yelp event. For someone who normally does not like mustard, both dogs that were offered had mustard on them. Oh man and did I scarf them down like no tomorrow. Today I had the pleasure of having anything on the menu on them as a thank you to veterans. The quarter hounder, and was it delicious! Bacon, queso, lettuce, tomato. With a drink and side of fresh house made chips served with ranch. I ate every bite! So far it's my third dog there, and I plan on trying all of them. The signature is awesome. Mustard, relish, onions and a dill pickle spear. And I will say this is not how I would normally want my hot dogs. I've also had the whistle pig with bacon, onions, mustard, and shredded cheese. To all hot dog fans you must try this place. They are all also very nice here and it's almost like your at home. Thanks for the meal JJ's! I will be back.",

If you're on the fence between a single dog combo and a double dog, ALWAYS, always, always, ALWAYS go for the double.  You can try out two different dogs and really get the FULL experience.  Being from Chicago, I always get the Joliet Jake. I have very high standards when it comes to a Chicago-Style hot dog and outside from having a different bun, the Joliet Jake is ON. POINT.   I also tend to get either the Sonoran, or the Char-heel, both great options.  When it comes to sides - I always get fries. I have a guy in my office who LOVES chips, and he raves about their house chips. If you're into chips, get em. If you're not, you're a fool if you don't get the fries.

My side was their \"soon to be famous,\" Onion rings. Coke.   * * * * * LOVES * * * * * -- I loved the location, and the chill rooftop seating. -- I loved the restaurant's cool lay out, decor, and the high ceilings.  -- I loved the pumping blues music that puts energy into the room. -- I loved the friendliness of the employees, and the fact that they know how to smile.  -- I loved the cleanliness of the restaurant. -- I loved that the owner's/manager's are present and involved.  * * * * *  LIKES * * * * * -- I liked the taste of the Char Heel. The charred wiener imparts a delicious campfire grilled taste to the hot dog. My first bite was delicious, after that - meh, not so much.  -- I liked that the drink dispenser had Cherry Coke.  -- I liked the multiple seating options: booths, tables, and raised bar seating.  -- I liked that there was a fairly large parking lot.  -- I liked that the bathroom was clean. -- I liked their pickle bar. -- I liked that they had Dale's Pale Ale and other quality beers available. It was overpriced, but it was available.   * * * * * DISLIKES * * * * * -- I did not like the Joliet Jake Chicago hot dog. It was about what I expected - no thank you, Chicago can keep it.   -- I did not care for the flimsy, barely warm, super greasy, sad excuse for onion rings. They remind me of the onion rings that are designed to be put atop a burger at places like Pinky's. I would not order them again. McKoy's Smokehouse and Sauceman's Barbecue have FAR superior onion rings.   -- I cringed when I saw that my bill for two hot dogs, broken up, greasy, onion rings, and a soda - was over $10.00. A hot dog should never cost $3.49 each, much less $3.99 for the Chicago dog.   -- I did not like the fifteen minute wait for my order, given that there were only three dudes in front of me, inside the otherwise empty restaurant.    -- I HATED that there was a sign in the parking lot that said that I was subject to having my car towed if I parked in the wrong place. Welcome to Charlotte!  SUMMARY: An above average hot dog, selling for triple of average prices.",

There are so many choices of specialty dogs, but you can build your own too. Tell the cashier that it's your first time and he/she will do a great job explaining how ordering works and give some great recommendations.   They have a bar which includes add-ons like pickled onions, jalapenos, and \"Ogre Sauce\" which tastes like hot dogs, interestingly.   Prices are decent. For less than $19 we ordered a one-dog platter, a two-dog platter, and a soft drink. Each platter came with a side. That's about how much we'd pay if we went to Chipotle, and we got more for our money.",

The dog itself is whatever. It's a hot dog. But the toppings, and more importantly the combination of toppings is what takes these to the next level.   Graham was traditional and boring with his dog. He had the Char-heel, which was a combination of slaw, chili, raw onions and mustard. I loathe all of those toppings, so I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. But in his words it was \"effing delicious\".   I had the dog of the week (the big cheesy), and oh baby... It was topped with bacon, jalepeno pimento cheese & pickled jalepeno. One word to describe it: epic. The pimento cheese was so good. It's not a combination I would have ever put together on my own, but it definitely worked!   We both had our dogs with chili cheese fries (which were fantastic) and best of all, it was SO CHEAP! $15 for everything, including two sodas.",

The Char Heel dog was ok, nothing to rave about. The relish on the Dirty Jerz was not to my liking nor was the sauerkraut. I actually ended up scraping the toppings off. The actual hot dog had a nice \"char\" but didn't taste like a beef hot dog, which is the type of hot dogs they advertise as using. The most enjoyable part of my meal was the fries which were cooked and seasoned nicely. Overall I'm not sure why their hot dogs get such rave reviews. Maybe Im just picky. With that stated its definitely Not a place I would go to for a good sloppy hot dog.",

It's what I look forward to the most upon each visit.   Recently, I checked out the dog with peanut butter, sriracha, and bacon. Ummm....yeah. I almost lost my mind it was so good. Anything that even slightly breathes that side of Thai/Vietnamese flavor.   Also, summertime calls for a nice, tall orangeade. The Arnold Palmer variety is rather refreshing, too.

    "text": "I LOVE WIENERS!  I like'em charred and/or grilled, not boiled.  Not ever.  Once you forget a wiener on the stove in boiling water and are reminded by the exploding sound, you will never eat a boiled wiener again.  I spent my tween and early teen years with season tickets with the fam to a AAA baseball team in Virginia.  I lived on chili cheese foot-longs for 4 months out of the year.  You would think I would have gotten tired of the dog.  Alas.... my love for the wiener endures.    Enter JJ's Red Hots.  I have been wanting to go since they opened, but it's location is just a tad too far for me to make it for lunch during the work-week, and my laziness makes it too much of a hike on the weekends for just a hot dog.  What do you do when you go into the office on the Friday after a Thursday holiday and no one is in the office?  You take an executive lunch and drive around Dilworth looking for wieners and inappropriate items from Paper Skyscraper.    My order of a chili cheese coney (no onions) with fries arrived promptly and smoking hot.  Good char on the dog.  Cheese was melting over the chili.  The chili was fine, nothing that rocked my world, but good enough, maybe could have used a splash of hot sauce.  I did the unthinkable to hot dog purists and dumped ketchup on it, but that's how I roll.  The bun was soft and fresh and held all of the ingredients in place so I didn't end up with chili on my rack.  Coke products to drink, including real Cherry Coke (yum!).  The fries were fine, nothing special (I will try the chips next time for something different).   The total for my dog + fries + drink was $7.01.  Good price for lunch and reasonable for what I got.   They have an interesting pickle bar.  I tried the quick pickles and they were delicious.  They also had ginger carrots, pickled onions, and .... other stuff (not sure, I wasn't in a pickle mood today).  There was hardly anyone in the place at 11:30 (early for lunch), I am sure everyone was dogged out from yesterdays July 4th festivities.  It was easy to find (if you are heading away from South Blvd, it will be on your right).  Parking, in typical Dilworth fashion, was a bit of an angled mess, but it looks like it could handle a pretty steady lunch crowd without getting too crazy.    JJ's gets a 3 1/2, which I rounded up.  I will be back to try other variations, along with their sausages and *maybe* even a veJJie in honor of our Yelpin' veJJie, JJ.  Nothing that changed my life, but a great place if you are craving a wiener.  Note:  A Ballantyne location is coming soon - I think I read towards the end of July 2013 after they get their permits and such in place.",

Its got Borracho Beans, Fire-grilled salsa, red onion, cilanto lime creme, and shreadded cheese.  It's as if you were craving some taco bell, classed it up, and on a hot dog instead.  Yum!

Trust me on this one, this hotdog has a good snap. They also have some good combinations. I had the Dirty Zerz which had sauerkraut, diced onions, relish, and mustard. Absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure why I couldn't give it five stars but something held me back. We actually met one of the cooks as we were standing outside. She was a fantastic lady who really seem to know her stuff.

It seems as they were closing up (chairs on tables , pickle bar empty).  I got the Chicago dog and it was pretty good. But, I actually like Steak n Shakes version of the Chicago dog better. Now the Whistle Pig that I got was awesome. Very good and I'll get that again. I also would like to try some of their sausages, chili and onion rings.   We'll definitely be back.   Right before our orders came out a manager asked if they could give it to us to go. I inquired as to when they closed and as stated Yelp had the hours as closing at 9pm. The manager said those were not correct and he will change it.   We were fine with eating the dogs outside. I'll note that while in the parking lot 3 other cars (about 8 people) arrived with people that also assumed they closed at 9pm.   In closing, I'd recommend JJ's. Cool place, nice employees and lots of varieties for your hot dog  cravings.   March 4, 2018",

They have plenty of options, you can pick from their menu or create your own hotdog. I rather creat my own since none of their options grabbed my attention. I went with chili with queso hot dog and queso tater tots. My husband had a combo with a cheese and bacon hotdog and a slaw hot dog with regular tots. The place was not that busy so the food came out fast. The tater tots were the best that I've ever had in my life!!! My hotdog was good but was not heavenly good so I had to take one star from them since they are supposed to have the best hot dogs around.  We will definitely be back, mainly for the tater tots, and I hope next time they surprise me with some wonderful hotdog!",

    "text": "Not a terrible experience, but by no means the best dog I've ever had.  Ended up here on a Sunday afternoon after a whole lot of walking at Freedom Park, mostly due to the convenience of its location. I'm more of a burger guy myself, but I hear good things about JJ's so I was excited to give them a try.   Not particularly busy when we arrived. The only time spent waiting was while we looked through the menu as I believe this was the first time here for all but one of our party. Quite a variety of choices, but I settled on the Chili Cheese Coney (minus the onions) fries and a drink. Staff at the counter seemed to be enjoying themselves and were genuinely polite. It's a fast casual set up here so I grabbed my little number sign and put it on the end of our table. Table itself was clean, but one of our group sitting a little closer to the window said the ledge right next to the table was super dusty. Not great. In the mean time I tried the sweet tea which was rather good. Well brewed adequately sweet tea is a easy way to win points with me.   Didn't have to wait very long for our food, always nice. First thing I tasted were the crinkle cut fries. I assume they're brought in frozen (like a lot of places) but they were definitely a step above what you get at the store. Nice and crispy. Unfortunately the dog itself was actually my least favorite part of the meal. For starters, despite the menu stating all dogs are served on toasted Martins potato buns, mine was definitely not toasted. I wouldn't mind on a regular dog, but when chili is involved a toasted bun adds some needed structural integrity. Speaking of chili, this was the main cause of my disappointment. No spice, very little flavor and upsetting levels of sweetness. The menu states it is made in house, but it reminded me of a bad store bought spaghetti sauce. The wiener itself just tasted like any old hot dog. Maybe it was the chili overpowering it but it didn't step up to the plate in terms of flavor.   I still had a pleasant visit but I attribute a lot of that to the company. I don't really have any plans to return here over other places nearby, but if I ended up in the neighborhood again maybe I'd try one of their house made sausages. Perhaps those have a little more flavor. My personal opinion at the moment is there are simply better place in Charlotte to get a hot dog.",

The food took about 5-10 min, which for hotdogs seems like a long time. I ordered a chili cheese dog, upon arrival I was disappointed because the cheese wasn't melted. Cheese just tastes and presents better melted, especially on a hotdog. I was hoping the chili would be hot enough to melt it if I let it sit there long enough but that was a negative. Anyways, the hotdog it's self tasted really good.  On a side note, the onion rings were disappointing. They tasted like the skins of onions? They were dry, shriveled up and greasy.  I'm not sure if we just went on an off day but it sure seems like it. At the end of the day it's just hotdogs so I can't be mad. They had other things we wanted to try so if we're in the area we might consider this place again.",

My strategy worked!  Got the double dog combo: Joliet Jake Chicago Dog (had to see how close it is to a real Chicago dog) and a Quarter Hounder. After biting into the Chicago dog I quickly realized that this is most definitely NOT a \"Chicago dog.\" This is a BUFFALO DOG (Saleen grilled dog) with Chicago style toppings. But was it good? YES! Authentic? Not at all.  The Quarter Hounder....hum. Well it was suppossed to basically be a Bacon Dog. Well it had bacon but the bacon was chewy and not crisp at all. Flavor was good but that bacon just can't be soggy and chewy guys!  The onion rings were recommended and they were of the very thin variety but very flavorful. Not as crisp as I'd like but the taste was there.  Now the staff was EXCELLENT! Rastafarian dude at the front counter was AWESOME! Super friendly and cool. Everyone served you with a smile. Place is \"Diner Chic\" and cool inside.  I will be back to try their sausages and other dogs. Just recognize that their Dogs are BUFFALO STYLE which means GRILLED Saleens. Very good indeed but don't expect steamed or boiled dogs.  Overall I'd recommend JJ's.",

Being a first time customer I asked for the run down and a suggestion. I took the suggestion and got the Sonogran dog (southwest), my husband went for the The CharHeel, and my little guy got the kids meal corn dogs.  We noticed the awesome prices of beer too.   We got our drinks loaded up on pickled what nots and sauce from the little bar. Once we sat down our food was ready. Normally I have time to wash my hands get back and read a novel at most restaurants...  Not today!   I got some onion rings to go with my meal and whatever the guy on here was complaining about was delusional! They were greasy & crunchy yea, but that's the damn style. Let the chefs make it how they want. This is 'merica right!!  The hotdogs themselves were like little works of culinary art. The flavors created a mind bending journey to the west where I devoured this angelic dog much like I imagine Kanye did after his mouth was opened after being wired shut. The freshness and creativity are much appreciated.    We loved the first round so much we spilt the weekly collaboration dog Jam Session... It was fucking balls the the wall delicious.   I could go on and on about this place but I will just be making the trip from Spencer Mountain  to check in occasionally to show my support.   We",

They seem to constantly be thinking up new ways to dress up the traditional frank. Grilled to perfection and with a myriad of options. They also have great house chips and onion rings.

Hey, I know people who will drive hundreds of miles to go to Buffalo to see family or even sick relatives, and BEFORE they go there,- they will stop off at Ted's to get their hot dog fix.That's how great it is!  So, when I decided to stop in for some hots, I was ready to be disappointed. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.   First off, - they serve Sahlen's dogs- which are excellent, and what Ted's serves. I had a dog and an Italian Sausage and fries, with a Coke. They weren't quite as good as Ted's only because they needed to be cooked a bit longer. The fries were crinkle cut and actually better than Ted's string fries, but I did not see Onion Rings, and those are excellent at Ted's.  Actually, JJ's has some interesting combinations that I will go back for and try as they are not available at Ted's.  The place has a small, cozy feel to it with low ceiling, and tons of fun's decorations. And the music playing was great. In fact, I had to laugh (happily) as I watched one of the young servers (a white kid about 16 years old) practicing his very hip dancing moves to a couple of the songs as he worked clearing tables and resupplying stuff. He was really in the groove!  It is a little bit of my former home (Buffalo), and I will definitely be back. Thanks guys!",

I was thinking one hot dog and fries might not do it but two could be a bit much so I opted for the Kaiser Kase Gedachtnis Wurst plus tots and a beverage; the sausage being more meaty and less bunny plus kraut and pickled onions and cheesey bits throughout. yumm! waited inside for my sammich to arrive and then went upstairs to enjoy a warm but breezy midday out of doors under an umbrella; pretty excellent alternative to eating street side or burning up in the car (it's a ways away from prying eyes and car exhaust.)",

The pickle bar is amazing, with dill pickles, hot dill pickles, and picked jalapenos, carrots, and more. Their hot dogs are creative and reasonably priced and I really enjoy their onion rings and tots as sides. They have a surprisingly good beer selection from the local breweries (local cans are $3 Saturday!). The only thing is that usually when I'm there I feel like I'm an inconvenience to the staff. But this isn't really a place you go for exceptional service! All in all, JJ's has great food for a great price and a really cool location.",

I actually was at a crossroads because I am also a big Crinkle Cut fry fan, luckily my husband chose the fries so I could have a couple of his.  Oh the problems to have, I know it's pathetic.    I have to give props to the cashier from NY.  He explained the menu to us and gave us recommendations.  He was so helpful since it was our first time here but certainly not our last.

    "text": "So...  ... From the get go, let me say that if you follow my reviews and check-ins, you know that I'm pretty partial to a certain hot-dog business at the corner of 4th and Tryon. That's not to say that I'm not open to other places! I was actually looking forward to trying what many people would consider Charlotte's best mass-market dog. I wanted to start by saying I'm first and foremost objective when it comes to business reviews, especially local Charlotte businesses. So what happened?  After spending a good 4 hours at Freedom Park, walking nearly 7 miles and burning 1100 calories, we had a party of 6 that was very tired and hungry. JJ's was pretty close and cheap according to Yelp so we decided that it was a great opportunity to diversify our weenie portfolio. Walking in, the restaurant is somewhere between rustic and retro. Honestly the decor would have been just fine if some of the more discerning factors of cleanliness were addressed. Tables seemed like they were wiped frequently, but the drink station was a mess, and immediately we noticed that the ledges above the booths were covered in an even layer of dust. Rocky start already, we were all glad one member of our household that has a chronic dust allergy stayed home.  I got two dogs: The Char-Heel (Chili, slaw, onions, sub Mustard for 'rocket sauce') and the Quarter Hounder (BLT with queso and Secret sauce). Somewhat redundant I also got slaw on the side, which I'm glad I did because it was actually pretty good!  First off, the char-heel, this Hot Dog was okay. No one at the table who got Chili was blown away by it. We all agreed the dominant profile was sweet, which was a little strange. The rest of the dog was good but the Chili just didn't do it for me.  The second dog had just too much going on to be able to describe a profile. The Quarter Hounder, like the char-heel, was an OK dog. Between the queso, the secret sauce, bacon, tomato, etc, it wasn't memorable due to nothing really standing out. On both dogs, I really liked the 'just-right' amount of char, unlike some at the table I can appreciate the flavor it adds.  The one thing I was really happy about was the pickle bar, oddly enough I usually universally dislike pickles. Something drew me to the hot dills and the picked onions and adding them to both dogs made them much better in my opinion.  So with all that said, hours after our meal I ended up very sick, stomach issues (not going to get graphic, but pretty bad...). My meals for yesterday were as follows: Small Bowl of cereal at 10am, then JJ's at 6pm. I have what I would consider a very resilient constitution, I can handle spicy/rich/heavy carbs with no issue, but last night something went wrong. Dehydration set in and then it was a rough night.  While I respect the reputation that JJ's has made for itself in Charlotte, I don't think I'll be coming back. I struggle to give any place a low-star review and in the moment it wasn't a bad experience. It's just what followed that sealed the deal for me.",

    "text": "The first things I noticed after ordering were that the cup lid dispenser looked dirty, and the area around the drink machine needed a wipe down. The metal number that they gave me to take to the table had ketchup on it. And the ledge along all benches and windows was just coated in dust. Further down I could see cobwebs. Not really starting off great there.   The Coney Dog didn't really wow me. It was just okay. One note really. The chili was too sweet and onions on it were placed on top in the very center. If onions are on a hot dog, they should be sprinkled all the way across it so they can be enjoyed with every bite. Instead, half of the meager pile of onions toppled off when I picked the dog up because they didn't have anything to hold them there.   The #1 claims that it has spicy relish. Which it just wasn't. I'd call it mildly spicy as the regular old yellow mustard had more bite to it. Grab the Tabasco, by the forks and spoons, you'll need some if you want some heat. The pickle wedge inside the bun is just a bad idea. The dog just bullies it out as you're eating. You could try to hold it in like I did, but you'll get coated on mustard and relish. The relish also brings a pickle taste to the dog, so let the pickle escape and eat it at the end. Aside from the pickle, the rest of the toppings were evenly enough distributed, though the bun was rather wet. This dog is definitely more acidic than hot.   After eating here, I just don't get the hype with this place.",

I like that the menu has Vegetarian options clearly marked.   The fresh orangeade is killer and I highly recommend it. They also have can and draft beer and sodas/tea. They even have glass bottle cheerwine!  They have a complimentary pickle bar! I loved the pickled ginger carrots.   I got the cheesy borracho beans as a side and on my dog- absolutely delicious.

Great location, friendly workers, interesting decor with a lot to look at while you eat, and most importantly, delicious hotdogs! They use Sahlen's hotdogs from Western NY which are the best of the best. Lots of great combinations and options, I haven't had anything here yet that has let me down.   To make this place EVEN better you'll also find King of Pops right outside with their delicious popsicles! Hotdogs, popsicles, ahh, childhood!  Give these weenies a try!",

Walked in Saturday afternoon, not really knowing what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with the cool, funky decor and menu board.   And it didn't hurt that my check in got me some free onion rings...whooo hooooo!  I decided to be my own chef and keep it simple with the Handcrafted dog- I chose deli mustard, onions and sauerkraut.   I didn't have to wait long and my delicious meal was HOT and ready, the bun was fresh and soft and didn't overwhelm the dog, the ratio of bun to dog was perfect. My dog was cooked perfectly, but I like a bit of char and crunch! The toppings were delicious. Again, not too much to overwhelm, it was just perfect!  I actually enjoyed the onion rings! They were huge, the breading was delicious and crunchy... and super delicious with ketchup.  Overall I was very pleased with my visit, and look forward to going back...I hear there is a dog wrapped in bacon that had my name ALL over it!!",

Didnt offer a friendly appology or offer to have us sit down but not order. Wanted us to stand out in the poring rain to wait for a hot dog. Very rude. I would rather eat a hot dog that someone had rubbed across the ground than to eat at jj hots. What really makes me mad is that there was so many business people that didnt correct the employee that it showes me that customer disrespect must start at the top. Dont go buy a dog at jj hotd i recommend quick trip or have your 5 year old cook one sure you would be more happy with that. Complete waste of my time.",

First of all, for a hot dog joint you would think it would be a hole in the wall or a cart on the side of the road. JJ's had a retro, old but fun feeling inside. It was super clean and very welcoming! They even have a rooftop seating area for when its nice out, which is almost all the time in Charlotte!   I got the Char-Heel combo (House-made Chili, Slaw, Diced Onions, Yellow Mustard on the hot dog, fries and a soda). At first, I was skeptical of having all those crazy ingredients on a hot dog, I'm a plain hot dog and ketchup person but it was the most delicious combination on a hot dog I have ever had! Side note - If you are from New York and you know anything about garbage plates, get this hot dog! It tastes exactly like a garbage plate!!! And on top of how delicious this all was, it's only 7 dollars!   The employees were all very kind. The woman at the register helped me to pick out which hot dog I wanted, she was very patient when we asked questions and very helpful. The boy who delivered our meals was funny and willing to do what it took to make us happy customers.   FYI - Thursday's are 6 dollar all you can eat hot dog bar! I will most definitely be going back for this sometime soon!   Definitely check JJ's out, its worth it! I know I'll be back soon!",

You can sub a vegetarian hot dog on any menu item. Not only that, but their chili is vegetarian as well! The hot dogs are pretty basic, but flavorful none the less. There are a lot of different variety's, or you can just choose your own toppings. So there is something for everyone on the menu.   Their sides are great! I love the cheese fries! Also the pickle bar is an added treat, with amazing pickles..and even pickled okra...if you are lucky!   Overall: Good prices, good food, friend/efficient staff, can't complain!",

    "text": "This place serves up some excellent wieners (and sausages), but an excellent wiener doesn't automatically insure an excellent hot dog - whatever version you're having - one of their Signature Hot Dogs, or one you choose to build yourself. The wiener is only part of the composition of a great hot dog, the most important part, but still just a part. The roll, the toppings (individually and collectively), cooking method, and finally the assembly process itself will determine the ultimate pedigree of the dog - Best of Breed, Mutt, or something in between.  We tried 3 Signature Hot Dogs - JJ's \"No.1\" Red Hot, The Char Heel, and The Joliet Jake (Chicago Style) - and I was underwhelmed with all 3 from the point of view of taste, texture, and composition. The very first think you notice when you unwrap the dog (any one of them) is the omnipresence of the color yellow (check out the photos) - the mustard, rather sharp mustard at that, is applied last, and with a heavy hand. On the first 2 Signature Dogs we tried, the mustard is applied to a large layer of slaw, and these 2 items overwhelm all other aspects of the hot dog - the excellent wiener gets lost, as do the other toppings, which are fairly small quantities to begin with - in fact, I don't know if I like their chili or not, never found enough to taste. These 2 dogs cost $3.49.  The Joliet Jake ($3.99) is not an outstanding version of the Chicago style dog. There were no whole Sports Peppers, the tomato was limited, and the Pickle Relish was bland, and the deli mustard was applied last and too liberally for my taste. I do not care for Potato Rolls, in general, and this one didn't change that opinion. All in all, these heavy hot dogs are overpriced, and do not rock you with flavor, mainly for the reasons mentioned. I would not order any of the 3 dogs we tried as they were served.  I went back, and ordered a simple dog with Sauerkraut and mustard, with the mustard applied before the kraut, and this was a very good dog, showcasing the excellent wiener, but cost $3.99 - very much over-priced. I don't consider this a hot dog destination kind of place, especially not in the Charlotte area, which boasts a number of outstanding dogs, include the Southern Chili Dog at Green's Lunch, a variety of good dogs by The Chili Man, and a number of very good Chicago Dog choices, including the outstanding one at Poppa's in Mooresville.  I imagine this place could do very well, it is the trendy kind of place some folks flock to - look at the success of Skippy's and their Pretzel bun in Winston - but I'll probably not be one of the flock here. Love the wiener, love that it is grilled, but the dog as a whole is another thing.",

    "text": "My usual suspects (Dion L. & Simone M.), along with my boyfriend & Dion's husband (we were missing Katie M.!) ventured out today to the grand opening of JJ's. We got there at 1:30 & there was already a line at the door!  We got in a little early & checked out the inside...wow! It's really nice inside - check out the drum set \"chandelier\" on the ceiling! The \"pallet\" is clean, nice wood throughout, old black & white pictures on the walls. While it's somewhat small inside, the booths are huge & have plenty of space. They also have table seating & a bar-type island table in the middle. As soon as you walk in, you place your order at the register & pay for you food. The kitchen space is open, somewhat. You'll want to go ahead & get your soft drinks at the fountain & have a seat. They bring your food out to you.   I settled for the Joilet Jake dog (Chicago style), onion rings, & an orangeade. Keep in mind, if you order an orangeade or lemonade, they make it fresh, so they'll bring it out to your table.  We didn't wait very long until we received our food. Dion got the coney dog & beans, Simone got the Maui dog with fries, while Shawn got the Joliet dog with onion rings & a strawberry milkshake, & Evan got the sausage sliders & slaw. We were all \"oooh-ing & ahhh-ing\" about our choices! The dogs had a nice char to them & all the yummy toppings made the hot dog perfect! The onion rings...ohhhh! They were nicely fried & seasoned with a spicy batter. The orangeade was so refreshing! I would have liked the option to have a larger cup, though. At least with a soft drink, you were able to get free refills.  Other notes: friendly employees, pickled vegetables & jalapenos, Mt. Olive full pickles & Mt. Olive bread & butter pickles are beside the drink fountain. Beware! Those jalapenos are VERY hot! Patio seating outside, as well as deck seating on top of the restaurant.  Their prices are pricey, my entire meal was $10 & some change.   Their marketing is fantastic! Their social media game (twitter, Facebook, instagram) is on point & they do offer to hold events at the restaurant. They also have cute t-shirts and hats for sale.  Hoping JJ's Red Hots will do well & stay a part of the community. If today was any indication, they're going to be just fine!",

    "text": "Hot DAWG!  This place has the best hot dogs I've ever tasted.    JJ's Red Hots is a fast casual restaurant for Hot dog, sausage and chili lovers.  Oh yeah, they also have salads but if you come here for a salad without trying the dogs first, there's something wrong.  I thought that when I ordered, they would take an already cooked dog and just add my desired toppings but no you get a freshly cooked dog which is why it takes a little longer.  They have various names for their dogs with various toppings including the standard, ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, chili and more.  And put them in any combo.  But it's not the toppings that stand out, it's the dog itself.  They are cooked long enough to give them a nice brown color and a great smoky flavor.  Toppings for the Carolina and Jersey dogs were good.  For the Jersey dog, I should have added some hot sauce to cut the sweetness of the relish a bit.  But otherwise it was quite tasty.  If you order the combo, your meal comes with a drink and your choice of 4 sides.  I went with the onion rings which were thin and had a nice kick to them.  They also sell beer, both bottled and local drafts and have a few wine selections.    Around the restaurant, the decor is black and red.  There is an old drum set turned into a light fixture in the dining room.  There's 2 TV's, several booths, tables and a 12 seater pub table.  They also have a small patio out back and the deck on top of the restaurant.   The staff is super friendly here and seemed to go out of their way to help you understand the menu and bring you things that you may have forgotten, like napkins.  In a space that has been so many restaurants in a short time, I think this might be the one that sticks around for a while.  At least I hope they do!",

So...son and I went to Dilworth for lunch.  This time I ordered the bratwurst and the Italian, like before and ordered a naked dog so I could really taste the basic product.  Also, onion rings.  Onion rings were good and portion plentiful.  And compared to previous JJ's experience were oily, but not saturated, were not a clump of rings stuck together, but were loose enough to eat separately.  Flavor was excellent and they were hot, not just warm.  Apparently Dilworth cooks to order without them sitting around.  My quality and taste standard is the Nathan's Beef Frank.  It is flavorful, savory, has a snap to the casing, and is a great dog.  Now I get it, that we all have different tastes.  My loves are your hates and vice verse.  JJ's is a good dog.  It came lightly charred, which is far better than one taken from water or microwave, was flavorful, but not savory and was fatter and longer than the Nathan's.  It WAS a good dog.  If I were rating Nathan's as an A, JJ's would be a solid B or B+.  Respectable.  For some reason the brat seemed different from the one in Ballantyne.  But it was A-OK, like this review.  Maybe my taste buds were off.  And the Italian was not only good, but dressed with the peppers & onions it also came with a really good mustard.  Excellent.  As to the service, the cashier  here spoke, answered questions and had, well, personality.  I will make another trip to Ballantyne to look at their menu board because in Dilworth the menus had lots of description.  In fact, there were four people standing inline and I asked if they were ordering and they said that they were reading the menu so we joined them.  Once at the cashier we had our questions set and completed our orders quickly.  So as a guy who eats about 4 hot dogs annually, JJ's is A-OK.  Am amazed at the 5-star ratings and rave reviews, but accept that hot dogs are not a big deal in my life, eating such confined to airports that have Nathan's and the occasional dog with grandchildren.    If you do want hot dogs, JJ's is THE place to go.  If you don't want the doctored dogs, just order a naked and put your standard condiments provided.  I most likely will up my rating for the Ballantyne location after I re-visit.  JJ's is a great place for kids who like dogs and both locations carry out what they do pretty well.  Did I get it?",

I know that is a pretty strong statement, but JJ's takes the simple concept of a hot dog and makes it something much better. The dogs themselves are TOP quality, the buns are TOP quality. Then the dogs are chargrilled, and the buns are toasted on a grill. That is hard to top by itself, but they offer topping combinations that take an AWESOME dog, and knock your taste buds out of the park.  Am I raving about hot dogs ? Absolutely ! Try them for yourself, and you'll be a believer.",

Of course with so much going on our expectations were high.  I had to go with the Char Heel which was delicious with just enough crisp on it.  The potato buns are a nice touch, but I wish they were grilled, too!  The chili was a great blend.  The coleslaw was a good Southern flavor, but not enough onions.  Good, delicious, savory yellow mustard.  A definite hit.  The JJ's White Hot was - ummm - not a favorite.  My brat was smallish & overcooked & my sweetie's was way larger & undercooked.  We left half of both of them.  We were confused by what was Dusted on the Shoestring Fries?   We even asked & they said the salt is the dust...???whaaaa???  Just call them Shoestring Fries & we can assume they're salted.  I guess I was just looking for garlic powder or some other seasoning.  (it was also a small portion & they must have sat for awhile before we got them)  Overall it's a nice addition to the area - although now I'm on a mission to try all the hot dogs in the area to make a True comparison!",

My wife and I had the JJs White Hots and my children had hot dogs. We had the onion rings and french fries.  The White Hots were a little small considering the price but were tasty.  My children were not very enthusiastic in their comments regarding the hot dogs.  The onion rings were good but the french fries had nothing special about them.  They were very plain.  The soft drink selection was not very expansive.  A lot of the new self-serve places are using the touch-screen machines that give you a wide variety of drinks.  It is a little expensive for hot dogs and bratwursts.  The White Hot upgrade to a combo that includes the fries or onion rings and a drink is about $10.00.  Check the menu before you go because it is limited.  I expected more than was offered there and all of us left the restaurant agreeing that we won't hurry back any time soon.  For that reason, I could not give it 4 stars.",

Pros:  the room, the bathrooms, etc. are well decorated and clean.  It's clear that the new owner has gone to great lengths to upfit his restaurant.  The staff seems friendly and nice.  There's even a take out window (which is opening \"soon\")  and a rooftop deck that show promise.   Cons:  the food is just OK and not memorable.  We ordered Coney dogs. First of all, the hot dogs are grilled--the skin on ours was overcooked and crunchy.  Since we were there in the middle of the afternoon and the place was clearly overstaffed, we couldn't figure out why we'd be served our hot dogs cooked this way unless it was intentional.  Secondly, if there was any chili our hot dogs, we couldn't taste it.  Very, very bland.  Thirdly, no french fries??? Seriously??? How is that even possible?  The onion rings were decent, but would have been much better if they had been accompanied by some ranch dressing--or anything to give them flavor.   I mentioned my thoughts to the manager who said he'd pass the information along.  Maybe we will give JJ's another shot in a few months after they've worked out the kinks.",

Hot is what it was, spicy and the pickles added an awkward, but good touch. The coleslaw, bland. I think KFC has better coleslaw that what I just ate from here. The beers on draft, all four, are local, NoDa Brews, which are of course yummy. Probably the only thing I enjoyed. Don't get me started on the staff, who weren't so welcoming and seemed bored out of their minds, as they stood there, with the manager I'm assuming, watching tv.

They really pile on the condiments at this place and they also have a mini condiment stand where you can add extra jalapenos and vinegar soaked veggies and such. The hot dogs themselves are kind of a \"mild\" red hot so they don't completely destroy your insides. The setup in here for ordering is kind of like a stand in that you don't have a server. You just order, they give you a number and run the food to you when it's ready. They do have a pretty decent beer selection as well even though it is limited. The whole meal cost me around 13$ for two hot dogs and a beer so I'd say it's a little on the pricey side for a lunch. All of the staff was very friendly. Oh yeah, we tried the house chips which were the \"potato chip\" style and they were good but nothing to really write home about.",

    "text": "JJ's may be serving red hots off of the grill, but their overall value and product is better described as luke warm.  In short, they grill up a competent enough dog in a great looking space, but be prepared to fork out a handsome price for the privilege.  A walk thru the front door leads to a relatively open dining room with a mix of booths against the wall, a centralized bar area and tables out on the floor.  Props to the central light fixture/insider-refence to \"The Drum,\" which was the original restaurant at this location.  You order from a central counter, where the menu is plastered against the wall .  The concept is informal and, aside from delivery of your order, everything is self-serve.  Credit is due here for a very polished and consistent look across the brand.  The focus, though, is mix of hot dogs and sausages.  All are chargrilled and then served on a potato bun.  The options are diverse and range from traditional to unique (e.g. a salmon sausage).  On my lunch trip, I tried the chicken and herb sausage which included grilled onions and peppers along with spicy remoulade.  It was tasty enough, but nowhere near a good value at $6.00.  It couldn't have been more than 4-5 decent sized bites.  Even the regular hot dogs go for $3.50 to $4.00 a piece and I would find it hard to think that just one was a filling lunch or dinner.  To make your 'red hot' a combo will be another $2.49 and that gets you a fountain drink and a side.  For my side, I tried the \"soon to be infamous\" onion rings as I was told they were out of french fries (how does that happen?).  While the batter was unique as it had the look and consistency of tiny corn flakes, my order size was small and about of quarter of the overall portion was only the flakes of batter which were heavily laden with oil.  This order was soon to be forgotten.  The other two options: slaw and borracho beans, though I have not tried them, seem lackluster when compared to the hype given to the fries and rings.  Hopefully the portion sizes are larger.  To tally it up, I was $8.50 in just for my lunch and felt like I had very little to show for it.  Was this meal truly unique, I might see it as a special occasion kind of place.  But ultimately, and the real challenge here, for this concept to work is for JJ's to differentiate itself from any other restaurant that serves a hot dog or a sausage.  While there are a few things here you won't find elsewhere, at the end of the day it's still a hot dog or a sausage and side items that are largely commonplace, all in a self-serve setting.  JJ's hasn't elevated these items or the experience to a higher level and, consequently, I'm left asking, \"Why pay the premium?\"  For these red hots to catch fire, something more is needed.",

Twice the price of a regular dog and less than half the meat. The amount of meat in each of the 2 sliders was less than a single Little Smokie link. Basically tasted like mayo and bread.

    "text": "First, let me state that I want this place to succeed.  It's in a great location and there's not really anything similar in the area.  Getting hot dogs on a Saturday afternoon has been a longtime routine of mine.  Pros: The hot dogs I got(the Char Heel) were fine.  Nothing really to complain about there.  Chargrilled and potato rolls, can't go wrong.  I love the location, the atmosphere, the patio, the deck.  I especially like paying tribute to the original tenant at that location, The Drum.  nice touch!  Cons: The main reason I couldn't give a rating higher than 3 is because they said they had taken french fries off of the menu.  How can you have a hot dog place and not have french fries?!?!  Perhaps the cashier misspoke.  Because considering the place was not even a week old, and to already take something off of the menu, seems like an odd decision.  My next complaint, and it is minor, is all of the references to upstate NY.  I understand being proud of where you're from.  Or even a \"themed\" restaurant.  But when you have a Char Heel dog, a Maui dog, a Joliet dog and a Sonoran dog, you lose a NY theme possibility.  When you're in the heart of Charlotte, a \"Go Panthers\" dog seems more appropriate to pleasing your customer base than a \"Go Bills\" dog.",

I was super stoked because this place seems to have it all - great vibe, outdoor seating, FREE PICKLES? I mean, come on. But when the food arrived, I was disappointed. The hot dogs were fine, but nothing spectacular. I'm hoping their sausages have something more special about them? The chili topping was okay but not fab, and the Dirty Jerz is just your typical hot dog. We got some of their special \"Rocket Sauce\" on the side, and it looked like vomit. Seriously, like a grayish-pinkish chunky mess. It did not taste good.  The onion rings were very greasy, more like onion straws, with no crunch or anything to them. Basically just thin onions dipped in oil. The breading did not hold together whatsoever.  The lemonade apparently has basil in it, but I couldn't taste it. Just was like a watery lemonade.  All in all, I'll probably give JJ's another shot, but with much lower expectations.",

If hot dog haters would get their nose out of the sky and try this place they wouldn't care less either.  The dogs are nice and juicy and and the toppings will make sure to shower up afterwards.  When you get the dog, don't put anything else on it other than jalepenos.  I feel that they come the way it is intended to be eaten.  We have always had good experiences here and their rooftop seating is especially nice during this time of the year.",

    "text": "Ordered some dogs to go (Maui Gold and the Char Heel).  I tried to order the Whistle Pig, but they were out of a key ingredient, so no luck this time.    Dogs themselves:  Both were very good, but not necessarily great, because, after all, we're writing about hot dogs.  The toppings make or break these things, in my opinion.  The Maui Gold with sweet and tangy pineapple salsa paired with the crisp diced onion and hot dog provided some unique flavors I haven't tasted before.  Buns were fresh.  Two thumbs up.   Service:  A little bit chaotic, but, this is, after all, their second day in operation, so I'll give them a pass.  There were plenty of staff members around, so it's not like mgmt has tried to cut corners.  They just need to settle into role and responsibilities a little and develop a better understanding of how to interact with customers (I felt like cashier was reading a script and the person handing me my food at the end of the counter was in another world).  I'd also point out the restaurant doesn't seem to flow very well.  Food is being carried by staff members to tables through the crowd of people waiting for to-go orders, which happens to be the same spot as the soft drink machine crowd.  I wish they could have spaced things out a little better.  Price:  Very reasonable.  $3.50 for a dog; add $2.50 if you want onion rings and a drink.  That's cheap by East Blvd standards.  Overall, I think any place with a line extending to the door has something good going on.  I'll be back, hopefully they will have worked out the service kinks by that time.  Dilworth workers just gained another great spot to grab a quick, but decent lunch.  Competition is good for all of us.",

    "text": "JJ's caught me by surprise and I couldn't be more excited.  If you haven't visited, you need to make it a point to check out this new hotspot.  Let me first start out by saying I have always been a little bias on my hotdog cravings.  For the past decade, I've loved Chicago dogs moreso than the Carolina style.  I did grow up in Statesville in the 80s and there was a place called Elliott's Old Fashioned Ice Cream and their ice cream and hot dogs were insanely great and memorable.  It was a classic soda shop feel and was very 50's.  It since closed after the owners passed away and I've been disappointed 95% of the Carolina dogs that I've had.  Enter, JJ's.  My wife got the Char Heel and Homemade Chips w/ Ranch.  I got the Chicago Dog with Onion Rings.  I ended with a Chocolate Shake and she had a nice import beer as their selection is great for this type of spot.  My Chicago Dog was fantastic and I have to say they have the edge in flavor over Matt's Chicago Dog.  That floored me.  The relish isn't the noteable bright green buy the flavor was fantastic.  Now, the Char Heel.  This is the best Carolina-Style hotdog that I have had since 1995ish.  As soon as I took a bite of this magnificent hotdog and it had that perfect snap, the flavors of the onions, chili and mustard sent me back.  Yep, I'm a little intense with this one but it's just that good.  The flavor was perfectly balanced and it brought me back to my youth.    This is located next to Lebowski's and the businesses that tend to go in here don't last long.  They have a great parking lot now and a rooftop patio so I'm hoping people take advantage of this place.  I know I'll be doing my part in hope they stay strong.",

Yes it's a little more than you'd spend on street meat hot dogs but then again it's flavor and style of the dog you are buying too.    I really dig the decor, very clean and refreshed and I can't wait till the weather cools down so I can enjoy the roof.  Another great thing is the chance for a t-shirt afer punching all the unique dogs on your loyalty card.  That's a great marketing idea!  I was also glad to see some decent beers on tap and the remaining beers are can only.    Can't wait to go back.",

Beyond dogs, they've got great drinks (house made orangeade!), other foods (chicken, smoked salmon, etc.), and they're very kid friendly. My son loved the giant crayon bucket and they even taped his drawing to the wall :) Plus, kids eat free on Wed, so, next time I'll be visiting on a Wed. I was totally impressed with the house made pickles (hot and sweet), pickled jalo's and onions, and ginger carrots. JJ's is comfortable, well decorated and clean, and the staff are friendly and attentive. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty, creative casual meal at a very fair price.",

Which by the way was not hot. The bun was bigger than the hotdog. It tasted like nothing, I enjoy a Nathan's or a Sabrett hotdog over this. It had no snap that a gourmet dog should have. I've had a Chicago Dog . New York dirty water dogs, famous papaya hot dogs and all were delicious!. I've eaten hot dogs from QT and they were better!. So needless to say I won't be going back.",

I got the Quarter Hounder (queso, bacon lettuce, tomato, special sauce) and a create your own (sauerkraut, queso, bacon, chili) with a side of homemade chips (with homemade ranch dipping sauce). I would get both again no question about it. The hot dogs casing had the perfect grilled snap when you bite into one and the buns are the perfect length so that you don't have any bites of just bread.  The staff was very helpful (and patient as it took us entirely too long to decide on our order as everything sounded good). They were very flexible with the coupon as well. They have a variety of seating areas to choose from.. Indoor AC area, some patio seating on the ground floor and a rooftop patio. After you place your order you take a number with you to your table and the food is brought out to you. Out food was brought out without minutes of sitting down and everything tastes warm and fresh!  Definitely will be back. It certainly does not hurt that there is a King of Pops cart in the parking lot to grab some dessert on your way out either..",

    "text": "I got to try out JJ's for my first time on a beautiful Saturday afternoon just right after the lunch rush (around 2:00ish). The parking lot is small but my friend and I were able to snag two spots that opened right as we pulled into the lot, likely due to the timing of our visit.   JJ's has two floors, upper patio and lower inside seating. The menu is chocked full of regional hot dog combos as well as options for personalizing your own. I ended up choosing the Whispering Pig (bacon makes everything better) with a side of onion rings and one of the local brews for my drink.  My friend chose the brew dog of the week, You Got Smoked, with a side of fries and the smoked amber beer.  By the time my friend ordered, JJ's ended up running out of the smoked amber beer so they gave her another drink on the house!  We grabbed our number and found a seat. This is where JJ's hit a snag. One of the employees dropped off my drink and then took our table number. Since this was our first time at JJ's, we weren't sure of how things were run. During the time that we proceeded to wait for our food to arrive, we learned that the employees are supposed to take the table number ONLY after delivering your food.  After watching a table whom we knew arrived after us did we stop the same employee who took our number and ask her what happened to our food. She then admitted her error and our food magically appeared. Unfortunately, it was no longer hot because it must have been sitting waiting for its rightful owners. The 'famous' JJ's onion rings I ordered ended up being cold. Cold onion rings are just a no-no. My friend's fries weren't that much warmer. We didn't want to send the food back because we were hungry. Thankfully, the hot dogs were still pretty warm and ended up being very delicious.  Even though the error put a little bit of damper on our meal, I definitely plan on going back because the hot dogs were VERY good and there are other combos I want to try as well as get to have a different experience.",

As you can probably tell, I was pleasantly surprised!  I got the Quarter Hounder -- really flavorful, just a little messy to eat.  Their fries were delicious, and were even better with a scoop of chili on top.  They've got desserts from King of Pops -- a renowned local Charlotte popsicle place.  Niche meets niche.

What is a pickle bar?  They pickle carrots,  cucumbers, peppers, and a few other things, and you can just grab some.

The fry order was definitely big enough to split! The Sonoraran veggie dog was awesome! Salsa, beans, slaw, and some cream sauce. Honestly, couldnt even tell it was a veggie dog! Oh and that red bbq-like sauce in the container on the counter is super legit and awesome to dip fries into!  They have beer bottles and a few draft beers.

Being from buffalo, I automatically loved that they had our infamous salens hot dogs and were charcoal grilled! There were many different varieties of toppings to chose from but I just wanted the typical toppings nothing too crazy. We got fries to share as well. All the food was great and service was fast which was surprising as they were pretty busy. My only complaint is that they didn't have vinegar for French fries! It's my favorite and a popular thing to put on them and was disappointed! Everything else was great though. They even have a little side bar of toppings of pickled veggies that you can add yourself or on the side.",

I got chilli on the side because I'm really picky when it comes to chilli, but the chilli was just ok nothing special but it was good on the dog. I ordered the onion rings and they were battered in goodness. It was a nice crowd, no one on the patio or rooftop. The wait wasn't  long at all. BTW Tuesday= $2 signature dogs. The parking lot is really tight as well.",

Their secret sauce that you can add to anything is killer good too, use it instead of ketchup on your fries and you will not regret it.    Food: 3.75 stars- fantastic for the area but hard to compete with a True Detroit coney dog or True Chicago dog  Service: 5 star the cashier noticed my deer in the headlights look for my first time being here and was more then willing to help me out! Overall, a good experience and I will probably repeat again especially for the price.",

That being said...I still wouldn't spend $2 on their hot dogs! My dog was completely burnt and the bun was way too small for it. I'm still very confused why it was completely black. Literally tasted like charcoal. Is that what charbroil is? Also, the wait was extremely long and nobody else was in front of us. The staff was trying to clean the whole restaurant at 8:30 so they could get out by 9:00, but if you stay open till 9:00 you should wait until your customers leave before closing. When we walked in at 8:30 they already had the chairs up and were pretty much pushing customers out the door with their \"I just want to get out of here\" attitudes. However, I think what upsets me most and probably what makes me the most bitter is that this East Boulevard location is PRIME and such a waste going to an overpriced hot dog place. They have an awesome roof top patio that I could have sat at for hours but then I remembered I was at a hot dog restaurant and that they were closing at 9...what a waste of a good location. Hope they go out of business so we can get a cool roof top bar on the block that stays open late.",

Being the dedicated Yelper that I am, had to try the Yelp dog before it was gone. I'll eat a hotdog if I am at a cook out and that's my only option, but its not a food I ever order or buy at the grocery store. JJ's might change that.   First off, it's very nice inside. Not divey at all. Their menu is large with hotdogs, sausages, chicken sandwiches and even some healthy stuff.   I opted for the Yelp dog. Pretzel bun, beer cheese, mustard and saurkraut. Mmm. I hope they put on the menu because I would come back for that. The house made chips are awesome. Can we take a moment to highlight their ranch? It's very heavy on the dill and absolutely dillicious. I know, I'm sorry. Seriously though that ranch is so good. They also have a little bar with housemade pickles, jalepenos and sauces.   They have a great patio and upstairs area, wish we would have discovered this place over the summer.",

I grabbed drinks and some goodies from the homemade pickle bar.  They have wonderful pickled onions and other veggies.  After maybe 5 minutes of waiting our food was brought to the table.  I ordered the Kasemeister, a cheese stuffed sausage with pickled onions, sauerkraut, and horseradish mustard.  SO good!  My side was onion rings... which a lot of them were missing batter but they were still tasty.  My kiddos loved the food!  One got a pb&j slider (the shame!) and one got a skinless dog.

You'll find this place in it's own still standing building, and sometimes you'll see that King of Pops is in front as well.  Yummolicious!  Just be prepared to that this place has a small parking lot.  I couldn't tell you where else you can park cause I've always been lucky enough to get a parking spot.  When you walk in, you can just order and pay at the counter.  I seem to always get the same thing, the Chili Cheese Coney, and I NEVER regret ordering it.  I seriously need to venture out and try all the other items on the menu, but my husband does that so I just steal bits of his order cause...marriage.  Try ordering a side of their fries and add the chili and cheese.  Yum yum.  When I order just one dog and a side, I always feel full as it hits the stomach just right.  They have dining inside where there are booths, and high tops.  There is also outside dining right near the door, and also on the rooftop!  If it's nice out, I suggest to sit outside on the rooftop as it's a nice view, and I like watching the traffic go bye while eating.  All in all, definitely check this place out.  Heck, it's also been visit by Guy Fieri and featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives if that tells you anything.",

That's his prerogative.  Now it's my prerogative to never visit JJ's again, not only for the items mentioned in my review, but for his unprofessionalism as a business owner.    He feels that I should reward his workers going above and beyond their regular duty.  To me, that's just called doing a great job.  I, too, go -- and have gone -- above and beyond in all of my jobs -- retail, restaurants, offices.  It's who I am.  I don't expect a tip for treating someone extra special or making their day.  Just doing it is reward enough.  Plus, I'm already being paid to provide good service by my employer(s).  That's why I was hired.  Jonathan also wanted to \"explain\" to me the difference between \"fast food\" and \"fast casual,\" since I apparently didn't get it.  Oh, I get it.  He suggests that they not only prepare my food and ring me up, they deliver it to my table.  Wow.  Well, that deserves an extra special bonus, right?  Meanwhile, I have to select the least dirtiest table in the dining room because nobody's out there cleaning them off.  Nobody checks up on me at my table afterwards.  Nobody refills my drink.  Nobody takes my trash away for me.  I left a 20% gratuity on the bill I signed at the register.  Where was the \"exceptional service\" and employees going \"above and beyond\" for that?    So, no thanks, Jonathan.  I'm not going to pay extra so your employees can treat me like a customer.  Just visiting your establishment should grant me that.",

The menu is a good size & easy to read. * They have Private Parking which makes it convenient. *Their place isn't too big, just enough space for everyone to feel relaxed. * It is very colorful inside with the music not being too loud.

Not worth the boooooginess of it all and the parking is miserable. Will not be coming back.",

Now I know a trip with JJ's as a destination is worth the journey! I was amazed at all of the choices other than hot dogs.  Options included sandwiches and salads as well as some vegan dishes. A wide selection of beer was available also. Back to the hot dogs though I ordered the very popular Char dog with chili onions and slaw period for my side I had the incredible onion rings thinly sliced and crusty. The atmosphere was friendly and the staff was welcoming. We ordered at the counter and our food was brought to us within minutes. I definitely plan to go back on one of their Tuesday afternoons after 3:00 when they serve $2 hot dogs and $2 beer. What a great deal for a week night after work!",

    "text": "Now let me first say hot dogs really aren't my thing, or more so weren't my thing. JJ's however has changed my view on hot dogs forever! This place is amazing! I stumbled upon it in the Dilworth area about a year ago. I gave it a try because of its retro theme and cute rooftop patio. I didn't realize they were famous for their dogs.   The first dog I tried was the dirty jerz (relish, onion, mustard, sauerkraut). It had the perfect amount of toppings to dog ratio. Also the hot dogs fit the buns perfectly so you're not stuck with extra bread.  My husband got the quarter hounder (queso, bacon, lettuce, tomato and special sauce). OMG! That dog changed my life. I wanted more!!!!!   Since our first visit my husband and I have made it a tradition to go on a walk with our dog to freedom park followed by lunch or dinner at JJ's every week. It's a family tradition I hope to keep.   I have also had the veggie dog, which was very good! You can't really even taste the difference! If you're a meat eater I dare you to try the veggie dog once.   My all time favorite dog has been a seasonal dog that features pimento and fried jalapenos!! It's <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! The only dog I didn't really care for was the southwestern dog, but only because the beans were over powering.   Besides the food, the staff has always been friendly and the owner even personally thanked us for coming in. It's always been clean and we never had a bad experience and we have been there 10+ times. I don't think enough people in Charlotte give this place a try or enough credit- but they NEED to!!!  We love JJ's!!!!",

It was such a beautiful day on Saturday I decided to take my dog for a walk through nearby Freedom Park and walk up from the park to grab some lunch. I'm glad we finally decided to try this place!   My wife got the Dirty Jerz (pickled relish, onions, mustard, & sauerkraut) combo with a side salad. Hers was good (more of a traditional\" hot dog to me), and the balsamic dressing was good! I opted for the Quarter Hounder (queso, bacon, lettuce, secret sauce) with the onion rings. My dog was phenomenal, the sauce/queso had a fantastic taste... The onion rings were okay, but nothing I would call \"infamous\" like they claim. Next time I'll probably opt for the cheese fries.   Besides the awesome food, probably my favorite things are the cheap prices ($6.99 for any dog, side and drink) and their awesome rooftop seating. We were able to lounge up there with our little pooch and soak up the sun while we chowed down. Definitely a must stop during a jaunt down East Blvd.",

And not just your typical boiled or grilled hot dogs, but hot dogs all dressed up and ready for the big dance. In this regard, JJ's doesn't disappoint.   I opt for the Chili Cheese Coney - chili, cheddar cheese, and onions - and the Whistle Pig - bacon, cheddar, onions, mustard. All this with a grilled Sahlen's frank, and you can't go wrong. I can't go wrong. If you don't want one of their signature dogs, no problem, you can build your own. Any topping, go for it!  Great atmosphere, too, tastefully and eclectically decorated. Not only do I enjoy the dogs, I enjoy eating here.  There are plenty of good places to get a hot dog in the QC, but JJ's just might be the best, or at the very least, the most original.",

Those little strings of love will have you drooling for more, guaranteed! No JJ's visit is complete without the infamous Ogre sauce of course. This sauce paired with those onion rings are a match made in heaven! They sell it by the bottle. Buy some. You're welcome. They have a pickle bar too where they have a number of different pickled toppings. My absolute favorite are the spicy pickles I make sure to leave with a few of those for the road!

I have enjoyed the Char Heel which is a classic souther style dog and the Joiet Jake which is their Chicago Dog... AWESOME!!!  The onion rings are not too greasy, the buns are not soggy and the hot dogs themselves are perfectly prepared and tasty.  The beer list is good enough and the prices are overall a heck of a deal.

    "text": "JJ's is not exactly a haven for the vegetarian contingent, but they have made some great strides in creating a hot dog place that's veggie friendly. I've been coming here since before the grand opening, and have been pleased on every turn.  I appreciate that they tried on their menu at the beginning, saw what worked and what didn't, and made a few changes. I didn't mind the loss of fries, since the chips are really quite good. I was disappointed at first to find they didn't have a vegetarian \"dog\" on the menu, but upon hearing that they weren't pleased with any mainstream offerings and hadn't created one in-house that they would be stoked to serve, I could handle the wait. When they finally created the \"veJJie,\" I tried it and am hooked. It's sauteed portobello, onion and peppers on a toasted bun with their KILLER aioli (or whatever they call it). It's a delicious combination and I am SO glad they didn't settle for a flaky, sub-par, tofu-esque creation.  As for the meaty offerings, all I hear are good things from the Mr. about the new sausage creations -- namely the Merguez, debuted at Sausagefest (an event I attended purely for the unlimited craft beer sampling). The Char Heel, JJ's #1 and Chicago are also big hits according to my sources.  There are other menu selections I enjoy trying from time to time...the onion rings are a worthy choice, salads are good (i loved the seasonal one with goat cheese from the summer), beer selection is better than you'd expect for a quick-casual place, and the orangeade and lemonades are totally refreshing and delicious. A perfect complement to the heavier entree items.  Oh, and the other day they had a butternut squash soup that was perfectly executed. Thanks!!  I love the rooftop seating, and their effort to create a fun, casual environment through having live music acts nearly every weekend. Also impressive is the fact that they make everything except the Sahlen's dogs IN HOUSE. And everything possible is NC sourced. For a semi-locavore like myself, that is definitely noteworthy. I think JJ's has some staying power in the community and look forward to their continued presence.  All in all, this isn't a prime spot for vegetarians, but it's a worthy lunch spot or quick dinner locale, especially if you're hitched to a hot dog or sausage lover (or have a pile of hungry kids to feed).  **Make sure when ordering that you are EXTRA specific with any alterations to the prescribed dog condiments, etc. Occasionally orders come out just shy of what you order...but that's generally supplemented by stellar customer service on the redo.",

JJ's is a great spot, home to a wide variety of signature dogs, from the Sonoran, with its delicious borracho beans, to the Chicago-style Joliet Jake, to my favorite little slice of hot dog hominess, the Dirty Jerz. Your dog will always have a crisp skin and taste like actual meat, just as it should be. Even next to the delicious hot dogs the sides do not disappoint. Try the sweet potato chips. You'll be hooked. I promise. The house made chips are excellent too and if your dog choice was not so south of the border, don't worry you can get a side of those tasty beans as well.  Top it all off with some selections from their pickle bar.  Now you can have a soda to go with your meal, but you can also have one of the craft beers they have, both on tap and in cans. They always have the local breweries well represented and $3 brew night sweetens the deal even more. If you aren't really in the beer know, the counter staff aren't usually very well versed, but even if you take a wild guess they have enough quality choices that you should be pleased.",

The onion rings and the house cut fries were both fantastic, but add the chili and cheese to the fries for perfection. I'll have to go back soon because I need to try every item on the menu. And do not skip the pickle bar. Great job Jon!!",

    "text": "JJ's is not a restaurant.  It's not a hot dog joint.  It's a culinary experience - designed to tickle your taste buds, and key into your other senses in pretty surprising ways.    Before even getting into the food, it's worth mentioning that everything about the restaurant is well-designed, and gorgeous.  The menus are creative and fun, interior decoration is clever and well-themed, and the layout of the restaurant is stellar -- especially if the weather is nice and you can sit on the rooftop deck!  I LOVE the hot dogs at JJ's.  Truly.  I've had several different combinations of hot dog type and toppings, including some of their crazy dog-of-the-days (The Elvis, for example, had peanut butter, honey, and banana chips on it!).  They're well made, and delicious.  even when there's a line to order, food never takes long.  I will admit that the one thing that's lacking for me is the sides - I've had the beans, fries, onion rings, and chips, and they're all relatively forgettable.  I usually stick to 2 dogs and a drink.    My favorite hot dog? Rocket sauce, bacon bits, and cole slaw.  Yum.  Keep an eye on JJ's instagram account for specials and contests, too.",

    "text": "A good hot dog? yes.  Five stars good? No way.   I have driven by plenty of times and thought about stopping but I have to be in a certain mood to have hot dogs, so when my daughter wanted to take me out for Father's day, I decided it was time to check out JJ's.  We arrived at 11:30 and I was surprised to find that we were the only people in the place. Usually not a good sign, but I had read so many glowing reviews we assumed that the rush would catch up with us later.  There was plenty of help behind the counter and they were eager to take our order. I had the Char dog with mustard, chili and slaw, my daughter had the Fryder man which had cheese, chili and french fries on the dog. We both had fries and we got an order of onion rings to share. I'll list the highs and lows:  Service was very good and the gang behind the counter was attentive but the kitchen was a little slow since we were the only ones there. Not too bad if you consider they make everything from scratch but keep it in mind if you plan to run in for a quick lunch and are on a schedule.  The star of the show is their hot dogs and their wieners were very good.  Nice char, mildly seasoned and clean tasting.  Natural casing made for a nice bite.  They are so mild that the flavor of the wiener is lost with most of the toppings.  Chili was good and reminded me of my Mom's homemade recipe.  The buns taste like a potato bun and they are nicely toasted but nothing special.  French fries are just OK.  could be frozen, i don't know. They are cooked well but nothing special.  Mine were a little greasy.  The onion rings were a big disappointment.  The first order was cold.  I mean like they had been in the refrigerator cold. They cooked us another order but by that time we were halfway through our dogs.  They were very greasy and not all that good anyway.  We got a couple dogs to go and i like the to-go containers.  Kept them safe and sound all the way home.  Bottom line is they make a good hot dog, everything else seems to suffer.  If I go back I will try the sausages, they had a pretty good selection.  If you are into crazy topping combinations and locally brewed beer on the roof, then this is probably your place.",

Their chili is good on a dog, but not great on its own. Balsamic salad dressing was very blah. Both the Italian sausage and Andouille sandwiches are good. Their onion rings are the skinny shoestring kind.",

We can both order the single dog combo with a drink for less than $15- what a deal!  I usually order the Whistle Pig- house-cured bacon (very good!) and lots of shredded cheddar cheese. Yum!  The pototo rolls that the dogs are served on are very soft and are served warm.  Try the Weiner the Pooh dog- peanut butter, honey and bacon.  Trust me, its good!  The sweet tea is awesome but give the OrangeAde a shot, very refreshing!",

The space and design details are great and the concept (once the crowds die down a little and some opening kinks are worked out) is perfect for a very fast, very cheap meal. They have 4 taps of local beers, and then a very decent canned beer list (Oskar Blues and the like).   My only complaint concerns the VERY young (most looked 18 or under), VERY inexperienced front of the house staff. It matters little since its a take-a-number type of place, but the girl taking our order was dumb as a box of rocks and had zero social tact.  Me: \"...and a side of fries please.\" Her: flatly \"We don't have those anymore.\" Me: *looks back at the menu* \"....Wasn't your grand opening yesterday? Do you mean you just ran out?\" Her: \"Ummmm...*stares vacantly* we just like, don't have them.\" -long pause- Me: \"Onion rings then.\"  I just thought it was funny.

They have a bit of whimsey in naming their hotdogs to match specific U S states. The restaurant is exceptionally clean with a health rating of 101.  Plus, the design of the restaurant is quite comfortable and pays homage to The Drum restaurant that occupied the space many years ago.  We look forward to returning to JJ's and trying their other hot dogs.",

We both had the Chili Cheese Coney and the dog itself has a lot more flavor than the typical dog. They grill it right there and the chili and cheese are very well balanced. The onion rings are terrific. I only wish they had healthy side options like a salad or a cup of fruit.",

They're not huge, but they're quality so that's what counts.  (They do serve the same brand next door at Lebowski's) They have the obligatory selection of pre-designed topping dogs, and sausages, as well as some other munchies like chips and salads, but we didn't try any of those.  You can also build your own dogs too if you want.  They also have an all you can eat hot dog buffet sometimes, and it was only $5 so if you can hit that up, it's a crazy deal. I think I had 6 the last time we went, so you can get your money's worth!  All in all, a cool vibe, if a little pricey, but I think it's worth it.",

    "text": "We stopped by JJ's later in the afternoon on their opening day, which was July 4th.  We were happy to see that the line had died down, because when we passed by the place about an hour earlier, there was a line wrapped around the building.  When we got inside, there was still a line to the ordering counter, but it moved pretty quick.  We were meeting several friends here so a couple of us got in line to order while others got a few tables together for our large group.  I had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and deli mustard, which was awesome, and the wife got the herb chicken sausage added to her salad.  Yeah you heard me right, she got a salad.  She enjoyed her mixed green chopped salad and the balsamic vinaigrette, and the chicken sausage made in-house was awesome.  We also ordered a couple of beer from their four taps.  On tap beers were local NoDa Brewing, OMB and a Foothills IPA. They also serve several beers from cans and red/white wine by the glass.  We also tried some of the dogs and I would need to return to eventually try them all.  Looking forward to getting a whistle pig next time.  The main issue with JJ's, when we were there, was the chaos that was their opening day.  Once the staff has a few shifts under their belts and they work the kinks out, I hope JJ's will be around for a long time.  They offer a very reasonably priced menu for Dilworth and what I assume will continue to be a stellar beer selection.  They also need to figure out a better way to order another beer other than going back up to the counter, especially, if they are planning on having groups of people hanging out at the restaurant.",

They were sitting on the counter and I was told they had forgotten about them and apologized.  I took the beers and went back on the roof.  In a few minutes two delicious hotdogs and fries arrived, I aske for a napkin ans the server directed me to downstairs, so I went and got napkins.  We ate the hot dogs and half way thru ran out of beer, no server in sight, and I had laready closed out my cc, so we finished our hot dogs and fries, and left heading somewhere else for a beer and an appetizer.

I know it's just a hot dog joint so I guess I shouldn't set the bar too high, but at the end of the day, the dogs weren't good enough to justify the price - which wasn't expensive. It's just hard to get around the idea that I could grill a dozen dogs on my back patio for the same price that would be twice as good. Long story short, wanted to like this place but I wasn't convinced. Might try it one more time once they've been open longer.",

For some reason my girlfriend has me craving hot dogs on a regular basis now and I have to say I have found the Charlotte, NC Madison Square Garden when it comes to dogs. Today I indulged in The Whistle Pig, all I can say is the 23 minutes and 19 seconds riding in the car to get here was well worth the 3 minutes it took me to eat the dog (I devour food). The dog is bigger than some sandwiches I have seen. It had the \"snap\" every dog should have on the first bite and it was also soooo flavorful. I mean I can actually taste the hot dog with all the toppings I had. The ambiance of JJ's Red Hots is awesome. The dining room is nice and open with tons of natural light. Its very inviting. Even though I was unable to make it to the roof it looked spectacular and comfortable.  I will most definitely be back to have a beer and a dog chillin' on top of the roof. If your in Charlotte you must stop by JJ's Red Hots",
