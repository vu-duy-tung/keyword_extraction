    "text": "Ok folks, having lived in Texas for a few yrs, I did have the pleasure of having a vast array of ethnic foods available at any hour. Esp Dallas. They had a Fuzzys Taco restaurant as well. And, ya never know until you try them, ..rt?!  They were, eh, so so. Nothing like what you'd find on the streets in Deep Ellum! So my bestie and I thought we'd give the new Fuzzys at Sycamore Commons a try. Ill cut to the chase here in case your reading this in hast, before running out the door to try them. Read on before you start the car dear, First sign of a questionable establishment, a lot of empty tables. Yup. But it was still early, ok, we'll continue. service was, quick, waiter was cute,... the food..... The Order incorrect, sent it back very nicely, waiter still cute food still wrong. I got my Baja shrimp looking gud!!  Tasting like last week's fresh shrimp. So freaking dissapointed, then I tried my fish taco. OMGosh. It looks like hamburger. OMGosh, it was hamburger. At this point, not worth sending back. But I did get my 2.99 back.  Thanks Fuzzys, but, you just didn't cut tha ethinaticity of Mexican food.",

The portions are small and the amount of protein (meat) in any dish even smaller.  Flavor is unremarkable.   A word of advise if you try it too:  1. Check your silverware closely.  On both visits we found numerous pieces of cutlery with food residue caked on.  Not 2 or 3 dirty items but more like 10.  One spoon was totally encrusted with refried beans.  We mentioned this to staff and they were very apologetic but we saw no one actually address the issue. 2.  Familiarize yourself with the item descriptions.  A management type person served our entrees and failed to include the tortillas and salsa that are part of the meal. It took me a moment to realize this and I went back and read the menu board to see if I was mistaken about what my order included.  I was not.  I can see a new server overlooking this but management ought to be more familiar.",

At least they didn't call it a \"joint\". There are several Mexican restaurants around that are so much better - La Unica, Three Amigo's, Cantina 1511, and NOBODY serves better fish tacos than Cabo.

Good that they repeat your order back to you. The whole bar thing needs some tweaking. You get a table number and they ask you stand at bar to wait for beverages. It was Cinco de Mayo, so the craziness may be gone on a regular Saturday?  Some of the runners seemed less than helpful, being it was our first time here like so many others we overheard, we had a few questions . Our queso was served lukewarm -timing needs improvement.  Again, could have been frantic due to Cinco de Mayo. Only day 3, so will return and may update rating. Food portions are good, especially the kids meals. All under $6 and includes a drink. Although  not authentic, it is good for the price against traditional Mexican spots,  which only seem to keep rising astronomically for their products.",

Not bad, the tempura fish was Meh, the tempura shrimp was the most flavorful.  Strawberry frozen lemonade was refreshing if a bit overly sweet. The Meh to bad was the Churro experience. We bought an order of each, Oreo and Cinnamon & Sugar. The initial taste was normal, but there was a very  strange and unpleasant lingering after-taste. 10 minutes later and the aftertaste is still noticeable in the back of throat/tonsil area. Called the store and management was very apologetic and quick to offer gratis replacement on our next visit. After inquiring, management stated that the Churros are fried in a different fryer than the seafood. Not sure if we will be back for a second try. The Breakfast all day menu looks very tempting.",

Fresh ingredients or even just a wedge of lime for some acid.   The Latin Potatoes were home fries and nothing more.  Nothing Latin at all about them. The Black Beans has some pico added, but still tasted like they were fresh from a can.  It's a bar that serves Mexican food, nothing special.  They do have good house brand hot sauces.",

I'll give them this the menu is more extensive than a Chipotle or Qdoba and they seem to have daily specials as the young lady who took my order did recommend the half priced nachos. I decided to order 2 types of tacos (Ground beef, Pork). I'm not a fan of what Sabor calls \"Americano Style\" tacos (ie. cheese, lettuce, tomato etc) so I get them with cilantro and onion as God intended. First thing I notice is these things seemed kid size no more than 2 bites each. They weren't even especially warm considered I ordered and waited there for them to be ready (came out quick, maybe should've taken a min to heat them up).Only now reading a review of someone's kid chowed down on more than 2 or 3 to get full, my mistake I guess. But the tacos were blah at best. Nothing I'll be returning for, especially in Charlotte's crowded Mexican cuisine market. Maybe if I lived directly next door and even than I think I saw a Qdoba nearby I'd hit up first. If your in the Matthews area, El Valle in downtown Matthews is close by with far better & more authentic taste.",

    "text": "Tacos are super greesy and I ordered a veggie one. It was dripping in oil.  Also I am sensitive to dairy and asked for no cheese. Eventhough my recipe reflected my request, it was as if no one actually looked at it.  My taco was covered in cheese.   Accidents happen so I had no issues with the mistake it was how their error was handled that was unacceptable.   They acted like I inconvenienced them by asking for a taco made the way I ordered.  The cashier literly took the taco and walked away without even telling me what they were doing.  I stood there and waited then finally asked what was going on and was informed the manager was handling it.  The manager just handed me a refunded receipt.  No apology,  nothing for their error.  Needless to say, my family will not be returning.  Food wasn't good enough to have poor service top it off.",

My cilantro was black in spots, the chicken was old and dry and the potatoes (I added to sub rice and beans) were cold. Total waste of money and would never recommend.",

Granted, it IS a new restaurant so they are working out the kinks, but the staff is very friendly, the food is always delicious and if by chance something isn't up to par with your food or a mistake is made a correction is made immediately by either whipping up a new meal on the house OR even giving us a gift card for the mistakes made.  The management staff here always goes above and beyond to make sure everyone has everything they need and they're very friendly. The atmosphere here is very uplifting and I will FOR SURE recommend all of my friends and family to come enjoy the delicious taco plates as well as the tasty margaritas. ;)",

The atmosphere is big and open, so perfect for groups in large parties and meet ups. Every one orders at the front and they bring it to your table.

Beer for a 18 ounce is only 4.99 which is pretty good price for a good size beer. Can't wait for this place to open in Berewick so I can go drink some good cheap drinks.

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. My family and I stopped in for lunch yesterday. The restaurant has a cool look and feel to it. You go to a counter to order like you would a fast food restaurant. The menu looked nice and there was a lot of variety to choose from. My daughter chose a quesadilla on the kids menu and they were nice enough to make a chicken and cheese quesadilla for her rather than the cheeseburger quesadilla on the menu. We picked baby carrots and ranch dressing as her side. My son ordered a chicken burrito. My husband and I each ordered a fajita steak bowl. It was $30. I go to insert my credit card and immediately a screen pops up for me to tip 10%, 15% or 20%. I chose %15, assuming I'd get service other than them dropping food off at our table. I had to fix my own drinks at the soda fountain and seat myself.  Food came out shortly after. I was underwhelmed at the quantity of the bowl. Looked about the size of a lean cuisine. Needed sour cream and the fajita steak was over cooked and not tender. Tasted good other than the steak being over cooked. My daughter said, \"mom, look at my carrots.\" There were 2. Two baby carrots. Seriously? And a whole ramekin filled up with ranch dressing for for her 2 baby carrots. I asked the food dropper offer and she said yes that was normal. Sheesh. The burrito my son ordered was fine. It appeared that it was encouraged for you to clear your own table with the trash cans and my husband began to gather and throw everything away. But I figured if I was tipping, I wasn't cleaning my own table so I left my stuff.   I'm still amazed at the two baby carrots as a side.",

    "text": "Fuzzy's Taco Shop is a clean, fast service Restaurant.  That being said I found out about this place for hotel staff.  I was expecting to be blown away.  But it's a typical taco place nothing special about the food.  I order a nacho chicken plate and Queso cheese dip.  When you first go in you go to the register to place your order.  I got a large drink and was told each refill was a dollar which is odd if that's were your making your money then something is wrong to begin with.  Second payed with a credit card and as soon as I swiped the card asked for a tip to be added.  For what is my question I do not know if the food is going to be good or the service is spot on.  I did tip 20% for what I do not know.  The food was brought out fast but that was the last I saw of anyone no one came by to ask if it was good bad or anything.  Food bland at best.  Queso tasted straight out of the can.    Chicken had no taste no seasoning at all.  The beans where luke warm at best.  The staff was cleaning and one girl was talking to others you couldn't help hearing her anywhere you were in the account.  I wanted her to just be quite for a min.  If you want to talk find out how the customers like there food and service.  The rest seemed to be keeping busy.    So if you want ok food little taste.  Service that's fast (one and done).  This is your place. But for $17.00 I will not be back.  Taco Bell here I come!!!  Same taste same food even faster service.",

    "text": "Had high hopes for this being a good fast taco place, but unfortunately the 3 of us all left disappointed and hungry.  The highs of this place we noticed were the menu was large, prices to portion were good, and friendly staff. Unfortunately those couldn't make up for some of the worst Mexican food we have ever had!  I ordered the fajita beef tacos which tasted bland and had a weird cream sauce on it, the shredded chicken tacos also had a weird sweet flavor. It was so unappealing I only ate half, as for sides  I got refried beans which were worse than a can of el paso from the store. The potatoes were mushy. The chicken salad was full of fatty chicken pieces that should have been trimmed and thrown away. My wife could only eat three bites before being grossed out from it, even my 7 year old said her chicken sticks were awful. We noticed a very bitter after taste with the chicken and her churros, guessing they have burnt fryer oil. The queso was off too, with this weird seasoning on the chips that was salty, but tasted similar to old bay seasoning. All in all, I would avoid this chain if you want good tacos. It's in a huge place which I am guessing will be something else soon bc their is no way they will be profitable.",

    "text": "Sadly I wanted to like this more than I did. Fuzzy's takes up a giant space, probably about twice as much as needed. You order at a counter, then go get your drink and take your number back to your table. They bring the food to you.   Then, if you're like me, you ask what about silverware, and they tell you it's by the beverages, so you have to go back and get it to start eating.   The food is ok, but not at all memorable. Selection is good. I ordered the taco plate with a shrimp on corn and chicken fajita on flour tortilla. I wasn't told until after I ordered (and asked), that my taco selections were an upcharge \"of $0.50 or $1 or something.\" They were $1 extra each...which is odd since a la carte they are $0.50 extra each.   When the food came out, I received two shrimp tacos on corn tortillas.  The food needed seasoning, and the hot sauce was not very hot.   Next time if I'm in the mood for tacos, I'd probably do El Valle or Qdoba (if I'm hungry) for better quality and price.",

    "text": "Fuzzy's knows what it is and is successful in what it does. Relatively inexpensive Tex-Mex in a fun environment. I had the combination plate with a brisket taco, beef enchilada, mex-tex rice and charro beans. The taco was the best followed closely by the enchilada, rice and finally beans. The beans were a little bland but I corrected that with the hot sauces provided on each table. My wife had one fish and one shrimp taco. She enjoyed the fish but thought the shrimp taco was dry. I would suggest some sort of chipotle crema to improve the shrimp. The also have several kids menu options that are sure to please a picky eater. Ultimately my favorite part about Fuzzy's was the drink selection. There's something for everyone including mixed drinks, bottles and cans and my favorite, draft beer.  Some more minor criticisms include the fact that when you order chips and queso it doesn't come with salsa. This has to be asked for separately. Also, it would be nice if they started offering drink specials for different days of the week. Changing those small factors would easily increase my rating to 5 stars.",

    "text": "I was not impressed. I think it's challenging to mess up tacos, but the flavor from these tacos was lacking. I had the taco plate, which is two tacos of your choice, 2 sides, and a drink. Maybe the drink was separate, I'm not sure. I also got churros. Either way, the tacos tasted bland, and they were small. The sides I opted for were cilantro lime rice and fried potatoes of some sort. I've had some amazing cilantro lime rice before, and this was not it. This rice was void of flavor. The potatoes looked and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time. Gross. The churros were hard on each end and were also lacking in flavor. They tasted like cardboard with sugar on it. The portion size of the churros was great. Too bad they tasted like cardboard. I really wanted some delicious churros. This place has very tasty unsweetened mango tea. I won't be returning. I really wanted this place to be all I had heard it would be.   Update: the manager reached out to me regarding my review and experience. I tried Fuzzy Taco again, and this time, the manager's presence was strong within the restaurant. He was monitoring and checking everything to ensure the best experience for his guests. The food was so much better! I will eat there again after this second experience! Try this place...they've improved significantly in a short period of time. Bravo!",

    "text": "Waahhhh. I wanted to like Fuzzy's so much more than I did. I have plenty of friends from Texas who are real devotees of this place. After eating the food I'm not sure why. I'm guessing people love this place out of familiarity, not flavor.   The positives (and there are a lot): the interior is really great - bright, clean and plenty of space, the staff was really friendly and helpful, the drink cups are large, the food came out lightening quick and some of the food (the brisket and the lime rice were good).   The negatives:  ** The queso does not taste like it contains any actual queso. It doesn't even taste like it contains pseudo cheese like Velveeta. It tastes like melted plastic. You just cannot have a real Tex-Mex place without decent queso. I agree with a previous person who said that even McAllisters has better queso. Even Chipotle's queso is better and that is a hard thing to say!! **The chips were only okay. The Fuzzy dust stuff (Chile powder mix?) could have used more salt and of course they would have been better warm.  **Both of our menu items (cheese enchiladas and a quesadilla) had some sort of something mixed with the cheese (I guess) that we couldn't really identify. It was pretty okay in the quesadilla, it was not good in the enchilada.   I'd love to say that with a few tweaks this place would be really good, but seeing as how they are a franchise, I doubt they will be changing that queso any time soon. :(",

It gives off kind of a tex mex sports bar theme. Unfortunately the food doesn't meet the quality of the space.   When you come in you are wow'd by the atmosphere of the place. It wasn't busy at all and yet they had MORE people than necessary working but they didn't seem like they were doing anything. Which means that all those extra hands not doing anything are costing the owners money. They cashiers seem nice. I was there with some guys from our company and so I gave my order and that was about it.   We got our drinks, sat down, and 3-4 minutes later a chips and queso came out. Probably the most disgusting chips and queso I have ever had. Especially for a place that is supposed to be tex mex good queso needs to be a must. Literally tasted like it came straight out of a can. McAllister's has much better queso and they don't even do tex mex.   Then the food came out. I ordered the fajita chicken burrito bowl. The presentation literally looked like it was just slopped together. It felt like a burrito soup because when I dug underneath everything on top to find the chicken it was wet rice and beans. I am pretty sure there was a bad piece of meat in there because I bit into a piece of chicken and it was really chewy which isnt good.   The reason why I am giving two stars is because their was actually a girl that came up and checked on us and cleared our trays and asked if she could get us anything else. Unfortunately that is not going to keep this restaurant alive. Everyone at our table agreed we probably wont be returning because the food just was not good. We could go to Chipotle or Qdoba if we want average to below average tex mex.",

I was expecting something a little more authentic Mexican, something significantly different than Chuey's or Moe's or Chipotle.   Well, the verdict is that it was basically the same old same old.  It was an order at the counter place where you take the number to the table and wait for the food.  Whatever.  They DID have a bar with a lot of beer on draft and a lot of pre-made frozen margaritas spinning around in the machines.  The atmosphere was bright and lively, a bit like Chuey's.   My impression is that this would be a great place for a family with kids who are looking for a fun atmosphere and are not discriminating with their food.  I had a fajita chicken burrito bowl that was served in a disposable cardboard bowl.   There was nothing special going on in that bowl. The beans and rice were luke warm, as was the chicken.  The salsa on top was just so so.  If I were a teacher and had to give a grade, it would be a C.   Oh, this looks and feels just like a chain restaurant.  If you like chains and Tex Mex, this may be your place.  For me, not so much.",

Tasted like flavored water. She was rude too.  Then we got another bartender who was very good. Thank goodness! Food tasted good. We had tacos and burritos.  The food portions seem small compared to other local restaurants like Tiajuana Flats and Abuelo's. Minus one star for loudness. Minus two stars for first rude bartender and bad margaritas. Minus one star for small food portions.",

I ended up going to one grand opening and being in the top 20 (no free tacos). Then I ended up going to another and ended up being in the top 10! Free tacos for me and my babe.   We go almost every week. This location is our favorite. The staff remembers us and always comes to check on us when we dine in. Super hospitable! There is actually another location closer but we don't like it there and drive the extra 10mins out here. No matter what part of CLT we're in, we come to this location.   It doesn't get too busy and the food is always hot and fresh. Please come check them out. Their shrimp tempura tacos are superb with some hot sauce!!",

I was trying to be healthy, so I ordered the Big Bowl Salad with steak and fire roasted salsa for dressing.  When it arrived I was surprised the bowl was an adequate size (not sure I'd call it big), but the salad itself was small. The bowl was about half full.  I asked the person who handed me the food if this was correct, and she said the bowl used to be bigger but people complained the bowl made the salad look to small.  I told her it still seemed to be a problem.  The manager came by later to ask me about my food, and I asked her the same thing. She gave me the same answer.  She offered to bring me more lettuce.  I didn't want just more lettuce. I told her if they market it as a big bowl salad, the salad needed to be big and not just the bowl.  She said she'd tell corporate.    The salad itself was ok.  Fresh ingredients but nothing special. The steak tasted fine too.  The salsa was a little bit sweet and not very fire roasted.   I wish I'd taken a picture, but I see other pictures of their salads on here. Mine looked the same. Half full.  Disappointing.",

We ate here on Saturday, March 2nd at the request of a friend (whose birthday it was) whose kids wanted tacos.    My husband and I each ordered a two taco platter... His order was correct, mine was completely wrong.  They took mine back, and replaced it with the right order.  The tacos were barely flavored with anything at all.   They were flour tortillas, cold cheddar cheese, shredded iceburg lettuce, and a few shrimp.  The only sauces on offer were called 'butt burning', the bottles on our table were sticky, and the sauce smelled like turpentine... so I passed on sauce.  The black beans were cold.  I could go on, but why bother?  The 'full bar' consisted of several margarita machines.  All were frozen concoctions of syrup and liquor.  There was no option for anything on the rocks or made fresh.  I had a beer.  This place is cheap and has cheap food.  If you like flavorless food and your kids are so picky that this is the level of blandness required, great.  Otherwise, find another taco place!",

For a quick taco spot, I'd much rather go to Sabor.

Will give them another shot since it's so close to home & they have schooners!",

The menu was vast .  ----We ordered the burrito bowls at 8.95 , the two taco plate with refried beans , and potatoes , and the kids quesilldia with cinnamon churros . All had flavor and all was satisfying for my family of 4 , at only $32 . Not bad and 10times cheaper than chipotle. There was fresh cilantro and guac on our bowls .  There's an option of corn/ flour tortillas , or hard shell .  -Service , they are quick with food prep and they bring your meals out to you as well as clean the tables all with a cheerful attitude .   We will definitely visit again when we're craving  a simple , yet flavorful taco ...",

    "text": "Fuzzy's has replaced Amor de Brazil in Syacmore Commons, which means that they have a rather large space to fill - and that by many definitions they are perhaps not a \"shop\", but rather a full-blown \"restaurant'. This is perhaps being a bit particular, but as they just opened, it becomes important.   At least on their first night of business, they were seeing a brisk crowd - in fact, for most of the places in this strip, it would be a ton of business - but because of the sheer size of the location, it really wasn't full. Unfortunately, due to a lack of training, unclear registers or some other reason, just having a line two people long to order tacos took way longer than it should have.  The good news is that once you get through the ordering process itself, there were plenty of seats available, the rest of the staff was ready and waiting to help - lots of them wandering around and clearing off unused items and making sure that the visit was good, and once the food came up it didn't take long to deliver to the table (you are given one of those numbers that you stick on your table so they know where to send it once it is ready).  As to the food? It's reasonable enough, and you can come out full for a few dollars, probably less than you will spend at most Mexican restaurants, but there are other, more authentic places around if you look closely enough. Many of the tacos we tried - and we tried several of them - didn't have much flavor, and even add the \"Butt Burnin\" sauce didn't help a whole lot (and my butt wasn't burnin', either - so the advertising wasn't really telling the truth, either!).  Regardless, it was their first night, so here is to hoping that things improve.",

    "text": "When two chefs who both happen to be mystery shoppers go out to eat, what do you think happens???  We never really escape from that mode unless the place is really special.  There's a few special places in the downtown Matthews vicinity but this isn't really one of them.  I always go to some place new with an open mind and really don't let the fact that a specific business location has never really hosted any successful restaurant, how many restaurants have been in that spot??  Positive and fun atmosphere and wide open space.  I liked how clean it was, the cashier was very friendly and efficient, the table tops were slick and dry, like we were the first to ever sit there and the mango tea was exquisite!!!  Other people's Margaritas looked amazing!!  I felt that our two taco dishes were petit and small, each taco being about two man-bites.  My son needed two additional tacos for a total of four to be full. I could have eaten 5 however I shoved myself into my skinny jeans and just couldn't manage to eat more than two. Ugh!  I didn't like the Hot Sauce at all and after reading the second ingredient was KETCHUP, was disappointed (you have to bring your own hot sauce) to a taco restaurant, really???  The yellow rice was excellent and had good flavors but the white rice was under cooked and firm.  Nothing was served piping hot except the freshly fried potatoes which they forgot to put on our plates.  To rectify this, they brought us complementary Churros!!!  Yeah, so the best way to heat up these churros which come in already made, I buy them too) is in a hot dry oven and then they can be cut up and tossed into cinnamon sugar.  What y'all do - is cut them up and then deep fry those little sponges which suck up the grease (they're already cooked).  Then, they were tossed with cinnamon sugar which had a cayenne background flavor as if the two spices crossed paths inadvertently during some period of service.  As soon as we all bit into them, the fry grease was released like that chewing gum from the 80's called \"Freshen-UP\" The gum that squirts!!!  My wife's salad entree was also petit and served in a giant bowl which only made the portion appear smaller and seemed to be lacking in salad ingredients. The avocado ranch dressing however is quite yummy and we even took some home!!!  Maybe as a group of drunken friends going out for a casual bite it's okay but as an eatery to frequent, not so much.  \"Eat Me\" being part of their logo just made me keep thinking about vulgarities!!  After discussing this at home, we both felt the same way!!!  Inconsistency will be their downfall.",

    "text": "Landed here as Kabab Je was not open because of the weather (great middle eastern food!) I wish I stayed home. Service was fair, after they ran our food out to the wrong table. The single guy who got our food (two of us) didn't say anything. He ate my burrito even though he ordered something different.  When the staff noticed us sitting there without food they did rectify the situation and brought fresh orders to our table.  Food, less than par. Service the same. Managment did send out an order of chips and cheese, but we had already had the nachos. Good effort to rectify, but not sure we're heading back anytime soon.",

    "text": "We're frequent visitors of Fuzzy's which helps when you have one free taco plate a year! We love their frozen drinks with the mini Coronas and mini champagne bottles in them and usually order at least one with each visit. Their queso is good and comes with some tomatoes and cheese sprinkled on top with dusted chips. I usually get the taco plate and my favorite are the breakfast tacos with bacon or chorizo with the Latin fried potatoes on the side. We've also ordered the burrito before and I highly recommend getting it smothered so it comes covered in queso! Our food always comes out quickly and hot here, my only qualm is that we always sit at the bar (there's full service there) but the bartender is always different. They must go through staff quickly here because I think we've only had the same bartender twice which means there's always a learning curve with the new staff members.",

    "text": "Fuzzy's taco shop! My husband and I went there to have dinner, I had the taco plate, it was absolutely delicious. I ordered refried beans, but they brought regular black beans. I asked the lady if that was just regular black beans or refried beans and she said,  \"well it's regular black beans, did you order refried beans?\" And I said, \"I did but it's OK I'll try the black beans.\", and she was so apologetic she said \"oh no that's OK, are you sure?\" And I said, \"it's really OK, I am happy to try the black beans since I haven't been here before.\" And we got our food right away, we got a regular margarita and it was delicious, it was so good. The prices are amazing and the food is so delicious and so fresh; meanwhile the waitress came back and brought me a free refried bean dish to try because she felt bad. She was very apologetic and went above the norm.  It was so delicious and she was so nice everyone was so excited and happy to be working there and serving there.  I cannot wait to go back and I give them 6 stars.",

And then the girl who took our order was just as nice and very helpful. We all ordered and headed for a table. Our food was there in about 2 minutes. Great timing!  Now for the food. Finally, a restaurant not afraid to use some spice. Not too much, but really favorable. And the folks cleaning up were right there, clearing as we went. This was a great first experience.",
