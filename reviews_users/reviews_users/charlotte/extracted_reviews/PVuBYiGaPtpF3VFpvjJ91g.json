Typically, there is not much on this planet that excites me more than fresh, local, organic ingredients on a sandwich, but when I can have that and a salad bar I am a happy little tree-hugger.   Jason's is an all-time favorite sandwich place of mine and of my fellow vegan foodie. The portabello wrappini (hold the cheese, please) and the salad bar with their black currant tea are the keys to the good life for lunch and a mid-afternoon craving for a friggin' good sandwich. (And of course, the occasional slide on the vegan diet for a much needed fill of cheese that can only be satisfied by their french onion or tomato basil soup- yummo).   A few bummers-  the lack of veggie sandwich options ( I think there are only 3 or 4), which is why I pretty much order the same thing every time. But having this in mind, I haven't been displeased going there for my mushroom wrappini.   This is a good place to take anyone because they have stuff that everyone likes (even pasta for those who don't want a sandwich- in which case you should rush them to the nearest hospital because something ain't right- who goes to a damn deli and doesn't get a sandwich?).   cheers and happy sandwiching,  the vegan foodies  (written by Tara, the Karim in Karimaford- admittedly high strung half of the vegan.foodie.team )",

You order at the counter, pay at the end of the line, and take a number.  Within a few minutes your food is delivered to your table.  Consistent product.  Service and atmosphere are OK, but nothing special.  Nothing fancy, just a decent meal at a decent price.  It can get crowded at lunch, so you may have to wait for a few minutes to score a table, but with dining times probably averaging somewhere around 20-30 minutes and with so many tables, your wait won't be long.  I often get takeout salad bar - for around $8 you load up a giant plastic container with as much as you can.  They even give you a few extra containers to load up dressings, desserts, cornbread, etc.",

Thank god I my friend had been there before and directed me to the small cashier booth near the back of the place so we could place our orders. There's a pretty diverse choice of sandwiches, soups, and salads here. Also there's free soft serve ice cream. Who doesn't love free ice cream?!  Our orders came out fast, but I asked for no tomatoes and ended up picking them out of my sandwich. Also when I order a sandwich toasted I kind of expect the inside to not be cold. It kind of throws off the whole texture for me, you know? That being said their sandwiches are huge! It was almost too much meat stuffed into the slices of bread, because I had to take bites from each side so that it wouldn't slip out.  The ambiance I would describe as noisy, and corporate. That's not really an issue though when you are just grabbing a quick bite before heading to a party as I was doing, but for sitting down and enjoying the surroundings I'd recommend somewhere else.",

It's a decent place for lunch when you're in the middle of the work day. The service is pretty quick, and there's always the salad bar option if you're in a hurry. It's nicer than the other chain delis, so it's good to have on hand. I get into such ruts with lunch that I need help sometimes remembering that I can go to more than the three places I always go.",

It's a bummer that soup, bread, anything you want other than Saltines and \"organic crackers\" is extra, but hey, this isn't Sweet Tomatoes (GOD how I wish it was).

The first kind occurs about once a week, when everyone on the team goes, and we spend some time socializing in a real restaurant. The other kind also occurs about once a week and involves my walking out the door without my (fully packed, waiting in the fridge) lunch bag.  Jason's is a good spot for the latter type of lunch, but not the former.  The food is good and, depending on what you get, even fairly healthy.  I tend to stick to the \"lighter choice\" sandwiches, which include things like chicken salad and the Mediterranean wrap.  The salad bar is extensive and fresh.  The reason Jason's is not good for the more social kind of work lunch is that it's big, crowded, pretty atmosphere-less, and loud. Service is quick, but if you go at noon, be prepared to have many co-diners.",

They give you a big plastic salad container, plus two smaller round ones. I think you're supposed to put dressing in one of them... but why would you do that when you could put pudding in it instead?!  They have do it yourself kiosks where you can place your order and pay without actually having to interact with a human.

    "text": "The first time I was invited to Jason's Deli, I thought, \"Eh.  Okay.\"  I'm not a big fan of delis unless it's one in New York City that provides you with a mound (literally) of corned beef and cheese.    Jason's Deli was much more than I expected.  I wisely chose their salad bar.  For the price, their salad offerings are awesome.  There are items on their bar that you wouldn't find on most salad bars because they're pricier (kalamata olives, for example) than normal salad bar findings.   There are also items like hummus.  What a treat!   When you're finished with your meal, everyone's invited to a free swirled ice cream treat.  Bonus!  Especially on hot summer days.    Attention parents: Jason's is a fantastic place to bring your kids.  Kids' meals are extremely low for the entree, side, drink, and ice cream!   You can't go wrong with their incredible pricing.  And the fact that their items are healthier than McDonald's or Burger King makes it all the better.   As for everyone's comments on date night at Jason's Deli, why would you bring a date here?  It's a deli.  \"Hey, baby -- how about we split a muffaletta?\"  Were those dates followed up by a night trolling the street for quarters, too?  It's obviously not a date place, so Jason's shouldn't be judged by that.  It's a place to grab a great nutritious sandwich, soup, or salad at a great deal!",

    "text": "Their food and menu selection is pretty good; however, the reliability of their delivery is next to nothing. I have ordered delivery from them five times for a lunch meeting, and three of the five orders have been delayed or incorrect in one way or another. We actually stopped using them for our lunch meetings (because even if you placed an order at 9:30 or 10:00am, they could not guarantee a 12:00 delivery time), but today I figured I would give it another shot. Enough time had passed, surely they've worked out the kinks, right? Wrong...  I place the online order at 10:20 for lunch delivery at 12:00pm (I figure an hour and a half is enough notice to have 6 sandwiches prepared and delivered) - immediately following I get an email from the catering manager, Maggy, who tells me that they won't be able to prepare and deliver the food in time, but that it would be here between 12:30 and 12:45. No worries. I will give my team a heads up. So I step into my meeting and go about my day. At 12:20 (Mind you, a full TWO HOURS after I placed the order AND got a confirmation email from the catering manager that they had received the order and would have it delivered), they call and leave me a message saying that they do not make one of the sandwiches on the menu anymore and that they needed to know what we would like as a replacement. I get the message 10 minutes later when I step out of the meeting to check on the status of the delivery. So at 12:30 I found out that not only is our lunch not here, it's also not on the way because they need to know what we want as a replacement for the Johnny Cashew sandwich.  We've adjusted for the two hour delay, but it seems pretty ridiculous that not one single person (not even the manager who sent me the order email saying that she'd have our order delivered just a little bit later than requested) could bother to look at the order itself to confirm that they have the items in stock to make the menu items available - nor have they had them for a \"long time.\"   So if you have the time or freedom to visit the store itself, absolutely give it a shot. But if you need to cater a lunch meeting - go somewhere else if you want to make sure the correct order is there at the correct time. Completely unreliable.",

I find that the salad bar is well stocked with fresh ingredients to make a very tasty salad. They even have some organic options. I love artichokes, green peas, and a good hard boiled egg on my leafy greens! After lunch, reward yourself with a self-serve soft ice cream cone...I can't help myself.    The sandwiches and soups look pretty good, but depending on what you order it could leave you wanting (as my co-worker sat sad-eyed looking over at my abundant salad compared to his chicken salad wrap).  There is plenty of seating with booths or tables that you can easily push together to accommodate any size group. The employees work with a smile and stay busy cleaning, bussing, replenishing.   For the type of food place this is and all-you-can eat salad bar for under $10...I'm a fan.",

But there is something to see here!

We saw my three year old knocked to the floor by an unapologetic member of the over-busy wait staff. And we saw people slipping on the wet floor by the salad bar. We saw plenty over the long period of time. Just nothing good. Nor did we taste anything good.   I'd give this place a pass. Even in the world of generic deli franchises, this is quite poor.",

I stuff my to go box with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese, pasta salad, bean salad, boiled eggs, cottage cheese, croutons and more. I'm not ashamed to say I have a hard time closing it! One time a rude employee was absolutely horrified by how much I stuffed in the box and loudly told me it was way too much food. There's no shame in my game when it comes to getting multiple meals out of takeout. ;) It's well worth going just for the salad bar and I should go more often.   I got the turkey sandwich once with a side salad bar to go, and while it was still good, I prefer the full salad bar. I got the baked potato with cheese once and I was shocked at how large the portion was - it's definitely not a Wendy's baked potato!  Make sure to get some free ice cream before you leave! Yum, now I'm craving that salad bar.",

    "text": "As a Jason's Deli goes, this location was fine. The food was tasty, but my soup wasn't as hot as I would have liked. My veggie wrap was great. I had forgotten to order my sandwich with spicy mustard, but the staff was quick in scooping up a good portion so I could mend my error. One of my dining mates and I did splurge on ice cream and added chocolate sauce...yum! Was a little disappointed the machine did not want to provide the vanilla and chocolate swirl of flavors in the typical half and half pattern of soft serve machines, but perhaps it is now corrected. The chocolate sauce in the pump container made up for it.",

    "text": "Finally, went and dine at Jason's Deli last night after the movies. Perfect location across the street from Park Road Shopping Center. Everything is pretty much closed at 9:25 PM except for the movie theater.   Have been ordering and taking out from Jason's for business meeting as well as on the go.  Jason's deli is not like your typical deli. It's has a little bit of everything. Reminds me of a cafeteria growing up. They have a salad bar and with a good selection to choose from. They had miniature gingerbread muffin which was so good. Pop one and you are addicted to wanting more. Only, tried one.  The Lobster Chowder is out of this world. Got it in a cup which was savory and so rich/creamy. They should call it Lobster Bisque for sure. What kind of liquor did they put in? Sherry? You definitely need to try this out.   My regular is Hot Pastrami on Rye with Mustard. It was good and comes with a side of chips. We also ordered 1/2 a sandwich with salad and came with a side of chips too. Great place to bring the family for food is nice size portion to share with others.  Do not forget to get your free ice cream. Make your own. Soft ice cream with flavors or vanilla, chocolate or swirl-combo of both.  Nice and quite last night, there were other patrons at the deli at 9:25 PM.",

It's 690 calories, but feels like you are eating so much more.  Bacon, turkey, Guac, cheese, on a croissant is mouth watering.  You can get a half sandwich with salad bar or soup with chips or get the full sandwich with a side.  I have had the chips, veggies, and fruit cup with delicious fruit dip.    Did I mention they have free ice cream?!   The prices are right and the service is great at this location!    5 stars for price, quality, and variety.",

You would think that they would treat you with great customer service, but he put a bad face on the company with his attitude. I'll definitely be choosing another lunch place to eat at from here on out.  Customer service means everything and if a company doesn't have that they won't dare get any coins from me.",

I ordered the manager's special with a half salmon sandwich, veggie soup, and fruit, my go to meal here. If you are ravaged don't worry, I like to nibble on a little gingerbread muffin or pumpkin cracker while I wait. The food came out piping hot and looking great, the veggies and fruits were so fresh. Its the perfect sized meal complete with soup and fresh fruit. The half salmon sandwich with avocado spread was delicious and filling.   I like to treat myself to a mini sundae cone, drizzle with chocolate syrup and add almonds from the comp bar! Yum. I always leave here so stuffed. Great bang for your buck.   The staff was extra happy and friendly, love it.",

    "text": "Jason s Deli is one of my neighborhood favorites. The main reason I like them is due to their salad bar buffet. Sometimes I like to get back into healthy eating and do not want to prepare a healthy meal at home and for only $9 (incl. taxes) you can eat as much as you want from the salad bar. Besides the salad bar they offer great soups, sandwiches and desserts.  The other great benefit is that they offer free ice-cream for anyone who eats there.   The place is nice, clean, and modern. It has plenty of seating, booths and individual tables that can be place together in case a larger group would like to eat there. They also have a nice outdoor seating area located on the top patio overseeing the fountain. In the summertime it is certainly nice to eat indoors due to the heat, but we aware their AC is cranked up. Bring a hoodie/cardigan to cover yourself in case you are coming in a tank shirt.   The staff is always friendly and helpful. And the overall price range is super affordable. The salad bar is amazing. It includes quinoa, noodle salads, lettuce, eggs, all types of vegetables, fruits, crackers, dressings and even pudding and yogurt. This is truly unbeatable.  And last but certainly not least, Jason s Deli focuses on healthy options. A few things are organic, and the salad bar has quality vegetables, which you can taste.   I would highly recommend this place!!",

    "text": "This Jason's Deli is certainly my favorite one! Everyone is so so kind and generous here!   As with all Jason's Delis, the food is delicious!   I highly recommend the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich! It's a great taste combo. Definitely on the savory end of sandwiches! It's a great combo of flavors!   I also highly recommend the Hot Pastrami Sandwich. I find pastrami sandwiches to be salty often times but it's honestly perfect here. I'm weird and I enjoy the sandwich with croissant and provolone cheese though many people seem to opt for rye/ white/ wheat with Swiss! I prefer provolone for that subtle cheese taste though you may enjoy the sharp tang of the melted Swiss cheese!   I also enjoy the Royale Club. I do dock points cause it's not toasted and I'm a toasty sandwich type of person. Though the croissant is fantastic so not a huge loss! I do find this sandwich to have a bit too much meat for my taste. It overwhelms all the other flavors, including the honey mustard!! But the meat is still delicious so again, not a huge deal.   Make sure to get some pickles to complement your sandwiches. I also recommend the Kettle Cooked chips over the baked ones! The kettle cooked chips come with sea salt and they're yummy!   Lastly, don't skip out on the fruit dip!!! It's so so so good!!!! But then again, you may want to opt for the FREE ICE CREAM for dessert instead! There's always a lot of delicious options at Jason's Deli so you can't go wrong!",

    "text": "One of the better Jason's in the chain and I've been to roughly 50 of them! I'm not sure how people can complain about this place. This Jason's, and all of them in the chain, succeed at doing what most large chains can't: providing quality sandwiches, a solid salad bar and better than average soups, every time you come, and for a more than fair price.   Hands down, it's tough to find a comparable option that brings similar quality, portions and price, all in an upbeat, clean, friendly atmosphere. This is one of the few chains that has something for everyone, regardless of age or taste buds. The salad bar alone is worth coming for.   Like many patrons, I always go with the Manager's Special: awarding a half sandwich with either a side salad bar or cup of soup. This is more than enough food, but I normally switch out the baked chips for blue chips and salsa (there's an upcharge) or veggies. Meanwhile, for those with a large appetite there's plenty of sandwiches to fill you up, an array of bread options, loaded potatoes, pasta and much more.   If you can't find something that suits your needs here you can't find it anywhere.",
