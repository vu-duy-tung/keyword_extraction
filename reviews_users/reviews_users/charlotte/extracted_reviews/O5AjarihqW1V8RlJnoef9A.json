    "text": "I stopped at Matt's for a quick bite while attending a conference.  The location was perfect -- close to the convention center, yet not right in the middle of all of the hubub.  The park was pleasant to walk next to while heading over, but  I was glad to have someone with me who had been there before.  While ordering, the staff was polite and friendly, noting our convention badges and asking where we were from.  They recognized the members of our group that had been there the previous day.  I ordered the two corn-dog combo; others in my group ordered the hot dog combo and the burger combo.  The fries were piping hot and perfectly seasoned.  Our corn-dogs were the perfect combination of golden batter and awesome dog, and the burger and regular dogs were gone before I could ask the others how they were :)  The ketchup on the table was a little low, but I think we were there just after the lunch rush, so that was understandable.  By the time I was ready for a refill on my diet coke before heading out, there was a small line at the register.  The cashier waved me to the front of the line when he saw my cup, so I didn't have to wait while others ordered -- I was highly surprised, and very thankful for his consideration.  I wish more restaurants did that.  One of the earlier reviewers mentioned confusion with picking up baskets right next to the utensil area -- when I visited, there was a young woman running food out (she called the number and waited for the correct person to raise their hands).  It seemed to work much better than having customers pick up their order.    I would definitely recommend Matt's Chicago Dog for anyone in the area.",

The real Vienna beef dog... well, it was a bit soft but in general the food here to me says west 35th, 55th off the Dan Ryan, or even 95th and Ewing if you know what I mean. They've got the lingo. Fresh cut fries, pizza puffs.  Sadly the decor to me says something more like Fullerton and Clark. It's just a little too nice. I know that's a strange complaint. The tables and chairs look right, but that glass-and-brass sneezeguard and the tasteful mural... eh. Its just not tacky enough. I want to see posters of thick eyebrowed women holding up kronos gyros.  I digress. Tasteful decor is not a dealbreaker though. I'm sure I'll be back.",

Is Matt's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? No. Is Matt's the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty.   The Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries.   I definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future.",

If Matt would pony up for the bigger dog I'd give him Five Stars. Four Stars for the dog.  The fries were five stars though. Nice fresh cut wit skins still on and crispy as well.    It's more like Devil Dogs and not The Weiners Circle.  It is Charlotte and not Chicago so I might be a little hard on the place.   They do have Coke on Tap and Mexican Coke in the bottle.  Get the bigger dogs and you can get an extra star.   $7 for the small dog and fries plus drink is a bit on the high side as well.  Since its about a 15 minute walk from the hotel we stay at and no car it will see me for lunch again.",

Steamed or water-simmered, kosher-style, all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices, pickled sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt. NEVER, NEVER has ketchup. That's like putting ketchup on a Brat...absolute no, no :)   Matt's, also located in Cornelius is great for a quick pit stop. They also have burgers, salads, Italian beef, etc. You can get everything \"Carolina style\" too if you're so inclined. Located on The Green near Aquavina. Great outdoor seating on a nice day!",

Matt's is nice because it's located right on the green and only a few blocks from Trade and Tryon.    The good: Burgers, hot dogs, milk shakes, and hand dipped ice cream. One of the only places in uptown you'll find a corn dog. Great combos! Matt runs the register which it's nice to be reminded that there are still family run businesses doing well.   The bad: Fries are a little mushy and greasy for my taste.  There always seems to be a little bit of a confusion when you try and get your food from the counter. They'll call your number and you pick up your food with no problem, but they only have a small tiny area for straws, napkins and lids for your drinks, so if everyone else is trying to get those items it turns into bumper to bumper traffic and can become frustrating.",

I gave it a shot, but it ultimately was not my taste, so it was banished to the serving container....  The remainder of the hot dog was really good though.   The brat - Nothing to write home about.

Short walk from our meeting, and Matt's is located on the first floor of what appears to be a newer condominium building. The entrance is adjacent to an outside green space area with multiple other shops and eateries nearby.  Fantastic seating outside and ample table space inside.  He went for the BBQ pork and I chose the Italian beef with cheese and hot peppers ( vs sweet). Au jus on the side, a basil based sauce that perfectly complemented the hoagie. Ladies, you'll need the knife and fork provided. Don't attempt to handle this one without 'em.  Well done, Matt!",

The homemade chips with a side of ranch are amazing!  I have other friends that have tried other items and love them. This is a must have stop in our lunch rotation. On the healthier side, they have an apple blue cheese salad that is AWESOME. It has huge slices of apple, pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and romaine lettuce with a balsamic dressing.

I decided to give Matt's Chicago Dog a try because I've always noticed the crowds, I love hot dogs, and I love Chicago (I'm a sucker for marketing).    The menu was a lot more extensive than I was expecting and I felt a bit overwhelmed, like being the new kid coming into a school halfway through the year.  Everyone walking in knew what they wanted and how to order.  I, on the other hand, felt like I had to go back to Ordering Food 101.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and accommodating, though, and walked me through the process.  I still felt stupid, but at least I got to order.    Finding a place to sit was the biggest challenge.  The place fills up during lunch.  Luckily, hot dogs (and other similar items) are usually quick to eat, so people don't stay seated for very long.  The atmosphere doesn't pretend to be a place for \"hanging out\" and talking anyway, so you want to eat and go.    The people working there definitely have a good process, but you still have to wait a little while for your food, as everything's freshly made.  And with the menu and the list of toppings being so extensive, no two things coming out are probably alike.    I got my polish sausage and fries in good time, though, and enjoyed them immensely.  I just wish we had someplace like Matt's near MY workplace, as I'd like to try a lot more on the cheaply priced menu!",

The staff is SO helpful in making recommendations and making your order correctly. It's a fast service with a \"fast food\" feel, but the staff is involved and conversational. Towards the end of our meal, the owner came around and asked us what we thought. We told him we loved it, and we weren't lying!",

    "text": "i've been here a few times. I called my order in #5 (Cheesburger combo w/ fries). Once I walked in I stood in line waiting (while CHECKING IN to Yelp) to get to the counter to pick my order up.   Once the line dwindled down, i said i was here to pick up an order, She said my name (made me wonder if i was the only person to call a order in... DURING LUNCH).   Ok, you ordered a MUSHROOM SWISS BURGER (photo taken) w/ chips. Ummmm, NOoooo!! I ordered a number 5. Cheesebuger Combo w/ Fries & Drink  after a brief embarrasing moment. I was offered a \"Mushroom Swiss Burger\". Well I didn't order it 1st of all, But I LOVE FOOD, and havn't tried it before. So i say, \"sure\" why not (i didn't want them to throw it away either...no one wins in that case). So i asked for Fries (as originally ordered). I was given Fries and i was able to keep the CHIPS. (cool, i've never had them b4 either) chips are pretty good.  So, I get back to the office ready to tear into this burger. So... my first bite was filled with Mushrooms. Made me think, \"whoever ORDERED this must REALLLLY REALLLY REALLY LIKE MUSHROOMS... it was loaded w/ them and onions. bacon, & swiss.   Notta bad burger at all. I would probably get it again and ask for LIGHT MUSHROOMS.   *** also, once i got to the counter the young lady told me in a motherly fashion... THE NEXT TIME U CALL IN A ORDER.... DON'T WAIT IN LINE.. JUST COME RIGHT UP. with a big smile. (that was cool, considering while IN LINE on YELP i read that was the thing to do... smh.i gotta start reading faster.. it would have saved me 3-6mins)  Sooo all in all, even though i didn't get what i ordred, i was fine with the mistake made. I was more than happy with the way it was handled by the young lady.   Good Job, I will be back. (kinda pricey...combo #12 is a Two Dog Combo = 8.69 --- really????)",

I got the chicken salad sandwich to-go for lunch which came with chips and a container of fruit. The bread was great. The filling was okay. I had no trouble eating it for lunch and was relatively filling. There's a good amount of chicken in their chicken salad so not a lot of filler. The potato chips are thinly sliced but not very flavorful (It seemed unevenly salted). I finished off the lunch with a giant chocolate chip cookie which had the right level of sweetness but a bit too hard for my tastes.",

It was ready within a minute and it was more than I had asked for.  the bun tasted fresh to the point that if it were warm I could've been convinced it just came out of the oven.  the hot dog had a good snap to it but was still tender.  The cole slaw was tasty but a the cabbage, and carrots could've been cut a little smaller.  Same with the onions.

Now that I am recalling the experience, I am looking forward to another visit when I am Uptown.  The fries (my daughter's) were not to my liking but the tea was acceptable.

It's in a strip with many good looking lunch places but I was craving a hot dog.  I ordered the carolina dog combo.  Seemed like a reasonable price for an uptown lunch stop.  The food was ready pretty quickly.  The dog was a big ole mess; understanding that \"big\" and \"mess\" are good things.  I really liked the slaw and the chili had good flavor.  You got the mustard flavor in there too while still being able to taste the actual dog.  Nice blend.  The poppy seed bun was different but good.  Though, I was always prefer a toasted bun.  Staff was really friendly and drove this review to 4 stars.",

    "text": "Die hard Chicagoan here....so my expectations are somewhat \"elevated\" when it comes to food from my beloved hometown. Like Nicole said, is it the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Not even close. Is it the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? I say YES. They've got the traditional ingredients down pat, the Vienna beef sausage (yes, that's what a \"hot dog\" is.....an encased meat sausage), the neon green relish, the steamed poppy seed bun (which is the quintessential defining part of a Chicago dog), sport peppers, tomato, a pickle and MUSTARD (Chicago dogs NEVER, repeat, NEVER EVER use Ketchup!).   So I got a Chicago Dog and a special called the Fire Dog today which was a spicy Polish sausage with grilled onions, brown mustard and I opted for the sauerkraut. It was a good dog, with all the flavors expected. Fries are usually good here, but my criticism is that they lack some seasonings.....hell use Lawry's Seasoned Salt or something and fry them a tad longer to get more of a crisp on them. They're not bad but certainly CAN be better!  Being a lover of Portillos, Mr. Beef and Al's in Chicago, Matt's version of Chicago Beef is just meh.....sausage isn't bad but their beef just isn't flavorful enough for my tastes. I mean it's not bad, just not up to my expectation from what I remember from back home. OK now I'm being picky and critical.....me bad.   For first time visitors, just know that the portions are NOT very big (at least for the dogs). Recommend getting a combo with 2 Chicago Dogs or a combo Beef/Sausage. Even the females in my group complained that one dog wasn't quite enough. Jumbo dog is also an option. They should offer a TWO DOG JUMBO combo for us bigger eaters.  So overall I love Matt's as it does provide me with a LITTLE taste of home. I can only hope that SOMEONE opens up a REAL CHICAGO PIZZA place here in Charlotte....while I love thin pizza, there IS MUCH BETTER out there so please someone, open a Giordano's here! PLEASE! :-)",

Yes, it's April 2012 and Yelp tells me that I've had Matt's bookmarked since December 2010 after reading Cassandra's ROTD. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/matts-chicago-dog-charlotte#hrid:Kn7dQhdcPMfAv-UTRkQjxA\">yelp.com/biz/matts-chica...</a>. And so with my hot dog craving unsatisfied from several attempts, here I am.  Popped in towards the end of the lunch hour and was able to find a seat to drop off my backpack. At the register, I went with the eponymous Chicago Dog of course. But I knew that one hot dog wouldn't fill me up, so I had a Carolina Dog to go with it. And a Diet Coke, to cancel out all those bad calories.  The Chicago Dog was made almost perfectly traditionally. An all-beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun, topped with sport peppers (a little too hot for my taste, I took one bite and had to put them to the side), tomato wedges, chopped onions, yellow mustard, celery salt and that green relish that practically glowed in the dark. The only ding is that the pickle was a slice (lengthwise) rather than a spear. It doesn't matter to me personally, but a Chicago Dog connoisseur might be upset. Whatever, it tasted AWESOME.  The Carolina Dog was ON THE MONEY. Also an all-beef hot dog, it was topped chili, mustard, chopped onion, and cole slaw. Messy as all get out, but I was prepared and didn't wear any of it home.  After seeing the mentions of the fries, I skipped 'em. Free refills on the soda. If it's a nice day (and it was!) take it outside.  Oh, and that pesky craving for hot dogs? Totally slayed.",

It's located off of the Green which is great if you are sitting in a cubicle all day and need some vitamin D.  They keep it pretty simple... dogs and burgers/sandwiches.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming with options, but I haven't had a bad sandwich or item here.  You come in, fall into line, place your order, and wait for your delicious food to be brought to the table (dining in) or your number to be called out (take out).  The dining space is small and cramp (like everything else in uptown) but they make the most out of the space with plenty of tables, sometimes it's hard to procure a table yourself, but the turn around is quick and you also have the option of taking the food outside on the Green.  Pretty interesting mural painted on the wall to make it look like you aren't inside, but outside on the street - props to the artist that can paint glass reflections on the store windows.  OK... I haven't had a chicago dog here (gasp!) but all the rest of the food I have had here has been very solid so I am sure their Chicago dogs are great.  It's not Chicago, but it can definitely hold it's own.",

I don't even know if there is another place that offers Italian Beef on their menu, but I would still eat another one here if I was pheenin' for one.   Another Chicago fav is the pizza puff. Not much they need to do with it but fry it. Can't go wrong except for destroying any diet plans and giving you a tad of heartburn for us older folks. One was good enough for me...two might be pushing it. $3.99 each and no option to make it a combo meal.  The cheese used for the cheese fries is an absolute \"boooo!\". I will not try those again.",

This place would be very mediocre in Chicago. They have Vienna beef which is nice but it's not the same taste as the solid Vienna Beef hot dog joints in Chicago. They also sliced my spear pickle into a small section which is super cheap.  Never see that in Chicago. The other toppings were good. I don't expect a Portillo's or Gene and Jude's quality in Charlotte but I think this could be better. The staff is somewhat friendly and overall it's better than any thing else you will find around Charlotte so I will give it three stars. That splitting the spare pickle just rubs me the wrong way. How much does a pickle really cost? I paid $7.49 for a dog, drink and fries so really?",

I've never had a hot dog topped with peppers and tomatoes before so that was a bit funky.....but good kinda funky.   As others have said, the fries were mushy and soft but I am equal opportunity when it comes to fried potatoes and will eat whatever you put in front of me. $6 something for a lunch combo with side (fries or chips) and drink (free refills-holla!) is a great deal in my eyes and you can eat outside if the weather is nice. When I went in for a refill, I noticed the Wunder Bar---chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick. I will most definitely be back for that after another tasty dog.",

I have never had an Italian beef sandwich before so I was eager.  Drove around the block downtown until I found parking in the garage next door. A short walk up the stairs and Matts was there, facing the courtyard.  The dining room was semi-full.  We arrived for lunch on a Friday and I honestly thought there would be a long wait so I was pleasantly surprised.  The line moved quickly and our order was efficiently taken.  We were given a number and sat down with our drinks.  I ordered the Italian beef, spicy with fries and a Chicago style hot dog.  My partner ordered the Turkey Club salad (low carb).  Our food arrived within 5-7 minutes.  I dug right into the beef sandwich and it was pretty spicy.  Just the right amount for me.  The fries were fresh cut and they were hot and crispy.  The hot dog was very good.  The salad was a salad.  Nothing fancy. As I sit here two hours later my stomach is rumbling again.  I want another sandwich!!!.  If I am downtown I will definitely try them again.",

Help was friendly and professional. They had variety of hot dogs sandwiches and salads. We had a corn beef salad on toasted marble bread which was excellent and an oriental chicken salad which was fresh and substantial. The dressing was lights and not overbearing. We ate outside in a courtyard which overlooks a beautiful small Park.",

    "text": "Yes! Yes! Yes! This place has made this Chicago native very happy!!! First time in and was greeted right away (bonus points), menu has a large variety which is great but, let's not kid, it's about the Italian Beef (for me anyway). Outside of Chicago a good Italian Beef is hard to find, glad I have to search no longer. It was soooooooooo yummy! I love mine with both hot and sweet peppers, double dipped please! I am stuffed! The sweet potato fries were just as I like mine, thick cut! My husband got the cheesy beef with sausage and onion rings. I know somethings good when he doesn't speak and only nods his head. Haha. The icing on the cake for me was the fact that they sell Chicago pizza puffs! Haven't had one since I young, taste just like I remember. So good! If you've never had one before you need to order one! They have gained a new set of regulars. We will be trying the hot dogs next visit. But, definitely recommend that you stop by and give them a try.",

    "text": "A decent substitute. While it's not True authentic Chicago offerings, those of us from the Windy City area will be at least happy to taste something so familiar to us. The deep dish was ok, the Chicago Dogs are good, as is the Polish and Italian Beef. Is it Lou Malnati's? No...is it Al's Beef? Not a chance...but without any other Chicago staples anywhere to be found, it's something that will fill in until you're able to get back to Chicago for the real thing. 7 out of 10 is how I'd rate them...not terrible, but not great either...like I said...decent",

    "text": "Update at the end.  This review is based solely on the reuben and not the traditional food at Matt's (hot dogs). If you're looking to grab a hot dog, continue looking at the other reviews.  I continued my journey around Charlotte to find the best reuben with a stop at Matt's Chicago Dog. It seemed like an odd place to serve a reuben, but it was on the menu nonetheless. They should probably just stick with the traditional Chicago foods. The corned beef was rubbery, clearly boiled (and over-boiled at that), while the kraut was barely noticeable on the sandwich. The bread was barely crisped, which led to an unpleasant soggy bottom piece. The flavors were OK, but the sandwich itself left much to be desired. Certainly not the worst reuben around the Queen City, but not worth making a stop for.  Update - the owner reached out and let me know they made some improvements to their Reuben and that I should swing by and try it. I did the other day and it is improved! No more rubbery corner beef and the kraut had really good flavor. Appreciate the owner taking the feedback and making some changes - its worth stopping by to check out!",

    "text": "Sad Excuse for a hot dog.   If you're looking for mediocrity this is your place. Overall, do not order a hot dog.   I love a good chili dog. But this, unfortunately, could never amount to my expectations.   We were hoping they could muster up something at least edible.   Too much bread! Every bite was either only bread or more bread than dog. The cheese was just falling off the top, not melted in whatsoever. Cheap!   I asked to add some fresh jalapeno peppers. Instead of chopping and sprinkling within, like a normal cadet would do; they decided to throw in a few full peppers on the bun. What am I suppose to do with that? It's not to replace the dog, I'm not going bite into a bulb of a jalapeno pepper. It's to add some God damn flavor not overtake the whole meal. Fail.   Tasteless. I repeat. There was absolutely no flavor. That meat, the chili was bland substance added to a cheap hot dog.  Let's also say that one hot dog was $5, that in itself is way too high. I wouldn't buy another one of these, but if I mentioned it's True value, maybe $0.50 per, make it two for a buck, it's barely worth that, but absolutely not $5, much better options for something that actually has flavor elsewhere. Be warned.   Usually I like to say something nice about a place to offset the negatives, however, I regrettably can not say anything good about this place. Nothing to say about the staff, barely noticeable.  Note; This review is based on Hot Dog entirety. Not the other items on the menu which they might do better with.",

It was extremely crowded so we waited a very long time to place out order at the front counter.  There was a NC state convention of fire rescue professionals who happened to be on their lunch break so that accounted for the enormous crowd.  There is quite an extensive menu of items.  A number of hotdog selections, many sandwiches, some salads and chicken items.  A good menu.  Taking a number that flew on our table, it took some time before our order arrived but the server took in and satisfied any additions or corrections and we were happy.  My egg salad sandwich was excellent, toasted rye bread and a good mound of egg salad.  Iced tea was refillable.  The kids love root beer and they were ecstatic as sodas are not part of their home pantry.  Right across from the museums, there are a number of eateries, Matt's being just one of them.  Matt's was good and the food well done.  A nice break from the museums which can be reentered that day and the next.  The museum ticket was also valid through the next day at the Randolph Road Mint museum, so it is a good deal.  Take the kids.",

The hotdog did not have much flavor and the small amount of chili and cheese didn't provide much flavor over the taste of the soft steamed bun. Don't get me wrong, the chili dog wasn't bad, it just wasn't something you're going to tell your friends about.  Prices are fair, expect to pay 10.00-15.00 for lunch.",

    "text": "I love how places like this are giving us non beef, pork, and meat eaters the option to indulge in their savory selections!!! This is the perfect place for a quick lunch if you are in the mood for a hot dog. They also have other offerings, which I hear are amazing as well.   Yesterday I got the veggie dog Carolina style with the hand cut fries. When I first saw my basket I thought \"I see what that yelper meant by small portions\". However, it is a perfect portion and just right for a lunch. I left feeling like my hunger was appeased and not like I needed a nap.  For an American diet yes it is a \"small\" portion because it's not a heaping platter of food that you don't really need. I'm not saying the food is healthy because, well, fried potatoes lol. I am saying that for me a portion conscious eater it was just right!    The veggie dog was delicious! I almost thought it was beef for a second but it didn't have that nasty beefy bloody taste. The slaw was perfect, and the mustard and onion satisfied my Carolina craving. I really loved how the fries weren't salted. Maybe they just forgot, but I hate salty fries because I love ketchup and there's plenty of salt for me there.   I came around 11:30 which was a perfect time if you are like me and want to beat the lunch rush, which is a really big deal downtown with so many options to choose from and the pleasantries of the Overstreet Mall. Matts isn't located in the \"mall\", it is on The Green, which is not as crowded as other areas downtown (maybe because it's not in the center of the uptown area).   Amazing food, great location, great people and a park... what more do you need to get you through the day?! I will definitely be back to try other items!",

Our \"dogs\" which were Carolina style (mustard, chili and slaw) were promptly delivered to the table.  The buns were perfectly steamed (that is so important).  Chili was just right !!!!   The slaw was just a bit too mayonnaise for me but it was good.  We chose the fresh cut fries (just like Five Guys).  Hot and delicious.  This place was a home run !!!  Many hot dog and burger choices.    They even gave us a free refill on our sweet tea !",
