Located at the backside of the building, so not really on N Tryon St.   Had the Shrimp and Chive Dumpling appetizer and definitely satisfies any craving for leek I've had, but definitely too oily. Had the Spicy Thai Curry with Tofu and it was flavorful and wonderfully spicy! Also tried the Garlic Shrimp and Scallop dish, which was also nicely flavored.   Felt weird eating Chinese food with a fork, so I asked for a pair of chopsticks, but the chopsticks were crap, you know the kind that break apart at a strange place and taste like chemically treated wood. Bah!   Overall a good place to soothe my major Chinese food cravings!",

They have an extensive vegetarian menu, and also will make the standard meat dishes vegetarian.  Ownership and staff is top-notch.

Also, whenever I come here for dinner I am literally the only customer in the dining area. I think that Soho Bistro must really be only a lunch place.",

Ordered sesame tofu since it's my old faithful at any Chinese restaurant... and boy was I impressed!  Definitely the best sesame tofu I've had since \"House\" on Independence closed down. Tofu was a perfect amount of chewy and crispy and not overly sauced.   Steamed white rice was delish and spring rolls were definitely superior than any other I've had, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly why.  Vegetarian friendly.  The only down to this restaurant, like any business in downtown Charlotte, is that you have to park in a deck or meter on the street (if you can find one). I know for sure that Hearst Tower parking tickets can be validated by Soho so that parking is free!",

YOU CANNOT GET HERE FROM TRYON***  Four years after leaving south Charlotte I finally find a Chinese place with reasonable enough prices and good enough food to rival Taipei South!  Everything I've tried at this place is fantastic! Several months back I brought my mom in here for a lunch break while showing her around town and now every time she comes to visit and lunch or dinner time rolls around she wants to go to Soho. It's only the large number of other great restaurants in the area that keeps us from eating here every time.   The egg rolls are perfectly crispy without being greasy. If you order something with shrimp you actually get a decent amount of shrimp. This alone is enough to make Soho stand out among all the other Chinese restaurants in the same price range and even some that are considerably more expensive.",

They still were serving lunch at 330 which ROCKED for moi, who is a chronic late luncher since my job lets me sleep in a bit :) Parking in the Hearst Tower lot is the best idea since they validate your ticket, so be sure to bring it in with you!  A smaller place than I expected, there's a great, mellow vibe here. The lights that hang over the tables are beautifully warm with medium colored wood and soft white bulbs inside frosted glass. While empty when we arrived, I can definitely see this place being crowded at lunchtime between 1130-130 so heads up on that! Calling it in seemed to be a pretty good option and one that was utilized alot while we were there!  Starting off with crab ragoons and asian fresh rolls, we shared and IMO the crab ragoons really shone about and beyond. The fresh rolls were good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce they came with (reminded me of an Indian fig sort of thick sauce) and the duck sauce wasn't meshing well with it either.  I ordered the General Tofu and while I feel like I'm piggy-backing onto Elizabeth's review, it was True that the tofu was PERFECT. I mean, HOLYYYY MOTHER THIS IS PERFECT. From the fry (not overly but not soggy under), to the sauce (I asked for it extra spicy, and they delivered!), to the picking of your own veggie (I choose brocoli which came out not mushy, not stiff but the almost unreachable middle ground) and the delish spring roll (something is added to this that is not in most - no clue what but it makes it hearty but still light).  The service was attentive, kind and accommodating, the space was intimate yet casual and the food was stellar. That's a WIN WIN WIN in my book! Enjoy!",

I have to say it does NOT compare to Chinese back at home.  I ordered potstickers (called dumplings here) and the skin was too thick and there was barely any meat inside.  Not a good first impression.  I wanted chow mein so I ordered the House Lo Mein...too salty.  They put too much oyster sauce or soy sauce.  This also made the noodles squirmy.   I ordered broccoli on the side and at least that was good.   I hope there are better Chinese food spots out here.  Since this place was in Uptown I hope this isnt the best they got...  3 stars because their service was good",

I make it by there less frequently now, but I have been back a few times. It's worth the trip!  My favorite lunch special is the Cantonese rice noodles without the chicken and shrimp. It's spicy, and it seems healthy. I'm sure it's cooked in a lot of oil, but it's a healthier option that a lot of the quick lunch alternatives.  It can get crowded at Soho for lunch, so we usually ordered online or called in and went to pick it up. Parking can be kind of a pain in this area of uptown, so we usually took two people in the car and left one to wait while the other ran inside.  Another great reason for going to Soho if you're ordering with an office is that it's located pretty close to the PIta Pit and the uptown Fuel. We'd sometimes stop at all three to get something for everybody.  The prices are good, and the service is quick and friendly. I've never been let down by Soho.",

I appreciated it since no one likes to go eat lunch wif me *sniffle* (They all pack their own lunches or don't eat - \"Lunch is for wimps!).  But yesterday, I had lunch buddies, yay!  We all had the lunch special which came out in a timely manner and the place was poppin'.  It was a birthday, so I asked the manager/server if they had anything special for birfdays, she said No.  I said, okay, makes sense - who comes here for birthday lunch.  I ordered a chocolake cake though anyways.    Lunch was solid, maybe a little on the sweet side.  I had the chicken/shrimp/mixed vegetables and the sauce was a little sweet.  General Tsao's chicken (?) was also a little sweet my buddy said.  Oh yeah, AVOID the innocuous looking mustard bottle.  It's not your average mustard sauce that comes in the little packets from Chinese restaurants.  This one was sinus-clearing, eyes-water, fire-breathing. Yeah, it was so hot.  At the end, they brought out the cake.  Low and behold, it had a witto candle on top which the manager/owner had to keep from blowing out with the wine glass (damn, asian people are smart!).  It was a nice way to end the impromptu birfday lunch.  Will I go here again?  Prob after I've dated a GF for a few months. It's a dimly lit, quaint comfortable Chinese food spot - like a solid 8th dinner date or a 4-year-been-with-the-ball-&-chain(wifey)-and-we-need-to-pretend-we-still-have-romantic-dates place.   dmo out.",

I ordered my food at 8:05 pm, the receptionist quoted that our food would be delivered in 30 minutes...it took a  hour and 45 minutes!!!! After waiting a hour, I called to check on the status of our delivery, the receptionist told me, \"it hasn't been a hour!\", I was flabbergast! Why would she lie to me? What happened to good customer service?! I told her, \"Ma'am, I'm looking at my call times, it's now 9:05.\" She replied, \"well your food's on the way!\". I said, \"Is it en route or are you just saying that?\"....THEN...THE LADY HUNG UP ON ME!!! WHAT??!!!! If it was just my food, I would have cancelled the order! When the delivery guy came, I snapped and made clear that I would write a scathing review, b/c the receptionist is HORRIBLE! I concluded it was unfair to project on him, my frustrations for his sorry co-worker(his name is Gaston and he was VERY nice actually); I tipped him and sent him on his way!

We parked at Church and 5th thinking it was just around the corner but then had to walk two blocks which wasn't a pleasant walk on our way back from dinner when it got chilly and rainy.  Ambiance: Intimate. Soft lighting and pleasant music. We went at a time when the restaurant wasn't crowded. Only 4 tables were occupied, but I believe this place must be packed for lunch.  Service was courteous and our food arrived in reasonable time. Our server kept our glasses full.  We ordered the Summer Roll and Hot and Sour Soup. The Summer Rolls were as good as any others (they all taste the same) but the veggies were fresh. The Hot and Sour soup was good (we split it). For the entree we had the Mongolian chicken, which was mind blowing. It had just the right amount of spice, hot enough to open up my blocked sinuses, but not overly spicy. The flavors perfectly melded. The portions were large enough. Me and my boyfriend left the place with full tummies and some leftover Mongolian chicken.",

The spring roll was a little disappointing, no real filler.  As for the veggies and chicken, delish, but skimpy on the baby shrimp, will pass on that option next time. And, unfortunately I was given brown rice, or maybe it was fried, if so, not great, and on the colder side. Overall, it is a quick lunch, with good prices, but nothing stood out in my mind.",

I'm impressed by how fast this place can be. I walked in on a weekend night and the place was packed. People were waiting for tables to empty. I just wanted some takeout. I was expecting a longer than normal wait. But no. Five minutes or so after walking in, I had a bag in my hand full of piping hot food and was walking back to the office.   I have limited options - for health reasons - on what I can order, so I should not be the last word on the menu in any place. So I have mainly stuck to some of the healthier items like Sa Cha chicken or the steamer plates. Even though it's fast, it's always good.

The place is still awesome.  The atmosphere is still peaceful and quiet, and the wait staff efficient and polite.  We ordered four items off the menu: scallion pancakes, crab wontons, tangerine chicken and sesame shrimp.  The scallion pancakes were just as good as they ever were.  The crab wontons were a bit disappointing - we were expecting something closer to crab Rangoon (based on the description) but these are more grainy than creamy.  The filling almost looked like cous cous or quinoa.  Despite this, we ate all but two of them, so they were still good.  My tangerine chicken was OUTSTANDING.  From first bite to last, it was delicious and is my new favorite thing.  My daughter's sesame shrimp was also delicious (she let me have a bite) although she thought it was a little too sweet.  Staff was quick to refill drinks throughout the meal, and our total bill for dinner was $38 - a relative bargain considering we had two appetizers, two entrees and multiple refills on my daughter's soda.    I continue to recommend this place for good Chinese food at a great price.  Can't wait until my next event uptown so that I can dine here again!",

Sad to say, my entree was a little bland. It was a tofu, vegetables, and wide rice noodles entree.  It surely looked spectacular with the varied vibrant colors and large portion size, but it failed to delivery on tastiness!  No bother, I drowned the sucker in chile sauce and soy sauce until it was more edible. The tofu spring rolls appetizer suffered from a similar tastelessness.    At least service was prompt and everything was salvageable with a little doctoring up.  I suspect that the omnivore dishes may be more palatable as my companion didn't seem bothered, but she is polite gal, so who knows!  The large portion size did permit me to chow down again later, which is always appreciated when I am about to possibly spend all night throwing back drinks, with little or no vegan options immediately available.

    "text": "Lunch time!  A few co-workers and I ventured over to Soho last week for lunch.  So close to my former work space, and CROWDED if you go right at noon.  The tables seem to turn fast, but I'd recommend going before or after the lunch rush.  We had to wait a good 10 minutes for a table that could hold a group of 4 people.  We had two more peeps, but we needed to take what we could get.  After being seated, a bigger table opened up and asked if we could move so all 6 of us could sit together.  They kindly said we could!  Ordered the garlic shrimp dish and it was so good!  Food came out about 10 to 15 minutes after ordering! Prices are decent for the portion size.    Small interior and cramped tables.  Wouldn't recommend for parties over 4 if you are going at lunch.",

Does 5 slices of beef equal $2 ON TOP of what I originally ordered ? NO. I also asked the rude lady for a side of sriracha, but she purposely gave me hot chili oil. I rarely ever write such negative reviews, but the quality, quantity and disgusting attitude makes me NEVER want to return. They lost out on catering opportunity for my team at B of A as well.

I used to get chicken rice soup from TinTin and was never impressed.  The chicken there was always a little \"iffy\".  Soho's CNS is delightful.  I was greeted with large broccoli florets, slices of zucchini, bok choy and LOTS of good quality chicken. The chicken had a good texture and was cut-able with a spoon.  I ordered with rice noodles which came nestled in the bottom of the container and were not over done.  The broth was light and full of flavor.  It wasn't too salty and was a delicious end of soup drink.  As a happy bonus I got fried wontons with the soup.  They were large and fresh; A tasty crunch. Once again, Soho Bistro knocks it out of the park!",

    "text": "In a lunch rush? You can count on Soho to delivery hot, plentiful edibles in the time it takes some people to get through a long drive-through line. Husband and I met up for lunch just a couple minutes after noon. By 12:30, we'd dined and had the check in hand.  Service is prompt, and polite/friendly in a rushed kind of way - they know how to get people in and out, on the double. We were checked on by three different servers, plus one more at the end of our meal after we'd finished eating and the plates had been cleared, who wanted to make sure someone had taken our order!  Husband likes the sweet & sour chicken, which always looks well prepared, though I've never tried it since it's not a favorite of mine. This time I went for the Thai Curry Shrimp ($6.99). The curry sauce tasted more in line with flavors I'd expect from Indian food - sweet and heavy on the turmeric - and like it maaay have had its origins in a bottle or package of some kind, but it was still good, and pleasantly, mildly spiced. There were large chunks of vegetables in the mix, and they are not stingy with the shrimp. The brown rice was good and chewy, and spring rolls served piping hot and crispy, straight from the fryer.  It may not be the most authentic international cuisine you'll ever eat, but when pressed for time and watching your budget, Soho is as great as anything you could want.  One last thing - be care with the address! While the city may put it on Tryon, the entrance is actually on College. I spent several minutes walking up and down Tryon between 5th and 6th, looking to no avail before finally calling Husband, who directed me down to the next street.",

I wonder if he was telling us that the food was free because it was just OK?  Well, when the gal at the front saw me looking around she finally came by to get the check.  Then we ordered a to go lunch which took forever.  Come to find out it was already sitting at the front waiting.  I caught the same girls eyes which is when she finally motioned that the food was there already.  Really? You couldn't come over to the table to tell us?  I can see why she wouldn't hand the to go food to us before we paid but at least tell me it is there already.  The food was just OK.  Considering I live in California where we have a lot of True Asian restaurants.  I ordered the noodle soup with egg noodles and the noodles they used were the  fat noodles rather than the thin egg noodles which is what you would normally see in a True Asian restaurant.  It had a good flavor but fat noodles do not do anything for me.  Then I thought, let me try their house fried rice. I normally judge the Chinese Restaurant by the presentation of their house fried rice.  Have you ever ordered a regular fried rice from a Chinese restaurant?  Normally the regular fried rice they just in a frying pan add some soy sauce and that's it.  This was they also added some meat, shrimp and bean sprouts.  I wonder if I should give them my recipe for Yang Chow Fried Rice?  The house fried rice flavor was just OK and I would not call it anything better.    Just OK food is exactly what it is.  There you have it.",

    "text": "In brief: Snarky attitude, mediocre food (literally where's the beef?! in my beef dish?), generic Asian fusion decor, but convenient location in downtown Charlotte.  I came here with some people and hoped for passable Asian food. Being that I live in NYC, I am Asian, I travel to East Asia to basically worship food and such, I ADORE food. I figured I will lower my expectations for what is delicious due to its proximity away from Asian-centric epicenters. I don't want to be unfair and judge them due to circumstances beyond their reach.   Yes, I love authentic Chinese food but I am also cool with Americanized Chinese food too. Please note the fact that the restaurant serves Americanized Chinese food isn't the reason for the low rating. I regularly order Americanized Chinese food when I want to confuse my mother and talk about crab rangoon. *smiles*  Here is the problem- our server has a major attitude problem! The two sisters who own the place need to keep in mind they are in the SERVICE industry- snarky comments won't help you. If you asked my table what we want to drink and one of us said hot and sour soup, don't roll your eyes and repeat your question as if my dining companion is an idiot! She wants to drink soup, so be it! What happened to the motto, \"The (thirsty) customer is always right?\" ;)  There were only a few slices of beef in my beef dish, super miserly it seemed about their portions overall.  The vegetables have seen better days and yikes, I can taste the MSG. Presentation was non-existent. At least the food came to us piping hot!   It seemed that other people dining there had to flag down the waitstaff for simple requests such as water refills as well.   I will definitely NOT return.",

This restaurant is located in the Hearst Tower but the entrance is on College Street across from the Holiday Inn and Merts.    The place has nice decor, the seating is a little uncomfortable though.  Chairs are the right height but the tables seemed low.  The menu has plenty of selections for meat eaters and vegetarians.  There are like 40 (exageration) types of soup and several appetizers.  Portions are huge!  On a visit before a concert at Spirit Square, I had the Chicken with Garlic Sauce with brown rice.  The presentation was outstanding with a carrot in ribbon form displayed on my plate for color.  The chicken dish had peppers and other veggies is a light brown sauce.  Unfortunately, this was supposed to be a spicy dish.  Why is it so hard for Chinese restaurants to do spicy?  On a scale of 1 to five on spice, this was about a 1/2.   Flavor was ok, I just wanted heat!    Prices are great for what you get and the staff is super friendly here.  Our waiter had to ask twice on what I ordered and still missed the brown rice. But he was great at refilling water glasses.",

Let me start off by saying no one can get egg drop soup or crab rangoon horribly wrong but I wasn't very fond of the sauce that came with my veggies. It was reddish in color a bit tangy and sweet. I would have liked some alternatives. I saw other people's food and it looked like food you could order from the local American style Chinese food...However it wasn't as greasy as looking here. Maybe I just don't know bit Ive Been around plenty of Chinese food and this just didn't give the vibe of the style I like, that's all. Not necessarily bad here but for my tastes it just wasn't right.

A fair mix of Cantonese and Mandarin dishes, including some Curry Noodles, Cantonese Rice Noodles, Sha Cha Chicken and a ton of seafood dishes including (!) Mahi Mahi.  I went with the Cantonese Noodles and they were around a B/B+. I think they could have made the noodles much spicier and gone heavier on the seasonings. My friend ordered a General Tso's Tofu, which was delightfully crispy and sweet on the outside but perfectly soft on the inside. He also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken appetizer which was served satay-style on a skewer. This again was good, though fairly dumbed-down for what (I assume) the owners think is a spice-averse audience in Charlotte.  So, in spite of the good review, my message to SoHo is this: DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE THE FOOD MORE AUTHENTIC. BE BRAVE! Look, you might be thinking most Americans want bland Chinese food - but, the times, they are a changin'. There are a ton of culturally educated, adventurous foodies out there and they are DYING for legit Chinese cuisine. Go forth and give us a place to call home!",

    "text": "The first time I ate here was on a Sunday evening around 7pm. The food was terrible--chicken tasted like leftover bits from the week before and diced to be almost the size of grains of rice. Everything was bland and coated in too much corn starch, and I thought I would never eat here again; however, my opinion of the place has greatly changed in the last week.   I decided to give this place another shot, to be fair. My second order was Monday at noon. Take out was ready in 10 minutes. Chicken in the eggplant special was overcooked, but flavor was great and you could tell everything was fresh and handmade. I've eaten here several (12) times since then, and it is my new favorite lunch spot. If you want authentic Chinese that reminds you of the homeland, this isn't it; however, it is good for what it is.  Pros: -Fast -Flavor is good and distinctive between dishes -No food poisoning or emergency bathroom trips -Brown rice or fried rice offered as sides with no upcharge -Can order online without requiring credit card payment -Lunch specials come with spring rolls  -Can customize any dish without complaints--add veggies, change sauce, you name it! No upcharge for substitutions -Portions large for the price. -Everything on lunch menu under $8 -Everything is homemade--even wontons in wonton soup use whole wheat flour! -Restaurant looks clean -Food not swimming in grease, fried items are nicely fried -Everybody knows your name (well, kind of--the two sister owners have incredible memory)  Cons: -American-style Chinese food, so there is sometimes scary red food coloring in your food -Dumplings, while homemade, have no filling. Filling is awesome and tasty if you get some, but I just got dough.  -Meat is cooked inconsistently--sometimes I get dishes right on the verge of being cooked; other times it's overcooked. Shrimp and veggies are always perfect (yeah, I don't get it either). -Weekday lunch chef A+++; other chefs not so good.   Moral of the story? Go here for a quick, tasty, sometimes healthier alternative to the Epicenter at lunch. Stay away at dinner.",

Tip: online ordering available.   I have been to Soho for both work lunches and weekend takeout. I have never had a bad experience. The portions are large and the prices are fair. I usually go with the Kung Pao chicken or Mongolian beef; classic Americanized recipes. I appreciate the plentiful amount of peanuts they use in the Kung Pao.   They are experts at the lunch rush hour - I can be seated, served, and billed all around 30 minutes. You can tell they have been doing this a while.   Keep it up!",

    "text": "I had a hankering for an egg roll one day. Sometimes these things happen. If you don't judge me, I won't judge you. I poked around on my Yelp App until I found a decent place near to where I was lurking that day. Soho Bistro has a rather fancy website that I found I couldn't resist!  I ordered a few things, because you can't just get egg rolls. What about when you are also craving crab rangoon? And, hey, look they've got honey walnut prawns on the menu. Seaweed salad? That sounds healthful, and I tend to like seaweed. Let's do it!  - Egg rolls - straightforward. did the job. - Crab rangoon - really really mushy and had.. carrot in there? shredded carrot? I can't say I liked it. - Honey walnut prawns - No. They were fried and came in a thick brown sauce with vegetables. This is not what it's supposed to look like. These were definitely NOT the droids I was looking for. - Seaweed salad - Awesome, if a bit plain. I could have done without the pointless bed of shredded lettuce on the bottom. But the seaweed itself was awesome. - Sauce - The sweet and sour sauce that generally comes with the fried goodies was really weird here. It was really dark red and syrupy, and did not taste very pleasant. I can't recommend it.  Huge bonus points for  1. having a great website  2. having a menu on the website.  3. being able to order online.  4. having a REALLY awesome staff person answer the phone, answer questions, and even brought my food to the curb before I even slowed to a stop.  The place is definitely different, but I'm willing to give some of the other stuff a try. Being Chinese, I'm really picky about my Chinese food, and I've already rejected most of the other joints in the area.",

Like many Chinese restaurants, their spiciness scale could use some calibration--the food is never as spicy as I'd like.   However, the flavors and quality more than makes up for that. They are very speedy and the food is always cooked to perfection (no over-cooked, mushy veggies like you'll get at some places). The meat and produce is always good quality and I really like that they don't drown their dishes in sauce.",

I do not do fried food, if I can help it, Husband had Pepper Beef, our son and his friend had  Seafood Pan Fried Noodles and I had Mulan Duck.  It was absolutely delicious!   We thoroughly enjoyed the friendly service, and the fast dinner served; we were going on a walking tour and we had an hour to get there.  The four of us were impressed with the richness of the food, and shared our dishes with one another.  We were there at about 6:45 on a Friday night and the place was nice and low key.  I like a place where we can hear our conversations at a 4 top, without having to shout over the din of a crowded restaurant.    We will definitely be back Thank you Soho Bistro!!",

It took me just less than 8 minutes to walk from my office to their door after placing the order, and voila!  My piping hot fresh lunch was ready to go! :)    All I can say about this place is that the service and food quality are consistently wonderful!  The food is NOT overly sugary or greasy in the sauce department, there are TONS of options (steamed baskets if you don't feel like eating heavy, fried dishes for the days you do, etc...) for all tastes, flavors, and moods... I'm just so glad that they're still around after all this time... I don't know what I do to get my delicious Chinese food fix if they weren't around!",

This was the wonton noodle soup that I ate straight from the container. I found a short piece of black hair in it. I can't even say how disgusted I am because I ate half of it while not paying attention. So who knows if I ate hair before discovering this one? The taste of the soup in total was lacking, but it was not bad enough to write a review about it. I was just going to carry on with my life. The piece of hair is what made me want to write this review. I am sorry, but please make sure your food is being prepared and checked as food should be.",

We went in there after 12:30: there were lots of people waiting to pick up their take out orders by the door. There were also a line of people waiting in line to pay their bills after dining in. After waiting for awhile, we were able to get a table. Half of the tables were occupied, and most people were almost done with their food. The waiter was quick to get our drinks. He gave us some time to look at the menu (which I was ready to order when he brought us our drinks, but the waiter was too fast and I couldn't catch him in time to place our orders). The food on the other hand, took forever! It was a good 20-25 mins before we got our food. While we were waiting, I saw lots of take out orders coming out of the kitchen. I don't think I am gonna go back to this restaurant, but I guess if I do, I will just order take out early.  Review for the food: I love that they have Okra on the menu! I got the Okra lunch special with beef and fried rice. The brown sauce they used for the okra and beef was good, but definitely high in sodium. I am kinda annoyed by the fried rice. I was totally expecting at least some carrots and onions with my fried rice. But fried rice at Soho bistro is merely white rice stir fried with soy sauce. I guess the stir fry made this fried rice, but all the other Chinese restaurants I have been to (which is a lot because 1. I am Chinese and I love Chinese food 2. I travel around the country and have my fair share of Chinese food from different restaurants) have veggies with their fried rice and often included BBQ pork.",

    "text": "We ordered the lunch fried rice to go last week and were pleasantly surprised by Soho, definitely want to come in for a sit down dinner. We really wanted to sit down for lunch but, didn't feel like we were dressed. I wasn't too hungry so we ordered a chicken fried rice to split for about $6-7. The food came out pretty quickly while we waited at the bar. The place was pretty packed for lunch service also. The container held a good amount of fried rice, a better deal than the Asian place off of trade street we get curry rice from. It was very flavorful! Had the perfect amount of spice for me, extra spicy!   Will be back for sure, cheers!",

It was pretty quiet when we arrived but busier as the night progressed.  We ordered some edamame to start.  The server recommended that we dip them in a mix of chili sauce and soy sauce.  I hadn't tried that before but I really appreciated the extra flavor punch.    I had the Soho Twin Delight which was a combo plate of Sesame Shrimp and Spicy Sha-cha Beef.  The dish was beautifully plated.  Both parts of the dish were well-seasoned.  It was served with a large pot of rice that was well-cooked.  The banter with our server was great and perfect for dinner at the end of a long day.  I'd recommend Soho Bistro for a good dinner/lunch if you're in the area.",

All I wanted was some decent tasting rice to go with my sesame chicken.",

The sesame chicken was decent. It was the best part of the meal. The spring roll was tasty but the egg roll was blah. I did not enjoy the house lo mein. The meat in it was gray and chewy. It lacked any flavor. The beef and broccoli also had a very strange taste to it....almost lemony?  Overall, I will not be coming back to SoHo Bistro. I ordered from them for the convenience but I'd prefer to drive somewhere and get decent Chinese food.",

They come with a sweet sauce, which is not peanutty.  The scallion pancake is really super fried so it's definitely a rare occasion treat.  The soups (hot and sour and veg tofu) were both excellent and I would get them again in a heartbeat.  The sesame tofu was to die for.  I was hoping it wasn't a super fried dish and it did seem fried, but it didn't make me sick at all, which fried food often does.  It is addictive and I ate way more than I planned to.  The only dish that disappointed me and that I wouldn't get again was the mongolian beef.  The beef was either fatty or tendon-y so there was very little meat that was edible in the dish.  Maybe I just lucked out with it?  Everything else was so great, though, that I won't hesitate to return.  One more criticism - where are the chopsticks?  Every Chinese restaurant should provide them!",

The staff was exceptionally friendly and our waiter was a young man who was very eager to please. Unfortunately, the food was sub-par. The egg roll and scallion pancakes were hot and tasty, but our entrees were disappointing. I ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but I have a shellfish allergy. They corrected the error, but when the chicken was served, it was burned and it was clear that the veggie garnishes were transferred from one plate to the other. My dinner companion ordered noodles which he described as tasting like watered down spaghetti with weak curry sauce. I can't stress how nice the people were, but the food portion could use a visit from Kitchen Nightmares.",

We called them minutes after placing the order to ask for utensils, and the driver had already left the restaurant (with utensils).  As for \"easy\", you can't beat online ordering that works as well in practice as in theory.  And all the flavors were exactly as they should be - potstickers/dumplings, fried rice, etc.  The food was a little greasier than I would have preferred, but if you order Chinese delivery, that's to be expected.  Confucius say, \"Four tune cookies for Soho Bistro.\"  A little less oil, and Tao/Tso would be a five star general.",

If you go to Soho for pick up don't follow their address to the T because it is actually on the other side of the building next to Fuel Pizza. Call ahead when you are about 5 minutes away and they will come outside to deliver your food. As far as the food goes, the dumplings are a little too doughy but the sauce is quite good. I would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland. I am not going to X this place out just yet I may give it another shot.

    "text": "Visited Charlotte during my vacation and must say this is one of the nicest more friendly people I met during my road trip and the service at this restaurant was par to none.  My server was very polite and helpful.  My comment to her after passing the menu right back to her was \"Suprise Me\".    What she started me off with perfectly stuffed fresh spring rolls.  I have had rolls from many asian restaurants, but non had this much shrimp inside.  Being use to other places that slice the shrimp and put less than half at times in the roll.  These were filled very nice and had great flavor.    She kept my tea glass full, which might I add I did not use any sugar.  It was fresh and tasted right.    My entree came out and it was pepper beef I think.  Crispy beef.  Great flavor, done so well with great seasoning and the rice was tender and nice.    I thoroughly enjoyed this visit to this business.  Stop in and enjoy.",

I also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl. Again, VERY bland. Not much of a coconut taste either. Thai food is my favorite and this just flat out does not taste like thai food.

The twins that work the front are awesome and transition everybody in and out as efficiently as possible. They have yet to mess up my order, despite being extremely overcrowded.  The food is tremendous and fresh. Their edimames are to die for. The steam them and salt them to perfection. If you are uptown and are craving chinese food, go to soho bistro.  7 on the legitimate big dog scale here. This place is as reliable as you can ever imagine. That's what's good.",

    "text": "When I use to work in Uptown Charlotte, I would typically eat here almost once a week.  It is rather small restaurant, and always has a line around Noon, but it's worth checking out.  Typically, I order the Tangerine Chicken with white rice and egg roll (substitute from spring roll); the wait time varies 5-10 minutes from order to table.  The portions are good compared to price and I never had any issues.  There is outside seating available, but its on the street and it can be pretty loud.  Overall, worth checking out if in the area and have a hankering for good Chinese food; if you go during the Lunch rush, try to go early or late.",

    "text": "Pretty good overall. I ordered a spring roll and an egg roll - both were a little bland (and greasy) for my taste.  The steamed veggies were perfectly cooked - a combination of broccoli , zucchini, carrots, sugar peas, and napa cabbage. (Heavy on the broccoli.) The white rice that came with my steamed veggies was also perfectly cooked.  I also tried the teriyaki chicken skewers - the flavor was excellent, as was the quality of the chicken (lean breast meat) - unfortunately it was a tad dry. I enjoyed it by adding an excess of dipping sauce :) I would try this restaurant again if I'm in the mood for Chinese food.   *On a side note, be aware that your delivery may not arrive when you request - my delivery came 25 min PRIOR to my requested time... just as I was getting out of the shower- yikes :)",

The food here is average to good, and is always packed during the work week at lunchtime.  Service is fast, but otherwise forgettable.  Prices are very good as well, you can get out of there if you sit down for about 10-12 bucks with tip.    I normally get the Tangerine chicken, or the beef and broccoli.  The chicken sometimes comes with too much sauce, but it has the right level of spiciness.    Overall, a good place to sate your craving for Chinese, but if you are looking for a great meal, look elsewhere.",

They have very gracious hostesses/cashier's.   You can't go wrong with their Chicken Fried Rice or Black Pepper Steak, those are my favorites.   They have your standard Chinese Food menu and it is nothing like a Panda Queen located in a strip mall, MUCH better than that nonsense.   Side Note: If you want to see efficiency at its finest, go during lunch time and watch the two cashier's work their magic, they can do so many things at once it will seriously impress you.",

This place is right across the street from my hotel but after a long day I just didn't feel like evening my room. I used their online ordering system which is super-easy and user friendly. Food arrived not even 20 minutes later on a Friday night. The beef with broccoli was in a plastic fridge/microwave-friendly to-go box and the crab wontons are delicious; not overly cream-cheesy. I'm here for two more weeks and will definitely be ordering again. Reasonably priced as well. ONLY bummer: they don't have Moo-Shoo Pork :-(",
