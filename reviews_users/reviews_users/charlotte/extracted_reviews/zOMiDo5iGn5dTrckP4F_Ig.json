Is called \"El Dominicano\" is pretty much a chimichurri but instead of bread they use a tortilla ?? LOL  but overall this place has great flavorful food for a good price Sunday's is half off domestic beers. Y'all have  try the pineapple habanero sauce is a amazing very spicy tho  ! Is just one of the many sauces to choose Fromm so well . Ive been here many times and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for my burrito falling apart everytime I order one.",

You receive a huge pile of chips and toppings that are delicious!   Unfortunately, our second trip was not quite as good. We went for Taco Tuesday and tried a total of six different tacos. Five of the tacos were completely without flavor and bland. The sixth was chorizo, which the Mrs. took one bite of and put down. I guess if the goal is to cover the tacos in a variety of available salsas, then you may be okay.   The final issue is that you will smell like the restaurant for the rest of the day. I guess than can be considered good or bad depending on your preference.   We will return if we really, really are in the mood for nachos.",

There are a few locations around the Charlotte area, the one in Indian Trail and the one up by the Novant hospital (formerly Presby main) are both better than this Pineville location as far as cleanliness and service but the food has been consistently great at all of them. They have a good selection of beverages including domestic and imported beers and basic mixed drinks (mojitos, margaritas, etc.). The sauces are really good as well but the food is already flavorful so you may find them unnecessary. I especially like that they have outlets with USB plug in at each table and booth and it's that kind of extra thought that brings me to 5 stars rather than just 4. I definitely recommend trying whichever Sabor is closest to you as soon as possible.",

It was obvious the steak wasn't super fresh; it was kind of cold. The burrito, although super large, didn't have too much flavor and the quinoa brown rice was pretty unappetizing. The dining area was pretty dirty too, tables had food all over them and hadn't been cleaned for a while. I would  give this another try and order something different but until then the 2 stars stands.",

Also if you're dining in and want a change, place an order through Uber eats... They'll deliver it right to your door. I recommend the nachos with shredded chicken. Enjoy!",

This place definitely hit the spot for the taco craving. I'm not talking about the hard shell corn tacos, either. This is the real deal with the super thin doubled-up soft tortillas with a variety of choices to top with. I recommend the pork, and I think I even saw tongue on the menu. Will have to try that next time. Also, they have yucca fries. YUM to yucca always.

Loaded with toppings but not a lot of meat. I can't complain because most of the chips were covered with something. Not to mention they also have a salsa bar!! Second time I came here I got the taco salad with chicken. We ordered our food and sat down. A family of 4 came after us. They got their food before us and I noticed one of them also had a taco salad. My husband got his food served but I still did not. I'm pretty sure my taco salad was served to the other family. We waited and waited and my husband finally had to go up there and ask them were my food was. They made it in a hurry so it was a little sloppy. I didn't mind too much but my husband's food was cold by the time I got mine. Overall, we would visit this place again. The prices are good and that salsa bar is on point.",

I favor the tacos for a yummy yet affordable treat. They have Mexican Coca-cola and Fanta too. Their local brews are a great variety and there margaritas are excellent.

You can perfectly feed 4 people out of if, I'm not kidding. As I got it at my table my first reaction was to get a to go box because there's no way someone can eat all of it.   I got barbacoa with my nachos, and it was juicy and flavorful. Black Brand delicious, and the guacamole topping the plate is unbelievable!

I hadn't set foot inside Sabor before as I'd call in an order & my husband would go pick it up. I'm not going to say the place gets 5 stars in the \"decor category\" as that's not what Sabor is about. It's painted a festive shade of red-orange, is CLEAN and has an open kitchen with a warm, lively & upbeat staff who is clearly happy to be working here and proud of the food they serve! Want to give a \"shout out\" to the delightful Brianna who took our order and to Rich who stood by when I asked to taste the mixer they used for their margaritas (which by the way is made FRESH -- not from a bottle)! The mix tasted great, just as fresh as they promised, so I told Rich who had prepared it earlier that he got an \"A\" for the day and ordered a margarita (the first I've ordered in years)! The entire staff deserved an \"A\"! We left with smiling faces and went home to a  yummy dinner with plenty of leftovers from our generously sized quesadilla & pulled chicken burrito.",

Good service.   I had a taco salad with chicken and it was a good portion and tasty.  My lunch companion had a chicken burrito that could have fed a village.  We were trying to get on line to solve an issue with an app.   When I asked for the wi-if password, I was told that the wi-fi is only for management use.  In 2017, this is just not in keeping with the times.  There needs to be public wi-fi.  That has become the standard and expectation.

The past few times the disorganization and lack of work ethic has resulted in longer wait times and orders just sitting until someone brings them to the table. Sometimes getting cold before they make it to the patron. Tonight was no different. And instead of all hands on deck, there are two workers out having long conversations with the customers while the guys in the back are struggling with filling orders. In fact, one guy took a seat at a table while working and completely disregarded everything but the table in front of him. All while people sat waiting extremely long for their food.  I have begun frequenting this location less due to complete disregard like this. I understand having fun with the customers but letting your coworkers struggle is not something that should take a backseat.",

    "text": "What a great new find to add to our workplace lunch rotation. Especially on Tuesdays for $1 (select) Taco Tuesday!  I had heard about Sabor from coworkers for quite some time. So, after this location near work opened up it was time to check it out. I also have one near my apartment in Fort Mill. hey seem to be popping up all over the CLT area.  A bit hesitant after an aforementioned coworker had a serious issue with a taco on the day they opened, (The management handled the situation with an apology and a refund.) I still went with a group of coworkers the next week. It was definitely a hot spot - especially on Tuesdays - so we knew it had to be good.  For the dollar taco deal you can choose from ground beef, veggie, black bean or shredded chicken. There are other taco options for two and three dollars with steak, etc. I had a coworker get ground beef, shredded chicken and steak and he ended up liking the ground beef and shredded chicken over the steak. [FWIW]  If you order a large queso, guac or pico they'll throw in a basket (more like a lundry basket) of free chippies for the dippies.   Staff is pretty friendly. I did notice on the first visit, the cleaning of tables after people left wasn't happening so some folks had to wipe up their own table. On the second visit, staff seemed to be out and about cleaning up the tables.  Oh yeah .. before I go ... GET THE LOCO STREET CORN! That is all.  adios",

But there are other times, where the steak is rock hard and over cooked or the chicken is hella salty.   The part that drives me crazy is ordering to go. They tell you to sit somewhere and they'll bring it to you. Dope! That sounds great. That's literally as far as it gets though. You just sit there while people who ordered after you get served at their tables. When you get tired of waiting you go up and find your food dying down behind the counter. This is not a one off occurrence, it has happened all three times we ordered to go and it's a heckin bummer man...  I want to like this place. Sometimes I really love this place.

    "text": "I actually like this location floor plan and extremely friendly staff. My family and I live South and usually frequent the Wesley Chapel location. I stumbled across this location while in Pineville getting my jewelry inspected at Jared's. I pulled up my handy dandy Yelp app as I was in a mood for a Black Bean Taco and this place popped up. I had no clue there was a location in Pineville.  The parking lot is sorta confusing as the lines at the entry don't appear to be for parking so I headed past the Sprint store to park properly in lines spaces. I walked back to the restaurant and upon entry I Loved the large open floor plan. As I smiled and looked around and headed to the register I had several voiced say \"Welcome\" and there were two registers with two friendly faces ready to take my order. I ended up with a Black Bean Authentico and a Grilled Veggie Americana Taco. I was pleased and extremely STUFFED after having those two tacos.  I think my super FAV part is the sauce bar and my FAV sauce is The Habenaro :-)   I didn't write my review until after my second visit and this past Tuesday I had a meeting in the area and decided to grab 1 Taco for a snack. However when I walked in it was TACO Tuesday $1 Authentico Tacos = SCORE so I ended up with 3 tacos 1 Black Bean and 2 Grilled Veggie. What threw me off is the fact that the tacos were way smaller than my first visit (5days prior) I brought that to the attention of one of the guys just as an inquiry. I was totally cool if it was due to it being Taco Tuesday & the fact that the tacos were only $1. The guy ensured me that the tacos are always the same size, fortunately for me I ALWAYS take pictures so I happily pulled up the photo from 5 days prior to show him and he was shocked and said that was a fluke. All in all when he brought out my 2nd order, as I was still hungry after the 3 small $1 tacos that I had to go back to order two more, he informed me that he added more to replicate my prior visit and ask to take pictures of the picture I had to show his manager to ensure they deliver.  I appreciated his efforts and acknowledgment of being consistent.",

    "text": "I am SOOO excited that there is a location so close to my house now!!  I work close to the Hawthorne location and always find myself wanting Sabor when I am home!  This location is brand new, so there is a definite newness feel when you visit. Compared to other locations, it is not (yet) packed full of people and the food takes a little longer to come out (I assue this is because they are making food to order).  I could tell that the staff seemed a little overwhelmed, which lead to them being less friendly than they could have been but again, this all comes with the territory of being a brand new restaurant.   The shredded chicken is the best thing you can eat here- in a burrito, in a taco, on nachos- whatever floats your boat.  Their guac is also to die for- it is so creamy and is just perfection. My husband is obsessed with their nachos.  They are GIGANTIC and could probably feed a family of four easily (of course he finishes them off solo). I forsee a TON of visits in our future now that they are so close to home!!!  On a mom note, they have high chairs available and a kids menu that has a fair amount of options compared to other places.  Drink of choice is a smaller fountain drink, so if you need milk for your little one, bring your own.  My toddler was also losing his mind while we were there and they did not bat an eyelash or make us feel unwelcomed :)",

Authentic as always with cilantro and onion, these tacos are spot on. The nachos are the best in the city, not to mention the Arepa!! If you don't know what it is , it's a corn cake stuffed with good things like chicken and crumbled cheese, it's my families favorite thing on the menu.

Sabor offers a pleasant and clean atmosphere but the food could be much better.Before I start talking about whether the food is actually authentic,let's talk about whether it actually tastes good and if it's worth your money.  Again,I really wanted to love this place because I love tacos.Anyway,I've had authentic Mexican food in Mexico and if you know where to look in Charlotte,you'll find authentic Spanish food.Sabor is not the place for authentic Spanish food.The 3 times we visited,we ordered steak and chicken tacos,the protein bowl with ground beef and the gorditas.Each of those dishes was a let down.The meat is VERY dry and lacks flavor.The tortillas were not fully cooked and were still quite stiff.Its also overpriced.Especially considering it doesn't taste good.  As far as how authentic the food is? Not authentic at all.They play Spanish music but that's as authentic as it gets.Seriously,save your money and go to Tacos Nayarit which is a taco truck located behind the golf gas station in Fort Mill.They serve delicious,authentic,quality Spanish food and for a lower price if you can believe it!

Everything was delicious, guacamole was fresh and perfect, portions are huge, the queso wasn't my favorite but that's just a personal preference, I like it spicy.

I'll be honest, I like that they offer it, but they only do a couple of different proteins and limited styles. So even though I'm paying a bit more, I still got the Locos Al Pastor. Pork so good you wouldn't even think it's pork (sorry Pork lovers, I'm usually don't get excited about it). Outstanding fresh toppings piled generously on 2 authentic corn tortillas per taco.  The salsa bar is great as well. I've taken quite a liking to the Pineapple Habanero, but it's just a bit to spicy for me so I cut it with some of the mild salsa. It's been fresh and delightful every visit to Sabor.  Lee served me and Jeremy was behind the line today. Great service, I've been to the Sabor closest to my house and was real disappointed with the crew. Glad that this one really values it's customers.  Next time I'm getting one of those fancy margaritas! They have a selection of mixed drinks on the menu on the side wall so be sure to check it out.  Keep churning out those authentic tacos and I'll be a long-time customer!",

I've had so many versions of empanadas and I admit, I was an empanada snob (sorry) but I admit the first time I came here which was close to the grand opening the recipe used went over board on the cheese. When I came tonight with some friends (they insisted) I was pleasantly surprised.   My fav is the beef but the chicken is a close runner up. I haven't tried the veg but will do so on my next visit.

First of all this one has more seating than the 7th street and NODA location, which I love since that is always a hassle. This location will also handle lines better since the line would be sectioned off unlike the other two I've been to. I had my go to supreme nachos. They made it just as great as the other locations; piled high and beautiful! The service was great ( I believe the manager rang us up and brought us our food, he did a great job) and the food was prepared quickly! They have outlets at the table like the others which I love! All around if you been to other sabors before you will definitely love this one!",

I decided to try the Tacos at this visit and got one of each of the Americanis, Authenticos, and the Locos as well as an empanada. All excellent.   With that said, let's get to the review:  Cleanliness: the eating are was spotless, the tables clean and everything was well maintained Service: everyone was pleasant, clean and friendly. A little sauce leaked onto my empanada, which was fine, but I definitely feel as if I said it wasn't, they would've made me another one.  Food: excellent, fresh, well cooked and packed with flavor, everything that would expect out of Latin food.   Overall: love this place and you should too!  Can't wait to come again.",

Location and bathroom etc is all clean and tidy, the only complaint I have is I'm not a huge fan of their salsas; my meal doesn't come with chips anyway so it's not a big deal, but their salsas aren't for me.

They have 6 or 7 different salsas to pick from. So feel free to try some or all. They have a few outdoor tables with not much a view. Can't have everything I guess.

The food this time however wasn't as good. I decided to order the carne asada fries which I enjoyed the last time I visited. The \"steak\" in this had the same texture of, shape, and size (actually even a bit smaller) as crumbled sausage that you might get on a pizza at little caesars.

Pros: Very clean and friendly staff. Cashier took our order and served us fast. Great atmosphere. Music on point. You don't need to yell!   Cons: we are from Argentina, so definitely, that was not an empanada. At least, Argentinian. It was ok though. But in Argentina we don't mix ground beef with cheese. (For example).  The burrito was ... meh. (Not flavorful, according to my husband). We were expecting some chips, that's why we got some sauces. But the burrito came alone...  My \"carne asada\", well... the steak was over cooked. A stone! So I only ate the cheese guacamole and fries.   Our expectations were higher. But actually we were dissatisfied. So, I think that for the price, I can eat better in another Latin fast food or even a restaurant.  Sorry guys, honestly, I know most of you, will say, I don't care if the \"Argentinian empanadas\" are Argentinian. But I felt disappointed. We left hungry.  So for us, it was just another Latin spot.   It was not the worst but not the best either.",

There's almost NEVER a time you call them to place an order that you don't get a busy signal, or you  get put on hold...where they leave you hanging on and on and on. At least 3 times this last month I gave up holding and decided on another take out option instead. Come on Sabor Pineville. Hire more help if that's what the problem is!! I've almost completely given up on this Sabor.",

Short queue to place my order and I decided to hop around the menu a little.  One empanada with chicken. One \"autentico\" shredded chicken taco. And one fish taco. It did not take long and my food was brought over to the table.  Excellent presentation. The fish taco was a big pile of colorful shredded cabbage on top of tilapia. Very tangy, very tasty. A little messy.  The chicken taco took a little bit of the habanero pineapple salsa (HOT!) and was delicious. A good portion of soft shredded chicken. Quite drippy but delicious.  My final course, I dug into the empanada after it had cooled just a little bit. Nicely stuffed with chicken and cheese, it also came with a creamy sauce for dipping. Delicious.  A large meal, plenty of flavor, good food. Yum!  They also have beer specials which I might have had if I didn't have my \"friend\" with me.",

The tables have charging ports. Novel idea!  There were no forks available so I made the best of it with a spoon. I asked for forks at the counter and the guy went looking but couldnt find any.  The tables were gross and there were chunks of food on the floor in several locations. Just eww. Looks like vomit.  The ladies' restroom was nasty.   The location was not busy on this particular Sunday afternoon so I think they could have at least pushed a broom.  Next time I'll try a different location.",

I liked that they offered both grilled and shredded chicken - not all locations have grilled chicken. My margarita was good. My issue was the small extras. They were out of napkins and salsa cups. Took a LONG time to get my tacos. The grilled chicken was very dry. Other than that it wasn't too bad. It was busy as is normal on Tuesday. There wasn't enough seating - again, normal on a Tuesday. Overall, it's my least favorite location in the chain.",

First time, burrito had under-cooked rice, second time forgot to bring us the drink we ordered, third time the price for the item I ordered was more than the listed menu price. None of the issues by themselves were that serious, but on the other hand each time I brought it to their attention, the staff did not do much to accommodate beyond a simple apology. If more concern for correcting order mistakes and customer satisfaction was shown, I would likely give 5 stars.",

    "text": "Had really high hopes for this place (considering all the other positive reviews). Walked in on a Sunday afternoon with the hubby. We ordered 2 Elote Locos, 1 Stuffed Chicken Arepa and 1 Steak Quesadilla. Here are my thoughts on each: the Elote Locos - Corn had absolutely not flavor (maybe they should add a little salt to the water, that may help a bit), I've had this at other restaurants and it's been amazing but unfortunately here not even the Cotija cheese gave it flavor, quite odd. The arepa - it was ok,  the outside was crispy and tasty, chicken was juicy (but again no flavor) what saves this is the \"rosada\" sauce it comes with, which I assume is simply ketchup/mayo combo. Now on to the Steak Quesadilla, this absolutely has to be the worst I've ever had. It was 2 flour tortillas with some tasteless melted (mozzarella?) cheese and a few tiny flecks of overcooked, dry as hell steak. The fact you charge $7.25 for THAT is absolute highway robbery and what audacity, you have to pay an EXTRA $1.25 to get some peppers and onions added??? Shouldn't the steak be cooked in some peppers, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, etc??? I can't say anything about the rest of the menu items but based on what we ate I'd say I'm never going back. I found these items to be completely bland and tasteless definitely NOT worth the money!",
