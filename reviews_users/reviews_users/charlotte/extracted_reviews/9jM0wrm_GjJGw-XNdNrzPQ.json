    "text": "We moved to the area about a month ago and really wanted to find the best places around town early and get adjusted to everything.  We went to J&H for a late brunch (served until 3 pm!) on a beautiful 78 degree February Sunday.  The theme inside is pretty cool.  Very steampunk and old-timey.  We chose to eat outside since it was such a great day.  Grayson was our waiter and he was very prompt and professional.  My wife had the waffle with a side of potatoes and a Blackberry Bramble to drink because as we know, brunch isn't brunch without vodka.  She enjoyed both food and drink very much.  I had the Brekkie Burger with mushroom risotto.  The burger was awesome.  It has candied bacon, Canadian bacon, provolone cheese and a fried egg on top.  The risotto was prepared as expected and the flavors were perfect.  The location is part of a great collection of spots in downtown Matthews and is about a mile from where we live.  We hope to be back often!",

They were ok. Over thirty minutes after we ordered our food we were still waiting for our main dish.  I went to hostess and asked for bill for chips and soda and explained about having to wait and why we wanted to leave. The right thing to say would have been we are sorry don't worry about check. Instead she got our waitress so that she could give us our check. As this was happening they brought our food out  to the hostess table and offered to wrap it up.Wrong.  We waited too long. We won't be back. I also think they need to reorganize their flow of traffic. Employees were constantly walking in front of hostess area to bring food outside or bring dishes inside.",

    "text": "My husband and I arrived at 5:50pm and were told we had a 40 minute wait.  The bar area was packed so we opted to hang out by the hostess station. The waitstaff  periodically stopped by the crowd standing there and took orders for bar drinks which was nice. When you watch the orders being delivered to the tables, the food looks amazing and has nice portion sizes. People just coming in are now being given a 2 hour wait time and the majority leave. As for us...1 1/2 hours later we were finally seated.  There was no apology or gratitude shown for us sticking it outAfter waiting so long we had lost our appetites. We ordered the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and received about a tablespoon of the cheese sauce to go with 4 pretzels, so we asked for more sauce.  Our waiter told us there'd be an extra charge. What??  Although he did bring an extra portion, we had finished the pretzels already and he said he'd remove the charge when he brought our bill. BTW those pretzels are fantastic!  Hot, buttery and delicious.  But that sauce is just a rumor of a dip.  For my entree I ordered the Irish Farmers salad; not impressed.  It was a mixed lettuce base with chopped boiled egg, cucumber, bacon and seasoned potatoes.  The potatoes were basically cold home fries and the bacon was literally 2 whole slices of undercooked cold strips on top of the salad.  I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts which were just okay.  They had been sauteed (think soft, not crispy) with onions and drizzled with balsamic glaze. My husband ordered a loaded potato and he didn't comment on it. He finished it, so it was apparently okay.  I realize it's a new place and they obviously have a few kinks to work out. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, so we will try it again when the novelty wears off.",

Our server was very nice (a nice change from last time), but my daughter's fries were dropping in grease & barely warm. Then two tries later & the cook still couldn't get my fillet to medium. The hub's \"brekkie burger\" was so dry that once the egg was gone it was pretty much inedible. This place has such potential! A cute name & theme, but EPIC FAIL when it comes to execution. We left wishing we had grabbed nachos from the food truck at Seaboard Taphouse. We won't be giving this a third try...I really wanted to like this place :(",

Maybe I've been watching too much Chef Ramsey, but the appetizer (spinach & artichoke dip) was straight out of the microwave, parts were cold, and other parts hotter than hades! Had the Shepherd's pie... BLAND... and probably came out of the microwave as well ... my wife's plate was pretty bland as well, the chicken risotto. The kids seemed to enjoy the chicken fingers and grilled cheese... but how could they go wrong with that really?!?! Anyways, it's a new place, constantly crowded (who knows why) but it won't be seeing us again. Maybe they should just stick to burgers and fries... I'm sure the rest of the menu is either as bland or overly salted to cover up the blandness! Almost forgot to add, it is LOUD IN HERE... good luck having a conversation without screaming!!!!",

They have live performances like Irish Dancers and music. I'm kind of mixed about it because the dancers mixed around the room in the aisles and it was really neat and entertaining, but it was also pretty loud and hard to have a conversation at the table. So it just depends what kind of experience you're looking for.  They have lots of seating inside and out but it fills up fast during peak hours. Decent draft and drink selection, too.  The service has always been really friendly and attentive. It's a little pricy for casual food, but the food is really good quality and great flavored food.",

Then the manager apologizes but more he justifies it saying the kitchen is slammed and he offers a free dessert for the table. Turns out the dessert is still half frozen Sara Lee cake (don't think this was on the menu).  I was understanding of a large party getting their food in waves but lots of cold food. Also for the price point , one in our party had a very small piece of salmon and a bit of mashed potatoes.   Bottom line we won't be back due to a variety of issues.",

Bad omen was the 4 ladies next to us getting to the bottom of their Irish Nachos to find a black hair. They alerted their server (bartender) who apologized but no manager came by. They told us it was their first time too, sacrificial virgins I assume.  Irish Nachos were just dripping in cheese sauce, sopping - gross. The wings were good, sweet. The spinach and artichoke dip was laughable. A spoonful of dip placed in the middle of a tray of Nachos. We all thought it was a mistake, we asked for more spinach artichoke dip because we had 3000 nachos to go. They brought out a new platter again with just a scoop of dip. We sent it back.   By the time our table was ready we didn't feel that we wanted to eat dinner. The menu wasn't all that enticing.  This is where I come to find out why the restaurant is so aptly named Jekyll & Hyde's. So we ask the bartender (Dr. Jekyll) if we can move ourselves to a booth to enjoy the desserts & He moved us over to an empty booth. Mr. Hyde comes over and says who sat you here!? I replied Dr. Jekyll did and if it's too much trouble we can cash out the bar tab and put our desserts on a new tab with you. Mr. Hyde curtly said that wasn't necessary, never came back to ask us if we wanted more drinks or anything else to order. He next appeared with the warm  bread pudding which had a side of vanilla ice cream. He put down four plates and walked away. I thought he was going to get the other desserts. So almost ten minutes goes by and the gals have shared the the bread pudding, saying it was yummy and still the other 3 desserts have yet to appear. It's 9:30pm, I'm tired and I want to eat and go home. I ask Mr. Hyde where the other desserts are and he mumbles they're coming, very rudely. He mumbled as he walked away so I loudly said, excuse me what did you say? He turned and said spoke to me like a twat \"I said they're being made and when they're ready I will bring them to you\". What??? I replied cancel our order, the girls protested, they wanted their desserts. He ran away quick, I wasn't sure if he was cancelling the desserts or bringing them. Another 10 minutes passed and now I'm just done. I go to the bar, ask Dr. Jekyll for our check and explain to him that we didn't get our other desserts. He was immediately apologetic and said omg wow you ordered those desserts ages ago, I will check on that and make it right. I said no thank you, we were ready to go. He came back to our table just as we saw the desserts coming to the pass. We asked for our checks, paid the tab and gladly gave him 25% gratuity. Leaving the restaurant the hostesses and our Mr. Hyde who was with the hostesses at the pass gave us the side eye and didn't even say goodnight.  Now tell me why me and my lady friends who are choose to patronize a restaurant should be made to feel like jerks when we leave? Why should any server be anything but humble and gracious. We can spend our money anywhere and we will! I don't take kindly to watching three other people share a dessert while all four of us wait for the rest of the food arrives. Don't be rude about it.   I took a look at the Facebook reviews and I have to say that I am really put off by the passive aggressive snarky replys to customer reviews. Ask a manager!? Was there one, I'm not so sure about that. I will have to consult with Gabriel Utterson.",

We had to park in a neighboring building lot and walk over.   Our server, Saundra, was the only saving grace for this experience. My nachos came out cold and 6 minutes before my husband's burger arrived. Now the nachos were super cold - and missing two ingredients. The burger was cooked well instead of medium and was also missing the mayo listed in the menu.   Although our server was hustling and trying to make the best of the kitchen's errors, she couldn't save our bad first impression.   At no point did a manager stop by or did anyone else ask about our experience. We paid our bill in full for the pleasure of cold, incomplete meals.",

Also the price....we had 4 beers (2 cheap beers each) we shared an entree and had a small appetizer and it was in total over $100 with tip...that to me is a little ridiculous!

    "text": "After three attempts at this place, we've given up. The tap list is the only thing that led us to try again, and then one more time. And it's just not worth it. First visit was basic unpleasantness. Dirty counter at the bar. Ignored by the bartender while he talked with a friend - who was sitting right next to me. Eventually given service that seemed an inconvenience to him and bordered on rude. Loved the attempt at calling me by name after we paid, from reading my debit card. But he couldn't even get that right. Wife and I both have extensive food service and hospitality experience. We have standards, but are also very polite and patient. We've been there.  Second try was also at the bar, and little better, from a service perspective. No greeting, no interest in interaction. Many people behind the bar, and none of them so much as looked at us until long after we arrived. Again, we seemed an inconvenience. By this point we had caught on to the very proprietary attitude of the employees. They acted like it was their place, and we were lucky to be there.   Last attempt. It was a nice day, and the patio wasn't at all crowded. Figured a drink outside wouldn't be as irritating as sitting at the bar. Asked at the bar if we would get service outside, and we were told yes. Went to patio to find that most tables had a reserved sign, but sat at one of two that didn't. Waited. Waited. Finally greeted by \"you can't sit here, this table is reserved.\" No greeting, no apology. After pointing out that there wasn't a sign saying so, we were directed to sit on the (very dirty) couches in the corner. So we did, but the server didn't follow us over. Waited some more. Finally gave up and asked for a manager. Of course he was all apologies, even offered us dinner on the house. Asked if there was anything he could do to regain our business and I'll end this review with our answer. \"No.\"",

    "text": "Brand new so there are going to be some kinks to work out but overall this place has lot of potential. There is a decent sized patio with tables that will be really nice when the weather improves.   Four of us decided to give this place a try, went in around 6:30 on Sunday and had about a 10 minute wait. The waiter said they were slammed over the weekend so they were out of a few wines, no big deal.   3 of us started out with the French Onion soup. It wasn't bad but not great either. Hardly any broth and it was served luke warm at best.   One had a burger & fries which he said was really good. The bangers and mash were excellent. Two had salads which were pretty much just all lettuce and not much of anything else.   Overall not bad for being open less than a week. I'm sure I'll be back and would recommend giving it a try.",

My husband had the beer battered fried shrimp which was delicious. I ended up eating half of his because my order came out wrong. I ordered the filet flatbread with no mushrooms. Sure enough it came out with mushrooms. Sent it back and when it car back out it was missing not only the mushrooms but also the banana peppers. I asked the server for a side of them because I hated to send it back again. It was so soggy on the bottom it was literally dripping when I picked up a slice to eat. Needless to say I didn't eat it. We let our server know and nothing was done. Not sure if I would return or not. Not a great first time experience.",

We live right around the corner and I guess I am a glutton for punishment because I have high hopes every time I come here but something always comes up.  It is a cool concept and the menu looks good.  Today we made a \"reservation\" at 2 PM and finally got seated at 240ish.  13 minutes to see a waiter, and another 10 to get drinks.....I have high hopes for the time it takes to get the food as we still sit here waiting.  We would have had the same service just walking in anywhere else for brunch for Mother's day.  They seated a big party right before we got here and they appeared to be walk ins.  They kept open a prime table for a group that sat there for over an hour after finishing their meal because they were there to see one of the servers....great to have the family atmosphere but not a good idea while you have a big crowd for brunch.  Currently they had to go to the store for eggs and champagne, and they can't make anything with tonic.  On other occasions here they served my kids either buttermilk or expired milk because it was sour and we threw it out, burnt the veggie burger because I'm not sure the cook understood it wouldn't brown like meat, and the very first time we came I saw someone in their open kitchen open a package with his teeth.  The portion sizes are not consistent, especially when you do take out.  But hey, the waiter was nice....and the only one who apologized for anything.  Guess I will just keep rolling the dice when I come here.  Drinks and apps are good but meals are going to be a surprise.",

We were sat quickly because it seemed we got there before the \"rush\" of the dinner crowd. Our waitress was nice and brought us waters almost immediately and explained their drink menu which looks amazing but this is the downfall. I understand cocktails can take a minute to make and I dont know if there's only 1 bartender for the entire restaurant but it's pretty bad when you have to put a disclaimer at the bottom of your menu explaining that it could take at least 10 minutes to make your drink.. I noticed this after we had ordered one. So therefore that disclaimer is correct and it must have been 10 minutes PER cocktail because we got my husbands drink and then mine a couple of minutes later after they had to remake it because someone had taken it for another table. Needless to say we're disappointed and we won't be back for awhile.",

I can eat anything usually love it, the chicken on this salad was literally like chewing on rubber. It was not tasty rubbery either. Because it is a cool environment, I will try it again. But only one more time and then decide if it will be a regular for us. A bit pricey as well, dinner was around 70 with a few IPA's.",

I ordered the caprese salad and my husband ordered a burger. 2 burgers were brought to the table, I then explained I ordered a salad. While waiting on my salad to come out after approximately 10 min, I read reviews on yelp and was disgusted by how the owner responds to reviews, It was so extremely rude to the point where I could not stand to support a restaurant that has an owner speak to customers that way. We left shortly after. Overall, server was great, but hoping for a better experience if we go back.",

Their drink menu is fab. I tried a couple of their cocktails and they were super strong but definitely great. So here comes the not so good part. My husband and I ate there for dinner and it was a total disaster.  We ordered burgers and I had a side of onion rings and my husband a side of fries. I ordered the jalapeno burger. When my burger came out, no jalapenos on it. I thought maybe they were cooked into the burger. I had also asked for bacon on my burger but none in sight. I asked the waitress (who was awful) for the bacon and she never returned with it. My husband was eating his burger and immediately was pulling hair out of his mouth. A few short hairs were embedded in his burger. It was disgusting. We called the waitress over and her first response was \"I hope you're kidding\". He showed her the hairs. She takes our food and goes away and comes back telling us the manager will come out to see us. 15 minutes go by and no manager and no food. She comes back over to refill drinks and informs us the food is almost ready. I asked where the manager was and she said he was busy and would be over soon. Really? He should have been over as soon as it happened. She returned with new food and this time there was jalapenos on my burger but still no bacon. The manager came out and said he has no idea how hair would get in the burger as everyone wears hair nets. Ok whatever. He was apologetic and tried to put the blame on the fact that they had temps in the kitchen, but I don't buy it.  He comped us the meals which was nice and very much appreciated.  I will give this place the benefit of the doubt and go back and write another review. I want them to do well. We have been back a few times but only for drinks.",

    "text": "My wife and I came in on a rainy early evening, we've got a pair of twins we wanted to get a few hours away from so we strolled into this joint eager to check out the ambiance and enjoy a good meal.    When you walk in the door, the Victorian/Steam punk decor is really impressive.  The overhead lighting flickers and wall paper transport you to another world. The wait staff are dressed in period garb, men in dark trousers, grey shirts and suspenders, the women all dressed in bustiers.  You begin to feel that you in a Disney version of 19th century Londonpub, but then you sit your rear down in a cheap uncomfortable plastic seat, and your handed the stickiest flimsy menu and all that magic is sucked away.  You can see into the brightly lit kitchen and wonder to yourself, why, this was almost so magical, who needs to see the bright white sanitation of a kitchen in a 19th century Victorian odyssey.  Their drink menu is jam packed with deliciousness, but is poorly labeled.  For the typical Charlotte beer snob they have a wide variety of beers, but they don't give you the type or description and if you haven't memorized our 20 some odd beers and breweries you're up the creek.  Ask the waiter, he isn't really a beer guy, but he heard that the NODA is good.  Thanks pal.  Well, if you're looking for good food, strap yourself in because most of it was pretty mind-blowing.  My wife is addicted to fried pickles, so we ordered them.  I was disappointed, they gave you a tiny bit of ranch dressing, which I wanted to drown my pickle in because I wasn't thrilled with the pickles.  The sticky menu had one thing right they label their signature dishes, and with good cause.  I ordered the French Onion Soup, which with Trump being president, are we going to start saying Freedom Soup again?  The French Onion Soup must have made a mess when I took a sip and it blew my mind, because at that time a child started screaming for his life.  I am not sure why a 2 yr old is out at 6pm, olde boy needs to be home, getting a bath before hitting the pillow at 6:30.  You know what kids are out past 6:30, bad kids, kids who don't recycle, kids who don't act well in public.  Kids who's parents just want to enjoy their friends and relive their old life, but Dad has to take their screaming son outside and console him softly by the dumpster begging him to calm down so he can get back to his sandwich before it gets cold and that son of a gun, Todd eats all his fries.  The soup was delicious and unique, you could tell a lot of care goes into their food.    My wife ordered the Spinach flatbred, which tasted like a flat piece of paper with artichoke dip on it.  I don't remember if there was a spinach and artichoke dip on the menu, if there was I bet its awesome, because outside that piece of paper, it was good.  My wife only ate half, while she chewed on resentment because she asked me if she should get the artichoke flatbread or the pulled pork bbq flatbread.  Guess which I chose.  So sticking with their signature item branding on the menu I choses the Shepard's Pie.  And like the Shepards at the nativity, I've seen the Lord.  It was hands down the best Shepard Pie, I have ever had.  And my Mom used to make Shepard's pie and she'll read this review.  Will she still love me, I bet she will.  It was just perfect, not slapped together and a scoop of Mashed taters tossed on it.    Since it was my birthday, my wife suggested we get desert.  But since its my birthday, she let me choose, I really wanted her to choose, but you don't get your wishes on your birthday apparently.  I went with the signature, shocker right, Bread Pudding.  My wife never knew what bread pudding was, I am not sure she knew what to expect, but it was great.    The food is equivalent to some of the best Irish Pub Food I've ever had, and I'll definitely be back.  I hope this place does well, reads this review and uses the cash they make to buy better menus and improve the furniture.  Also hide the kitchen in shame, it takes away from the time travelling voyage I want to be on for the only 2 hours away from my kids I'll get this month.",

I finished my Shepard's Pie before my boyfriend even finished his fries from the Fish and Chips! $15 and it took me only a couple of bites to finish it- felt like such a waste for the price. The last time I had the Shepard's Pie it came in a different bowl and I was so full I couldn't even finish it! This time I felt like I was eating a kids meal sized version. I'm not sure why they changed the serving size but it made me feel like a real fool. Come starving, leave hungry.",

We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which tasted a lot like the frozen TGI Friday's appetizer you can buy at the grocery store. My husband ordered the brekkie burger and was brought out the black and blue burger. Our waitress didn't stop by our table for about 10 minutes after we got our food to check on it... by that point my husband decided to just eat it as we had our fussy 1 year old with us. I ordered the salad with dried cranberries and grilled chicken. It was super sweet, I thought it came with blue cheese on it but there was none... too bad, the cheese would have helped! The salad was pretty warm but other than being sweet it tasted good. Our daughter had the kids mac and cheese which was just plain old kraft mac and cheese. Her side was applesauce in a plastic cup that they just peeled the foil lid off of. Overall for the price we paid it just seemed like cheap and poorly executed food. Our waitress was nice and kept up with refills, but it was her job to make sure we got the right food. I don't think we'll be back. There are much better options in Matthews!",

When I said something the server said he didn't think we had waited that long.   We had to ask for plates for our appetizers and those came after we finished and only 2 plates when there were four of us.   Only one of our group was asked if he'd like a refill. I had to ask for more water.   We were there for over 90 minutes and saw our waiter about 4 times.",

We found two seats at the community table in the bar. Chris P. gave us menus almost immediately and our drink orders were taken. She was friendly and efficient, checking on us several times throughout our meal. Definitely enjoyed the atmosphere in the bar area. My dinner partner and I different entree. Mine was the Shrimp Thai salad and I was very pleased with my choice. It was very flavorful and the portion of jumbo shrimp was generous. I definitely would like to go back to check out the lunch fare.",

    "text": "This is the new hot spot to be in Matthews. They absolutely need seats for people waiting on a table especially since the wait is upwards of an hour. I do not like the way they laid the restaurant out there are people trying to serve trays of food while people are squeezing by to get to their table.  The bar is way in the back of the restaurant and again very hard to get too and once you get there they have tables crammed up so close to it you barely have any room to stand and get a drink. It took us a good 10 minutes to  be able to order. Then to find a place to wait on your table again back through the cramped and crowded restaurant to the front where you can either stand in the door area or on the sidewalk not really ideal. After we got seated, we chose outside as it was a beautiful night our waiter came to take our drink order and ask if we wanted an appetizer we ordered the pretzel sticks with \"Warm Bavarian pretzel sticks sprinkled with sea salt served w/ house made mustard sauce\". He brought our drinks and took our order after about 20 minutes we still had not received our appetizer he came to tell us sorry the kitchen is really backed up and it would take longer than usual to get our food. The Pretzel arrived and they were Delicious the sauce they serve them with is amazing,  we eventually got our dinner, I had the beer battered chicken with Mac and cheese, which is not at all your normal mac and cheese it has more of an Alfredo sauce and bacon, it was luscious and the chicken was good as well. My niece had the black bean burger and salad and she said they were delectable. The manager came by everyone's table to check on things which was nice. Overall the restaurant layout is lacking, but the food is pretty darn tasty, but you may have to wait a while to get it.",

    "text": "Went last night (Thursday) around 7pm with my friend for a few drinks. It was pretty slammed - especially in the main dining area. The place is very new, so everything was nice, clean, fresh looking. Very good lighting and ambiance. Welcoming. It was busy so it wasn't the easiest to navigate around people but no biggie.   The bar area is pretty cool with seats at the bar, some smaller tables, and a few long, \"family-style\" tables as well. I like that. People really seemed to be enjoying themselves. I was hoping to sit outside because there is an awesome high-top table with a gas fire pit-thingy built in the middle that looked cool. But we bellied up to the bar instead.   The bartenders were pretty slammed but were super friendly and we didn't have to wait long to get waited on. They have an entire wall of taps/draft beers and even have a TV (one of 7-8 huge, HD ones) always dedicated to showing updates menu options, even showing all the beers broken down by type! (LOVE that). We tried at least 5 different beers. We really hated one and the bartender didn't even quibble - just took it away and replaced it with a different one. Beautiful. That is how service should be. We also ate a little - I got the Pretzel sticks and cheese dip (YES - MUST try) and my friend sit the Steak Fries (very good and filled us up).   Overall - I was very impressed and cannot wait to come back to eat a full meal in the main dining area.",

    "text": "Had a great dinner there a few days ago. We just moved to Matthews and have been exploring all the local spots. I Had to leave a review cause when we arrived, we heard two ladies complaining and even went as far as yelling something about their burger as the door was closing. Even if they had something wrong, I think doing that is immature and rude to other guests trying to enjoy their meals or just coming in to get seated. Especially since the gentlemen they were talking to was nothing but apologetic and kind. I can only really guess that they were just being that level of extra. Anyhoo about the review... We had the nachos to share, I ate the sirloin, my dad had the shepherds pie( which he absolutely loved and cleaned the bowl), and my husband had the signature burger (forget the name).  Everything was hot, delicious, and our service was great. We had some craft beers and drinks and everything came out quickly. If I had only one negative thing to write is that the space was tight so kind of hard to get into the booth. But mainly because a large party was taking up the table next to us. Also the server forgot our mushy peas for my daughter, but she fell asleep anyways and he didn't charge us so it actually worked out for the better.  My advice... give it a try... it is a little pricey for pub food but it tastes great and loved the atmosphere. So cheers!",

Servers doing side work between shifts or at the end of the night so they can leave, hostess has been sent home, cooks are breaking things down and starting to clean. People are off their game. We arrived at 9:45pm and they are open until midnight. Saturday night. No one at the front to greet us. A Server walking by stopped and actually sat us. This was disappointing. Hadn't been back in a year due to a bad food experience. Wanted to give it another try. Not much has changed. This place has a good vibe at the bar but the food wasn't good this trip either. Steak unseasoned, chicken tenders over cooked and way too salty. Irish nachos burnt flavor. Mac and cheese was decent. Manager was professional and apologetic.

The risotto chicken dish was nothing more than dry, overcooked rice (not made to order) with undercooked mushrooms, and overcooked dry chicken breast on the top. The dish had a strange sweet balsamic glaze all over the plate which didn't pair with the rest of the meal.  The fish and chips, also ordered at our table were pretty good.

The food is good, for the most part (let's face it, every restaurant has an off night or two) but the prices are what keep me from fully loving it. It's just not worth the price. The sides for the sandwiches aren't great at all. Don't get the risotto. I've tried it more than once and it's always crunchy.  A couple of times with the chicken caprese sandwich, the chicken was so small I pulled half the bun off because the chicken wasn't big enough to cover the bun. Skip  the burgers, they don't have a lot of flavor & are thin.  The pretzels, French onion soup &  the fish & chips are all good - fish has a good flavor. It's really a hit or miss kind of place. If they lowered their prices, it would be much more worth it.",

The food is mediocre at best; and that's being nice my salad was inedible the meat was tasteless unless you count that it tasted off. My children wouldn't even eat their Mac and cheese, or cheese pizza (which are nearly impossible to mess up) The staff was friendly and prompt. In fact the staff was so nice I have a certain amount of guilt writing this review. It would be a really neat place IF the food was good. They need to put a lot of effort into the quality of the food and improved taste or I see this as another cool idea littered on the highway of broken dreams like so many other restaurants who focused more on the visual experience rather then the food.

It's very hip and the wait staff dresses in a \"moulin rouge\" theme attire.   The fare is mainly \"English Pub\" oriented, but it's a very diverse menu, if not in the mood for Fish and Chips or Sheppard's Pie.    Personally the two items I've tried that I was very pleased with was: 1.  The Pork Flatbread: (All natural local pork tossed in Mississippi cattle bbq, candied onions, smoked cheddar topped with jalapeno ranch sauce and green onions.) Very tasty and light....very good for a small lunch.  2.  The Chicken Sandwich that is on their special lunch menu (They do a lunch menu with smaller portions and non regular menu items.  They have a good variety of draft beer and cocktails.  They have a separate bar in an indoor patio, which is perfect for a date or drinks/apps with friends.    I haven't tried it yet, but they do serve Brunch on the Weekends from 11am-3pm.   Give it a try!",

The steak was super fatty and gave the dish a super weird flavor.   I literally picked every steak piece out and set it to the side.   The mashed potatoes and the peas and carrots were OK.  While I love the decor inside.....the last 2 times Ive been....the food has just been so so.   I doubt I will come back simply because I dont think the food is that great.",

Received a giant bowl containing a dab of mashed potatoes and gravy with 2 over cooked bratwurst-tasting sausages.  I'm not Irish, I've never had \"bangers and mash\", but....for $14 I was hoping it would somehow taste decidedly foreign.....better than boring sausages plopped on a small patch of mashed potatoes and gravy.  Nope.  I could replicate this at home for 1/2 the price and make it taste 10x better.  Meh.  My girlfriend got the shepherds pie.  It tasted okay, the meat was very tender.  Overall it could have had a bit more saltiness but it was decent.  I think this place is just overpriced comfort food with a novel atmosphere...but.....in Matthews at 9pm you cant be THAT picky.  I'd be willing to try this place one more time, possibly the fish and chips or a burger.  The waiter (Thomas) was cool, very personable.  A++ for him",

This spot is a good one and one that I'm going to recommend the next time I have a Matthews day/night out with my friends who live out in this direction.   The actual building is great. So many new restaurants are cold and generic. This building separates the bar from the restaurant, which enhances the experience in both areas. The interior design is warm and welcoming, again rare for a new building.   The beer selection is top-notch. It's great that Charlotte is moving in a direction where this is the norm. They do a great job mixing in local breweries with national and international selections.  The staff is professional and very attentive, even when it gets busy, like it did today. The manager was very attentive.   This place is great and I'm definitely going to be back whenever I am in the Matthews area.",

That would have been a three-star review but today I got a yearning for French onion soup and seeing the positive reviews I decided to try theirs. Don't. FRENCH onion soup is made with Sherry or Port wine, is sweet and that's what I expected. Instead, the onion soup here is made with Guinness and is quite bitter, so the exact opposite. The soup bowl was quite shallow for an onion soup but this I didn't care since I didn't finish it anyway. Plus the waitress was kind of hopeless which didn't make the experience any better.",

The wait staff (Amanda) is wonderful - first off.  However, I ordered the seared tuna filet with double kale as a side.  What I received was a bowl of sesame dressing with a side of kale and tuna. Instead of a filet of tuna, they topped the kale with bits of tuna.... which means the amount of tuna was  far less than what it would have been for the filet, hence the reason why I don't order salads anywhere. In the end, I just stopped eating because they just doused it all with sauce.   On happy note- build your own Bloody Mary are amazing- So are the mimosas! A tad expensive though, I wish they were bottomless.  Again, staff was amazing and gave water bowls to our pups.   Amanda was very apologetic for my meal- so she tried to take ownership, which I appreciate greatly. She was a highlight of the meal since she was awesome to us and our pups.",

I talked some friends (who have never been there) in to going to dinner there and I ended up being so embarrassed. The food was TERRIBLE- we ordered pretzels (those were decent although the cheese was a bit crusty) and the beyond burger which was good the Brussel sprouts were very hard but the taste was decent. Our friends however totally striked out- the fried pickles were unbelievably salty, unbearable greasy and about 90% batter. They also got the French onion soup and couldn't cut the bread without a fork and knife it was so hard. Their main meal came out as Shepard's pie, the cheese wasn't even melted and at this point they were so turned off that they barely even ate it. My friends were so embarrassed and upset because they already complained about pickles so I decided to take managers into my own hand and go talk to the manager and she did not care ONE BIT but proceeded to tell me \"we sell 10lbs of pickles a week.\" She was so rude and didn't seem to care about our experience whatsoever. We come here with work A LOT but this will now be on the \"do not go to\" list.",

They offer a veggie burger that is advertised as plant-based. It is a Beyond Meat Burger and was very good.  I paired it with the Saratoga Chips which are excellent. They also offer broccoli and Brussels sprouts which are vegan. They are cooked with a little oil but no animal fat. I am thrilled to have another restaurant option in Matthews. Service was good. The hostess was very helpful with getting answers to my vegan questions.   I would love to see this place expand it's vegan offerings such as non-dairy cheese for the flatbreads.

    "text": "We decided to check out Jekyll & Hyde for dinner on a rainy Thursday evening.  The restaurant was busy with almost every table full, but we were seated immediately.  We were brought past the booths and tables to a high-top table by the windows, which was absolutely perfect because I like sitting up high and having a window view.  A small band (2 guys) were playing live music a couple of tables down from us.  It was pretty loud at first being so close, but we grew accustomed to it.    The interior of the restaurant was pretty cool and modern.  It had a steampunk vibe to it.    The menu is a good size.  There are a lot of varied offerings (apps, salads, sandwiches, entrees, steaks) without being overwhelming.  The menu items also have an English influence to them, while still being mostly American.  I ordered the jalapeno burger.  There are many unique sides to choose from that you don't find at other restaurants.  Besides the regulars (fries, baked potato, mashed potato, mixed veggie), there's also such fare as mushroom risotto, brussel sprouts, and mushy peas.  To balance the burger, I went with the garden salad, which turned out to be pretty big for a side salad.  The burger was awesome -- cooked just right, juicy, and flavorful.  Out the window, I could see Wayback Burgers down the street and thought how we once paid almost as much for average overpriced \"fast food\" burgers there as these delicious, fresh ones at Jekyll & Hyde.  The restaurant also had a better-than-most beer selection on tap.  I'm no beer connoisseur (light and/or fruity for me, please), but I like to venture out and try local beers from time to time.  This time was a Wicked Week Lunatic Blonde because...why not?  It was cold and refreshing, served in a Jekyll & Hyde branded pint glass.    Service, food, and atmosphere was fantastic, so we'll be back, adding Jekyll & Hyde to our regular rotation of affordable, casual nearby restaurants.",

Prices are decent, the place has a great ambiance, and the menu is diverse. I'll be back again!",

They put ice in a back and beat it will a mallet then pours it in a glass. Why not just have smaller ice. All the burning of the orange slice burning is ridiculous. She finally asked what we wanted. She looked at though we had inconvenienced her. Order some drinks. Way over priced. Ordered some appetizers. Not bad. Really can't screw up pretzels and chips. We ordered dinner. My husband got bangers and mash. He said it was good. I got the ooey gooey grilled cheese. It was burnt. I couldn't get the bartenders attention to send it back. I ate around the burnt part. I'm sure it would have been good if it weren't burnt. Our bill came and man let me tell you, they are way too expensive. I doubt we will be back.",

The Pie was subpar, cooked with what looked like frozen peas and carrots, the meat didn't taste fresh either; I was highly disappointed. My wife's alfredo was excellent although the portion was on the smaller side, if you're really hungry I wouldn't recommend it.

Food slides everywhere and if you're sitting outside, it goes through the holes in the table.  The waiter even dropped a small piece on me when he went to take our plates because it fell through the table. -I like to order my burgers well done.  These were beyond well done.  They were completely burnt.  It was basically inedible.  I couldn't taste anything else that was on the burger.   -The fries that came with it were basically frozen steak fries, like something I would throw in the oven at home. -If you're thinking, \"Well I'll just get mashed potatoes instead of fries,\" think again.  My friend got the mashed potatoes with her well done burger (also inedible), and they were basically a baked potato that had been smashed.  She picked up one lump with her fork that was probably a couple inches in diameter.",

I'm still fairly new to the area but passing through matthews and seeing this place is a pretty good look. The service was great, everyone seemed pleasant and helpful. Now on to the important part, typically I don't order chicken breast sandwiches at restaurants due to the lack of flavor or the chicken being dry. I ordered the chicken caprese with steak fries, this was neither of those. It was flavorful and juicy. To say, at first it did not come out hot  (which hot food is a necessity especially with fries)but explaining to the waitress she quickly rectified the situation and served me a fresh and hot plate. My friend ordered the cheeseburger and mashed potatoes. Needless to say, he ate the entire thing. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will be visiting again soon.",

I didn't expect to be told that what I ordered had been 86'd when the rest of our table was being served their entrees, but it was opening night. Tonight we arrived at 7:30 and sat at 7:40. It was crowded but not crazy crowded. Our server was great, we ordered 2 apps and meals for 5 of us at 8:00. After 10 minutes our server told us the kitchen was backed up and food would be a bit longer. We had no issues with this as we were having a good time. At 9:00 our entrees were served. The apps never arrived. The burger was good although not cooked to temp ordered, but it was still good. I so want to give his place a 5 star as I love the inside and servers have been great. Unfortunately, the kitchen needs a lot of work and there needs to be some hands on management.  It's usually not difficult to pick out the managers, but I didn't see any management on the floor talking to tables. The servers were left on their own. If this place doesn't figure out the kitchen and parts of the front of the house it won't be around long. The servers are the main reason for 3 stars.",

The reason I gave the place 3 stars was the food. It really deserved a 4 star rating on the food alone. The Salmon dish was cooked to perfection and full of flavor with a sweet Guinness sauce on it laying on a bed of mashed potatoes and asparagus. The creme brulee cheesecake was magnificent. We tried several of the cocktails and I highly recommend the Blackberry Bramble.",

I came here for a wedding after party and had a really great time. We had most of the patio and a large table reserved. There was a large dining area around the corner from where we were, so there will likely always be space for you here. The bar staff was super accommodating to our large party and made sure we had everything we needed. They even gave the happy couple glasses of champagne on the house.   Since it was a Wednesday, I took advantage of the happy hour deal and got a half prices bottle of wine to share with my sister.  Mega win! There was also a wide variety of local beers on tap, along with bartenders ready to whip up any drink you would like. Me and my sister also shared a plate of Irish nachos which were potato slices covered in cheese, bacon, green onions, and tomatoes. There were the perfect thing to much on while enjoying drinks. Overall I think Jekyll & Hyde is a great place to grab a drink with friends.",

We washed those down with some local beers from Lenny boy, D9 brewing and an amazing blonde stout from Legal remedy. Can't wait to return and try more food!",

I guess I just had the wrong expectation or maybe the night crowd is more festive (we were there around 530), but some people told me it was a steampunk concept, so I was excited to see it.  Walking into the restaurant I just got the impression of a lot of wood.  We walked around towards the back of the restaurant to the bar area and just more wood.  To me, steampunk is lots of refined metal work, gearings and mechanisms and that Victorian sense of fabric and wardrobe...but the bartenders just had suspenders; no flair of steampunk for sure.  The food...meh.  Some interesting mixed drinks.  I probably won't go again.",

Lastly, we enjoyed a piece of the chocolate cake, which was some of the best we have ever had.

My egg on top needed a little longer to be cooked and I didn't quite taste how the bacon was candied. It just tasted like smoked bacon.

Even with our reservation we were told their would be a wait unless we opted to sit outside. With the weather, we were hesitant but decided to chance it. Luckily no rain came our way! There were some glitches along the way such as running out of food items and silverware. But, I judge based on service and taste! I've worked in the restaurant business before, for several years, so I know IT HAPPENS!! But our waitress was the sweetest! I could tell she was overwhelmed and upset but she held herself very well. Even with those issues, she still smiled and acknowledged the situation. The food was delicious! I was surprised at how well it was presented with how busy they were. I feel like a lot of people go out thinking everything has to run perfectly and smoothly. Those people HAVE NEVER worked in food service obviously. Even the best planning, things happen. This place is a small Taphouse.....and it WAS PACKED! These employees tried their best to keep up and never gave up. There was 1 girl with brown hair and a romper on that had a horrible attitude but I didn't let 1 bad egg ruin the day when I saw 10 others giving it their ALL. Especially our waitress Livi....that girl rocked it out and did her very best. My boyfriend and I both agreed we would be back! We look forward to visiting on a less busy day to take in the full atmosphere this place has to offer.   Thank you all for working so hard on Mother's Day....taking time away from your children, mothers and grandmothers to serve us!!!",

While waiting for my friend, I ordered a mixed drink. The drink was obviously weak and hard to accept at $7.00. After my friend arrived, I mentioned to the server that the drink was weak and the second drink was much better.   Service was slow, and felt like our server was lethargic. Only dealt with him 2 times. Other staff brought drinks and food. My Salmon dish arrived without the Kale Salad.   When several minutes later my salad arrived I couldn't believe how small the portion was. It was served in a small container made for serving condiments. Literally two small bites.   The food was good but when looking at the price, service, and atmosphere I don't think it's currently a good value.",

Service level doesn't get any better,  decide to call it a night, get our check/pay and move on.  Next morning, review my bill and notice a $2 discrepancy vs the subtotal after adding each individual item.  After a couple of calls to the manager, turns out they were charging additional $2 on \"beer flights\" due to cost of premium beers....I've ordered a lot of flights and this is a first.

By the time it got to us the fries weren't even hot-we sent it back and they burned it and returned it and the server was not very apologetic or even remotely concerned with the quality of our meal. The times before this were good but I feel like we haven't come back as often since.",

Hard to hear for normal conversation.  Food is just ok.  I had the fish and chips the other night.  It's looks like Mrs Paul's fish right of of the box...and for $16 I expect better.  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was really dry, very disappointing.  Also, I have ordered the flatbread several times and it comes out differently each time, no consistency.  Service was not very good Friday either.  I ordered a tap beer of the menu and the waiter tells me they don't have it.  I'm thinking he means they are out, not he says they don't offer it.  I show him the menu and he says huh, maybe they do.  He doesn't check to see how the food is and the bill comes as just a total, no itemized bill.  I'm crossing it off my list as a regular place to go.",

We went on a Friday night and the place was packed. The hour long wait turned out to only be about half that. I understand orders sometimes go wrong, but they missed on both my wife's and mine. My burger, ordered medium rare, was delivered well done and my wife's did not have the sauce on the side as requested, so the rest of us were left to eat while it took 10 minutes to redo. Other than the server bringing a beer over and offering it to me (it wasn't what I was drinking plus I was driving - in fact, I'm pretty sure it was one they had poured by mistake anyway), no effort or comment was made. I'm guessing with all the options in the are we won't be back.",

It was a beautiful day and we chose to eat outside.  My husband discovered too late that his chair had ketchup on it.  When our food arrived my husband's hamburger was missing the very clearly ordered lettuce, tomato and onions.  I ordered the kale salad.  I had enjoyed the kale salad on my first visit and wanted it again.   There was one problem, the main ingredient was not kale.   A few kale leaves were sprinkled on top but that was it.   On my first visit the lettuce used was kale.  I did tell the server because I thought I had been given the wrong salad.  I was given a lame excuse that it depends who is working in the kitchen as to how the food is made.  I do not own a restaurant but I do know that if you have a kale salad, kale should be the main ingredient.   This was a much cheaper version of the salad I received on my first visit.  The server did bring out more kale.  Unfortunately, I will think twice about returning in the future.",

They didn't and served it to my mom. Thankfully she caught as she was removing her tomato from the burger. After I let the waitress know. The manager came to apologize and tell us that it happens!! IT HAPPENS!! She proceeded to say that they are working on a new order for my mother. I guess it was only for the burger because they just put the previous fries on a new plate and still served it to my mother. Needless to say that if my mother would have been bit into that burger without moving the tomato then we would be in the hospital right now. When I approached the manager regarding this (brunette, skinny, middle aged), she said \"well nothing happened\"!!! That was her response!! Ofcourse , she said we make sure this wouldn't happen again but that response was rude, inconsiderate and absolutely unacceptable! I will not return to this place unless it's under new management. They lost a very loyal customer. I usually go there during my lunch hours as I have done today. But this is the last time!",

My neighbors and I were excited to hear about a new place coming to the neighborhood and planned a get together this evening.  In preparation we called early to reserve a table and were told that no reservations were taken.  Fair enough.... we showed up at 7pm to see several high tops available for our party of 7 but were told that there was a two hour wait... huh?! So we saw a group get up and asked if it was available and a server told us yes... as soon as we sit down, we are told to get up because the table is reserved.... so confusing! and again, I thought you didn't take reservations... I really try to be fair in reviews that I post and this one is necessary.  As a local resident who was excited to see a new business coming to the area, I would expect to be treated fairly.  This whole \"we don't take reservations but have several 'reserved' tables\" attitude and approach is just so unnecessary for Matthews.  I'm disappointed",

If this is some kind of twisted sobriety test, the humor was lost on me and I know I'm not the only one to be befuddled by this.    One more thing. A respectable brew pub these days imo should have at least one double IPA or equivalently strong brew on tap.  When I inquired after such, I was informed I was not the first to be disappointed at the lack of this.    Still and all, great potential in the quaint downtown.  Might try it again when next in town.",

I like the menu and 50 craft beers on tap is terrific.  However, this may be the loudest restaurant I have even been in which made conversation with our friends a challenge, and that is why we went out to dinner together.  There is a menu item for a 1/2 rack of ribs, and in the description it offers a full rack for $4.99 more.  I ordered \"the ribs\", and ended up with the full rack.  Maybe our waitress thought if she bumped up the check it would bump up her tip, or maybe it was so loud she couldn't hear me.  Either way I did not appreciate it.  We did not often see our waitress, but the bus boy did offer to clear my plate half-way through my meal.  I guess the bottom line is this is a nice addition to Matthews, and I hope they are successful.  They have only been open a few weeks, so maybe some of the staff issues will shake themselves out.  I am not sure what they can do about the noise level.  Sitting outside may help when the weather is nice.",

The only thing is that if you plan to go during the weekend, plan for it to be pretty packed at the bar area.

Not enough flavor. My husband loved his and the mac and cheese. To me the Noodles in the Mac and cheese were a little over cooked, but being a new restaurant I'm sure they will get it on point!   Lastly we had the bread pudding! It was huge. The ice cream was so delicious. The bread pudding could use more flavor though. The general manager came around and asked me my option about the bread pudding. He was telling me they feel like they needed to add more flavor as well. We discussed the idea of how to make it amazing, by adding raisins and caramel sauce. I can't wait to go back and try it when they have adjusted the recipe!!",

The steak sandwich is open face and very tasty, they actually cook to your liking and get it exact. I had a side salad(which was huge) and blue cheese dressing that appeared to be house made. The potato soup is very rich and extremely thick, enough for two to share. The fish and chips rock, very light cod with great tasting batter. Our server Tom was very helpful and attentive throughout our meal. I would highly recommend the cocktails made by Pete behind the bar, he is an awesome mixologist. I will be back for sure and can't wait to have others try this place out.",

They were ok, except it is a puny portion compared to the price.  The fish wasn't too bad, but I wish there had been a bigger portion. The waitress said the chips were fried and crispy, so I substituted a salad... It was basic. Finally, the mushy peas were nothing more than peas, a big disappointment compared to my dish when I was in London.  A hamburger ordered medium was more like well done. Not juicy and flavorful.  The half rack came smothered in a mustard based barbecue sauce.... No other sauce available.  Beer selection was pretty good.  Service was fine, but the computer software messed up the bills.  Overall, smallish portions and  not particularly good.  Would I go back? No, there are many better choices in the area.",

At first the hostess didn't know where to sit us at a table and finally sat down, it took 10 minutes for a waitress to appear. The waitress didn't seem to be wanting to work or even give us her name when introduced.   The appetizer was order including what we were going to eat. Part of the appetizer the dough on the sausage was still raw and the sauce for the wings was not the correct one. I had order the sausage and mushroom flatbread by which on the menu states that has caramelizad onions on it, when it arrived it did not have none on it. My nephew order waffles and chicken, the piece of chicken wasn't even fully cooked and it was a larger piece. Chicken piece was sent back and spoke with Manager, another piece came back to us and it still the same way.   It was a great disappointment on the whole experience, I can say for sure that won't be returning again.",

Our waitress was fantastic (and I wish I could remember her name to give her the props deserved).  Quick to be seated and food came out reasonably fast. In general, great experience.   However, what they will need to fix is the price point. Food is good. Not exceptional. But it is priced for the high end, and they are not there. I got 7oz steak $17. A Ribeye is $22. A filet is $24. Would go down road to Texas Roadhouse for a better steak for less. Caprese chicken sandwich was good... $11.   Burger... $10. Know a few other people who went and they all said same as I am...cool place, good food. Just pricey for what it is.   I will go back, but will eat appetizers at the bar, which is more it's sweet spot. If they are going for more, hopefully owners read this and adjusts.",

The actual food we got was decent. On food alone I would have given them 3 stars, maybe even 3 1/2 for some dishes, including a very good flatbread. Decent food doesn't make up for poor treatment though. Hoping this was just a bad server and not indicative of what Jekyll & Hyde is all about.",

Took more than 5 minutes to get greeted by any of the three bar tenders back there, the bar was not busy maybe three other couples? The manager was worse than the bartenders, she stood at the bar top the entire 30 minutes we were there on her phone complaining about how much she \"hated closing shifts on the weekend\". Took more than 10 minutes to get drinks, would have had another round but no one checked on us to see if we wanted one. We were not even offered food menus. We got fed up and asked for the check, had to ask for the check from three different people until someone finally got it to us.  Sadly we won't be returning. Maybe if your manager was less worried about planning a couples thanksgiving dinner at her house and more worried about her guest, we would of had a better experience.",
