The menu is pretty simple: The LottaBurger that made them famous, pizza, onion rings, tater tots and the like.  What I love about Brightstar, though, is the escape it provides from chain restaurants and Charlotte's \"Fisher Price\" design. Tucked in a quiet wooded lot in Mt. Holly, the place reminds me of burger joints I visited near my grandparents' camp in New York's southern tier as a kid.  Grab a deck of cards, a few friends, and head out to Brightstar for an evening. It's not too far from the Belmont Drive-In Theatre, so you could make a True throw-back experience out of it.",

From the moment you drive up to the original drive-in and come into it's checker board floored dining room you are transported back to a time when food wasn't just processed and slapped onto a plate.  We ordered different versions of the burgers and fries and were treated to a taste from the past.  The fresh meat burgers (never frozen) were seared on a red hot flat-top until they were crispy around the edges and juicy in the middles.  Homemade slaw and chili covered my masterpiece, and the 1st bite sent me straight back into the days when life was simpler and food was awesome.  I can't say enough about this place, but will add that the hand scooped Mooresville ice cream and in-house \"rock n' roll\" radio station were the icing on the cake.  Can't wait t go back.",

A+ on the salad.  Lunch includes pizza buffet with the salad bar, but they rarely have more than one or two choices of cold, bland pizza.  We recently had a philly which was on special for lunch, and the flavor was great, but the sandwich was    very small.  My wife, who is not a big eater, was still hungry when we left.  This place has a lot of untapped potential when it comes to the food.   The staff is friendly, but there is very little table service.  This place is OK for convenience, since Mount Holly has little to offer food-wise, but don't go out of your way to get here.",

So not only had our food sat long enough for my bottom bun to absorb the coleslaw juice before arriving at the table, my mom pulled a hair out from her burger, no, not her hair. The sucker was wedged between the two slices of Texas toast. So I wI really wanted to enjoy a nostalgic meal at one of the only living Mt Holly originals. Oh, well.",

The burger patty plus slaw and tomato and pickles and cheese overlap the toasted oblong bun by an inch on either side. Finally figured out that there's just no way to be tidy eating this thing. Stuff will fall off into the styrofoam plate. Multiple napkins will be needed. It was great! I was also happy with the tater tots. But next time I will choose the salad bar on the side. It's not a great salad bar given that iceberg lettuce is the only lettuce but there's strawberries and mandarin oranges for those who would like a healthier side.  The place has great old-drive-in atmosphere. They need better ice tea and better signage. When you turn in, go right.",

The only other thing I would prefer differently is having the cheese on top of the burger instead of on the bottom. The last time I was here they also put mayo on the top bun which should be, in my opinion, on the bottom bun to prevent the juices of the burger getting the base bun soggy.",

It's tucked away in a neighborhood but its well worth the trip. It's like stepping back in time when drive-ins were all the hype only no one comes out; you go in.  The burgers are tasty, juicy and had all the toppings I like.  Its nothing fancy but the food and music make me want to return ... and I will!",

    "text": "This has to be one of the most hole-in-the-wallest places I've ever been. What makes it so cool is that in the era of mom and pop shops packing up, this place has been here for decades! There's even a poster on the wall of when Elvis died yall!! And they have an actual radio station on location playing all the hits! They get 2 stars just for ambiance and general bad-assedness! Two words...DRIVE IN!  The menu is very \"diner\". I got a blt and cowboy fried pickles. They also have cowgirl fried pickles. The difference you ask? Cowboy=Dill and Cowgirl=Sweet. Served with a side of rance, it was fabulous!! One of my friends got the salad bar which he liked. It's basic, but a great offering, none the less.   When you come across a place like this and you see lots of senior citizens there at lunchtime, you can't help but know that it's been around for a very long time, has great food, a great story and you should try it too. Glad we stumbled across it.",
