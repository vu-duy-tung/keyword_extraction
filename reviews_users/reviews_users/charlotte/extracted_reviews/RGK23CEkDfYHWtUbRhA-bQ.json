After casually mentioning it to the server that it was our first time here, the owner came by our table to chat with us and welcome us. I had the seared scallops with sweet potato hash and my husband had the seafood pasta. We both enjoyed it very much. For dessert we enjoyed the chocolate pot de creme. Delicious! On our way out we even got a congratulations from other diners surrounding us. It was the perfect anniversary dinner. Definitely recommend this place and we will be back.",

Setting would be more intimate if the walls were a darker, warmer color). Mixed reviews amongst the group on dinner. French onion soup was luke warm, hanger steak bland.  Scallops got positive marks.  Good selection at the bar.  This is a tough location.   I hope they can get the menu figured out.",

The bun was perfect and the shrimp were seasoned perfectly, the whole thing just worked. It was like a fancy po boy and the shrimp were nice and large. Grits were good also, and everything else we tried was really solid. Service was nice and friendly and just the right amount of tentativeness. We will definitely be going back as the cocktail menu is quite intriguing. Ambience is very nice and I like the small size of the restaurant.",

The braised short rib flat bread is to die for and I cannot wait to eat that again, soon!    They have an excellent signature cocktail list.  I enjoyed the Spicy Booty Loop.  On Thursday nights, the signature cocktails are $8.  The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly.  They could not have made us feel more welcome!  The Interior was clean, updated, and modern. They have a great large round booth that seats seven --who doesn't love a round table?  Needless to say, I will be back for more!",

Our server never once smiled and we waited 10-15 mins before she ever greeted the table which should have been a sign of things to come. She walked to the table and never introduced herself and just said what would you like to order. Never asked about drinks or anything. We ordered drinks and an app and got our app before the drink as we watched the drink sit at the side of the bar. We had to ask for napkins and silverware from another server because ours never came around once after she finally dropped our drinks off. Once we got our food from the bartender the server again didn't ask how everything was but the bartender did. The only time the server was on it was time to bring the check. We again sat waiting for her to pick up the check and she never did and we had to walk to the bar as she stood there talking with other co workers. We also witnessed her other table get up and go to the bar and have to ask for things like a refill/box/etc. The food was good and cocktail was awesome however when you pay $100 for lunch and service is terrible it makes you never want to go back and encourage others not to as well.",

Excellent broth, gooey cheese. Simple but surprisingly difficult to master. This place has. We tried the dry rub wings, and while the rub was awesome, we just wished the flavor had penetrated the meat. My husband went for the crab cake Benedict, and he stated the crab cakes were very well executed. He especially loved the crispy edge. I had the fried shrimp \"burger\". It wasn't like a shrimp burger from Shrimp Shack in Beaufort as it's not a patty, but the shrimp had a very light well seasoned breading. I changed my fries to the sweet potato hash browns, and it was a good call. The sweet potatoes are tender but crispy, and I loved the peppers roasted with them. Locals seem to know everyone here as many neighbors stopped in just to say \"hi\". Seems like a real \"Cheers\" kinda place.",

We had onion soup, salmon, and shrimp and grits and everything was yummy. My only complaint is that I didn't have room for dessert. The service was great and they were very attentive. The price was also more than fair for the portions. This is definitely a neighborhood gem that I will start to frequent even if I am alone!",

It was a little awkward when we walked up as they didn't have a host . We stood waiting at the host stand for like 5 minutes until one of the servers asked us if we would like a table. We noticed during our meal this happened to a few other people who arrived. Our server was friendly enough and did a good job handling the amount of tables shes had, we didn't feel neglected. The food we decent and the environment was pretty good.  It is a good place to go with family or with friends, I wouldn't recommend for a  romantic date as the tables are pretty close. I had the french onion soup to start, it was great! For my main, I had a salad and the salmon. It was average, but I am sure some of the other dishes would have been more interesting.",

Most everyone at the bar was eating dinner as well. There are about 5 high tops and bench/chair booths most all were full.  We were able to walk In and be seated. The ambiance was cozy and intimate.  There are three TVs which I usually don't care for at dinner but, the sound was off and the NFL playoffs were on, so wasn't distracting.  They played a great alternative 80's music which was fitting.  We started sharing the French onion soup.  We are very particular about our French onion as some tend to be oily and can leave an aftertaste.  This was wonderful, not heavily salted, fresh and the cheese was beautifully melted with a slight roasting on top.  I now wish I would have gotten a bowl all for myself!  My husband had the burger as an entree, cooked to order, it looked like a food porn picture.  Made with brioche bun, the tomato, onion and lettuce very fresh.  As my husband like medium rare, it was cooked perfectly.  I had the chicken pot pie and it is served with a mixed green salad and light balsamic dressing.  The pie had a layered puff pastry, real pastry, with buttery light layers.  The filling was creamy and the veggies fresh with a blend of fresh herbs.  Was a great choice for the cold night.  We will definitely be back!",

To me it seemed like just hotel bar food at best It could have just been what I ordered. Price didn't justify the quality, in my opinion.  A place where the beer and wine and social aspect is probably good for a group or date , but the food is just ok.  The servers were attentive and no issues there.  I don't know if I would battle the traffic and parking just to go back there.   The guy next to me ordered chicken wings and they did look good.  I don't know, try it and see, you might have a better experience.",

I recommend the pork chop entree -- it's a really nice size price of meat, pretty moist, and the apple butter sauce compliments the meat really well.

No real flavor to it. I think maybe even the store brand has more flavor than the sauce that it came with. I also asked the server for parmesan cheese to give the pasta more flavor and I never received it. She seemed busy with other tables and since it was just her serving the entire restaurant. My mom ordered the pork chop and she absolutely hated the sauce that came with it. The drink menu seemed pretty interesting and if I do come back it will only be for drinks and not food.",

I had a drink with titos and prosecco mixed with cucumbers. It was very refreshing and simple. Then for our main course we ordered the sea scallops with sweet potato hash and my date order the sirloin steak with frites, I believe. They were both delicious! Came out in a timely manner. The sweet potato hash had to be my absolute favorite! It was perfect to pair along with the scallops and the sauce that came on the plate too. I think it may have been an apple butter reduction of some sort. But it was good! My date enjoyed his med rare steak but only complaint on that was it may have been a bit too charred. But that's our preference.   Other than that, I enjoyed our service and our food. It was a good experience! Will definitely be coming back to try their brunch as well!",

I also saw the pics in yelp from that time frame that made the food look tantalizing. WRONG!! The good imaginative chef is no longer there. I went here today and got their most popular two meals: the chicken sandwich and the shrimp and grits. DISGUSTING! I should have known this wasn't going to end well when I arrived at 12:30 Saturday - the peak of lunchtime - and the place was COMPLETELY EMPTY!  But back to the food:  The chicken was way undercooked and had zero flavor. The shrimp and grits was also devoid of flavor and the grits were so under cooked they sort of crumbled in my mouth. To make it edible at home  I had to add my own andouille and creole salt. I also re-cooked it in my own oven. I repeat DISGUSTING!! I called back later to discuss my experience with a manager but none were there on a Saturday night and all I got was a confused girl who didn't know her own work title but was full of anger and attitude. WONT. FUCKING. BE. BACK!",

Don't be fooled-it's a \"small plate\" but is still really filling. The Mac and cheese was 4.5/5 stars for me. Really, really good. The boys loved their fried shrimp sandwiches. I snuck a bite out of my hubs sandwich and instantly decided that when I come back, that's what I have to have. The spicy mayo on it was also really good. We also shared a side of the panzanella. It's basically a crouton salad with some heirloom tomatoes, arugula, and shaved Parmesan marinated in balsamic vinegarette. My husband and I enjoyed it. Wish there were more tomatoes though. This place was an overall win for everyone. Fun fact-they also have coloring books and crayons for kids!",

(GO PANTHERS)   We ordered a bottle of wine, flatbread, and wings.  $70 for those three things and we got the cheapest bottle of wine.    The flatbread was really good, wings were subpar and service was amazing!  I hate to say this but I agree with the other yelpers that the price is too high...  but again the service was really good.    It makes me sad but I probably won't be back because of the price.",

Tonight, they only had a few patrons at dinner which worked out good for the group I was with as the restaurant is small. High top tables - chairs are super uncomfortable, we all thought so, sit in booth if you go. Food was good. Wings were flavorful and hot, ranch was watered down. Shrimp burger was plentiful but the fried shrimp could have been seasoned more. Lightly fried, big shrimp. Fries were good and looked hand cut. Friend got scallops and enjoyed them - plated nicely. Other friend got burger medium well and it was too well done, not med well but thats understandable, should get it medium. Will come back, but want to try their brunch.",

Mainly because it was a quick family gathering and we didn't know how things would work out before we headed back to our various destinations.  So when we decided what to do we started trying to get a brunch reservation.  We're so lucky that our first couple of selections were full, because that's what led us to this restaurant.  We had a mix of quiche, french onion soup, salads, chicken and waffles, crab cakes and pasta.  (had to figure out what the 2 year old granddaughter might want)  Everything was excellent, empty plates all around!  Definitely on the return list.",

    "text": "We were out and about for a friend's birthday and just happened to walk into a goldmine.   We walked into a quaint, warm environment on a cold April night. Greeted warmly in stark contrast to the outside temperature, we felt right at home when we walked in. Even other patrons greeted us and told us to come in out of the cold. Seating selections include booth/table combos, high tops and bar seating. We chose a booth/table option and had Darby and Brodie (yes, beautiful twins) as our duo servers. My husband realized that our servers were actually twins! Both were super friendly and helpful in guiding us through selecting a few good bites to \"supplement\" our dinner we had earlier. We selected wings and peel and eat shrimp. Perfect combos paired with a few beers, rose and a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon.  What struck us most about our experience tonight was the customer service.  Our servers were perhaps the most attentive we have had in awhile. And where can you go that the owner, Andy, comes and sits down with you at your table to have a conversation? I think he actually had about three or four encounters with us! He was super friendly and engaging. He was considering adding port to the menu and even gave us samples. Super friendly and down-to-earth gentleman. When we got there, he had on an apron...an owner who doesn't shy away from working the business.   We were informed that brunch is served on weekends. Why did they tempt us? We just might have to go back in the morning!  This place is a must-try!    I regret not having the nerve to ask Andy for a picture. Trust me, he's a really nice guy.",

    "text": "Date night Sunday where we decided to check out two new places near our casa.  We stopped into Turnhouse Grille around 5pm on a Sunday. The place was pretty quiet but we were welcomed in with open arms! Sat at the bar and proceeded to get the low down from the bar tender.  Turnhouse is not officially opened yet and is just doing a soft opening. They haven't advertised a ton just yet either. We absolutely loved the bartender, who was so enthusiastic and excited about her job. She showed us her different thoughts on future cocktails and her change-ups on some of the classics. She even keeps a running notebook of different funny names that come up around the city as an inspiration for future cocktail names. Halfway through our drinks, an owner (there are two, both were there) came in and shook our hands and introduced himself. It was cool getting this inside peak of the runnings of this place.   The ambiance is fairly relaxed with a nice size bar, 2 tvs, and ample seating. Small mason jar candle lights at a nice touch.   For this occasion, we stuck with just drinks (though the food menu looked amazing and we will definitely be back). I got the Booty Loop and my husband got a mixed drink that had whiskey (or bourbon...dont remember) in it and wine (odd I know!). Wish I would have remembered the name cause it was absolutely delish! The Booty Loop was super refreshing and the perfect balance of tart and sweet. I thought the cocktail prices were extremely well priced.   I am so excited to have stumbled upon this place and can't wait to see the amazing things that come out of it. Go check it out! Great job guys!",

My wife ordered a french onion soup that ended up being the best dish of the evening, but its broth lacked richness and the onions were not caramelized. Her \"roasted chicken pot pie\" had a massive (2\" thick?) biscuit-like thing on top of it, rather than the thin, crispy crust that I've always thought of as one of the hallmarks of chicken pot pie. She didn't finish.  My dish, though: that's where it gets weird. I ordered a pork chop. The chop itself was fine, but the sauce and... apples? that came with it were so overdone that they were bitter. The fruit was unrecognizably black and shriveled. There was no flavor discernible throughout the dish other than \"somebody burnt this.\"",

It was a little hard to find thanks to it being tucked away in a lower corner. Although it faces the street, the parking lot is behind the complex and you have to go down some stairs.  As someone who is always on the lookout for local beers when traveling, I was happy to discover several on tap. Even better, our visit coincided with $3.50 craft drafts on Wednesdays. Perfect timing!  Food-wise, I ordered their grilled hanger steak that came with corn succotash and shoestring fries. The girlfriend went with seared sea scallops on top of a sweet potato hash with a bacon apple ginger reduction. Both dishes were excellent and we enjoyed every bite.  We caved on the dessert and ordered their strawberry key lime pie. More strawberry than key lime, it was a solid way to end a fantastic meal.",

The staff was very attentive and polite the entire evening.  It wasn't too slow, too busy, or too loud, which was perfect for a relaxing night out.  For dinner we decided to try the Bao buns as an appetizer, while I chose the scallops and my friend opted for the shrimp burger as our entrees. Everything tasted delicious! My only suggestion (like another reviewer), would be to add at least one more scallop to the entree to feel worth the $21 price.   Since we were enjoying the atmosphere already, we decided to relocate to the bar after eating and had another friend join us. This time I tried one of their signature cocktails, and I would highly suggest the Phat City.   Definitely check this place out!",

The food was great and atmosphere is simple, but cool. We had the Monte Cristo sandwich and chicken biscuit. Mimosas were more of an artisan/craft style, but still really good. Don't expect the typical bar OJ with cheap champagne. Lots of great flavors and some unique dishes. My only negative comment was the service was slightly slow, but this is a mom-n-pops, small time restaurant, so it's understandable. It's not huge and not employing a large staff, so you could experience slightly longer than usual wait times. I could easily see this place having a special spot in a great location one day, but until then it's my diamond in the rough. A solid 4 stars.",

Our newly launched nonprofit hosted a fundraiser event at the facility on a Monday night (when they are typically closed). Even though they had to come in when they are normally off, the staff was more than accommodating.   Super intimate, The Turnhouse Grille is a unique space for a small gathering. The service is impeccable. Seriously some of the nicest people I've ever met behind the bar and waiting on tables. The food is also delicious - get the Brussels sprouts, Caesar salad and/or the shrimp burger. All amazing!   I can't thank Andy and his staff enough for their hospitality and flexibility in facilitating this event. I plan on becoming a regular at this establishment, and hope you will, too!",

If you remember, the quickest way to my heart is either through a cute puppy dog or some really good Brussels sprouts. I'm not sure how the Turnhouse feels about pups on their patio, but their chef knocked it out of the fricking park with those Brussels.  They've got an amazing crunch on the exterior leaves, but the inside has juuuuuust the right amount of bite to them. The pancetta adds the insane saltiness that enhances the flavor of the balsamic glaze... I mean, it's one of my top two sprouts for sure.  And the spare rib flatbread is back! Y'all. It's got crispy onion straws on it! The sauce, though. That sauce is a kick in the taste buds. It's not too sweet, not too spicy... The balance is perfect.   And to drink, I ordered the Bourbon Orchard which was crafted by Chad and thoroughly enjoyed by me. Twice. Anytime you mix some Jim Beam with rum, you can expect a good time. Black cherry rum? Even better.",

Turnhouse Grille properly named after the owner playing golf one day decided to open up a restaurant and I am happy he did such a thing!   First the mussels are by far the best mussels in Charlotte! If you can find a place that is better please don't hesitate and tell me because I'll be there to compare. There is nothing like fresh mussels but when they taste this good you will want to jut order them!   Our service was excellent and impeccable here. I asked what I should try and she was genuinely giving me her personal experience and steered me right way every time!   I order the pork chop and I they give Carpe Diem a run for their money on best pork chop. The pork chop was literally cooked to perfection with a moist nice center with just the right amount of seasoning.   You got a second so I can talk about the Brussels sprouts? What!!!?!!! The Brussels sprouts are so good! Warning they have bacon in them so if you are vegan or vegetarian please be aware!   I didn't know I was eating bacon until after my first bite or two when I noticed it. Well I am honestly not a big pork lover besides bacon every now and then but this place is the place to go!   The salmon and burger were equally as good! You are not going to go wrong at Turnhouse Grille. Happy eats!",

It is small with an intimate feel inside, with several outside table as well.  They offer an extensive menu with a great option of choices. On my most recent visit I tried the Cheeseburger with Fries. One of the best I've had, cooked a perfect medium! The Fries were also great! In addition to their food menu, they do have a cocktail menu with several unique drinks, as well as beer and wine.  I'll be sure to make this a stop when I'm in the area, especially when I'm craving a burger !",

First off this place is intimate and a cross between casual and classy. Come here for a date night or just to grab dinner and drinks with a group of friends. All of the above is good here. I was very impressed because the owner had come in and was drinking wine and laughing and mingling with all of the guests. Everyone seemed to know him. The overall atmosphere was fun and I felt like I was having dinner and drinks at a friends house.  This is not something I have seen at any restaurant I have ever been to.   Second and most importantly, the food was GOOD! We ordered the mussels as an appetizer. I don't even like mussels, but I tried one and I was grabbing for more! My boyfriend got the pork chop as an entree and it was absolutely phenomenal! I still have dreams about this pork chop!   The service was also very friendly! When we asked the waitress what she recommended you could tell that she genuinely thought very highly of the food and gave us excellent recommendations.  Overall, this is an outstanding restaurant and I left here beyond impressed. You will not be disappointed!!",

It draws in the older crowd and there seemed to be a few locals that visit this place often hanging out at the bar.   The cocktail list looked delicious, but I opted for a beer. I got a blue moon and it was served in a chilled glass and was ice cold! Yummy!   For dinner I split meals with Jon B and Kate. I got the shrimp burger with Brussels, Jon got the fried chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese and Kate got the burger with fries. And yes, we successfully split 3 sandwiches. Haha!   My shrimp burger was more like a poboy. I was expecting it to be packed vs breaded shrimp on a bun. It was tasty, but nothing special. The fried chicken was tasty especially with the pimento but my favorite was the burger. It was cooked perfectly and super juicy.   For the sides, I really enjoyed the Brussels however their fries were very good. I would skip the Gouda Mac next time.   I won't be in a rush to get back but it's a place someone wants to go I won't say no. I've heard their brunch is bomb so I might need to come back for that instead!",

Every dish that was brought out of the kitchen grasped my attention. Cam the barkeep made a great recommendation. We had the truffle crab mac & cheese, and order of wings ( both flavors) and the Bloody Old Fashion.  We will be back. Dishes that looked great: the Shrimp Burger and a salad topped with a SUBSTANTIAL piece of salmon.",

Our biggest surprise is how many open tables and seats there were given how wonderful our experience was. To start, the service was excellent. The server was friendly and attentive and the food was timed appropriately. The menu had a great variety of items, leaving everyone pleased to find something they'd enjoy. Not a single one of our entrees missed the mark. We had the short rid benedict, the burger, the fried chicken and biscuit sandwich, and the shrimp burger. They were presented nicely, generous portions, and plate licking good. Price point is right on where it needs to be. The cocktail menu looked interesting, but we stuck with their $5 mimosas. I wish the glass was a little larger, but for the deal it was fine. The ambiance is very nice and I look forward warmer weather when they open up a patio service area. My only critical comment is that the high top chairs are not very comfortable. I felt like I was always falling out of my seat, but this distraction wasn't enough for me take away star given how wonderful everything else was for our brunch.  Also, I don't very often mention it, but on top of all this, their health score is an incredible 98.0!  Bon a petit! I hope you enjoy as much as we did.",

We go for the early specials of raw oysters and steamed .  The oysters were local, but way smaller this time then last.  The shrimp is good but just sprinkled with OldBay doesn't seem to be boiled in it.  So it lacks flavor.  The $1.00 per wing are really good. Fried and then grilled.  My only complaint is it seems like it takes a long time to get food, especially when were the only patrons in the place.    It's in the lower level of a strip mall, easy to miss. There is an elevator on the upper floor by the Italian restaurant if needed.",

TurnHouse Grille has been opened for almost two years. The moment you walk in you instantly enjoy the classic ambiance, from the beautiful chandeliers hanging to the music playing.  \"Why Can't We Get Along\" That my friends is the name of the sauce I chose, I would describe it as a brilliant blend of sweet and spicy. I ordered the Hef wings which comes with another sauce option called Orge sauce, describe on the menu as \"local (all purpose) craft bbq\"  I brought one of my close friends from 7th grade along and he decided on the Shrimp Burger. From his reaction I can tell the fried shrimp served on a warm brioche bun made his taste buds dance. The Shrimp Burger comes with coleslaw and cocktail sauce but he opted out of both lol   I cannot end this without acknowledging the fast and friendly staff. The place was packed but the servers were extremely hospitable and served us in a timely manner!",

Their menu is creative and original.   It is just not a typical grille!   I had some gourmet chicken wings with blue cheese and hand cut fries.  The wings were prepared with a zesty sauce that complimented the dish. There were a variety of salads and sandwiches, including a shrimp burger on the menu.  It is an intimate space with a magnificent bar area.  The restaurant was sleepy today, but it is vacation season and restaurant week, so I get it.  It's located directly below Jason's Deli adjacent to Park Road Shopping Center. If you don't know exactly where you are going, it is a little bit hard to find.  Absolutely go enjoy the food and the ambience in The Turnhouse Grille.   It could well be your favorite new restaurant, if you haven't already discovered it!   Three thumbs up and I plan to be a loyal patron.",

The chicken was a tad bit on the dry side but overall, it was still very good.  I'm also a huge fan of grits and theirs did not disappoint.  Remember that $2 egg I decided against? Yeah, I regretted that as soon as the table next to me got their order and their chicken biscuit was covered in a generous portion of scrambled eggs.     Overall, we both enjoyed our meals.

My wife's Caesar salad was huge and the French onion soup has a satisfying rich depth to its flavor.  My order of PEI mussels was exceptional and a big time do-over.    They gave me a choice of broth:  classic white wine, or tequila lime.  I ordered the tequila lime loving every succulent bite (even got a \"really?\" stare from Lori when I picked up the bowl and guzzled some of that juice down)!  Hey, it's not that fancy a place!  I'll be back with friends, too.",

Placed a order for the spicy booty loop drink.Was quite tasty but not $14 tasty. The looks of this place i do love as well as the laid back scene with old school music and more mature crowd.Their was one small problem my friend as she was drinking her drink she had a grey goose mixed with vodka she found a hair in it as she was drinking it the waitress did bring her out another one and apologized. Look forward to seeing what the actual dishes are like.",

    "text": "Yo! What's up with people not coming to this joint???? It was dead. Calling all yelpers! Check this place out. They pimpin when it comes to food and service! Forreal!  It was just me and my homies there. My home E appreciated the fact that they didn't have sports playing on the TV's Hint hint ladies. I know how it is going to a joint with your guy, and his eyes are glued to the tv cause some sports game is on. Not heeeerreee!!!  So I'm on a veggie and protein diet and it was either the salmon dish or the short rib dish. Whatever I decided on the lady was very accommodating as she overheard my diet plan.   The short rib dish was fiyah!!! It was so tender and flavorful. Literally, meat just falling off the bone. I couldn't eat the root veggies because there's sweet potatoes in it (yea I can't eat that) so I got the sauteed Spinach which was pretty good.   The top of the pepper shaker was loose when my friend tried to add pepper to her pasta dish so they made her a new one, allowing me and my other homie to eat the fish from the dish (no charge) so of course I took a scallop which was big, juicy, and cooked perfectly with a delicious buttery flavor, as well as a shrimp that was the same. Loved the flavors. I like the ambience. I'd definitely go back... especially for brunch... well when I'm not eating only protein and veggies.",

In fact, the service we received was above and beyond in every way. I went with the French onion soup and short rib flatbread. The food was really good. Where it was missing for me was the price. I had soup, flatbread and one bottle of beer and my tab was $30. To me, that was a bit pricey for what I got. With that being said, the food was good and we had a good experience there.   Note: there was some CSI type of show on the television that had decaying bodies on an autopsy table and a brain being sliced. I was a detective in a previous life and love that stuff but not while I'm eating.",

We got the burger, french onion soup, peel and eat shrimp, and cheese plate.  The $14 dollar burger we ordered medium well was extremely overcooked and burnt.  The bacon tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and had no crispiness.  The Cheese plate was essentially over portioned wedges of deli cheese without any type of attractive presentation, and the shrimp was basic steemed shrimp with some old bay.  This place is charging premium prices for sub par food.  They were empty on a Friday night and perhaps that is why.  Don't understand the good reviews?  Service was attentive and friendly and the only positive of our experience.",

Although it came out medium rare it obviously had been put on a high heat grill to speed up the process and completely burnt on the outside. I myself had a salad with salmon which was also burnt on the outside and over cooked. I asked to add goat cheese to my salad and when the check came realized they charged an extra $3 to my $15 salad. The servers wear leggings and a t shirt with tennis shoes...I've served in all kinds of places in charlotte before from bars to fine dining I'll never judge a uniform but for what the restaurant seems to be, it should change its menu. I've never left a bad review but I just feel like this place isn't really anything worth spending your money on. Two glasses of wine, a just okay steak, and a crispy salmon salad for $100 just wasn't worth it at all.",
