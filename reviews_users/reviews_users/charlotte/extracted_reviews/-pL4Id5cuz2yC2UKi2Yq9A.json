I got the grilled skirt steak platter...a bit expensive, but I got to choose how the steak was cooked. Enough food to feed me x3 (I'm a gastric bypass survivor). Tons of steak, rice and beans! Some kind of guacamole garnishment on top, that made everything else tasty! I got it 'to go' and I would absolutely return to eat inside! This restaurant is in a small strip mall on E.Independence and because of the road changes there if you are not aware, you could pass it by. If you enter via Monroe Rd, turn on Lanier and go until it dead ends and you will be at the strip mall it is in. It will be my new BEST go to restaurant for the Cotswold area I live inn.",

I am hooked on the chicken fajitas and find myself trying to talk the hubs into going here at least once a week (he usually shows restraint and limits me to every other week).   As much as I love the food, it's the service that really makes this place shine. Never any issues if you ask for extras, want more chips and salsa? Just ask and it will appear before you, no hassle like some other places. The place is always clean and I find the seating to be comfortable.   The only food I have tried are the fajitas, and at some places I think that makes me narrow minded but when it comes to Mexican food, I like what I like!   I am so happy to live so close to this place!! I'm already thinking about going for lunch since I'm guessing the hubs won't want to go for dinner.",

When I worked a few miles from Las Margarita, I musta passed this place in a run down (seemingly half vacant) strip mall on seedy Independence a million times. Muchos Gracias to my coworker at my next job for enlightening me.   In the eight (nine???) years I've been here, this is the best Meh-he-can I've found. When you walk in for lunch and the place is fulla south of the border patrons, that's a great sign. When the eats are cheap, like the best places in L.A., that's an even better sign. Fajitas. Good. Street tacos. Freakin' good. Burritos, chimichangas, enchiladas... amen&pass the salsa, I'm home!!!! I have never been disappointed. I don't make the drive often enough (I live in the north boonies) but when I'm down there, it's Las Margarita for mi, mi hombre, mijo y bambino.",

Probably some of the best enchiladas (chicken) we have had in a long time. I tend to order chicken-steak fajitas. We always get beef nachos. Good salsa...not too spicy. We always get our food to go, but if you want to eat in there is plenty of room, it's clean and the service is always good and friendly! So from a big Mexican food fan who is used to food in Chicago, go ahead and give this place a try. I am sure you won't be disappointed when you realize it's affordable and you have leftovers! Be alert though when you drive to this place, it's in a strip mall on the right-hand side if traveling East on Independence...just before Brazaz",

We saw this restaurant on Yelp and figured we would give it a try since we were in the neighborhood.  It has cute decor on the inside, not the best location for a restaurant but some things can't be helped and it looks like the area is being updated/remodeled/reworked.  The salsa was okay, not the typical awesome salsa but more chunky and two types.  The cheese dip was titled Land O'Lakes Cheese dip so that basically tells you how that was.  We tried the veggie quesadilla and carne asada.  Both were okay, smaller portions than most Mexican spots which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Service was okay.  I tried a margarita, it tasted like one your friend would attempt to make for you at home.  We really wanted to like this place based on other reviews, but it just didn't compare to other spots in the area.  Prices were reasonable though and if they rework the menu a bit and add some classic dishes and go the more classic route with their salsa, and cheese dip they'd draw a bigger crowd in on a weekend evening, which is when we went and it was pretty empty.  We'd probably give it another shot then.",

The menu seems to be reasonably varied, and had a number of items that sounded good to me.  Plates for the entire group (around 10) came out very close together, which I appreciated so much.  It is SO awkward to be the one stuck at a table for 20 minutes without anything, while the rest of the table tries to decide if they should be polite and wait for you (and subject themselves to cold food) or to dig in and be rude.  I chose the Pollo Asado, which arrived on a GIANT plate.  I received 2 pieces of pounded, citrus-marinated chicken breast, rice and beans, and a pico de gallo that was different from the one served on the table (spicier, and a bit more macerated.  Also yummy).  The chicken had just the right amount of char, and the marinade had clearly served it well, since it managed to remain flavorful and not dry.  Service overall seemed to be on point, yet unobtrusive.  Our server didn't bat an eye when we announced that each of us would like separate checks, and to go boxes were brought without me feeling like I was being rushed out the door.  I enjoyed my meal, and would return when I happened to be in the neighborhood.",

It was Cinco de Mayo, and Mexican seemed like an ideal choice.  The menu is good, and the lunch specials are available even on weekends. We each ordered one of the lunch specials for $5-$6. My husband ordered the Arroz con Pollo (his standard) and I tried a dish new to me... \"Chilaquile\" or something like that. I was in it for the tomatillo sauce. Kind of like an open faced burrito with corn tortillas.  The beer was cold. The salsa (both a veggie based slaw-type salsa and a regular thin medium tomato-based salsa) was good. The chips were fresh and warm. Our food was excellent, and portion sizes were generous for the prices we paid at lunchtime. Service was fantastic and a great soccer game was on the telly.  For me, a 5-star rating means there's nothing I can find fault with or suggest improvement upon. Las Margaritas is a humble strip mall Mexican restaurant that serves delicious food at great prices and with attentive service. For what it is, I can suggest nothing at all to improve upon.

Las Margaritas is only a few blocks from my work place, so it is one of my regular lunch places. The food is good and their prices are great. They have over 20 lunch items all around $6. They give you tons of food even at lunch. (Compared to Monterrey, who's lunch portion is about half the size of dinner.) The staff is always very friendly and service is good.   A few issues I have are 1) sometimes their shredded chicken can be a little tough, I think sometimes they don't shred it enough. 2) The orange cheese (cheddar I guess) , though I have learned to live with it. 3) Salsa is so so but I do like their pico.  My favorite dishe is the Chilaquiles. It is tortilla chips cooked with some kind of sauce with shredded chicken and some sort of white cheese. Doesn't sound that good, but it is delicious. Love the vegetarian burrito, the enchiladas (ground beef), Pollo con arroz and Carnitas. Because I normally only eat lunch here, I can't really judge the more expensive entrees.  Overall, large portions of good food, for a reasonable price, served by friendly staff. A solid 4 stars in my book.",

I opted for chilaquiles which were pretty solid and tasted damn near as good the next dar when I microwaved them at the office. So that's like $3 per lunch?! Insane.",

    "text": "We dined here last night based on yelp reviews and it was close to our hotel. The place is not all that fancy - located on a busy main road with a bunch of construction going on. Once inside we were greeted by our very friendly server. Chips, salsa and pico quickly followed. My husband is extremely picky about his margaritas and our Texas margaritas on the rocks did not disappoint. Our food arrived quickly and portions were generous. I really enjoyed my mojarra frita. I order it often, and I particularly like the way this one was seasoned, and was extra crispy. I was surprised this place wasn't busier on a Saturday night. It might be the location, or the road construction but based on food, drinks and service, I would give them a try if you're in the area!",

    "text": "Las Margaritas is known for its fantastic carnitas de puerco, which come in a huge portion size, garnished with such gastronomic delights as pickled red onions and guacamole. I've also really enjoyed most of the vegetarian menu, which is about the same size and selection as many other Mexican restaurants in town. The pollo poblano is wonderfully rich with mole sauce. If you're looking for a cheap dinner, the burrito supremo with either chicken or ground beef is the way to go; it's big and topped with tomatoes, cheese, and guacamole.  Lunch is cheap, delicious, and generous. It's the only time they offer the delicious avocado tostada. You can get the lunch specials on weekends, which more places should do.  The decor is bright, with an open-ductwork ceiling that has been painted the same yellow as the walls. Recently I noticed they've hung some sombreros from the ceiling in between the lights. The overall effect is festive and feels more open than it really is.  Portion sizes are downright majestic on many of the entrees. It's not the most authentic Mexican food around (for one thing, they use a lot of yellow cheese), but it's delicious and served by a friendly and attentive wait staff. They're quick to offer seemingly endless refills of the free chips, salsa, and a pico de gallo that I want to just eat up with a spoon all by itself.",

We decided to go with the all you can eat and drink brunch buffet, which was excellent and included chicken enchiladas, patatas con tomate, and a custom omelette bar. Our waitress, Angie, wrote her name down on our paper tablecloth at the beginning, which I thought was nice and was only the start of her extremely personalized and wonderful service throughout our dining experience. Sitting out on the patio with the fans blowing in our faces as we drank our awesome bottomless drinks (the mojitos are out of this world) felt like a really authentic experience. and Angie bringing us our tequila shots followed by sangrita chasers was a plus too! All in all a great experience and would definitely recommend to everyone in town for a unique Sunday brunch.",

I noticed in the menu, desserts was spelled \"deserts.\"  I did not order any, but it was not because of the misspelling.

However, if you want plentiful, inexpensive, quick, and tasty Mexican food, I totally nominate this place.  I love love LOVE guacamole.  Matter of fact, I feel like I'm kind of a connoisseur of of guacamole, and so I get pretty ecstatic when I find a good batch of it.  I can honestly say that their guacamole ranks pretty highly in my book.  It tastes fresh, not too salty, and can be purchased for quite a reasonable price here (less than $4, I believe, for a pretty generous portion).  Their chips and salsa are wonderful as well.  They have nice, thick tortilla chips, which taste fresh, warm, and homemade.  They bring out two different salsas to go with them; one smooth and one more chunky.  Both are different and equally wonderful.  My partner and I both ordered combos from them.  I had a tamale and chile relleno, both of which were pretty tasty.  I have never had a chile relleno quite like that, which was more like an omelet with cheese, chiles, and meat.  I will warn you, both of them had quite a bit of grease leaking out of them, which suits me just fine but could be a turn-off to people who don't care for really greasy food.  My partner ordered a taco, which he really enjoyed as well.  I really like their rice as well.  I thought it had a mild flavor, not too salty, and no overwhelming tomato taste (which I don't care for in rice).  Their beans were not bad as well, and tasted like typical refried beans.  While I didn't order them, they had some great drink specials and prices on drinks.  Service there was wonderful - our food came out quickly, and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  Parking does not seem like a problem, but it may be a little difficult to get into the parking lot if coming west on Independence.  The decor was bright and typical of many Mexican restaurants.  I am totally excited to hit this place up again.",

I cant even remember where it was that we used to go, but we tried this place once and we never went back to our original hole.  Very quick as expected,  we have probably ordered 10-15 (with various friends we would bring along)  different things on the menu and I cant remember one we didnt like enough to order again.   Great place, kind of a pain with all of the independence construction, but whatever, I mean its Independence, I feel its been under construction for 20 years.",

The friendly owners and staff are committed to serving perfectly prepared traditional Mexican food with special touches that keep us coming back.  Try the satisfying pork tacos - simple and flavorful (be sure to ask for the green salsa, it's delicious).  Their tortilla soup is homey and comforting.  We love everything we order, but keep coming back to the combination plate.  Our usual choice is chile rellenos (the delicate omelet-like coating makes it special) and an earthy tamale stuffed with pork. The accompanying refried beans and rice are exceptionally good - we clean our plates every time.  We request our platters super hot so the rice is crispy on the edges and the refried beans are slightly baked.     The restaurant is super clean and perfect for families, groups or an informal date.",

This place really isn't bad by any means but it definitely isn't in the same ballpark of some of my other hot spot joints.   The food quality is OK depending on what you're getting I suppose. Personally, I was a little offended my carnitas were of the chunky and deep fried variation. Not my cup of tea man. The nachos and cheese dip were as expected.   The kid's quesadilla was the smallest quesadilla on the face of this planet. The potion sizes otherwise seem really decent, I will admit that. Prices are pretty modest with a diverse menu and good selection of alcohol.   I wasn't that impressed with the layout/ atmosphere. It feels more like a fast food restaurant than a nicer sit-down restaurant.  My kid may or may not have gotten sick here.   If I found myself in the area again, I might give the menu another go around.",

Yelp led me here a few weeks ago. And then I came back a week later. Fast forward to today, I took my roommate here. To sum it up, I'm three for three in the weeks of September.  The lunch menu here is a pretty good deal. Most of the meals are less than $6. Today I went with a combination of enchilada and taco. The roomie went arroz con pollo. Huge portions. She took half of hers home for lunch. I accidentally consumed everything on my plate. Gah, I've got to get back into yoga if I keep eating like this. I think our bill was maybe $16 with tax.  The chips come with both a salsa and a pico slaw type salsa. I recommend mixing the two together. You're welcome.  The people who work here are really friendly. During my first visit here, one of the waitresses sat and walked me through the menu. So nice.   Getting back on Independence can take some patience. I avoid it and go out a back way. The road dumps you at Sharon Amity. Perfect for me. I just have to take Monroe to make the trek home.  Craving some Mexican and some chips and salsa? This place hits the spot.",

    "text": "My sister invited me to CLT to come celebrate my nephew's 2nd birthday.  This is apparently his favorite restaurant, so I decided to make the trek from MEM to come see family and friends.   One thing I would like to note is with all of the construction going on, it is a pain in the ass to enter/exit.  Make sure you get it right the first time, or it may take another 10 minutes to go around the block.  We finally made it, and I assume sis made reservations for us, as we got a long table at the bar for 12 or so people.  A 2 year olds birthday at the bar- that's what I am talking about!  The decor was simple, yet colorful.  The menu was straightforward Mexican.  I ordered some Texas (shrimp chicken steak) fajitas.  Mind you I was pretty hungry.  The food ending up coming out and the one thing I couldn't help but notice was how big all of the plates were.  And heavy.  You could do 10 reps with a plate and call it a workout.    Two other things I noticed off the bat- where was the cheese, and how am I supposed to make only 3 fajitas with a plate this big?  I tried to venture outside of my normal fajita eating habits (just meat, with lots of cheese).  It was solid!  The grease replaced the cheese I guess you could say.  After I packed 3, I just ate the rest of it off the skillet.    While I was eating and the staff was checking on us, the waitress kept rubbing on my shoulders and such.  I was about to tell her you can take me out back but I am with my family.  At that moment, I felt like \"Gator\" in \"The Other Guys\".  Awkward? Slightly...  I didn't drink anything alcoholic (saved it for after), but they did have a full bar.  The do sell Coke as well (yea!)- so that was a plus.  I can't even remember if I had dessert either.    This is some solid authentic Mexican here, and it's definitely different than what I am used to having.  Worth a shot!",

We took one of the other reviews advice and mix the salsa and slaw together.   We started off with cheese dip that comes in a bowl so if you like cheese dip make sure you order that. The mango frozen margaritas were delicious and I'm a huge fan of the Midori margarita.  We decided to split meals so we had the shredded beef quesadilla the Chicken soup and the shredded chicken chimichanga. This soup you have to try it comes in like a gallon size bowl so there's plenty take-home.  So if you're craving Mexican want a margarita and need enough food to eat the next day come on by won't be disappointed.",

The owner/manager came over during our meal to introduce herself and mentioned that she likes to make a point to know each and every one of her customers. She asked our name, made a connection of how she could remember them easily, and assured us she looked forward to greeting us by name next time. Just from observation, she really does. Before she even came to our table, you could tell this place has regulars, because she was greeting table after table by name like old friends.  I wish the food had been better. We liked the salsa they provide with the chips but the chips needed salt (and we do not usually like salty things, so that's saying something.) We ordered the Fresh Guacamole and it was good, but nothing special; just mashed avocados with some diced tomatoes and onions. We actually asked for some extra limes to add to it, and it did brighten it up some. I got the Chimichanga with the shredded beef. The filling was good, but the tortilla was actually very doughy/soggy...like it hadn't been cooked all the way through. Or like it was too thick and as a result turned \"dumpling\" with the juice from the filling. I ended up just cutting it open and eating the filling and leaving the tortilla. The rice and beans were okay but had very little flavor. My husband got the Deluxe Burrito and he got it with ground beef. I liked his a little better, but it still wasn't anything noteworthy.   The menu is huge, so there's certainly more options to try. And I wouldn't mind trying it again given the excellent service. But I have a feeling the service is really what makes this place so popular.",

    "text": "First thing - holy portions! This is a place where you can definitely share an entree unless you haven't eaten in a while. Or if you love leftovers then you'll be in heaven. For the price, it's a pretty good deal - especially if you make 2-3 meals from each dish.  Fajita nachos - I always prefer the flavoring and cuts on fajita meat over shredded or ground, seems to be higher quality also.  Sopa de Tortilla - not my favorite in town. It's large, but it doesn't have as much flavor as I'd like. It's also on the greasy side.   Carne Asada - good flavor, very simple dish. If you're in the mood for juicy beef its our go to.   Pollo Asado - staple chicken dish, again good flavors and balanced dish. Definitely recommend if you're a poultry person.  Enchiladas are also good. Really a classical Tex Mex joint, we always have a good time. Staff is nice, and they love it if you speak Spanish.",

Over the last year I have visited several times and the food and service has changed. After loving this place and having faith they just had some off nights, I decided to give them one last shot last night. And, unfortunately everything is still lacking. Tables were dirty, food was bland, missing any flavor and service was non existent. Unlike many Saturday nights the crowd was sparse too, maybe a sign the food has changed.",

The food is not consistent and it's tasteless.  My last 3 orders have been the supreme taco salad and the ingredients have varied each time.  One time I had lots of lettuce and black beans, but this time there was hardly any black beans, sour cream or lettuce.  I had to look hard to find the lettuce or black beans.  But there was a ton of shredded chicken!  The other shameful part is each time I have to add spices and hot sauce to enjoy any flavor.  Such a shame because this place and all the menu items used to be great.",

At the recommendation of my server I went with the burrito ranchera which was steak with onions and peppers rolled in a tortilla topped with cheese and served with beans and rice.  There was absolutely no flavor to this meal. All those Mexican spices that you come to love were missing and this tasted like something you'd get at a Mexican place in the upper Midwest. The beans were runny and not even their hot salsa which was actually medium could save it.  The best part of this meal was the chips and regular salsa. I may actually need to cross this one off of my list of decent Mexican places.",

It turns out she knows most of the servers there, as she and her ex-boyfriend would frequent the place quite often last year.  WOW! We were impressed by the service, the portions, and the freshness of the food. The Pico De Gallo is great. The salsa is great. The guacamole is wonderful. It's all fresh, and the chips are warm!  The plates are at least 16 inches in diameter, and there's enough food on the typical entree to feed two adults. My 84-year-old parents shared a steak plate that filled them up with enough left over for another person. My wife and I each had lots left over. One of the twins had a kid meal and took 2/3 of it home. The other one took half of his home. My daughter also had leftovers of her vegetarian fajitas.  These folks have an extensive menu, and they will make adjustments or substitutions for you. They want you to be happy and full, and they are very attentive to your needs. We had a \"water glass accident\" (spill), and they were on it immediately.  We will definitely return to this place. It's authentic, very reasonably priced, and festive. We will have to remember to be starving when we get there...  Do print a Google Map or use your GPS to find it the first time, though. It is in a strip shopping center just off Independence freeway, but is best accessed from the neighborhood streets off of Sharon Amity, just West/South of Independence.",

I went with my brother-in-law who is from Mexico and this is also his favorite mexican restaurant.  Not just for the food, but for the excellent service.  The entire wait staff works together, and like Tony said in his review, they are willing to make dishes that aren't on the menu.  If you go, you should try the Horchata, this is a mexican rice based drink that compliments any Mexican dish.    I was surprised with a song and dance from the wait staff that was both hilarious and embarrassing in the same.  My waitress put a sambrara on my head and sang to me as my face turned as red as a tomato.  Anyways, I would recommend everything about the place (just don't let them know that it's your bday)!",

Being a native Carolinian, I'm not the best judge of authentic Mexican cuisine, but this food is full of flavor without being overpoweringly spicy.  I'm glad that the lacking decor turns people away so I always have a seat!",

    "text": "Hubby being from Houston and me eating a lot of mexican/texmex while we were dating.....mexican food anywhere else is like a joke. Unless you are willing to try cantinas # something. Now those are always the best! Anyway there are days when Hubby gets really nostalgic and craves Mexican food so we decided to try Las Margarita because it was close to home and it always looks packed when we drive by.  The service was awesome! we got so many refills of chips and salsa. The salsa was made fresh. The Margarita was really yum too. I ordered the chicken tacos and hubby got the fajitas. Both of us were satisfied with the dishes we ordered. Maybe there are other mexican restaurants that are more authentic out there but this place sure beats the typical on the border or chevys. But if you are about the ambiance rather than the food then this is not the place for you. Its a huge restaurant with great service and good food. Order a pitcher of Margarita and Enjoy!",

    "text": "Las Margarita is one of the better mexican restaraunts there in Charlotte. I came across this restaraunt while driving up Independence Blvd from downtown Charlotte its kind of hidden in this strip mall, so you have to slow down before you miss the entrance to this strip mall. When you enter you can smell the aromas of the food right away, this place makes you feel like your in Mexico even if you have not been before. the staff is very friendly and gets you seated right away. They offer the salsa and chips which is very good and they both taste very fresh. I ordered a chicken enchilada with the rice and black beans on the side which came up fast and hot. I yamed it up because I enjoyed it and I was hungry. This place is straight authentic mexican food, the people the atmosphere from the customers to the people it seem like everybody was mexican. This is a must eat spot if your passing thru Charlotte NC. By the way its not a fancy spot but its clean and comfortable and the prices are good for the amount of food that they give you.",
