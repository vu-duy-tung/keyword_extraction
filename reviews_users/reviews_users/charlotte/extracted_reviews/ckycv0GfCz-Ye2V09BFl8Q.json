The bobas were hard and just not good, taste like old bobas that's been sitting around. Not worth it at all. If you like your teas you get from other oriental places that you do in CLT then stick with those places and so you won't be disappointed like me. The next weekend I had to go to Super G mart and for the milk tea I always do from the Hong Kong place inside the store, I'm never disappointed there.",

My coconut milk tea did not taste like coconut at all. In fact, it taste like Thai Tea. Booooooooo! We got an egg roll too, but it was expensive. $1.50 for a single egg roll. Not worth it and only had to get it because there's was a $10 limit to use debt/credit card or it'll charge you a fee.  By the way, bubble teas are about $4.25 each.  Since it just opened, I will give it another try down the road. For now, that's my opinion. Will give an updated review once I go back in a few weeks/months.",

The milk options are interesting, I think the red beans which is a classic Asian dessert (the OGs always love) pairs better with that. Wow the options seem endless & they are worth coming back for. Exciting plus to have been shocked to find out the owners are fellow Cambodians like my family!! The mom & son are superb!!! Very sweet, kind,  patient, happy & helpful!! Please come support them and put together your genius combinations of yumminess! Honestly if you don't like yours, I bet you just didn't put the right stuff together, so try again, practice makes perfect! They came all the way from Philly! Thank you for being here!! Oh yeah & we had the chicken egg rolls (the 4 pc not 5) which we thought were surprisingly long and good, comes with sweet chili sauce. My mom loved the dumplings, filled real nice and full.",

The \"egg buns\" caught my attention but quickly disappointed me when I realized it's just a freaking waffle with no syrup.   I haven't found a good Boba spot yet but I'm still hopeful.

I think that there have been some boba shops come through Charlotte, but never lasting. I hope this one stays, but wished that it was closer to home. I can't complain.  Pretty standard boba, would definitely come through and just try bubble tea in general. Quickly isn't the best ever boba ever, but it's still boba. I had the black milk tea, but the only problem with Quickly is that you can't change their sugar levels and all of that. It's basically what you order is what you get. The drink had a pretty high level of sugar, but it's alright. Look, Quickly isn't the best, but it's still bubble tea and I'm definitely a fan considering Charlotte has always lacked bubble tea shops. Until more shops open, this one will be a go to if I ever have a bubble tea itch and I'm in town.",

Overall great refreshing boba drinks are served here!   Service: Now this is why I gave 3 instead of 4 stars... The people are always nice and respectful however whenever I ask for extra boba, it's never extra boba which I pay extra for. So if you do like extra boba make sure to emphasize it a bit. Also I feel as if sometimes the cashiers don't understand me (nothing against their accent) however I don't want to waste their time and mine by making/receiving the wrong drink.   Inside Quickly: The interior is very clean and I like the colorful chairs and tables. The floor looks clean. And most importantly the area where they make the drinks look clean.   Price: Really depends on what size you order but it's reasonable. I order a medium which usually comes out to $4.50 plus tax. Which would make the large about $6.00 plus tax.   Wish I could have given them 4 stars, but I do an overall review of EVERYTHING. So because of the service issues I had to bring it down to 3. But the boba itself is great but I had so leave a honest warning as to how the service can be tricky.",

There's so many additonal things on the menu! There's a dessert menu that wasn't there before and more snacks. They also have a very extensive flavor menu to choose from and 4 different ways you want the drink. You can also add up to 3 different toppings in the drink.  I've tried the fried oreos which just came fresh out of the fryer and absolutely delicious. Their drinks are okay but the flavor is a little more toned down than Fruiticup hence me taking off one star. However I still think this place is much better than Fruiticup. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "This was my first boba tea, and I was excited.  The place was immaculately kept.  I noticed an impressive 97.0 sanitation score.  The woman behind the counter was helpful and patient.  Truthfully though, it was hard to understand everything she said due to her accent.    After she carefully went over the different options I settled on a small pineapple/coconut boba.  The tea was amazingly cold and delightfully refreshing.  Not too sweet...  A unique taste that I loved.   I liked that each tea was made fresh to order, and the way they sealed the top of the cup so no spills!  The wide straws were novel and just right for consuming this drink.  The first few sips were great, until it just wasn't anymore.    There were so, so many boba that it interfered with the enjoyment of the drink.  At one point the boba seemed to be replicating itself.    With each sip this experience morphed into a high-end drink nightmare!  The boba tasted like chewy pebbles of goo that expanded in my stomach.   It caused my stomach to ache.  I began discarding the boba into a napkin until I finally gave up and tossed the entire drink out.  I didn't even have 1/3 of it.  I felt wasteful but really...  No treat should be this much work!    Five dollars directly in the trash.   Will I ever drink boba again?   There is a probability. Will I request less or NO boba?   Certainly.",

My first experience of a Quickly, wasn't great. It's the one in the NE burbs of Charlotte, and the service was definitely the best part. I got a black milk tea with tapioca, and the pearls didn't taste like anything (just plastic) and the tea was very bland too, and a litte watery. I was disappointed because I hate to say it, but chains usually know how to make a good milk tea. In any case, I'll try other locations in the future, and it wasn't awful. Just not up to my standards.",
