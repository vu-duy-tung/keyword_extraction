This is a 100% authentic Colombian and Venezuelan bakery. Stuffed arepas are to die for and so are all of the items they have.  Operated by the super friendly owners.  I've lived in Charlotte for one year and have been waiting to find something like this ever since.  This will be my new second home.",

The owner is extremely friendly and kind. He would come check on my table to see if we had any questions or suggestions. The only thing I can say bothered was a strange occurrence.

My husband and I have recently moved to Charlotte and we've spent so many times trying to find a good Venezuelan spot, and finally this is IT! From the moment we went in we got greeted by a gentleman, very courteous and patient, we had no idea what to get. We finally ordered arepas and cachapas, however my husband made a switch from the chicken with avocado, to shredded beef with layered avocado. Needless to say it was devoured in seconds because it was SO good. I had a shredded beef arepa and a cachapa with cheese. The next time we went back, I ordered the cachapa with cheese and shredded beef. The food here is amazing, and I really can not begin to think that anyone else here would say otherwise. I spoke to the woman who made our food and she was so sweet and kind. They back you feel at home, and welcomed. Every time we go the food just gets better and better. If I can come here everyday, I would. Thank you Lucy's Bake & Deli!!",

One of us had the venezuelan platter and the other had the Cuban platter, the platters were pretty much the same, one was with pork and the other beef, then the rest of the platter was rice, plantains, and black beans. Platters were $9.99 so reasonable and the food was good. The staff was very nice and helpful. I will definitely go back.",

We both noticed they had many options for lunch also and Columbian food like plantains and roast meat. We wanted to try dessert but we were full. It seems like more of a deli than a bakery.  Parking in the back lot was easier than fitting into the spaces off Potter Rd. I am so excited to return for more goodies!",

After waiting in line to order for about 5-8 minutes we finally ordered. I got an arepa stuffed with chicken, cheese and avocado and my husband got the Venezuelan platter which included beef, beans, rice and plantains.   We waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. The owner could tell my husband was fading some so he brought over a complimentary bread (it had a name but the English explanation was tapioca bread) it was very good and so sweet of the owner to bring it over.   The food came out hot and was fantastic!!!!  So fresh and so well seasoned. The owner and his wife do all the cooking. They are sooo proud of their restaurant and for good reason - it's honestly excellent!!!  This little hole in the wall is SO worth the trip and the wait!!!",

Since moving to charlotte I've been on the hunt for REAL cafe con leche along with authentic latin food and I haven't been very successful.   I asked if they served cafe con leche and they assured me that they did, but then served me coffee from a Nescafe machine which is NOT how you make REAL cafe con leche. The coffee was good but it was NOT cafe con leche.   The cachapa was ok, but it was a bit soggy and sitting in water. Overall I doubt I'll return. My hunt for real cafe con leche and authentic latin food continues. Moving from Miami has set the bar very high when it comes to latin food and latin culture.",

Food is cooked with the passion and love latinos are known for. No bland menu items. Not salty either. Delicious and bursting with flavor.   Although preparations and taste of certain items are not similar to my cultural puerto rican dishes, I still devoured what I ordered with mucho gusto.   If you like a little spice, ask for their freshly made hot sauce.   Have a sweet tooth, they also bake fresh everyday fruit filled puff pastries and more.   Make it a point to try each of their fresh empanadas until you find the one your heart soars for. I hear the chicken empanada is a favorite.  Just be prepared to walk into a slice of Colombia and Venezuela where the food is cooked and tastes just like in one of their homes.  Bien provecho!",

Had Colombian breakfast platter: Arepa is a thick white corn tortilla with two over easy eggs. They are good and can fill you up, but need to season it to your taste, just imagine grit patty with eggs. They have hot sauce, and even hotter sauce, along with garlic sauce upon request. Also come with a mixture of rice, beans and shredded beef. Very good flavor, add hot sauce for spice. Cachapa is sweet corn pancake. You can have it with cheese or cachapa fascia comes with cheese and shredded beef. This is my favorite. Very good flavor with a hint of sweetness.   I had the Arepa with shredded chicken also. You can have Arepa with breakfast items also. This Arepa is like a pita made of corn flour, stuffed with whatever meat you want.   They also had a varieties of pastry to choose from. I had shredded beef empanada. Venezuela empanadas shell are made with corn flour, unlike other empanadas in other countries made with wheat flour. I like these best out of all other empanadas I have eaten around the world.  The coffees was nice a smooth. You can also have it with cinnamon, to give it a nice kick.   Definitely will be back, even if it's a 30 drive for us. Recommend!",

I ordered it because that seemed to be a popular choice at Lucy's. IT WAS DELICIOUS! Savory and a burst of flavor.  So glad I discovered this gem just 10 minutes from my house. The tres leches was also very yummy. If you've had a meal you'll need to share half or save some for later.",
