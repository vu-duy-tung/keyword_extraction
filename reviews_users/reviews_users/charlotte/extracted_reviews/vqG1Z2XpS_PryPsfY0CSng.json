    "text": "The mecca of steakhouses.. this place is amazing! The only downfall we are looking at here is the price upwards of 85-100 per person, but if you are wanting quite possibly the best steak you have ever had, with the best service you have ever had then this is the place for you. The atmosphere is perfect, a nice dimly lit large seating area with both booths and tables, making access available for everyone. The music in the background is usually light jazz which is perfect for business dinners, or just a nice meal with the significant other. I enjoy going with my friends during the Charlotte restaurant week where you can get a 3 course dinner for 30.00 and one of the entrees is a steak. overall this is quite possibly the best restaurant I have ever been to, if you like alcohol they have everything imaginable from the finest wines and liquors to the best martinis in the area. GO TO THIS PLACE ON YOUR NEXT SPECIAL OCCASION",

It's always super busy bit with our early evening reservations we didn't feel rushed through our meal at all.   The service and wine selections were phenomenal. Our glasses were always full, we didn't ever have to ask for anything and  our waitress offered excellent wine pairing selections with our dinner.   For my meal I ordered the Caesar salad, filet cooked medium well and creme brulee cheesecake for dessert.   The salad was just average. Nothing really special but the steak and cheesecake were absolutely fantastic. The steak was cooked perfectly and so tender!!! I enjoyed every single bite. And the creme brulee topping in the cheesecake was a nice spin on such a classic dessert.   I'd absolutely go again.",

    "text": "For my money, there is no steakhouse as consistently outstanding as The Capital Grille. Whether I'm in Atlanta, D.C., or Charlotte, their steaks are always cooked to perfection, their service always world class, and their wine selection second-to-none.  My wife and I recently dined at the Charlotte location during the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and for the absurdly low price of $30 a person, each enjoyed a delicious 8-oz filet, two sides and a dessert. As luck would have it, our local Restaurant Week happened to coincide with the Capital Grille's Generous Pour event, so we each enjoyed glasses of four different red wines for just $25 each. When the bill finally arrived, we couldn't believe what an incredible deal we just had!  I could go on about why The Capital Grille is far and away my favorite restaurant, but you'll have to experience it yourself to understand. There's no better place to celebrate a special occasion, take a client for a business lunch, or just enjoy a fantastic steak.",

Surprisingly the wait (with a reservation of course) was not too long and we were seated fairly quickly. The only downside to the night was being seated in a tiny back room with pretty terrible lighting and our waiter (Alex) was a little overbearing and uncomfortable.  However, the food completely made up for the atmosphere. I had an 8oz filet medium and it was AMAZING!! So juicy and perfectly cooked! I could not have imagined a better steak. Boyfriend had a 14oz New York Strip which he says is the best NY Strip he has ever had. We are both steak lovers but have become fairly picky about our steaks and these left us completely satisfied.  The wine selection was wonderful, unfortunately the red we chose was not my favorite. However that was completely our choice, not a recommendation so we take responsibility for that one. We would consider this a success and definitely a top choice for the next special occasion.",

Now granted I came during Charlotte's Restaurant Week but it's a restaurant I would try again even if it wasn't restaurant week. I got the chef's special which was the bone-in Kona crusted dry aged 18 oz NY strip topped with a shallot butter sauce. It was cooked a gorgeous medium rare. Buttery and smooth. The sauce was heavenly. I also ordered a delicious wedge salad and the creme brulee was fantastic. The sides were green beans with onions and heirloom tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Both good but I was really focused on my steak. Peter was a great server and recommended a delicious house martini that complimented my meal. Do yourself a favor and make reservations today.",

This was an experience, and I am not trying to exaggerate. Everything was superb, from the service, to the food, and the ambiance this place does not disappoint in any way.   My bestie can now calm down, I (finally!) tried the lobster mac n cheese, as it has been recommended by friends and Yelpers alike, and I must say I'm a huge fan! I usually only use the word decadent for desserts, however this dish is savory & decadent at the same time, definitely would go back for lunch to have it as a meal on it's own. Yes, it was that good.   Our steaks were cooked perfectly, we ordered a Filet Mignon & Dry Aged NY Strip Au Poivre & Couvoisier Cream, taste wise, goodness, all I can say is that these were 2 of the best steaks that we have ever enjoyed.    The service was impeccable, for me to say that, it meas a lot. I was a server in high school & college as well, so I know great service, I also know that I am a high maintenance customer, like I can easy drink 4 glasses of water with dinner, and I always find myself needing something else, extra dressing, another glass of wine, something, you feel me, and this place has excellent service, we never felt forgotten, yet never bothered either.  Desserts, wow, what can I say, other than please save room to at least share one item, and I would highly recommend the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake, I only wish that I had taken an additional slice with me, as 1 slice was not enough for this chocoholic, haha.  5 Stars all around. You must go soon!",

We had Andy as the server and he took the time to explain every item and cocktail and was overall very attentive. They butterflied my filet mignon since I ordered it medium-well. However, it was a little over cooked which was a bit disappointing since it cost over $40 for that 1 item, but all other food was very good. The sides like a baked potato or truffle fries are $11 each which is absurd since the cost for that is about $1, so you pay an extra $10 to be able to sit in their dining room and eat it!    The decor inside is very nice and definitely a place you want to take someone to impress them!  Would go back, but a meal for two was $200 so only visiting on special occasions.",

We decided to order a bottle of wine cause we were celebrating that evening. All the wines are on a tablet, which was really neat cause you could easily scroll through the bottles and filter. We ended up settling on a Zin/Shiraz blend. It was absolutely delish....I wish I got the name of it!  Since we were dining for restaurant week ($35 per person), the menu was limited. However, I would love to return cause I heard their lobster mac was fantastic! I decided on the clam chowder, 8oz filet mignon, and chocolate flourless espresso cake. My husband picked the wedge salad, ribeye (i think it was crazy big like 14 oz) and chocolate flourless cake.   Unfortunately, the clam chowder wasn't anything special. I have a huge love for chowders and this one simply didnt do anythign for me. I took a bite of my husbands salad and it was very good. Our steaks came out next. They were cooked absolutely perfectly! The filet mignon literally melted in my mouth. My husbands steak was seasoned so well. This is definitely where Capital Grille shined! The shared potatoes that came with it were perfect. Additionally, the meal came with shared green beans. I thought the green beans weren't cooked enough, but that is just a personal preference. The taste was excellent though. Lastly, the desserts. Oh my gosh, rasberries, cream, and the fudge like cake. Perfection. That dessert was spot on!  There was one small incident that I wasn't super thrilled with how it was handled. The waiter brought over our steaks and sides. In the few seconds it took me to grab my fork and knife and almost cut into my steak, my husband (and at the same time, the waiter) realized he brought over the wrong steaks. Like, our entire order was for a different table. Literally, not a big deal at all. Misstakes happen. However, without even an apology he grabbed all the plates, including the veggie sides (that come with all restaurant week meals!) and cleared our table. It was just awkward cause he made something that wasnt a big deal into a scene. Our neighbors sitting beside us literally leaned over and said they couldnt believe he did that and took the sides off the table too. Additionally, I would never complain about this, but the new steak I got was definitely not as nice looking or as large of a cut (not that it completely mattered cause I didnt even eat all my steak anyways) as the one that was accidentally served to me. Felt like I got the reject one! However, it was delicious and we just moved on.",

The four of us shared an impressive seafood tower, bone-in ribeye, creamed spinach, truffle fries, and creamed corn.  Marc made a great wine selection.

All were cooked perfectly and paired with green beans and tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Atmosphere was very nice and well maintained. Staff was very pleasant and welcoming. The food overall was terrific. I personally did not care for the green beans and wish asparagus was paired with the meal instead. For desert I had the espresso cake and they ordered the creme brulee. The cake in my opinion was much better than the pudding. I tried the pudding and was disappointed that it was not warm. I have had creme brulee heated before from other restaurants and it's much better heated. We looked at the traditional menu and saw an excellent selection. Everything looked delicious. However the prices are startling. You can get similar quality and service for 15% cheaper at other restaurants. They are definitely worth trying but be prepared to have a nice chunk of cash to spend.",

    "text": "I've never had bad food or a bad experience at Capital Grille.  However, it's very pricey so be ready to plop down some serious cash or whip out the plastic with comfortable space between your credit limit and current balance.    The scallops wrapped in bacon are great, as are the garlic mashed potatoes, steak and seafood.  I agree with another reviewer who says to order something other than steak if you want...it will still be tasty.   Tips: - If you work uptown and are having dinner at Capital Grille, leave your car where it is and walk; otherwise, you'll have to pay again to have it parked.  - Reservation is probably a good idea. - Good for company/team dinners.",

The service was impeccable from the moment we stepped into the restaraunt. I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded but there was an ice storm brewing outside, which could have forced people to stay in. Even though I begrudgingly went to Cap Grill because my boyfriend wanted a steak, I enjoyed myself just as much as he did. I had the salmon salad, which our waiter recommended, and was delicious, and my boyfriend had the filet, which he has never been disappointed by at any Cap Gill. The service stands out at Cap Grill and, as long as you're in the mood for deliciously prepared but simple dishes, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I would give this place 2 1/2 stars but that wasn't an option so it got 3 instead.  The only reason it got 3 stars was because the desert, proscuitto wrapped mozarella & lobster mac & cheese were very good.  One thing to note is that the proscuitto wrapped mozarealla is served hot.  I thought it was going to be cold and one of the reasons I ordered it is that I thought it would be a little lighter.  As it turned out, it was very heavy.  Tasted good, though.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Speaking of something that wasn't what I expected, if I had to rate this place based on the steaks alone, I would have given it a one.  Frankly, I've gotten a better steak from Whole Foods.  Also, the steak came with a pool of steak sauce on the side.  If I'm paying 47 bucks for a steak, I don't want any sauce near it.  My wife's filet actually had some sauce on top of it.  Personally, I would have asked for one without sauce.  The menu doesn't mention anything about sauce, they should really let you know about it in advance.",

Wagyu Carpachio - awesome. thinly sliced and generous portions Lobster Bisque - lots of lobster in the soup. not as creamy as most would have it. ++ for me Shrimp Cocktail - got 5 shrimps. and they were big shrimps. very fresh and juicy. Sesame crusted Ahi Tuna. if you dont like sushi, dont try it. difficult to cook. tasted a little bland to me IMO.  Porterhouse_ excellent cut. nothing else needed on top of the steak. cooked perfectly.   Night ended with a complimentary chocolate cake. awesome cake!.  Thank you Capital Grille!",

The was the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Charlotte and continues to be a place to go for dinner or dessert after dinner somewhere else. For me, the best cheesecake in town. Great patio for outdoor seating. Great open bar with top notch service. This is a place to indulge for dinner and wine. Both menus are impressive. Open kitchen concept makes the feeling in the restaurant a little more lively.  The Delmonico steak is great as well as the filet. Depending on the size of the lobster tail that night, getting it as an appetizer is a sure way to make the bill skyrocket, but hey, we only live once!",

I hate the fact that most upscale steak restaurants ignores the needs of patrons who want to watch their waistline. My husband likes steak, BUT--- I want to eat healthy.  So, how about some healthy options, Capital?   I had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk. There entree-sized salad was fit for a mouse that had already eaten...I  left hungry! Ugh. Plus---my special order came out wrong and I had to (once again) watch my husband eat while I fantasized about how many carbs were in the napkin... Oh, I won't be coming back.

A Manhattan here tastes like a Manhattan.  The entrees are excellent.  The sides, a little disappointing given how good the entrees are.  I'm a dessert person and often find myself disappointed with the standard desserts at steakhouses, but the chocolate espresso cake with raspberries and whipped cream didn't disappoint.

I love the atmosphere, I love the steak, I love the Stoli Doli martinis, I love the cheesecake with the torched topping...what can I say, I'm a sucker for a great steak accompanied by great service.   I only come to Cap Grille for special occasions, as it's certainly no cheap meal. Hubs and I can easily spend $150-$200 for a meal here (includes a few courses and adult beverages). Hence, during Charlotte's Restaurant Week(s) we always try to schedule in an affordable, delicious meal.   The service here has been nothing but extraordinary every time I've walked in - whether I was just having a martini at the bar or a full-fledged meal al fresco. I'm a big fan of the shrimp cocktail - pretentious, sure, but it's composed of colossal shrimp and the perfect spicy cocktail sauce. Their filet is just so incredible, they have always cooked it exactly to my preferences, save one particular undercooked occasion which they immediately remedied with swift service and a very sweet apology.   As for their sides, the asparagus w/Hollandaise, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin will certainly stop your heart literally and figuratively. And last but not least, their desserts are just delectable. Per my opening remarks, their cheesecake is out of this world. It's a round, rich cheesecake with a semi-torched top and served with a smattering of fresh berries. YUM.   Every time I leave Capital Grille I feel very full but very, very happy!",

    "text": "Capital Grille is definitely going to put a large hurting on your wallet but I will say that it ranks the best in that class of high dollar restaurant that I have had in a long time! It was awesome food to say the least.   I ordered the Caprese Salad for the starter, the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year Aged Balsamic, and the creme brulle for dessert.   The salad was simple but amazing. You could definitely tell the mozzarella was made in-house and the balsamic gave it a good punch.   The steak was out of this world and if it was humanly possible to eat the bone also, it probably would have happened! I had it cooked medium-rare to perfection. Side note: when eating at a \"real\" steakhouse make sure to ask what their temperatures mean. Many places I go, I order it rare but at higher end places, they are going to cook it the way they say...and rare means cold red center.   For desert the creme brulle was great and had some fresh berries on top.  It is hard in my opinion to mess this dish up but they delivered very well!  Overall, a great dinner - I almost had to roll myself out of there.  Would I eat here on a typical night out for dinner?  No.  The price is prohibitive.  But for a nice business dinner and/or personal event.  It is top notch.  I wouldn't even consider going to Ruth Chris in comparison!",

Ugh just let me do it please? If I dont eat everything, Its not that the food inst good its just i will finish eating and stop eating. If my friend and I haven't eaten anything in 5 mins it means WERE DONE. thanks  The food was fine. Its nothing I haven't seen anywhere else. For an appetizer we had the pan-fried calamari. It was okay, the wrapped lemon was a cute touch but i mean honesty the calamari was too battered and not crisp enough. For an entree I had the Sushi grade tuna. It was cooked perfectly. THe sauces were fun but not one that i completely loved. I had a side of assperagus and it was amazing. I always seem to get the overcooked asperagus but this time they were perfect and served with hollandaise.   I dont think for the price I would come back. Not worth it but I guess this place is perfect for those who wanna flaunt money",

We opted to sit outside as the dining room seemed very loud and we didn't want to struggle to have a conversation.  Our waitress was knowledgeable about the gluten free options. We started with the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. The \"croutons\" (rather large flat pieces of toast) were served on a separate plate for the guys to enjoy. My husband and his coworker ordered the bone in filet while I opted for the ny strip.  We all ordered our steaks medium.  We received rare, medium rare and medium well.  Definitely a downer for a steak house, but not a deal breaker.  Our sides were the au gratin potatoes (minus the topping to keep it GF), asparagus with lemon mosto and the roasted brussel sprouts.  The potatoes were awesome but those watching their salt intake would want to avoid this one. For dessert, the guys opted for the molten chocolate cake and I ordered the flourless chocolate \"cake\".  The guys LOVED their dessert. My dessert DEFINITELY did not disaapoint! It was nice to have a different GF option to try.  Our overall GF experience was great.  Service was slow at times, but friendly. I would definitely eat here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good gluten free dining experience.",

August of 2018 we were here before a show and a friend ordered one of their steaks. First time it came out overcooked and bland. The 2nd time it was similar so my friend decided not to continue with it. Meanwhile I was wrestling with my salmon dish which was a hair away from being mediocre; something I could make at home (mine would have been more succulent and seasoned). Last night, 6 of us were here again for dinner and 3 of us had to send our dishes back; shrimp cooked like rubber and 2 roasted chicken dishes looked and tasted like someone put the chicken in the oven from the package; roasted it and put it on a plate!! No seasoning at all & the smell was gamey. The manager came over apologizing profusely, replaced the shrimp and ordered a buffet of their delicious desserts (the chicken smell made us nauseous & we didn't want a reorder). I am giving 2 stars because the service was excellent.  So we have decided to stop coming here for awhile until they improve on their cooking staff because we really like Capital Grille.",

We love dining out and this place was perfect because it isn't a place we'd go to every weekend. When reserving our table I mentioned that we'd be celebrating his birthday and they were ready for us!  We ordered the lobster and crab crab cakes, I had the surf and turf, he had the porterhouse steak and we shared the brussel sprouts. Everything tasted amazing. If I could've shoved those brussel sprouts in my purse I would've. They really were amazing! And his steak was one fit for a King. He enjoyed every bite, and enjoyed the bites he shared with me.  After dinner, he was presented with a complimentary dessert with \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate. It was a very nice presentation.  Here's where the 5 stars come in...when we first walked in the door we were greeted so warmly. While being shown to our table, every person we passed said hello, I mean EVERYONE! At one point, a manager came over to our table, said Happy Birthday, and engaged in small talk. Our waiter was also extremely helpful and pleasant. It felt as if everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. Now, it's not as if we walked in their wearing crowns or a birthday sash, so I'm thinking this...IS WHAT THEY DO!

    "text": "Imagine having your hopes up to enjoy a nice fine dining experience on a Tuesday afternoon only to be let down by the service and timelessness of the service. I arrived at The Capitol Grill downtown Charlotte NC around 7:15 and was seated by 7:30. I ordered my food bc I knew EXACTLY what I wanted. I ordered 1 glass of wine, Caesar salad, lolly pop lamb chops, and cream spinach. I recieved my food 1 HOUR LATER. As I sat there, I tried to exercise paitence but almost fell asleep waiting on my food  and when my food FINALLY arrived, I was too sleepy to enjoy my food so I requested them to packaged it to go. I expresses my dissatisfaction to the manager and he gave me a smirk and said it's because we had a very busy schedule and graduations going on which caused the kitchen to be backed up. At no point , dis someone check on me and to give me an excuse of kitchen staff backed up is NO EXCUSE. IM NOT TO BE BLAMED FOR LACK. I RECEIVED A BILL FOR 85.00! SO after paying a 15.00 ubar bill, I considered this a 100.00 date with myself! I think I would have enjoyed it more if I went to McDonald's, at least I would have had my food before an hour. This is not acceptable and I only will tell anyone who plans to dine at this Restuarant to be prepared to wait 2 hrs to be seated and served!  I deserve a better explanation why such a Restuarant would present itself as fine dining and make the customer pay for slow and inconsiderate service.",

They tend to be heavy handed on the dressing and seasoning. So if you don't like your salad overly drenched, tell the staff that you want them to go easy on the dressing or have them put the dressing on the side.  Obviously, they serve up good quality steaks. They also have delicious risotto, chicken & a killer crab cake sandwich. Their burger is also neck-to-neck with the best burger in Charlotte.",

Just a note if, which I doubt,  any of the management team at this Capital Grille is reading, I reached out to the manager of this location several weeks ago before moving forward with this review and received zero response, ZERO RESPONSE. That's unacceptable. The evening we dined here it was 3 of us and we were to eat here then go to the show across the street. Appetizer was the shrimp and it was overcooked, the server went to get us another one and it too was overcooked. I understand shrimp can be difficult but this is the Capital Grille not Applebee's. Daughter and I had the surf and turf and both steaks were not cooked correctly, both overcooked. The lobster on mine was actually good, my daughters' was not as good. Wife had a salad but the chicken was chewy. I mentioned this to the manager on duty but he didn't seem the least bit interested as the place was very busy with Halloween parties everywhere in the uptown area. Our bill was pushing $500, including the wine and we left there hungry. Like I said earlier, unacceptable. The first couple of times weren't quite as bad as this one but they were just \"meh\". For this kind of money they are charging I want much better than \"meh\", not to mention I reached out first for them to attempt to make this right somehow, which no one cared to reciprocate. Too bad.",

He was attentive and thoughtful the whole time. The jumbo lump crab cocktail was crazy good. It was just a bowl of jumbo lump crab with a seafood mustard on the side! It was delectable. I expected dull normal cocktail sauce and a few pieces of crab. It was far better than that. It was a feast!  The steaks were amazing as well. I had the bone in filet- which seemed part filet and part ribeye and was perfectly done. And my wife had the lobster and sliced filet. Once again, done to perfection. We had Brussels sprouts with bacon on the side, caramelized and crispy perfection as well. For desert we had an amazing coconut cream pie. It was decadence defined. Great job Capital Grille, and thank you David!",

Our reservation was for 1830, an there was absolutely no wait to get to our table. We were seated at a private booth, which was decorated with hearts, and topped with a beautiful card. Our waiters, Joe and Denise, were incredible. We were given excellent recommendations by them, and best of all, they took the time to stop and get to know us. We were also given complementary flutes of champagne, which was excellent as well.   The bread basket had a vast array of different breads and rolls to choose from. The shrimp cocktail appetizer had the biggest and most tender shrimp I've ever eaten. My cocktail, the bohemian, was light and delightful. For the main course, I chose the 14 oz dry-aged New York strip, while my husband went with the salmon. Each entree was Cooke to perfection. The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare), and the portion was well worth the price. Finally, we were graciously given a dessert to share in honor of our anniversary. The plate had \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate, and featured a decedent cheesecake and flourless chocolate espresso cake. Our meal was simply delicious.   The overall feel, ambience, and staff at this establishment is spectacular, bad I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone celebrating a special occasion, or simply want a wonderful night out.",

Great service and I had the same waiter that served me previously.  He was knowledgeable in the wine and the menu.  I ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse steak since it has 2 types of steak in one.  On one side is the tenderloin filet and the other side is the NY Strip Steak.  The steak did not disappoint, but I prefer the NY Steak over the tenderloin filet so I might order just the Dry Aged NY Steak next time I come here.  I also ordered a wine to go with the steak (Hess 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon).  For sides, I order the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Soy Glazed Brussels Sprout and both were delicious.

My husband got the coffee crusted steak with shallot butter and said it was amazing. I had the sliced filet with mushrooms, onions and fig sauce.

He even packed the over cooked steak for us to take home since both my sister and uncle ordered their meat well done.   The food was as good as the service,  I ordered the sliced filet over a bed of mushrooms and my aunt who is not a steak eater, thoroughly enjoyed her herb roasted chicken (I tasted it too, it was juicy and perfectly seasoned.) Make sure you save room for dessert!  The special was carrot cake, about 4 layers of moist spicy goodness layered between not too sweet cream cheese frosting. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was my favorite, its gluten free snd extremely rich, definitely for sharing.  The hazelnut chocolate cake was alright, another huge portion definitely enough to share.",

It was quite a busy night when I walked in this dimly lit restaurant with very prestigious decor.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.  We walked right past the local banking community at the bar.  The service was awesome, very attentive, but not quite stalking.  I felt I was splurging enough, so laid off the booze, but pretty credible wine selection.  The onion loaf bread was great.  Me and my date each had different salads, I had the Cesar which had mediocre quality Parmesan shavings on top.  The other was a basic chef's with a champagne vinaigrette.  Was good, nothing to write home about.  Then came the steaks.  We both ordered medium rare(as YOU should)  The tournedos with morel crust were raw in the middle but still pretty tasty.  Very subtle on the morel.  My kona rubbed sirloin was a little past medium.  $42 steak that wasn't even cooked right, WOW!  Decent flavor, but I could easily cook a better steak with a good beef an iron skillet and above average salt.  The sides lacked luster.  Just had some potatoes and greens.  Then came desert, SO GOOD.  We had a cheesecake and a flan of sorts.  Both were amazing.  They were pretty much the only reason that I didn't complain about the meal.  All in all, it was restaurant week and I know they just push people through, but I was thoroughly disappointed.",

Which we made sure the server and restaurant knew about, nothing above and beyond or even \"special\" was done or offered.  (Except a little confetti on the table)  Things started with being handed a huge wine list on a tablet with no guidance - then no personal assist from the sommelier, just the server asking them a brief question for us.    Excessively seasoned (fire hot), appetizer.  Almost inedible for a few of us at the table.  I suspect the use of a complementary voucher to be the culprit for that.   Then being served the wrong steaks and having to switch them ourselves at the table.   Once the steaks were settled, they seemed very well prepared and were enjoyed.   Onward to addressing one of the party members by the wrong gender.  Apologizing of course, but still uncomfortable.   Another of our party ordered the pan seared tuna - it was the worst cut of tuna possible.  Stringy, difficult to bite and without being given a steak knife it was almost impossible to cut. (The meal was not sent back because of the occasion and not wanting to make a fuss)  We ended our meal with burnt coffee and what turned out to be delicious desserts.   The price, the occasion and the fact we went for dinner, not lunch, added up to the assumption that this would be a wonderful evening.  It turned out mostly mediocre.  I honestly have had a better time and better food, for a more reasonable price at local/neighborhood bars/resturaunts.  Do not fall for the hype. Try a small local fine dining restaurant.  You and your party will thank you for it!",

We had both the lobster crab cakes and shrimp cocktail for appetizers. Very delicious. Just the right spice and temperature. For our main course my wife had the salmon and I had the night's special steak. My wife enjoyed her salmon but did have to add salt which I found a bit unusual since she rarely does that. My steak was cooked to perfection and our sides of Sam's mashed potatoes and asparagus were also prepared to our liking. I can find nothing but great things to say about the quality of food. The only thing keeping me from giving me The Capital Grille five stars is the service. It struck us as being rude when we were at the reception station and the host told one of the wait staff to \"go sit these two\". Not really what I was expecting from a place such as this. Our waiter was \"Ok\". Nothing special. He was semi-attentive but as we were having our first sips of our after dinner drinks he brought us the check. Really? Do you want us to leave or do you want us to sit and spend some more money.? It was Halloween and its not like the place was slammed full.  Call me picky but if I am dropping $250 for dinner then I would expect that the service equal my expectations. I do want to give The Capital Grille a big Thank You for going the extra step of setting up our table for our anniversary. My wife was thrilled. Thank you!",

    "text": "Service and steak fell short of expectations. No doubt this is a nice restaurant but our server was not attentive enough. She was no where to be found when we were ready to order and ready to pay. She did bring our wines out very quickly and made sure our glasses were filled. That I do appreciate.  The steak, both mine and 2 other were *bleh**. I had the filet mignon at medium which was cooked to the correct temp. But it lacked flavor. My friend had the sirloin and it too lacked flavor. We were both expecting big bold beefy flavor but it just wasn;t there. I think a burger king beefburger had more beefy flavor. The sides were great! Loved the spinach and mushroom.  Finally, the cream brulee was very good.  So, I came for steak and I did not get good steak here. I will not be back. Should have ate at Ruth Chris instead.. and its just 4 blocks the other way..",

We had a large group so we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited on our party to arrive. We ended up enjoying dinner in their private dining room- hello fabulous service and an exclusive feel. This may have not been the best steak I ever had but some of my friends were kind enough to share and their entrees were stand outs. Salads and soups were just so-so but they do their meat right. Dessert was also amazing. Several months later I still remember the service and experience here. Highly recommend if you are rolling in the dough or looking for a special evening.",

    "text": "This place is terrible. We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again.   Our waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date.   The main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.",

    "text": "What a truly wonderful restaurant all the way around. It's rare I feel like I've been \"wowed\" when I go out, but The Captial Grille had that effect and they did so in a way that seemed effortless and second-nature.  We were lured in after the recent Elite event (and actually made our dinner reservations within an hour of the event). The ambiance is exquisite without being extravagant, with many formal-looking portraits, iron, and a wealth of masculine darkly-stained wood.  The kitchen was spot-on during our visit - not a single thing came to the table that wasn't outstanding. We both started with the bacon clam chowder - smokey and rich. My entree was the filet Mignon, a timeless classic (and a personal favorite). I ordered mine medium rare: my first experience in Charlotte where my steak was brought to me a True medium rare. It's a tender cut that the chefs worked wonders with. A had the dry-aged Kona crusted sirloin - his was equally amazing with explosive flavors. Dessert brought chocolate espresso flour-less cake. Exceptionally rich and decadent - the perfect end to the meal.  As an experienced oenophile, I am in heaven at The Capital Grille. The wine selection has no comparison in the area - many, many phenomenal producers represented from around the globe, a survey of the best-of-the-best in wine. We mentioned we had attended for the summer Generous Pour event earlier and paid for it again tonight. This time, though, the server turned it into a guessing game: we'd order one, he'd bring two, seeing if we could identify the mystery wine from the list he recommended with our food.   Speaking of the service, TCG is in a league of their own in the area. The staff, who had or reservation, greeted us by name at the door and at our table. The manager recognized us from the week before and made it a point to stop by and welcome us and to wish us well at the end of the evening. Down to the very smallest detail of folding your napkin if you need to leave the table during your meal, this team embodies every stellar trait of the service industry.  While The Captial Grille is not in the budget for a regular meal (yet), they are now my first choice for a venue to celebrate and to show off everything Charlotte has to offer.",

    "text": "Somehow my review got moved to the Yelp event page. Reposting here...  Every once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.  I know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.  I'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.  Ok, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.  In case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge.",

As and added bonus the waiter pointed out that the DT Suh from the Miami Dolphins was at the next table over and when he got done I went and asked for his autograph and he was very nice and gave it to me.  This place was incredible from the moment we walked in to the moment we left.  It is on the very expensive side but well worth every dime we paid.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting who wants an upscale atmosphere and a great top notch dinner.",

To Start the evening off there weren't any seat left inside the restaurant so we were escorted to a dining room outside the lobby. There were so many terrible things that occur that evening where do i begin. First the ceasar salad was the worst salad i have ever had it taste like a 2 day old bag salad you get at your local grocery store. it wasn't fresh, i was missing courton in mine. Next it time for the entree.  2 of my  guest ask for a med-rare skin their  steak came   super well done . so dry i didn't know if i was filet mignon or A cheap dry roast beef.  She returned her and it came back out much better . I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth. I would have expect better quality of food for a 4 star restaurant.  She got her meal for free due to all the mistakes. but i didn't get antything for my bloody chicken. I will never go here again. :-(",

    "text": "I have to be honest... when I first heard the name of this place, I thought it was going to be bar food or something pretty typical. My honey decided to surprise me for restaurant week and this was the place of choice. I was actually a bit disappointed when he told me since my first idea of their selection was initially incorrect.   He told me to dress up, and I was thinking he was crazy or something... dress up for bar food?? What? Ok... I have to admit, I'm pretty stubborn, so uttering the words, \"You were right\" as we walked in the door of this beautiful place wasn't easy. I felt as if I were an actress in the silver screen era with the beautiful artwork, and almost royal looking furnishings. The lights were set to a low romantic level and the place was buzzing with a sophisticated crowd.   When we walked in and I got over the romantic candle lights flickering lazily in the dining area. The hosts and hostess were super attentive and We told them we had reservations. We were told there was still going to be a wait.,which I figured may be the case for restaurant week. They had some chairs to the side so we sat to the wayside, and watched a couple people get sat before us who came in after us. I went up and asked them for a menu and they realized we had been there for a bit. The hostess was great, and she put us at the top of the list to be sat. She apologized and we were fine. After we sat down we ordered, and the food came out in great time.   He ordered the 8 oz Kona Parmesan steak for his meal and I had the Salmon. The sides that came with these meals were spinach and mashed potatoes. Now, I've said that many places were good, and I've given many 5 star reviews, but MY GOD I think they should make an exception for even more stars for some places.   When I took that first taste of my salmon... time stopped as my taste buds exploded. I thought it couldn't get any better, and then I tried the potatoes... If foodgasms were real. This is it folks. I'm serious... Capital Grill has the BEST food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I could have wept from the amazingness on my palate. The salmon was so juicy and perfect. The potatoes... oh those potatoes... I could write an entire review on those alone. Perfect.   Now the most amazing part and quite possibly the best customer service I have ever experienced in my life. We got our bill and my honey had ordered an All American and then changed his mind and switched to a B&B, both drinks ended up being on the bill. We weren't upset by it at all, but a manager came over when he saw us looking around for our waitress.   He asked if everything was ok, and when we explained the mix up, he apologized profusely and told us he would take both drinks off of our bill!! We told him he didn't have to do that because we did have the one drink, but he insisted and said it would make his night to make this right for us. WOW!!! We were amazed!!  There is seriously nothing negative I can say about this place, and I think it'll be a great place for any special occasion. Hmmm... my birthday IS right around the corner... :)",

The shrimp cocktail were a bit tough to the bite.  Loved the wedge salad; there is something refreshing about the crispness of iceberg and their blue cheese dressing is not over powering with cheap blue cheese. I ordered the Dry aged porterhouse; very tender but there was a strip of gristle through the sirloin, making a third of the steak extremely chewy.

The service here is impeccable and done mostly with a smile. My waiter was a bit too serious for his own good but everyone else was lovely.    Food wise, oh my, my, MY! Yum! I had the 14 oz. Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin - with shallot butter, which was far more steak then I'd normally ever have in one sitting but wow! It was so good I couldn't even leave a bite left on my plate. Cooked to perfection the meat with sharper taste of the shallot butter just melted in my mouth. It cames with the Sam's Mashed Potatoes & Fresh Creamed Spinach.  The potatoes were really tasty but the spinach I could've done without. This is easily enough food for two!  Ordered a Stoli Doli to go with my meal. It's the signature drink at Capital Grille and definitely worth having more than once.   And the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake! Oh the cake... If people could live without sex by eating this cake, they'd be fat on flavor and taste of this amazing cake. By far one of the best flourless cakes I've ever had, rich in flavor, with the consistency of fudge.",

First, the service is amazing.  Steve L. was our waiter and the guy was pure class.  He was extremely attentive and went through the menu with us since it was our first time at the restaurant.    I have the 14oz strip steak (medium) and it was cooked perfectly.  Tender enough to cut with a fork. My wife got the salmon and said that it was cooked perfectly and had amazing taste.  We got two sides, Truffle Fries and Cream Corn.  The corn had a smoky flavor to it and was awesome.  The fries were ridiculously good.  Not sure how they fry them up, but they were so crunchy on the outside, but nice and soft on the inside.  One thing though, the sides are not HUGE, but a large portion, perfect for two people to share.   Overall, this is definitely a 5 star experience worth the price.  Kudos to Steve and team on an awesome restaurant!!  I will for certain visit again when in town for business.",

Food was amazing and her unassuming knowledge and recommendations for wine by the glass will be remembered. We were  on a short overnight stay, and just wanted a good relaxing meal at the bar. The perfect martini, along with staff that were professional and not pretentious. Our bartender, who was married to a sommelier, gave us a few pointers on identifying a good wine. This was done in a very genuine humble fashion. When passing through Charlotte we will be back. We were there 3 January 2016 awaiting a new grandchild.",

    "text": "Echoing a few other reviewers, capital grille is a five star place that should really be more a three star. The food is nothing special for how much you pay for it. My friend and I came for dinner to catch up while he was in town, we were quickly seated at an open table in the bar area which was nice. Our waitress was kind of aloof at times, she'd be very attentive for a short period of time and then nowhere to be found for a long period of time in between. We shared a few starters that were all unremarkable, i will say their bread basket definitely didn't disappoint. I had the sliced filet with mushrooms and a fig sauce, my filet was ordered to be medium rare plus, and it came out barely medium rare. The middle pink wasn't even warm. The dish was definitely way more on the sweeter side than I anticipated. My friends meat was cooked to correct temperature though. Our sides again were nothing to write home about. The cheesecake was tasty, and I got a cappuccino that had had about 2-3 inches of foam on it that I had to scoop out to get to the barely lukewarm espresso. All in all, I feel like capital grille is becoming the Olive Garden of fine dining steakhouses, the quality seems to be going down as they are trying to maybe appeal to a wider base of customers? Not really sure, but there are def so many other legit steakhouse options in Charlotte that are better quality and worth the $$$$$$",

She was very knowledgable about the menu and always knew the right time to come check on us. We started with the shrimp cocktail the shrimp was delicious.  Next, we each had a salad. I got the spinach bacon salad and my father got the Caesar salad. Both were very good. Only complain was the spinach salad was heavy in the onion.  Next our entrees came. My father had the Dry Ages NY strip au poi er with courvoisier cream cooked medium rare. He liked it but his only complaint was the massive amount peppercorn on top. Not bad, just excess. He had to scrape most of it off. I had the sliced filet mignon with cipollini onions and wild mushrooms cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly and I loved the seasoning on it. We also shared the roasted fingerling potatoes since everything is al a carte.  All the staff was wonderfully pleasant. I will return and I am excited to explore more of the menu.",

Little did we know there were two major concerts in town that night. I have had occasions like this dining out where the host or hostess would be snobby about the situation. That was far from the case here. Despite the hectic, busy night we were treated very well. There were no tables available but we were offered full service dining at the bar. David, the bartender, was fantastic. We had the lobster and crab cakes along with the steak tartar. The serving sizes were larger than I expected. Both appetizers were amazing. We then ordered one entree (the veal) to split with a side of lobster Mac & Cheese.  I thought maybe we would be charged a sharing fee, but we weren't. They even split the entree for us onto two plates. Service was great. Food was great. I'd love to go back again!",

We started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio both were good.   For my entree I had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked. We had gotten 3 sides starting with the Lobster Mac N Cheese which was very good, but like my friend said there was nothing that made it OMG!! We also had the Onion Rings, and Sauteed Spinach which were also good.  We had the Creme Brulee for dessert and that was perfectly lighter than I thought it was going to be and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the dinner.  Our server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it!",

Honestly I've had a better salad at Outback or TX Roadhouse so go figure.  Had we not been with a large group celebrating a graduation the salads would have gone back, they should NEVER have come out of the kitchen they were an pitiful.

We were seated and briefed on some featured dishes. Eventually we ordered and was served. I ordered the bone in ribeye 22 oz. At first bite it was divine. Second bite it was delicious. By the third bite on I was then having an experience. A good experience! That was by far the best ribeye I'd ordered anywhere ever. I really enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere.

Confetti and a card on the table and champagne toast to begin the meal. Classy.  You pick drinks off an iPad which is fun. Drinks were very good.   We had the lobster bisque to start & it was the best I've probably ever had. Big chunks of lobster too.  I had the filet mignon as my main course & honestly it we not the best I've had. The flavor was not there for me. My husband's ribeye was good though. The au gratin and mushroom sides were delicious. Their au gratin is rich & fancy so I recommend over mashed potatoes.    They brought out a special desert for my husband, chocolate torte and a little cheesecake and they were divine. We could barely eat we were so full!   Our server Amber was amazing and made our dinner truly special. She took two pictures of us and they printed them & that was a very nice touch. Her positive spirit could make any meal enjoyable!  She was well over a 5 star server.   Great place to go for a special occasion but be ready because it's expensive.",

I was very impressed with the quality options. I ordered the filet mignon, and it was cooked perfectly (medium rare plus). We shared the lobster Mac and cheese, which was buttery, creamy, and delicious. We also shared the Brussels sprouts... so good and they were cooked with bacon. The dessert menu did have some great options, but I was stuffed by the end of the meal. I'm happy to know that this is actually a chain and can be found in many major cities.",

There are too many people who write these food reviews trying to sound like they're a foodie, or at least knowledgeable about food, and then it turns out they only go out like four times a year!  I like Capital Grille. I like it as much as Morton's. I like both better than Smith and Wollensky, Butcher and Singer, Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, and The Palm. I get my steaks medium rare. On rare occasion, such as when I order prime rib at S&W, I get it rare. This is the ONLY way to eat quality meat. USDA Prime meat (and Choice) is not going to kill you like the crap you get in supermarkets. Supermarket meat needs to be cooked well done because the supermarket butcher probably rarely washes his hands.  I've tried the sliced filet mignon, the filet \"cooked to order\", the lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail at Capital. The lobster bisque needed more lobster, but the bisque was quite good and not too strong. My filet entrees were awesome. It's amazing that they can make Choice cuts taste like Prime.",

The white tablecloth restaurant is tastefully decorated with rich, dark woods and hand painted oils throughout the dining room.  This is very fine dining and it is expensive.  Entrees start around $40.  I dined here with a party of seven and we were seated at a round table.  Our server's name was DC, and he provided excellent customer service.  We started with an appetizer tray that was outstanding!  It included Shrimp Cocktail, Oysters on the half shell, Lobster, Pan-Fried Calamari, and Lobster and Crab cakes.  All were delicious, and I especially enjoyed the Calamari.  The Calamari was cooked with hot cherry peppers that gave it a nice kick.  For my entree, DC recommended the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 8-year aged Balsmic.  The Delmonico cut is marbled and DC recommended that it be cooked medium.  Porcini is a mushroom, and it added a sweet accent to the steak.  The steak was tender, moist, and flavorful.  The group ordered three sides to share and all were excellent.  They included Roasted Cremini, Portabella, Shiitake, and Oyster Mushrooms, Lyonnaaise Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus.    As one of my fellow diners commented,  \"that was some mighty fine dining\".",

I mean, it's pretty much the same as any Capital Grille (if you've been to one before), although this location has a pretty great set-up: it's right in the middle of Uptown, with a great outdoor area. So that part's pretty great, actually. The interior is really nice, as you'd expect: lots of wood and dark colors in this stuffy, typical steakhouse setting.   In any event, we spent most of our time in the bar area, which under normal circumstance would've been cool: it's a large, open space with nice seating areas around it. The bar itself is well-stocked and the bartenders are pretty bad-ass. Again, you'd expect this much from a fancy steakhouse. When we were there it was incredibly packed; you couldn't move. And the clientele was pretty lame, but I guess that's what you'd expect.   The drink and wine selection here is amazing, though, and the appetizers were pretty darn tasty as well. As for the food, well, it's awesome--but you'll be paying a pretty heavy price to get some.",

    "text": "Capital Grille is not a place that we go often (due to it being a bit on the pricey side), but every time we do decide to splurge, it's been fantastic.   Drinks: you MUST have a stoli doli martini. So delish. That said, why not have two and really kick up your heels?  Starters: I realize that shrimp cocktail might be considered a boring choice, but with jumbo shrimp and cocktail sauce with a kick, you'll be happy you choose this route. The mixed green salad with champagne vinegarette and the tomato mozzarella salad are also great starters (but you may want to split the later as it's quite large).  Main course: I don't eat red meat, but everyone I've dined with says that Capital Grille has the best steaks around. The salmon is also very good, and the portion size ridiculous; you'll definitely have some to take home.  Sides: you must have the creamed spinach. Even if you abhor spinach you will love this dish (which tells you just how healthy it is). The asparagus and mashed potatos are also solid side choices.  Dessert (my favorite course): get the cheesecake; you will not regret it. The top is torched like creme brulee and it comes with whip cream and berries. I've also had some of their  homemade ice cream (mint), and it was very good as well. The chocolate cake is very rich, but with a bit of ice cream on top, the perfect chocolately end to your evening.  They have a very helpful slew of valet attendants out front for free parking, so defintiely plan to use them. It's just not worth it to try to find a spot on your own, especially if you're going uptown on the weekend for dinner (at which point, you should definitely make a reservation).   If you're looking for great food, service, and to save a little money, this is the place to choose when perusing the restaurant week menu. Or if you have a special occassion and feel like splurging, Capital Grille is a sure bet.",

This is actually a great deal where you can order a soup or salad, sandwich and a side.  There's only three options for each category.  I had a salad, steak sandwich and truffle fries.  My two colleagues soup instead of the salad. I had a simple field greens salad which was standard.  The sandwich was delicious and I had it done medium well which was perfect.  The truffle fries were delicious as well! My colleagues all enjoyed their food.  One of my colleagues had the lobster bisque which had generous chunks of lobster.  Service was great and though I enjoyed the food, this really is more of a business lunch or dinner place.",

I realize some steaks are unlike filets, where they are part good meat, and part fat and gristle, but I think I actually got one Capital Grille wouldn't have been proud they served.  Too bad we were in a bit of hurry and I didn't send it back.  The leftover bit I took home was almost all sub-standard.  The service was excellent, as was the rest of the meal, but when the main course is a dud, you can't help but leave disappointed.  It was my 1st visit to the highly-regarded restaurant, and I expected a 5-star experience.",

Ask for Paul the bartender-he is very competent, but also entertaining. He treated us very well, and always remembers your name.   I am a fan of the food. It is quality. I especially like the lobster mac and cheese. Despite its priceness, it is worth it. I am from Boston, and have been to Maine many times, so you can't expect to get cheap lobster in Charlotte, NC. The steaks are good-to be expected, but I was surprised at how delicious the cheeseburger was. I am a big cheeseburger fanatic and the meat is very supple and quality. The added sauces you can dip or put on the burger are a huge bonus.   The capital grille is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.",

    "text": "On a rare night out with my wife, when our daughter's in the capable hands of others, we made reservations for the Capital Grille.   Having eaten there before, courtesy of someone else's expense account, I readily knew what we were in for; a throwback to the dining days where the wait staff dressed formally (and wore name tags), and the interior was tastefully decorated in rich mahogany and imported leather, where an above-average steak can be savored and where the bartender truly knows how to mix a quality martini. In other words, this place oozes of old money, but you don't have to dress to the nines in order to enjoy service here; as long as you don't dress like you're about to attend a GWAR concert, you won't be denied service.  Our attentive waitress, Beth, could not have been more instrumental in helping us decide what to eat. I was jonesing for a good red wine, but I wasn't much in the mood to down an entire bottle on my own (my wife doesn't like red wine, and I don't like white, so that negates our wine choosing); she recommended a rich and full-bodied Rioja by the glass, so smooth and elegant that I would have enjoyed another glass were I more inclined to do so.  We started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, lightly sauteed and garnished with fresh basil and vine tomatoes. Absolutely lovely, and the prosciutto is from Parma, and not the poser variety most restaurants and delis try to pawn off on you. The crostinis were a delight as well. My wife also enjoyed a wedge salad with a tangy blue cheese dressing.  As for the main event, my wife chose the lobster and crab-stuffed shrimp; think of this as looking akin to a stuffed tomato, lightly glazed and very delicious. I went for the steak Au Poivre, rubbed with peppercorns and served with a cognac (Courvoisier?) sauce. Oh. My. GOODNESS! Tender, with a swift bite to it, thanks to the peppercorns. We shared a neatly-prepped side of sauteed spinach, and the parmesan truffle fries; this was perhaps the only disappointment, as the fries seemed to lack the prerequisite amount of parmesan so as to not make the fries taste like, well, fries.  We topped off our gastric orgy with an off-the-menu layered carrot cake, large enough for two. There was no way we could finish it, but, man, we gave it our best.  $180 for dinner? Yeah, so what? It was SO WORTH IT!!!",

For starters, the after-work vibe in there was pretty cool. The restaurant is fairly busy (read: noisy) but not so much that you couldn't carry a conversation at the bar in normal tones. And my bartender (not sure if her name was Alex or Alice) was on her A-game. The whiskey & gingers hit the spot and so did the lamb chops and potatoes au gratin. ll came out pretty quickly.

I walked by the \"chain\" steakhouses like Ruth Chris or McCormick and Schmicks to go to what I thought was a more local joint... Well I should have done more research because it's another chain. But the wait staff was incredibly nice and helped me pick out a nice aged prime rib eye. I'm seriously excited for this steak... I get the steak and it looked great.  One bite into it and unfortunately it was disappointing. It lacked salt or really any seasoning even though this was one of their specialty steaks. The wonderful waitress offered to take it back but I was not going to let a quality steak go back. I know it's still a good steak but I should not have to add flavor to steal in this price point! I jokingly asked for A-1 but would never ruin a steak like that. It was still a decent meal and the wait staff was awesome, but I did leave underwhelmed and wishing I picked a different steak house.",

    "text": "Goodness gracious, this place is friggin' amazing.    I wanted to show appreciation by taking my secretary/sounding board/second mother to CG for lunch.  That, and I've been coveting the Ribeye Steak Sandwich ever since Paul C posted Yelp pics.  Paycheck be damned, I was going to have my precious.   We started off lunch with calamari as appetizers, and in the words of Chesney: No sauce, no aioli, no problem.  It's tossed with cherry peppers at just the right ratio where you get the fresh fried calamari kicked up with a little heat.  You won't miss having nothing to dip it in, which turned out to be a plus - it's two seconds quicker that you're scarfing them down.  As for the sandwich, we've all done this in our reviews - \"OMG, like, this filet is soooo good.  Like, I would totes marry it!\" or \"Dat BBQ doe.  I'm in love.\"  This sandwich, however, doesn't warrant such amorous affection.  No, me and this sandwich, we're going for it all - double suicide... so we can be together forever and ever into eternity and infinity.  Caramelized onions, Harvarti cheese, and perfectly medium-cooked steak just hanging out between some pieces of French bread.  Hm, forever might not even be long enough.  My only regret was scheduling a meeting at 1PM forcing us to cut our lunch short.  In fact, I completely lost track of time due to good eats and good co.  Our server could sense my urgency, and quickly handled the pay process with virtually no wait time.  Impeccable service from beginning to end.  Armeen (sp?), the GM, put together one helluva team - glad I finally paid him a visit.  Speaking of paid, lunch was pricey, but well worth it.  So maybe it's a good thing that this was the first time I've been here despite working in the same building for the past three years.  Otherwise, I'd be living out of a cardboard box, taking the Charlotte Trol(LOL)ley, and picking a banjo now in front of Starbucks down the street.  Doesn't sound so bad if you got CG lunches, me thinks.  dmo out.",

Sherry Webb did an fantastic job. We will be seated in her section every time we go back.   When I asked for the dessert menu, we were greeted with an trio of desserts for my husbands birthday!

I loved the ambience.  Very old school refined steak house and I was excited for our meal.    My wife ordered the salmon and I asked for the Kona rubbed strip, medium.  The food comes out and when I cut in to my steak it is well done.  The managing partner, Armin, happens to be right there and I signal him to make him aware of what is going on.  He immediately takes it back and has the chef start a new steak for me.  As I'm waiting, I try my wife's salmon and it is absolutely delicious.   Armin asks if I would like some lobster bisque as I wait and I decline as I had already had the delicious sweet corn soup.    The new steak comes out and...it's rare and chewy to the point that I can't eat it.  I tell my waiter and say I've lost my appetite.  Clearly the staff is not happy and it's clear they are taking this personally.  Armin personally brings out a tray with three delicious desserts, comps our entire meal and hands me his business card saying he wants me back and to call him before I do so he can personally oversee to my experience.   Every restaurant has a bad night, it's how they resolve the situation that truly matters to me. They staff was tremendously gracious and I am excited to go back as I know they'll knock my socks off next time. Good job, gentlemen.",

The pros: - Service was outstanding. We couldn't take a sip of water without it being refilled. Everyone was extra cordial, the table was available earlier than our reservation, food came out very timely and on point, drink selections were well received, they even made sure to tell wait staff if was our anniversary, many of whom thereafter gave us good wishes.  The cons: - The steak was *very* good, but I've had better.  My wife got a filet that she found to be very tender and enjoyable, but it wasn't a cut above anything she's had at other top steak restaurants.  I got the Kona enfused dry aged NY strip, and I found the flavor to be too much - the coffee added an unnecessary bitterness to the steak, I wish I went for straight-up steak, as there shouldn't be a need to \"mask\" its natural flavors/  I would definitely go to TCG again, and we enjoyed our meal.. but we didn't enjoy it on par with what we paid for our meal.  For that amount, I've been to Ruth's Chris a number of times, and I found the steak more enjoyable.",

As the pictures show, this was one hell of a \"sandwich!\" It was about a 12oz STEAK sandwiched in between 2 pieces of bread. UBER flavorful, thick, juicy and prepared perfectly Med/Medium Rare. I struggled to stay awake at my desk after lunch but this was OH SO good! I mean, SUPERBLY good! And it cost $24 with tip, but well worth it!  My lunch buddy got their cheeseburger, and that also was DELICIOUS! It had to be at least 10oz, bigger than most, and completely covered in cheese.  So if you want to splurge on a great lunch, this is THE place to come! Just bring a high limit credit card! Hey like I say, you get what you pay for!",

    "text": "Had a dinner date with my best friend here during restaurant week.  I've never been to Capital Grille so I was excited to try it out.  I have only heard good things so I can't say that I wasn't a little disappointed with a few things...  I thought it would be safe to try a place like CG for Restaurant week because it is truly a chance to get more bang for your buck.  However, I am pretty sure everything switched once we said we were there for Queens Feast.  The server had been so polite and accomidating up until the point of our decision to order from the Queen's Feast.  After that moment I don't think we saw him the rest of the night, not even to bring us our food.  Seriously!  You may think I am kidding but I'm not!  He brought us bread with literally only 2 small rolls in the basket.  We had bread envy because we could see all the other tables with with bountiful bread baskets!  We figured it was because there was only two of us but the other tables only had two people as well but they had way more!  Well, we ended up asking for more bread and he never brought it.  We asked the other gentleman that was supposed to be assisting with our table as well and he brought it about 15 minutes later.    Our glasses of water were empty the majority of our time there. We both ordered Filet Mignon which was very tasty.  It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored.  We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate.  The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm.  They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen.  Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes.  The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible.  Didn't touch them.  The desserts were decent.  The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable.  It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good.  The small bite of cheesecake was good though.  Just....small.  Overall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant.  Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week?  They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us.  I guess I would say it was just overall disappointing.  The steak saved the day.  That was some darn good steak.  Not in a hurry to come back....other competitors have won my heart.",

As soon as we were seated, we were treated with celebratory champagne. I had the Gorgonzola and truffle crusted dry aged ny strip and my boyfriend had the 24 oz. dry aged porterhouse. We shared the asparagus risotto (delicious) and the lobster mac & cheese (out of this world)! Our waiter, Alex, was very knowledgeable and extremely tentative throughout or evening. We ended our meal with a special complementary anniversary dessert. This was without a doubt the best dinning experience I have ever had!!",

Our waiter Joe was one of the best we've ever had anywhere. He was extremely helpful in helping us select our orders. We took our time going through the courses and they never made us feel rushed. Our sides were out of this world and the special, tomahawk ribeye was awesome. Th surprise complimentary dessert tray at the end of the meal was a great way to top of the whole meal.

Good texture, and taste was good, not too salty or bland Lobster & Crab Burger - this is the reason, I'm giving 5 stars.  Very good burger.  Unlike most crab burgers, this one had little filling such as bread.  It was filled with mostly crab and lobster meat.  The sauce that comes on the side was a tangy tarted based sauce.    I will try again when I can afford another $30 lunch.",

Paul the bartender was knowledgable, funny, and basically everything you would expect and want. As I frequently do I asked if he had a signature martini - he made me a martini with cucumber and gin that was refreshing and exactly what I was looking for. I believe our servers name was Peter - he's from Greece, maybe that helps - I would HIGHLY recommend him. We started with the calamari which was delicious and the tuna appetizer as well ... For my meal I had the scallops and my date had the aged sirloin - both were cooked perfectly. The ambiance at this Capital grille far surpasses others in my opinion. The hostess at the door was polite and sweet and efficient.  My date had a bit (understatement) too much to drink and the manager John handled the situation with class, patience and complete understanding. Unfortunately I am just in town for the week - otherwise I would frequent this location based on the staff alone. A job seriously well done.",

    "text": "Ooh La La, Capital Grille is the most Ritzy and detail oriented restaurant in Charlotte, to help you understand what I mean allow me to tell a little story:  It was my Girlfriend's Birthday and I wanted to make a good impression on her, so I decided to take her to Capital grille in Uptown Charlotte.  I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.  Then came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.  Capital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out.",

I really love having this for lunch (and since I work uptown, I often do).  It's very fresh, the tomatoes are always very tasty, and the dressing is amazing!  Oh, the price isn't too bad either ($9).  As for their dinner menu, I love the au gratin potatoes and strawberry cheesecake!  The service is wonderful and the bartenders are generou (I've actually had to ask them to lighten up in the alchol in my mojitos a time or two).  Now, for the bad.  I recently tried the grilled chicken caesar salad and don't think I ever will again.  The lettuce was wilted, the dressing was very strong (hello anchovies) and the chicken wasn't fully cooked.  Hopefully the chef was having an off-day because an experience like this at Capital Grille isn't typical.    Overall, this is a great restaurant.  Perfect for a first date or anniversary.  Very cozy atmosphere and a great staff.",

    "text": "I went there this past Saturday night in a party of seven that included two kids (12 and 14). I did not know that they had valet parking as that would have been very useful on a busy uptown Saturday night. Anyway, seating was very prompt as we had a reservation.  I was dressed up quite nicely but most of my party were casually dressed and no one felt uncomfortable. They do have a dress code but I understand that they are lenient.  The service was just so impeccable! Prompt but not intrusive, attentive, courteous, friendly but not overly so, just top notch.  Sorry I forgot our waitress name but she was very helpful in explaining the dishes so that even the kids could understand. Well the food was just outstanding also. We ordered a lot of appetizers to share and all of them were  delightful.  Special mention; the Pan Fried Calamari with hot peppers ( that sure didn't last long!), the creamy  Mashed  potatoes (the best I've ever had), the Lobster and Crab Cakes and the Lobster Mac'N' Cheese (just divinely delicious!). We also had various vegetable sides but I didn't sample many of those.  For the main courses, all the adults had different steaks on the menu. Mine was the Steak au Poivre with a creamy French sounding sauce. It was beautifully tender at medium rare and spiced just right. Everyone raved about their steaks. The kids had their Chicken tenders (?) which was not on the regular menu but the waitress arranged it. The ambience was classy but not stuffy. We were not loud but pretty chatty and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full. The bill ( which I didn't see fortunately, thanks bro!) must have been quite high but it was well worth it.  Everyone was happy, no complaints of any kind. Would absolutely go again on special occasions.",

    "text": "This is our favorite place to go for a special occasion! Start out with a Pineapple Stoli Doli Martini, 2 of these and you will be feeling right! Then for apps we always get the calamari and shrimp cocktail, you would think shrimp cocktail is played out and boring but they are HUGE shrimp with an awesome spicy cocktail sauce. I always get the crab stuffed lobster and we split sides..I've had all before and love them all. Mashed potatoes, asparagus, creamed spinach, but if you never come here you HAVE to try the lobster mac and cheese. To.Die.For. Then finish off with a desert that I will usually take home and eat some later once my food has digested a little, a huge piece of chocolate cake or my favorite, their rich and delicious cheesecake with berries. It is always a lot of food but we love to splurge on special occasions. Birthdays are fun too because they will have your table decorated in fun confetti and always make you feel special. Fun night out!",

As we approached the spot it was very quiet outside so we weren't sure if this was going to work out, but as soon as we stepped inside the energy hit us. The service was very prompt, friendly, and professional. I ordered the Cajun rubbed Delmonico steak and it was wonderful. Sauteed mushrooms as a side and a 2005 Cakebread Cabernet completed the meal. Since the place was unknown to us the unexpected pleasant surprise of the place added to the overall experience.",

It was an excellent experience from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left. Parking was a breeze, there's an easily accessible parking garage steps away from the restaurant entrance. The host greeted us immediately and our table was ready - with a lovely card wishing us a happy anniversary. The wait staff was attentive, the food was fantastic and they treated us to a small dessert. I'm not much of a cheesecake person, but I am so glad I didn't pass it up. We will be returning for future special occasions.",

The fish starts at $45 for less than 8 oz. The steaks are not worth the money. Keep on looking for a place where you are happy to spend your money and happy with every serving of food. I heard complaints about the mashed potatoes, The Potatoes au gratin are excellent and the bread is great! The beer comes in a very small glass. One of our friends sent back a mixed drink because of cheap liquor.   A $51 steak is agreeable if it melts in your mouth and has outstanding flavor. This was only OK. The basted meat was sub-standard.  We spent over $610 with the tip, and 50% was a waste.",

I like the parmesan  vinaigrette and the Cesar dressing best.   Mashed potatoes- Amazing! The best I've had in Charlotte!!!! I will be back for these time and time again!  Asparagus with lemon- perfectly cooked and tender. Really great flavors. If you like asparagus these are wonderful!   Friends dishes:  French Fries- I didn't care for them, but my friend really enjoyed them.   Tuna & rice- Really fabulous dish! My friend said it's by far one of the best in Charlotte.  Lobster - She said it was rubbery, and she wouldn't get it again.   Sword Fish - Excellent! My friend loved it!! She said it was the best.  Filet mignon- my friend said it was perfect and really good",

We usually get the same meal every year. Our steaks came out and both of them were waaay overcooked. We let our server know and he sent them back, the manager came over, got us out fresh side dishes so they'd be hot with our meal. Our new steaks came and THEY WERE OVERCOOKED TOO! We let them know and they insisted the steaks were cooked to order. They were not. Neither of us finished them. We were so disappointed and are considering changing our yearly anniversary dinner to elsewhere. It wasn't worth the $350 we spent. :(",

We had a wonderful meal, aged NY strip Au Poivre for me and seared citrus glazed salmon for my wife. My steak was just a couple minutes past a perfect medium rare for my taste, but was still great. My wife's salmon was melt in your mouth good. The shareable sides, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus were wonderful and generous portions.   The service was impeccable, especially our server, Shawn. It was an anniversary celebration, which I mentioned when I made the reservation. Our table was decorated with heart-shaped confetti and a happy anniversary card. Several other members of the staff also paused to offer best wishes. We mentioned to Shawn that we were headed to a concert and he even offered to hold our leftovers in their cooler so we didn't have to go back to our hotel.   Bottom line, yes you will spend a few dollars here, but you won't leave disappointed or hungry. I'll definitely be back.",

Our server was meticulous and funny. Two glasses of bubbly were immediately brought out as a further gift to our night.  Our meals were excellent. In fact all the tastes (they also brought out some bacon wrapped scallops and other small treats) were fabulous. The wine was excellent and there is an extensive list.

Ordered the stoli doli. Pineapple infused vodka. I thought It was weak. Not just on alcohol but pineapple taste too. I've had this drink before at other places and it tasted better.  Salad was no problem.   Steak...we all paid for an upgrade to our steak.  I asked for medium to medium well. I received almost well and it was kind of dry. My friend wanted that and hers was cooked less so we switched. We made Jessica aware. She asked me if I wanted another one but it will be awhile. I knew they would be closing soon so I declined. As I got closer to the bone the steak was more rare. I stopped eating it. I showed Jessica and my bf took it to eat it. She said nothing about my complaint. My bf did get a nice dessert plate for his birthday. Overall it was an ok experience. Not sure if I will return.",

I seriously think they bake them as orders are received bc it was like a warm , fresh , chocolate party in my mouth .   Now, why not 5stars ? Shockingly if it wasn't for the grand finale of the dessert, I think I would've given 3 stars . I was very disappointed with our steaks, one bone in NY STRIP, the other Bone in Ribeye , I requested medium and It came out medium well , had a hard time cutting it, not as tender as I would have liked and I wanted to ask for steak sauce .  Maybe the boneless Rib eye would've been better? Where was the fat ... we all know a good Ribeye will have some fat on it , that's the flavor . Oh well , the appetizer and dessert alone will bring me back.",

The restaurant has a  very comfortable atmosphere  and the service was excellent . I would rate a 5 but I couldn't because of some inconsistancies  which I will explain below.   The bread basket had delicious  assorted breads such as cracker bread ,onion  bread ,  pumpernickel etc.  served with butter.  The bread display and bread was wonderful to look and to eat .    We ordered  from the special menu for restaurant week. Many of us had the wedge salad with a blue cheese dressing smoked bacon and tomatoes.  Many  of the salads were loaded with tomatoes and blue cheese dressing and the smoked bacon  but some of the salads hardly had any plated tomatoes or smoked bacon .  It would have been nice to have consistency  with all the salads.   Some of us ordered the New England clam chowder which   was delicious.    Most of us also  ordered some kind of steak . The filet minion was tender plated  on a naked plate.  In my opinion there should have been some greens to dress it up a bit.  The  kona rubbed  18 oz  steak was very good . The porcini  rubbed  sliced filet was  was excellent and plated with a delicious  sauce  with tomatoes. One dining mate ordered his filet well-done but it came back with a pink center so he had to return it and wait another 10 minutes while another well-done filet was prepared for him . The staff apologized  and gave him a free glass of wine while he waited.    I ordered the salmon which  I thought was a bit dry and could have had more sauce on  the plate. It was served over  a bed of crunchy green beans almost raw,  which I thought.   The family style sides that came to the table were mashed potatoes, almost a puree but  very delicious . Also  sauteed  green beans  mixed in  with a  very few sauteed tomatoes  and onions were  very good and more tender than my plain green beans plated  with my salmon.   Dessert was excellent : creme Brule and a  rich flourless chocolate cake.  Those who ordered  the creme Brule  said it was wonderful.  All in all this was a wonderful dinner,  prices were moderate for restaurant week otherwise  regular menu a bit pricey , food came to the table hot and  service was excellent. A great wine list. We all would return again.",

    "text": "Consistently Great! I can always count on Capital Grille to provide me with a wow experience whether it's for my birthday (fresh flowers on the table and personalized dessert) or a work celebration (complimentary appetizers and bottle of champagne) the service and dining experience are always exceptional. Most recently I tried the double cut lamb chops and omg they were so so good-well seasoned and prepped perfectly to my preferred temp. My all time favs and must have are the brussel sprouts, truffle fries and bone in-filet if they have it get it (it's like a ribeye/ filet hybrid, filet mignon's tenderness with more flavor)! And of course the desserts, it would be to hard to pick a favorite between the flourless chocolate cake and the cheesecake brulee style both are magical and memorable. Can't wait for another reason to go back.",

As soon as we were seated, our waiter brought us a flute of champagne and our table was decorated with some confetti for the birthday.  If you're a wine drinker, they have an extensive wine list. You can search by a variety of things via their iPad or request a sommelier. I didn't order a cocktail but they had some on there that looked quite tasty.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque. If you're there when they have it, get it. My boyfriend ordered the crock of French onion soup. It's big enough for two people.  As for the steak, I don't think you can go wrong with anything. Their NY bone in strip with Gorgonzola was cooked to perfection.  Make sure to save room for dessert. We sampled the cheesecake and espresso chocolate cake. Both fabulous! If you don't like the taste of espresso, avoid this cake as the flavor is strong.  I highly recommend coming here for a date night or celebratory dinner.",

Angel was our waitress and she was wonderful.  It was the best steak I have ever had in my life. Their was a balsamic glaze on the steak and  I also had the scallops. I will be dreaming about that steak until I get back there.  We also had the cheesecake which had a burnt sugar topping on it like Creme brulee.  This place was expensive and not somewhere I could afford to go often. If you have a special occasion or want the best steak you will ever have, I suggest you give it a try.",

Long before my hubby and I moved to Charlotte, I came to Charlotte a few times on business trips and each of those business trips included a night out at The Capital Grille.  The quality and consistency of the steaks are what keep me coming back. The service is always fantastic and if you happen to mention before hand that you're celebrating an occasion, the staff provides little extras, like decorating your table with confetti, to help you celebrate.  Besides the filet, a few of my favorites are Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers, Creamed Corn with Smoked Bacon,  and Sam's Mashed Potatoes. And I think the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake is a perfect way to end a perfect meal.",

My most recent visit to the Capital Grille was because of a special occasion and by letting the restaurant know ahead of time, the staff went above and beyond what I expected. The attention to detail and the attention of Rebecca our waitress was amazing and made our evening special.  When it comes to the food, our appetizers were perfect and nice portioned sizes. My wife had the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass with Citrus and Pea Tendrils and it met her exacting standards. I had the Dry Aged Sirloin with Au Gratin Potatoes and both were cooked perfectly and the flavors impeccable. One thing to remember for some Yelpers out there is that the menu is a la carte so take that into consideration.  I would definitely recommend the Capital Grille for special occasions or just having a nice dining experience for groups or couples, you may want to leave the kids at home however.",

While enjoying our cocktails, we decided to check out the bar menu. Richard was our server, and he was very attentive & made a few recommendations, one being the smoked salmon. We were sold. He set up a nice dinner display, even though you are sitting at the bar, you get napkin, plate, etc set -up. Our appetizer was delivered and was delicious. The dish comes with smoked salmon, cream cheese, onions, capers, and crostini. It was delicious! I look forward to my next visit, and appreciate that Capital Grille continues to stay True to serving the customer with great food & service!",

    "text": "Sundays in uptown Charlotte during non-football season are just slightly more lively than a ghost town. As such, most of the better restaurants are closed, which is not exactly the most auspicious start to an evening out (in this particular case, Alton Brown's \"Eat Your Science\" tour stop at the Blumenthal). We settled on Capital Grille after finding our first few choices were not open, as I figured that they wouldn't be very busy and the meal should be pretty good.  Well, I was half right. They weren't very busy.  The specials tonight were a South African lobster tail ($45) and a bone-in filet mignon ($64). We ordered one of each, plus a mozzarella and tomato salad and a cup of lobster bisque for appetizers and sides of their lobster mac and cheese and asparagus. Also ordered a pineapple-infused vodka martini for the lady and a bottle of the La Giaretta ripasso-style valpolicella (a decent value at $55).  The martini was decent, the wine was very good. Then the food started arriving. The tomatoes in the mozzarella salad tasted like nothing, certainly not like the vine-ripened tomatoes described on the menu. A little sprinkle of salt, and they tasted like...well, salt. The fresh mozzarella was rubbery and crumbling, which is a time/temperature control issue. The lobster bisque was very tasty, but marred by at least two pieces of shell, one of which I felt in my throat when I swallowed it.  Main courses weren't an improvement. The lobster tail was okay, but nothing like the delicate flavor of cold water lobster. To their credit, the lobster was cooked properly, but definitely not worthy of the price tag. The filet...wow, what a disappointment. Ordered medium rare, and part of the steak WAS medium rare, but not most of it. The steak was fairly charred, and the first couple of centimeters on the side away from the bone were very well done. The next part was a beautiful medium-rare, which became progressively more rare as the meat approached the bone. I like rare beef so this wasn't a huge issue for me other than the fact that it wasn't how it was ordered. The bigger issue was the lack of flavor. \"Brushed with steak butter\" was how the dish was described, but there wasn't even a hint of butter flavor. The price of a filet is due to its incredible texture but the cut isn't the most flavorful, which is why filets are usually paired with a sauce. This steak really needed something more.  Sides: The lobster mac was very good, but a pretty meager portion for its $18 price tag. The asparagus ($11) was overcooked to the point that it was mushy. Because we were short on time due to our event at the Blumenthal, this was the only item I sent back. The replacement sent out by the kitchen was much better.  Once our waiter was told (he never inquired) that the meal was part of a birthday celebration (mine), he picked up our dessert menus and brought out a complimentary creme brulee along with two glasses of champagne. I'll admit, the creme brulee was as good as I've had in quite a while (excluding those made by yours truly). Excellent crust with the custard underneath still cool and creamy...no sweet scrambled eggs like seems to be the norm at John Dressler's restaurants.  The service was okay. Our waiter's wine presentation was a little off, and he managed to spill a bit while pouring. The worst part was his incredible overuse of the word \"perfect\" at every table interaction, especially when so much of the meal was anything but.  The name may be Capital Grille, but my experience was decidedly lowercase. Two stars for an incredibly forgettable yet pricey dining experience. I debated giving a single star, but I'll reserve that for my review of Alton Brown's performance.",

It was not busy when we asked for our car and it easily took 15-20 minutes.  overall a nice Thanksgiving afternoon.",

Strong style references to austere, stoic, masculine, upscale country club, with low lighting and dark cherry wood grain walls. A unique vintage luxury.

A feeling of power and fulfillment in the company of friends that makes you wish you could as for and select an appropriate cigar, sit back and watch the other patrons and listen to your friends.",

    "text": "Yes, it's technically a national chain restaurant, owned by the likes of the same folks who do Longhorn and its ilk.  But when you're on corporate account and/or just need to impress your lunch or dinner companions, it is very hard to go wrong here both in the wine and food departments.  And the jacketed dinner service?  Well, I always feel extremely well taken care of here.    Aside from one of the best looking bars in all of uptown, the space is amazing, with a partially open kitchen with adjacent wine room and plenty of dark wood and rich, dense carpet.  It very much has that \"country club\" look and feel to it.    That ambiance easily carries over to the menu, which is small but that just belies how big the typical portions are.  The same should be said for the calorie count of most offerings.  Friends, leave the diet at the door and prepare to splurge, it's just about impossible not to.  From the decadent lobster bisque soup to the crunchy, earthy goodness of truffled french fries, you simply can't stay within a reasonable calorie count for a proper meal here.  So just forget it, and enjoy.  Standouts for me include the calamari, served with peppers which are not too hot but add a perfect tang to the rich savoriness of the batter than surrounds the actual rings and other bits of delicious seafood.  This could be a meal unto itself, yet it's just their most popular starter.    Steaks do reign on the entree menu, and I recommend going with the options which include the large chunks of fresh crab meat on top.  Why not take good to great?  But I am currently obsessing over the seared tuna with tri-dipping sauces and gingered rice.  Maybe it's the wasabi oil alone, with the palette cleansing bite that comes with every taste?  Whatever it is, I call it insane and it's a struggle not to order it again and again.  But you mustn't stop there, as dessert is just as over the top as everything else in the meal.  Mile-high cheesecake, a decadent chocolate layer cake, creme burulee, and more seasonal offerings.  One is typically plenty to share, or try a few and let the staff box it up for take-home enjoyment afterward.  The staff really cater to your special birthday and anniversary events, so long as you let them know ahead of time, so do share that at the time of reservation.  During late summer, they also have a wine event called The Generous Pour.  It's a fantastic deal that I highly recommend- wine all night long for a very reasonable beverage surcharge.    So, chain or not, this place is great for putting on the swag and showing your guests or yourself a fancy meal out.  Something of a Charlotte staple now, these guys are setting a standard.",

    "text": "I'll be honest- we only ate here because we were given a $100 gift card. This made a ridiculously expensive restaurant cost about as much as it would cost us on an average night out. We skipped drinks and dessert (we were really too full of other stuff anyway!) and our bill still came to $114 before tip. I was surprised that the dress code was so casual for such a nice place; my husband and I dressed up (hey, it's not every day that we eat so fancy!) but we saw folks there in shorts and flip flops, too.  We started with the delicious bread, and calamari. The calamari was spicy, and it would have been better with some sort of dipping sauce, but I guess that isn't classy enough for the Capital Grille! I just squeezed lemon juice all over my plate and it was delicious.  I ordered the citrus-glazed salmon for my entree, with a spinach salad and warm bacon dressing on the side. The salmon was a very generous portion that was very well done. I'm very picky when it comes to salmon and I found this to be fresh and delicious. The salmon also came resting on a generous bed of asparagus, onions, etc. which was an unexpected surprise as we'd been told that all sides were a la carte. I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge. But the salad itself was delicious- more of a dinner portion than a side, actually.  My husband ordered the steak and lobster. At $49 it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, yet is was a LOT smaller than my salmon (which was $33). He was disappointed at the size for that price, actually. But it still managed to be large enough that he couldn't finish it, with the bread and calamari he'd already eaten. The steak and lobster were both delicious, though.  The service was impeccable. Our server, Denise, was friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend the Capital Grille for anyone looking for a nice steak or seafood dinner.",

Service is spot on, and the food prepared perfectly.    Scott was our waiter and he is outstanding.  Great sense of humor, all the while very knowledgable of the menu.    My friends and I came to Charlotte to celebrate our friend's 50th birthday.  We started our evening at a lovely table outside with cocktails.  The pineapple infused martini is heavenly.  The Arnold Palmer cocktail was nice, but I probably will not chose that cocktail on my next visit.  The birthday girl had a tasty Bohemian.     The three of us shared a mouth watering ribeye and a side order of lobster macaroni.  I hear this particular side dish is very popular.  We each had a chopped salad.  The salad was a mixture of amazing flavor, but portion of salad a bit large.  None of us finished our salads.  We polished off our pleasant dining experience with a glass of cognac.  Heavenly!  Then our waiter Scott surprised the table with a delicious cheesecake and a slice of chocolate heaven on a dessert plate!  Scott was great and our celebration was perfect for our friend.    The road noise was a bit bothersome, but Charlotte is a happening city and I would dine outside again in a skinny minute.",

I went with the Scallops and Mushroom Risotto and my friend had the Chilean Sea Bass. The Scallops were really good - and with five on the plate it was the perfect size entree. Some of the best scallops I have ever had.  The Sea Bass was interesting, as it was served in a beef based mushroom consumme broth.That was a little different and would have been better in a bed of something else (like the risotto or maybe some spinach).

    "text": "I've been dying to come here to get my steak on, but the menu prices are downright daunting! This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.  The Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.  Our server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise.   For the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.  The Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night!   The missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.  For dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent.   The Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.",

I have dined at another Capital Grill location in Texas previously and was very pleased with that experience so this past weekend my husband and I were attending a marriage retreat seminar and our \"project\" was to plan a romantic date night. I chose Capital Grill in hopes of a wonderful romantic dinner together. The atmosphere is nice, but it was very loud, not sure if this is typical as the was the first time we dined there. The service was excellent but the food was mediocre at best and absolutely not worth the outrageous prices. Our bill was $176.00. We each had a fields green salad (my husbands salad did not even have a salad dressing and we had to wait to get dressing to pour on it) I had the salmon (which was raw and had to be sent back to be cooked more) we had one side, Au gratin potatoes that were not good and we didn't even eat half between us both. My husband had the \"special\" filet mignon that he ordered thinking that because it was the \"special\" it would be better priced. This definitely wasn't the case as it was $64, but I do understand that this was our fault we didn't ask for the price. The problem was, as the steak wasn't bad, it definitely wasn't anywhere close to the best steak he has had and absolutely not worth the price. We tried not to allow this to ruin our night, but, sadly it kind of did. I was so disappointed in the meal, then to see the tab for a meal that was not good was extremely disheartening. I NEVER write bad reviews for anything as I typically take things in stride, but this was a little over-the-top",

After a brief conversation with a foodie friend, I was directed to CG over Ruths Chris for a good steak experience.   Food: 1 Star   For fancy steakhouses, I only have Flemings and Mortons to compare to. I also have the wise words of my father who always told me that only poorly cooked steaks need steak sauce.   I've been to Flemings several times and every time it's always come seasoned perfectly. At Capital Grille in Charlotte, to my surprise and disappointment, I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned, tasteless steak to show for it. I did order some bleu cheese crumbles to go with it but it didn't mix well either. I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit!   But to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal. I am assuming my problem was remote and hopefully only a local problem but it left a bad taste in my mouth for the next time I goto a nice steakhouse.

    "text": "this is one of my favorite places ever to have food and wine. They are an awesome establishment with top-notch service especially from Sherry and Joe and Edith and Order. Everything is great here. Top notch. You're never going to go wrong with their specials any of their steaks which are limited for good reason because each one done to perfection. Were there salmon or seafood. All of their sides are amazing it's hard to choose if you're unsure you can go with the lobster mac and cheese which is so delicious like a desert. I enjoy the opportunity to have a wine locker here as well and they treat all of their guests with white glove service.",

There was no wait & we were greeted with by courteous staff. I have had the privilege of tasting some great food in my lifetime but I usually feel as if I got my money worth. Im sad to say that although the experience was top notch and enjoyable, the limited menu options, the crowded seating space, the astronomical price gouging and taste needs improvement. I can say that I've tried this place but unfortunately I don't think I would return , strictly for the PRICE! ",

So we finally got a chance on an invite with another couple during Queens feast this weekend. I was nearly totally disappointed with the food that we were served.   The steaks \"the 5 of us that had steak at our table agreed on this\" were a mere \"OK\" as far as quality and taste. There wasn't any flavor other than just meat flavor on the filets that my wife, sister, daughter, and myself got. They were cooked to the correct temperature we asked for so that was good. The 5th person got the aged NY strip with bone in steak. I was able to try it and agreed with him it was lacking flavor also. The appearance of the food was nice but nothing we had lived up to the fame I've been presented with over the years.   I gave 3 stars based on the food vs service. Food was nothing to desire again. Service was great, Brandon was our server. He was on point with presenting the menu, drinks, clean up, etc.",

This place is phenomenal. The food was excellent and I now totally understand the pricing of this place. Luckily for me I made reservations unbeknownst to me that it was restaurant week. So we got a three course meal for a low price. I would absolutely pay the regular price since this place is well worth it. From the beginning of my reservation the staff was ready and on hand to help me execute the day. I was planning a surprise dinner for my Honey and from the cupcakes, to the roses as well as the confetti scatter, everything was how I asked them to present the evening(except they didn't sing). The food was seasoned all the way through...and the drinks were super strong. We also had complimentary champagne. I will definitely go back since the 13 year wait was worth it. I don't know how long this place has been in existence but whatever the price I'll gladly pay!!! Oh and I couldn't give it Five Stars since I didn't check out the bathroom(pet peeve) but I'm pretty sure next visit it'll be updated!!",

We arrived at a table decorated with little pink hearts and a happy anniversary card with a hand written note! Joe S. was our waiter and his service was delightful! He wished us a happy anniversary and brought two glasses of complimentary champagne. We also ordered a bottle that he served us.  For our appetizer we had the calamari. Amazing and full of flavor! I got the swordfish with crab on top and it was perfectly soft and delicious. My boyfriend for the filet mignon with onion and mushrooms and it was a perfect texture and taste! We also shared a half order of the soy glazed Brussels which were savory and heavenly! The soy flavor was strong, while not being too salty.  We also got an adorable complimentary dessert! Everything from beginning to end of this experience was great and we are excited to come back again! Thank you!",

Of course Capital Grille never disappoints!  Perfect location in Uptown with a parking garage 1 block away. The Staff here are always courteous and attentive. I don't mind the prices as long as the food is top-notch and we have great service. We chose to dive right in with entres and 2 sides. My friend chose the 22oz Bone-In Ribeye and I chose the Chef's Selection Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with 15-year Aged Balsamic. Wow!  Both steaks were seasoned well and flavorful!  I must say I was the hands down \"Winner Winner Steak Dinner\" with the Chef's Selection Ribeye!!  This preparation with the Porcini rub and the Balsamic is out of this world and I am glad I went for it!! Oh did I mention the sides, we chose 2 sides to share: the Lobster Mac n Cheese and the Au Gratin Potatoes!  Both are excellent sides but the Lobster mac n Cheese was exceptional tonight with the right balance of cheeses and cream.  I usually don't do doggie bags here but we both wanted the full experience and we decided to stop the feast at bag it for tomorrow and go for desserts!  So for dessert I had the Warm Double Chocolate cake with Port Wine infused Cherries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream sand my friend chose the Capital Grille Cheesecake Brulee Style with berries.  Both were just down right sinfully great!!  We were both completely satisfied from our culinary escapade and couldn't stop talking about the great food here!  The Capital Grille  earned the 5 Stars  Tonight easily!! Thanks!  I'll be back!",

    "text": "I have a confession to make. I really like a nice cut of red meat.  I like it medium rare and I like it to melt in my mouth. I know The Capital Grille is a chain but it never disappoints. Sometimes I pop in just for their signature stoli doli drink and calamari.  But sometimes I go all out and have the full meal.  This time I went during Charlotte Restaurant week and ordered from the special menu.  We skipped the calamari this time because we knew how much food was about to arrive at our table. We also took part in their \"generous pour\" offer.  It was 3 courses of 3 samples of wine. Approximately a 3 oz pour each so it really is a great deal if you want to try out something new.   So for my appetizer I decided to try out the clam chowder. I usually opt for the salad but I saw such good reviews bragging on the clam chowder I had to try it out for myself. It wasn't the best clam chowder I've ever had but it was quite good. Had lots of clams in it!  I continued my meal with my love affair with medium rare filet. It was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. It came with whipped mashed potatoes and green beans . The beans were a little too al dente for me. Actually, they tasted like they weren't even cooked.  And finally, we finished up with both the flourless chocolate cake and he creme brulee. Skip the cake and get the brulee!  It's a fancier restaurant uptown. We went right before a concert at Spectrum. Be sure to make a reservation. There was actually a wedding proposal there that night.  If you don't want to spend the cash on their expensive month, check them out during restaurant week!",

The sides are definitely for two so if you're not a big eater I'd def split the sides with your date. The prices can be a little pricey but it's worth every penny spent.

The strip came out a bit over cooked and when I mentioned it to our server he insisted the kitchen make me another. The service is superb and they constantly want to make sure you are happy and the food it exceeding expectations. On the surprising side my favorite dish to date was actually their burger made with Pat Lafreida's blend of short rib and brisket with caramelized onions...just drooled a little typing that.",

A friend in our group was pretty drunk when we got there, but the server was so patient and even laughed at his antics ( not that he was terrible, but a bit loud and constantly making lame jokes). I don't think there was anything anyone got that they didn't love. I had oysters on a half shell and a cup of clam chowder soup. Both were delicious. My husband had a steak which he devoured, plus we ordered 3 bottles of wine. Yikes! Definitely a big bill, but it was our friend's birthday so we had splurged a little. Will go here again for sure. Maybe we will try to not drink so much wine though next time. (it cost almost double compared to what you would pay at total wine or grocery store).",

Cap Grill will not knock your socks off with innovative food or design but you should know that before going in.   I've had excellent service, weather in the bar or the dining room, by myself or with a group a friends. Personally, I prefer the bar, I'm a casual diner and get unduly nervous anywhere I must speak in hushed tones and remember which fork to use.   The food is precisely cooked and well presented. I enjoy starting with the calamari. It's mixed with fried peppers, so you might be getting squid or hot pepper; unless you're careful it's a surprise. The aioli is a must.   This is the place for a steak (medium rare). And also the home of one of the best burgers (med rare) in town.   Dessert is great - I usually opt for the flourless torte but honestly every thing I've tried has been excellent.",

Met our two daughters Friday after Thanksgiving for a lovely dinner.  10 oz filet was cooked to perfection with crab meat of equal flavor and ample quantity. My favorite side is the creamed spinach but the lobster mac and cheese is also amazing and loaded with lobster. My daughter had the crab lobster cake appetizer as a meal. Two four ounce cakes so generous she took one home. The tomato and mozzarella salad was fresh, tasty and had high quality balsamic to add to the flavor.  The wine list was expansive and high tech! Our server Amber was by far the highlight of the night. So professional, helpful, available, and yet not intrusive. We stayed several hours yet never felt rushed! We had more left overs than the Thanksgiving dinner and you can already guess what leftovers were eaten first! Great experience in every way!",

In addition to this they give you a plate full of freshly made potato chips that are delicious. Between both of these it made for a perfect happy hour along with their awesome rum selection.

We arrived early so decided to have a drink at the bar, but that turned into 2 drinks and ouch our tab was expensive! I wish we had been running late instead!  We were seated right on time for our reservation - this is very important to me - I hate when restaurants make you wait more than 10-15 minutes to be seated.  Our waiter greeted us promptly, explained the Restaurant Week menu and showed us the regular menu and the wine list. We both wanted to try the RW menu - I had the filet and my husband had the bone in Kona crusted sirloin. We also had salads and sides for the table. Dessert was creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake (both = yummm).   The food came out quickly (maybe too fast?) and our waiter checked on us just the right amount. The food was very good. Not quite up to my favorite steak restaurant (Del Frisco's) in terms of quality of food or atmosphere. But the service was excellent. It just feels outdated in there and the steak wasn't that melt-in-your-mouth quality that I want from a high-end steak house.  I am glad I tried The Capital Grille and I would go back - but it probably wouldn't be my first choice for an exquisite steak in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Disappointing ... I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).  When we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware.   It took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish.   The main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - sauteed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,  Our drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.",

The food was very good. Then menu is decently large with several options that sounded great. I ordered the scallops and was very happy with my choice.  The service was not bad but also not out of this world great. Maybe it was an off night for our server, who seemed like a seasoned professional when we first sat down, I don't know. We asked for limes with our sparkling water that never were served, asked for butter that had to be requested again, and a salad came out incorrect. Everything was taken care of once we mentioned it, I just feel like at a place as luxurious as this you should not have to say so many reminders to service. But with all that said the service was good and this experience would not keep me from dining here again.",

    "text": "I have come here many times over the years... Mostly for working lunches.  Today, I decided to come with a coworker and NOT work during lunch.  We were greeted immediately, and seated shortly thereafter.  Once at our table, we were promptly served water and handed menus... and then we waited... and waited... and waited... You see, I think the issue was that no one designated a waiter to our table, AND we were tucked away a bit...  Finally, Ryan Rudisuhli saw us and asked if we'd been helped... upon hearing a \"no\" from us, he became instantly apologetic and extremely attentive to the point that we were served complimentary clam chowder before our entree salads and dessert afterwards for our wait.    I must say... the teeny tiny hiccup aside... we were VERY well cared for here.  My salad entree had the seared salmon with mango, avocado, and tomato salsa... my coworker had the caesar with shrimp.  We had a great lunch, everything was so well prepared, and our waiter, Ryan, was an absolute gem!    If you're looking for a good place to treat yourself to a nice lunch uptown OR just need a cool spot for a business meal, the Capital Grille is ALWAYS a good staple in uptown Charlotte!",

But let's be clear the service needs to match the price point.   We had the best experience from start to finish!! The bartender David was absolutely AMAZING! He   Was friendly from start to finish. The Stoli Doli was amazing.  The food.... WHEW!!! The lobster and crab cakes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, bone in Kona NY strip, sea bass, and cheese cake were ALL amazing.  The manager John came over to introduce himself and chat us up about the cheese cake. It's great to know that our sentiments about the cheesecake are shared! The server Mario was friendly, funny, and just the right amount of attentive without being overbearing. I definitely recommend this place for not only the food but the service, ambiance, and overall experience!!",

Everything we ordered was fabulous . Great flavor and I just so happened to come during the summer wine event so I got to try some great wines which Ashley gave great descriptions of !

Upon arriving there was someone standing outside the door to greet us and hold the door for us. Even though it was quite chilly out, he still had a warm smile. We were shown to our table immediately upon entering which was a cozy half moon shaped booth. The waitstaff was excellent which I look forward to with each visit.   For appetizer, we ordered the lobster and crab cake. It was served with a cold corn salad which was really tasty. We planned on sharing them, but soon realized that we needed to order ourselves another round. I ordered she crab soup and my husband ordered the new york strip. We were too stuffed to have a dessert on this visit, but next time for sure.",

My experience at this establishment was wonderful from start to finish. The ambiance and service were all excellent! Sunday, I came for a group outing which started at 6 PM, I choose to have a drink at the bar beforehand. As always, I'm a big fan of ANY establishment with purse hooks under the bar--these details matter, friends! The wine selection is great, I ordered a glass of the UpperCut, Napa, Merlot, 2013. Shockingly smooth and rich!  Now let's talk about the food! My friends and I had the pleasure of dining inside the private \"Exchange Room\" which sits outside of the restaurant. This room is perfect for special events and gatherings, the setup is beautiful.  Our group enjoyed a lovely four-course dinner with shared apps, sides, and desserts from the Sunday Butcher & Baker Menu. Here's a list of everything we enjoyed:   (Shared Apps) Calamari Crabcakes Procuttio Wrapped Mozorella  Chef's Seasonal Salad - Bibb lettuce, mixed baby greens, radishes, baby carrots, heirloom tomatoes with parmesan vinaigrette. The parmesan vinaigrette is DELISH  The Butcher's Choice (we got to select one) I ordered The 16 oz  Capital Grille Prime Rib Medium well - This item was served with roasted bone marrow. Possibly the BEST Prime Rib i've ever had!   Double Cut Cheshire Pork Chop-Slow roasted with honey and whole grain mustard glaze topped with crispy onions.  Salmon Wellington en Croute-Roasted wild mushrooms, sauteed spinach, and horseradish creme fraiche.  (Share Sides) Sam's Mashed Potatoes Lobster Mac & Cheese (LOVED, Cheesy goodness) Soy Glazed Brussels Sprouts with Bacon (LOVED)  (Shared Desserts) Warm Apple Crostata w cinnamon streusel and housemade vanilla ice cream Cheesecake, Chocolate Cake, and Creme Brulee  All of the food was delicious with no flavor overpowering. I look forward to dining at The Capital Grille again very soon. There are lots of specials during the week. Thank you Capital Grille for a wonderful experience.",

Our a Server , Sherry Webb, was most informative, helpful, polite, sweet and friendly.  The food was perfectly made. Our calamari was lightly breaded with a kick of peppers. There were some hot peppers that will wake your palette. The salad was tossed in the perfect amount of dressing.  The clam chowder was creamy with some small diced potatoes, the cup was the perfect amount. Our steak and salmon was perfectly cooked. The mashed potatoes were amazing, one of the best I ever had. The green beans were ok, not our favorite.   Our desserts close our night with a highlight. My husband and I were so impressed with our server.   We will definitely be back.",

I'm kicking myself because I can't recall the name of our server and he was a straight-up ninja!  I don't know how he did it, but he refilled our glasses before we even noticed we were low.  (If management reads these reviews - we were a private party of about 35 on June 15th.) One person at our table kept receiving water refills from someone else that didn't know she actually had Sprite, but our water replaced the error each time before she took a sip.  He brought out the club soda and napkins for another member of our party when some food made it's way onto her shirt.  He was AMAZING.  Then...there's the food.  Oh man.  Seriously.  What didn't I love?  The Capital Grille can even make brussels sprouts amazing, kudos to them!  The grilled asparagus and roasted wild mushrooms were divine too.  Did I mention the insanely gigantic Grand Plateau?  It had crab, lobster, shrimp, and oysters.  My steak was done to perfection and was so big there was no way I could finish it.  And don't forget about the desserts.  I loved them all - the classic creme brulee, the flourless chocolate cake, and the cheesecake.  Get it all!  I can't wait to return to The Capital Grille and just writing about it is making me hungry for it!",

I only had a selection of small plates and a drink, but what I had was spectacular and our server was amazing.

If this was my first time getting here for dinner. My wife took me out for my birthday and wow what a treat!  The raisin bread and onion bread are a must! The butter had a firm cheese-like consistency and was extremely flavorful. For drinks, my wife had reisling and I had two cocktails. My first was the \"In Fashion\" and this was by far the STRONGEST cocktail I've ever had in my life. It had the perfect blend of bourbon and bitters that just made me want to smoke a cigar. My second drink was the grapefruit Fire and Ice which had two different tequilas and was infused with Fresno peppers. Spicy but delicious!  I had the lamb chops and they were delicious. I got them well done and very few restaurants know how to do this without burning them. Lamb chops are the only things I have to eat well done. He came with a cherry reduction sauce however so it was very good and wasn't necessary. The lamb chops were seasoned to perfection. My wife and I shared the potatoes augratin and the sauteed mushrooms. These were some of the best mushrooms I've ever had. So I've only been here for lunch I can't wait to come back for dinner. Everything was amazing!",

Typically when I do that at restaurants, they never read the special instructions. Especially when it comes to seating. When we arrived the restaurant was really nice and clean and we were seated almost immediately.  The menu was very easy to understand and we really enjoyed having a lot of options. We ordered the crab and lobster cake appetizer and it was delicious. So delicious my husband did not want to share, but I made him. Ha! There were two crab and lobster cakes along with chilled corn.   I ordered a glass of Riesling which was delicious. It was semi sweet and I loved it! For dinner, I ordered the bone-in New York strip with Gorgonzola on top. It was absolutely amazing. We also ordered the mushroom as a side and the potatoes au gratin. Both were equally amazing.  The manager came over towards the end and address me by name and asked if I enjoyed everything. I really appreciate it that! It was very personable.  After dinner, they bought us two small desserts. The creme brulee cheesecake was amazing.   The restaurant was pretty pricey but it was worth every dime.",

    "text": "First time at a capital grille, overall great experience. For a high end restaurant, it's about what I thought it would be in terms of food and service. Had a reservation and was seated promptly. I want to say we got very lucky and had an amazing server (Mithoon) who knew the menu perfectly, had a great sense of humor, and was very personable.   As for the food, table starts with assorted breads and butter, Fiji bottled water and sparkling bottled water. I started with French onion soup. Very good but I was hoping for something different/better, not that it was bad, but honestly average. The Caesar salad I thought was delicious and light, and I enjoyed their style of croutons (not box kind).  For the main course we shared a dry porterhouse, without seasoning, just salt, cooked medium rare. I thought I was excellent and cooked perfectly. If you want to enjoy it, you need some sides. Top recommendation is lobster Mac and cheese, one of the best  I've ever had. Other great sides are the o'graten potatoes and mash potatoes, I prefer the regular mash, so creamy and perfect with the porterhouse. If you like brussel sprouts, I also highly recommend them; it's a soy based sauce and there's nice chunks of bacon in there that are heavenly. The mushrooms were just okay, not a wow like the rest.  For desert, tops is coconut cream pie, and I'm not even a huge coconut fan, but you must try. Double chocolate cake takes second, kind of like an open lava cake, comes out hot, and with the vanilla ice cream you got a hell of a nice desert. Also tried the flourless chocolate cake, it's super rich and in the hard side, not creamy at all but delicious. This is a great gluten free option.   For the wine drinkers, they have a nice cellar, but it's byob and they charge a corking fee, and they bust out the decanter.   Free valet outside the front entrance, otherwise street parking. Clean bathrooms, great staff, I would come here again!",

We were greeted and seated promptly (we did have a reservation). The wait staff was very professional and attentive throughout dinner. We did order from the bar (there was a full bar) however I felt like we needed to order from their drink menu. The wait staff did not seem confident that my boyfriend could get the drink he wanted the way he wanted it.   I ordered the salmon, mushrooms, potatoes au gratin. My boyfriend had the roasted chicken. The food was good overall. The mushrooms could have used a little more seasoning but the potatoes were delicious!   Oh I forgot to mention that the table was decorated nicely with confetti and a card from the restaurant for my birthday. Very nice touch!   I did get a complimentary dessert for my birthday and the waiter even offered to take our pic!   I would go back for sure but special occasions only because it was definitely pricey but it is upscale so that's to be expected!!!",

I walked in by myself, the wife was still parking after waiting 10 minutes out front for a valet attendant. To her disappointment, the valet service is after 6pm, but you do not know that until you walk up to the valet podium to see the sign. I politely waited about 10 minutes for a hostess to seat me & the wife arrived a few minutes later after parking in a garage that didn't feel safe to her. Sherry was our waiter & was very pleasant as well as informative. The food was good but not unusually spectacular & it did arrive in a reasonable time. The bill appeared high for the structured Queens Feast, but we attributed it to the second glass of wine she had. With the lighting so dim & the receipt print faded we paid the bill with the intent of checking it at home. After walking my wife to her car in the shady parking garage near by she drove me to my car parked in the street. Once home we reviewed the receipt  to discover a 3rd $35 Queens Feast was charged in error. I called & was transferred to a manager I assume that apologized & assured me it would be credited. I'm not sure who's error it was, but Sherry now gets tipped on the overcharged bill & walks away with a bonus percentage on an already fair 20% while we are merely given an I'm so sorry... we will gladly return to Del Frisco's & Ruth Chris for our future uptown steakhouse experiences.",

When I received the bill, it was $31.00!!!!!.  When I questioned it, Peter said he would go and rerun the bill for a regular fish burger but then came back and said \"they said the reason is you are paying for an entree\". The waiter Peter did not tell me that I was paying the price for an entree. If I had known, I would have ordered the entire entree and not PAY $31.00 for a &?**! BURGER AND FRIES!!!  UNACCEPTABLE!",

Our wait staff was professional and courteous, but the food was nothing to brag about and hardly worth the $300 tab (no wine or alcohol). There were five in our party and three of our steaks were not done as we asked. Mine was cooked to the right color (pink center) but it was not hot! I mean, this is a steakhouse, you should NEVER have to send your steak back... The grilled asparagus was excellent as were the garlic mashed potatoes. But that is not what you go to a steakhouse for.

I asked for grilled onions with my steak, and received what looked like a dried out, halved onion that had been on the flat top for a few seconds. The spinach was not evenly cooked (some came out looking like spinach salad, and some parts were wilted), and was not flavorful. My husband's scallops were also dry and overcooked. The lobster macaroni was pretty good, but overall, the food was exceedingly sub-par from what I have come to expect from Capital Grille, and what their prices are. It was the kind of meal I would expect from Applebees. Del Frisco's is a much better fine dining experience in Charlotte.",

First the server argued with me when I asked about the Kona Steak and stopped him once he said coffee was in the rub. He said you can't taste it and I said I dislike coffee a lot and I probably would and he wanted to argue about it. Second, the staff came and took our plates and appetizer before we were done with it and we had to get up and track him down to get it back. Third, the side and steak came out about 10 mins apart. Fourth, the medium rare I requested came out blood red and cold it was so rare. Fifth the lobster mac had shell pieces from the lobster that I thought cracked a tooth it hurt so bad. Sixth, the server hands the bill to someone other then myself even though my name was on the reservation. All in all this was a VERY BAD experience at one of my favorite steak houses. Worst part about was I was trying to close a deal with clients and the bad service was the topic of conversation instead of my closing.",

At this point I have waited over an hour and fifteen minutes. It wasn't until I got visibly upset that I was seated. For a place that prides themselves on customer service they should be embarrassed. I can easily spend $100 on a dinner for one at a number of other restaurants down the street. Needless to say, I'll be taking my money elsewhere from now on and never come back.",

Very simple menu - which is good - but the prices are about 20% higher than they really need to be.  I had the dry aged new york strip and it was good, but it wasn't $46 good.  My girlfriend had the 10oz filet but it was dry (prepared medium) which is inexcusable for a place charging this much money.  Au Gratin Potatoes were good and we shared them as a side and the lobster bisque was also good.  I don't think this is a bad place to eat but the one thing I was missing was value.  If you need to impress someone just baed on how much money you can spend go ahead and go here but my meal at Rooster's was much better for less money. Just seems like there are some artificially inflated prices.",

    "text": "I took my family here for Charlotte's Restaurant Week the other night to celebrate my dad's birthday. There were 5 of us. Let me just say, it was incredible. I've done the Restaurant Week thing before on numerous occasions and, it's very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out as quickly as possible. This was absolutely not the case here.  Being that it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu for us to choose from. Unfortunately, there was not a vegetarian option (my fiancee is vegetarian), however the server spoke with the chef and they were able to come up with an incredible vegetarian pasta that she loved. The server was very conscious to avoid any soups that had a meat broth as well. In addition, at no point were any of our water glasses ever empty, every interaction with the server was met with a smile, and what's more important, we never felt rushed. The server found out that it was my dad's birthday, and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert (complementary).   As for the food, I can say that this was without a doubt the best steak I've ever had. The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly! For some perspective, I've eaten at Ruth's Chris, Del Friscos, and several other high-end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high-end country club. Capital Grille blew all of them out of the water.   I truly can't say enough about our experience. My dad said that it was the best birthday he'd had in a very long time, and attributed it to his experience at Capital Grille. If you are looking for a great place to eat, with great service, I can't recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "Ok, I told you all that we were on a celebration romp through Charlotte and it ended at The Capital Grille. The hubs out did himself this time :-)   Let me begin by thanking our server Alissa, who was cordial, attentive, and upbeat the entire night. It was our first time at Capital Grille and I was so impressed with the ambiance of the restuarant. It looked like there were enough \"suits\" in the place to write a check to clear the federal deficit, but I liked that. The decor had an old world feel blended with a wall street vigor. The hostess was gracious and we were seated immediately and noticed the restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night.   Alissa explained the chef features for the night and we agreed to try it. We received complimentary champagne and I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer. It was a good portion and was served with aioli, capers, chopped onions, and crisp pita triangles. I enjoyed it immensely as smoked salmon is one of my favorites. The hubs ordered a salad, and we ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese and truffle fries for our son, the Gabe-meister (I kept theifing the lobster out of the mac-n-cheese it was soooo good) and the truffle fries were amazing, it had this parmasen flavor to it. I do not eat red meat regularly but wanted to try the feature 4 oz filet medallion at medium with a fennel based sauce. The hubs opted for the 12 oz. filet mignon at medium rare with crab (out of the shell) in butter sauce. Needless to say we enjoyed the meal and left completely satisfied and impressed with Capital Grille. The food was great but it was the service that really impressed, two managers came by and wished me a happy birthday and checked on us to see if everything was ok. VERY NICE TOUCH! :-)  For dessert, we brought our favorite cheesecake creme  iced cake from Harris Teeter, and yes the restaurant was fine with it. We shared cake with Alissa and she enjoyed it as well.  All-in-all, the Capital Grille has managed to produce quality, flavourful food and white glove service as a chain restaurant. We're requesting Alissa next time we visit :-)",

The sales rep from a film production supply house smoothly lied and said Channel 70 Productions was his favorite customers (I am a real pain because I demand perfect service and a high level of competence from my vendors) and offered to buy dinner and I accepted since his offer included the Capital Grille. Right away I noticed people actually dressed for dinner. I like that and it gave me a chance to wear the Countess Mara tie my wife had given me the previous week. Yeah, I know it's name dropping, but both my wife and the tie deserve the credit. I'm one of the few men on the planet who enjoys receiving ties as gifts. The tables were too close together for my liking and it was easy to overhear the conversations of others. Perhaps they were just talking loudly.  I ordered the Delmonico with no seasonings. I always order steaks minus seasoning. If a steak needs that kind of help, then the steak isn't much to begin with. The steak was great. One of the best steaks I've had in awhile. Service was movie perfect. If your wallet can stand the heat, dine at the Capital Grille on your next trip to Charlotte.",

Every turn that I needed to take was forbidden by either \"no left turn\" or \"no right turn\" signs.  I had to end up going several blocks out of my way and ultimately doing an illegal turn to get to the restaurant.  Finding parking is sort of difficult, as well.  From what I understand, Valet parking does not start until 6:00pm and I got to the restaurant at about 5:30pm.  I would recommend parking in the garage for the office building next door to the restaurant.  Capital Grille will validate your parking if you park there.  The food is very good, but also fairly expensive.  I had 8 people in my group and our total bill was right at $1,100.00 including tip.  This did include two bottles of mid-priced wine, though.  I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and it was very good.  As far as sides, I would recommend the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese and Au Gratin Potatoes.  We also got the seafood appetizer platter and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The desserts are large and very tasty.",

The Servers introduced themselves, acknowledging you by name.  Everything is explained , care and attention is paid to every detail.  Wine and cocktails were excellent, as well as the appetizers. Soup was out of this world with huge lumps of lobster in it!   Main course was served with care  and inquiries as to if they were exactly as we ordered. Our steaks were cooked exactly as requested and could be cut with your fork.  Outstanding cuts of meat.  The sides were huge and the lobster mac and cheese was outstanding.  Desserts were excellent and again huge portions.   We had so much food that we needed to take a fair amount home.  Which is unusual for us.  The servers took the remaining food, boxed them up in cute boxes, wrote exactly what was in each box and sealed them to prevent  spills.   They were packed into large bags!    The servers in subtle ways, did everything needed before we asked, before we needed it and made it a worry free, no stress dining experience.  Yes we will be back!",

They brought out a bread basket to start, I highly reccomend the bread with the carmelized onions on top. We both ordered the current special of Waygu burger and glass of wine for $25 (we chose the Silver Oak Cab) served with parm. truffle fries. Burger was juicy and very flavorful.. served on a perfectly toasted bun with an overeasy egg and soft butter lettuce. We got a side of their dijion mustard and it was a perfect compliment to the burger. No need for ketchup for the burger or fries for sure. Dessert was a flourless espresso chocolate cake (friend loved it, I dont 'do' coffee) and a 'not-NY style' (as the server put it) cheesecake with a brulee top served with fresh berries. The food and the service made dining here an 'experience'... the price point is on the higher side (IMO!) so if you would normally not spend that for dinner I would definately reccomend for a special occasion... it will be my go-to spot for birthdays for sure!",

Our waitress, Michelle, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu items as well as the wine she was serving us...that's a HUGE plus in my book. We started off by sharing their fried calamari tossed with cherry peppers...fabulous!  We then shared the house chopped salad, which was full of great stuff and tossed in a light vinegarette dressing.  I liked more than my wife did.  For our entree, we shared the delmonico steak, lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach.  We had a problem with the steak because it was way over cooked.  Michelle cheerfully took it back, apologized and brought us a new one along with all new fresh sides.  The steak was just ok and we really should've ordered the porterhouse but the sides were just rediculously good.  She then proceeded to buy us 2 desserts of our choice...carrot cake (special) and chocolate hazelnut cake (on the menu).  The carrot cake was one of the best I've ever had but the chocolate cake just ok. Through each course Michelle brought us more wine tastings and I believe we had 7 overall. It was great night and even though the steak was not a favorite, I would return again and simply pick a different one.",

Our bill was $209 for 4 people...some may think its a little pricey but I think it was well worth it and would certainly do it all over again with no hesitation.

LeeAnn D's review summs up that experience perfectly except she left out the bread basket.  I swear I could have been happy just sitting there eating bread all night, it was such a great selection!  The last time I was here was for restaurant week.  As a thank you for the meal in Dec, the manager gave my friend a $50 gift card for a return visit that had to be used by beginning of Feb, so we decided to eat here again.  Mixed green salad was good, dressing on the side though otherwise it drowns the lettuce.  Porcini rubbed tournedos of beef were excellent, and I actually couldn't finish both.  The mashed potatos were probably the best I have ever had anywhere.  You just knew there was 3 sticks of butter and a ton of heavy cream in there, but they were simply amazing.  The creamed spinach however, tasted like soap, bleh.  Our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny, but the 2nd batch just had a milder soapy flavor.  Still this was not enough to ruin an otherwise perfect meal.  Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn't care for dessert, was a great ending to the meal.  With the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about $43 pre tip.  Tip on the pre discounted amount and we still walked away paying $60 for a meal that could have been A LOT more expensive.  I almost felt like we were stealing since I know how pricey this place can be!",

My girlfriend and I had 9:15 reservations and it took until about 9:30-9:45 to be seated which is understandable and the bar staff was wonderful while we waited. It was all downhill from there. We were both dressed extremely nice even better than some of the older patrons that were there who were wearing polo shirts and tshirts with sports coats.  That did not matter since we were 10 years younger than every other patron.  Our service was terrible which I suspect was due to the fact that we were the youngest people in the restaurant. It took 20-30 min to receive my bud light. I ordered the kona crusted strip medium rare and the only part of the steak that was slightly pink was the part near the bone. My girlfriend ordered the wedge salad with an added chicken breast with a side of au graten potatoes. Her meal was good other than the fact that once she finished 1/4 of her food the wait staff repeatedly asked if we would like a to go box to which I eventually caved and agreed to in order to get out of the dining area. I have been a waiter and bar tender for years to pay my way through law school so I understand when the restaurant is busy. Understanding this I did not feel it was appropriate at the time to complain to the manager. That being said, the service we received was inexcusable. I felt the wait staff was snoody and treated us with minimalistic attention because we were the youngest people in the restaurant. I would advise young couples against a romantic date night here and to try one of the many other options in Charlotte.  It does not matter how long a steak is dry aged when it is cooked to the point of shoe leather. I will never eat at this restaurant again after the disrespect we received on what was supposed to be a romantic and very enjoyable dinner.",

There was quite a bit of lobster in the cakes and they were scrumptious.  We shared a 10 oz Filet  which was plenty for us.  It was cooked to perfection.  We had scalloped potatoes and asparagus which we took home left overs.  They had one of our favorite wines from Chandon Domaine which I have not seen in a resturant before. They brought us out 2 small desserts: one on each end of plate with Happy Anniversary in the middle.  They took our picture with their camera and provided us with the picture.  Our waiter was superb along with the service.  The managers made sure we were happy by checking on us several times.",

We started with the lobster and crab cakes, which were served with a cold corn relish and house-made tarter sauce.  I appreciated the huge hunks of lobster in the cakes.  I had that night's special, which was a bone-in tenderloin.  That was the best steak I've ever eaten.  I paired it with the wine suggested by our waiter and the combo was incredible.  My husband had the porterhouse.  We also tried the lobster mac n cheese.  Amazing!!   I'm already looking forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "Open up your brain tank because I'm about to pour in some high octane premium knowledge--  Have you ever walked out of a restaurant and felt like you didn't get your money's worth??  Have you ever walked out of a restaurant and felt like you wanted refinance your home, open up a restaurant house account, rent a cot in the back room, never ever leave, and never eat anything else again??  That is how I feel every time I exit Capital Grille after a meal.   Is it expensive?? Yes, but you are getting exactly what you pay for.. An exceptional meal and stellar customer service.  Everything about this place just exudes class and a stylish subtle comfort.    The menu is specific and gets right to the point.  There isn't a ton of options because this is what they do and they do it very very well.  First-Steak.  Second-Wine.  Third-Sides.  Fourth-Seafood.  I've had the Kona Bone-in Rib-eye and the Tenderloin with Lobster.  Both are so succulent that I get into a subconscious gladiatorial battle over which one to select.  No matter what you decide to go with, you should always choose the Lobster Mac N Cheese as a side.  WOW!  You are just being foolish if you don't.  Now, I am no wine connoisseur but the wine list is so extensive that it dwarfs the normal menu.  I'm talking about an endless amount of options and trust me when I tell you that your server will know about every single one.  So, just simply talk to him/her and tell them what you like or what suggestions they might have.  I think they have to go through some sort of wine school to become a server there.  They know all.    Now, I need to give this next Yelp nugget its own paragraph.  The truffle fries... Oh lordy Lord.... the truffle fries.  Fries so good that even touching them with ketchup or BBQ would be such a crime that I would \"soup nazi\" the rest of your meal.  \"NO CAP-G FOR YOU! - YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE CAP-G\"  Yeah, bringing it back to Seinfeld for that one.  They are hot, properly seasoned, and perfect just the way they are.  Get classy on those fries and use the fry tongs that they give you.  Don't be shy and indulge yourself in all that is the Capital Grille.     Please Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

I'm not trying to be a snob, but if a place has a dress code why is it not enforced? This group also continued to carry on vulgar conversation (f-this, f-that).  If I wanted to hear that I would be at the NASCAR store, not an Uptown restaurant.  I should have requested a different table, but that group departed soon after and I left it alone.  The service was 5-stars.  Our waitress attended to our every need and we had a delightful dinner, absolutely top notch.  The food was a bit disappointing.  The steaks were cooked perfectly to order, but they were nothing special.  They were not particularly tender or seasoned with anything I could taste.  The sides were fantastic.  I don't know if we just went on an off night, but for the prices they were charging the meat fell far short.  If not for that, I would give the place 5 stars.",

Aside from Beef and Bottle on South Blvd., Capital Grille is one of the first upscale steak places that Charlotte had.  It's been here longer than Mortons, Ruth Chris or Palm, etc.  So in some ways I feel like the other's are just riding coat tails in Charlotte.  Of course, it is a chain so with that being said I'm sure this isn't the original one.  The filet oscar and lobster mac 'n cheese are simply put \"my last meal on earth\".

    "text": "\"I'm in the mood for a juicy steak!\" are words that I rarely utter but  my experience at Capital Grille literally had me eating my words. On this night, my friends and I took advantage of The Capital Grille's Charlotte Restaurant Week menu that consisted of three courses. For my starter, I went with the Wedge salad topped with applewood smoked bacon and blue cheese. The salad was simply delicious and dressed perfectly with the right amount of dressing. For the second course, I chose the porcini rubbed tenderloin. This is the part where I drool... that steak, man that steak! That piece of meat was prepared and seasoned to perfection; it was hands down the best steak that I've ever had! This marvelous piece of heaven was served with green beans and mashed potatoes. And now for the grand finale: chocolate espresso cake (close your mouth) lol. This dessert was simply marvelous. The coffee and chocolate complimented each other making each bite better than the last. The texture of the cake was a hybrid between a mousse and a cake...very creamy. I can't end this review  without mentioning the impeccable service. We were seated nearly 20 minutes later than our reservation, but upon being seated, we were greeted and served with a smile for the remainder of our dining experience. Eating my words never tasted so good!",

Really top notch professionals - not once did I have to look around for a server when I wanted something. THey anticipated without \"hovering.\" I hate hoverers more than I hate servers who ignore you. There is a fine balance, and Capital Grille hits it squarely.

Or maybe you're a gansta who dresses like CiLo Green and wants to show the hunny's (yes, a group of them out with one man) a night on the town.  Or maybe you are a group of ladies who can't figure out why the Bravo TV Channel passed Charlotte over for the next cast of Real Housewives?  If you fall into any of these three categories, this is the joint for you.  In all honesty, I have seen all three scenarios mentioned above play out during each of the three times I've been to this restaurant (as for the third scenario, there must have been a Real Housewives convention or something in town...there were no fewer than 5 tables of cougars decked to the 9's trying to impress SOMEone....)  The food is good, not great.  Their steaks are great cuts of meat, but I can get their roasted chicken off the rotisserie at Harris Teeter, and their fish is always dry.  I won't harp on their oysters, as it was out-of-season when I got them, and that's not a fair shake, but still....No Bueno.  Go for the top tier steak...steer clear of apps. and other proteins.  The service, managers, and hostesses here are all as pretentious as the surroundings.  Funny story; my friends got turned away due to the places dress code.  They weren't given that reason, but come on...they walked into an empty restaurant, were given elevator eyes by the hostess, and were told that all the empty tables had \"reservations attached to them\".  And we are not talking bums off the street here...this was a Brooks Brothers and TRCW wearin' couple!  Bottom line...leave the jeans at home for this place...may even want to throw on a jacket to improve your chances with St. Peter at the Pearly Gates...I mean, the hostess at the podium.  Overall, if you feel the need to define your restaurant experience by how much you spend, and the number of \"important\" people sitting next to you, go here.  If you want good food, and don't feel like taking out a second mortgage on your home to enjoy a nice meal, pass on this one.  As far as high-end steakhouses go, might I suggest Ruth's Chris (right down the street) or Del Friscos (South Park) as better alternatives to this place?  Del Frisco's is my personal choice, due to the fact that I always see Ric Flair here, and he entertains me...WOOOOO!",

Not only was the food delicious, but we were treated incredibly well by the staff, particularly our server Rebecca... I truly felt like a VIP!!  Our meal included a complimentary amuse bouche (a cucumber slice filled with a lobster salad), and when our friend informed the staff that he's allergic to shellfish, they immediately produced an alternate dish for him.    The salad I split with my fiance was a fresh mozzarella/basil/tomato/balsamic salad.  The server split this tableside for us, and even brought an extra plate with the 12 yr aged balsamic and EVOO drizzle.  Delicious.  For the entree, I temporarily suspended my usual vegetarian-pescatarian diet for a Filet Oscar (filet with crab served on top).  Medium rare as requested, as was my fiance's delmonico.  Again, delicious.  I should also mention here that the potatoes au gratin side dish were phenomenal and highly recommended.  At the end of the meal, we were presented with a complimentary champagne toast and four mini \"pot o' creme\" desserts.  These were incredible and somewhat like a ganache.    We finished our experience with another bottle of champagne and three desserts to share between the four of us:  chocolate hazelnut cake, cheesecake, and creme brulee.  I have to say that this cheesecake is some of the best I've had and it has to to with the crust and the creme-brulee-like topping.  Definitely a must-try if you order dessert on your visit.  Our desserts were also on the house, in honor of our friend's job and my fiance and I's recent engagement.  This meal was probably the best all-around I've had in Charlotte, and perhaps anywhere.  Excellent food, outstanding service.",

    "text": "It's been 5 years since my last review so maybe it's time for a freshening.  I go to the Capital Grille about 8 times a year, mostly for special occasions.  I went last night for the 19th anniversary of Sweeties 28th birthday.  We took the 2 children since who am I to deny them a great dinner.  The night was icy / snowy and it was glorious driving to uptown since none of the other crazies were out.  We valeted the car and were greeted by Richard one of the Managers.  Nice booth in the back and we're off to the races.  Peter and David took great care of us as always.  Very attentive and conversational without being overly pushy.    They have a children's menu here and imo it's one of the best in Charlotte.  For chump change you can feed your kids traditional kids food (Chicken fingers, grilled cheese etc...) and it allows you to have a nice night out while enjoying your food.  Started with the Tomato Mozz salad with balsamic and it was amazing.  They make their mozz in house every 2 hours or something and you can tell that it's fresh.  I went to my favorite, porcini rubbed ribeye with 15 year aged balsamic vinegar.  It's quite simply heaven on a plate, really.  They added a few new sides and one is the glazed Brussels sprouts which we tried on David's recommendation and they were glorious.  They normally come with bacon but we decided to forego the cured pig since Sweetie is a pescaterian.  Dessert, was gratis for Sweetie's birthday but we added a cheesecake for our daughter and a scoop of vanilla for the other daughter.  All the desserts were excellent.    Now here's the kicker.  When we last were there for my anniversary about 4 months ago, there was a misstep, not a big deal....but a misstep nonetheless.  I called the next day and they apologized and all was right in the world.  When we were there yesterday when David brought us our check they noted the misstep from 4 months ago and gave us a credit for Sweetie's salmon.  Who does that?  The Capital Grille, that's who.  Amazing service right?  Anyway.  I will continue to patronize this amazing place for many years to come.  The Management Staff are all excellent and this location runs like a well oiled machine.  John, Richard, and now Bradley are all there for you and you should go there now!!!",

Absolutely delicious. I go with the bar menu version. Smaller portion than the entree. I pour the wasabi oil over all of it... then take alternate dipping pieces in the other two. Money.  End every meal here with a shot of Sambucca. Trust me on that one.",

    "text": "Ok so to be honest there was nothing wrong with the experience I just wasn't really impressed by anything. We came here for our anniversary a few nights ago and wanted to try one of the nicer restaurants that we hadn't been to yet. Upon walking in we were greeted by the hostess who asked us our reso time and were told that they were getting our table ready and would be seated shortly. We walked over to the bar to grab some drinks while we waited the bar staff was friendly and took our order right away. Moments later we were guided to our table which had tiny hearts all over it which was a cute touch for our anniversary. The service was ok a bit slow and our server seemed extremely tired but nice. He suggested some features and took our order, I got the filet with mashed potatoes and the mozzarella and tomato salad and my guy got the salmon with green beans and creamed spinach.   The salad was alright the best part being the mozzarella which was light and delicate and very very fresh. The main courses came and my steak was just sort of alright. It lacked flavor but was cooked correctly it just sort of tasted like they cooked the steak and that's it no salt pepper or seasoning of any kind it seemed not really at all what I expected based on the reviews for this place. The mashed potatoes were pretty good almost too creamy though for lack of a better way to describe them I guess. My guys salmon tasted pretty good but nothing out of this world either and the creamed spinach had an odd flavor that I just can't put my finger on but my guy said he liked them so that made me happy. Overall for the price we paid for the food $186 before tip it just wasn't worth it in my eyes and there's really nothing more that I love to drop money on other than good food on a night out but this just won't be one of the places we come back to. Makes me sad I had been meaning to come to this place for years we just always went to Ruth's Chris when we had a date night since it's our favorite but decided to break from tradition this time.   The service like I said he just seemed completely exhausted so not gonna really hold it against him they were busy and I can understand as he did his best and took our picture for our anniversary which was great. They have complimentary valet out front which I would recommend but free spots on the street on weekends and nights but good luck finding one.   Overall personally if your gonna spend upwards of 200 on two entrees and a couple drinks with a salad and some sides or even more if you have more people I think there's better options but to each their own.",

We are both young and we usually get shoved in a corner and nearly forgotten at nice restaurants, but not here!  Our server was Ken and he was wonderful! He was funny and professional and provided just the right amount of assistance. The manager stopped by on several occasions to check in, and everyone was handing out birthday well wishes.   I had the citrus seared salmon and my boyfriend had the Kona crusted bone in sirloin. We shared a Caesar salad and the au gratin potatoes. Everything was cooked just right and delicious. By far the best Salmon I've ever had!   We tried the signature pineapple martini, which really packs a punch! And we were given cheese cake and flourless espresso chocolate cake for the birthday boy. Both desserts were amazing. I would definitely order the cheese cake again!   It is an expensive restaurant, but I really felt like the expense was worth it! Great service and great food can't be beat!",

I had a business lunch there once and didn't eat much of my food because we were so engaged in conversation. I realized later that I really was impressed with what I ordered, which must be why I didn't bother to eat. So, for that reason, I hadn't had the desire to dine there since. This weekend I decided to accept a birthday dinner invite and give them another try since it's been a few years. Terrible mistake! I ordered the chicken dish. Yeah, there's basically only one. It was so tasteless except for the char flavor, that I literally had taken one bite and decided my meal was over. My plate sat at the table for the remainder of the evening. The wait staff never once asked about it. Never offered to get me something else. Even when they asked if I wanted it boxed, never inquired about why I was throwing out a full plate. NEVER AGAIN! People love to splurge here, but there are much better options in CLT",

    "text": "4.5 stars and rounding up to 5; quite a feat given that within a 1-mile radius, you have Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, Morton's, McCormick and Schmick's -- not to mention Chima and BLT Steakhouse (we have been to all of these either in Charlotte or somewhere else around the world).  I have to say that out of all the restaurants in Charlotte (in the short 5 months that I've lived here), Capital Grille (\"CG\") is my favorite because it: (1) has an idyllic ambience; (2) has stellar service; (3) has delicious food; and (4) is consistent in its delivery.  Fun fact: I'm sure all you Charlotteons know this but CG is featured in Shallow Hal and still looks exactly the same.  Worldwide consistency.  We have been to CG in Orange County, Chicago, Mexico City -- to name a few -- and every time, every experience is the same, from the restaurant decor to the service to the food, whether you're dining indoors, on a patio, or lunch or for dinner, on a week day/night or weekend.  When we go to CG anywhere, anytime, including this Charlotte location, I know exactly what to expect and they deliver on point every time, without exception.  Idyllic ambience.  There is something comforting about feeling like you're coming back to the same restaurant even though you're in a different city.  CG is old school traditional, like a cigar or country club, with its dark woods, white linen tables, and all-male waitstaff.  They are literally frozen in time; they know what works and have stuck with it adamantly.  Their tables are set far enough apart, the ceiling heights and rooms are sufficiently insulated as to promote an aura of privacy to enhance your dining experience, regardless of how busy they are (esp on Friday or Saturday nights).  I personally prefer to sit on their patio, which does take in some of the city noise (especially cars that rumble by, blaring their speakers) but it is lushly landscaped and tucked back enough from the street that it feels like a serene reprieve from the bustle of the city.  Outstanding service.  The service is impeccable every time.  They seamlessly refill your drinks, serve various courses, remove plates and silverware with timed efficiency so that you have what you need, when you need it and whatever you don't want is gone in a flash.  The staff works in unison in teams and they do it in the least obtrusive way possible as to enhance your dining experience.  Delectable food.  In 5 months in Charlotte alone, we've been to CG Charlotte 5 times and have never been served anything that was less than delicious.  When we're in the mood for steak and seafood, this is our go-to place and like the restaurant, we stick to what we know works.   +++++Complimentary breads.  The array of fresh warm breads is splendid; the breads are moist, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The butter is absolutely wonderful.  You can ask for the specific bread that you want (I prefer the dark bread, my BF prefers the sourdough). +++++Cocktail shrimp.  These jumbo-sized shrimp are fresh and succulent; the cocktail sauce has just the right amount of kick to it and is very flavorful. +++++Oysters.  These were my favorite oysters in Charlotte until I discovered the heavenly ones at Baku (review to follow shortly) but in their own right, they are marvelous.  They aren't overly briny, they are always fresh (see my review and corresponding warning of Pearlz Oyster Bar) and are always absolutely marvelous. +++++Caesar salad.  The Caesar salad is perfect: every piece of lettuce is crisp and fresh; the croutons are crispy and garlicky; and the dressing is divine with its thick creaminess, with just a hint of lemon, garlic and anchovy. +++++Lobster bisque.  The bisque is heavenly; the lobster is sweet and fresh, the broth is creamy, buttery, semi-sweet incorporating  the right blend of saltiness. +++++Lobster salad.  This salad is divine; the lobster is fresh and sweet but the star is the citrus vinaigrette that really enhances the lobster flavor with just the right balance of tart and semi-sweet. +++++Lobster Mac and cheese.  The lobster Mac and cheese is very cheesy, so much so that when you pull it on your fork, the cheese kind of glides onto your fork into your mouth.  You have to eat this pretty fast or it dries up and you lose the ooze effect. +++++Mashed potatoes.  These potatoes are garlicky, nicely salted with the perfect blend of creaminess; they're densely fluffy -- oxymoron, I know, but that's what they are. +++++Rib eye.  The rib eye is tender, moist, juicy and cooked to your preference (we like medium rare).  They do have A1 sauce but they definitely don't drown out the natural beef flavor with anything else. +++++creme brulee.  The creme brulee is not overly decadent; it is vanilla flavored, the custard is thick but not overpowering or decadent in its sweetness.    Overall, if you're looking for a solid semi-casual traditional steakhouse restaurant, I highly recommend Capital Grille, especially on their outdoor patio.",

So, let's compare and contrast them to the competition; Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, Morton's, McCormick and Schmick's, Sullivan's, Chima, and BLT Steak.  Ruth's Chris ... feels like a prom-night teen dinner experience in comparison  Fleming's ... waaaay over-rated and unpolished, a tourist village, the fifties called and they want their restaurant back  Morton's ... elite, but stop pitching it to me, I'm already sitting at the table  McCormick and Schmick's ... eating fish in a large cafeteria setting with cheap carpeting  Sullivan's Steakhouse ... the opposite of Capital Grill, all-around bad  Chima Brazilian Steakhouse ... all you can stand to eat of B-level cuisine   BLT Steak ... their core competency is running a great hotel  You get the idea. I'm hard to please and I really like Capital Grill. The only minor ding I have for them is this. My wife and I have dined here for fifteen years; everything from late lunches to very special occasions. Why is it every time we are seated, the first question is; \"have you dined with us before?\"",

Their appetizers are well made, I particularly like their blue wedge salad, but their onion soup is a close second. On the menu for the second course you have to get one of their signature dishes (Kona crusted sirloin or the Porcini crusted Delmonico with aged balsamic - my all time favorite!)  Drinks and cocktails are good and they have a good wine list. Their desserts are nothing out of this world (but I'm not a dessert guy). The service is clean and proper.

The staff is uber friendly and accommodating, and they have almost anything you'd desire to eat... all the way from soups, to burgers, to chicken, to various seafood entrees.   Appetizers: 10/10 would order the fried Calamari every time. Delicious, and with an added bonus of cherry & banana peppers thrown in.   Their lobster bisque is divine ... a must before each meal. Come hungry, or don't come at all.  Entrees: Their fish of the day is usually always a good call. For menu items, I love the Chilean Sea Bass, as well as the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon. If you're looking for beef ... they use Wagyu beef and they're massive. The filet mignon is seared to perfection.     Dessert: All are made in house --- so you know they're made with love! The cheesecake with fresh berries in some of my favorite cheesecake, and the flourless chocolate espresso cake is heavenly.

Decided to go to capital grille tonight and couldn't be happier with that decision. The food was amazing! Ryan was our server and he did an awesome job describing all of the food (and the wine ;) )! He made the entire experience awesome and I will definitely go back! If you haven't been here yet, take the time to go. I promise you won't regret it. And if possible, definitely request Ryan as your server. You can thank me later!",

Why so?  - The service is phenomenal, wait staff do not bat an eye at any requests and offer that congenial mix of Southern formality and hospitality with a genteel and warm-hearted aplomb  - The crowd is the perfect mix of old families spanning generations of aged grandparents, dapper parents, and bow-tie clad children, to buttoned-down business types, and even the more informal polo-clad athletic types  - Food, they present and cook everything perfectly.  The menu is slightly seasonal, which is surprising, and the seafood is the best in this landlocked area  - Very good overall ambiance, it has the dark wood and oil paintings that are part and parcel to CGs, however, the room is relatively well lit and there is an outdoor seating area and open kitchen which reflects a more modern vibe",

The lobster bisque was so good we have even discussed sneaking in tupperwear and ordering enough for 6 people to take extra servings home (we wouldn't really, but it is THAT good!). We had the seafood tower as well and it was stunning. The tower itself was beautiful and the seafood was wonderful. We split the aged ribeye and it was phenomenal and plenty for 2 people.   We will be returning again for our next special occasion.",

The steak I ordered was every bit of 2 steps overcooked. Asparagus was literally room temperature. Lobster mac and cheese was barely warm and the chicken dish was warm at best. That stuff should be so hot that I can't even eat it. I sent the steak back, and my other half seemed happy with everything else even though it was all cold. Sometimes not worth the fight. I ordered a rare TBone and received medium. Sent it back and what I received as a replacement was an extremely undercooked half of a Tbone. What looked like one of the reject steaks. It was cut off on the bottom of the 'T' and a tenderloin nugget. This is supposed to be a 24oz Porterhouse. Not half a strip and a tenderloin nugget. The thing was so rare It was unbelievable and NOT in a good way. Certainly not sending another steak back after my other half was already done eating. Not gonna lie its gonna take me a while to get over this terrible experience. 2nd star is only because of the service.",

    "text": "I'm torn. I could care less about price if it's worth it. Ex: food is spectacular, service is spectacular. I went for a very early NYE dinner (think before the 6pm hour, so def not crowded). There was good and bad. Good: the dirty vodka martini was spot on. The Brussels sprouts were phenomenal!! The cheesecake made me cry tears of joy while I ate it, and I hate cheesecake. Oh dear lord, it was good.  The BAD: umm, my steak. The first one, a waiter-not ours-set down was not what I ordered. A second \"correct\" one was quickly brought to me...but after 4 or 5 bites, I realized-either this is the worlds most flavorless ribeye, or again, I was served the wrong steak. However, I had eaten into it and didn't want to send back-even my husband agreed it probably wasn't the ribeye I'd ordered. And the service-also not good. The waiter at the table next to us chatted them up, asked about their plans, hell-even told them the specials. Something our waiter never did. I'd loved to have known so I could have ordered some. Ours disappeared after the steaks hit. No checking to see if things were ok, no follow up. My martini ran dry. My husbands beer ran dry. We saw our waiter briefly when he asked if we wanted dessert. I did indeed!! But had I known it would show up about 30 min later, well, I might have passed. Cheesecake, y'all. Nothing exotic, Halfway through desert, our waiter reappeared to simply drop the check and leave. I paid while eating, then decided I was full and would love to have a box for the dessert I paid for. So we sat. And waited. And waited. And WAAAAAIIIITEDDDDD.  Mind you, it's maybe 6:30 pm at this point.   So I won't go back. For the price point-I need great, not ok. All I needed in life was a kick ass steak and vodka martini. I got half. There's better places to blow your money, y'all.",

Never a mistake made by them and would always go in almost monthly. 6 weeks ago I had some friends in town and we decided to hit the capital grille. I had accidentally made my reservation for the wrong night but they accommodated us anyways which was much appreciated. The waiter was great but my steak came out extremely undercooked so I sent it back and they returned my same cut in half steak that was now burnt and I couldn't enjoy it but still had to pay. Meanwhile we had a 500 dollar tab- I find this unacceptable out of a restaurant this nice so will have to start frequenting Sullivan's who I am confident would make this right.",

Our server (who did a great job) brought us some fresh yellow roses for the table.   I had the shaved Brussels sprout salad as an appetizer and it was amazing. There were huge hunks of bacon in it. Husband had clam chowder and said it was very good.   For entrees, I had the sliced filet with mushrooms and fig sauce. It was delicious. My husband ordered the plain filet cooked medium, but it came out medium rare. We got lobster mac and cheese and mashed potatoes for sides. I was somewhat underwhelmed at the side items. The mac and cheese was too salty and the lobster was sparse. The mashed potatoes were over pureed.   Our server brought us dessert on the house for our anniversary. It was two miniature desserts: gluten free chocolate something or other and brulee cheesecake. The chocolate thing was too rich for our taste, but the cheesecake? Oh my goodness, delicious!   I also had a really delightful Pinot noir with my meal. Can't remember the name of it but it was $11 per glass and I loved it.   Don't get me wrong -- this was a great experience -- however, it is my opinion that the prices here are designed to attract a certain clientele and repel others. I don't think it is exactly a reflection of the quality of the food. Just my two cents!  I would still recommend the Capital Grille for special occasions.",

As someone who commonly eats at Prime Steakhouses such as the Capital Grille, Fleming's, Morton's, etc. This is by far the worst experience I've ever had in my life. The food quality here is extremely low, and I went on a Saturday night, so the A-team should be there. My girlfriend and I got the Tuna Tartare as an appetizer, it was unseasoned, and bland. She ate one bite. For our entrees, She got the Scallops and the asparagus, to which she told me they were overcooked. I got the Tenderloin and Lobster Tails, with steak cooked medium-rare. When the food was brought out it was well done, no pink whatsoever. As for the service, even though it seems impossible, it was WORSE than the food. As a young couple, 26&25, we felt discriminated against, even though we go out to eat religiously and tip very well. I NEVER complain or ask for management, in this case I did. The \"manager\" was completely dismissive of our complaint and did not even acknowledge our dissatisfaction, despite me informing him we would never be back. I could not me more disappointed in this location. Awful from top to bottom.",

I ended up only having Lobster Mac and Cheese. (I'd already had a recovery meal after party #1) It was okay. Could have used a boost in flavor somewhere. Maybe some salt. My biggest concern was my drink. Is that bad? I'm concerned with my drink. Anyway, I ordered a Sidecar. It came in a goblet style glass full of ice. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Are Sidecars not to be served up? With actual Cognac? I figured Capital would know better than that. Other than that my large group was served well. They even threw some berries on a platter with my cake that my friends brought. Nice touch. Oh, and we saw celebrities, like face to face. Thank goodness CIAA will be back for six more years!!",

Wine selections are awesome, as well as menu selection. If you're going to get a cut of meat get it here, especially the lamb. Easy on the sides...they can accommodate two people easily. It's a high end restaurant in central Uptown, so save it for an occasion...it's an easy mid 3 figure check without the gratuity. Totally worth it once in awhile.",

I had let them know it would be a first date experience and they pulled out all the stops.  They chose a very romantic table setting and the service was terrific.  The waiter was a little overly friendly and was a bit uncomfortable toward the end of the meal. The setting, environment, and welcoming staff were the highlights.  For the price I felt the food could have been better.  For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar.  The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good. For the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning.  Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp.  They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender.  The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic.  Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat.  Still, a VERY good cut of steak. The meal and a bottle of wine ran me $150 which for the service and ambience I believe is fair.  I'll most definitely be going back to give the chef another chance to WOW me.",

I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end!   Capital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: \"It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.\" It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to!   But I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.  Capital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!",

    "text": "I don't usually write reviews but I have to make an exception because of my experience today at The Capital Grille. This is my favorite restaurant, but I don't usually go there unless it is a business expense, because of the more upscale pricing.  Today is our 10th wedding anniversary. We had been having a wonderful day and were about to top it off with dinner at a nice restaurant that we frequented. We were leaving downtown and happened to pass @The Capital Grille. I made the offhanded remark that we should have made a reservation to eat there instead of the other place. My wife calls just to see if they might find us a table.  She spoke to the managing partner, Armin. He was very friendly and asked he what the occasion was. When she told him it was our anniversary, He was like \"Sure, come on. We'll definitely get you a table\"! When we arrived, with 10 minutes notice, they had a table waiting for us...A table with stars, hearts and diamond glitter stickers sprinkled all over the table cloth! The maitre' D brought us complimentary champagne and the chef also sent us complimentary appetizers. When my wife ordered the lobster, the chef also gave her the biggest lobster they offered at the same price as the smaller one.   The calamari was fantastic and had the kick of the peppers and the savory flavor of the beer batter that I remember from earlier visits. My entree' was a gorgonzola crusted sirloin with a carbernet reduction sauce. Wow! Just like I would hope for an anniversary meal. Soft and succulent. It melted on my palate like butter. Mmmm Mmmm. My wife is a small lady but she ate an entire 3 pound lobster by herself. Need I say more?  Our server Kimberly was excellent and super attentive. Our glasses were never empty. Nothing but compliments to her. Armin, the managing partner, came to talk to us several times during the meal. That personal touch made the meal very enjoyable. The chef sent us an exquisite dessert plate to end the meal as a compliment also. To top it off, Kimberly also took our picture and put it in a frame and gave it to us along with a card from the management wishing us Happy Anniversary.  If you are visiting Charlotte, you owe it to yourself to visit this great restaurant. If you live in Charlotte and can afford to splurge on a meal once in a while, if you haven't been to The Capital Grille, then shame on you! Fix that oversight now!",

Ambiance: This place is a fine establishment, which you notice walking in. They greet you warmly, take your coat, and do the right things when you enter.  The restaurant was quite busy, and noisy as well. We were fortunate having a large group, so we were seated in a dining area where we could close a set of doors. This helped tremendously!  Wine choices are plentiful, they did a fine job with mixed drinks and everyone was pleased with the drinks.  Food was also excellent. We had several appetizers and they were all good to excellent. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes. Slightly crispy, and delicious.  For the main, I chose the 10 oz. filet, which came perfectly prepared. The pumpkin cheesecake for dessert was very nice, but a little too sweet I think.  Overall, the meal for our group was excellent. The price for this meal was over our normal expectations, even for Charlotte. It was the only slight disappointment in our group's evening.",

    "text": "I'm sorry Capital Grille I really wanted to give you four stars but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.  I'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected, their hospitality is as good as ever. The problem is I didn't exactly enjoy my meal as much as I would have hoped even though I still had a good time surrounded by friends and family.  Appetizers came out in a very timely manner once menu choices were made. I chose clam chowder based on a recommendation. Well it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, a well made clam chowder is one of my favorite things to eat so this was a bit of a let down. My entree a Kona crusted dry aged sirloin was perfectly cooked and served with a nice composite shallot butter how old school! The only problem is that they didn't cook all the steaks as well as mine. One person had ordered a medium steak and it came out well done and extremely charred (It was comped when she mentioned it and the waiter and manager were very sorry and concerned about this so I'll have to thumbs up them for handling a situation so graciously). The shallot butter though didn't really add anything to the dish for me and the steak wasn't so flavorful that it could stand on it's own. The best part of the meal? Dessert! But not my dessert, I was talked up on the ice cream and decided to order it instead of creme brulee. Well that was a major mistake on my part. My whole meal had been heavy and if I had went with sorbet I might have been able to finish it, but I decided on ice cream. Peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream was just too much to handle for me and I called it quits after a spoonful of each. The creme brulee was still as addictive as ever from what I tried on someone's plate though!  I would go back here just for the service alone. It's really nice to be treated like they really care about your visit. It might be a while before I head back though but cheers Capital Grille!",

We got there early for a 9 pm reservation and surprisingly even the bar was full on a Wednesday night, so we went across the street for a drink. Guess not everybody is in their pajamas by that time like we are. Everything went smoothly, free valet parking, table was ready right away when we got back from our drink, excellent service (almost a rushed feeling though). However, i wasn't too impressed with the Caesar salad and honestly i was kind of disappointed with my filet. Filets are the only steak i really enjoy, but to me this just tasted like a normal steak, nothing special. Ruth's Chris wins in my book. The potatoes and spinach were a good side.  The highlight of the night was the Creme Brulee Cheesecake, it was awesome. Definitely a fan of that cheesecake and the atmosphere, but in comparison with other steakhouses, for me the meal was just OK.",

Now that I am in Charlotte, I was able to try out another Capital Grille location and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my mom in uptown Charlotte. This outpost of The Capital Grille was bustling before noon on a Monday. Many business meetings and lunches are held here and the obviously enthusiastic staff kept things running smoothly and truly went above and beyond even with a close to full a house. At lunch parking is validated for the lot behind the Dunhill Hotel, making it a reasonable $2.  The Plates menu features choice of a soup or salad, an entree and a side dish for a set price of $18 at the Charlotte location. For the summer menu, a new entree of seared scallops with sweet and sour tomatoes is available. I love how the scallops are served with a grilled lemon wedge for a citrus taste that goes perfectly with the beautifully presented and cooked shellfish - delicious. The other new additions to the menu include a carrot ginger soup (hot) which I also really liked (the tasty classic New England clam chowder is still available as well) and a tomato and watermelon salad with feta cheese - a refreshing option for a side dish. The Wagyu beef burger with fried egg and crispy onions is back on the menu following multiple requests after it was featured last summer and then removed. My mom ordered this and LOVED it - and she is not usually a fan of burgers at all. The truffle fries go great with the burger, which is really a treat.",

    "text": "Honestly, next time we're in the mood for a good steak we're going to get in the car, drive directly to Fresh Market and purchase the premium filets. They are about half the price, but more importantly the quality of the meat is superior.  My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese had several large chunks of lobster that were tender and perfect. My tomato salad came with underripe overly thick slices of tomato on top (which generally made the whole thing look unnappetizing). I'd say it's a reasonable request that if a tomato salad is offered you'd better have ripe tomato, no? Under the thick slices there were some very tasty red, gold, and chocolate colored grape tomatoes that had marinated in the balsamic nicely- those were really good and I did enjoy that part.  Overall the reason we went to Capital Grille in the first place was to enjoy some steak, they fell squarely in the category of mediocre and when taking into account price point Id say sub par. There are better places for the price point, we won't be back unless my husband has a craving for the lobster mac and cheese . . .",

    "text": "OK, so I Yelp on a curve.  My expectations of quality, technique, ambiance, flavor, service, seasoning, skill, knowledge, presentation and value are directly proportionate to the dollars spent and the locality in which it is enjoyed.   I can not apply the same degree of criticism at Torchy's for $10 as I do at Per Se for $500 ... although they both deserve 5 stars based on the above criteria.  This brings me to The Capital Grille in Charlotte....    Design and decor get high ratings for the old school, old boys steak house feel. However more modern interpretations like Houston's/Hillstone or J.Alexander's score higher and feel better.   The service was knowledgeable, but rushed, and not attentive.Not bad in any way but not what I would expect from a place that seems so polished, pretentious and more importantly so expensive. Lets just say I have had much better service for half the price... ( recently Acme in Chapel Hill but I have yet to get to that review)  Food ... OK $40 an entree  ala carte, $10 sides, those are NYC, LA, SF  prices. I expect it to be of comparable quality...... Sadly it was not.    The menu list \"daily seafood feature\", when I asked it was, I was told filet(beef) medallions with scallops .... sorry Chef .... that may feature seafood, but it is not a \"seafood feature\" !    Between the 2 of us we had -   Cedar Plank salmon, slightly over cooked, vastly under seasoned ( my better half rarely salts anything she did this)  Bone in NY ordered mid-rare, received very much on the rare side, slightly cold, flavor was good, but undercooked and served with a slightly roasted shallot that was still crunchy (not cooked enough), not the sweet, soft, unctuousness that it could have been.  Potato gratin ( $10) needed an extra 15 min. in the oven, the potatoes were not cooked through... and there was a very very strong raw garlic flavor, AND there was plastic wrap inside ! .. In fairness I understand this happens occasionally and it and the dessert were comped, however I see a trend of sloppiness with the food that should not be happening at this price point.  Grilled Asparagus ($10) it was ok ... but just ok.   Dessert creme brule, ......nothing special...  thin  not very crisp carmel, made worse by too many wet berries, and a strawberry fan garnish which even in the darkly lit dining room (as opposed to the kitchen) I could see was past its prime.  it was a $50 dinner for more than $150, so I think that   \"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums it up ............ 2 stars",

It was my first time trying calamari and the Stoli Doli - both sublime.  As was everything else I consumed.  I've been wanting to return since then, but budgetary restraints prohibit.  Hopefully we'll go again someday.",

They set me up a special table in the corner, and even served us a free bottle of celebratory champagne.  The food here was delicious, the wait staff attentive, and the wine always filled.  They also served me one of the best porterhouse steaks I've had in my entire life!  It is a bit pricey but well worth it!",

    "text": "Consistently great.  Every time we go, the food and the service exceed our expectations.   And as good as the food is, it's even more about the fantastic people who serve the fantastic food.   Calling it \"service\" almost demeans the high level of professionalism and friendliness that are the hallmarks of the CG team.  The serving professionals at CG are like old friends that you want to just invite to sit down and chat, and yet their speed and professionalism are unmatched.  Lots of great examples to share, but I'll refrain, other than to say both Michelle and Alex are phenomenal.    The menu is not inspired, but that's very much OK - it is consistently A+ quality.   You know what you're going to get, every time.   CG is a go-to place; as good as it gets.",

    "text": "This is the classic Capital Grille experience.  And that is a classy, high-end one at that.  The product here is very similar to other Capital Grille's, so I will not go into detail.  The point I was wanting to make here is that I happened to be out with a co-worker who is a very experienced bar man who's also a bit of a foodie and really enjoys a good restaurant.  So, being a classy place, he started ordering some really traditional drinks that you just don't hear of much these days.  The bartender at this Capital Grille was definitely up to the measure required for CG staff and the high-end product they deliver.  A couple drinks we had made are a Baby Guiness (which I had never heard of myself).  Barman knew exactly what to do, even the pour over the back of a spoon.  Another was Sambuca, which was expertly paired with 3 coffee beans.  The guy knew what he was doing.  And it was done smartly.  Capital Grille - always a good fine dining experience.",

    "text": "After having experienced a business lunch at Capital Grill within the last year, I decided to treat my family (wife and two teenage boys) to a dinner at Capital Grill during Restaurant Week in Charlotte.  I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.    Let's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.    The service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress.",
